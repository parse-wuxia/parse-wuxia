<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>Volume 4: Chapter 14 - Stirring the Heart</strong></span></p><p><span style="">When I walked out of the room, it was quiet. Where had everyone gone? When I reached the lower floor of the dormitory, I met the dormitory&#x2019;s receptionist, an old man. He grinned at me. &#x201C;You&#x2019;re already late for class! Why aren&#x2019;t you rushing?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">I was in shock. &#x201C;What time is it? Why am I late?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">He replied, &#x201C;If you don&#x2019;t hurry up, the third period of the morning classes will soon end.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Ah! It was already that late. After thanking him, I rushed out of the dormitory. When I reached the entrance of the classroom, Teacher Si Lan Yu was teaching the class. Let&#x2019;s just face the music! It&#x2019;s just being late anyways.</span></p><p><span style="">I shouted, &#x201C;Permission to enter!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Teacher Yu replied, &#x201C;Enter!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">I pushed open the classroom door. When I walked into the classroom, I lowered my head. &#x201C;Teacher, I&#x2019;m sorry for being late.&#x201D; I could feel that all of the students are looking in my direction.</span></p><p><span style="">Teacher Yu said, &#x201C;Please remember to be on time next time and quickly take your seat.&#x201D; &#x2018;</span><i><span style="">Teacher Yu is really so easy going! Haha, it seems that I&#x2019;ve been let off the hook! I calm down and sit back in my seat. Something feels different today. The gazes in the students&#x2019; eyes aren&#x2019;t as complicated. All of their eyes seems to all be filled with respect and even have signs of longings instead. It looks like the victory over Feng Liang had a huge effect in the class</span></i><span style="">!&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">I peeked at Mu Zi, who was at my side. She was the only one who hadn&#x2019;t looked at me since I entered the classroom. I whispered to her, &#x201C;Hey, were you there when I fought against Feng Liang yesterday?</span></p><p><span style="">Mu Zi didn&#x2019;t look at me and coldly replied, &#x201C;I wasn&#x2019;t and please stop talking to me during class.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">I pouted and took a piece of paper out from my bag to resume the love letter battle. I frantically wrote on the paper and didn&#x2019;t even bother to head out during the break. Finally, after the fourth period, I finished writing my 2000 word masterpiece.</span></p><p><span style="">What I wrote wasn&#x2019;t corny at all. It was the feelings I had felt when I sparred with Feng Liang. I used the remaining few sentences to express my feelings for Mu Zi. I flipped through the pages. &#x2018;</span><i><span style="">I hope this time Mu Zi won&#x2019;t tear it up. If she really tears it up, it will mean failure. I won&#x2019;t have any more chances to make her fall for me. Currently, I don&#x2019;t know why, but my feelings of revenge are lessening. I even like her cold attitude instead of hating it.&#x2019;</span></i></p><p><span style="">I placed the papers on her table and waited to see if she would take them. She turned her head and glared at me while I smiled back at her. She took a look at the papers and, found that they weren&#x2019;t some corny love letter, but a battle analysis. She became serious and looked really interested in what she was reading. &#x2018;</span><i><span style="">There&#x2019;s hope! Haha! Wonderful!&#x2019;</span></i></p><p><span style="">Mu Zi flipped through the pages and wrote a few words on the last page before handing them back to me. I almost screamed out in joy because she didn&#x2019;t tear up my letter and even replied. A soothing feeling passed through my entire body.</span></p><p><span style="">I took back the letter and saw a line of unkempt words. &#x2018;</span><i><span style="">I was shocked not because of what she wrote, but rather because her handwriting was just too awful! It looked just like tadpole writing.&#x2019; </span></i><span style="">I turned my head to look at her before looking back at her writing. While suppressing my laughter, I seriously tried to decipher the words from her tadpole handwriting.</span></p><p><i><span style="">&#x2018;Luckily, my deciphering skills were strong and I somewhat understood what she had written: &#x2018;You are indeed very strong as you were able to defeat Feng Liang Ri, but it is just impossible for us to be together. From now on, please stop disturbing me.&#x2019;</span></i></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;</span><i><span style="">As I read her words, I didn&#x2019;t feel any sadness, but instead became extremely happy! I&#x2019;ve finally moved her! This isn&#x2019;t the same uncaring attitude as before; she replied me. There&#x2019;s hope! Great hope!&#x2019; </span></i></p><p><span style="">I carefully stashed the letter. My passion hadn&#x2019;t seem to reach her yet. &#x2018;</span><i><span style="">I will continue trying to chase her tomorrow. I believe that if I continue to chase her without giving up, I&#x2019;ll get some results.&#x2019;</span></i></p><p><span style="">After school, I found Ma Ke. &#x201C;Why didn&#x2019;t you come to get me this morning?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Ma Ke replied, &#x201C;I was afraid that the after effects of yesterday were too severe, and that you hadn&#x2019;t fully recovered. Judging from your appearance, it seems that you are fine already.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">I happily said, &#x201C;Of course I am fine! My current magic power recovery speed is very fast. Let&#x2019;s go and quickly grab some food! I&#x2019;m starving!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">After we walked into the canteen with our arms around each other&#x2019;s shoulders, I showed my White Rice Bucket characteristic and crazily gobbled up my food. Suddenly, an attractive scent floated over as Hai Shui sat at the same table as us.</span></p><p><span style="">She asked, &#x201C;Zhang Gong, how are you? How are your injuries recovering?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">I smiled as I replied. &#x201C;I really have to thank you for this. If you hadn&#x2019;t helped me treat my wounds yesterday, I might not have been able to get out of bed today.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Hai Shui said, &#x201C;As long as you&#x2019;re fine, it&#x2019;s enough!&#x201D; After saying that, she seemed to have felt something, and her small, fair and delicate face reddened. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">Ma Ke teased her. &#x201C;Why is your face so red?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Hai Shui glared at him and pouted playfully, &#x201C;It wouldn&#x2019;t do if he was injured.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">I hurriedly intercepted. &#x201C;Hai Shui, how is Feng Liang? He shouldn&#x2019;t still be in a dangerous condition, right? </span></p><p><span style="">Hai Shui frowned. &#x201C;He is alright. He&#x2019;ll survive and has already woken up. However, it&#x2019;ll take a long time for him to fully recover. Your moves were truly ferocious.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">I sighed, &#x201C;I didn&#x2019;t have any other choices at that moment. You should&#x2019;ve seen the match. The magic spell he used was too unusual. It seemed to be dark magic. If I hadn&#x2019;t fought with all my might, you probably wouldn&#x2019;t be able to see me today.&#x201D; &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">Hai Shui giggled and replied, &#x201C;Feng Liang not only didn&#x2019;t blame you, but wanted to thank you for what you did yesterday. If you hadn&#x2019;t treated him immediately, he would have died already. Although it is an impartial competition, the results will be undesirable if someone really loses his life in the academy. Furthermore, he has the powerful Ri family supporting him! That&#x2019;s right! About the Ri family, you should keep an eye out for them. You never know when they will get their revenge. Yesterday, after Feng Liang&#x2019;s grandfather, an esteemed elder of the Ri family, Si Feng Ri, found out that you severely injured Feng Liang, he was raged in anger. If you hadn&#x2019;t been in the academy, he would&#x2019;ve already come to get his revenge. That stubborn old man will do anything to maintain the prestige of his family. For now, you should try and keep a low profile. He should calm down after Feng Liang recovers.&#x201D; &#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">I smilingly said, &#x201C;Thank you for telling me this; but so what if the Ri family wants to take their revenge? Are they just going to justify it with their nobility? Feng Liang and I were fighting in an impartial competition. I really want to see what they&#x2019;ll do to me!&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Hai Shui hastily said after hearing my words, &#x201C;Lower your voice! It&#x2019;ll be terrible if someone else heard what you said. It can&#x2019;t be that you don&#x2019;t know that the whole kingdom will be in a civil war soon? Currently, the Emperor is on his last breaths. Once he stops breathing, the civil war will begin. Furthermore, the three main families holds lots of powers in the kingdom.&#x201D;</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p>
