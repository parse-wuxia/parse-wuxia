<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><b>Volume 10: Chapter&#xA0;13 - The Prince Returns Home</b></span></p><p><span style="">The four warriors surrounded me before simultaneously bowing. The leader of the warriors said, &#x201C;Thank you for saving our Miss. Please accept this bow from us brothers.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">I gently waved Sukrad&#x2019;s staff, that was covered with some cloth, as I replied smiling, &#x201C;Friends, no need to be so courteous.&#x201D; A faint light was emitted from the cloth that forcefully lifted them from their bowed position. The leader asked in awe, &#x201C;May I ask which division in the Kingdom of Aixia you&#x2019;re in? With your magic, you should be a Magister.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Without waiting for a reply, the girl said, &#x201C;I&#x2019;m </span><span style="">Ling Ling Xin. Who are you and can you let me see your face?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">I shook my head. &#x201C;That won&#x2019;t be necessary. We met by accident so why should we know each other&#x2019;s identity? Let us meet again in the future.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Ling Ling Xin suddenly appeared before me, extending her hand to remove my conical hat. The few warriors shouted in unison, &#x201C;Don&#x2019;t do that Miss!&#x201D; But how could the willful Miss listen? She stubbornly charged towards me. It seemed that she didn&#x2019;t learn from her mistake and didn&#x2019;t know the immensity of heaven and earth. An invisible, transparent boundary appeared in front of me. &#x2018;</span><i><span style="">Peng!</span></i><span style="">&#x2019; &#xA0;</span><span style="">Ling Ling Xin collided with the boundary and fell to the ground.</span></p><p><span style="">I laughed and said, &#x201C;Is that any way to treat your benefactor? I&#x2019;ll show you my appearance since you want to see it.&#x201D; As I said, I expanded the boundary, leaving out the four warriors, who thought I was going to hurt their miss.</span></p><p><span style="">Ling Ling Xin&#x2019;s previous fall wasn&#x2019;t light, it took her a lot of effort to sit up and rub her the injured areas.</span></p><p><span style="">I moved in front of her and asked, &#x201C;Didn&#x2019;t you want to see my appearance? Look carefully then.&#x201D; Upon saying that, I lifted one side of the muslin in her direction. A mournful screech sounded from her mouth that coupled with my laughter, gave the situation a sinister atmosphere.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Everyone, your Miss has just experienced a slight shock so take care of her. I&#x2019;ll be leaving.&#x201D; How could I not punish this crafty and unruly girl a little?</span></p><p><span style="">With a flash of light, I disappeared from everyone&#x2019;s sight.</span></p><p><span style="">Ling Xin Xin said to herself, &#x201C;He...He was really ugly.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The leader of the warriors sighed. &#x201C;The person that saved you is an extremely powerful mage. We aren&#x2019;t his match even if we were to team up against him. Miss, let&#x2019;s head back quickly.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Lin Xin Xin nodded, with unfocused eyes, before following the warriors.</span></p><p><span style="">My heart felt a little uneasy as I hid in a corner. Had I overdone it in scaring the girl into such a state?</span></p><p><span style="">I no longer felt like strolling after this matter, so I turned around and headed back to the manor.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x3000;&#x3000;&#x2026;&#x2026;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Zhang Gong, where did you go? I was looking for you.&#x201D; Once I stepped inside the Prince&#x2019;s manor, Big Brother Shan Yun came to see me.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;You were looking for me? What for?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;For business of course. Father has already declared that my eldest brother and I will be in charge of the Allied Cavalry. He has already returned to His Majesty to discuss what we talked about that day.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">I took down the conical hat and replied smiling, &#x201C;Uncle really is a impetuous person. I feel real bad in making that old man work.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Shan Yun sighed. &#x201C;Actually, even though my father didn&#x2019;t mention it, I know that that old man wants to reconcile. The real warmongers are few in number. Who doesn&#x2019;t want to live in peace? I&#x2019;ve heard that your wounds aren&#x2019;t fully recovered. I&#x2019;ll help you find some doctors to see if they can cure your wounds.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Thank you Big Brother Shan Yun. However, it&#x2019;s unnecessary as Big Brother Xiu Si&#x2019;s Sky God&#x2019;s horn couldn&#x2019;t cure my wound. I doubt any average doctor would be able to cure it. I appreciate your good intentions, but I really don&#x2019;t want to experience any more major disappointments after becoming hopeful again.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Shan Yun replied, &#x201C;Alright then. The rest have gone to rest up. You couldn&#x2019;t have eaten breakfast yet and I also haven&apos;t, so how about us brothers find a place to eat?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">I asked, puzzled, &#x201C;Don&#x2019;t you need to work today? How do you have time to accompany me?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Shan Yun said, smiling, &#x201C;It&#x2019;s unknown why the allied Demon and Beast race retreated 15 Km. Currently, there&#x2019;s eldest brother to keep watch at the frontlines so naturally, I can relax.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">As Shan Yun and I enjoyed our meal, I asked, &#x201C;Big Brother Shan Yun, if your Kingdom of Xiuda agrees to participate in the negotiation, what do you think our next step should be?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Shan Yun glanced at me from the side before replying with a smile, &#x201C;Brother, are you testing me? Seeing your behaviour, it seems that you should have a card up your sleeve.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Embarrassed, I scratched my head. &#x201C;Even though I&#x2019;ve got some thoughts on this, I want to hear your opinion first.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Shan Yun replied, &#x201C;If His Majesty really agrees to negotiate, the next step we should take is to convince the other two kingdoms. It&#x2019;ll be extremely easy to convince the Kingdom of Dalu. You should also know that there&#x2019;s another official name for Dalu.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">I nodded and my eyes lit up as Shan Yun and I said simultaneously, &#x201C;The Peace Kingdom.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Shan Yun replied, &#x201C;Since they are a peaceful country, they shouldn&#x2019;t like fighting. They&#x2019;ll definitely stand on our side as long as we mediate. In that case, it&#x2019;ll be easier to convince Aixia, but there&#x2019;s something that you must settle as soon as possible.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">I queried, &#x201C;What&#x2019;s the matter?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Shan Yun&#x2019;s expression changed as he said, &#x201C;That is to immediately confirm the attitude of the allied Demon and Beast race forces. As the proverb says, there are times where orders, excluding their ruler&#x2019;s, won&#x2019;t be accepted. If the allied army of the Demon and Beast race don&#x2019;t listen to the Princess and insist on attacking the </span><span style="">Str&#xF6;m Fortress, what will you do then? Won&#x2019;t everything be in ruin? Thus, before my father returns with the news, you must let Mu Zi to stabilize them. It&#x2019;s best if we&#x2019;re able to confirm their views s before the peace talks.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">I had really neglected this matter and what Shan Yun said was logical. If the allied army of the Demon and Beast races didn&#x2019;t listen to their orders to move, what would I do then?</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Big Brother Shan Yun, what you&#x2019;ve said is right. We&#x2019;ll head there tomorrow since it&#x2019;s better to settle this matter as soon as possible.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Shan Yun nodded. &#x201C;After dinner, I&#x2019;ll bring you to the Eastern entrance, at that time I could make an excuse to do a patrol to bring you out. You must head back as quickly as you can, as I don&#x2019;t want what repeat of what previously happened with you killing your way back in.</span></p><p><span style="">After quickly finishing our meal, I dashed to Ke Lun Duo&#x2019;s room. That fellow was in a deep slumber as he didn&#x2019;t notice me, even after walking to his side. How was he an expert?</span></p><p><span style="">I gathered a water bullet and instantly shot his face. This was the most efficient way to wake someone up, as I had learned from experiences with my mother.</span></p><p><span style="">Ke Lun Duo became alert and jumped down from his bed.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;It&#x2019;s raining! It can&#x2019;t be! How could there be rain in the room?</span><i><span style=""> Ah!</span></i><span style=""> Zhang Gong, why are you here?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">I suppressed my laughter and replied, &#x201C;It&#x2019;s to wake you up, lazy bum, to discuss some business.&#x201D;</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p>
