<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>Volume 4: Chapter 40 - Hai Ri&apos;s Anger</strong></span></p><p><span style="">Hai Ri suddenly had a realization and said, &#x201C;So, it was you brat! I heard from Hai Shui that you came back. I had planned to look for you tomorrow. You don&#x2019;t know just how hell bent my sister has fallen for you. She keeps talking to me about you. You&#x2019;re so capable! You just got back, but you already have your hands on her.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">I laughed bitterly in my heart as I knew he had misunderstood. I hastily explained, &#x2018;It&#x2019;s not&#x2026;&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Hai Ri interrupted saying, &#x201C;Why isn&#x2019;t that the case? I have already seen it. You still want to make excuses? Haha, don&#x2019;t worry! I would mind if it was other people courting her, but I don&#x2019;t mind if it&#x2019;s you. You&#x2019;re suitable for my sister.&#x201D; He showed an elder brother&#x2019;s look.</span></p><p><span style="">When I tried to explain to him again, Hai Shui stepped forward from behind me. She dully said, &#x201C;Brother, please don&#x2019;t meddle in our matter. There really is nothing happening between us.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Hai Ri smiled and said, &#x201C;You&#x2019;re still saying nothing is going on? I have already seen you two hugging each other. Haha. Hmm, sister, why did you cry? Did he bully you?&#x201D; Hai Ri&#x2019;s expression changed instantly after seeing tears on Hai Shui&#x2019;s face.</span></p><p><span style="">Hai Shui quickly replied, &#x201C;Brother, he didn&#x2019;t bully me. I already told you not to interfere with our matters. There&#x2019;s really nothing going on between Zhang Gong and I. He already has a girlfriend.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What? Zhang Gong, you&#x2019;re really good. You actually dare to bully my sister. I won&#x2019;t forgive you!&#x201D; Hai Ri&#x2019;s temper erupted again. </span></p><p><span style="">Hai Shui stood in front of me and cried out, &#x201C;Brother, please stop meddling in our matter! You also can&#x2019;t blame Zhang Gong in this matter.&#x201D; &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">Hai Ri said in rage, &#x201C;If I don&#x2019;t blame him, don&#x2019;t tell me that I should be the one to be blamed! Hai Shui, get out of my way! Zhang Gong, you stinking brat, if you&#x2019;re a man, stop hiding behind my sister and fight with me. Since we were young, I&#x2019;ve only fought you once. We haven&#x2019;t fought since then. I really want to see just what you have that gives you the guts to bully my sister.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">I used short distance teleportation to move in front of Hai Shui from behind her. I could only let Hai Ri let off some steam. At worst, I just won&#x2019;t retaliate.</span></p><p><span style="">Once Hai Ri saw me step out, he didn&#x2019;t say anything, but chanted. &#x201C;</span><i><span style="">Boundless flames, please burn like my fighting spirit to turn into a violent flame to incinerate the enemy standing before you!&#x201D; </span></i><span style="">An enormous violent flame shot towards me.</span></p><p><span style="">When Hai Shui wanted to stop the attack, I mentally told her, &#x201C;Your brother can&#x2019;t hurt me. Let him let out some steam! If not, he won&#x2019;t be able to calm down.&#x201D; After hearing what I said, she moved to the side and worriedly watched our battle.</span></p><p><span style="">I cast a Holy light on myself; mellow and rich light elements protected me. Hai Ri&#x2019;s &#xA0;magic power was so overbearing as I was forced to fly backwards after coming in contact with the violent flames. </span></p><p><span style="">I was like a magic sandbag after that, as I was continuously hit by all kinds of fire magic from Hai Ri. I stayed in the area of my defensive spell and unceasingly chanting defensive spells. The sky was dyed red by Hai Ri&#x2019;s fire magic. </span></p><p><span style="">I cried out in my heart. Hai Ri is really strong. After fighting me for a long time, he was just as violent as he was initially; without any intention of stopping. </span></p><p><span style="">Hai Shui wanted to help me a couple of times, but I kept on stopping her. I told her that I could still hold on.</span></p><p><span style="">The people watching our battle from the surroundings gradually increased. They were really fellows that had nothing to do after eating one&#x2019;s fill. They pointed and discussed among themselves.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;</span><i><span style="">Wah</span></i><span style="">! Who made Boss Hai Ri so mad? The one getting beaten doesn&#x2019;t have any strength to fight back.&#x201D; As I was bombarded by countless magic spells, I couldn&#x2019;t see who it was.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;That fella is in deep trouble. He might become a roasted pig after the battle.&#x201D; &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;He really can hold on. Who is that? His defense is quite good. Hai Shui is also here. He&#x2019;s probably someone that was reckless enough to try and court her, which made Hai Ri furious.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">As I stayed in my defensive spell, I withstood his attack. Even though Hai Ri was strong, he was still a rank lower than me. His attack wouldn&#x2019;t be able to break my defense. The problem was that there was no end to his attacks and I also couldn&#x2019;t fight back. This was really troublesome. </span></p><p><span style="">Just as I was dreading, a violent gale suddenly blew past me. A few small Wind Tornados appeared in front of me. My body suddenly lightened. The pressure on my body caused by Hai Ri instantaneously disappeared.</span></p><p><span style="">Mu Zi landed in front of me accompanied with a cool breeze. &#x201C;Mu Zi, why did you come?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Mu Zi snorted and said, &#x201C;You didn&#x2019;t come to the canteen even after a long time had passed. I&#x2019;m worried for you.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">I moved my head in front of her ear and said as I laughed, &#x201C;Were you afraid that I would be attracted to Hai Shui?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Mu Zi laughed and said, &#x201C;Stop being so shameless! Hai Ri, why are you fighting Zhang Gong?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Hai Ri saw Mu Zi appear and block his attack. He stopped attacking and said, &#x201C;Mu Zi, why are you here? This matter only involves Zhang Gong and I, so stop meddling in our affair and get out of the way!&#x201D; Hai Ri looked a little scared after seeing Mu Zi.</span></p><p><span style="">Mu Zi replied, &#x201C;You&#x2019;re shameless. Zhang Gong didn&#x2019;t fight back and let you attack him, but you kept on attacking him.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Hai Ri coldly said, &#x201C;He&#x2019;s guilty since he bullied my sister, so I want to beat him up.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Mu Zi said, &#x201C;How did he bully your sister? Did you see it happening?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Hai Ri was instantly speechless and yelled at the surrounding students who were whispering, &#x201C;You all aren&#x2019;t involved in this, so stop staying here to watch the show.&#x201D; After he chased away the crowd, he turned to Hai Shui and asked, &#x201C;Sister, did he bully you just now?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Once Hai Shui saw Mu Zi came, her expressions darkened. When she heard Hai Ri questioning her, she replied, &#x201C;Brother, I already told you not to interfere with our matters. Zhang Gong really didn&#x2019;t bully me. Let&#x2019;s just go!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">After Hai Ri heard what she said, he was stunned. &#x201C;If he didn&#x2019;t bully you, then why were you crying just now?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Hai Shui&#x2019;s tears flowed again. She said as she cried, &#x201C;You don&#x2019;t need to care!&#x201D; She turned and ran away.</span></p><p><span style="">After Hai Ri saw Hai Shui running away, he said to Mu Zi, &#x201C;Are you still going to say he didn&#x2019;t bully her? You already saw how upset she was.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">I walked out from behind Mu Zi and patted Hai Ri&#x2019;s shoulder. Hai Ri shoved my hand away from him. &#x201C;Don&#x2019;t touch me! If you don&#x2019;t give me a reasonable explanation, I won&#x2019;t ever let this matter go!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">I bitterly smiled and said, &#x201C;Brother Hai Ri, please calm down a little and let me explain.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Hai Ri coldly looked at me and said, &#x201C;Carry on.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">I looked at Mu Zi and she nodded at me. I sighed before telling him everything from the start to the end of what happened.</span></p><p><span style="">After Hai Ri heard what I said, he stunningly said, &#x201C;So, it was a love triangle.&#x201D; He pulled me to the side and whispered to me, &#x201C;Brother, it was my bad previously, but it was your fault! Why did you choose Mu Zi? She&#x2019;s so fierce and violent. It would have been better if you had fallen for my sister as she is prettier and gentler. You should have chosen her instead.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">I helplessly replied, &#x201C;You can&#x2019;t make such comparisons in love relationships. I can only apologize to Hai Shui. Mu Zi and I mutually love each other. Brother Hai Ri, can you stop making things difficult for me?&#x201D;</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p>
