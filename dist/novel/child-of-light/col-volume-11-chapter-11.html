<p><b><u>Volume 11: Chapter 11 - Monster Traces Suddenly Appear</u></b></p><p><span style="">Ke Er Lan Di was stunned. &#x201C;What&#x2019;s wrong? It can&#x2019;t be</span><span style="">&#x2014;</span><span style="">there&#x2019;s nothing wrong here.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">My bad premonition was growing; there was a sinister chill coming from nearby. I waved my hand, casting a low grade water spell to put out the fire at the camp. I grabbed Sukrad&#x2019;s staff and stood up as I could clearly feel the Monster race&#x2019;s aura. I knew the demonic aura so well that I couldn&#x2019;t be more familiar with them. Why had they appeared here?</span></p><p><span style="">Ke Er Lan Di stood with me, but he seemed to be unable to discover anything amiss. He frowned. &#x201C;Eighteen, are you serious? Why can&#x2019;t I feel anything then?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">I whispered, &#x201C;Quickly, get everyone up. Our surroundings are filled with a terrifying power. We must be prepared.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Ke Er Lan Di nodded. He was a well trained soldier with a lot of experience after all. He was good at adapting to sudden situations. His subordinates were really remarkable as they had already gathered without making a single sound.</span></p><p><span style="">The sinister aura in the sky thickened. Ke Er Lan Di also felt something was wrong at this moment. &#x201C;What&#x2019;s that? It looks sinister.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">I said seriously, &#x201C;If I haven&#x2019;t guessed wrong, it should be the Monster race.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Monster Race? Ke Er Lan Di cried out, &#x201C;There&#x2019;s really a Monster race?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">I looked at him and shook my head helplessly. &#x201C;There&#x2019;s a lot of people in the continent that have the same mindset as you do. I can tell you now that they really exist as I&#x2019;ve fought against them. You shouldn&#x2019;t ask anything for the moment as we should deal with the situation at hand. Everyone follow me to see what&#x2019;s happening.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Upon saying that, I used my senses to walk deep into the forest.</span></p><p><span style="">It was easy to differentiate the Monster race&#x2019;s deathly aura. I just moved towards where the aura was at its thickest. This should find them. Ke Er Lan Di brought his 18 subordinates to follow me closely, without making a single sound. </span></p><p><span style="">The deathly aura was getting increasingly thick. It was so thick that it emitted a strong pressure.</span></p><p><span style="">Finally, when we walked into the depths of the forest, I found the source of the deathly aura. It was a clearing within the forest. The clearing didn&#x2019;t have any trace of life. The grey land meant that they weren&#x2019;t any creatures, and the grass in the surroundings showed signs of withering. There was a pit about 16 metres wide at the center of the clearing. It was impossible to see what was in it from our viewpoint. Faint red light &#xA0;came out from that hole, giving it an exceptionally sinister feeling.</span></p><p><span style="">Ke Er Lan Di said, &#x201C;Is this the den of the Monster race?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">I nodded slightly. &#x201C;It&#x2019;s very possible. Let&#x2019;s just wait and see.&#x201D; This hole was much smaller than the one beside our base that Big Brother Zhang Hu and the rest of us had eliminated. There weren&#x2019;t any monsters appearing, but I was certain that this was another sinister spawning ground for the Monster race. I had to kill them while they were spawning. Otherwise, it would bring an unknown number of losses.</span></p><p><span style="">The sky was still as gloomy. The centre of the sinister looking clouds was above this hole.</span></p><p><span style="">Rustling sounds could be heard from the hole. I hastily gave a &#x2018;Be careful&#x2019; eye signal towards Ke Er Lan Di as I no longer tried to keep my identity a secret. I stealthily took out Sukrad&#x2019;s staff from the cloth. I activated the fusion power in my body to sustain my peak state. While I was preparing, the rustling sound got stronger. </span></p><p><i><span style="">&#x2018;Rustle! Rustle!&#x2019;</span></i><span style=""> Ten black figures shot out from the hole and landed on the ground. I had seen those disgusting and horrifying monsters before. They seemed to sense a human&#x2019;s aura as their glimmering red eyes shot in our direction.</span></p><p><span style="">I whispered, &#x201C;Everyone, take care of yourself.&#x201D; I definitely wouldn&#x2019;t show mercy to that sinister race. After confirming my thoughts, I decided to annihilate them at lightning speed.</span></p><p><span style="">After activating my body&#x2019;s powers, I didn&#x2019;t care about Ke Er Lan Di&#x2019;s surprised gaze and leapt out. The Sukrad&#x2019;s staff brought a white light with it. A 10m white light ray shot towards the monsters in front of us.</span></p><p><span style="">After a loud explosion, a few of the monsters were instantly annihilated from being engulfed with the light element&#x2019;s purifying power, like a spring wind that swept past. However, I didn&#x2019;t relax as more monsters were rapidly flowing out of the hole.</span></p><p><i><span style="">&#x201C;Light elements! My great friends, I plead to you to use your power to form limitless light rays to form light stars and to eliminate the enemies before you.</span></i><i><span style="">&#x2014;</span></i><i><span style="">Bright Star&#x2019;s Shine!&#x201D;</span></i></p><p><span style="">Light elements rapidly gathered by my side and constantly forming light stars, creating layer after layer. I chanted to bring forth the maximum power of this magic spell.</span></p><p><span style="">My body floated as I retreated into the forest. Numerous light stars burst forth at my command. The intense light made Ke Er Lan Di, the rest of his subordinates and I to lose our sight. I clearly felt the monsters that were surging out from the hole were vaporized from my attack, including some of the monsters that were still in the hole.</span></p><p><span style="">When the light dimmed, the clearing was already filled with thousands of holes and green fluid was everywhere. I didn&#x2019;t know how many monsters had died. The entire clearing formed a gigantic hole. Waves of sickening odor wafted towards us, making me frown.</span></p><p><span style="">Ke Er Lun Duo looked stunned at what happened and muttered, &#x201C;This...What magic is this to have such might? You...You can&#x2019;t just be a Magic Scholar, right?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">I said seriously, &#x201C;I&#x2019;m not done yet. Be careful.&#x201D; I started to gather the power from the Holy Sword to completely erase this den.</span></p><p><span style="">There were suddenly mournful shrieks from the den as a couple of red lights dashed towards us. I brandished Sukarad&#x2019;s staff horizontally to cast a light screen to use it as a barrier that would block the monsters that were coming out. With a flash of light, they were eliminated by my light elements.</span></p><p><span style="">The monsters that were currently emerging were three times as fast as they were before. The offensive power of those monsters was slowly becoming stronger. If it weren&#x2019;t for the steady flow of fusion power in my body, it would really be difficult to deal with them.</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p>
