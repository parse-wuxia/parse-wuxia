<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>Volume 6: Chapter 2 - Teacher&apos;s Summons</strong></span></p><p><span style="">My expression dampened a little but I forcefully smiled and said, &#x201C;We are doing really well.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Hai Shui didn&#x2019;t notice my expression and plainly replied, &#x201C;That&#x2019;s great. We are going on a vacation soon. What are your plans?&#x201D;</span></p><p><i><span style="">&#x2018;Plans? I really haven&#x2019;t thought about that.&#x2019;</span></i></p><p><span style="">I replied without thinking, &#x201C;I still don&#x2019;t know. I&#x2019;ll make my plans when the vacation starts. Maybe, I will just head home.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Hai Shui nodded and replied, &#x201C;That&#x2019;s a good plan. I heard from my elder sister that your magic power had already reached the Magister&#x2019;s stage. Is that really true?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">I couldn&#x2019;t, and also didn&#x2019;t want to lie to her so I just simply replied, &#x201C;That&#x2019;s correct and it had already been sometime since I reached that stage. From the undulation of your magic power from your body, it seemed that you have not improved much. You must work hard.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">After I said that sentence, I regretted it. As expected, after Hai Shui heard my words, her expression dampened. She plainly replied, &#x201C;My heart is placed somewhere else so I can&#x2019;t focus.&#x201D; After she said that, she looked deeply at me.</span></p><p><span style="">My heart jumped heavily. I clearly understood Hai Shui&#x2019;s strong feelings for me, but I had already given my entire heart to Mu Zi. At one side, it was the one I love and on the other is someone that loved me. Both sides had similarly put me in a spot.</span></p><p><span style="">I coughed and changed the topic. &#x201C;Have you eaten?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Hai Shui shook her head and replied, &#x201C;I haven&#x2019;t. I am just planning to go and eat. I coincidentally saw you so I came over.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">I repressed a caring expression and replied, &#x201C;You should eat more. You have lost a lot of weight again.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Hai Shui&#x2019;s eyes reddened and suddenly she threw herself at me like a bird seeking refuge in a forest and cried bitterly.</span></p><p><span style="">Her action gave me a shock, but I couldn&#x2019;t push her away. I stood there at a loss to know what to do and let her tears wet my clothes.</span></p><p><span style="">After a long time, Hai Shui then released her hands that that were tightly holding my hands. She just stood a few centimeters away. Her breath gently blow on my face, making me a little intoxicated by it.</span></p><p><span style="">Hai Shui&#x2019;s beautiful large eyes were filled with tears. She whispered, &#x201C;Can&#x2019;t you give a little of your feelings to me? Even if it is just pity, can&#x2019;t you?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">I looked at Hai Shui in a stunned state and really didn&#x2019;t know how to reply.</span></p><p><span style="">Hai Shui sighed lightly and placed a kiss on my lips that felt like like a dragonfly stepping on water before she turned around and ran away.</span></p><p><span style="">As I watched her delicate back gradually vanish from my view, my mood became much heavier. I was in a little peculiar mood as I told myself, </span><i><span style="">&#x2018;It wasn&#x2019;t that I completely didn&#x2019;t have any feelings for Hai Shui. However, when the heart ripples, it would be extremely hard to stop it from expanding.&#x2019;</span></i></p><p><span style="">I bitterly laughed and rubbed the remaining sensation that Hai Shui left on my lips and didn&#x2019;t know what to do.</span></p><p><i><span style="">&#x2018;This is really like when a wave had not even eased before another wave had come. I haven&#x2019;t even solved the matter with Mu Zi and now Hai Shui came in rapidly. What am I supposed to do?&#x2019;</span></i></p><p><span style="">I didn&#x2019;t go to Ascending Jade Tide and just ate some food in the canteen before returning back to the dormitory by myself.</span></p><p><span style="">After the next few days, I didn&#x2019;t said anything to Mu Zi. I just sat by her side and stared fixedly at her daily. In my heart, I thought,</span><i><span style=""> &#x2018;Why can&#x2019;t you really accept me?&#x201D;</span></i></p><p><span style="">Mu Zi didn&#x2019;t dare look at my gaze which was filled with deep feelings for her. I could see that she was avoiding me.</span></p><p><span style="">Ma Ke suddenly came to find me today. After seeing me, he smiled and said, &#x201C;Boss, how have you been recently?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">I snappily replied, &#x201C;How can I be like you so comfortably off? From day to night, you are stuck to Hai Yue and ignored me as your brother. This is a perfect example of paying more attention to a lover than friends. From what I see, it seems that you have already forgotten about me.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Ma Ke embarrassedly laughed. &#x201C;How can I? I can forget anyone but I won&#x2019;t be able to forget about you, Boss. Didn&#x2019;t I come to look for you just now?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">I snorted coldly and replied, &#x201C;Just say it, why have you come? Without any urgent matter, I doubt you will come looking for me.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Ma Ke smiled apologetically and replied, &#x201C;Hehe, Boss, it seems you have completely looked through me. It is Teacher Di that told me to look for you. On my way home yesterday, I met that old man. Teacher Di wants you to see him after the end of lessons today.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Why was Teacher Di looking for me? I replied, &#x201C;I got it. Do you still have other matters you want to tell me?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Ma Ke shook his head. &#x201C;I don&#x2019;t have any others except this. It is that Hai Yue told me to tell you that you aren&#x2019;t allowed to bully her sister. Aiyo! Boss, stop hitting me!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">As I continued to knock his head, I angrily said, &#x201C;If I don&#x2019;t hit you, who should I hit? This matter is a pot that you can&#x2019;t open and you just lifted the lid of that pot. You are just asking to be beaten.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Ma Ke turned and ran away. As he ran, he replied, &#x201C;I don&#x2019;t want to continue arguing with you anymore. Anyways, I have already told you. Don&#x2019;t forget to head over to Teacher Di&#x2019;s place.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">I impatiently replied, &#x201C;I got it already. You just have to quickly head back to Hai Yue.&#x201D; After this brat got Hai Yue, he had completely changed. He seemed to become like the wind.</span></p><p><span style="">After school, I went to the Royal Intermediate Magic Academy by myself.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Zhang Gong, you&#x2019;re here.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Teacher Di, I heard from Ma Ke that you are looking for me.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Teacher Di laughed. &#x201C;That&#x2019;s correct. If I don&#x2019;t find you, will you come to find me?&#x201D; &#x2018;</span><i><span style="">Why did his speech seemed to be similar to what I said to Ma Ke?&#x2019;</span></i></p><p><span style="">I chuckled. &#x201C;This is to say that this old man missed me.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Teacher Di rebuked, &#x201C;What old man? Am I really that old, and who is missing you? I wanted to find you for some important matter.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">I hastily smiled apologetically, &#x201C;Yes! Yes! Yes! How can you be old? You are at the prime of your life and are an unrivalled hero. Hehe.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">After hearing my two sentences of flattery, Teacher Di&#x2019;s expression softened. &#x201C;You brat, you only know how to speak glibly. Is there any improvement in &#xA0;your magic power recently?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">I replied, &#x201C;I definitely have improved! Why don&#x2019;t you try it out?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Teacher Di curled his lip. &#x201C;Why should I try? Your power already isn&#x2019;t worse than mine. I still want to keep my old bones to continue living for a couple more years.&#x201D; I helplessly sniggered, &#x2018;</span><i><span style="">Why did I call him old? Now, he is calling himself old bones.&#x2019;</span></i></p><p><span style="">I respectfully replied, &#x201C;What is your purpose in finding me?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Teacher Di expression changed. &#x201C;The vacation is coming soon. What have you planned for this holiday?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">I replied, &#x201C;I am thinking of heading home to visit my parents.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Teacher Di nodded. &#x201C;That&#x2019;s also good. You have been out for another half year. You should head home to visit them. However, I hope that before you head home, you can settle something first.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">I astonishingly asked, &#x201C;What&#x2019;s the matter? Please tell me.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Teacher Di muttered irresolutely, &#x201C;Child, do you still remember what I told you that year, to bring Xiao Jin to find his home?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">My heart tightened before I nodded. &#x201C;I remember.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Teacher Di said, &#x201C;Xiao Jin is the Dragon clan&#x2019;s next generation Dragon King. I want you to use this holiday to bring him home. He also has parents just like you after all. Don&#x2019;t you want to let them, parents and child reunite?&#x201D;</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p>
