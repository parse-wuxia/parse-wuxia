<p><strong><u>Volume 2: Chapter 31 &#x2013; I Have Killed</u></strong></p><p>I jogged back to the dormitory. All of my roommates were out, I suppose all of them went home. I quickly packed my things as I also wanted to return home.</p><p>After I finished packing away my things, I went to a neighboring room. Ma Ke was still there and had almost fully recovered from his injuries.</p><p>Seeing me come in, Ma Ke rose from the bed, &#x201C;Boss, you came back. How&#x2019;s your recovery fairing?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Pretty good, How about you? I&#x2019;m just about to head home.&#x201D;</p><p>Ma Ke extended his arm toward me, &#x201C;No problems, I&#x2019;ve just about recovered. Don&#x2019;t visit me again, I&#x2019;m just about to leave!&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Then let us say our end of term goodbyes. I want to quickly go home, I&#x2019;ve become very homesick.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Wait for me a bit, I still have to pack a bit. Let&#x2019;s leave together.&#x201D;</p><p>Ma Ke packed a few more things and a moment later we head out of the dormitories together.</p><p>&#x201C;Ma Ke, Did Hai Ri come visit?&#x201D; After all, I didn&#x2019;t fulfill my promise with myself, to challenge him once more.</p><p>&#x201C;He visited. He asked about the condition of your injury and said that you were truly ferocious. I reckon even he may not be able to win against you. There will be many chances in the future. There is nothing to really regret. You gave a great show with the match.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Hehe. I&#x2019;ll wait until the next term. There should be many opportunities to challenge Hai Ri then.&#x201D;</p><p>At the academy&#x2019;s entrance, when we were about to go our separate ways, &#x201C;Take care of yourself.&#x201D; I patted his shoulder. Ma Ke&#x2019;s eyes were red.</p><p>&#x201C;Boss, the days we spent together were truly happy. Take care of yourself too. My home is at the capital. I&#x2019;ll see you next term.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;I&#x2019;ll see you then.&#x201D; I turned around and ran as fast as I could. I was afraid that I would be reluctant to leave.</p><p>Not far a distance away, I heard a person call to me, &#x201C;Zhang Gong!&#x201D;</p><p>I turned my head around for a look, and immediately felt very moved, &#x201C;Teacher Xiu, you actually came. I thought you weren&#x2019;t going to pick me up!&#x201D;</p><p>Teacher Xiu was still the same as ever, but there was a trace of emotion on his serious face. &#x201C;How could I not come? Come on, We&#x2019;re heading home.&#x201D;</p><p>Together, Teacher Xiu and I, set foot on the path home.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Teacher Xiu, Have you seen my mother and father lately?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Before I left, I paid a visit to your house. They are doing great, but they really miss you. How are you doing at the academy?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Very good. Did I not place first in the entrance exams? I am at the top of the second year students at the academy!&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Is that right? You are first out of all the second years?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;That&#x2019;s right. I also made a very good friend. His name is Ma Ke.&#x201D; I unleashed an unceasing torrent of words about my time at the academy. We talked happily on the road. Only, I concealed the fact that I used to spell &#x201C;Sharing Life&#x201D; in order to save Xiao Jin. I didn&#x2019;t want Teacher Xiu to worry. I also didn&#x2019;t want let my family to know either. Teacher Xiu knew I became Teacher Di&#x2019;s disciple. With great admiration, he continuously congratulated my great luck. He also repeatedly warned that I must study magic diligently under Teacher Di&#x2019;s tutelage. He also said that Teacher Di was indeed one of the continent&#x2019;s greatest mages. I didn&#x2019;t know how lucky I was.</p><p>We took a short rest. When no people were around, we used teleportation magic to travel onward. Quickly, we traveled about two-thirds of the way through. It was when we reached an unknown forest that a small problem arose.</p><p>About a dozen men scuttled from the middle of the woods, barring our way. They all looked rather burly.</p><p>Teacher Xiu glanced at me and whispered, &#x201C;Zhang Gong, I&#x2019;m going to go and see what the matter is. Wait for me here. When I&#x2019;m done talking, we&#x2019;ll go.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Gentlemen, Is there a problem?&#x201D;</p><p>The burly leader twitched his mouth, &#x201C;There&#x2019;s no problem, it&#x2019;s just that we have a shortage of money when we want to play around with some pretty girls. Seeing you like this, you ought to be mages. I advise you don&#x2019;t resist or else, hehe, us big brothers won&#x2019;t play nice. Obediently come and hand over your coin.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Moneyless Gentlemen, here, I have ten gold coins. Why don&#x2019;t you take this out to go drink and let us pass?&#x201D;</p><p>The burly leader grew angry, &#x201C;Do you think we&#x2019;re beggars? You think this is enough to let you pass? This won&#x2019;t do. Hand over everything!&#x201D; The ten men seemed ready throw themselves at us.</p><p>&#x201C;Alright, alright. Then wait for me, I&#x2019;ll go get it.&#x201D; Teacher Xiu quickly walked to my side and whispered, &#x201C;Zhang Gong, These bandits&#x2019; magic fluctuations aren&#x2019;t strong. Let teacher see the fruits of your efforts.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;What? You want me to fight? Teacher Xiu, I can&#x2019;t. Why don&#x2019;t you?&#x201D; This is the first time I&#x2019;ve come across this kind of situation, I&#x2019;m really scared.</p><p>&#x201C;Out of the question. Magic when used in real combat allows it to improve. I&#x2019;ll be at your side protecting you. Fight fearlessly.&#x201D; Teacher Xiu stopped smiling and raised his face.</p><p>Truly deserving of being called the devil teacher, I knew I&#x2019;d be unable to escape. I could only brace myself and walk over. &#x201C;Gentlemen, Look at us, we also don&#x2019;t have any money. Could you let us off?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Enough rubbish.&#x201D; Saying that was like slapping him, inciting him to come over. From reflex, I could feel a teleportation arriving from five meters away. I immediately cast several defense spells on myself.</p><p>&#x201C;Mage! This child is actually a mage. Everybody come together!&#x201D; The group of ten large men charged toward us.</p><p>What do I do? I&#x2019;ve never experienced real combat before, I felt panicked. Forget it all. I&#x2019;ll just fight! I&#x2019;ll give them a strong spell and it&#x2019;ll be over. I began using instantaneous teleports to change my position, and then I chanted my most powerful attack spell. &#x201C;Oh great light element, please allow me to borrow your formidable strength, let the infinite light of the earth shine.&#x201D; With me at its center, Brilliant Empire let out a blinding, overpowering brilliance.</p><p><em>&#x201C;Wa</em>, using such a powerful spell.&#x201D; From a short distance away, Teacher Xiu immediately teleported out of harm&#x2019;s way.</p><p>Because there wasn&#x2019;t a protective barrier, Brilliant Empire was able to fully display itself. Anything within a two hundred meter radius were entirely enveloped by the dazzling rays of light. The ten large men within my powerful spell had already turned to ashes. I only saw when the spell had him them, they were entirely engulfed by it. They turned into tiny specks of ashes; Afterwards, you wouldn&#x2019;t be able to completely find them.</p><p>I blankly withdrew my magic power. At this moment, Teacher Xiu had already returned. &#x201C;Zhang Gong, your magic is formidable. What was that spell you had just used? It gave me a fright. Why would you use such a strong spell to handle such small vermin? Using your strengthened light arrows would have been enough.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;I was really scared. I couldn&#x2019;t help but use Brilliant Empire. That was the most powerful spell I could cast. Teacher Xiu, where did they go?&#x201D; I was complete unaware that I had already killed them.</p><p>&#x201C;They&#x2026; They turned to ashes. Did you think this was the academy? Those men were all only advanced mages.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;What? I killed them?&#x201D; I suddenly wore a blank stare.</p><p>&#x201C;Let it pass. In any case they were only villains.&#x201D; Teacher Xiu consoled me. I killed but it doesn&#x2019;t matter. First of all, they were only bandits. Secondly, I was still a child. Lastly, the most important point, was that I was an outstanding student at the intermediate royal magic academy. I was a pillar of the nation. I definitely had some privileges. Furthermore, how could anyone else know that I&#x2019;ve already killed people?&#xA0;Hehe<a href="4.bp.blogspot.com">.</a></p><p></p><hr><p></p>
