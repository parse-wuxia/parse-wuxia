<p><strong><u>Volume 2: Chapter 8 &#x2013; First Class</u></strong></p><p>&#x201C;Students, starting from today, our class will have two new students.This is this year&#x2019;s entrance exam&#x2019;s top ranker, Zhang Gong Wei and this is Ma Ke Sai. Let us welcome their arrival.&#x201D; The classroom resounded with applause.</p><p>Today at dawn, the education department&#x2019;s teacher assigned me to this second grade&#x2019;s A class. I didn&#x2019;t expect that Ma Ke was also assigned to the second grade, as well as the same class as me. From yesterday, I recognize Boss&#x2019;s green hair. He&#x2019;s also in this class. In the future, it seems that I will experience hardships.</p><p>As I was continually contemplating, I basically didn&#x2019;t hear anything of what the teacher said and soon class was over. After finishing class, the teacher told me and Ma Ke about the academy&#x2019;s educational system. In the afternoon is self-practice. Both the students and teachers are surprisingly flexible. The students can follow their own preferences in how they practice. If they don&#x2019;t understand something, then they can ask the teachers or go to the library and consult some books. This is completely different from my expectations of strict, cut-throat students and teachers.</p><p>&#x201C;Boss, where is your dorm room? I&#x2019;m in room 209.&#x201D; As soon as we exited through the door, Ma Ke began chatting with me.</p><p>&#x201C;I&#x2019;m in room 208, so we&#x2019;re neighbors. Do the students in your room bully you?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;No way. They&#x2019;re all busy with magic practice and meditation. They don&#x2019;t even notice me. Boss, are you still mad about last time?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;How could I be so petty? I already punished you during the exam. Even if it&#x2019;s in the past now, in the future, be careful when you speak!&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Okay, okay.&#x201D;</p><p>Right at that moment, an uninvited guest came. &#x201C;Little brother, come over here and help me with my daily duties.&#x201D; It&#x2019;s the green-haired Boss!</p><p>&#x201C;Who are you to dare speak to my boss that way!?&#x201D; Unexpectedly, Ma Ke is quite fierce.</p><p>&#x201C;Then who are you? Are you already done with life? He is my newly accepted little brother from yesterday. I let him help me with a small matter, so what?&#x201D; Green-hair spit to the side as he said this.</p><p>&#x201D;What, you dare to treat my boss like your little brother!? Then wouldn&#x2019;t I be the little brother&#x2019;s little brother? Unacceptable, I challenge you to a duel.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Who&#x2019;s afraid of who? If you have the ability, then come. Don&#x2019;t tell me you&#x2019;re just a simple freshman with nothing extraordinary about him.&#x201D; During their dialog, I had a feeling that Green Hair is quite strict. He probably wouldn&#x2019;t&#x2026;.</p><p>&#x201C;Fire elements, listen to my command, condense into a fireball and annihilate my enemies!&#x201D; Because they didn&#x2019;t know each other&#x2019;s strength, Ma Ke first cast a small magic to test the opponent&#x2019;s strength.</p><p>&#x201C;Don&#x2019;t! It&#x2019;s my fault. Please forgive me. My father is the prime minister. Read about my father in the newspapers (three hundred words have been omitted here).&#x201D; No way. Me and Ma Ke glanced at each other. It turns out that he really is an oaf. Recalling how this oaf deceived me yesterday, I need to release some stress. Immediately, I signaled Ma Ke with a glance then we yelled: &#x201C;Flatten him!&#x201D; We don&#x2019;t need magic (In fear of beating him to death). At once, we began conducted a beating education for Green Hair.</p><p>&#x201C;Green haired bedbug, how come it&#x2019;s you again? You are truly the greatest loss of face for this academy. Why are you two lowering yourselves to this bedbug&#x2019;s level?&#x201D; This last sentence was directed at us. The former is a second grade student (On the school uniform there is a mark to differentiate between grades) with thick black hair. Although he is only around 10 years old, his face has a steadfast expression. It seems like I&#x2019;ve seen him before today. I think he is a student in our class.</p><p>&#x201C;Hello, it&#x2019;s like this&#x2026;.&#x201D; After hearing my description of the events, the black haired youngster can&#x2019;t help but laugh heartily.</p><p>&#x201C;So you two are those two new students. The green haired bedbug is one of the highlights of our academy. He is trash that doesn&#x2019;t know anything at all. He was only able get accepted into the academy by using his father&#x2019;s reputation granted by His Majesty.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Hello, my name is Zhang Gong Wei. His father is the prime minister, yet you all seem to bully him? You&#x2019;re not afraid of being him retaliating?&#x201D; I questioningly asked.</p><p>&#x201C;Hello, my name is Wo Ke Nuo Shi, the second grade representative. I major in wind magic. Those who are able to enter the Royal Intermediate Magic Academy are all outstanding talents. Here, only strength speaks.&#xA0;<em>Groan</em>&#xA0;Trash like him&#x2026; Furthermore, our principle and vice-principal are two of the ten magisters in all of the eastern continent. Within the kingdom, they have an exceedingly high status. In the academy&#x2019;s affairs, only those with exceedingly high statuses have a say.&#x201D; Wo Ke proudly explained.</p><p>There are still this many reasons. Ah. &#x201C;May I ask, what is the grade representative?&#x201D; Still puzzled, Ma Ke asked.</p><p>&#x201C;You don&#x2019;t even know this? The representative is the grade&#x2019;s most powerful.&#x201D; The green haired bedbug hurriedly answered.</p><p>&#x201C;Oh. Then Boss, can it be said that you are the representative of the new students?&#x201D; Ma Ke said to me.</p><p>In Wo Ke&#x2019;s eyes were a violent radiance. I thought it that if eyes could kill, I would surely kill Ma Ke a hundred times over. Seeing me staring at him unwaveringly, Ma Ke knew that he once again said something wrong.</p><p>&#x201C;You two are actually so strong. Then in our spare time we can spar for a bit.&#x201D; As expected, a troublesome matter has come. This Ma Ke, in order to ensure my safety, I definitely can&#x2019;t be with him in the future.</p><p>&#x201C;We&#x2019;re newly arrived students, how could we be on the same level as senior? Wait for us to study for two more years then we can spar.&#x201D; Once again, I promptly used the miracle of flattery. Simultaneously, I suggest to Wo Ke that since we are new students, he would be the big taking advantage of the small.</p><p>&#x201C;That&#x2019;s fine. You two must work hard! Don&#x2019;t lose face for our A class. Well then, I&#x2019;ll be going now. Green Hair, you still haven&#x2019;t gone to do you daily duty.&#x201D; It turns out he was here to find Green Hair to do the daily duty.</p><p>Me and Ma Ke walked around the academy. Everywhere we went, we saw many students. In addition to the newly admitted students, all of the higher grade students rarely make a sound. All of them are quietly practicing magic. This place&#x2019;s learning atmosphere is truly strong.</p><p>&#x201C;Boss, it looks like we must work hard. Look at these students, they&#x2019;re all practicing diligently. I reckon those people dressed extravagantly are nobility, yet they are unexpectedly incessantly practicing magic. Indeed worthy of being the Royal Magic Academy.&#x201D;</p><p>I also sighed somewhat. &#x201C;Yes. Let&#x2019;s go take a look at the library and look for whatever magic books we require. Then we can properly practice.&#x201D; The previously always lazy me, felt that I had no choice but to study. Witnessing this ambiance which is so wonderful.</p><p></p><hr><p></p>
