<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>Volume 5: Chapter 3 - Preparing for the Journey</strong></span></p><p><span style="">Teacher Di said, &#x201C;You&#x2026; Who can you blame for this? Who told you to not listen properly in class? Even though this competition is definitely shrouded in danger, I have complete faith in you. The other seven advanced academy definitely won&#x2019;t have any Magisters. You just have to keep the others safe. Do you understand?&#x201D; &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">I nodded. &#x201C;The reason why Teacher Zhen wanted me to go at all cost was probably for safety.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Teacher Di nodded. &#x201C;It is fine as long as you understand. I don&#x2019;t know why, but I keep getting bad feelings from Mu Zi. I just want to remind you again to pay attention to her.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">My mood dampened. Teacher Di seemed to dislike Mu Zi. &#x201C;Mu Zi is a very kind hearted girl. I have never gotten bad feelings from her.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Teacher Di smiled. &#x201C;Everyone is blind when they&#x2019;re in a relationship. Let&#x2019;s hope that what you&#x2019;ve said is true. It&#x2019;s really late so you should head back now, and besides, you are going on a long journey tomorrow. Have you got enough money? Do you need teacher to give you some more?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">I&#x2019;ve always known that Teacher Di treats me best. I shook my head. &#x201C;Teacher Zhen has given us all 1000 diamond coins so I have enough to spend. I may need to go away for a few months this time. Please take care of your health.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Teacher Di said with a gentle expression, &#x201C;I know that you&#x2019;re a good child. When you&#x2019;re outside, please pay attention to your surroundings. You mustn&#x2019;t be careless and remain modest and keep cool at all times.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">I respectfully agreed.</span></p><p><span style="">Teacher Di walked me to the entrance of the Intermediate Magic Academy. He gave me a few more warnings and sent me out of the Intermediate Magic Academy. </span></p><p><span style="">After leaving the Intermediate Magic Academy, I went to buy some daily commodities and some food that was a little less perishable from the main street and placed them in my spatial space. &#x2018;</span><i><span style="">Mu Zi is a little piglet. How can she go without food? I also can&#x2019;t bear to see Mu Zi starve. After interacting with her all this time, I feel that what she is most interested in is food.&#x2019; </span></i><span style="">After settling this, I headed back to the academy.</span></p><p><span style="">The night at the academy was really quiet, as all you could hear was some nocturnal birds calling out occasionally. I quietly walked back to my dormitory. Just as I was about to open the dormitory door, I heard a familiar voice call me from behind.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Zhang Gong, you&#x2019;re back!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">I became alert and shuddered; causing my goosebumps to rise up. I turned around and gave a sigh of relief. It was Hai Shui. I patted my chest. &#x201C;</span><i><span style="">Wah</span></i><span style="">! It&#x2019;s you, Hai Shui. You must know that a person can be scared to death!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Hai Shui lowered her head and said, &#x201C;Sorry!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">I asked her, &#x201C;Have you been waiting for me all this time?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Hai Shui nodded. &#x201C;That&#x2019;s right! Why are you back so late?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Hai Shui clearly had lost a lot of weight. I sighed in my heart. &#x201C;I went to Teacher Di for a while so I came back late.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Hai Shui dully said, &#x201C;You went to Teacher Di? Is it to bid him farewell?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">I was startled. &#x201C;How did you know?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Hai Shui replied, &#x201C;Sister told me that she was arranged by the Principal to participate in the eight Advanced Academy&#x2019;s competition. Why didn&#x2019;t you let me participate? Do you find me annoying?&#x201D; Her eyes became watery as she asked that. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">I hastily explained, &#x201C;Why would I feel that way? How could I avoid you. You should know that this competition isn&#x2019;t that simple. Moreover, I can&#x2019;t make the decision to decide who participate in the competition as it is Teacher Zhen&#x2019;s arrangement. I really didn&#x2019;t have a choice.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Hai Shui muttered, &#x201C;How about you help me beg the Principal to let me go with you guys.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">I said with difficulty, &#x201C;I&#x2019;m afraid that it is impossible as this matter has already been finalized and can&#x2019;t be changed. Hai Shui, just be my sister, alright?&#x201D; I looked at her to express my deepest feelings. </span></p><p><span style="">Hai Shui looked at me while tears were rolling down her delicate face. &#x201C;It can&#x2019;t be that we really aren&#x2019;t fated to be together, right? Why? Why does is it have to be this way?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">I didn&#x2019;t dare to help wipe her tears away, and instead consoled her saying, &#x201C;Hai Shui, don&#x2019;t be like this. There are still a lot of good guys available for you to choose from.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Hai Shui constantly shook her head and said, choked with sobs, &#x201C;I...I won&#x2019;t see you off to..tomorrow. I hope that you..you will stay safe during this trip.&#x201D; After she said that, she turned and ran away without looking back.</span></p><p><span style="">As I looked upon Hai Shui&#x2019;s back fading in the distance, I sighed heavily.</span></p><p><span style="">Dawn of the next day. I packed up and stopped by the girl&#x2019;s dormitory to get Mu Zi.</span></p><p><span style="">Mu Zi said, &#x201C;I have my own amethyst card so I will give yours back.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">I took the amethyst card back from her. &#x201C;When did Teacher Zhen give it to you? Why did I not know about that?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Mu Zi smiled, &#x201C;Before you come this morning, he had told a teacher to pass it to me and tell me that the card already has 1000 diamond coins.&#x201D; Teacher Zhen&#x2019;s efficiency wasn&#x2019;t too bad.</span></p><p><span style="">We had already unknowingly arrived at the entrance of the academy. Ma Ke was already there and was chatting to a student that had a robust body.</span></p><p><span style="">I walked over and said, &#x201C;Ma Ke, you&#x2019;re quite early.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Ma Ke smiled and replied, &#x201C;I had to come early. Boss, what do you think about my clothes?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">I then noticed that there was something different in his clothing. He wore a bright red magic robe and there was gold embroidered on the robe. It seemed that he had cleaned up a lot, which suited his originally valiant and formidable-looking appearance.</span></p><p><span style="">I smiled, &#x201C;Not bad! You&#x2019;ve really put in some efforts. This is?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Ma Ke saw me looking at the student beside him and hastily introduced him to me, &#x201C;This is Si Wa Ming, the academy&#x2019;s top expert.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Ah! It&#x2019;s him! I looked at him carefully. He seemed to be 170cm tall and looked very sturdy. It was as though he was a warrior.</span></p><p><span style="">He extended his hand to me and said, &#x201C; How can I be the academy&#x2019;s top expert in front of Zhang Gong? Hehe.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">So he was that easy going. I shook his hand and said, &#x201C;Brother Si Wa, you&#x2019;re too courteous. Reputation comes naturally from real distinction so your position as the academy&#x2019;s top expert should still be yours.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Mu Zi said from beside me, &#x201C;That&#x2019;s enough! You don&#x2019;t need to be so formal with each other. Why hasn&#x2019;t Hai Yue come yet?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Ma Ke replied, &#x201C;That&#x2019;s right! Why isn&#x2019;t she here yet? It is nearly time to depart. It can&#x2019;t be that she is not coming right?&#x201D; &#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">I shook my head, &#x201C;She has to come, since this is a decision that the academy made. Surely, she will come.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Just as I said that, Hai Yue&#x2019;s familiar figure appeared in our sight. She was similar to Hai Shui as she had also lost a lot of weight. She looked really pitiful.</span></p><p><span style="">Ma Ke showed a little heartbroken expression and went up to her. &#x201C;Hai Yue, you&#x2019;ve finally come.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Hai Yue coldly glared at him and wasn&#x2019;t at all interested in his new attire. She didn&#x2019;t bother replying to him and walked past him after glaring viciously at me. &#x201C;Everyone has gathered already. Let&#x2019;s go!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Mu Zi walked up and said. &#x201C;Hai Yue, it seems that you have lost a lot of weight.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Hai Yue looked at her and said, &#x201C;Really?&#x201D; And simply turned and walked out of the academy without waiting for anyone else. I patted Mu Zi&#x2019;s shoulder to gesture her to follow her.</span></p><p><span style="">Si Wa Ming obviously didn&#x2019;t understand our interpersonal relations so he &#xA0;just felt that something was up with Hai Yue.</span></p><p><span style="">Our group of five step foot on the road towards Martial Return City.</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p>
