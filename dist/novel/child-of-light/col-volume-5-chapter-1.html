<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>Volume 5: Chapter 1 - Negotiating Suitable Conditions</strong></span></p><p><span style="">After Mu Zi and I left the classroom, I told her about Teacher Zhen&#x2019;s solution. She laughed brightly, and I blankly asked, &#x201C;Why are you laughing? Is participating in the competition with me really making you that happy?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Mu Zi smiled and said, &#x201C;You&#x2019;re usually very quick witted. Why are you so slow this time? Teacher Zhen has obviously tricked you. &#xA0;Since we are the top students in the Royal Advanced Academy, we hold special privileges in the entire Kingdom of Aixia. It is possible that we won&#x2019;t be severely punished even if we killed somebody. Moreover, it was only rebuking the teacher. Teacher Zhen must have been afraid about your laziness and that you wouldn&#x2019;t want to participate in the National Advanced Magic Academies&#x2019; competition, so he came up with this plan to make you agree to participate.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Mu Zi&#x2019;s words helped me confirm my feelings. </span><i><span style="">&#x2018;That&#x2019;s right! I&#x2019;m a Magister. How could I be punished? Except for Teacher Di, who else would be able to control me in the Kingdom? I&#x2019;ve really been tricked.&#x2019;</span></i></p><p><span style="">I bitterly laughed. &#x201C;Teacher Zhen is really crafty, but since it&#x2019;s too late to regret it, let&#x2019;s just treat it as an outing.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Mu Zi nodded. &#x201C;But I think this competition might not be that simple. If it was, why would Teacher Zhen be so set on having you participate? He could just randomly choose a few strong students, instead of us, to participate in the competition.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">I held Mu Zi&#x2019;s hand. &#x201C;It doesn&#x2019;t matter as long as we deal with it together... though I doubt there&#x2019;ll be anything that could get the better of me! Haha!&#x201D; My confidence had increased greatly after the strenuous victory over Si Feng Ri.</span></p><p><span style="">Mu Zi, who was both displeased and annoyed, took back her hand and said, &#x201C;It&#x2019;s still broad daylight. How can you behave like this? Annoying!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">I leaned over and smiled. &#x201C;In that case, tonight&#x2026;?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Mu Zi knocked on my head before she turned and ran away. &#x201C;You&#x2019;re hateful! Let&apos;s just quickly go to where Teacher Zhen is.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Teacher Zhen was reclined in his seat and seemed as though he was looking at something when we entered his office.</span></p><p><span style="">After he saw us entering the room, Teacher Zhen put down the magic book he was reading. &#x201C;You two have come. Mu Zi, Zhang Gong must have told you about the competition.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Mu Zi nodded.</span></p><p><span style="">Teacher Zhen smiled. &#x201C;That&#x2019;s great! I&#x2019;ll have to trouble you two this time.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">I bitterly smiled. &#x201C;You&#x2019;re quite capable to have created a trap especially for me. I was totally tricked this time.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Teacher Zhen broke into laughter. &#x201C;It&#x2019;s a pity that it&#x2019;s already too late for regrets, even if you&#x2019;ve realized it. The task for this competition is very easy, so don&#x2019;t complain. I am unable to send teachers with you as the Academy still has to function normally. You can just go there by yourselves. I have already made arrangements to notify the rest of the students participating in the competition. You&#x2019;ll head out tomorrow morning. Zhang Gong, I really don&#x2019;t have a choice. Please don&#x2019;t blame me.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">What was the point of refuting him if it had already been finalized? It looked like the time was actually quite limited, so we&#x2019;ll have to head out tomorrow. &#x201C;Let&#x2019;s just head out tomorrow then. Is there anything else we will need to take note of?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Teacher Zhen gave me a piece of paper. &#x201C;This is a recommendation letter. All of your names are on it. I have written that you&#x2019;re all magic scholars so that it won&#x2019;t be too ostentatious. You just have to directly head to Forest Dragon Magic Academy. There will be people there to receive you. &#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">I took the introductory letter. Written on it was how my academy would be sending a year five student, Earth magic scholar, Si Wa Ming; a year four student, Water magic scholar, Hai Yue Xin; a year three student, Fire magic scholar, Ma Ke Sai De (His previous alias was used so as to not expose him); similarly, a year three student, Light magic scholar Zhang Gong Wei; and finally, a year three student, Wind magic scholar, Mu Zi Mo to participate in the Triennial National Advanced Magic Academies&#x2019; competition.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Royal Advanced Academy&#x2019; was inscribed at the top of the letter along with Teacher Zhen&#x2019;s signature and the Royal Advanced Academy&#x2019;s official seal stamped on it.</span></p><p><span style="">I said, &#x201C;This team is really compatible! Except for a dark magic magician, the other five elements have been covered.&#x201D; After hearing my words, Mu Zi&#x2019;s expression twitched a little, but it recovered before I noticed it. </span></p><p><span style="">Teacher Zhen replied, &#x201C;That&#x2019;s right! You&#x2019;ll become representatives of the strongest users of each of the elements. You must work hard.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">I asked, &#x201C;Do you still have something to give us? It can&#x2019;t be just this paper, right?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Teacher Zhen nodded. &#x201C;That&#x2019;s correct! You only need this paper. What else do you want?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">I rubbed my forefinger against my thumb. &#x201C;How about giving us some money for our expenditures? We are helping the school compete in this competition. You should make an amethyst card for everyone. Hehe.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Teacher Zhen mockingly scolded. &#x201C;You shouldn&#x2019;t be so greedy. Do you think that the amethyst card is that easy to make? However, it&#x2019;s alright. I will give it to you. Hehe. Actually, other than Mu Zi, all of you have the amethyst card already, so don&#x2019;t think that I don&#x2019;t know about it. Getting the amethyst card for Mu Zi is understandable as it&#x2019;s paired with her capability. I have decided to give all of you 1000 diamond coins. This should be more than sufficient for your expenditures.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">I wanted to exclaim that I felt like I had been duped. &#x2018;</span><i><span style="">That&#x2019;s right! Si Wa Ming is the Royal Mage Union leader&#x2019;s disciple. How can he not have an amethyst</span></i> <i><span style="">card? There obviously isn&#x2019;t a need to comment about Ma Ke. Hai Yue is an elite of the young generation in one of the three main families. I feel as though I have made a loss. If I had known that, I would have picked something else. An old ginger is indeed hotter than a young ginger!&#x2019;</span></i></p><p><span style="">Mu Zi asked, &#x201C;Are there any benefits in obtaining the championship?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Teacher Zhen smiled and replied, &#x201C;Of course there are. The academy will record your great achievements and someone with a negative record will have all of his demerit points erased from the records.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">I angrily said, &#x201C;</span><i><span style="">Wah</span></i><span style="">! You&#x2019;re really too&#x2026;&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Mu Zi also complained, &#x201C;The academy is so stingy and still wants us to expend our energy for it.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Teacher Zhen replied, &#x201C;Then what more do you want? How about this? If you bring back the championship, you will be able to change your status at the Magic Union for free.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">It looks like it is a little useful as my current status is only that of a Great Mage. </span></p><p><span style="">Mu Zi, on the other hand, was still unsatisfied. &#x201C;You really don&#x2019;t have a substantial reward?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Teacher Zhen was taken aback and replied, &#x201C;You don&#x2019;t need to worry about your next meal or having clothes on your back, what other substantial award do you want? Didn&#x2019;t I already agree to give all of you 1000 diamond coins?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">I suddenly thought of an idea. &#x201C;How about this? We don&#x2019;t want to make things difficult for the school. How about giving us the right to get free food at a restaurant with your assistance? It will just be used during our school years. All of our expenditures will be paid for by the school. After all, the academy&#x2019;s food really isn&#x2019;t that nice.&#x201D; &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">Teacher Zhen replied, &#x201C;What? The food in the academy is not nice? This is a problem. I&#x2019;ll definitely have it changed. I&#x2019;ll accept your condition.&#x201D; He thought, </span><i><span style="">&#x2018;Just how much money can you spend on food in a month, even if you can eat a lot?&#x2019;</span></i></p><p><span style="">Mu Zi looked at me in agreement. &#x201C;Alright! I will represent the team about having our meals at the Ascending Jade Tide in the future.&#x201D;</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p>
