<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>Volume 6: Chapter 3 - Returning to Xiao Jin&apos;s Home</strong></span></p><p><span style="">I thought, &#x2018;</span><i><span style="">I really don&#x2019;t want to bring Xiao Jin back. After returning Xiao Jin, will he still want to leave with me? My feelings for Xiao Jin are extremely deep. Without him at my side, I will feel even more empty.&#x2019;</span></i></p><p><span style="">I helplessly said, &#x201C;Must I really send him back?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Teacher Di nodded. &#x201C;That&#x2019;s right! You must send him home. Actually, it may not be a bad thing. The Dragon King might appreciate your effort in bringing his son back and help you fight with the Monster King in the future.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">A trace of reluctance appeared in my heart. I pitifully replied, &#x201C;But I really don&#x2019;t want to be separated from Xiao Jin!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Teacher Di said very sternly, &#x201C;Zhang Gong, how can you be like this? Don&#x2019;t you think that you are being too selfish? Moreover, if you are overly dependant on Xiao Jin&#x2019;s power, it will greatly hamper your future path in improvement. No matter what, you must bring him home.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">I lowered my head and the thoughts in my heart surged out like waves. </span><i><span style="">&#x2018;Xiao Jin the only partner who has always been by my side is leaving me? I am really reluctant to lose you. Xiao Jin! Even though Xiao Jin really is a powerful partner, my feelings for him isn&#x2019;t because of his massive strength. Thinking of that year when Xiao Jin hatched, he had never left me since so to send him back like this, I...I&#x2026;&#x2019; &#xA0;</span></i></p><p><span style="">Teacher Di softly said, &#x201C;I know this matter is really hard on you, but think about it. If Xiao Jin continues to follow you, he can only live to be around 60 years, whereas, the Dragon Clan can live up to a few thousands of years. It can&#x2019;t be that your reluctance to lose him outweighed his right to live, right?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">I was moved and replied, &#x201C;Teacher Di, you&#x2019;re saying&#x2026;.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Teacher Di nodded. &#x201C;If I haven&#x2019;t guess incorrectly, Xiao Jin&#x2019;s father should have the ability to regain his initial life expectancy.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">I clenched my teeth and replied, &#x201C;Alright! For Xiao Jin&#x2019;s future, I am willing to bring him back.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Teacher Di smiled in relief. &#x201C;That&#x2019;s my good student. It was worth it for Xiao Jin to follow you for this period. Initially, I thought that it would be best to wait for you to graduate from the Advanced Magic Academy before going. However, your current ability has already exceeded my expectations. Moreover, there is still the threat of the Monster&#xA0;King in a couple of years so I have decided to have you look for the Dragon Valley earlier. You should still have the book I gave to you about dragons. The method to reach it is on the last page. Once holidays begin, you should head out. After sending Xiao Jin back, you should visit your home. There should be enough time for you to do accomplish all of those things.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">I replied, &#x201C;It should be the book &apos;The True King of the World - Dragons&#x2019;. I have read through it. The Dragon Valley should be in the Aixia&#x2019;s territory approximately in one of the Sky Province&#x2019;s mountain valleys.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Teacher Di nodded. &#x201C;You will have to search for the actual position yourself. You must remember to stay safe. Don&#x2019;t forget about the teleportation scroll I gave you the last time you went out to gain experience. You must use it if you encounter an emergency.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">I replied, &#x201C;Alright! Relax! I&#x2019;ve already weathered so many storms and the purpose of this trip is to do something good, it should not be too dangerous.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Teacher Di replied, &#x201C;No matter what, it&#x2019;s always best to be careful. Have some dinner before you head back.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">After accompanying Teacher Di in having dinner, I returned to the Royal Advanced Magic Academy.</span></p><p><span style="">As I laid down on my bed in the dormitory, I silently thought, &#x2018;</span><i><span style="">I&#x2019;ll soon be separated from Xiao Jin. I also don&#x2019;t know what will happen during the journey to Dragon Valley. I&#x2019;m really reluctant to be separated from Xiao Jin who has been with me for so many years.&#x2019;</span></i></p><p><span style="">I went to the classroom the next day. I wrote on a strip of paper, &#x201C;It&#x2019;ll be vacation really soon. What&#x2019;s your plans?&#x201D;, before giving it to Mu Zi.</span></p><p><span style="">Mu Zi quickly replied. She wrote a line of words below mine, &#x201C;I&#x2019;m going home. How about you?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">I tested her as I wrote, &#x201C;Can we go back together?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Mu Zi replied, &#x201C;That&#x2019;s not good. My home is rather reclusive. It is better that I head back by myself.&#x201D; After seeing her reply, my mood had sunk even more.</span></p><p><span style="">I wrote back, &#x201C;I&#x2019;ll forget about it then. Since you&#x2019;re not willing for me to accompany you, I also have to go to a place to settle a matter.</span></p><p><span style="">Mu Zi replied back, &#x201C;Where to? What are you going to do?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">I wrote back, &#x201C;I am returning Xiao Jin back to Dragon Valley to let him reunite with his family.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Mu Zi wrote back, &#x201C;The Dragon Valley is too dangerous. It is better that you ask Ma Ke to accompany you. If you return Xiao Jin, you probably won&#x2019;t have any magical beast.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">I wrote, &#x201C;It doesn&#x2019;t matter. It&#x2019;s very important that Xiao Jin can reunite with his family. Ma Ke is currently busy, so I don&#x2019;t want to disturb him. The journey this time shouldn&#x2019;t be dangerous so I should be able to head there myself.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Mu Zi replied back, &#x201C;Are you unhappy about me?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">I wrote back, &#x201C;No, why should I be?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Mu Zi wrote back, &#x201C;Then, why were you ignoring me this few days?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">I wrote, &#x201C;You should know why. Can you please just tell me why even when I conveyed my true feelings for you, I still can&#x2019;t make you open up to me?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Mu Zi remained quiet for a while before writing back, &#x201C;Zhang Gong, I&#x2019;m in a really, really tough situation. Can you please stop asking me, alright? If the heavens has planned for us to be together, you will find that out in the future. Do you still remember that story you wrote for the hundredth letter you gave me? I will eventually be like the main female lead in the story and love you wholeheartedly. Will you wait for me?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">This was the first time that I felt such closeness between Mu Zi and I. Elated, I wrote my reply, &#x201C;Of course, I am willing. I&#x2019;ll definitely unwaveringly wait for you. I&#x2019;ll stop pressing you. I just hope that you won&#x2019;t let me wait too long to the point where I won&#x2019;t have the strength to hug you.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">After reading my reply, Mu Zi&#x2019;s face reddened and looked at me before laughing. She wrote back, &#x201C;You&#x2019;re so irritating. Let&#x2019;s go out for lunch together.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">I nodded, but didn&#x2019;t write anything. My heart felt much better as I felt that Mu Zi and I had become closer.</span></p><p><span style="">It was Mu Zi who wrote another note instead. &#x201C;Actually, Hai Shui is very compatible with you. You shouldn&#x2019;t continue hurting her.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">After reading what she said, I bafflingly whispered to her, &#x201C;If I don&#x2019;t hurt her, then I will be hurting you.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Mu Zi smiled and shook her head. &#x201C;Why would I be? It is completely normal for a capable guy to have a few wives in my homeland.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">I astonishingly replied, &#x201C;Can a person&#x2019;s feelings truly be distributed? It can&#x2019;t be that you&#x2019;re willing to share the feelings I have for you alone with others? ? I had placed all of my affections on you. Is that bad?&#x201D; &#x2018;</span><i><span style="">I really don&#x2019;t understand how she thinks. Even having the idea of sharing her sweetheart.&#x2019;</span></i></p><p></p><hr><p></p>
