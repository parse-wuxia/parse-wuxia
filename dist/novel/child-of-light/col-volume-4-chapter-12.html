I raised my head. The Gold Dan from my upper dantian surged with magic power that filled my entire body. I gathered the light elements to make an approximately five meter in diameter pillar and made it fly toward Feng Liang.</p><p>&#x201C;Light magician!&#x201D; The surrounding students gasped.</p><p>With my magic power at the time, Brilliant Empire was very different from before. When the violent Wind Tornado and Brilliant Empire spells collided, Feng Liang&#x2019;s magic power was unexpectedly very powerful. This was probably related to the way his spell was cast.</p><p>Atop the field, a hurricane began swirling into existence. I was pushed back three steps by his Wind Tornado as I wasn&#x2019;t prepared for it. The air that was lost came back again.</p><p>Feng Liang was fine, but he looked shocked. &#x201C;You could actually easily counter my violent storm wind!&#x201D;</p><p>I dusted the dirt off my body. &#x201C;It&#x2019;s been some time since someone placed me in a disadvantageous position. The magic spell you just used was great! Is that your original spell?&#x201D;</p><p>Feng Liang nodded. &#x201C;I made Wind Tornados spinning in opposite directions to collide. The final, fused Wind Tornado has a very strong offensive power.&#x201D;</p><p>I was surprised. &#x201C;Your magic control is really strong. Let&#x2019;s continue! I want to see if you have any other exceptional spells. Any spells weaker than the one you used just now will be useless against me.&#x201D;</p><p>Feng Liang couldn&#x2019;t help but smile. &#x201C;You&#x2019;re interesting for warning your opponent. A good opponent such as yourself is really hard to find. I shall let you experience my Ri family&#x2019;s traditional magic spell.&#x201D;</p><p>After hearing that he was going to use a traditional spell, my heart trembled in fear as I remembered how disastrous it had been when I previously fought with Hai Shui. I instantly raised my guard and secretly started to gather my magic power in my right hand.</p><p>Feng Liang quickly chanted and six walls of wind swiftly gathered in front of him to protext him. &#x2018;<i>It was obvious that it is to gain some times to cast the more powerful spell. Seeing how cautious he was, I knew that the long spell he was chanting wouldn&#x2019;t be easy to counter.&#x2019; &#xA0;</i></p><p>I waved my right hand and a huge light blade struck his defensive wall of wind. Feng Liang&#x2019;s facial expression suddenly changed. &#x201C;<i>The day lights up in the sky, the heavenly hound shall descend. It is impossible to resist and will engulf everything and bring endless darkness to the land&#x2014;Heavenly Sun Devouring Hound!</i>&#x201D;</p><p>Once my light blade succeeded in breaking his walls of wind, he finished chanting the spell. Feng Liang&#x2019;s face paled and his blond hair turned black and straightened. His eyes seemed to emit a light. He started to chant something I didn&#x2019;t understand. A dark aura surrounded his body.</p><p>When the light blade struck at his head, the dark aura vigorously scraped against the blade. The light elements unexpectedly started to diffuse and no longer released their powers.</p><p><i>&#x2018;I was scared! What was that magic? Why did it seem so similar to that magic clan&#x2019;s bamboo pole&#x2019;s magic? Wasn&#x2019;t Feng Liang from the Ri family? How could he know dark magic?&#x2019; &#xA0;</i></p><p>Mu Zi, who was in the crowd watching the match, showed a strange expression and was very interested in the spell Feng Liang cast.</p><p>The black aura surrounding Feng Liang thickened. He started to speak in a foreign language. &#x201C;This is our Ri family&#x2019;s <i>Heavenly Sun Devouring Hound </i>spell! You are lucky that I only recently inherited the spell. The main special effect of the spell is that it can engulf everything, including magic elements. I hope that you will not be the first sacrifice to this spell! Hehehehe&#x2026;&#x201D;</p><p>Hai Yue who was behind him was also frightened by his evil appearance. She had never imagined that her prince on a white horse could become so cold. He was like a totally different person.</p><p>I was totally frightened from his sudden change and hurriedly chanted, &#x201C;<i>Righteous, gentle, warm, serious, strict lights and lights of destruction! Please gather at my side and become endless light rays to exterminate all evil and bring salvation to the world!&#x2014;- Infinite Radiant Lights</i>!&#x201D; This was my last trump card, the advanced spell I had only learned recently.</p><p>Feng Liang&#x2019;s spell finished. He suddenly let out a long, mourning cry. The black aura surrounding his body surged out and formed a huge hound shape before pouncing towards me.</p><p>A strong pressure suddenly covered the area. My body began to radiate golden lights. They were from my upper Dantian&#x2019;s Gold Dan, a clear, spherical, transparent golden ball the size of a ping pong ball that could increase my magic power. All I could do was release it to increase my magic power gathering speed. The light elements from my surroundings started to gather. Under my control, my Gold Dan released a ray of gentle, one meter in diameter golden light, and shot it towards the &#x2018;Heavenly Hound&#x2019;.</p><p>The &#x2018;Heavenly Hound&#x2019; in the air opened its mouth to try and devour the golden light. I could feel my magic power quickly decreasing. Feng Liang&#x2019;s situation was also not that good. Once the &#x2018;Heavenly Hound&#x2019; started to absorb the golden light, his entire body shivered and he coughed out a mouthful of blood. He continued to bitterly hold on as supporting the spell used a lot of his energy. He continued to chant foreign words and his body kept supplying dark energy to the &#x2018;Heavenly Hound&#x2019;.</p><p><i>&#x2018;This couldn&#x2019;t carry on. If I allowed him to continue supporting the spell, my power would eventually weaken and the spell would totally engulf me along with with my magic spell! I could only fight using all of my abilities.&#x2019;</i></p><p>&#x2018;<i>I thought of my total failure in defeating him as I made the Gold Dan emit golden light and simultaneously made it go towards the mouth of the &#x2018;Heavenly Hound&#x2019;. As the Gold Dan and the golden light vanished in the huge mouth of the &#x2018;Heavenly Hound&#x2019;, I got nervous. If I couldn&#x2019;t defeat it with that move, my chances of succeeding would decrease, even if I was to recover all of my lost magic power.&#x2019;</i></p><p>The &#x2018;Heavenly Hound&#x2019; that was in the air tumbled and slowly lost its Hound shape. &#x201C;<i>Peng</i>!&#x201D; The &#x2018;Heavenly Hound&#x2019; exploded, leaving the dim Gold Dan in the air. I immediately used my remaining power to retrieve it. I had used a lot of magic power, but luckily the Gold Dan hadn&#x2019;t been completely used up.</p><p>Feng Liang showed a strange expression and I started to shout. <i>Not good</i>! Feng Liang spat out a mist of blood. Blood came gushing out from all seven of his apertures and he fell to the ground.</p><p>I used short distance teleportation to move to his side. &#x2018;<i>Previously I really couldn&#x2019;t have held back! If not, I really would&#x2019;ve been engulfed by that magic spell.&#x2019;</i></p><p>When I appeared in front of him, his hair had gone back to normal. He was in a severe condition. I immediately used my remaining power to cast a recovery spell to stabilize his condition.</p><p></p><hr><p></p>
