<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>Volume 4: Chapter 42 - A Compassionate Breakfast</strong></span></p><p><span style="">Ma Ke chuckled and said, &#x201C;Now, you&#x2019;ve also experienced Brother Hai Ri&#x2019;s magic baptism. You don&#x2019;t know how much I suffered back then. </span><i><span style="">Haha</span></i><span style="">!&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">I punched him once before saying, &#x201C;You brat! You dare to make fun of me? If you still have the energy to tease me, why don&#x2019;t you go and chase after Hai Yue before you lose the opportunity to do so?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Ma Ke was stunned for a moment before he foolishly asked, &#x201C;Hai Yue? Why should I chase her?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">When I saw that Ma Ke was speaking foolishly, I said smilingly, &#x201C;Aren&#x2019;t you usually intelligent? Why is it that whenever it involves Hai Yue, you become so dumb? You need to carefully think it through.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Ma Ke frowned as he looked at me. After thinking for a while, his eyes gradually brightened up. He exclaimed, &#x201C;Boss, are you saying&#x2026;.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">I nodded. &#x201C;That&#x2019;s right! What you thought is correct. Feng Liang has already run away with his grandfather. This is a great opportunity. You must seize this opportunity. Don&#x2019;t let it slip away.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Ma Ke cheered a little before he turned and ran. </span></p><p><span style="">I hastily yelled at him, &#x201C;Ma Ke, where are you going? You should attend your classes first.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Ma Ke shouted as he ran, &#x201C;I&#x2019;m not going to class. I&#x2019;ll be going to Hai Yue&#x2019;s classroom to wait for her class to end.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">He really prioritized love over friends. I hope he will succeed. When I reached the entrance of the classroom, it was a lesson on magic tactics. The teacher was one of the academy&#x2019;s famous instructors. </span></p><p><span style="">I shouted from outside, &#x201C;Permission to enter!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Come in!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I&#x2019;m sorry that I&#x2019;m late, teacher.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Quickly take your seat and remember to be on time next time.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">I let out a long breath before I quickly took my seat. Mu Zi smiled at me and whispered, &#x201C;Why are you late again?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">I replied, &#x201C;I spent all night thinking about about you last night and overslept this morning.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Mu Zi&#x2019;s face flushed and she replied, &#x201C;You&#x2019;re too talkative. I knew you would be late today. Just take this!&#x201D; After she said that, she passed me a lunch box.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What is this?&#x201D; I curiously asked.</span></p><p><span style="">Mu Zi replied, &#x201C;See it for yourself.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">I opened the container and saw it was filled with delicious food. That&#x2019;s great! Mu Zi took a mug of fruit juice from under her table before saying, &#x201C;Eat carefully! Don&#x2019;t let the teacher catch you eating. Ever since I met you, I&#x2019;ve become such a delinquent.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">I grabbed her hand and kissed it. &#x201C;The feeling of having a wife is so great. Thank you so much, my wife.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Mu Zi hit me before withdrawing her hand. &#x201C;Who&#x2019;s your wife? You&#x2019;re hateful. Just quickly eat your food!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">As I ate, I said, &#x201C;This love filled breakfast that my wife made me is so delicious. It&#x2019;s too delicious. Hmm, why are you staring at me? Are you hungry? Here, have some!&#x201D; I grabbed a piece of chicken and gave it to her. </span></p><p><span style="">Mu Zi angrily said, &#x201C;You just have to eat! Why do you have so much to say? I won&#x2019;t make it for you anymore.&#x201D; Even though she said that, she took the chicken from my hand and secretly ate it. </span></p><p><span style="">I suppressed my laughter and said, &#x201C;Little piggy!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Mu Zi snorted. &#x201C;You&#x2019;re the piggy, not me, you monkey!&#x201D; After she said that, she giggled uncontrollably.</span></p><p><span style="">I felt wronged and said, &#x201C;Am I that ugly?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The teacher on the lecture platform said, &#x201C;Zhang Gong and Mu Zi! Stand up!&#x201D; </span><i><span style="">Wah</span></i><span style="">! This was bad. We were noticed by the teacher.</span></p><p><span style="">I quickly placed the breakfast on my seat, before standing up. Mu Zi stood up as well. </span></p><p><span style="">The forty year old teacher glared at us. &#x201C;What&#x2019;s going on with the two of you? You&#x2019;re not listening in class and keep on whispering in class.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Mu Zi and I looked at each other but didn&#x2019;t reply to the teacher. The teacher continued saying, &#x201C;That&#x2019;s enough! Take your seat. Please pay more attention in class, especially you, Zhang Gong! Don&#x2019;t think you can just slack off with only a little accomplishment in your magic. There are already a few teachers who have commented on your behaviour in class. If you carry on being like this, you might face expulsion from the academy.&#x201D; </span></p><p><i><span style="">Ah</span></i><span style="">! It couldn&#x2019;t be that bad. </span><i><span style="">Hehe</span></i><span style="">! It shouldn&#x2019;t matter as I have a good relationship with Teacher Zhen. He wouldn&#x2019;t expel me.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;The Principal said that if you continue to break the class rules, we should instantly write up a note for disciplinary action. You were late today and now you aren&#x2019;t paying attention in class.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">How could Teacher Zhen do this to me? It hurt my heart badly.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;There&#x2019;s also Mu Zi. You&#x2019;re an exceptional student. Why have you not been studying properly after Zhang Gong transferred to the academy? I&#x2019;ll be going to discuss this with the teacher in charge of this class to make you two sit separately.&#x201D;</span></p><p><i><span style="">Ah</span></i><span style="">! He was going to separate Mu Zi from me. It mustn&#x2019;t happen! I straightened my body and glared at the teacher. &#x201C;Teacher, it was my fault for talking in class, but Mu Zi doesn&#x2019;t have anything to do with this. She keeps on ignoring me. I&#x2019;ll take notice of this in the future. It shouldn&#x2019;t be serious enough to change our seats over, right?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">This teacher probably hadn&#x2019;t seen such a bold student. He was stunned for a while before saying, &#x201C;Zhang Gong, is this the tone you should be using while addressing a teacher? Get out of the class and stand in the corridor as your punishment!&#x201D; &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">He wanted me to stand outside as punishment? How could I? I still hadn&#x2019;t eaten my breakfast! I coldly replied, &#x201C;I don&#x2019;t want to!&#x201D; I just sat in my seat and ate my breakfast.</span></p><p><span style="">Mu Zi, who was beside me, kept pulling on me, gesturing me to stop quarreling with the teacher.</span></p><p><span style="">The teacher&#x2019;s expression on the lecture platform ashened. &#x201C;Zhang Gong, this is your last chance. Are you going to get out or not?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">My stubborness rose, and I angrily rebuked, &#x201C;I&#x2019;m not going to. As a teacher, why aren&#x2019;t you teaching the class properly instead of letting such a small matter affect your teaching process?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The teacher said &#x2018;good&#x2019; thrice before walking out of the class. &#x2018;</span><i><span style="">It couldn&#x2019;t be that he was indicating I was such a good student to praise me thrice?&#x2019;</span></i></p><p><span style="">The class was in an uproar instantly, but no one dared to question me.</span></p><p><span style="">Mu Zi sat down and said, &#x201C;Zhang Gong, why did you quarrel with the teacher? This is going to be bad for you.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">I felt I was wronged and looked at her. &#x201C;I wanted to eat the breakfast you had given me. How could I eat it in the corridor?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Mu Zi helplessly said, &#x201C;You! You&#x2019;re in deep trouble. That teacher must have gone to find the Principal. He might even expel you.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">I smiled and said, &#x201C;That wouldn&#x2019;t happen as I have a good relationship with Teacher Zhen. How could he expel me?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">After a short while, the teacher returned with signs of ridicule in his expression as he entered the classroom with Teacher Zhen. Teacher Zhen frowned and said, &#x201C;Zhang Gong, get out of the class!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">After hearing Teacher Zhen&#x2019;s words, I obediently went out of class. He turned to the teacher to tell him to carry on teaching the class. After that, he took me to the corridor.</span></p><p><span style="">Teacher Zhen said, &#x201C;Why is this happening? Are you purposely making trouble for me? You&#x2019;re not listening in class and even made the teacher of the class complain to me about you. After all that is said and done, what&#x2019;s going on with you? Do you really want me to go and complain to Teacher Di?&#x201D; &#xA0;</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p>
