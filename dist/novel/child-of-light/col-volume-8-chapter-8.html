<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>Volume 8: Chapter 8 - Magic Crystal</strong></span></p><p><span style="">After leaving the inn, I wandered around without any destination. I thought, </span><i><span style="">&#x2018;I really have lost my standing in Aixia. I also don&#x2019;t know how the teachers are faring, and that adorable Hai Shui too, I don&#x2019;t know if I will be able to meet them again someday.&#x2019;</span></i></p><p><span style="">As I walked on, I suddenly heard someone shout, &#x201C;This is the opening day of my shop. I welcome everyone to come forward to peruse and purchase some of my items.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">I raised my head and found it was a jewellery shop. I was moved as now I was traveling with 100 people. &#x2018;</span><i><span style="">The expenditure is not little. The Diamond coins on me are also running out. I shall go and sell some of my jewels.&#x2019;</span></i></p><p><span style="">Thinking of this, I walked over. This jewel shop was obviously renovated quite recently; it looked really grand. Just as I walked to the entrance, a servant welcomed me and asked, &#x201C;Mister, please come in, and have a look. We have just opened our businesses so there will be discounts.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">I nodded and followed him in.</span></p><p><span style="">There was a lot of people in the jewel shop who were selecting things that caught their eyes.</span></p><p><span style="">I asked the servant, &#x201C;Do you accept gemstones here?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The servant was briefly stunned before replying, &#x201C;Yes, we do accept them. Do you have gemstones that you want to sell?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">I nodded.</span></p><p><span style="">The servant replied, &#x201C;Please wait for a moment, and I will bring someone over.&#x201D; After he said that, he turned around and entered a building. </span></p><p><span style="">Shortly after, the servant walked out with a middle aged person that seemed to be a merchant. He said, &#x201C;This is our boss. You should talk to him instead.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The boss said, &#x201C;My greetings to you. Let&#x2019;s have a chat inside.&#x201D; This boss really knew how to do a business. He knew that valuables shouldn&#x2019;t be revealed inadvertently.</span></p><p><span style="">He let me into his office and closed the door before he asked, &#x201C;Mister, what are you planning to sell?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">I took a fist-sized purple crystal from my space pocket and gave it to him. The boss exclaimed, &#x201C;A purple crystal, and a large one at that!&#x201D; He took it carefully, fondling it with admiration as he looked at it.</span></p><p><span style="">I asked, &#x201C;Will you accept it?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The boss nodded, then shook his head before he replied, &#x201C;This crystal is too precious. It is flawless, and can withhold a great amount of magic power. It is a high-grade purple crystal that can support an aerial magic artillery that could shoot at least 1000 times. I&#x2019;m afraid that we won&#x2019;t be able to afford it.&#x201D; (It is extremely difficult to move the Magic Cannon. Even though it&#x2019;s very powerful, it can only used for the protection of the city. Every time it fired, it&#x2019;s equivalent to an Advanced Grade magic attack. It also needs a long time to gather it&#x2019;s power for every shot. The main source of it&#x2019;s power is the magic crystal. Since magic crystals are precious, except for a minority of important towns, the Str&#xF6;m Fortress had prepared 200 aerial magic artilleries. This was also one of the main reasons why the Str&#xF6;m Fortress was so firm.) </span></p><p><span style="">Such a big jewel shop couldn&#x2019;t afford to buy a purple jewel? I frowned, &#x201C;Please give me an estimation of its price.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The boss replied unhesitantly, &#x201C;The minimum price is 20,000 diamond coins.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">It was worth that much? 20,000 diamond coins was an astronomical value to me. I smiled and replied, &#x201C;Even though this price is rather low, I&#x2019;m in need of money. If you want, I will sell it to you for 20,000 diamond coins.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The boss eyes lit up. It was obvious that the crystal was worth far more than the price offered. &#xA0;He clenched his teeth and replied, &#x201C;How about this, please wait for a moment. I will gather some friends to see if we have enough money. Initially, we could afford the crystal, however I have just started business, so some of the funds were spent on purchasing goods, and I do not have enough money that I can readily give you. &#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The boss hastily went out,while I played with the crystal in my hand. Although I could feel that it contained strong magic power, there wasn&#x2019;t anything special about it, and it unexpectedly was worth so much. If he knew what I had wrapped up behind me was Sukrad&#x2019;s staff, I wonder what he would think. </span></p><p><span style="">That boss ran back a little while later, his face and clothes filled with perspiration. He looked at me, and clearly heaved a sigh of relief. I said smilingly, &#x201C;What, were you afraid that I was going to run away?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The boss smiled awkwardly before replying, &#x201C;I have gathered the money. Let&#x2019;s go to the Magic Union to do the exchange.&#x201D; (For large transactions, the Magic Union would have to settle it.)</span></p><p><span style="">I followed him to the Magic Union. There was also an notification for my arrest here. Luckily, I was wearing my conical bamboo hat. After I passed the amethyst card to the boss, he was astonished and exclaimed, &#x201C;You have an amethyst card. You must be a famous magician.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">I said coldly, &#x201C;Don&#x2019;t ask any more questions and just quickly do the exchange.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Under my surveillance, the boss transferred 20,000 diamond coins into my account. Haha! I had become rich!</span></p><p><span style="">After returning to the jewel shop, I gave him the purple crystal. As I looked at him, he looked at it as if it was his baby; I wanted to laugh.</span></p><p><span style="">The boss humbly said, &#x201C;Lord Mage, if you have such high-grade magic gemstones in the future, can you sell them to my shop? We will definitely give you a reasonable price.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">I shook my head. &#x201C;I don&#x2019;t think I will. This place is so far away, and I don&#x2019;t know when I will be coming back to this town.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The boss smiled and replied, &#x201C;Our Auspicious Jewel Shop is a chain store. One of our branches can be found in every single city on the eastern continent.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Oh! It was a chain jewelry store.</span></p><p><span style="">The boss took out a card and passed it to me. &#x201C;This is our jewel shops&#x2019; VIP card. If you take it to any of our stores, you will receive preferential treatment.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">I took the yellow card and replied, &#x201C;The cards are graded?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The boss replied, &#x201C;Of course, the VIP card has five grades, and this card is of the highest grade. We will only give it out to important guests.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">I chuckled. &#x201C;I feel really honoured, and look forward to working with you in the future.&#x201D; After I said that, I kept the VIP card.</span></p><p><span style="">The boss had personally walked me out of the jewel store. Judging from his joyful face, I knew that he had greatly profited in this transaction. This chain of jewel stores had become the biggest jewel store in the future due to my frequent visits. Of course, I also acquired from them what I needed for all my expenditures.</span></p><p><span style="">I took out 100 diamond coins to buy some necessities that filled up two big cars before returning to the inn. I had to really thank the generous Dragon people. I wouldn&#x2019;t have to worry about my finances in the future.</span></p><p><span style="">I gave out the necessities to the villagers the next day before we continued to move towards Xiuda.</span></p><p><span style="">We were treated as a mercenaries, and therefore did not encounter too many troubles. We arrived at Pulima City without a hitch. It was at this place where I first learnt about being a mercenary army, and this place was also very near the valley that Big Brother Zhan Hu occupied.</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p>
