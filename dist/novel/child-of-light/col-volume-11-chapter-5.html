<p><b><u>Volume 11: Chapter 5 - Hai Shui Arrives</u></b></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Mu Zi, when you see this letter, I will already be far from the base. You should understand why I&#x2019;m heading out. I must go to protect the world&#x2019;s peace and harmony. I&#x2019;m sorry for leaving without telling you. I know that you will be hurt after learning of my departure. However, I want to tell you that no matter where I am, you&#x2019;ll be following me in my heart. I love you, Mu Zi. I really do. Please take care of yourself. I must obtain the Radiant God&#x2019;s inheritance for everyone, you, and the world. I want you to help everyone resist the Monster race when they appear. We should be able to hold for a while with the strength of our God&#x2019;s Protector Squad. Please help me tell Big Brother Xiu Si that he will be in charge of everything at the base. I also didn&#x2019;t take Xiao Jin along with me to receive the inheritance as it will be better for him to stay here to increase our strength. Mu Zi, I&#x2019;ve already started to miss you, even when I haven&#x2019;t left yet. Please take care, my love. Inscribed by, Zhang Gong Wei.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Mu Zi&#x2019;s tears fell, dampening the letter. She said, dazed, &#x201C;Zhang Gong, you&#x2019;re so silly! Why didn&#x2019;t you tell me that you had to go?&#x201D; She just sat there in a daze feeling the loss from Zhang Gong&#x2019;s departure. </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hey, Mu Zi, where&#x2019;s Zhang Gong?&#x201D; A familiar voice came over.</span></p><p><span style="">Mu Zi momentarily got out from her shock and turned to see that it was Zhan Hu.</span></p><p><span style="">When Zhan Hu saw Mu Zi&#x2019;s tear stained face, he frowned and asked, &#x201C;What happened? Mu Zi, did Zhang Gong bully you? Tell me if he did. I&#x2019;ll help you in punishing him.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Mu Zi shook her head with all her might and her tears involuntarily flowed again. &#x201C;Big Brother Zhan Hu, Zhang Gong&#x2026;he left.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Zhan Hu was so startled that he cried out, &#x201C;What? He left? Where did he go?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Mu Zi suppressed her emotions and replied, &#x201C;He has gone to accept the Radiant God&#x2019;s inheritance. Have a look at this.&#x201D; Upon saying that, she passed the letter in her hand to Zhan Hu.</span></p><p><span style="">After Zhan Hu read through the letter in detail, he fumed. &#x201C;That brat, how can he just leave without a word. I won&#x2019;t forgive him when he gets back.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Mu Zi said, &#x201C;Big Brother Zhan Hu, please don&#x2019;t blame him. I understand his intentions . He did it as he feared everyone would be extremely worried about him when he left. Moreover, he is already gone so it&#x2019;s too late to say anything now.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Zhan Hu scratched his head. &#x201C;We also don&#x2019;t know when he will return. Sigh&#x2026;he really is&#x2026;.. Forget it, let&#x2019;s not talk about this. I&#x2019;ve come to find him as a pretty girl is outside and looking for him. We&#x2019;ve caught her, she&#x2019;s a mage. Her power isn&#x2019;t bad, her name is something like Hai&#x2026;Hai&#x2026;.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Mu Zi exclaimed, &#x201C;Hai Shui?!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Zhan Hu replied, &#x201C;Yes! Yes! She&#x2019;s called Hai Shui. Do you know her?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Mu Zi nodded. &#x201C;Big Brother Zhan Hu, I&#x2019;ll go with you to see her.&#x201D; Mu Zi and Zhan Hu dashed out from Zhang Gong&#x2019;s room after she said that. They crossed the hillside of the God&#x2019;s Protector Domain to the watch post manned by a few soldiers.</span></p><p><span style="">Mu Zi had recognised Hai Shui&#x2019;s blue mage robes from afar. Even though Hai Shui was still beautiful, there were still a lot of changes. Her small face was completely white devoid of &#xA0;blood. The robe on her body was tattered. Her face was a picture of exhaustion as she anxiously waited. She seemed to have suffered greatly on her journey!</span></p><p><span style="">Mu Zi floated over. &#x201C;Hai Shui!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Hai Shui&#x2019;s eyes lit up and quickly jumped towards Mu Zi after recognising her. &#x201C;Sister Mu Zi, I&#x2019;ve finally found you guys. The search was so tough!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Mu Zi embraced Hai Shui&#x2019;s body and caressed her hair. She consoled her, &#x201C;Don&#x2019;t cry, Hai Shui. Why have you come?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Hai Shui used her sleeves to wipe away her tears . &#x201C;Ma Ke had told me about Zhang Gong&#x2019;s news when he returned to the city. I was almost angered to death by Zhang Gong when I read his letter. What did Big Brother Zhang Gong think I am? Could it be that my heart will change once his appearance changed? I already swore long ago that he will be the perfect Big Brother Zhang Gong in my heart, no matter what changes have occurred. I immediately heard from Ma Ke that Big Brother Zhang Gong will be in this mountain range so I hurried over after reading the letter.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Mu Zi&#x2019;s body shuddered as she could understand the deep longing that filled Hai Shui&#x2019;s eyes very well. A girl had suddenly left her homeland to run to such a remote location for Zhang Gong. </span><i><span style="">&#x2018;Zhang Gong! Zhang Gong! It really looks like Hai Shui&#x2019;s feelings aren&#x2019;t inferior to mine.&#x2019;</span></i></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Sister Hai Shui, did you inform your family when you left?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Hai Shui&#x2019;s lovely face reddened before she whispered, &#x201C;I...I snuck out. Your place is really hard to find. It took me two days to enter this mountain range. I finally found this place after much difficulty, but they hindered me.&#x201D; Upon saying that, Hai Shui glared fiercely at the guards at the watch post.</span></p><p><span style="">Mu Zi smiled. &#x201C;Don&#x2019;t blame them as they are just doing their job. Sister, you&#x2019;ve really suffered. Let&#x2019;s head back to my room to rest for a while.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Hai Shui hesitated for a while before looking at Mu Zi&#x2019;s back. She stuttered, &#x201C;Big Sister Mu Zi, where&#x2019;s Big Brother Zhang Gong? Why didn&#x2019;t he come to receive me? Could it be...Could it be that he doesn&#x2019;t want to meet me?&#x201D; Upon saying that, Hai Shui&#x2019;s eye rims reddened again.</span></p><p><span style="">Mu Zi smiled wryly. &#x201C;How can that be? If he knew you&#x2019;d came, he would definitely be the first one to greet you. However, he just left. Take a look at this.&#x201D; Mu Zi passed over the letter in her hand. </span></p><p><span style="">Hai Shui was stunned after reading the letter&#x2019;s contents and said in a daze, &#x201C;I never expected that I would have just missed him after travelling so far.&#x201D; Hai Shui&#x2019;s body slumped and fell towards the ground. Mu Zi hastily supported her body.</span></p><p><span style="">Zhan Hu jumped in shock. &#x201C;What&#x2019;s happened to her? What&#x2019;s going on?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Mu Zi checked on Hai Shui&#x2019;s condition in detail. She finally let out a breath after a long while. &#x201C;Sister Hai Shui has always loved Zhang Gong. You should ask your good brother about the details in the future. There&#x2019;s nothing wrong with Sister Hai Shui. She has just collapsed from the accumulated exhaustion, the cold and being overcome with grief. Big Brother Zhan Hu, let&#x2019;s head back to the base. She&#x2019;ll get better after resting for a while.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Mu Zi sighed inwardly as she carried Hai Shui. </span><i><span style="">&#x2018;Zhang Gong! Zhang Gong! You really picked a good time to leave!&#x2019;</span></i></p><p></p><hr><p></p>
