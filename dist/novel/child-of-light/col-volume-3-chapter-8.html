<p><strong><u>Volume 3: Chapter 8 &#x2013; Encountering Bandits</u></strong></p><p>A short and stout middle aged man walked over, &#x201C;Hello sir, was it you that wanted to use the amethyst card to pay the bill?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;That&#x2019;s right. What&#x2019;s the matter?&#x201D; I lazily answered. I&#x2019;ve eaten my fill, right now my greatest concern was going to bed.</p><p>&#x201C;May I ask you what your profession is?&#x201D; The middle aged man asked with a smile.</p><p>&#x201C;I am a mage. What does this have to do with the meal? Let me pay the bill immediately, I want to go.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;It&#x2019;s like this, the reason why we are called Signature tavern is because every person that eats here either has great ability or a position in society. So long as you write your signature here, you can eat a meal for free.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;So there was such a good thing. Then I&#x2019;ll give you my autograph.&#x201D; Eat a meal without paying, not bad.</p><p>&#x201C;Then what is your mage rank?&#x201D;</p><p>I took out my magic union identification card, &#x201C;Great Mage, is this a high enough rank?&#x201D;</p><p>The shop keeper&#x2019;s face showed a pleasantly surprised smile, &#x201C;That is high enough. Without doubt. Then I will inconvenience you.&#x201D;</p><p>With just a casual signature on the names of four delicious dishes, I was excused from paying for several gold coins worth of food. It seems that the magic identification card has it uses, not bad.</p><p>Later generations testified to the shop owner&#x2019;s wisdom, for the Child of Light&#x2019;s autograph was later auctioned off for 20,000 diamond coins.</p><p>I randomly picked a hotel to stay the night. Tomorrow morning, I&#x2019;ll go to the east city gate. That was where I made an appointment with the strong man yesterday.</p><p>There were a truly great amount of people and great many carriages parked on the roadside. I suppose this is the caravan I&#x2019;m supposed to escort. Isn&#x2019;t that the strong man? From a glance, he looked like he was chatting with a few merchants.</p><p>&#x201C;Hi, I&#x2019;ve come. When are we leaving?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Ah, you came. Let me introduce you. This is the leader of the caravan we are escorting, Mr. Li Ci Meng.&#x201D; He said pointing at a stout merchant. &#x201C;This person is a great mage. Ah that&#x2019;s right. I still don&#x2019;t know your name. My name is Long Meng Hai.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;My name is Zhang Gong Wei. Greetings everyone, I am honored to be escorting you all with Long Meng.&#x201D;</p><p>Mr. Meng looked at me be doubt, &#x201C;You are a great mage?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;That&#x2019;s right, what? Not convinced? Oh great light elements, heed my call, friends. Congregate in front of me, become a holy light annihilating everything.&#x201D; I only displayed my own strength, so that I could take it easy during the journey.</p><p>Following my incantation, my body suddenly dispatched a dazzling white light pushing away everyone within five meters of me.</p><p>&#x201C;If any of you have the slightest knowledge of magic, you should that was a rank six spell.&#x201D; My voice transmitted from within the Holy Light.</p><p>My powerful spell caught the interest of everyone present, and they all gasped with surprise. I withdrew my holy light, &#x201C;With this you should be convinced.&#x201D;</p><p>As expected of a merchant, Mr. Meng immediately walked over with a smile across his face, &#x201C;Excuse us, we shouldn&#x2019;t have doubted you, great mage. With you on this journey, our safety is guaranteed.</p><p>Long Meng also walked over. A moment ago when I released the power of Holy Light, he hadn&#x2019;t been able to resist even the slightest. He said ashamedly, &#x201C;To tell the truth, I had also doubted your abilities at the beginning. Now I know how silly I was. In this escort mission, my mercenary company and I have decided to listen to your orders.</p><p>With everyone flattering me, I got a bit carried away. &#x201C;You don&#x2019;t have to do that. I just didn&#x2019;t want everyone to think I was only here for food, hehe. You&#x2019;ll still be in charge, I don&#x2019;t want to. If something happens, it will be fine to just call for me.&#x201D;</p><p>Like that, the journey had started with me and Long Meng&#x2019;s mercenary company escorting about a hundred merchant carriages.</p><p>Because I had displayed my strength, everyone had treated me with admiration, letting ride in the most luxurious carriage and receiving the best rations during meal time. I also became a freeloader. It seemed that magic was truly not widely learned. Knowing magic had many benefits, not only having to not pay for food at a restaurant but I can also freeload off of the mercenaries, haha.</p><p>My carriage is at the center of the caravan. It is said so that I could look after the entire caravan from front to end. &#xA0;Just when I was about to fall asleep, someone had shook me awake. It was Long Meng. He looked exhausted, his brow beaded with sweat.</p><p>&#x201C;What&#x2019;s the matter?&#x201D; I lazily asked.</p><p>&#x201C;It&#x2019;s bad. It seems we&#x2019;ve come across bandits.&#x201D; Long Meng said nervously.</p><p>&#x201C;That&#x2019;s not possible. There are people that dare to rob such a large caravan?&#x201D; In my mind, I imagined about twenty to thirty bandits.</p><p>&#x201C;We have a large amount of men? Why don&#x2019;t you go out and take a look?&#x201D; Long Meng was clearly a bit nervous.</p><p>It seemed somewhat amiss, I dropped from the carriage, and was stunned by the situation before me. Now I knew why Long Meng had sweated so much, because I had also broke a cold sweat.</p><p>On top of the hills, I saw group of more than three hundred men before me. Such a large bandit group, how did I end up with such terrible luck? I originally believed I could comfortably complete this mission, but it seems this time there&#x2019;s going to be a bit of trouble.</p><p>Long Meng&#x2019;s mercenary company and I came together to the front. The bandit group had arrived in front of us in a flash, and scattered in every direction, creating an impenetrable encirclement.</p><p>&#x201C;Tell your leader to come out and answer.&#x201D; A bandit arrogantly yelled.</p><p>Long Meng, Mr. Meng, and I all looked at each other, who will go? &#xA0;They suddenly pushed me out. This, this is too unjust! But I already came out. Let&#x2019;s take a look. Honestly, to run away by myself is unacceptable. It&#x2019;s possible to flee but I&#x2019;m not that afraid. I walked forward a few steps.</p><p>&#x201C;May I ask how we may help all of you gentlemen?&#x201D; After I asked, the bandits immediately gave an arrogant, heartily laugh.</p><p>&#x201C;Who do you think we are? &#xA0;Leave all of your belongings behind at once and I, your father, will release you. Or else, hehe.&#x201D; Their black battle armored boss said loudly.</p><p>&#x201C;Elder brothers, we all aren&#x2019;t that easy. Won&#x2019;t you let us go?&#x201D; I pleaded.</p><p>&#x201C;Let you go? We waited a month with great difficulty for an attractive, wealthy target and you want us to let you go? What a delusion.&#x201D;</p><p>It looks like it&#x2019;ll be impossible to pass. I was suddenly hit with a bright idea, and recalled what Teacher Di and I had discussed. The people of the Xiuda Kingdom truly value face, especially the pride of a knight. It seemed I can exploit this.</p><p>&#x201C;Excuse me, you, leader, are you a knight?&#x201D; My words were hard and firm, piercing through the leader&#x2019;s black battle armor.</p><p>Before he replied, a bandit viciously said, &#x201C;Of course. Our boss is a heaven knight.&#x201D; That leader wore an obviously proud appearance. Not bad, they fell into my trap.</p><p></p><hr><p></p><p><span style=""><a href="www.wuxiaworld.com">r</a></span></p>
