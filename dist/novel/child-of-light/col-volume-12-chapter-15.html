<p><b><u>Volume 12: Chapter 15 - A Sudden Strange Phenomena</u></b></p><p><span style="">The five of them cried out mournfully as they violently spurt out blood. Their bodies soared and landed heavily to the side and the Holy Sword&#x2019;s boundary shattered. My chest felt as though I had been struck by an enormous hammer from the backlash, forcing me retreat a few steps. I was worried, the five divine wills seemed to be ignorant of what was happening and continued to quickly charge towards the divine instruments. There was a high probability that the brothers wouldn&#x2019;t be able to currently withstand the enormous divine powers, leading to the destruction of their bodies.</span></p><p><span style="">At this critical moment, the Ice God&#x2019;s mask let out faint white light. My mind seemed to have been electrified, forcefully clearing my mind. I hastily brandished the Holy Sword with my hand and formed an arc to block the five light balls from entering their divine weapons. With a wave of my left hand, it rapidly sealed the five divine wills and returned them to my space pocket once again.</span></p><p><span style="">My heart sank. Who could easily break through the Holy Sword&#x2019;s boundary and simultaneously hurt the five of them? &#x2026; Of course, the one and only ruler of the Monster race, the one who would bring carnage to the world, the Monster King. I never expected that he could so accurately deduce the most crucial time to strike.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hai Shui, why did you do that?&#x201D; Mu Zi cried out. But when I looked at her, the beautiful and gentle Hai Shui had changed. Her hair was no longer a bright blue, but had turned greyish blue. Her eyes was constantly glimmered with red light. Her icy gaze held no feelings toward me. </span><i><span style="">&#x2018;Could it be that the previous grey light was from her?&#x2019;</span></i></p><p><span style="">Hai Shui snorted and with a casual wave of her hand, Mu Zi, who was nearing the Magister realm, was sent flying to heavily strike against a wall.</span></p><p><span style="">Apart from Hai Shui, I was the only one left standing. I held the Holy Sword in front of my body and asked fumingly, &#x201C;Hai Shui, do you even know what you are doing?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Hai Shui broke into laughter. Her voice was no longer melodious and moving. Her tone was neither sinister nor normal, &#x201C;Human, you&#x2019;re really idiotic. There&#x2019;s only one outcome for going against my Monster race, death. Brat, do you really think you can fight against me using Mi Jia Lie&#x2019;s power? To me, Mi Jia Lie was nothing more than another fragile life. He was surmount to nothing. Not bad! Not bad! I can eliminate the hope of that old fellow, the God King, today. Afterwards, I shall see what he can still use to resist me. When this world falls into my hand, it will be the demise of the God&#x2019;s Realm. Hahahahaha!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">I looked dazedly at Hai Shui, who looked crazed, and said with a deep hatred, &#x201C;You&#x2019;re the Monster King.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Hai Shui&#x2019;s laughter stopped abruptly. &#x201C;That&#x2019;s right! I&#x2019;m the ruler that governs everything, the great Monster King. No matter what, you&#x2019;ll fall to my Monster race&#x2019;s feet. You understood too late.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Why? Why did Hai Shui become the Monster King? I couldn&#x2019;t wrap my head around it. Seeing Zhan Hu and the rest still unconscious, I felt my heart as it ripped to pieces. I hollered as I brandished the Radiant Holy Sword, shooting a silver streak towards the Monster King.</span></p><p><span style="">Hai Shui chuckled disdainfully. &#x201C;I&#x2019;ve already told you that Mi Jia Lie&#x2019;s ability isn&#x2019;t worthy of my attention. You still want to fight me? You&#x2019;re really too naive.&#x201D; She raised her right hand to physically block the Holy Sword&#x2019;s divine light ray. The enormous backlash flung my body high in the air before colliding against the courtyard wall. He held such tyrannical, strong power!</span></p><p><span style="">The Monster King looked at his arm. &#x201C;This body is not bad. It&#x2019;s perfect. With this vessel, I can bring out a sufficient amount of power to annihilate every life form in the world.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">I used the Holy Sword to support my body as I slowly stood. &#x201C;Why? How could you possess Hai Shui&#x2019;s body?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The Monster King looked coldly at me. &#x201C;Since you&#x2019;re about to die, it won&#x2019;t matter if I tell you that. To you humans, everyone has desires, which is what I like the most. That little girl Hai Shui&#x2019;s desire was extremely intense, so strong that I couldn&#x2019;t help myself in making her my new vessel. Do you know what her desire was? It&#x2019;s to receive your love. </span><i><span style="">Haha</span></i><span style="">! How laughable? Too hilarious. Love is nothing, and yet she was willing to sacrifice her life for it.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">My heart trembled. Even though I knew Hai Shui had deep feelings for me, I didn&#x2019;t expect it to be so great. </span><i><span style="">&#x2018;Hai Shui, it&#x2019;s all my fault. If I had accepted you in the first place, you wouldn&#x2019;t have been possessed by the Monster King.&#x2019;</span></i><span style=""> Fury filled my chest. I no longer cared about anything. I just wanted to raise the Holy Sword. Suddenly, I saw happiness in the Monster King&#x2019;s eyes. Happiness? What was he excited about? He held an absolute advantage now, he shouldn&#x2019;t need to be happy about it. The Ice God&#x2019;s mask sent an electric shock through my mind, once again clearing it. I instantly understood, no matter how powerful he was, he still must have a weak point. An invader like himself shouldn&#x2019;t need to talk to me so much, he could just kill me directly. His previous words were to provoke me. What was his purpose? Could it be that he didn&#x2019;t have enough power to deal with me? It couldn&#x2019;t be, his power was over three times more than mine, so naturally I wasn&#x2019;t his match. What was it then?</span></p><p><span style="">While I couldn&#x2019;t make a decision, I saw a look of conflict in the Monster King&#x2019;s eyes! &#x2018;</span><i><span style="">I get it! He must not be able to completely possess Hai Shui&#x2019;s body. Hai Shui loves me so she wouldn&#x2019;t have any killing intent towards me. The Monster King wants to use my hatred of him to make Hai Shui think I hate her, and thus using that to kill me. That&#x2019;s it! That must be the case.</span></i><span style="">&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">Thinking about that, under the astonishment of the Monster King, I lowered the Radiant Holy Sword as I said gently towards the Monster King, &#x201C;Hai Shui, awaken, chase that devil from your body. I love you. I really do! You want to experience a peaceful life with me, right?&#x201D;</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p>
