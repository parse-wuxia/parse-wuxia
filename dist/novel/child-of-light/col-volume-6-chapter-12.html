<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>Volume 6: Chapter 12 - Xiao Jin&apos;s Family</strong></span></p><p><span style="">As I faced the world&#x2019;s strongest expert, the Dragon King, I didn&#x2019;t dare to slight him. I bowed towards him and said, &#x201C;Dragon King, I thank you for saving me.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The dragon King replied, &#x201C;I didn&#x2019;t do much. It is my clan member that hurt you, so I definitely have the responsibility of saving you. From what I&#x2019;ve heard from my child, you have been taking care of him all this time, right?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">I nodded. &#x201C;It cannot be said that I took care of him. Xiao Jin is my best friend. He has experienced many life and death dangers with me. Without him, I would be dead already.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The old Dragon King nodded. &#x201C;I want you to explain to me why my child&#x2019;s life force is this weak.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">My expression dampened and sighed, &#x201C;To tell you the truth, this was due to my&#x2026;.&#x201D; I told him everything that had transpired.</span></p><p><span style="">When the green and white dragon heard that I let Xiao Jin out to compete, even after I was warned not to, they glared at me until I said I used my life to save Xiao Jin. Only then did they calm down a little. The old Dragon King heard what I said emotionlessly.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;.....So that was what happened that resulted in Xiao Jin&#x2019;s life force being so weak. I came here to return him to your side. I hope you can find a way to recover his life force.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Xiao Jin loudly cried out. It was obvious that he didn&#x2019;t want to be separated from me.</span></p><p><span style="">I glanced at him, full with emotion, and lukewarmly said, &#x201C;Xiao Jin, this is your home. You must listen to your parents from now on and qualify to become a great Dragon King, alright?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Xiao Jin strongly shook his head and said in my heart, &#x201C;I want to follow you. I don&#x2019;t want to stay here.&#x201D; After being together for so many years, Xiao Jin was filled with reluctance to part from me.</span></p><p><span style="">I walked over and leaned on his body. With tears flowing down my face, I replied, &#x201C;I am also reluctant to leave you. However, this is your world. You have your family, and they&#x2019;re the same species as you. You will only be in danger if you follow me.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">XIao Jin cried out to the old Dragon King and used his big wings to place me at the center of his body.</span></p><p><span style="">The old Dragon King said, &#x201C;Human, I don&#x2019;t know if I should thank you for returning my child or to blame you for the great loss of his life force. I will count it as the balance between contribution and errors. You are free to go. Xiao Qing, you send him out.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">I nodded and struggled out of Xiao Jin&#x2019;s embrace. I deeply bowed towards the old Dragon King. &#x201C;Thank you for not punishing me. I hope that after I leave, you can recover Xiao Jin&#x2019;s life force. Xiao Jin&#x2019;s previous death is the most remorseful incident in my entire life.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The huge white dragon replied, &#x201C;We will.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Xiao Jin was restricted by the old Dragon King&#x2019;s power. He repeatedly cried out and was filled with reluctance. The old Dragon King looked at my fading back before gently sighing.</span></p><p><span style="">Just as I was going to walk out of the hole, the old Dragon King&#x2019;s imposing voice called out.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Human, come back here.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">I was stunned as to why he wanted me back. Could it be he didn&#x2019;t know how much determination it took for me to leave Xiao Jin? However, with the call from the Dragon King, I couldn&#x2019;t disobey it.</span></p><p><span style="">After returning to face the Dragon King, Xiao Jin was already no longer there. The dragon King lukewarmly said, &#x201C;I have already locked Xiao Jin up in a secret room. After settling your matters, I will start to help him recover his life force.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">I gratifyingly replied, &#x201C;Thank you. I will be happy if Xiao Jin is alright.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The Dragon King said smilingly, &#x201C;He&#x2019;s my child. I will definitely treat him. I should be the one to thanking you. Even though my child has lost a large amount of life force, he is still brought back here safely by you. If you have any request, you can say them. I will try my best to fulfill them.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">I lowered my head and thought before suddenly saying, &#x201C;I do not have any request for myself, but I want to plead to you to help save the other races in the world.&#x201D; I thought, </span><i><span style="">&#x201C;If I can involve this old Dragon King in the battle, I will feel more relieved when the time comes.&#x201D;</span></i></p><p><span style="">The Dragon King looked interested and replied, &#x201C; Carry on.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">I composed myself before telling him what the God King had told me previously. After the Dragon King heard what I had to say, he sighed deeply and said, &#x201C;You&#x2019;re a good child. You are kindhearted. Actually, I already know everything. We have the same enemy, the Monster&#xA0;King. You perhaps don&#x2019;t about this, but during that year of the great God and Monster&#xA0;war my father had led the dragon clan to also participate in it.&#x201D; Here, the old Dragon King&#x2019;s eyes were filled with dejection.</span></p><p><span style="">He continued to say, &#x201C;My father, the previous generation&apos;s Dragon King, was killed by the Monster&#xA0;King. From then on, I inherited the Dragon King&#x2019;s position. The God King once told me that even with his God&#x2019;s power, he was still unable to eliminate the Monster&#xA0;King. There will be a day the Monster&#xA0;King will emerge again. However, at that time, a hero that has a short life, the Child of Light, will lead all of the brave warriors to have the ultimate battle against the Monster&#xA0;King.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">I was startled and replied, &#x201C;It can&#x2019;t be that Child of Light that has a short life is me, right?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The Dragon King nodded. &#x201C;That&#x2019;s correct. It is you. If you aren&#x2019;t that person, why would the God King give you the Holy Sword? Child, there are some matters that you won&#x2019;t be able to escape from. Do you understand?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">I smiled embarrassedly, &#x201C;Even if I want to escape, will I be able to? You can stop worrying. I will do my best.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The old Dragon King noded. &#x201C;Child, I have already recovered your life force that you sacrificed for my child and also strengtheedn your bones. Your path is still an extremely long one.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">This was not bad. It was worth the trip. It had actually recovered my life force. This was just too amazing. </span><i><span style="">Haha!</span></i></p><p><span style="">I said with gratitude, &#x201C;Thank you for recovering my life force.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The old Dragon King shook his head. &#x201C;After a couple of years, I will lead the eight elders of the dragon clan to participate in the great God and Monster&#xA0;war in the future. You can be reassured of that. If the Monster King wants to invade the whole world, he will definitely not let my clan off.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">I respectfully nodded. &#x201C;I represent the human race of the world to thank you beforehand.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The old Dragon King replied, &#x201C;My child&#x2019;s dependence on you is very strong. I know that you two will be inseparable partners in life. I will not forcefully keep you two apart. However, I have some conditions that you must agree to.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">I instantly became elated. I didn&#x2019;t want to be separated from Xiao Jin. This was too perfect.</span></p><p><span style="">I hastily replied, &#x201C;Please state your terms. As long as I can be with Xiao Jin, I will accept any conditions.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The Dragon King chuckled and replied, &#x201C;I have three conditions. The first is that you must protect the safety of my child and not let him be fatally wounded.&#x201D;</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p>
