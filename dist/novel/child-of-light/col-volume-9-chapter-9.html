Her beautiful large eyes were teary as she gave a pleading look.</span></p><p><span style="">I asked, &#x201C;You have done many malicious things. Why do you feel wronged if I kill you?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The demon beast unexpectedly shook her head with all her might. It was as though I really had wronged her. Su He said, &#x201C;Hmm, she seems to have something she wants to say.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Zhan Hu said, &#x201C;What else can she say? She is just seeking forgiveness. Zhang Gong, kill her. We&#x2019;ve to carry on our journey.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Seeing her beautiful large eyes, my heart softened. I relaxed the light halo that was restricting her. &#x201C;If you want to run away, I&#x2019;ll make sure you die without an intact body. I&#x2019;ll give you a chance to explain yourself.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The Demon fox called out mournfully before a magic undulation appeared in her body, transforming her to the form we initially saw her in. Her exceptionally captivating body figure still made my heart race. I bit the tip of my tongue and said, &#x201C;If you&#x2019;re trying to charm us again, I won&#x2019;t be that polite anymore.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The demon fox quickly replied, &#x201C;No, no! I wouldn&#x2019;t dare.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">I replied, &#x201C;Just say what you want to tell us. I don&#x2019;t have spare time for you to dawdle.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The demon fox looked at me pitifully. &#x201C;I&#x2019;m just an ordinary Demon Fox that unintentionally gained intelligence and learned the cultivation method that you call evolution. However, even though my body needs blood, I have never killed anybody.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">I coldly snorted, &#x201C;Your words are hard to believe as you were able to cultivate to this standard yet you haven&#x2019;t killed anybody.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The demon fox replied, &#x201C;What I said is the truth. Lord, even though I eat the essence of the demon race, every time I had met a demon, I just make them unconscious and take a little bit of blood from each. I&#x2019;ve never killed anyone in the process of supplying my body with blood.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">I looked at Su He and asked, &#x201C;Is what she said possible?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Su He nodded. &#x201C;From the looks of it, she doesn&#x2019;t seem to be lying as there aren&#x2019;t any black lines at her upper dantian. She shouldn&#x2019;t have killed anybody before.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">I thought before I replied, &#x201C;Since you haven&#x2019;t killed anybody, I&#x2019;ll let you go this time. You should be more careful the next time you hunt for food. You&#x2019;re free to go.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The Demon Fox continuously kowtowed to me while thanking me profusely. I waved my hand and shot a power to lift her up. I said, &#x201C;That&#x2019;s enough. You just have to not kill any people in the future. That is the best way to show your gratitude towards me.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The Demon Fox whispered to me, &#x201C;My lord, may I ask you a favour?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">I didn&#x2019;t kill her was already not bad already. Now, she wanted me to grant her a favour? I impatiently replied, &#x201C;Say it!&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">The Demon Fox cautiously replied, &#x201C;I wish to travel with you.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">I was so shocked that I almost jumped up before loudly rejecting her.</span></p><p><span style="">The Demon Fox&#x2019;s tears flowed down as she cried, &#x201C;I didn&#x2019;t kill any of the Demon Race, not to mention any humans. Please accept me.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">I replied, &#x201C;This is different from you killing or not killing anybody. I can&#x2019;t bring you along, you should just stay here and cultivate.&#x201D; It would be a joke to bring her along. With her swaying in front of me, I might do something that would let Mu Zi and Hai Shui down. We were a bunch of hot blooded fellows.</span></p><p><span style="">Su He suddenly whispered to the demon fox, &#x201C;How can he let you to follow you in your current form? Change into your other form.&#x201D; The demon fox was suddenly enlightened and immediately transformed into a cute single tailed demon fox before jumping into my embrace and continuously licking my face.</span></p><p><span style="">I glared at Su He. &#x201C;What are you thinking? Why did you make her follow me?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Su He said smilingly, &#x201C;You don&#x2019;t know about this but to her kind of fox species, her inborn talent isn&#x2019;t good so to be able to train to her current state, it should have been really difficult. If she wants to have another breakthrough, she&#x2019;ll definitely need the protection of God&#x2019;s power or have a lot of believers that pray towards her. The latter is definitely impossible but for the former, isn&#x2019;t it you? Your body must have some kind of God&#x2019;s power that had resulted in her wanting to follow you so badly.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Hearing what &#xA0;Su He said, the demon fox strongly nodded her head, indicating her full approval.</span></p><p><span style="">I tossed the demon fox to Big Brother Zhan Hu. &#x201C;Big brother, you also have God&#x2019;s power so she should be yours. She can even transform into a beauty.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The furry thing landed in Zhan Hu&#x2019;s embrace, making him jump in fright. After hearing what I said, he angrily replied, &#x201C;Zhang Gong! You brat, you don&apos;t speak your feelings. No, I shall leave the beauty with you.&#x201D; He just tossed the demon fox back to me. Just as I wanted to toss her to Dong Ri, I suddenly saw that she began tearing up again. I sighed and said, &#x201C;Alright! You can follow me from now on. But don&#x2019;t you dare play any tricks on me. If you do, I&#x2019;ll abandon you. Most importantly, without my permission, you&#x2019;re not allowed to change into your seductive form at your will. Do you understand?&#x201D; I had no choice; who called me to be this kind hearted. I would just give her to Mu Zi as a present in the future.</span></p><p><span style="">An elated radiance was expressed in the demon fox&#x2019;s eyes as she constantly nodded her head in happiness.</span></p><p><span style="">Our task hadn&#x2019;t been completed and we already had two more members.</span></p><p><span style="">Thanks to the commotion with the demon fox, everyone felt a little hungry. I asked Su He, &#x201C;Didn&#x2019;t you say that there were demon beasts in the mountain forest? Why haven&#x2019;t we seen any, other than this demon fox?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Su He smiled embarrassedly before he said, &#x201C;Meeting a demon beast is mostly by chance. It isn&#x2019;t something that will be there just by wishing for it.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">The demon fox suddenly jumped up from my shoulder and ran to the front of us before crouching. Her entire body emitted a fishy urine smell. I was stunned before I asked, &#x201C;What&#x2019;s she doing? Crapping?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">At that moment, there was suddenly a </span><i><span style="">&#x2018;Sha</span></i><span style="">! </span><i><span style="">Sha</span></i><span style="">!&#x2019; sound in the thicket. Zhan Hu shouted, &#x201C;Everyone, be careful. There maybe a demon beast.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">As expected, there was a huge dog-like demon beast that pounced over at the demon fox. The demon fox nimbly jumped onto the demon beast&#x2019;s back. She pierced the thorns of her tail into the back of the demon beast, making it wobble in pain before it collapsed onto the ground.</span></p><p><span style="">That fishy urine smell instantly disappeared afterwards. Dong Ri said in amazement, &#x201C;So, the reason for the smell was so that she could catch a demon beast for us.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The demon fox used her front claws to point at the dog-like demon beast before calling out complacently. Su He walked over and said, &#x201C;</span><i><span style="">Ah! </span></i><span style="">It&#x2019;s a D ranked demon wolf. We can eat this.&#x201D; The demon fox jumped back onto my shoulder and used her big tail to sweep at me as she called out intimately.</span></p><p><span style="">I chuckled and said, &#x201C;I didn&#x2019;t know that you little thing was so capable. Not bad, I&#x2019;ll remember your achievement. Big brother, didn&#x2019;t you say that you know how to cook? We&#x2019;ll test your skills later.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Zhan Hu replied beamingly, &#x201C;No problem. It seems that there&#x2019;s the sound of flowing water to the left side in front of us. Let&#x2019;s head over there.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Jian Shan dragged the demon wolf and everyone headed to where Zhan Hu pointed. A small water spring was seen in front of us, just as we expected. Zhan Hu complacently said, &#x201C;How is it? My experiences are great, right?&#x201D;</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p>
