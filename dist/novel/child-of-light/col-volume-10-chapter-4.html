<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><b>Volume 10: Chapter&#xA0;4 - God&apos;s Emissary</b></span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Did they also receive God&#x2019;s inheritance?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">I nodded.</span></p><p><span style="">Shan Yun sighed. &#x201C;The task that you&#x2019;re shouldering is extremely important. Work hard! When should I bring you all to meet my father?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">A voice came from behind us. &#x201C;Let&#x2019;s head there now. Since I&#x2019;m back, I should at least meet up with that old fellow.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">I turned my head and saw that Big Brother Zhan Hu and the others had come out.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Second brother, where&#x2019;s eldest brother?&#x201D; Zhan Hu asked.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Our eldest brother is on standby on the frontline. The two of us can&#x2019;t return at the same time, as someone must be at the front to keep a lookout.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Zhan Hu nodded. &#x201C;Let&#x2019;s go see our father now. Zhang Gong, you and I should head there. The princess should stay for now. Second brother, Zhang Gong should have told you everything about us, right?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Shan Yun replied, &#x201C;He did. You know father&#x2019;s temper. Whether this is successful or not will entirely depend on your eloquence. I&#x2019;ll try my best to help you out. I hope that with your God&#x2019;s inheritor&#x2019;s identity, you&#x2019;ll be able to convince him.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">I said to Mu Zi, &#x201C;Princess, I&#x2019;ll have to trouble you and Brother Ke to wait here with the other brothers. We will meet up with the prince first. Once we get his support, we&#x2019;ll then have hope in succeeding in our mission.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Mu Zi obediently nodded. &#x201C;Be careful in everything you do, and come back soon.&#x201D; Seeing her attitude as though she was exhorting her husband, I looked at Ke Lun Duo, who looked as though nothing had happened. I then nodded, turned around, and walked out with Big Brother Shan Yun and Zhan Hu.</span></p><p><span style="">After leaving the prince&#x2019;s manor, I asked, &#x201C;Where is the prince at now? Is he not coming back to the manor?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Shan Yun sighed. &#x201C;Seeing how tense the current situation is, how could my father have returned? He is keeping a constant lookout on the commander division. Don&#x2019;t worry, my father has his resting area. We&#x2019;ll head there to meet him.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">I said, all smiles, &#x201C;Why should I worry? Who would be able to recognize me now?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Zhan Hu said, &#x201C;That&#x2019;s right, second brother. Are there any good doctors here who could take a look at Zhang Gong? Those scars have affected him greatly.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Before Shan Yun could reply, I cut in, &#x201C;It&#x2019;s unnecessary now. We should settle the main issue first.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Shan Yun glanced at Zhan Hu, then told me, &#x201C;I&#x2019;ll look for a doctor tomorrow. The three kingdoms&#x2019; best doctors are gathered here.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">I smiled wordlessly.</span></p><p><span style="">On the way to the commander division, I discovered that the </span><span style="">Str&#xF6;m Fortress wasn&#x2019;t filled with only soldiers and mages. There were also many peddlers, of all kinds and shapes. The majority of them sold goods for consumption, armor, weaponry, etc. I asked in astonishment, &#x201C;Big brother Shan Yun, why are the people here selling weapons and armours? Can they make a business here?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Of course, there&#x2019;s profit for them. Who would be willing to do business for little profit? You should know that it has already been a few hundred years since we last fought in a war. The few hundred years of peace have greatly weakened the three Kingdoms&#x2019; battle power and war supply reserves. There are times where we don&#x2019;t have a choice but to buy from the peddlers, which means a market had been established. Currently, magic crystals, bows and arrows are most in demand. Our three kingdoms&#x2019; fighting power is much inferior to the demon&#x2019;s and beast&#x2019;s alliance. If it wasn&#x2019;t for the </span><span style="">Str&#xF6;m Fortress, the eastern continent would have already </span><span style="">fallen into enemy hands. This is one of the main reasons why I support you in trying to negotiate with them.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Seeing that the situation was so strained, my resolution to prepare the negotiation increased.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Take a look, that&#x2019;s the commander division.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Looking in the direction that Shan Yun pointed to, one had to wonder whether this this was really a commander&#x2019;s division. It simply looked just like a castle. When compared to the interim prince&#x2019;s manor, they were as different as the heavens and earth.</span></p><p><span style="">The commander&#x2019;s division was arranged just like the Royal Palace in the Demon&#x2019;s Royal city. If the commander&#x2019;s division was the inner palace, the entire </span><span style="">Str&#xF6;m Fortress would be the outer palace. The commander division was surrounded with lofty city walls, and was being defended by a large group of armed forces. Even though I couldn&#x2019;t see the interior, I could imagine that the construction would be magnificent.</span></p><p><span style="">Seeing my dumbstruck look, Shan Yun said, smilingly, &#x201C;You&#x2019;re shocked, right? I was also shocked when I first came here. After a while, I found out that there&#x2019;s a purpose in building it this way. Even if the </span><span style="">Str&#xF6;m Fortress were to be broken through, with the defence of the commander&#x2019;s division, it would definitely be able to hold for quite a long time. The design of the Str&#xF6;m Fortress is extremely meticulous. You&#x2019;ll discover that in the future, the Str&#xF6;m Fortress won&apos;t &#xA0;be fortified. Do you know why?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">At first I was stunned, but then my thoughts turned around quickly. In a moment, I understood the key reason for this. Unruffled, I replied, &#x201C;It should be due to the possibility that the demons and beasts could occupy it, right?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Shan Yun replied, with praise, &#x201C;That&#x2019;s right. If we had large quantities of magic crystals, no matter how many Demons and beasts there were, we wouldn&#x2019;t need to fear them. However, currently, we can&#x2019;t afford to do that. Even if we were to purchase them for high prices, from the entire eastern continent, it wouldn&#x2019;t be able to satisfy the demands of the </span><span style="">Str&#xF6;m Fortress.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">I became apprehensive. I hadn&#x2019;t known that the demand for magic crystal was that high. Even though I had lots of magic crystals for the negotiation, I couldn&#x2019;t take them out. If not, once the human race was in power, how could they still agree to negotiate with the Demon race?!&#x3000;&#x3000;</span></p><p><span style="">Whilst chatting, we had already reached the moat outside of the commander&#x2019;s division. After stepping on the drawbridge, the surrounding soldiers respectfully said, &#x201C;Greetings to Lord Shan Yun.&#x201D; A commander&#x2019;s aura unconsciously radiated from Shan Yun&#x2019;s body. After saying &#x2018;</span><i><span style="">En!</span></i><span style="">&#x2019; in acknowledgement, he led us into the commander&#x2019;s division.</span></p><p><span style="">Even though I had made mental preparations, I was still startled after I walked into the commander&#x2019;s division. The interior was filled with layered blockhouses. Each and every construction was made from heavy granites. It could be said it was flawless in defence.</span></p><p><span style="">Shan Yun pointed at an enormous stone house in the center. &#x201C;That&#x2019;s the genuine commander&#x2019;s division. We&#x2019;ll discuss any important matters in there. My father&apos;s resting quarters are in that stone room at the side.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The entrance to the prince&#x2019;s resting stone room was guarded by eight soldiers. Shan Yun took the lead and walked forth before asking, &#x201C;Is my father in?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The leader of the soldiers replied respectfully, &#x201C;The prince and Lord Lei Yun are inside.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Zhan Hu said, pleasantly surprised, &#x201C;It&#x2019;s great that eldest brother is here as well. Let&#x2019;s quickly enter.&#x201D; Upon saying that, he took the lead and charged in. Since we had come with Shan Yun, the guards didn&#x2019;t stop him. </span></p><p><span style="">Shan Yun dragged me along, saying, &#x201C;Let&#x2019;s head in as well. Look at your big brother, he&#x2019;s just like a child in a grown-up&#x2019;s body.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The stone house was arranged in a simple and unadorned fashion. There was a large bed, a study table and a few chairs in the room. There was also a four meter dragon gun hanging on the wall, slanted. Big Brother Zhan Hu&#x2019;s tall build blocked my sight, making it impossible for me to look at the prince&#x2019;s appearance. </span></p><p><span style="">However, I noticed that there was a tall and sturdy person beside him. That person unexpectedly looked more ferocious than Zhan Hu, who was two meters tall. His shoulders were broad, and he had a tough and stocky build. He wore a black warrior robe, with a long sword attached to his waist. He had brows like double-edged swords and tiger-like eyes. His nose was straight, and his jaws squared, giving him an extremely mighty appearance.</span></p><p><span style=""> I knew he had to be a valiant general on the battlefield. There wasn&#x2019;t a need for an introduction, as I recognized him from his appearance. He had to be Zhan Hu&#x2019;s eldest brother----Lei Yun.</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p>
