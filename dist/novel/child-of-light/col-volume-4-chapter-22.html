<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>Volume 4: Chapter 22 - Two Tender Encounters</strong></span></p><p><span style="">I woke up early in the morning and started moving my body to warm up before circulating the Ascending Dragon&#x2019;s Battle Spirit that Zhan Hu had taught me. My battle spirit had improved a lot without me noticing. After putting in lots of effort, I managed to hover above the ground. The battle spirit rapidly rushed out from under my feet. I was really surprised that I could levitate, even though I could only maintain it for five minutes. It was just too awesome! &#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">My mood was slightly better. When I entered the classroom, it was that old mage&#x2019;s lesson. I sat in my seat without even glancing at Mu Zi.</span></p><p><span style="">The old mage said, &#x201C;I&#x2019;ll start class now. The results for yesterday&#x2019;s test are out. Overall, everyone did well and passed, but some students passed using dishonest methods. I hope you know that laziness won&#x2019;t lead to any good fortune. Alright! Today I will be teaching&#x2026;&#x201D; &#xA0;</span></p><p><i><span style="">&#x2018;It&#x2019;s obvious he&#x2019;s talking about me but I&#x2019;ll just ignore him now that the test is over.&#x2019;</span></i></p><p><span style="">Mu Zi nudged my side and whispered, &#x201C;Are you still angry?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">I replied flatly, &#x201C;I&#x2018;m not angry. Why should I be? You were right that I&#x2019;m nothing to you so how could I be mad at you?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Mu Zi replied, &#x201C;You&#x2019;re so petty!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">I replied angrily, &#x201C;I&#x2018;m petty? You spent eighty of my diamonds coins just yesterday.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Mu Zi&#x2019;s face reddened and said sheepishly, &#x201C;Then you&#x2019;re not petty, so can we eat at that place for lunch again?&#x201D; </span><i><span style="">&#x2018;Eat there again? I&#x2019;ll be bankrupt in less than a month at this rate.&#x2019;</span></i></p><p><span style="">I replied angrily, &#x201C;I don&#x2019;t feel like eating so I&#x2019;m not going.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Mu Zi pouted and said, &#x201C;I knew you wouldn&#x2019;t go there again. You&#x2019;re just like the other guys who tried to court me.&#x201D; After she said that, she lowered her head dejectedly.</span></p><p><span style="">I relented and said, &#x201C;Fine, then we&#x2019;ll go eat at noon.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Mu Zi&#x2019;s eyes brightened after hearing that, but then she became depressed again. &#x201C;I think we shouldn&#x2019;t go since you&#x2019;ll have to spend so much. I don&#x2019;t know why I have this bad habit of loving to eat so much.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">I was moved by her pitiful look, and said, &#x201C;This can&#x2019;t be a bad habit if you&#x2019;re not stealing or robbing. It&#x2019;s just eating food so stop being so dejected. We&#x2019;ll go there at noon.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Mu Zi started to tear up. &#x201C;Zhang Gong, you&#x2019;re so good. Thank you so much! What shall we have for lunch?&#x201D; After she asked that, her eyes brightened.</span></p><p><span style="">I laughed bitterly in my heart as I couldn&#x2019;t be stingy. &#x201C;It&#x2019;ll be up to you. We&#x2019;ll eat whatever you want.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Mu Zi exclaimed, &#x201C;Yay!&#x201D; &#x2018;</span><i><span style="">Even though I am about to spend some huge sum of diamond coins, my mood is surprisingly better.&#x2019;</span></i></p><p><span style="">I whispered to her. &#x201C;If you agree to be my girlfriend, I&#x2019;ll bring you out to eat everyday!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Mu Zi looked at me and said, &#x201C;Are you really going to bring me out to eat everyday?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">I replied, &#x201C;Yes!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Mu Zi said, &#x201C;Alright! I&#x2019;ll temporarily be your girlfriend, but you have to keep your word!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">I pounded my chest. &#x201C;Of course! As a gentlemen, how could I go back on my word?&#x201D; &#x2018;</span><i><span style="">It seems that bringing her out for food was more effective than giving her love letters.&#x2019; </span></i><span style="">Just as I thought that, Mu Zi said, &#x201C;I have a condition, though, before I agree to be your girlfriend. You still have to write love letters to me every day.&#x201D;</span></p><p><i><span style="">&#x2018;Ah</span></i><span style="">! </span><i><span style="">it seems she is just as vain as other girls.&#x2019;</span></i><span style=""> &#x201C;No problem! I&#x2019;ll start to write one for you now.&#x201D; I took a piece of paper out and hurriedly wrote on it. My heart was filled with feelings for her and I finished writing her love letter extremely quickly. As for the contents, they were as corny as they could be.</span></p><p><span style="">Mu Zi contentedly read the love letter. She repeatedly showed a bashful expression on her blushing small face. </span></p><p><span style="">After reading the letter, she stretched a hand out to me. I was stunned and replied, &#x201C;What do you want?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Mu Zi replied, &#x201C;Please give me the love letters you already wrote for me. I know you kept them.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">I consented, saying, &#x201C;They&#x2019;re in the dormitory. I&#x2019;ll give them to you at noon.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">After morning classes, we went to </span><span style="">Ascending Jade Tide again</span><span style="">. It was so painful! Even though Mu Zi was more reserved in her orders, it was still fifty diamond coins after the discount.</span><i><span style=""> &#x2018;If this continues on, one day I will definitely be coming here to wash the dishes!&#x2019;</span></i></p><p><span style="">After Mu Zi agreed to be my girlfriend, her attitude toward me changed. She occasionally showed shy expressions, and didn&#x2019;t rebuke me as she had before. I was elated.</span></p><p><span style="">When we returned for the afternoon lessons, Mu Zi was, for the first time, not focusing in class; because she was reading the letters that I had written for her before.</span><i><span style=""> &#x2018;It looks like my relationship has finally gotten off to a good start and she is starting to accept me.&#x2019; &#xA0;</span></i></p><p><span style="">When it was close to the end of class, Mu Zi asked, &#x201C;Let&#x2019;s eat at the canteen tonight?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">I replied, &#x201C;Great! I haven&#x2019;t eaten with you at the canteen before.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">When class ended, we went to the canteen. There weren&#x2019;t many students as the ones not in the dormitory usually headed home to eat. We found a quiet spot and ordered some dishes and ate them in great pleasure. </span></p><p><span style="">As I ate, I asked Mu Zi, &#x201C;Mu Zi, how can you not get fat after eating so much everyday?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Mu Zi glanced at me and said, &#x201C;How have I not gained weight? I&#x2019;m much fatter than before.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">I replied, &#x201C;Really? I can&#x2019;t see it. I think it would be better if you were slightly fatter.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">At this moment, a gentle voice said. &#x201C;So you&#x2019;re eating here, Zhang Gong.&#x201D; I turned around and saw Hai Shui.</span></p><p><span style="">I curiously asked, &#x201C;Aren&#x2019;t you supposed to eat your dinner at home? Why are you at the canteen?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Hai Shui walked to my side, but didn&#x2019;t reply to my question. She frowned at Mu Zi. &#x201C;Zhang Gong, why are you with Mu Zi? Mu Zi, how are you?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Mu Zi smiled politely and replied, &#x201C;So it&#x2019;s Hai Shui! Let&#x2019;s eat together!&#x201D; </span><i><span style="">&#x2018;I wonder why she isn&#x2019;t curious about how Hai Shui knows me.&#x2019;</span></i></p><p><span style="">Hai Shui placed her hands on my shoulders and smiled towards Mu Zi. &#x201C;Are you and Zhang Gong familiar enough with each other to be eating together?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Mu Zi replied shyly, &#x201C;How can I be familiar with him? We&#x2019;re just classmates.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">I frowned and said angrily, &#x201C;Mu Zi, how can you still be like that? Didn&#x2019;t you agreed to be my girlfriend this morning?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Mu Zi smiled. &#x201C;Why are you angry again? I&#x2019;m only your temporary girlfriend! I still need to test you.&#x201D;</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p>
