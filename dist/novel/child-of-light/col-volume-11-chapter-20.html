<p><b><u>Volume 11: Chapter 20 - Disciple? Princess?</u></b></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Aiyo!&#x201D; I turned back to where I heard the sound and saw that the girl had fallen to the ground. She seemed to have tripped. I couldn&#x2019;t help but head back to her due to my principles. </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What&#x2019;s wrong?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Such a nonsensical question, can&#x2019;t you see that I&#x2019;ve tripped? Why aren&#x2019;t you coming to support me?&#x201D; The girl rebuked furiously.</span></p><p><span style="">I didn&#x2019;t want to have any physical contact with her so I cast a fusion power to help her up. She didn&#x2019;t seem to have any injuries, excluding that her tattered clothes. My worries were unfounded.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Miss, please take note of where you&#x2019;re going.&#x201D; Upon saying that, I headed to the south again.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Masked person!&#x201D; She shouted from behind me, but she wasn&#x2019;t as arrogant as before since her voice was gentle and grieving. My heart was softest towards girls so I stopped and asked, &#x201C;What&#x2019;s wrong again?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The young girl looked at me, feeling wronged. &#x201C;Can you please take me back or take me along with you? Where are you heading?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">I frowned as I was going to receive the Radiant God&#x2019;s inheritance so how could I bring a hot tempered girl along? I wasn&#x2019;t even sure if I could return from getting the inheritance. &#x201C;Can you first tell me who you are and why those guys were chasing after you?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The young girl pouted. &#x201C;You want to know who am I?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">I nodded.</span></p><p><span style="">That young girl smiled strangely. &#x201C;I refuse to tell you then. You&#x2019;re going to toss me aside anyways. Who called you to bring me out from the </span><span style="">Str&#xF6;m Fortress? You should be a space elemental mage. Can you tutor me? I&#x2019;ve always liked space magic. I&#x2019;m also an advanced space elemental mage.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">An advanced mage? How could I not see her actual skills? The magic power around her body was faint so she couldn&#x2019;t even be at the intermediate level.</span></p><p><span style="">It was perhaps my dubious eyes that hurt her pride. She snorted and whispered her chant, causing her to disappear from her position to appear on my left side. &#x201C;How&#x2019;s that? You should be able to believe me now. My space magic isn&#x2019;t bad.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Seeing her confident appearance, I couldn&#x2019;t help but laugh. Her short distance teleportation was terrible. It was almost at the level where I started to learn magic. There weren&#x2019;t any good points about it, excluding being able to forcefully get the positioning of the spell right. Not to mention her slow speed in casting the spell, I knew that her magic was extremely weak from her pale complexion.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Miss, I&#x2019;m afraid that you should be at the elementary magic level.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The young girl rebuked, &#x201C;Nonsense, people from the palace&#x2026;I mean from home had told me that I&#x2019;m at the advanced mage level.&#x201D;</span></p><p><i><span style="">&#x2018;Palace? What palace? Could it be&#x2026;&#x2026;&#x2019; </span></i><span style="">I got increasingly curious as I thought about that. &#x201C;How can you be an advanced space mage with only that short teleportation? Let me ask you then, do you know any offensive space spells?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The young girl was stunned by my question as she muttered, &#x201C;Space magic also has offensive spells? Why haven&#x2019;t I heard about that?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;</span><i><span style="">Goodness, It seems that not only her cultivation is weak, her knowledge is also&#x2026;.I&#x2019;ve vaguely guessed that that girl should be a noble&#x2019;s daughter. Otherwise, why is she so haughty?</span></i><span style="">&#x2019; Thinking about that, I said, &#x201C;Take a look at this. This is space offensive magic spell&#x201D; Upon saying that, I brandished my hand, casting a small dimensional slash. There was momentarily a crack in space and was pulling everything &#xA0;towards it. The surrounding rocks and sand were sucked in. The young girl didn&#x2019;t stand stable so she fell towards the small dimensional slash while screaming in fright.</span></p><p><span style="">I waved my hand again to cast a light restriction array to hold her body in place. &#x201C;How&#x2019;s that? You should know what a space offensive spell is now. Alright, you should head back to the city. I believe that your family will be searching anxiously for you now. Farewell!&#x201D; I turned to walk away after saying that.</span></p><p><span style="">That young girl suddenly wailed loudly.</span></p><p><span style="">My patience was already reaching its limit. I turned back and asked, &#x201C; Miss, what&#x2019;s the matter again?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The young girl looked at me, feeling wronged. &#x201C;I...I can&#x2019;t move.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">I instantly understood and berated myself as I actually forgot to undo the light restriction spell due to being in a rush. How could she break out from it with her magic power? I withdrew the light restriction spell. &#x201C;Alright, you should be able to move now.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">That young girl suddenly knelt to the ground and said seriously, &#x201C;Teacher, please accept me as your disciple. I want to be under your guidance.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">I was stunned. &#x2018;</span><i><span style="">Becoming her teacher? That&#x2019;s impossible, I will be annoyed until death by her after accepting her as a disciple.</span></i><span style="">&#x2019; I shook my head. &#x201C;Forget it, my magic level isn&#x2019;t high enough to accept disciples. Please seek tutelage from someone else.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The young girl replied firmly, &#x201C;No! I want to be only under your guidance as no one had been willing to teach me magic. I was only fortunate to meet with you, an expert in space magic, today. You must accept me. Teacher, I&#x2019;m obedient and will pay you for your guidance. My pay is extremely high.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">I chuckled. &#x2018;</span><i><span style="">She actually wants to move me with money? I bet that nobody is willing to teach her due to her &#x2018;obedient&#x2019; attitude.</span></i><span style="">&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">I cast a power to support her body up. &#x201C;Miss, don&#x2019;t call me your teacher. I really have something important to do. You should head back to the fort now.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The young girl stubbornly replied, &#x201C;No, if you don&#x2019;t accept me, I&#x2019;ll jump down from here.&#x201D; Upon saying that, she immediately walked to the edge of the precipice.</span></p><p><span style="">I smiled. &#x201C;I won&#x2019;t accept you even if you were to jump.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The young girl fumed. &#x201C;Alright, you&#x2019;re the one that causes my death then.&#x201D; After saying that, she really jumped, heading into the gulf. I jumped up in shock as I didn&#x2019;t expect her to be so staunch. I hastily brandished Sukrad&#x2019;s staff to cast a light spell to bring her back up. &#x201C;What do you think you&#x2019;re doing? How can you treat your life so lightly?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The young girl looked at me with hatred and with reddened eye rims, she replied, choked with her emotions, &#x201C;You bully me. All of you bully me. You should just let me die.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;</span><i><span style="">I&#x2019;ve got a headache! Why did I meddle in someone&#x2019;s business and land myself in such a situation?</span></i><span style="">&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">The young girl said pitifully, &#x201C;Teacher, you want to know my identity? I will let you know.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">I was stunned as I didn&#x2019;t expect her to voluntarily tell me. It wouldn&#x2019;t hurt to listen so I nodded towards her.</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p>
