<p><strong><u>Volume 3: Chapter 9 &#x2013; Bandit Leader&#x2019;s Charge</u></strong></p><p>&#x201C;Then how about we make a bet?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;What sort of bet?&#x201D; He obviously didn&#x2019;t put me in his eyes.</p><p>I pretended to think for a bit, &#x201C;Let&#x2019;s just bet you won&#x2019;t be able to beat me.&#x201D; My words immediately made all the bandits burst out in wild laughter, apart from the silent bandit standing beside the bandit chief.</p><p>The chief bandit didn&#x2019;t even stop to think and immediately replied: &#x201C;Ok. I&#x2019;ll bet with you. But we won&#x2019;t just be betting on all of your merchandise, we&#x2019;ll also be betting the lives of everyone in your party. You still want to bet?&#x201D; It seems he wasn&#x2019;t foolish, to make use of my group.</p><p>Now I&#x2019;m put into a difficult position, I have to take into consideration the lives of several hundred people. &#x201C;Please let us discuss this for a moment.&#x201D;</p><p>I returned to our party, &#x201C;You all heard my conversation with the chief bandit, what do you guys think?&#x201D;</p><p>Long Meng excitedly said: &#x201C;I hand my life over to you, Great Mage, I&#x2019;m sure you can win against him. How about it brothers?&#x201D; All the mercenaries under Long Meng shouted in uniform: &#x201C;We&#x2019;ll bet.&#x201D; &#xA0;A proper group of brave men.</p><p>I turned to the caravan leader, Mr. Meng, &#x201C;What about you guys, are you willing to put your lives in my hands?&#x201D;</p><p>Mr. Meng was very hesitant, &#x201C;Can you let me discuss it more with that chief bandit?&#x201D; Everyone has the right make their own choices. Although Long Meng&#x2019;s mercenaries were glaring at him, I didn&#x2019;t express anything, &#x201C;Alright, you can try to negotiate again.&#x201D;</p><p>I accompanied Mr. Meng to the bandits, Mr. Meng very politely said, &#x201C;If us merchants don&#x2019;t participate in this bet, can you let us just give you the merchandise and not die?&#x201D;</p><p>The chief bandit impatiently said, &#x201C;Fine, you are so troublesome. Quickly decide what you&#x2019;re going to do. Originally, we could easily capture you guys. We just agreed to your request to let you guys accept defeat. I&#x2019;m not going to be so polite anymore if you don&#x2019;t decide soon.&#x201D;</p><p>Mr. Meng pondered for a bit. First he helpless said to me: &#x201C;I have to insure everyone&#x2019;s safety. I hope you can understand.&#x201D; Then he turned to the chief bandit: &#x201C;We are willing to hand over all the merchandise.&#x201D;</p><p>I silently sighed. Originally, there was an opportunity to withdraw without loss. But now I&#x2019;d rather not fight, as there&#x2019;s no longer any reason to. However spoken words are like spilled water, they can no longer be taken back.</p><p>Seeing the chief bandit&#x2019;s pleased look, I, who is rarely angered, was somewhat upset. First I calmly said to Mr. Meng, &#x201C;Since you do not trust me, then from now on I along with Long Meng&#x2019;s mercenary company will hereby end our employment under you.&#x201D; Mr. Meng shook his head and went back sighing. It seems that he was going to prepare his goods for delivery.</p><p>&#x201C;I represent myself and these twenty brothers of mine in an exchange of pointers with you. If I win, you let us go. If I lose, our lives are yours.&#x201D; I said resolutely with gritted teeth. With my strength, I believed that there was no way I could lose against a Heaven Knight.</p><p>&#x201C;Good. Boy, you have courage. Come!&#x201D;</p><p>All of the bandits went out, leaving a large, empty expanse. It seems that the people of Xiuda greatly care about the fair nature of an exchange of pointers. Long Meng&#x2019;s company were also in the surrounding encirclement, giving me confidence. Those merchants were looking from the distance, waiting for our match to end to hand over their goods.</p><p>I gave the brothers in Long Meng&#x2019;s mercenary company a confidence smile, and loudly said, &#x201C;Brothers, believe in me, I will definitely bring everyone out of this troubling situation.</p><p>At the center of the site, the bandit leader and I stood face to face. I calmly threw off my outer robe and waved my right hand, &#x201C;Come, dimensional storage.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Boy, you are a mage. &#xA0;Then you certainly won&#x2019;t use a horse. I will not use one either. Let us immediately start this match.&#x201D; It seems this bandit is truly worthy of being considered a heaven knight; he truly has a knightly demeanor.</p><p>From the dimensional pocket, I took out my Light God&#x2019;s Robe and wore it. After all, I am bearing the lives of tens of people. I must be cautious. Wearing the Light God&#x2019;s Robe, I immediately gained much spirit power. I cast several defensive enchantments on myself. &#x201C;Come, let me experience this heaven knight&#x2019;s strength.&#x201D;</p><p>The bandit wildly laughed, drew his sword, and flew straight towards me. So fast, I only saw a dim shadow for a flash of a moment, and he had arrived in front of me, in one blur, chopping at my shoulder.</p><p>He is truly fast, so fast that I don&#x2019;t even have enough time to teleport. I waved my right hand and brilliant rays of light came forth to obstruct him.</p><p>The bandit stopped for a moment. &#x201C;Are you a mage or a warrior? How come you have Heaven Battle Spirit?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;I&#x2019;m not using battle spirit. This is just another method of using magic.&#x201D; This is my real strength. Right now I could even cast some rudimentary spells without chanting. I only need to will it then the light elements will congregate into the result I want. This took me three years to comprehend. Although there&#x2019;s still a gap between me and Teacher Di, my power is unexpectedly similar to using battle spirit. At the moment, the bandit wasn&#x2019;t attacking me at all since I was simply too great. Even though I managed to block his attack earlier, my whole right side is numb now. After all, fighting each other like soldiers with short weaponry certainly isn&#x2019;t a mage&#x2019;s strong points. I won&#x2019;t give him this sort of opportunity again.</p><p>Using teleportation, I moved out of his range. It seems like I&#x2019;ll have to use some stronger spells since his battle spirit is actually so powerful. His probing attack just now nearly injured me, if he had used all his strength I would have been unable to resist. I continuously used teleportation to change my position. He&#x2019;s actually really quick as he was only a bit slower than me while I was using teleportation magic. I&#x2019;m afraid he&#x2019;ll cut me down if I stop. This situation can&#x2019;t continue on.</p><p>I dodged to the side and starting chanting an incantation. &#xA0;My hands started to emit a faint white light. The radiance grew stronger. This is a different spell than the one I had just used. This is my improved Light Severing Sword. With a wave of my hand, I can control my magic, using it to directly attack. It is a rank 6 spell, and its single target attack power is exceptionally strong. It is greatly suited to this situation. If Brilliant Empire isn&#x2019;t necessary able to hit him because of his speed, and area attacks too large are spread too thin to be able to harm him, then currently, I can only use Light Severing Sword and stake it all.</p><p>I suddenly stopped and turned around with a white light. He immediately used a battle spirit movement technique and slashed at me with his knight swords that were emitting the same white light. I willed my magic to block it. &#x201C;That&#x2019;s right! Don&#x2019;t run away. It&#x2019;s isn&#x2019;t satisfying if you run away.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Fine then. I&#x2019;ll give something satisfying.&#x201D; Fast as lightning, I shot one Light Severing Sword after another at him. In return, he brandished his knight&#x2019;s sword to block them. Although I was unable to injure him, he was also unable to attack me. Now we&#x2019;ll see who lasts longer, my magic power or his battle spirit.</p><p></p><hr><p></p>
