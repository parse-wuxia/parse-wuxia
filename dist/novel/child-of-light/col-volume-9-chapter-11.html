<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><b>Volume 9: Chapter&#xA0;11 - Cyclops Demon Beast</b></span></p><p><span style="">Damn it, why was I so unlucky? I really wanted to just toss this little fellow over to him. I brandished Sukrad&#x2019;s staff to shoot a golden light over at him.</span></p><p><span style="">The cyclops unexpectedly didn&#x2019;t dodge or hide. He just waved the large branch towards me.</span></p><p><i><span style="">&#x2018;Pu! Chi!</span></i><span style="">&#x2019; sounded as the light blade struck on his body. There was only a trace of blood that was left on his chest, but it wouldn&#x2019;t really result to any damage to his body. I had used an advanced spell but he unexpectedly didn&#x2019;t treat it as a matter. As I was astonished, his branch had arrived. The strong wind that blew towards me had caused my face to hurt. I didn&#x2019;t had the time to dodge so I rapidly made my magic power surge outwards. &#x201C;</span><i><span style="">Hong</span></i><span style="">!&#x201D; The branch that he had sent towards me blew me away like a baseball. I broke through 5 trees before stopping. Even though I used my magic power as a defence, the impact still made my entire body hurt. It seemed that I couldn&#x2019;t underestimate him.</span></p><p><span style="">After Zhan Hu saw that I was blown away, he angrily hollered, &#x201C;War God&#x2019;s Armour!&#x201D; A blue light shone, encasing his body in the magnificent War God&#x2019;s Armour. The cyclops was stunned as he expressed fear from his gazes before retreating two steps.</span></p><p><span style="">Zhan Hu yelled, &#x201C;You actually dared to hurt my brother. You shall see how I&#x2019;ll deal with you.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">When they were confronting each other, I used short teleport to teleport back and scolded, &#x201C;F*ck, you bastard. You had the gall to dare to hit me. If Xiao Jin was here, I would tear you to pieces.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Dong Ri said with smiles, &#x201C;It seems that there are also times when Zhang Gong is aggrieved.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">I fumingly shouted, &#x201C;You&#x2019;re good! You also dare mock me. I&#x2019;ll pass him to you. Big brother Zhan Hu, it has been awhile since I have seen Dong Ri&#x2019;s skills. Let him do it!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Zhan Hu chuckled as he put &#xA0;his War God&#x2019;s Armour away and he said, &#x201C;Alright! Dong Ri, he&#x2019;s all yours!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Dong Ri puffed out his chest and replied, &#x201C;No problem!&#x201D; He had moved in a flash to stand in the forefront. Drawing his Wind God&apos;s Bow, the cyclops hollered and charged again due to the lost of threat from the War God&apos;s Armor..</span></p><p><span style="">Dong Ri coldly snorted and his face became slightly rosy as he yelled out, &#x201C;The God King bestowed upon me the Wind God&apos;s Bow and with it my ethereal arrows will flash rapidly and violently!&#x201D; He raised his hand instantly, making the Wind God&apos;s Bow produce a</span><i><span style=""> &#x2018;Weng!&#x2019;</span></i><span style=""> sound. </span><i><span style="">&#x2018;Hong!</span></i><span style="">&#x2019; The cyclops&#x2019; head suddenly exploded before us, without any light rays in view. His limbs wavered before he collapsed on the ground like a ruined pillar.</span></p><p><span style="">Dong Ri panted a few breathes before he placed the Wind God&apos;s Bow back into his body. He then said, &#x201C;Big brother Zhang Gong, what do you think? My abilities are still good, right?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">I looked at him in astonishment. It seemed that all the God&#x2019;s weapon were extraordinary; no matter what type of weapon, it had strong powers. I replied, &#x201C;Dong Ri, you&#x2019;ve already completely grasped the power of Wind God&#x2019;s Bow?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Dong Ri shook his head. &#x201C;How can it be that easy, even Big brother Zhan Hu hasn&#x2019;t completely grasped his power. I can only use 30% of the Wind God&#x2019;s Ethereal Arrows.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Jian Shan walked over and said in surprise, &#x201C;Dong Ri, so you&#x2019;re this powerful. If what you did was only 30% of its power, then how powerful would it be if it&#x2019;s at full power?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">I replied with smiles, &#x201C;It&#x2019;s not impossible for it to be able to ravage the mountains and fill the seas. However, our enemy is much more powerful.&#x201D; I glanced at Su He, but I didn&#x2019;t talked about the Monster King.</span></p><p><span style="">Jian Shan said in amazement, &#x201C;You&#x2019;re so powerful. You&#x2019;re worthy to be God&#x2019;s inheritors.&#x201D; Upon hearing what he said, I hastily glared at him. Jian Shan realized that he had said too much so he quickly changed the topic by saying, &#x201C;That cyclops should be able to supply us with food for a couple of days.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Su He seemed to have not heard what Jian Shan had said and walked over. &#x201C;This is a Cyclops demon beast. The most impressive point of him isn&#x2019;t his power nor the toughness of his limbs, but rather, it&#x2019;s his ability to stun people with a light ray from his eye. Dong Ri is so powerful. The beast didn&#x2019;t even have a chance to use his single eye&#x2019;s ability before he was killed. Moreover, this was at least an A ranked demon beast, which is also rare among the army troops of the demon race. I&#x2019;m completely mesmerized by your powers.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Dong Ri scolded him mockingly, &#x201C;Stop flattering us. Big brother Zhan Hu, I&#x2019;ll take a short break. You must cook some sumptuous roasted meat for everyone to eat. Don&#x2019;t waste my efforts.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Zhan Hu smiled and said, &#x201C;This fella should be able to supply us for ten days to half a month. I&#x2019;ll cook two portions of it today. One is for us to eat in a bit and the other for us to bring along with us on our journey.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">I furrowed my eyebrows and asked, &#x201C;How shall we cook it? How large of a pot will we need?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Zhan Hu replied, &#x201C;Won&#x2019;t that be easy? We also won&#x2019;t be eating all of it. We just have to cut off all of its limbs so that we can have it for a couple of days. As for the pot, we can just find a place that has water and dig a large pit. After placing water in it, we&#x2019;ll be able to start cooking.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">I asked, &#x201C;How are we going to cook? We won&#x2019;t be able to heat it up and it&#x2019;s unhygienic as well.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Zhan Hu chuckled. &#x201C;Won&#x2019;t we be able to separate the meat from the walls of the pit with your magic? As for heating it up, don&#x2019;t tell me that you don&#x2019;t know any elementary or intermediate fire spells.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Damn it, it seemed that he had locked onto me for quite sometime already. Without a choice, I became the second cook for this meal. We had almost completely used up all of Big brother Zhan Hu&#x2019;s seasonings to cook the cyclops. After everyone had their fill, I called the demon fox out and told her, &#x201C;Change into your other form for me.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">After a black fog flashed, the demon fox had turned into her other charming form. &#x201C;Master, do you have any orders?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">I chuckled before I replied to her in cold smile, &#x201C;When you previously lured that cyclops over, was it a plot against my life?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The demon fox shook her hand. &#x201C;No, no! It was Master Zhan Hu that told me to find something larger. I definitely have to find something extremely large.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">I grabbed her by the neck and said, &#x201C;If you&#x2019;re playing some trick, you should be wary of me.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The demon fox replied, feeling wronged. &#x201C;It really wasn&#x2019;t my intention. With Master&#x2019;s power, you shouldn&#x2019;t have trouble eliminating that single eyed ugly ghost.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">I released my hold before I said, &#x201C;If I find out that you were lying to me, I&#x2019;ll let Big brother roast you as well.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">There were two drops of tears that flowed out of the demon fox&#x2019;s eyes. With a sway of her body, she had turned back to a one tailed demon fox. She ran to a side, ignoring me. It seemed that she was enraged. I smiled a little before I also ignored her.</span></p><p><span style=""> &#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#x2026;&#x2026;</span></p><p><span style="">After a night of recuperating and building up our energies, everyone&#x2019;s spirit was &#xA0;better. After packing up, everyone carried some of the remaining portions of the Cyclops demon meat. I told the demon fox, &#x201C;Little thing, we&#x2019;re going to fly. If you don&#x2019;t want to be left behind, quickly come over to me.&#x201D; The demon fox stared at me with widen eyes before she unwillingly came over and lept onto my shoulder. I pet her furry little head as I said &#x201C;You&#x2019;re still angry. We shall count last night&#x2019;s reprimand to be something that I had wrongly accused you.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">The demon fox angrily chirped out twice at me in dissatisfaction. Her cute looks made me chuckle. I said, &#x201C;Alright! Alright! I had wrongly accused you.&#x201D; With that, she leaned on my shoulder without moving in satisfaction.</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p>
