<p><b><u>Volume 11: Chapter 31 - Returning to the Domain</u></b></p><p><span style="">When I flew from the God Rended Canyon to the Demon race&#x2019;s plateau, it was still the same desolate place as the first time I came. The only difference was that the boundary of the God Rended Canyon had disappeared.</span></p><p><span style="">Suddenly, I was alarmed as I perceived faint trace of the Monster race&#x2019;s aura with my divine powers. It seemed that the Monster race had already made their move. No matter how pressing time was, I still had to make a trip back to the God Protector Domain.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;</span><i><span style="">With my current powers, my skill in using long distance teleportation array should be fairly accurate. I will give it a try, in order to save time. I can still fly back to the base even if the positioning is erred, and I will still have a shorter distance to travel.</span></i><span style="">&#x2019; Thinking about that, I secured the Holy Sword and used the God&#x2019;s Guard on my right hand to draw the long distance teleportation array. The God&#x2019;s Guard showed its versatility as &#xA0;it drew up the appropriate magic array with a mere thought. The array was also those kind of complicated long distance magic array that required lots of mental power. The previous me would have spent a long time drawing such an array, in order to rest and recover my mental power to prevent mistakes in drawing the array. But this time was different, I didn&#x2019;t feel any exhaustion and my mind was in its peak condition as well. I took just half an hour to draw up the enormously complicated long distance magic array. I was quite confident that I should be within a five kilometer radius of the God Protector Domain.</span></p><p><span style="">I used my six wings of light to envelop myself before taking a deep breath and entering the magic array.After I took a final look at the now desolate looking God Rended Canyon, I started the chant to activate the magic array. With a flash of light, I entered a seven coloured world. With the protection of the wings, I felt no resistance and my surroundings were rapidly fading away. With the scenery constantly changing, it made me light headed, so I closed my eyes.</span></p><p><span style="">After my body lightened, the surrounding pressure vanished. I was now standing on the peak of a lofty mountain. Clusters of clouds passed by that hit my body with their moisture. After noticing my body was bare, I couldn&#x2019;t help but to chuckle. How could I go and meet up with the rest looking like this? Wouldn&#x2019;t I be forced out of the domain like this? I retrieved some clothes from my spacial pocket and wore a white coloured light attribute magic robe on my exterior.</span></p><p><span style="">When I activated my divine will to survey my surroundings, unexpectedly the God Protector Domain wasn&#x2019;t far front from my location. However, the domain seemed too peaceful. This kind of situation shouldn&#x2019;t occur, even at night. I was alarmed. Had something happened?</span></p><p><span style="">I flapped the six light wings on my back to fly towards the God Protector Domain. Within a few blinks of an eye, I was above the God Protector Domain. The interior of the domain was pitch black. I could only feel a minority of human presences, when compared to the previous 10,000 plus people in the domain previously. Could it be that the Monster race had attacked this place? It shouldn&#x2019;t be, there wasn&#x2019;t any lingering aura of the Monster race here!</span></p><p><span style="">I withdrew my wings and landed on the ground. Anxiously, I rapidly activated the river-like divine power, making intense light rays to light up the domain.</span></p><p><span style="">Nothing had changed. The mountain range and sentries were the same from when I left previously. The stone houses were also still in their original positions.</span></p><p><span style="">I used my divine power to call out, &#x201C;Is anyone here?&#x201D; An enormous voice surged towards the sky, vibrating the surrounding stone houses. I was also shocked at such an outcome because I didn&#x2019;t use much divine power!</span></p><p><span style="">My voice constantly echoed. Every living being in the mountain range should have heard my call. I was too lazy to go on a man hunt because I quickly wanted to know what was happening here, so I used the most simplest method possible. Expectedly, once the sound weakened, a couple people from the domain gathered towards my location. </span></p><p><span style="">I withdrew the wings from my back to return into my body, because seeing such a sight would be universally shocking.</span></p><p><span style="">Ten black shadows surrounded me like lightning. &#x2018;</span><i><span style="">Their power seems so little. It&#x2019;s as though that I can eliminate them just by moving my fingers. When did the brothers of our domain become so weak</span></i><span style="">?&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">After I realized who had come, I couldn&#x2019;t help but to doubt my thoughts. &#xA0;The leader of the crowd was Jian Shan and his cultivation wasn&#x2019;t weak. </span><i><span style="">&#x2019;His power couldn&#x2019;t have deteriorated, right?&#x2019;</span></i></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Who are you? What&#x2019;s your motive in intruding my God Protector Domain so late at night?&#x201D; Jian Shan was shocked as he saw the divine light emitted from my body when he queried. It was probably because I was wearing a mask that resulted to his failure to recognize me.</span></p><p><span style="">I smiled wryly. &#x201C;What? I hadn&#x2019;t seen you for a few days and you don&#x2019;t know me anymore? I&#x2019;m Zhang Gong!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Jian Shan looked at me warily, but his suspicious expression changed to elation after a while. He said in a shaky voice, &#x201C;Zhang Gong? Zhang Gong, is that really you? You&#x2019;re finally back.&#x201D; He abruptly charged in front of my body to grab onto my shoulders. But when he was a meter away from me, he suddenly stopped and struggled for a while. He frowned and asked, &#x201C;Zhang Gong, what did you do?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">I was stunned as I hadn&#x2019;t cast a protective barrier! How did this happen? I scratched my head and explained, &#x201C;I didn&#x2019;t do anything! It must be due to the too rapid increase in my powers, I haven&#x2019;t fully grasped them. Jian Shan, where is everyone? Why is there only so few men in the base? Where&#x2019;s Big Brother Zhan Hu and the rest? Where&#x2019;s Mu Zi?&#x201D; In the middle of my speech I tried my best to withdraw the powers emitted from my body. Only then was I able to embrace Jian Shan.</span></p><p><span style="">Jian Shan&#x2019;s body shook slightly. He was obviously excited as it had been sometimes since we parted from each other. Jian Shan complained, &#x201C;You left without saying a word and also gone for such a long time. Do you know that the continent had undergone so many changes that the heavens and earth had flipped upside down?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">I asked, stunned, &#x201C;I&#x2019;ve left for a long time? How long did I left for?&#x201D;</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p>
