<p><b><u>Volume 12: Chapter 30 -&#xA0;God King</u></b></p><p><span style="">The Monster King&#x2019;s matter had finally been resolved and I was rescued by the God King. However, I wasn&#x2019;t the slightest bit happy as Hai Shui had died because of me! The God King had also said that he didn&#x2019;t have the power to revive the dead. This was to say that Hai Shui wouldn&#x2019;t be able to return to my side. Why? Why did this happen? Hai Shui was such a kind hearted girl. Why did she had to die? </span></p><p><span style="">The God King said, &#x201C;Child, you had accomplished such an ordeal task. I&#x2019;m really happy for that. Currently, the human race already thinks that you have already passed on. Why don&#x2019;t you stay in the God race then? Since you have inherited Mi Jie Lie&#x2019;s position, you&#x2019;ll become the new battle angel&#x2019;s leader, the new Radiant God. In this God realm, you&#x2019;ll have endless life.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;No!!!&#x201D; I yelled in sadness. &#x201C;No, I don&#x2019;t want eternal life. I don&#x2019;t want anything.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The God King seemed to be stunned for a moment. &#x201C;My child, you should think it through carefully. A lot of people have dreamed to be able to become a god!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">I shook my head with sadness. &#x201C;No, God King, I don&#x2019;t want to become a god nor do I want to have eternal life. I just want to be with my family and friends. You&#x2019;re the God King. Are you really out of alternatives in helping me revive my friends? It&#x2019;s just a tiny request from me. Please grant me this wish of mine.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The God King sighed. &#x201C;Child, I understand your current feelings, but I had mentioned it previously that that is out of my powers! I&#x2019;ll agree to any of your request, except that.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">I dejectedly knelt to the ground as I looked at the divine instruments, staying silent for a long time.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Child, please don&#x2019;t be like this. Your contribution to the world, to all of the races, and to our God race has given rise to the survival of both worlds. Where there&#x2019;s a gain, there&#x2019;s also loss. Please state your request.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">I took in a deep breath. &#x201C;God King, I hope that you&#x2019;ll withdraw all of the divine instruments and allow me to return to the human realm. I also don&#x2019;t want eternal life. I just want to be an ordinary human and finish a not too long journey with my family and friends.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The God King exclaimed., &#x201C;What?! You also don&#x2019;t want to have eternal life?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">I seriously nodded. &#x201C;Eternal life doesn&#x2019;t mean much to me. If my family and friends all died before me, what is the use of living on? Please grant me my wish.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">After a moment, the God King replied, &#x201C;Alright, since you have made up your mind, I won&#x2019;t continue to force you. Zhang Gong, you&#x2019;ll forever be a friend to our God race.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">After a light flashed, my entire body was so warm and was in indescribable comfort. It was like taking a bath in a sea of light. &#x201C;Zhang Gong, I&#x2019;ve withdrawn the six divine weapons from your body, but still left you with the Radiant God&#x2019;s powers. Your life force has already completely recovered. Return and do as you wish. I&#x2019;ve got something to tell you. The spirit of the girl that was possessed by the Monster King hasn&#x2019;t dissipated. You will still have the opportunity to meet her again in the future.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">I was shocked and just as I wanted to ask him, my body was enveloped in intense light rays. With a flash of light, everything before me turned white and everything disappeared.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x3000;&#x3000;&#x2026;&#x2026;&#x2026;&#x2026;</span></p><p><span style="">Even though the Monster race had been eradicated, the entire </span><span style="">Str&#xF6;m Fortress was in despair as the Child of Light, Zhang Gong Wei, who had saved the world, had sacrificed his young life for the world&#x2019;s peace and harmony.</span></p><p><span style="">Lao Lun Di caressed Mu ZI and Xiao Rou&#x2019;s head with tears in his eyes. &#x201C;Good children, stop crying. When a person passes on, they won&#x2019;t be able to return. Zhang Gong is my one and only disciple but was also my pride. He had sacrificed his life to save everyone. Hi</span><span style="">s death carries a heavy weight.</span><span style="">&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Lao Lun Di&#x2019;s consolation didn&#x2019;t stop everyone from crying, but made everyone wail instead. Zhang Gong had managed to kill the Monster King by unhesitantly burning his life force. His action had greatly touched everyone&#x2019;s heart. </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Report!!&#x201D; A dispatched solver hurriedly entered the Commander&#x2019;s division. &#x201C;Reporting, there&#x2019;s a peculiar phenomenon happening in the sky.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Everyone were alarmed and Chuan Song Zhen asked, &#x201C;What phenomenon? Quickly describe it!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;There was a patch of coloured clouds that suddenly appeared in the sky and had stopped above the fort.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Everyone looked at each other before Zhan Hu said, &#x201C;Let&#x2019;s head out and check it out.&#x201D; Everyone from the God Protector Domain and the leaders of the armies from the three kingdoms simultaneously headed out of the Commander&#x2019;s division. It was as what the soldier had reported. There was a patch of coloured cloud in the sky. It looked exceptionally mesmerising under the sunlight.</span></p><p><span style="">Chuan Song Zhen ordered heavily, &#x201C;Pass down my order that every troop should be on standby and to be on alert.&#x201D; The appearance of the Monster race had already made everyone easily fearful.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I don&#x2019;t think that&#x2019;s necessary Teacher Zhen. It can&#x2019;t be that you don&#x2019;t want me to return right?&#x201D; A voice that everyone couldn&#x2019;t be more familiar with was heard. A gold light ray shone from the coloured cloud and moved before everyone like lightning.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Zhang Gong!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">When I looked at the tears covered faces of the crowd, I said smilingly, &#x201C;I&#x2019;ve made everyone worried. I&#x2019;ve returned.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Mu ZI and Xiao Rou jumped into my embrace and Mu Zi shouted crying, &#x201C;Where did you go? You made me worried to death.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">I caressed Mu Zi&#x2019;s long hair and smiled, &#x201C;Silly girl, everything has passed. I just went to tour the God realm. The only pitiful thing is that Hai Shui&#x2026;...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;God realm!&#x201D; Everyone instantly exclaimed.</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p>
