<p><b><u>Volume 12: Chapter 21 - Soloing the Three Great Monsters</u></b></p><p><span style="">The phoenix had spread its 33 meters enormous large flame covered wings saying, &#x201C;Monster King, you had previously sealed my body and made me suffer for so many years. Today, it&#x2019;s time for payback.&#x201D; He turned his head towards me and with benevolent light rays in his eyes, he said, &#x201C;Child, it&#x2019;s time for me to repay what you had done for me. I didn&#x2019;t forget my previous vow.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">My heart heated up and just as I wanted to reply him, an enormous pressure charged towards me. I hastily lifted the sword to block Jia Si Ke Li Duo&#x2019;s attack. When the Dark Monster blade and the Holy Sword came into contact with each other, Jia Si Ke Li Duo and my body instantly shuddered violently before abruptly being blown backwards from the impact.</span></p><p><span style="">The phoenix in the sky didn&#x2019;t seem to see what was happening as his sight was solely on the Monster King. &#x201C;Dragon King, let&#x2019;s fight along side against that monster today. No matter if we survive or die, we will have given our all.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The Dragon King laughed. &#x201C;Alright! Alright, Brother Phoenix, it has been such a long time since we last met. It should have been a few hundred years already. Your phoenix flames are still as scorching hot. Let&#x2019;s give out a combination of dragon and phoenix roars today.&#x201D; Upon saying that, the Dragon King raised his head to give out a clear dragon roar. With intense gold light ray being emitted from his body, it didn&#x2019;t look as though he had just suffered from severe injuries. His domineering aura filled the sky. It was as though he wanted to prove his Dragon King&#x2019;s identity to the world.</span></p><p><span style="">The phoenix similarly laughed before hollering as well. A dragon and a phoenix loud roars were constantly being rang in the sky towards the horizon. This change of situation momentarily increased my confidence. I brandished the Holy Sword with all my might, constantly striking against Jia SI Ke Li Duo&#x2019;s Dark Monster blade.</span></p><p><span style="">The Monster King&apos;s expression changed constantly with her arms crossed before her chest, before saying coldly, &#x201C;Since you&#x2019;ve all gathered, I&#x2019;ll grant all of wishes at once.&#x201D; Upon saying that, her greyish blue long hair floated behind her back and with a demonic red light ray in her eyes, an enormous demonic source suddenly appeared from her back. The overpowering demonic aura filled the space behind her. The grey aura conflicted against the aura being emitted by the Dragon King and the phoenix.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ah!!&#x201D; An unknown fury call out was heard. Gold, red and grey figures, varying in sizes, simultaneously charged towards the center. The three figures constantly conflicted against each other. The tyrannical powers being sent off by them made Jia Si Ke Li Duo, Xiao Jin, the Blood monster and I to be simultaneously forced at least 1 kilometer back. Looking at the current scene, it was still hard to see who had the upperhand in the battle.</span></p><p><span style="">I didn&#x2019;t bother continuing to watch their battle as I released my powers to the limit and frantically fought against Jia Si Ke Li Duo. The radiant Holy Sword constantly came in contact with the Dark Monster blade without any gaudiness. The explosive like power filled the sky. Even though Jia Si Ke Li Duo&#x2019;s power had increased drastically after the fusion of the bodies, his eyes seemed to be in a daze as it wouldn&#x2019;t be easy for a body to house two spirits.</span></p><p><span style="">The radiant Holy Sword was the top divine instrument in the God world so how could the Dark Monster blade be able to withstand against it? Small nicks gradually appeared on the Dark Monster blade with each strike against each other. However, Jia Si Ke Li Duo didn&#x2019;t seem to care about that as he continued to circulate his strong demonic powers to continuously fight against my sword.</span></p><p><span style="">The divine powers in my body seemed to be exceptionally excited. The six light wings on my back were constantly absorbing the nature energy from the surrounding. Powers like a large river continuously entered my body, allowing me to sustain my peak condition. The Holy Sword was also constantly striking towards Jia Si Ke Li Duo, a strike after a strike. As time flowed, the powers from the fusion body of Jia SI Ke Li Duo and Ha Er yue Di gradually lessened as it could no longer withstand my attacks. His body was constantly being pushed back. The cracks on the Dark monster blade was increasingly getting larger.</span></p><p><span style="">Jia Si Ke Li Duo seemed to discover that he was at the disadvantage as he abruptly used all of his power to push me back while drawing a peculiar rune in the air with his left hand. He opened his mouth to emit a black fog. When the black fog got in contact with the strange rune, the black light ray intensified. A dozen enormous bone shaped black fog charged towards me. I thought, &#x2018;</span><i><span style="">He still wants to resist even after knowing that his demise is nearing?</span></i><span style="">&#x2019; I used the Holy Sword to draw an arc before my body. The silver light ray, as well as the devastative Holy light, was abruptly emitted from it. The vast silver light ray seemed to engulf all of the bone fogs. The bone was constantly resisting in the Holy Light. It seemed as though it wasn&#x2019;t to breakout from comfort. But how could I let that happen? I constantly surged powers into the Holy Sword by the God&#x2019;s Guard protector to maintain the intensity of the Holy Light.</span></p><p><span style="">Finally, after a moment of abnormal shrieks, all of the bones finally dissipated. Jia Si Ke Li Duo seemed to suffer severe injuries as his entire body shook violently. I definitely wouldn&#x2019;t let such a good opportunity slip. With my body and sword as one identity, I charged over. The silver light ray of the Holy Sword suddenly withdrew. It seemed as though it was gathering all of its power into the Holy Sword</span></p><p><span style="">Fear was seen in Jia Si Ke Li Duo&#x2019;s eyes. He violently raised the Dark Monster blade with both of his hands to strike towards me. He was already at his last moments so how could I still reserve my strength? With a shout, the Holy Sword in my hand gave off a mesmerizing light ray, I struck towards the nicks covered Dark Monster blade. The blade and sword came into contact with each other again. I was having a close combat with Jia Si Ke Li Duo. We were circulating our powers with all out might to suppress each other. Jia Si Ke Li Duo&#x2019;s nicked covered Dark Monster blade gradually started to break down under the might of the Holy Sword.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Go to hell!&#x201D; Upon my furious holler, the Holy Sword had been circulated to its limit. The grey aura from the Monster blade from the Dark Monster blade gradually faded. I was currently at Jia Si Ke Li Duo&#x2019;s bak. His expanded body just silently hovered there. It was like time had stilled.</span></p><p><i><span style="">Hong! </span></i><span style="">Demon King Satan&#x2019;s body that was being possessed by Jia Si Ke Li Duo had completely blown apart. A grey fog appeared from his body and headed like lightning towards the Blood Monster Ka An Da Er Jia, who was fighting against Xiao Jin. When I sliced Jia Si Ke Li Duo&#x2019;s body with the Holy Sword, I had clearly felt that Jia Si Ke Li Duo&#x2019;s soul had been obliterated by the Holy Sword&#x2019;s tyrannical divine powers. There was no longer his soul in Demon King Satan&#x2019;s body, while the Witch Monster Ha Er yue Di&#x2019;s soul seemed to have been severely damaged. It was that grey fog that was currently trying to escape from me. Of course, I wouldn&#x2019;t let what had previously happened to occur again as if Ha Er Yue Di fused with the Blood Monster Ka An Da Er Jia&#x2019;s body, I would have to undergo another bitter battle.</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p>
