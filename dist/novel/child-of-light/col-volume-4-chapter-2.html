<p><b><u><span>Volume 4: Chapter 2 &#x2013; The Warmth of Home</span></u></b></p><p><span>After mother heard that I still had to gain experience, she got anxious. &#x201C;You still need to gain more experience? I nearly died from worrying all this time, I was so scared that you would run into danger. Do you have to go again?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>I embraced her and said, &#x201C;Mom, even if I have to go, it&#x2019;s still a matter for two or three years into the future. We still don&#x2019;t know what will happen, and we can&#x2019;t plan for what will change.&#x201D; Mother started to calm down. &#x201C;Alright, you father and son continue to chat. I&#x2019;ll go and make some delicious food.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Mom, please make more. I invited Ao De to come to our house for dinner.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Ok, I know.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>After mother went into the kitchen, I said to my father, &#x201C;Father, once I enter and train at the Advanced Magic Academy, I&#x2019;m afraid that I will have to head out again to gain more experience for a long period of time.&#x201D; I started to tell him about the task that the God King had given us that I had left out earlier. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span>Father sighed a lot, before saying, &#x201C;Child, for the peace and harmony of the world, go. You don&#x2019;t need to worry about me or your mother. If you can get the God&#x2019;s inheritance, I will be proud of you.&#x201D; &#xA0;</span></p><p><span>I started to choke with sobs. &#x201C;Fa-Father. Thank you.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>I took a sack out of my pouch and gave it to Father. &#x201C;This is what Teacher Di gave me for my expenditures during training. I have not used much of it so I could leave some for you.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Father smiled and took it. &#x201C;That&#x2019;s wonderful, my son is being so filial to us. Ha ha.&#x201D; When he opened the sack, he was shocked by the shine of the treasures inside. The sack was filled with sparkling diamond coins.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Wow! So much! You should just keep it for yourself.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;I still have five hundred diamond coins so Mom and you don&#x2019;t need to be too thrifty.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>At this moment, Ao De&#x2019;s voice came from outside the door. &#x201C;Zhang Gong, I am here! Hurry and open the door!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Coming!&#x201D; I hurriedly ran out to invite Ao De and Luo Yu in.</span></p><p><span>Ao De said, &#x201C;Hello, uncle.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Good! Quickly take a seat! This should be Luo Yu, right?&#x201D; Father asked, smiling.</span></p><p><span>Luo Yu&#x2019;s face reddened as she said, &#x201C;Hello, uncle.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Father laughed and said, &#x201C;Hello, little Luo Yu is becoming more and more pretty.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>I asked curiously, &#x201C;Father, you&#x2019;ve met Luo Yu before?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Father said, &#x201C;Of course I have! And I frequently see her. Every day she is always paired with Ao De. Almost everyone in the village has seen her. Ha ha.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>At this moment, Mother carried a dish in and said, &#x201C;Yes! Look how skilled Ao De is, finding such a pretty girlfriend. When will you be bringing one home for Mom to see?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;I also want to, but I have not found a match. I am not as capable as Ao De. Who would want to be with me anyway?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Mother said, &#x201C;I&#x2019;m not asking for you to get an extremely beautiful girl. As long as she treats you well and is pretty, I will be satisfied.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>I smiled and said, &#x201C;I do think the same way as you mom, but I also want to find an average girl. I find that beautiful girls are hard to deal with and have bad tempers.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Ao De said, &#x201C;Who says that! You just have to look at Luo Yu. She is extremely well tempered and is also very easy to deal with.&#x201D; Luo Yu&#x2019;s face reddened, but did not say anything.</span></p><p><span>I mock scolded, &#x201C;Seeing how lucky you are, quickly go and bring the dishes out together with me!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>With everyone&#x2019;s help, the table was soon filled with sumptuous dishes. Everyone ate their meals joyously and harmoniously. I brought out a crystal bottle that contained the fragrant fruit wine, which everyone looked at with curiosity.</span></p><p><span>I mysteriously said, &#x201C;This is the Nature Elves&#x2019; fragrant fruit wine. It is very rare. I helped them a lot so they gifted it to me. Everyone have a taste!&#x201D; I poured a small cup of wine for everyone. The scent of the fragrant wine filled the whole house.</span></p><p><span>Everyone looked at their cups curiously. Father, who drank frequently, said, &#x201C;This is a really good wine! It&#x2019;s so fragrant!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;It tastes even better! Everyone quickly have a try!&#x201D; As expected, the fragrant wine subdued everyone. In only a short moment, the bottle of wine was finished and they wanted more! Of course, I told them that I only had one bottle.</span></p><p><span>Mother brought up the previous topic and said, &#x201C;Zhang Gong, this time when you return to the academy, you must bring a girlfriend back home no matter what. If not, I will not forgive you. You are already about twenty years old! Usually everyone starts to get married at eighteen or nineteen, but you still have not found one yet!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>With a look I appealed to my father for help, who in turn said, &#x201C;In this case, I cannot help you this time as I also wish for you to get married soon. At that time, you can give me a grandchild. Ha ha.&#x201D; After listening to what Father said, my entire face reddened.</span></p><p><span>I replied, &#x201C;Ok! At that time, I will find an ugly daughter in law and come home!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Mother smiled. &#x201C;That does not matter, as long as she does not look worse than me!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Father whispered, &#x201C;Please don&#x2019;t find someone like your mother. You have to find someone with less attitude. If not, you will suffer for your whole life.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Mother&#x2019;s hearing was still very good and she had heard everything he had said. Immediately, she angrily said, &#x201C;My temper&#x2019;s very bad? When have you suffered? After today, I won&#x2019;t cook you food or wash your clothes anymore. I serve you every day, yet you say I&#x2019;m no good!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Father immediately begged for mercy. &#x201C;No! No! My wife is the best, prettiest, gentlest, wisest and kindest of them all! You are definitely a role model to any future mother that wants to be a good wife and a loving mother!&#x201D; Father&#x2019;s comical expression made all of us laugh.</span></p><p><span>Mother smiled and said, &#x201C;You pathetic old man!&#x201D; &#xA0;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>Father asked me, &#x201C;When are you returning to the academy?&#x201D; Mother wordlessly looked at me.</span></p><p><span>I smiled and said, &#x201C;This time I will be staying a few days to keep you company. In about a month&#x2019;s time, I will start to head back. Does that sound fine? Mother, are you satisfied?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Mother smiled and nodded, then said, &#x201C;That is good enough! Out of the three hundred days in a year, you were never at home. Your father and I could only stare at each other every day. You don&#x2019;t even know how lonely I was.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>This time, it was Father that shot back. &#x201C;You were lonely when you were with me?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Mother smiled. &#x201C;Ha ha, who told you to say that I had a bad temper earlier?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>I hurriedly said, &#x201C;That&#x2019;s right! Father, Mom, do you want to learn some advanced magic? I can teach it to you! This is so that when I leave, you can practice the magic in your free time and will no longer feel lonely.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Mother excitedly said, &#x201C;That&#x2019;s wonderful! It is a great idea, but the magic you learn is light magic. Your father and I are water and wind magicians. Can we still learn it?&#x201D; &#xA0;</span></p><p><span>I said, &#x201C;That does not matter as your bodies&#x2019; magic abilities are not very high, so even if you totally give up on learning, it will not be a big problem. You just need to relearn light magic. Light magic&#x2019;s healing techniques are better than water magic&#x2019;s anyway. Moreover, light magic&#x2019;s offensive power are also very powerful!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Father said, &#x201C;That&#x2019;s fine then! In any case, staying idle is still boring. Starting from tomorrow, your mother and I will learn light magic from you!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Ao De said, &#x201C;Add us in as well! We also want to learn!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>I said, &#x201C;Alright! I&#x2019;ll start teaching you all tomorrow. The lesson will begin in the morning!&#x201D; I am a light magic Magister. In the entire world, aside from Teacher Di, I should be the best at understanding light magic. Even so, teaching them will still prove to be a very difficult task.</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p>
