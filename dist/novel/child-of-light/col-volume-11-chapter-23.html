<p><b><u>Volume 11: Chapter 23 -&#xA0;Embarrassed</u></b></p><p><span style="">Ke Er Lan Di politely replied, &quot;Your Majesty, aside from the silver mask, the rest of the mage&#x2019;s appearance matched up with God&apos;s Envoy Zhang Gong when we met. Moreover, when we had split up, he said that his destination was the </span><span style="">Str&#xF6;m Fortress</span><span style=""> and that he had something important to settle. I didn&apos;t tell him that Your Majesty was here. We then sped up to reach here faster. I wanted to introduce him to you before he settled his matters. Zhang Gong definitely isn&#x2019;t simple, his magic level has reached the pinnacle of perfection. He alone was able to solitarily cast a forbidden spell! If her Royal Highness is really with him, there shouldn&apos;t be any danger as Zhang Gong is a very righteous person.&quot; He raised his head to look at Tian Feng Lou Chen, who seemed to be deep in thought. &quot;I&apos;m afraid that it&#x2019;s Zhang Gong that will be in trouble.&quot; Thinking about the obstinate ill-behaved Princess Fei Yu, Ke Er Lan Di started to have a headache.</span></p><p><span style="">Tian Feng Luo Chen asked the soldier, &#x201C;Are you certain that mage said that he was Fei Yu&#x2019;s teacher?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">That soldier said with fear and trepidation, &#x201C;Yes, Your Majesty. I am certain.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Tian Feng Luo Chen turned towards Ke Er Lan Di. &#x201C;Since that&#x2019;s the case, you bring along the Eight Magical Swords to find them. If that person really is God&#x2019;s Envoy, Zhang Gong, you are not allowed to get into conflict with him. If Fei Yu really doesn&#x2019;t want to return, you can just let her be.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What?!&#x201D; Ke Er Lan Di cried out. Emperor Tian Feng actually allowed his daughter to follow an unfamiliar man.</span></p><p><span style="">A glimmer flashed in Tian Feng Luo Chen&#x2019;s eyes. &#x201C;Just do as I&#x2019;ve said! You can take your leave now.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes, Your Majesty.&#x201D; Ke Er Lan Di turned around to leave the Commander&#x2019;s Division. &#xA0;Eight shadows leapt out from a corner and followed him out.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x3000;&#x3000;&#x2026;&#x2026;&#x2026;&#x2026;</span></p><p><span style="">I brought Fei Yu along as I flew towards the south. We had already reached the plateau of the Demon race after flying for a while. We should now just search towards the south, according to the directions of that robust man at the fort, to be able to find the God Rended Canyon.</span></p><p><span style="">When I landed, I circulated the Holy Sword&#x2019;s power to investigate my surroundings to check if there was any presence of abnormality. Fei Yu gushed, &#x201C;Teacher, the feeling of flying is so great! When will you be teaching me how to fly?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">I smiled wryly. &#x201C;Do you think it&#x2019;s that easy to fly? Without a solid magic foundation, it&#x2019;s impossible to fly. According to your current level, you&#x2019;ll need to bitterly train for 10 years before you can fly. Under no special conditions, you&#x2019;re most likely unable to fly.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Fei Yu replied, displeased, &#x201C;Don&#x2019;t care! I want to be able to fly now. You must make me to be able to fly, alright?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">I shook my head. &#x201C;There&#x2019; three situations to help you to fly. The first is that your battle spirit reaches a certain level that enables you to explode out with battle spirit that will allow you to escape the pull of gravity, but that way of flight takes up a lot of energy. The second is to increase your magic level to be able to control the wind elements thus enabling you to fly. The third is&#x2026;&#x2026;.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Fei Yu asked anxiously, &#x201C;What&#x2019;s the third way?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">I couldn&#x2019;t help but to think of Xiao Jin that was guarding the far away God Protector&#x2019;s Domain. I sighed and replied, &#x201C;The third way is to have a flying type Magical Beast to allow you to fly under its assistance.&#x201D; Xiao Jin was the King of Magical Beasts. It had been a long time since I had seen a Magical Beast after these years with my brothers that specialized in battle spirit. Initially, if it wasn&#x2019;t for Big Brother Hai Ri&#x2019;s red tiger that almost killed Xiao Jin, we wouldn&#x2019;t have reached such an intimate relationship. </span><i><span style="">&#x2018;Xiao Jin! Are you missing me right now?&#x2019;</span></i></p><p><span style="">Fei Yu chuckled. &#x201C;Magical Beast? I have one! Take a look at this. Soaring Feather! I choose you.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">To my astonishment, Fei Yu formed a hand seal towards the sky. A white light shone from her hand and a hexagonal boundary appeared in the sky. &#x2018;</span><i><span style="">Ah! This was the way of summoning life-sealed beast!</span></i><span style="">&#x2019; With a flash of light, the magic elements in the surrounding suddenly became chaotic. A snow white little bird appeared from the hexagonal boundary with a clear chirp, landing on Fei Yu&#x2019;s shoulder.</span></p><p><span style="">The white bird was about 3.3 meters long and was covered with snow-white feathers. Two of its red eyes looked at me with curiosity. There was also a small golden horn on its head, its body giving off weak power.</span></p><p><span style="">My heart was moved as I cried out, &#x201C;A Growth Type Magical Beast!&#x201D; Fei Yu was really worthy of being the princess from the Kingdom of Dalu to actually possess a Growth Type Magical Beast. I could clearly feel the aura from its body, even if I didn&#x2019;t know what type of white bird it was. Even though its power wasn&#x2019;t at its full potential, it definitely would be a low grade Growth Type Magical Beast. </span></p><p><span style="">Fei Yu said, slightly complacent, &#x201C;How is it? This is my Magical Beast. It&#x2019;s called Little Feather. Teacher, you said it can help to let me fly?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">I gradually recovered from my shocked state. &#x201C;Your Magical Beast is at the low grade level. Since it&#x2019;s a Growth Type Magical Beast, its power will slowly improve according to your cultivation so if you want it to allow you to fly, you must train your powers. It currently &#xA0;can&#x2019;t fully display its power.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Fei Yu pouted as she gently caressed Little Feather&#x2019;s snow-white wings. &#x201C;How long will that take? Teacher, since your magic is so powerful, don&#x2019;t you have a way to allow me to increase in my magic level in a short amount of time?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">I became serious. &#x201C;Don&#x2019;t you even think about that. Do you think training in magic is as easy as playing? Without bitter training, there won&#x2019;t be any results. Fei Yu, I really got something important at hand so I can&#x2019;t continue to take care of you. How about this then? I&#x2019;ll use a slightly bigger teleportation array to teleport you into the city. You won&#x2019;t be afraid of being caught by your pursuers from the Kingdom of Dalu that way.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Fei Yu expression grew distressed as she said, choked with emotions, &#x201C;Teacher&#x2026;.Teacher, you don&#x2019;t want me anymore? I&#x2019;m so pitiful! I&#x2019;m only a girl so what should I do when I meet with bad people? Teacher, please take me along with you. I&#x2019;ll obediently listen to you.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Hearing her pleas, I got a headache. &#x2018;</span><i><span style="">Why did I meddle with such a troublesome girl?! How can I bring her along with me to accept the Radiant God&#x2019;s inheritance?&#x2019;</span></i></p><p></p><hr><p></p>
