<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>Volume 4: Chapter 36 - Rolling like a Bottle Gourd</strong></span></p><p><span style="">Teacher Zhen smiled at Mu Zi and said, &#x201C;Mu Zi, why don&#x2019;t you give your wine to your teacher? You&#x2019;re a girl, so drinking too much wine is bad for your health.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Mu Zi carried out an action that rendered Teacher Zhen unable to cry or laugh. She drank the remaining fruit wine in one go and said, &#x201C;I&#x2019;m not drinking wine. I&#x2019;m only drinking fruit juice. </span><i><span style="">Hehe</span></i><span style="">!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Teacher Zhen was so angry that he silently glared at her and huffed into his beard.</span></p><p><span style="">The prince said, &#x201C;Please drink my wine. There are still so many dishes. Let&#x2019;s dig in!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">We were all waiting for him to say that. Mu Zi and I started to wipe out the dishes savagely. However, as there were many elders around, we must eat elegantly, but we didn&#x2019;t say a word and busied ourselves in eating. The leaders chatted and also ate food, so in a short period of time, the table was mostly cleared of food. </span></p><p><span style="">Teacher Zhen said, &#x201C;</span><i><span style="">Wah</span></i><span style="">! Zhang Gong, you&#x2019;re not only good at magic, you&#x2019;re also good at eating!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Teacher Di mockingly said, &#x201C;You don&#x2019;t know about this, but my precious disciple has a White Rice Bucket title.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">I awkwardly smiled and said, &#x201C;I&#x2019;m not good at magic, but eating. If it wasn&#x2019;t for the fact that I was lucky, I would have died at the hands of the Ri family&#x2019;s leader.&#x201D; Thinking back to that situation, I&#x2019;m still traumatized.</span></p><p><span style="">After saying that, I felt like I had divulged something to Mu Zi and peeked at her. She just seemed to be hurriedly eating and didn&#x2019;t pay any attention to what I said. I asked the prince, &#x201C;Uncle Ke Zha, how is the situation for the Ri family?&#x201D; &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">The prince sighed and said, &#x201C;I sent people to arrest them after the competition, but the entire Ri family seems to have disappeared into thin air. There wasn&#x2019;t anybody there, except for a few servants. It looks like Si Feng Ri had already prepared for this to happen. I&#x2019;ve ordered people to search for them, but the chances of finding them are very slim.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">I nodded and said, &#x201C;I wouldn&#x2019;t have thought that the honorable Ri family would support the evil forces.&#x201D; </span><span style="">In order to prevent unnecessary panic, I didn&#x2019;t tell them about the Monster King. How would I know that everyone had misunderstood that the Ri family is supporting the invasion of the Magic race, and brought unnecessary trouble to themselves.</span></p><p><span style="">Teacher Zhen said, &#x201C;Let&#x2019;s not talk about that now. Your Highness, can you serve more dishes? I&#x2019;m still not full yet. </span><i><span style="">Haha</span></i><span style="">.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The prince apologized for the unsatisfactory treatment of his guests and immediately told his servants to serve another course of dishes. Mu Zi and I dug in. The food that didn&#x2019;t lose out to the meal from Ascending Jade Tide unceasingly entered our mouths that were wide open like a bloody sacrificial bowl. </span></p><p><span style="">After the joyous meal ended, I secretly asked the prince for the &lt;&lt;Three Hundred Poems&gt;&gt; book. The prince told me that he found the book in some ruins. That book was one of a kind and was painstakingly preserved. If it wasn&#x2019;t me, I doubt that he would be able to give it away.</span></p><p><span style="">I accompanied Mu Zi and walked out of the prince mansion. I smiled and asked, &#x201C;How was it? Were you satisfied today?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Mu Zi coldly looked at me all of a sudden. &#x201C;Hmph! What about being satisfied? It&#x2019;s all your fault! With so many people around, I&#x2019;m not full yet.&#x201D; </span></p><p><i><span style="">&#x2018;Ah! She wasn&#x2019;t full? She ate a lot just now, but many of the movements were secretive.&#x2019;</span></i><span style=""> I replied, &#x201C;What to do? It can&#x2019;t be that you want to find another place to eat now, is it?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Mu Zi raised her head and looked at me with a playful look. &#x201C;That&#x2019;s unnecessary! However, you must remember that you owe me a meal at the Ascending Jade Tide.&#x201D; After she said that, she turned around and ran towards the direction of the academy as she let out peals of laughter.</span></p><p><span style="">I then understood and shouted, &#x201C;</span><i><span style="">Wah</span></i><span style="">! You tricked me!&#x201D; After I shouted, I chased after her.</span></p><p><span style="">As we were on the main road of the city, we didn&#x2019;t use any magic and just chased each other; Mu Zi could really run... Even though I had spent some time training, it was still quite difficult to catch her.</span></p><p><span style="">Once I saw that the entrance to the academy before me, I surveyed my surroundings and determined there weren&#x2019;t any people around. I used a short distance teleport to appear in front of Mu Zi. Mu Zi didn&#x2019;t have enough time to stop and fell into my arms. As her momentum was great, we immediately fell and rolled along the ground like a bottle gourd.</span></p><p><span style="">Mu Zi&#x2019;s head directly hit the left side of my face, which made me tear up in pain. Mu Zi held her head and exclaimed, &#x201C;So painful!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">After a while, I snapped back to reality from being in pain. Mu Zi was currently on top of me and continuously rubbed her head. Her body was so soft. I subconsciously placed my hands on her waist. Even though it was through her shirt, I could still feel the smoothness of her skin. </span></p><p><span style="">As I zoned out, Mu Zi noticed that something wasn&#x2019;t right and struggled to get out of my grasp. &#x201C;What are you doing? You pervert!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">I completely snapped back to reality at that moment and helped her up, but the feeling of hugging her had not disappeared.</span></p><p><span style="">Mu Zi&#x2019;s face reddened and she glared at me before pouting playfully, &#x201C;So it turns out that you&#x2019;re this bad!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">I screamed out injustice. &#x201C;How am I bad? You were the one that bumped into me.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Mu Zi unreasonably said, &#x201C;I don&#x2019;t care! It&#x2019;s your fault! If not, why did you suddenly appear in front of me? I&#x2019;m in so much pain right now from crashing into you. You see, I have such a big lump on my head. How am I going to see other people now?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">I gently caressed Mu Zi&#x2019;s head. There really was a small lump. It looked like the collision was not gentle. I teased her saying, &#x201C;</span><i><span style="">Wah</span></i><span style="">! Mu Zi, you have grown a horn! Haha.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Mu Zi pulled my ear, &#x201C;You&#x2019;re good! You do something wrong, but still laugh at my misfortune. I won&#x2019;t forgive you!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">I hurriedly said, &#x201C;I wouldn&#x2019;t dare! I&#x2019;ll help you treat it. I promise the lump will disappear.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Mu Zi curiously let go of my ear. &#x201C;Really? If you&#x2019;re lying to me, you&#x2019;re dead!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">It hurt my heart knowing that Mu Zi got hurt during the fall, so I gathered light elements in my hand and cast a light recovery spell on Mu Zi. </span></p><p><span style="">Mu Zi, who saw the white light in my hand, quickly retreated away from the light. &#x201C;What are you doing?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">I was stunned for a moment. &#x201C;I&#x2019;m helping you to treat your lump. Why? I&#x2019;m using the light recovery spell. The effect is not bad.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Mu Zi immediately shook her head. &#x201C;No! I don&#x2019;t need your treatment! I&#x2019;ve been sensitive to light elements ever since I was young.&#x201D;</span></p><p><i><span style="">&#x2018;Ah! There&#x2019;s such a thing of being sensitive to light elements? I hadn&#x2019;t heard about that.&#x2019; </span></i><span style="">I chuckled and said, &#x201C;You&#x2019;re really special. You&#x2019;re even sensitive to light elements. You&#x2019;re incredible! Since you can&#x2019;t be treated by me, let&#x2019;s go back to the academy to find a water mage to treat you. You definitely shouldn&#x2019;t be sensitive to water elements, right? </span><i><span style="">Haha</span></i><span style="">.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Mu Zi looked at me and said, &#x201C;It&#x2019;s inherited in my family. I also can&#x2019;t do anything about that. Let&#x2019;s hurry and head back to the academy.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">She unexpectedly took the initiative to hold my hand as we walked towards the academy.</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p>
