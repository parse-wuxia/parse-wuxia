All he could see was space continually being torn apart, the stray energy destroying the architecture. The defensive layer shook continually, and he couldn&#x2019;t help but look to Bowens in his worry..</p><p>&#x201C;Don&#x2019;t worry, they&#x2019;re fine! Morning Star Magi will not act without benefits, and Saka and the other Star rank fire elementals can&#x2019;t match up to you Emberwings.&#x201D; Bowens&#x2019; expression was slightly strange as he spoke.</p><p>&#x201C;I guess I can relax now.&#x201D; Schiker patted his chest, but his expression quickly changed. He had sensed something off about Bowens&#x2019; tone.</p><p>Bowens was much too knowledgeable about that black-robed person. On top of that, what did he mean by &#x2018;you Emberwings&#x2019;?</p><p>As he turned around and saw the strange expression on Bowens&#x2019; face, his heart sank. &#x201C;U&#x2013;Uncle Bowens, you&#x2026; heart sunk. &#x201C;Un-uncle Bowens, you&#x2026;&#x201D;</p><p>*Schlick!* Before the words left his mouth, a black scorpion had crawled onto his neck as a black stinger piercing into an artery.</p><p>The defence of eighth level Fireplume turned out to be useless. Schiker&#x2019;s eyes rolled up into their sockets, his consciousness lost.</p><p>&#x201C;What&#x2019;s going on? Officer Bowens has attacked Lord Schiker!&#x201D; The few remaining military officials mental strength crumbled at this sight. If this was a nightmare, all they wanted was to wake up from it as soon as possible.</p><p>&#x201C;This Schiker is a spy who I&#x2019;ve discovered long ago. Seize him! Do your duties!&#x201D;</p><p>Bowens&#x2019; large hand quickly sought out the gem at Schiker&#x2019;s neck, retrieving the key with the phantom image of a phoenix within it. His words caused the minds of the military officials present to short-circuit.</p><p>The illegitimate son that their leader thought so highly of, their Lord Schiker, was... a spy?</p><p>Many of them felt like they had just heard the joke of the year, but seeing the flame-ringed Bowens, the could not bring themselves to laugh.</p><p>&#x201C;Officer, please let Lord Schiker go!&#x201D;</p><p>Bowens was not completely in charge here. While the remaining Star rank commanders were either trapped outside or dead, their subordinates were still around. Even if Bowens&#x2019; own subordinates approved of his actions, these people would not.</p><p>&#x201C;What? You want to attack me?&#x201D; Energy at the tenth level of Fireplume exploded forth, and a large amount of flames formed the terrifying phantom of a phoenix. The energy was similar to a domain of flames, and put the entire area under Bowens&#x2019; control.</p><p>The official who had spoken of his suspicions was merely at the ninth level of Fireplume. Even though he was considered powerful among Sky ranks, he was nothing in front of Bowens.</p><p>He took several steps back, face flushing red as he stood straight, &#x201C;You have restrained Lord Schiker for no reason. Please provide proof that he is a spy, or else&#x2026;&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Or else?&#x201D; Crimson rays flashed, and the official who had just been speaking disappeared. All that was left on the ground was a pile of ashes.</p><p>&#x201C;Did you really think I wouldn&#x2019;t kill anyone?&#x201D; Bowens sneered, carrying the unconscious Schiker and heading towards the back of the residence. Many officials looked around at each other, but none followed.</p><p>Leylin looked at the other two dukes from their hiding spot in the shadows, &#x201C;What do you think?&#x201D;</p><p>Gilbert spoke slowly. &#x201C;Bowens is probably Jupiter&#x2019;s Lightning&#x2019;s real spy. Loke was most likely just a bait.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Mm! And what&#x2019;s more interesting, he&#x2019;s practised Fireplume to the tenth level&#x2026;&#x201D; Leylin&#x2019;s eyes glowed with curiosity. He had needed the A.I. Chip to modify Fireplume to harmonize with his point mass. How had this person done it? Furthermore, he couldn&#x2019;t have survived for so long as a spy without even Scarlet Eye finding out if he didn&#x2019;t have an Arcane Art that dealt in bloodlines. That was intriguing as well.</p><p>&#x201C;Whatever it is, Bowens picked a good time. Scarlet Eye is engaged, and the other Star ranks are fighting hard outside the residence. As long as Bowens has the fight outside under control, he had no need to fear for anything&#x2026;&#x201D;</p><p>Emma did not mention the rest of the military officials within the residence. In a Morning Star&#x2019;s eyes, anyone weaker than rank 4 was an ant. She didn&#x2019;t think that they could stop him.</p><p>As expected, once Bowens showed that he was not to be trifled with, many of the officials retreated, unwilling to go forth.</p><p>Bowens snorted and went deeper into the residence. Those who dared to hinder him were burnt to ashes under his flames.</p><p>&#x201C;What should we do next?&#x201D; Emma glanced at Leylin.</p><p>She could not make much sense of this young man at all. He was good at tolerating things, for one. Were she here alone, she would have struck out long ago. How could she have restrained herself until now, when the best benefits were available? Furthermore, the techniques he&#x2019;d used to conceal himself had duped even Bowens, which was amazing.</p><p>&#x201C;We&#x2019;re obviously going to follow him.&#x201D; Leylin chuckled, pointing at Bowens who was ahead.</p><p>&#x201C;He&#x2019;s definitely a spy from Jupiter&#x2019;s Lightning. He can be the scapegoat, taking all the damage from traps and conspiracies. We just need to follow him and get those firasource stones&#x2026;&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Haha&#x2026; As expected of a student of mine. Leylin&#x2026; you&#x2019;re definitely very sly. I like it!&#x201D; Gilbert burst out into laughter, looking delighted. Emma rolled her eyes at his response.</p><p>Bowens&#x2019; speed was very fast as he carried Schiker to a place that Leylin was familiar with. This was the area where Loke had used Gaia&#x2019;s Disc that day.</p><p>&#x201C;Could it be&#x2026;&#x201D; Leylin watched Bowens&#x2019; actions, realisation dawning upon him.</p><p>Soon enough, he saw Bowens take out a round plate, eyes on its surface formed from countless veins. He shook his head at Loke&#x2019;s previous actions, &#x201C;This is probably something used specifically to send equipment and confuse others&#x2026;&#x201D;</p><p>The earth split apart like an ocean, revealing a deep tunnel. Bowens smirked and darted in. Leylin and the two dukes glanced at each other and followed.</p><p>Very soon, the scarlet spell formation previously had appeared before Bowens, fragmented and drifting through the air like butterflies.</p><p>Bowens was very familiar with this place as he walked up to the huge secret room in the centre. A crimson spell formation in the middle of the room lit the place up, the light flickering at its edges.</p><p>A humming sound was produced as the formation let loose a layer of flames to block Bowens&#x2019; advance.</p><p>Bowens&#x2019; eyes only grew brighter at this. &#x201C;It&#x2019;s here!The barrier that Scarlet Eye set up himself.&#x201D;</p><p>Blue light gathered at his hands, flickering. At the same time, Schiker woke up from this period of unconsciousness.</p><p>His eyes were blurred for a moment, but he still immediately raised his guard. &#x201C;This&#x2026; The underground saferoom! Uncle Bowens, you actually betrayed us&#x2026;&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Look closely, kid. Who&#x2019;s your Uncle Bowens?&#x201D; &#x2018;Bowens&#x2019; sneered, his muscles and bones shifting. The red feathers that marked an Emberwing disappeared. In the blink of an eye, he had turned into a completely different person. The energy of a Morning Star domain burst forth.</p><p>&#x201C;So Uncle Bowens is already dead&#x2026;&#x201D; With this sight, Schiker heaved a sigh of relief. If it really was Bowens who had betrayed him and his father, he had no idea what to do.</p><p>&#x201C;Hehe&#x2026; Do you still not understand? I am Bowens, but Bowens isn&#x2019;t me! Whatever, the people of this land won&#x2019;t understand even if I explain it&#x2026;&#x201D; Bowens snickered, and that caused Schiker&#x2019;s heart to sink further.</p><p>&#x201C;If not for needing the tenth and higher levels of Fireplume as well as the blood aura of the leader to break through this barrier, do you think I&#x2019;d have brought you here?&#x201D; Bowens laughed coldly, preparing to make his move.</p><p>Schiker shook his head and closed his eyes.</p><p>&#x201C;It&#x2019;s better to wait!&#x201D; However, a familiar voice sounded by his ear, giving him the illusion that something was wrong with his ears.</p><p>&#x201C;Ley? Didn&#x2019;t he die in the square?&#x201D; Opening his eyes, he found &#x2018;Ley&#x2019; in front of him, and somehow, there were traces of&#x2026; fear, on Bowens&#x2019; face?</p><p>&#x201C;I knew something was off about you!&#x201D; Bowens watched Ley, his hands still trembling. Leylin had easily taken care of his attack, which that this person was at the same rank as him.</p><p>&#x201C;Must&#x2019;ve been a wild guess. That bait Loke can&#x2019;t have given you that much information!&#x201D; Leylin answered indifferently. As he was speaking, the characteristics of an Emberwing faded away. By the time he was done, he had morphed back into a black-haired, dreaded Warlock.</p><p>&#x201C;As expected, it&#x2019;s one of the remaining devilspawn of the Ouroboros Clan!&#x201D; Bowens gritted his teeth.</p><p>In the meanwhile, Schiker&#x2019;s jaw had dropped. He was dazed at the sight of this unfamiliar Morning Star Magus.</p><p>&#x201C;So&#x2026; So you&#x2019;ve been lying to me too? Haha&#x2026; You, Loke, you&#x2019;re all liars! Have you been treating me like a fool?&#x201D; Schiker roared, large droplets of tears falling from his cheeks. The cold-faced instructor from before had all but disappeared.</p><p>&#x201C;Did his mental wall crumble?&#x201D; Leylin shook his head, but had no plans of explaining himself.</p><p>Whatever the case may be, he&#x2019;d made use of Schiker and now he&#x2019;d repaid that by saving the Emberwing&#x2019;s life. In his mind, this act canceled out with all the help and guidance Schiker had given him.</p><p>He couldn&#x2019;t care less about Schiker&#x2019;s thoughts. If the man was so dumb as to attack or obstruct him, he would not hold back.</p><p></p><hr><p></p>
