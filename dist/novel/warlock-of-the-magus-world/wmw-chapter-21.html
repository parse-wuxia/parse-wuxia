<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>Kroft</strong></span></p><p>After the old man finished speaking, the acolytes were a little flustered.</p><p>&#x201C;What now? How should we choose?&#x201D; Beirut asked worriedly.</p><p>&#x201C;Paying is definitely better than not paying! This is common sense!&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;You should still have excess magic crystals, don&#x2019;t you?&#x201D; Leylin asked puzzledly.</p><p>&#x201C;But&#x2026;&#x2026; I only have 1 magic crystal left; my family sacrificed one thousand troops to get merely 2 magic crystals!&#x201D;</p><p>Beirut was a little reluctant. Leylin was startled too, as he could not help but feel his pockets.</p><p>&#x201C;The value of magic crystals is higher than I expected. When I extorted some from Ourin earlier, I really lucked out!&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;That&#x2019;s not right, the Chernobyl Islands is also known to Magi as the Barren Islands. magic crystals are already scarce, so the value of magic crystals being much higher here may be due to that!&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;A matter like this can only be decided by yourself!&#x201D; Leylin said to Beirut.</p><p>&#x201C;Alright! First up, Raynor!&#x201D; The old man said.</p><p>&#x201C;Which are you choosing?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;I&#x2026;...I don&apos;t have any magic crystals left, can I first buy on credit? I am a fourth-grade acolyte!&#x201D; Raynor blushed.</p><p>&#x201C;Not a bad aptitude! A pity, however, rules are rules!&#x201D; The old man shook his head.</p><p>As he pointed at a crystal ball on the table, Raynor&#x2019;s name appeared within, along with many other unfamiliar names, flickering as they appeared.</p><p>When the black python Spotty spat out a letter and dabbed on the crystal ball, the words finally stopped flickering, &#x201C;Raynor! Your mentor is Gafrin!&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Take this! A set of acolyte robes and an identity badge! A crystal ball which contains an elementary meditation technique! And your room number and keys are there too!&#x201D;</p><p>The old man threw the black sack containing the items to Raynor and then snapped his fingers. *Bang!* A black ball suddenly appeared in the room and floated in midair.</p><p>&#x201C;Follow this shadow slave, it will bring you to where your mentor is!&#x201D;</p><p>The old man made a gesture to send him off, and Raynor helplessly followed the black ball out.</p><p>&#x201C;Next! Rousey!&#x201D;</p><p>The one, who laughed at Dorotte earlier, Rousey, was called. Although his complexion had recovered a little, there was still cold sweat on his face.</p><p>&#x201C;Oh! What do I see? A nightmare hex! What a pitiful fellow! You&#x2019;re going to suffer for the next month!&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Could&#x2026;...Could you remove this hex?&#x201D; Rousey&#x2019;s voice quivered.</p><p>&#x201C;Definitely! One hundred magic crystals! No credit allowed!&#x201D; The old man agreed crisply!</p><p>Rousey shook his head and took a magic crystal from his robes, &#x201C;I want to choose my own mentor!&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;En!&#x201D; The old man accepted the magic crystal, and handed a compendium, which looked like a dictionary, to Rousey, &#x201C;The mentors who are willing to accept apprentices are all there, take your time and pick!&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Bang!&#x201D; An hourglass appeared on the table, the sand falling slowly.</p><p>&#x201C;I forgot to mention earlier, a magic crystal only allows for one turn of the hourglass. If you exceed it, you have to pay another magic crystal!&#x201D; The old man grinned.</p><p>Rousey swallowed his saliva, and looking at the sand grains falling non-stop, he flipped through the pages in a hurry.</p><p>&#x201C;This hourglass seems as though it lasts only 5 minutes worth of time! It is not even enough to skim through!&#x201D; Leylin&#x2019;s pupils shrank.</p><p>&#x201C;Time&#x2019;s up!&#x201D; In accordance with the voice, the compendium closed automatically and made a loud snapping sound.</p><p>&#x201C;How is it? Have you chosen? Or do you wish to have another look?&#x201D; The old man asked.</p><p>&#x201C;I have decided! I choose Mentor Vivian!&#x201D; Rousey sucked in a deep breath.</p><p>&#x201C;Take your belongings and follow the slave!&#x201D; The old man threw a black sack, identical to the one from before, to Rousey and summoned another shadow slave.</p><p>Rousey bowed humbly and followed the floating slave out the large doors.</p><p>&#x201C;Next up, Kaliweir!&#x2019;</p><p>The old man continued calling, and Leylin scrutinised the acolytes who went up. Kaliweir seemed well off, as he paid 3 magic crystals and looked through the compendium before making a choice.</p><p>&#x201C;As for Beirut, he did not pay the 1 magic crystal in the end. His mentor was chosen randomly, and he did not know if the results were good or bad.</p><p>&#x201C;Next! Leylin!&#x201D; The old man called Leylin&#x2019;s name.</p><p>Leylin inhaled deeply and walked to the front.</p><p>&#x201C;I&#x2019;ll choose on my own!&#x201D; Leylin handed a magic crystal to the old man.</p><p>&#x201C;You know the rules!&#x201D; The old man snapped, the hourglass flipped over, and time started elapsing.</p><p>The compendium was rather heavy, and the material seemed to be of high quality.</p><p>Leylin hurriedly flipped through the pages, and continuously skimmed through the information on the parchment.</p><p>&#x201C;It is the language of the Chernobyl Islands. It seems like it has been specially prepared for us acolytes of this area.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;A.I Chip! Record and extract the information!&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Mentor Lester, Department of Souls, specialises in transformation, neurology, and composition of radiation.&#x201D;</p><p>Able to provide information on 3 topics free of charge.</p><p>Requirements: The acolyte must assist in an experiment every month, and cannot be declined for any reason!&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Mentor Dorotte, Department of Shadow, specialises in anatomy, conversion of energy, and necromancy.&#x201D;</p><p>Requirements: acolytes must pay 1 magic crystal per month, and at the same time, cooperate with experiments!&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Mentor Kroft, Department of Potioneering, specialises in medicine, herbalism, and neutralisation of energy.&#x201D;</p><p>Able to provide information on 1 topic free of charge.</p><p>Requirements: acolytes must always help with the cleaning of the experimental lab, preparation and handling of various herbs, and at the same time, assist the Magus in carrying out herbal concoctions (on the basis that they cause no harm to the acolytes!)&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Mentor Estelle, Department of Curses, specialises in curses, dissecting of human anatomy, and soul studies.&#x201D;</p><p>Able to provide information on 5 topics free of charge. The category is chosen by the acolytes, and can guide acolytes in their studies at any given time!</p><p>Requirements: Cooperate with one experiment! Only one!&#x201D;</p><p>The pages flipped, and let out a rustling noise. By the time the last grain of sand fell, Leylin had managed to flip to the last page.</p><p>&#x201C;Your memory isn&apos;t bad, which is useful for your studies in the future! How is it? Who will you choose?&#x201D; The old man smiled and asked.</p><p>Leylin closed his eyes, &#x201C;A.I Chip! How is the collation of data?&#x201D;</p><p>[Beep! Data is in order, information on 53 mentors collated. In process of discarding the enticing conditions!]</p><p>Leylin&#x2019;s complexion turned bitter, &#x201C;The information in the brackets for Mentor Kroft earlier made me rather mindful. It seems like the experiments of Magi are dangerous, and can actually jeopardise the safety of the acolytes!&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Kroft is only doing experiments on herbal concoctions, but what of the others, like the shadow and necromancy experiments?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;No wonder the requirements given are so easy to meet, not needing to give payment for information. It was, in fact, so they could lure students who would cooperate for experimental testing! Although they might not have any adverse effects, it&#x2019;s all over once they do!&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;A.I Chip! Carry out the filtering process, with the conditions: To match with my current circumstances.&#x201D;</p><p>[Beep!] The blue light flashed, and the light blue screen in front of Leylin flickered. More than half of the mentors&#x2019; information was omitted, leaving only a miserable few choices, including Dorotte&#x2019;s.</p><p>&#x201C;Mentor Dorotte, Department of Shadow, specialises in anatomy, conversion of energy, and necromancy.&#x201D;</p><p>Requirements: acolytes must give one 1 magic crystal each month, and at the same time, cooperate with experiments!&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Mentor Kroft, Department of Potioneering, specialises in medicine, herbalism, and neutralisation of energy.&#x201D;</p><p>Able to provide information on 1 topic free of charge.</p><p>Requirements: acolytes must always help with the cleaning of the experimental lab, preparation and handling of various herbs, and at the same time, assist the Magus in carrying out herbal concoctions (on the basis that they cause no harm to the acolytes!)&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;It seems like Dorotte&#x2019;s temper isn&apos;t too bad amongst the mentors. If not, he wouldn&apos;t have gone to fetch the new batch of acolytes.&#x201D;</p><p>Leylin thought inwardly, &#x201C;A pity that my magic crystals are not enough, and he has Jayden already. I&#x2019;m afraid there will not be much attention given to me!&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Also the Shadow Department mentors all require acolytes to cooperate with their experiments and cannot ensure the safety of acolytes. This is such a fraud!&#x201D;</p><p>Leylin helpless omitted the mentors of the Shadow Department.</p><p>&#x201C;What&apos;s left is only this Alchemy mentor! With the extreme and unique advantages that I have with my A.I Chip, I can definitely make use of alchemy to earn money and buy knowledge related to the Dark element!&#x201D;</p><p>To others, Leylin had merely closed his eyes and made his choice right after opening them.</p><p>&#x201C;I choose Mentor Kroft!&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Alchemy?&#x201D; The old man was a little surprised, &#x201C;You wish to become an alchemist? The effort and resources invested are extremely horrifying! Do you want to change? I think Dorotte suits you well!&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Thank you, sir!&#x201D; Leylin earnestly bowed, &#x201C;I have a hobby for alchemy, and have also acquired some knowledge in this field beforehand.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;The mortal world&#x2019;s perception of alchemy is totally different from that of the world of Magi!&#x201D; The old man shook his head. Then, seeing Leylin&#x2019;s resolute gaze, he couldn&#x2019;t help but exclaim,</p><p>&#x201C;Since you have already decided, so be it!&#x201D; After speaking, the old man took a quill pen and scribbled on the parchment paper.</p><p>&#x201C;Here are your belongings, follow the shadow slave to where Kroft is!&#x201D;</p><p>The old man handed a sack over to Leylin.</p><p>Leylin bowed deeply and even nodded to the remaining acolytes, before leaving through the large door.</p><p>The black coloured ball floated in front and occasionally spun in a circle. Its speed was not too fast, and with Leylin&#x2019;s body of a peak Preparatory Knight, he easily followed along.</p><p>From time to time, there were acolytes passing, but they did not look at Leylin in astonishment.</p><p>Leylin followed the shadow slave and passed through several corridors, two large halls, and a garden. It then stopped in front of an area designed for experiment labs.</p><p>The shadow slave turned translucent, and immediately passed through the door, leaving Leylin outside.</p><p>Leylin was speechless, yet he did not dare knock on the door. Therefore, he just waited outside patiently.</p><p>After a moment, there came a middle-aged man&#x2019;s voice.</p><p>&#x201C;Leylin, huh? Enter!&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Yes!&#x201D; Leylin pushed opened the doors of the experimental lab.</p><p>A sweet and spicy aroma filled the laboratory room, mingling with the odour of poisonous fumes and liquids, which made Leylin furrow his brows.</p><p>A huge table took up the space of almost half the lab, and placed on it were various test tubes, flasks and beakers, as well as some other apparatus that Leylin could not identify. This made Leylin recall his previous life.</p><p>In front of the laboratory table, there stood a white-haired, middle-aged man who wore white robes. His collar was embroidered with golden patterns, and his eyes emitted a golden light, like two golden gems.</p><p>&#x201C;I&#x2019;m Kroft, and I&#x2019;ve heard the details from the shadow slave. So then, Leylin, are you willing to become my apprentice?&#x201D; The middle-aged man put down the test tube in his hands and said solemnly.</p><p></p><hr><p></p>
