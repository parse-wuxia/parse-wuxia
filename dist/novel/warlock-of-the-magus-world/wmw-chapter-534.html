<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>Morning Star Area</strong></span></p><p>&#x201C;Alright, we can make the trade in the Morning Star trading area!&#x201D; Leylin said after a moment and nodded. He then ended the call.</p><p>The point of the transaction was a small plane that was accessed and linked through the astral gate. It was the channel to which Cybel gave Leylin access for trading amongst Morning Star Warlocks.</p><p>That was a large camp and trading area built together by a few Radiant Moon Warlocks, and Leylin was delighted.</p><p>Though his Magus Tower and astral gate were still under construction, he could still travel through another astral gate.</p><p>While pondering over this, Leylin entered a large honeycomb-like structure in the technological section.</p><p>Here was an astral gate that could be used.</p><p>&#x201C;Your Grace!&#x201D; Schadt brought a group of Warlocks in white coats that looked very much like researchers from his previous world, and bowed to Leylin.</p><p>&#x201C;En! I want to use the astral gate here. The rest of you can leave first.&#x201D; Leylin waved his arms, sending Schadt and the rest away.</p><p>With his current status, Schadt did not dare say more. He immediately brought his subordinates away, giving up the spacious laboratory to Leylin.</p><p>&#x201C;Astral Gate!&#x201D; Leylin saw a giant stone gate in the spell formation at the centre.</p><p>Around the stone gate were blue flames that formed a giant bundle of light and covered everything. If Leylin wasn&#x2019;t at the Morning Star realm, he might not even see the true body constructed of astral stones.</p><p>The stone gate was simple yet dignified, spatial runes roving around and revolving every once in a while as they emanated a unique luster.</p><p>&#x201C;Astral plane! What a vast, wide place. I wonder if I&#x2019;ll be able to explore it to its depths in my lifetime&#x2026;&#x201D; Leylin sighed. He had a premonition. Perhaps&#x2026; When he completely understood the secrets of the astral plane, he would achieve his goal of immortality!</p><p>[Beep! Astral gate opened. Please determine coordinates!] The A.I. Chip&#x2019;s robotic voice sounded.</p><p>The giant stone gate emitting blue astral light began to rumble, a large black whirlpool appearing in the middle. Boundless silver spatial rays shot out from within, as well as a vast, mysterious astral aura.</p><p>&#x201C;Go!&#x201D; With a wave of his hand, a point of light that was like a star landed on the astral gate.</p><p>These were the coordinates to the Morning Star trading area that Paul had given him. After the A.I. Chip had recorded it down, he could use soul force and turn the location into a point of light.</p><p>The coordinates of different worlds and plans were very different from the 2D plane coordinates in Leylin&#x2019;s previous life. It was definitely not 3D either, but something that constantly warped and jumped in curves. At the same time, they seemed to have some point of reference in the astral plane and formed a specific frequency.</p><p>Even with the powerful calculative abilities of the A.I. Chip, it was still unable to simulate the entire process. Only through continuous use could it be completely understood.</p><p>When the point of light that was like a star landed on the surface of the stone gate, a startling change happened.</p><p>*Bzzzz!* The astral gate trembled, the countless wandering runes emitting an alarming luster. The two sides of the gate opened with a rumble, revealing a spatial passageway that was like a galaxy.</p><p>&#x201C;As expected, the consumption is very little. Just the reserves of astral stones that I borrowed can be used for three days or more!&#x201D;</p><p>Leylin was in no hurry to enter, only watching the A.I. Chip as it recorded data, and couldn&#x2019;t help but nod.</p><p>The operating rules of the astral gate still had to abide by the most fundamental physical laws. The further the teleportation, the greater the consumption. The Morning Star trading region was at the edges of the Magus World, and the consumption was obviously low, to the point that it was negligible. It was very convenient in moving manpower or cargo.</p><p>&#x201C;Hm? That&#x2019;s not right! This Morning Star area is obviously a strategic location for large bases and war movements of high-ranked Warlocks!&#x201D; Leylin was startled, but immediately understood.</p><p>With a point of communication in the Morning Star area, as long as organisations had Morning Star Warlocks and astral gates, they could be sent aid from the Morning Star area through astral gates, and could even have Warlocks from the union lend their support!</p><p>It could be said that the Morning Star area, along with the astral gates, was a huge teleportation network that linked all bloodline Warlock organisations</p><p>&#x201C;What an amazing plan! Such a convenient method of receiving aid, and very flexible as well. It&#x2019;s no wonder that bloodline Warlock organisations are spread throughout the central continent, and are still so close. There doesn&#x2019;t seem to be any issues that might divide them&#x2026;&#x201D;</p><p>The more Leylin thought about it, the more clear it was. He couldn&#x2019;t help but begin to admire those Radiant Moon Warlocks for their thoughts and decision.</p><p>Of course, the requirements to enter the teleportation formation was very high. There needed to be at least one Morning Star Warlock or above, as well as an astral gate.</p><p>Any one of the Dukes of the Ouroboros Clan could have sent for help from the Morning Star region through the astral gate. The invaders would immediately be destroyed, and Leylin would not have had to risk his life alone.</p><p>At this thought, Leylin had little to say.</p><p>If he had obtained the coordinates to the Morning Star region earlier, things would not have been so difficult for him, to the point that he needed to gamble on some things.</p><p>However, it wasn&#x2019;t too late. The connection between the Ouroboros Clan and the Morning Star area was established once again, and he could obtain reinforcements any time. He would not have to be as cautious as before.</p><p>Leylin laughed, a trace of dark soul force emitting from the area between his brows and into the passageway.</p><p>Since it was the first time he was making contact with the Morning Star area, he would not put himself in danger. On top of that, the consumption of having his body going through as compared to just his soul force was much higher. Using his soul force would save a lot of energy.</p><p>It had to be said that sometimes, Leylin was a very miserly Magus.</p><p>The spatial travel was very quick this time, and the repercussions were mild. Leylin focused his mind on the soul force, and immediately felt it going through the astral gate and linking with another small-scaled plane.</p><p>&#x201C;Foreigner, this is the gathering area of bloodline Warlocks. State your name and status!&#x201D;</p><p>Just as the soul force reached the outer regions of the plane, Leylin felt a powerful undulation being transmitted to him. That was the bloodline aura unique to Radiant Moon Warlocks, ruthlessly scanning Leylin&#x2019;s soul force.</p><p>&#x2018;A Radiant Moon Warlock, and their real body at that! This must be the protector in charge of the Morning Star area,&#x2019; Leylin wondered inside, his soul force emitting a stream of information.</p><p>&#x201C;I am Leylin Farlier of the Ouroboros Clan.&#x201D; At the same time, the dark soul force instantly sent out a layer of crimson brilliance, with the aura of the Kemoyin bloodline.</p><p>The unique power of a Warlock&#x2019;s bloodline, as well as the aura of the Giant Kemoyin Serpent, symbolised his status. It was a mark that was difficult for others to imitate.</p><p>&#x201C;En! Cybel&#x2019;s brought you up before, and the bloodline power is correct. Welcome home, little guy!&#x201D; The conscient immediately turned friendly, sending Leylin some words of encouragement and retreating into the other plane.</p><p>Leylin&#x2019;s soul force did not hesitate and followed him in.</p><p>&#x201C;Is this the Morning Star area?&#x201D; A streak of dark light formed a black human figure. Leylin couldn&#x2019;t help but look around, fascinated.</p><p>He was now in a large square. Raising his head, he could see a shattered sky, with nebulae and giant protective stars and the like in the spatial cracks.</p><p>Above some of the protective stars, there was a huge ring of light that was even larger than the sun, looking as if it was about to fall.</p><p>High-ranked Warlocks could be seen walking around the square on occasion. Compared to the small-scaled gathering before, Leylin now saw even more Morning Star Warlocks, and with some, he could not even sense the source of their bloodline.</p><p>This was the point where high-ranked bloodline Warlocks in the central continent gathered, and naturally could not be compared to the last time.</p><p>Leylin began to observe carefully. The Warlocks here were naturally at the Morning Star realm and above, their bodies all having unique auras. Some looked completely different from regular humans just from their outer appearance.</p><p>It was evident that this was not their first time here. They were not surprised by Leylin&#x2019;s presence in the square, going about their own matters.</p><p>Some of them had descended with their real bodies, while there were others like Leylin with just a thread of their soul force changed into flames, bundles of light, or other shapes.</p><p>&#x201C;Paul, I&#x2019;m here!&#x201D; Leylin&#x2019;s soul force turned into a rune and sent out a message to the imprint.</p><p>Almost instantly, he received a reply, &#x201C;Welcome, welcome! Are you at the square? Wait, I&#x2019;ll come get you!&#x201D;</p><p>Minutes later, a large steel puppet reached the square, its sapphire eyes shooting out light and immediately finding Leylin&#x2019;s location.</p><p>Identifying people by their soul force was the main method Morning Star Warlocks used to distinguish people. They were rarely wrong.</p><p>Seeing Leylin staring at his puppet, Paul couldn&#x2019;t help but chuckle, &#x201C;Haha&#x2026; my friend! It&#x2019;s your first time here. I&#x2019;ll gift you a steel puppet soon, since it&#x2019;s slightly inconvenient without a body!&#x201D;</p><p>Morning Star Warlocks used astral stones very sparingly, and if it was not necessary, they would not try to pass through with their real bodies. Instead, through their soul force, they would prepare a clone or puppet, and things would be fine.</p><p>The black figure formed from the thread of Leylin&#x2019;s soul force laughed and spoke, &#x201C;This isn&#x2019;t bad either. Aren&#x2019;t you going to bring me around?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Of course!&#x201D; The large steel puppet immediately led the way, every step causing an earthquake, attracting the attention of many Warlocks.</p><p>&#x201C;This is the Morning Star area, the holy land of bloodline Warlocks. It&#x2019;s also where all our strength and hope lies!&#x201D; Paul explained.</p><p>&#x201C;You should understand how trading and everything works, right?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Of course. A network of teleportation spell formations spanning across the central continent! As expected, it&#x2019;s a huge project!&#x201D; Leylin sucked in a deep breath.</p><p></p><hr><p></p>
