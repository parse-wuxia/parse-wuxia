<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>The Hocada Beast</strong></span></p><p>Leylin searched the other party&#x2019;s body at the speed of light. His eyes lit up as he tugged the red gemstone off the other party&#x2019;s ear.</p><p>Using his spiritual force to swiftly explore the inside of the pendant, an astral stone the size of a fingernail immediately came into view.</p><p>&#x201C;Brilliant!&#x201D; As expected, Vance had indeed lied about the intelligence that he had gathered before he died. He had always been carrying the astral stone around.</p><p>Not only that, there were certain materials that were kept inside the earrings that surprised Leylin.</p><p>&#x201C;The Diamond Jellyfish&#x2026;&#x201D; Leylin couldn&#x2019;t help but smile as he glanced upon something that seemed like a crystal figure.</p><p>&#x201C;This is indeed a genuine first-rate material that is capable of increasing the chances of breaking through to the Crystal Phase by 35%. No wonder the other party was so confident in advancing.&#x201D; He couldn&#x2019;t help but take a look at his own condition.</p><p>[Leylin Farlier. Rank 3 Warlock (Hydro Phase). Bloodline: Giant Kemoyin Serpent, Strength: 30, Agility: 30, Vitality: 45.5, Spiritual Force: 315.6, Magic Power: 315 (Magic power in synchronisation with spiritual force)]</p><p>It had been a while since Leylin had advanced to the Hydro Phase. In recent times, he had always used the power of his bloodline to increase his spiritual force, instead of using spiritual force potions.</p><p>After a century of disuse, his body&#x2019;s resistance to potions had almost completely worn out.</p><p>As long as he used this potion once more, he should be able to fulfill the requirements of Crystal Phase.</p><p>&#x201C;Vance has indeed given me many good things!&#x201D; Not only that, most of the things that Vance had painstakingly prepared to break through to the Crystal Phase were also useful for Leylin. This had indeed saved Leylin a lot of trouble to search for them.</p><p>He couldn&#x2019;t help but laugh out loud.</p><p>The Coin of Destiny had indeed guided him well. Vance was practically his lucky star, although the man himself would not think that way.</p><p>&#x201C;Found you!&#x201D; Number 5 descended in front of Leylin, emitting terrifying Crystal Phase energy waves.</p><p>&#x201C;Leo didn&#x2019;t follow you? This is indeed disappointing!&#x201D; Leylin looked at Number 5 and shook his head as his face showed regret.</p><p>&#x201C;How dare you? Even though you&#x2019;ve just killed a Hydro Phase Magus, you can&#x2019;t belittle the dignity of a Crystal Phase Magus!&#x201D;</p><p>Number 5&#x2019;s face hardened as he gathered and concentrated the spiritual force all over his body.</p><p>&#x201C;I should inform you that I didn&#x2019;t just kill a Rank 3 Hydro Phase Magus, I also killed a Magus that just broke through to the Crystal Phase not long ago.</p><p>&#x201C;Just in time, the specimen that I had gained previously seemed a little weak, maybe I should gather another one&#x2026;&#x201D; Upon hearing Leylin&#x2019;s words, Number 5&#x2019;s expression darkened.</p><p>Number 5 looked at Leylin who laughed indifferently, and suddenly felt like what he&#x2019;d done was ridiculously dumb.</p><p>Yet, it was too late as there was a black ray of light concentrating on Leylin&#x2019;s finger&#x2026;.</p><p>&#x2026;&#x2026;</p><p>&#x201C;I&#x2019;ll remember this, Oakheart Clan!&#x201D; On the other hand, a hawk-nosed Magus, with terrible wounds and even scars that were created from spell formations, was currently fleeing in disarray.</p><p>Even though he has already reached a high level of the Crystal Phase, and his spiritual force is only a few steps away from peaking the Crystal Phase, he was still unable to defend himself from the combined attacks of three Crystal Phase Magi. He lost tragically and even suffered serious injuries.</p><p>In particular, the leader Leo could be said to be this Magus&#x2019; nightmare. He brought along a high-energy creature which was the main cause of his injuries.</p><p>What made him even angrier was that he was unable to escape Leo&#x2019;s clutches even when he changed his aura. This meant that the other party had left a mark on him.</p><p>Unfortunately, no matter how hard he tried, he was unable to find out what exactly the other party had done. The fact that even his communications equipment was restricted made him realize the disparity between the two parties, driving him insane.</p><p>&#x201C;Oakheart Clan, I will definitely expose your dirty tricks to the entire world!&#x201D; the hawk-nosed Magus howled in desperation as he soon found himself cornered by the three.</p><p>&#x201C;You&#x2019;ll never get the chance!&#x201D; Leo showed a ruthless expression as he concentrated a terrifying amount of energy fluctuations on his body.</p><p>In that instant, the shadow of a beast that appeared behind him gradually took form as it stood in front of the hawk-nosed Magus.</p><p>That creature howled, making an unpleasant sound.</p><p>This creature seemed to be a combination of a wolf and a squid. It has the head and the body of a wolf and yet its lower body was equipped with white tentacles, complete with suction pads, that sent shivers down one&#x2019;s spine.</p><p>The creature, which had eyes that looked like green lightbulbs, stared intensely at the Magus. At the same time, there were traces of dark green gases being emitted from the suction pads.</p><p>The gas then concentrated on the hawk-nosed Magus&#x2019; body, forming a thick layer of adhesive that caused him to slow down.</p><p>*Roar!* The tentacles, located at the lower body of the creature, bloomed like a flower as they headed towards the hawk-nosed Magus.</p><p>Leo watched in pleasure as the creature swallowed the hopeless fellow into its stomach. The creature&#x2019;s stomach didn&#x2019;t stop squirming as if it was digesting the entire body.</p><p>It was always the same cycle. Those he pursued would first curse him, then fear him and his creature, and ultimately they wouldn&#x2019;t be able to escape their fate of death. Witnessing these Magi eventually die was always a heartfelt pleasure for him.</p><p>Even though this current target was not a beautiful and skilled female Magus, the fact that he was from an affluent family was enough to make up for his loss.</p><p>&#x201C;This Hocada Beast&#x2026;&#x201D; Suddenly, the creature wrapped itself with its uncountable hands, forming a humongous meat lump and even breathing like a human being.</p><p>&#x201C;It&#x2019;s almost reached the stage of evolution. Once it evolves, I&apos;m afraid&#x2026;&#x201D; Leo&#x2019;s expression darkened.</p><p>This unique Hocada Beast originally belonged to his Morning Star Magus grandfather who found it among the debris of another plane.</p><p>The creature was now merely in its infancy, and could still swallow terrifying Crystal Phase magi. Once it was fully grown and its ability increased, only his Master Grandfather would be capable of subduing it.</p><p>*Snap!* A sharp and clear sound could be heard from Leo&#x2019;s chest as he stared blankly.</p><p>He couldn&#x2019;t believe it as he took out a rhombus-shaped crystal from his embrace and saw the surface being filled with cracks and at the same time, it wasn&#x2019;t shining.</p><p>Number 1 and Number 2 couldn&#x2019;t help but narrowed their eyes.</p><p>&#x201C;This is&#x2026; the crystal that seals the spirit source. Which comrade perished?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Number 5. But how is that possible? The other party is only a Hydro Phase&#x2026;&#x201D;</p><p>Leo hated this feeling as it meant that things went beyond his control. &#x201C;Exactly what happened? Which Magus concealed his capability? Or was it merely sheer luck that a high-ranked Magus helped him? Drat, there are so many possibilities&#x2026;.&#x201D;</p><p>Leo&#x2019;s expression turned ferocious: &#x201C;Number 1, Number 2&#x2026; I want you&#x2026;&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Buzz!&#x201D; Just at this time, a subtle energy wave was transmitted from Leo&#x2019;s ring in the form of a blue ray of light as an image was projected in the sky.</p><p>In this image was a blue-haired Magus with eyes, more brilliant than the stars.</p><p>&#x201C;Master Grandfather!&#x201D; Leo bowed respectfully while Number 1 and Number 2 knelt on the ground as they shivered. The dignity of a Morning Star Magus could not be violated even if you were at the Crystal Phase.</p><p>The expression of the Magus in the image was awful: &#x201C;I felt a portion of the dispatched stardust bugs being destroyed.&#x201D;</p><p>Leo narrowed his eyes. The fact that the Oakheart Clan made use of stardust bugs to spy on each and every move of the Magi was a top secret and the consequences would be dire if this secret was to be exposed.</p><p>Even the Azure Mountain King, who was also a Morning Star Magus, would not be able to appease the anger of the numerous Magi.</p><p>Adding on, once the female Morning Star Magi found out that their conduct and deeds were&#x2026;. Leo didn&#x2019;t dare to even think about it anymore.</p><p>&#x201C;No matter what, this has to be resolved immediately. Luckily, the last information that was sent through the stardust bugs is that the other party is not of a high rank, not even to the extent of nearing the Morning Star realm. Go to the location with these coordinates first, I&#x2019;ll arrive soon!&#x201D;</p><p>The Azure Mountain King&#x2019;s tone was pressing and commanding. He&#x2019;d emphasized on the matter at hand when he hung up.</p><p>&#x201C;These coordinates?&#x201D; Leo looked at the information that the Azure Mountain King had sent him as his eyes narrowed into a line.</p><p>He remembered very clearly that these coordinates located the direction that the Magus who had killed Number 5 fled to.</p><p>The scene of his confrontation with the other party flashed in his head.</p><p>He remembered the other party&#x2019;s calm voice and realised how foolish he was back then. Maybe back then, the other party had already seen through his tricks and found a way to free himself as he awaited Leo&#x2019;s arrival.</p><p>Once he thought about it, he&#x2019;d truly been inane! Leo&#x2019;s expression dropped instantly, now as gloomy as rain.</p><p>&#x201C;Follow me!&#x201D; Leo&#x2019;s voice was very dry, as if he was dying of thirst in the desert. Number 1 and Number 2 looked at each other and helplessly forced a smile.</p><p>Based on the conversation just now, they had already guessed that something serious had happened and they were aware of the consequences of knowing too much.</p><p>This was the sad part of being controlled by someone else. Even if they knew they were at a disadvantage, they would not dare to rebel.</p><p>&#x201C;Humph!&#x201D; Leo turned his head away coldly as Number 1 and Number 2 followed closely behind him.</p><p>The stardust bugs were top secret. In past history, only the leader of the Oakheart Clan and the Azure Mountain King knew of them. Since these two heard the name, they were already destined for death.</p><p>Maybe the Azure Mountain King had already thought of this. He was only delaying their deaths because he had a use for them.</p><p>It was important to clean all evidence once the deed was done. After all, no one could know of the clan&#x2019;s biggest secret&#x2026;</p><p>*Thump!* Number 5&#x2019;s body fell on the floor with a small black hole in his forehead.</p><p>&#x201C;Not bad!&#x201D; Leylin&#x2019;s breathing was unstable. After all, it was not an easy task to deal with a rank 3 Crystal Phase Magus. Yet, as he looked at Number 5&#x2019;s ring, his expression brightened.</p><p></p><hr><p></p>
