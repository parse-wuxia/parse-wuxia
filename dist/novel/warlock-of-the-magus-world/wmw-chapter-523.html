<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>Plan and Operation</strong></span></p><p>Cybel glanced at Leylin.</p><p>&#x201C;I can take on three. It won&#x2019;t be a problem to take care of the remaining one, right? After all, you managed to kill Demon Hunter Cyril. I look forward to witnessing you opening the battle with your great skills, hopefully ending quickly and assisting others!&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;No problem!&#x201D; Leylin stroked his nose.</p><p>Cybel seemed to be at the peak of the Morning Star realm and could even take on three Morning Star Magi at the same time. No wonder the other Warlocks respected him so.</p><p>After the deployment had been settled, Cybel heaved a heavy sigh, his tone tinged with regret.</p><p>&#x201C;Actually, Leylin, if your mentors were present, we would be at a great advantage. Pity&#x2026; But it&#x2019;s all too late now! Besides, you and you alone can take care of this matter, we can only furnish you with logistical assistance!&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;It would be good enough to have all of this!&#x201D; Leylin quickly declared.</p><p>It was fundamentally impossible for one organisation to interfere and provide military support to another. It was an extremely easy way to seize power.</p><p>In the event that Cybel had deliberately tricked Gilbert and the rest, causing them to perish in their search for &#x2018;Purgatory&#x2019;, it would be too late for the Ouroboros Clan to even shed tears.</p><p>Although the possibility of this happening was slim, prevention was better than a cure.</p><p>As such, Cybel and the rest had to remain low-key to avoid attracting suspicion.</p><p>&#x201C;Alright! We&#x2019;ll set off immediately, and head towards the Crystal Mountains. This time, we need to get our hands on the historical remains of Scarlet Crescent!&#x201D; Cybel waved his hand in the air, emanating a heroic spirit.</p><p>The other Morning Stars&#x2019; eyes gleamed with a thirst for success.</p><p>&#x2026;&#x2026;</p><p>At a Magus military base.</p><p>The entire place was covered with detection towers and barriers, sinister-looking steel puppets and bio-beasts alongside fangs and cannons.</p><p>From time to time, spiritual force undulations of Crystal Phase Magi could be felt as they swept through the area on patrol. In fact, there was even the terrifying aura of an occasional Morning Star Magus, causing the most ferocious of mutated beasts to be petrified and whimper in fear.</p><p>&#x201C;We do not know the concrete location of the historical remains, though we do know that there are a total of thirteen likely sites. Five of them are in our hands and the rest are with the opposite side. This place is one of their military bases. The ones keeping watch here are the hunter Borick and the Marine Giant Siebel&#x2026;&#x201D;</p><p>The silhouettes of Leylin and Philip appeared at the heavily guarded military base.</p><p>&#x201C;The convergence of the sun, stars and moon and the appearance of the Oake&#x2019;s arc is very soon!&#x201D;</p><p>Leylin&#x2019;s eyes sparkled. With the help of the A.I. Chip, his calculations of the star&#x2019;s trajectory was much more advanced and accurate than the many astrologers on the continent.</p><p>The lower right corner of the A.I. Chip&#x2019;s interface stated the time clearly: 1 hour 24 minutes!</p><p>Ridiculously, Cybel and the others believed that the historical remains would appear in these two days and they were seizing the military bases everywhere.</p><p>It requires a huge amount of calculating and researching to determine where the remains would appear. Even Jupiter&#x2019;s Lightning along with Cybel and his men could only conclude that these thirteen locations were likely.</p><p>As for Leylin, he was certain that this base was more than 80% likely to be the location!</p><p>This was due to the amazing processing power of the A.I. Chip. With him joining the union, Cybel had revealed all information associated with the place. Thus, unknown to him, Leylin was able to determine both a time and a place for the reappearance.</p><p>Leylin guarded the secret of the A.I. Chip fiercely and would obviously not reveal anything. He only fought for the opportunity to be bestowed this mission and then watched Cybel assign the subsequent missions.</p><p>&#x201C;It&#x2019;s almost time to start!&#x201D; Philip looked at the pocketwatch in his hand.</p><p>Leylin turned to look at the Wind Wolf Warlock. According to his calculations, this location looked to be the entrance to the historical remains, and Philip along with himself would, unfortunately, be the first Magi to enter and explore.</p><p>&#x2018;With him here, Cybel and the others will be attracted to come over. I will have no need to worry about being a lone soldier&#x2026;&#x2019;</p><p>Leylin was very generous. Besides the point that it was mentioned in the contract that one should not attack their own ally, he would not be able to pocket such huge portion of historical remains alone.</p><p>The starting time Philip spoke about was the time they&#x2019;d agreed on to launch their combined offensive. Before the Radiant Moon Magus from the Jupiter&#x2019;s Lightning was pinned down, no one was willing to make the first move.</p><p>At this moment, a wave of frenzied energy passed through the area. It was close enough to hear the rumbles from where it passed.</p><p>Leylin could faintly see the image of a three-headed golden-yellow lion appearing, dragging a Magus whose body was covered in lightning images into a struggle.</p><p>&#x201C;This is the power of the Radiant Moon?&#x201D; Leylin looked at the golden lion and his face revealed a faint sense of loss.</p><p>This was a rank 5 Warlock, someone who walked the path of the bloodline as well! The guidance he could get from this was incomparable to anything else.</p><p>&#x201C;This is the clone of Lord Wayde, the &#x2018;Golden Lion&#x2019;!&#x201D; Philip&#x2019;s tone was filled with respect, and Leylin&#x2019;s eyes opened wide in amazement.</p><p>&#x201C;What?&#x201D; He pointed at the lion&#x2019;s golden heads in disbelief; they were spouting fire, ice, and lightning at the same time. &#x201C;This is just a clone? How formidable is his true form?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;We Warlocks are rightfully much stronger than the Magi!&#x201D; Philip proudly declared, &#x201D;Lord Wayde is one of the main pillars of support of the Warlock Union. His true form is feared even by Breaking Dawn Magi. One clone is enough to deal with a mere Radiant moon Magus.&#x201D;</p><p>During their conversation, Leylin saw that the aura that emitted from the phantom of the three headed lion formed a lightning cage that dragged the Radiant Moon Magus into a spatial rift.</p><p>&#x201C;Damn! Be careful, I&#x2019;m sure they have more cards up their sleeves!&#x201D; The moment the rift began to close, an unwilling violent yell was transmitted that echoed throughout Crystal Mountain.</p><p>The men at the base Leylin was at had been initially woken by the strong energy undulations. Now the uproar was even more direct, and two streaks of strong Morning Star undulations appeared.</p><p>&#x201C;To draw away the enemy, we will have to expose ourselves, this is an inevitable price to pay!&#x201D;</p><p>Philip heaved a deep sigh, &#x201C;It&#x2019;s our move now!&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Indeed!&#x201D; Leylin nodded his head in agreement. Soon after, he saw the image of an ancient Wind Wolf the size of a mountain manifesting behind the other Warlock.</p><p>This enormous green wolf&#x2019;s body was covered with a layer of spike-like fur, all standing on end with a steely lustre. Its eyes were glowing with a bloodthirsty aura, and a huge storm covered it, forming a bizarre form of armour.</p><p>&#x201C;Rank 4 spell&#x2014; Storm Annihilation!&#x201D;</p><p>Philip&#x2019;s voice was deep and gloomy. He did not have the courage to use the Morning Star Arcane Art in the central continent, however regular rank 4 spells were not off the table.</p><p>The phantom wolf howled in sync with Philip.</p><p>The distant and gloomy howl was extremely piercing and travelled far. Huge wind elemental particles violently came together forming a strong convection current and finally creating a strong violent storm.</p><p>Storm Annihilation! This was exactly what Leylin had employed at the West Seas Canyon to destroy the Azure Mountain King&#x2019;s clone. It had appeared here once more, this time at a much larger scale.</p><p>&#x201C;Stop it!&#x201D; A flustered and exasperated voice emerged and two streaks of light shot over.</p><p>&#x201C;Haha&#x2026; It&#x2019;s too late&#x2026;&#x201D; Philip laughed heartily, hastening the effect of the Storm Annihilation to mercilessly crush the military base.</p><p>The violent winds whistled. In the face of a storm that had the ability to destroy anyone below the Morning Star realm, the heavy guard of the military base was a joke.</p><p>Countless puppets and the mutated beasts turned to dust, followed by a huge number of Magi and buildings runes etched into them.</p><p>&#x201C;Stop them, don&#x2019;t let them rescue the others!&#x201D;</p><p>Philip and Leylin firmly obstructed the way of the two Morning Star Magi, stopping them from helping the others.</p><p>Soon after, the black storm was over, the original military base razed to the ground. The ground itself had sunk down a few layers.</p><p>In front of a Morning Star, everyone else and any spells cast were as good as nothing!</p><p>&#x201C;You&#x2026; &#x201C; Two silhouettes emerged, glaring at Leylin and Philip.</p><p>One of them was a dwarf with a huge wooden bow on his back, the other a blue-skinned brute who was over three meters tall.</p><p>An enormous amount of pressure was released from both their bodies.</p><p>&#x201C;Hunter Bolix and Marine Giant Siebel!&#x201D; Philip gave a wide smile, revealing the sharp teeth in his mouth, &#x201C;I want the Hunter, you can have the Marine Giant!&#x201D;</p><p>The dwarf with the wooden bow smiled sarcastically as dark green whirlwind sprang forth from his body. He was a Wind Element Morning Star Magus and had been dissatisfied with Philip for a long time.</p><p>&#x201C;No problem!&#x201D; Leylin moved a few steps to the side and obstructed the way of the blue giant.</p><p>&#x201C;Let&#x2019;s change the battlefield, shall we?&#x201D; Philip eyed the opposing dwarf with provocation in his eyes. The huge phantom wolf exposed its sharp teeth.</p><p>&#x201C;Humph!&#x201D; The dwarf opposite him snorted coldly, grabbing the huge wooden bow from his back.</p><p>Space cracked apart in the between them, forming a huge rift. The spatial ripples were as if a curtain that was being drawn, and Philip and Bolix were gone in the next moment.</p><p>&#x201C;We do not need to change location, let&#x2019;s settle it here!&#x201D; Leylin locked eyes with the giant in front of him and smirked.</p><p>As the damage from clashes between Morning Star Magi was great and extensive, they usually made their moves in spatial rifts to prevent harming the Magus world.</p><p>With Leylin&#x2019;s words, Marine Giant Siebel&#x2019;s face hardened.</p><p>For a Morning Star Magus to dare to fight in the open, they were either crazy or absolutely confident in their power control. Evidently, this Warlock was of the latter category.</p><p></p><hr><p></p>
