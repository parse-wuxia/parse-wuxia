<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>Toram</strong></span></p><p>&#x201C;Master! You may have overestimated my ability. Even with all of my men added up, we wouldn&#x2019;t be a match for Toram&#x2026;&#x201D; Tamansi forced a smile.</p><p>He believed it necessary to clear things up with Leylin. Even if he was a royal and a special agent from the clan, he couldn&#x2019;t just sacrifice himself for him.</p><p>&#x201C;Your men?&#x201D; Leylin was rendered speechless. With such weak Magi and acolytes, they wouldn&#x2019;t even be able to break through the spell formation.</p><p>It was of no consequence, though. Tamansi was in charge of intelligence, he did not have high hopes regarding their fighting strength.</p><p>&#x201C;Just look after your men, I&#x2019;ll take care of the rest!&#x201D; he replied coldly before floating up.</p><p>Suddenly, a powerful and chilling surge of mountainous energy filled the entire place.</p><p>&#x201C;Th- Th- This!&#x201D; Tamansi stared hard at Leylin, eyes bulging. The energy he&#x2019;d felt from Leylin before was similar to his own, but he had suddenly burst forth like a ferocious creature.</p><p>The terrifying undulations of Leylin&#x2019;s energy rose endlessly. In the blink of an eye, it broke through rank 3 and skyrocketed to an unpredictable level.</p><p>&#x201C;My Lord, it seems like you&#x2019;re not one of those royals who only fool around, but instead a person with influence.&#x201D; Tamansi&#x2019;s eyes lit up. If he were to be affiliated to Leylin, he&#x2019;d have an unimaginable future and could even fulfil his dream of revitalizing his family.</p><p>&#x201C;Marquis! My Lord, you must be a Marquis that holds authority in the clan!&#x201D; Tamansi balled up his fists, his face flushed.</p><p>The moment Leylin stopped repressing his aura, he&#x2019;d actually felt a desire to kneel.</p><p>Tamansi had never felt such a sense of majesty from other Marquis similar to Leylin.</p><p>Leylin, on the other hand, did not care about how others felt about him.</p><p>Because he had given up suppressing his aura, he had been discovered by Tamansi. Presently, he was suddenly engulfed by a sudden fog that had appeared in the forest which evidently, was the work of Tamansi.</p><p>&#x201C;Which Magus is out there? We are a secret guild that rejects all visitors and transactions!&#x201D; A large quantity of light was emitted, forming a giant defence shield covered in flickering runes. By the looks of it, the Magus isn&#x2019;t someone to be trifled with. Additionally, with the decisive tone of the Magus, most people would have backed off if they had stumbled upon this Magus by accident.</p><p>Still, Leylin was not like most people. Besides, his mission here was to exterminate them.</p><p>&#x201C;Is it the Arm of Vengeance?&#x201D; Leylin towered over the spell formation, his voice piercing through. He had wanted to make a final confirmation in order to prevent any unwanted mishaps.</p><p>&#x201C;A Warlock from the Ouroboros Clan?!&quot; A probing light shone down, and the tone turned menacing. The pure hatred dripping in that voice had even Leylin shuddering.</p><p>Nevertheless, it gave Leylin the confirmation he needed. Things would now be a lot easier.</p><p>Leylin&#x2019;s pupils reflected his indifference. To him, the war for resources and benefits was never a question of right or wrong. It was the mere determination of a winner and a loser.</p><p>Meanwhile, at the top of a group of buildings inside the spell formation.</p><p>The face of the female Magus who had spoken earlier was distorted as she stared at a crimson crystal in her hand.</p><p>A female Magus who looked to be in her teens, cheeks still chubby, arrived at the side of her Mentor and asked, &#x201C;Mentor, what&#x2019;s wrong?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;It&#x2019;s the Ouroboros Clan. Those damned Warlocks have managed to track us here!&#x201D; The woman appeared to be in her thirties, with a voluptuous body. She would be a stunning beauty were it not for the huge cross-shaped scar across her face.</p><p>&#x201C;Ouroboros Clan?&#x201D; The youth inhaled sharply. That name brought about images of demons, of a monster dens and other terrifying creatures. To her, Warlocks from the Ouroboros Clan were menacing demons that could swallow someone whole in a matter of seconds.</p><p>&#x201C;I&#x2019;m afraid the situation is borderline threatening now that they&#x2019;ve managed to track this place down. When the inevitable arrives, you have to run off while I try my best to delay their path,&#x201D; the scar-faced Magus turned and ordered with a wistful expression.</p><p>&#x201C;You want me to run? What about Hulk and Fanny, what about the rest?&#x201D; The teen Magus was startled upon hearing those words from her mentor.</p><p>&#x201C;This is a life or death situation, we can&#x2019;t afford to care about them!&#x201D; The scar-faced Magus smiled bitterly as she watched the chaotic situation of the crowd below.</p><p>&#x201C;I can&#x2019;t believe they&#x2019;re here!&#x201D; A white-headed elder male Magus exclaimed as he floated up along with a few other Magi.</p><p>&#x201C;We&#x2019;ll go all out then! There&#x2019;s nothing to be afraid of!&#x201D; a muscular middle aged Magus said. He had an eye missing and his head was adorned with a tiger skull.</p><p>*Boom!* The spell formation trembled and the defensive shield started vibrated vigorously.</p><p>It was a sight akin to that of the heaven and earth cracking apart. It swept across the small encampment almost immediately, causing the faces of many Magi to darken.</p><p>&#x2026;&#x2026;</p><p>Outside the shield, Leylin was looking at the powerful defensive spell formation from a vantage point. &#x2018;The spiritual force of a Magus could also represent the limitations of their abilities&#x2026;&#x2019;</p><p>With a spell formation like this, given his previous level of strength, he would&#x2019;ve taken some time to completely demolish it.</p><p>&#x2018;If it&#x2019;s less than 20 degrees it would be at an acolyte&#x2019;s level. Rank 1 Magi if it&#x2019;s between 20 to 80 degrees, rank 2 if it&#x2019;s between 80 to 200 degrees and rank 3 if it&#x2019;s more than 200&#x2026;&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;But once the spell surpasses 300 degrees, even Crystal Phase Magi will have to be careful.&#x2019;</p><p>Leylin mumbled to himself and played around with the complicated spell model that was sent to his sea of consciousness by the A.I. Chip.</p><p>The many individual runes came together perfectly in this model and gave off an exquisite feel.</p><p>Leylin had practised the manipulation of this spell very well through his A.I. Chip previously. The way he was using it now was as if he&#x2019;s tried it umpteen times, and it was beyond just proficient.</p><p>*Boom!* Numerous elemental tides were formed, and due to the impressive strength of this spell, the darkness and fire elemental particles of this region were instantaneously sucked away, as if encountering an elemental black hole.</p><p>The energy exhaustion of a rank 3 spell was, of course, not something rank 1 or rank 2 spells could compared to. But the current situation was one that even Leylin felt uncomfortable in.</p><p>The terrifying energy did not in the least dissipate but instead agglomerated in Leylin&#x2019;s palm, forming black rays.</p><p>The space caved in and was seemingly absorbed by the black rays.</p><p>&#x201C;Fatality&#x2019;s Tip!&#x201D; Leylin flicked his finger, and a black ray met the defensive spell formation with a loud bang.</p><p>[Fatality&#x2019;s Tip: Rank 3 Spell. Elements: Darkness and Fire. Concentrates all energy into one piercing point. Side effects: Corrosion and Burns. Power: 330 - 360 degrees!]</p><p>Leylin had named this spell himself. By giving up on area of effect and condensing all of his power into one finger, it could grant death to any creature below the Morning Star realm, hence the name.</p><p>Of course, there was a tinge of self-mockery at the fragility of his previous life.</p><p>*Pop!* Just like a soap bubble that was pricked, the powerful defence shield fell short in the face of the deadly attack, and lost all of its strength before instantly shattering apart.</p><p>The fog faded, revealing the buildings behind and the Magi whose faces were drained of colour.</p><p>&#x201C;Toram?!&#x201D; Leylin&#x2019;s looked at his target. The scar on her face left an exceptional impression.</p><p>Her scar was left behind during the massacre, and as a woman she could obviously remove the scar for vanity&#x2019;s sake. But for the memory of her hatred, she had kept it on her face as a reminder.</p><p>More often than not, people like these were extremely heartless and were people whom Leylin had to pay more attention to.</p><p>&#x201C;Only one? A rank 3 Hydro Phase Kemoyin Warlock? &#x201D; Seeing Leylin coming to them alone, Toram&#x2019;s expression differed from those of her happy peers. She turned even more gloomy, and gave off a sense of hopelessness.</p><p>In the Magus world, someone who dared to move alone was a lot stronger than a collective.</p><p>And if Leylin dared to arrive singlehandedly, he must have had the utmost confidence in killing them all right here</p><p>&#x201C;This is life or death, we don&#x2019;t have to hold back any longer. Ensuring the escape of our seeds is the highest priority!&#x201D; Toram commanded.</p><p>&#x201C;Of course, I&#x2019;ve been wanting to take the lives of Kemoyin Warlocks since long ago. I&#x2019;ll skin him alive and use him as a carpet!&#x201D; The tiger-skull Magus remarked with hate, shooting a dirty glance at Leylin.</p><p>&#x2018;Other than Toram who is a Hydro Phase, there are still two other rank 3 Magi?&#x2019; Leylin&#x2019;s eyes glistened as the A.I. Chip began collecting the data on his enemies and predicting the possible outcomes.</p><p>As for those acolytes? They were like specks of dust to him.</p><p>&#x201C;Since you&#x2019;re a Kemoyin Warlock, if you lose your life here, I&#x2019;m sure those higher-ups would mourn this loss!&#x201D; Toram&#x2019;s eyes turned bloodshot, and she covered herself in a liquid-like armour.</p><p>&#x201C;Similarly, after all of you perish, the Arm of Vengeance won&#x2019;t be any trouble for a period of time!&#x201D; Leylin retorted.</p><p>&#x201C;But before I finish you, I should do some clean-up!&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Clean-up? Oh no! He is planning to&#x2014;&#x201D; Toram&#x2019;s expression fell instantly but it was too late.</p><p>A horrifying projection of the Giant Kemoyin Serpent emerged behind Leylin, &#x201C;Toxic Bile!&#x201D;</p><p>With the maturation of his bloodline, this innate spell of his had also grown exponentially, and it had even exceeded 200 degrees of power, reaching the strength of a rank 3 spell. Even with preventive measures, it would be difficult for the rank 1 and rank 2 Magi to survive it.</p><p>On top of that, the effect of the spell would be even more amplified now that the defensive shield was down.</p><p></p><hr><p></p>
