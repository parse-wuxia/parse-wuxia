<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>The Completion of the Onyx Castle</strong></span></p><p>Leylin immediately commanded the A.I. Chip again.</p><p>[Task established! Initiating simulation, preparing main stats...] The A.I. Chip rapidly operated, and projected a 3D hologram in front of Leylin, which faintly resembled himself.</p><p>Apart from gathering and analysing large amounts of data, it could also run breakthrough simulations and obtain concrete probabilities and numbers. This was what made Leylin different from other Magi, who could only make deductions based on rough estimates of probabilities and slipshod experiments, or even through luck! And this was one of the reasons for Leylin&#x2019;s successful breakthroughs every time.</p><p>[Beep! Simulation completed! Conditions for breakthrough: sufficient spiritual force, the bloodline essence of the Corrosive Lizard, three portions of Purple Leaf Snake scaled-fruit, and a complete Vapour Phase spell formation! Success rate: 86.9%!]</p><p>The A.I chip presented this to Leylin.</p><p>&#x201C;A close to 90% chance of success is enough!&#x201D; Leylin clenched his fist tightly.</p><p>As they did not have the precise calculations of the A.I Chip, other Magi could only gather some materials that would help in the breakthrough. One would already thank the heavens if they had more than a 50% chance of success, let alone such an accurate forecast.</p><p>Leylin felt that after the A.I. Chip had fused with his soul, it had improved with his own progress, and its strengths had been amplified largely. Its predictive ability now greatly surpassed even the best A.I. Chips of his previous world.</p><p>In other words, his current A.I. Chip, even if placed in his previous world, would be too sophisticated to be copied.</p><p>&#x201D;The Purple Leaf Snake Scaled-fruit and the bloodline essence of the Corrosive lizard are the most commonly used supplementary materials when Warlocks attempt to make their breakthroughs, and can be found in the trading hall. Even though they are pricy, I can still afford it!&#x201D;</p><p>Having saved up money as a Potions Grandmaster for three years, and with the huge loan from Robin, Leylin could be said to have ample funds.</p><p>&#x2018;After this, I&#x2019;ll have to return to my territory to make the breakthrough, as well as to take charge of the construction of the Magus Tower!&#x2019; Leylin thought to himself.</p><p>A Magus Tower was being constructed next to Onyx Castle. This tower could be said to be his actual foothold in the central continent, and even as he was Potioneering for the majority of the past three years, he had not once loosened his watch on the construction of the Magus Tower.</p><p>Furthermore, the basic structure was already complete. The remaining portions, such as the installation of the elemental pools, adjustment of the spell formations and the like would have to be done by himself. The other Warlocks could only assist, after all, Leylin would not give anyone access to the secrets of the core of his tower.</p><p>&#x2018;The ability of a rank 3 Vapour Phase allows the activation of rank 4 spell scrolls. Then, we can even purchase a Scroll of Life from Mentor, that can be used to construct the entire intellectual core of the Magus Tower. Hopefully Mentor&#x2019;s price won&#x2019;t be too hefty&#x2026;&#x2019; Leylin thought casually, while looking for the data from the screens to carry out his transactions.</p><p>Even though he seemed preoccupied, under the tremendous assistance of the A.I chip, all the resources chosen were top-notch, and even the Vapour Phase spell formation was successfully obtained.</p><p>However, during the transaction, he had also obtained some news that made him frown.</p><p>&#x201D;Miranda and Freya returned after completing their task? But they were seriously injured? Why is that so?&#x201D; Leylin asked. These two were rank 3 Hydro Phase Warlocks. With the addition of their bloodline, their strengths were a few levels higher. That they would be seriously wounded had piqued his curiosity.</p><p>&#x201D;Sorry! This is a secret! Even I am unable to get any news!&#x201D; The peddler who had transacted with Leylin was a skinny Magus with a huge grin on his face. He did not dare offend Leylin; after all, Leylin was a big customer, and he had previously earned a huge sum from a previous transaction involving potions of tranquility.</p><p>The Magus came closer and lowered his voice, &#x201D;However, reports say that a mysterious person attacked them when they were exploring some ruins! This left the second elder furious, and he swore to find the culprit&#x2026;&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201D;So it&#x2019;s like that!&#x201D; Leylin nodded, and quickly completed the transaction.</p><p>He had to return to his territory as soon as possible to make the breakthrough. He&#x2019;d merely asked out of curiosity; no matter how chaotic it was here, it would not affect him.</p><p>&#x2026;&#x2026;</p><p>Onyx Castle.</p><p>Construction had been completed in the last three years. The entire structure was built out of sturdy granite, and was reinforced by earth-elemental spells that closed up the gaps between the underlying rocks. From the outside, the entirety of Onyx Castle looked grand and expansive, exuding a feeling of deterrence. This was the core of Leylin&#x2019;s territory.</p><p>With the amount of reinforcement it had gotten, Onyx Castle could last a few thousand years at the least. After seeing it, Alesandor remarked that he could hold the fort against fifty thousand elites with just a few thousand man, but of course this only applied to regular humans.</p><p>The castle was carpeted in cashmere. Silver cups and golden lampstands were everywhere. The place was filled with a flowing light, and its luxury was something few royal palaces could rival.</p><p>If a commoner were to use the castle, it might have stirred up criticism and attacks from other jealous leaders. But since the lord of the castle was a strong Magus, there would be no problem.</p><p>The strength Leylin possessed was enough to let anyone with negative intentions despair. The people would only compliment the nobility of its lord, and not for a moment have any designs on it.</p><p>&#x201D;Looks like Royce and Alesandor have taken care of this place fairly well!&#x201D; Leylin slowly walked into the castle.</p><p>He looked at the castle&#x2019;s surrounding farmland. A lot of it was already being cultivated, and large windmills were turning slowly as farmers cleared the earth of weeds.</p><p>These were slaves he had previously purchased, with a portion of them being leaders.</p><p>In the process of the construction of the castle, a portion of the outstanding slaves and citizens had received rewards in the form of land. Since then, they had settled down and built a relatively prosperous area.</p><p>Soldiers and tall knights patrolled the place from time to time.</p><p>Royce and Alesandor who were appointed and nominated to oversee politics and military matters respectively had exhausted their time and effort into building a foundation over here due to the temptation of status and territory. At least in Leylin&#x2019;s eyes, the Onyx Castle looked more or less like a Marquis&#x2019; palace.</p><p>&#x201D;Welcome home, my Lord!&#x201D; Once they neared the main gate, Kubler quickly hurried out. He was wearing a butler uniform and looked very energetic, with Royce and Alesandor following behind him.</p><p>&#x201D;Mmm! Well done!&#x201D; Leylin nodded his head slightly, and acknowledged Kubler&#x2019;s work. He was not one to leave the power in the hands of only two people, and hence he&#x2019;d left Kubler here as well.</p><p>Even though he could be sure that Royce and Alesandor would not dare to betray him, corruption was inevitable. However, with Kubler around, Royce and Alesandor would not dare to cross the line.</p><p>&#x201D;Master! The latest survey has been completed. Within your territory, there are a total of 13,572 soldiers. The total population is.&#x2026;&#x201D;</p><p>Before Kubler could finish his sentence, Leylin waved his hand and interrupted him. &#x201D;Write a report about that stuff and hand it over to me later. For now, follow me. I want to look at the progress on the Magus Tower!&#x201D;</p><p>Leylin had invested in the Magus Tower more than ten thousand times what he had invested into Onyx Castle! He would naturally devote minimal attention to it, instead electing to let the A.I. Chip scan progress reports every now and then.</p><p>&#x201D;As you wish, Master!&#x201D; Kubler followed Leylin in his rightful position. Meanwhile, Royce and Alesandor exchanged glances and could only smile grimly.</p><p>A small distance from Onyx Castle, atop a mountain, was a huge piece of construction land with various workers running about.</p><p>Because they were building a Magus Tower, they could no longer use ordinary human slaves. Ordinary humans were useless when it came to certain special construction materials, not to mention the possible contamination caused by long-term contact with such materials. Even with a purification tower, ordinary human slaves would perish within a short period of time!</p><p>&#x201D;Hurry! Quicken your pace! Or else there won&#x2019;t be any alloy rods for dinner tonight!&#x201D; A youthful Warlock with an iron whip in his hands was shouting in a strange language.</p><p>Warlock acolytes, and even some formal Warlocks, were doubling up as foremen and architects in the construction site, rushing a few strange slaves to speed up their work.</p><p>These slaves were large in stature, with hard skin the colour of stone.</p><p>These slaves were from the Stone tribe. Leylin had previously deciphered a book written in the Turin language from the pocket dimension of the Ancient Spirit Slaying Sect. In it there was content left behind by the craftsmen of the Stone tribe.</p><p>The Stone tribe was a type of human race. Because of their naturally large stature in addition to their stony exteriors that were as powerful as defensive spells, they could be said to have tough bodies. They were the species ancient Magi favoured to be construction slaves. Much of the construction in the Ancient Spirit Slaying Sect was done by them.</p><p>The members of the Stone tribe spoke in the Turin language, mentioned by the young Warlock, which was a difficult one to learn. Still, for Magi, it was no big deal.</p><p>The Stone tribe existed in Twilight Zone and the south coast, but Leylin had not expected them to be present here as well, let alone being sold as high-class slaves!</p><p>For the construction of the tower, Leylin could only grit his teeth and buy a large batch of these slaves. It cost him no small amount!</p><p>Leylin&#x2019;s arrival naturally attracted the attention of some Magi. Not long after, an extremely good-looking and youthful Magus came before Leylin and bowed respectfully, &#x201D;Master!&#x201D;</p><p>What was shocking was that his voice sounded extremely aged, which was not consistent with his appearance.</p><p>&#x201D;Rise, Parker! What&#x2019;s the progress on the construction of the tower?&#x201D;</p><p></p><hr><p></p>
