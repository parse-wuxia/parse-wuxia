<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>Killing the Clone </strong></span></p><p>&#x201C;So you&#x2019;re relying on this?&#x201D; the Azure Mountain King laughed coldly, &#x201C;Do you think you can control this hurricane? It may be possible if I came with my main body&#x2026;&#x201D;</p><p>Nonetheless, his face was full of fear, and he unconsciously took a few steps back.</p><p>&#x201C;If you don&#x2019;t try, how would you know?&#x201D; Leylin chuckled, and suddenly rubbed the ring on his hand. A strange energy wave seemed to pass by at the speed of light.</p><p>Miles away, Parker looked at the communicator in his hands with a stern expression. He then ordered, &#x201C;Activate!&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Beginning operation! Preparing number 1 energy reactor!&#x201D; Snoopy shouted immediately.</p><p>&#x201C;The elemental particle gathering device is complete, beginning ground vibration!&#x201D;</p><p>Many Warlocks, as hardworking as ants, began to get busy, and one by one, strange symbols were lit up on the surface of the huge pyramidal reactor.</p><p>*Rumble!* At this moment, the surface of the ground seemed to come alive as a large amount of energy was bound and transmitted towards Leylin&#x2019;s direction.</p><p>This violent earthquake did not cause much trouble for the warlocks, as expected. Snoopy wiped away the cold sweat on his forehead and went to his grandfather&#x2019;s side with an evident look of worry on his face, &#x201C;Grandfather, will Mentor be able to succeed? I&#x2019;ve never heard of this idea before&#x2026; No! I wouldn&#x2019;t be able to think of this even in my dreams! Once any node goes wrong, I&#x2019;m afraid what awaits Mentor will be&#x2026;&#x201D;</p><p>Before he could finish speaking, a thick, muscular palm pressed down on his shoulders, &#x201C;Snoopy! You have to believe in your mentor!&#x201D;</p><p>Parker&#x2019;s eyes did not mask his respect for Leylin, &#x201C;He is the most profound scholar and the strictest Magus amongst everyone I&#x2019;ve met! Once the lord makes a decision, it will definitely be correct, we only need to follow and execute according to the plan devised by the lord!&#x201D;</p><p>After interacting with them for more than a century, be it in force or knowledge, Leylin had long ago subdued these men of his.</p><p>&#x201C;Yes!&#x201D; Snoopy nodded repeatedly, and his previous worries disappeared immediately.</p><p>At another place, Tanasha was also doing the same thing.</p><p>A perfectly straight lightning rod, almost piercing through the horizon, stood firmly on a pile of black rocks.</p><p>Thunder roared and lightning flashed. Many blue electric waves growled and rushed towards the black needle, before diverging in all directions through the path that was laid out.</p><p>&#x201C;Sir! I Hope you will succeed!&#x201D; Tanasha grew a little excited in her heart, praying silently.</p><p>&#x2026;...</p><p>&#x201C;Preparations for node 1 completed, review of node 2 completed, preparing to charge node 3&#x2026;&#x201D;</p><p>Data kept pouring out from the A.I. Chip continuously and many fluorescent-blue information windows flashed past Leylin&#x2019;s eyes.</p><p>*Rumble!* The howling hurricane that was brewing in the sky seemed to be controlled by someone, and it slowly began to transform and pack together, converging behind Leylin.</p><p>The windstorm roared, dissipating the dark gas and silently turning the rocks and plants on the roadside to dust. It then wrapped the Azure Mountain King within.</p><p>&#x201C;How&#x2026; How is this possible? Why can you&#x2026;&#x2026;&#x201D; The Azure Mountain King&#x2019;s eyes almost popped out.</p><p>How could a mere rank 3 Crystal Phase Magus possess such enormous power?</p><p>After he came here, he had definitely tested with his soul force that there were no other Magi lying in ambush. There were also no signs of any spell formation!</p><p>&#x201C;I am unable to hide anything from soul force scans, hence I did not plan anything here&#x2026;&#x201D; Leylin stood above the hurricane, as if he was a deity from another world.</p><p>&#x201C;Thus, the closest spell formation that I&#x2019;ve set up is 45 kilometers away. The underground hurricane is being manipulated through redistribution points and could be temporarily kept under control! I call this spell formation&#x2014;farcast support spell formation!&#x201D;</p><p>Using the superimposition of small influences from other areas, he ultimately gained control over the hurricane!</p><p>It was easier said than done. To do it, the calculations needed were terrifyingly complex, fit to be described as perverse.</p><p>Even if there was a slight error the data, there was a possibility that the hurricane would ultimately lose all control. As the one to bear the brunt of the damage, Leylin would be the first to die without any remains.</p><p>Such horrifying calculations, even the Azure Mountain King felt giddy from just simulating them in his head.</p><p>Leylin had done something even Morning Star Magi could not thanks to his A.I. Chip, a scientific chip from his previous world which possessed incredible abilities after numerous extreme transformation and advancements!</p><p>&#x201C;The hurricane can destroy anything under rank 4, you are destined to die today!&#x201D; Leylin&#x2019;s expression was calm, his face showing no signs of sadness or happiness.</p><p>But the hurricane, which was under his control, suddenly screeched. A large gust of strong black wind surrounded the Azure Mountain King and began to spin around him, as if it wanted to drag him into the eye of the hurricane.</p><p>&#x201C;No! I have not fallen yet!&#x201D; The Azure Mountain King&#x2019;s eyes flushed red, and his facial muscles twitched as he suddenly growled.</p><p>Explosions rang out as the crystal clear soul force transformed into a defensive film on his body. Terrifying accessories, which had reached the level of magic artifacts, began to explode one by one.</p><p>The massive explosion caused a horrifying driving force, and even the hurricane was momentarily blocked out.</p><p>Using this hard-earned chance, the Azure Mountain King immediately dashed out to break through the barrier.</p><p>&#x201C;You can&#x2019;t escape!&#x201D; The large Multi-Armed Race phantom thrashed and growled behind Leylin. The hurricane gathered in Leylin&#x2019;s hands as he stood before the Azure Mountain King and threw out a sudden punch.</p><p>*Boom!* Like the roar of an ancient giant snake, along with the accompanying howls of the many hurricanes, a terrifying energy instantly extinguished the explosion from before, breaking through the Azure Mountain King&#x2019;s body.</p><p>Even if it was soul power, under the the besiegement of the hurricane, it was exhausted too quickly. The protective film immediately crackled and broke.</p><p>Cracks began appearing one after another, and due to Leylin&#x2019;s attack, the Azure Mountain King was once again pushed back into the eye of the hurricane.</p><p>While watching Leylin, who stood outside like a war god, a hint of despair surfaced on the Azure Mountain King&#x2019;s face&#x2026;</p><p>*Rumble!* It was as if the world exploded, reaching its end.</p><p>Among the many dark storms, a touch of blue light suddenly exploded. It immediately intensified, offsetting the dark storms persistently.</p><p>The terrifying energy waves dissipated as streaks of silver cracks in the space emerged endlessly.</p><p>The dark storms howled, but it also seemed to weaken under the blue radiance as time passed. At the same time, the blue radiance slowly began to dim.</p><p>The earth rumbled, and after what seemed like a sky-shaking and violent magnitude 9 earthquake, everything finally calmed down. Only, the surroundings had already been destroyed beyond recognition.</p><p>Even a part of the West Sea Canyon was totally wiped out, becoming a large, ruinous rocky plain.</p><p>&#x201C;Master!&#x201D;</p><p>This was the scene that Tanasha and Parker, who had rushed over, saw. Their faces seemed to search for answers anxiously, until they saw Leylin who was standing on a large rock proudly. Their faces were immediately overcome with delight.</p><p>&#x201C;Yes!&#x201D; Leylin nodded.</p><p>Currently, he was in a very bad condition. Not only were there blue wounds all over his body that were bubbling and corroding it, there was also an obvious dent on his chest.</p><p>In his hands, there was an already prepared crystalised test tube, in which laid a piece of burnt flesh. Surrounding it were some squirming tentacles.</p><p>&#x201C;I&#x2019;m fine!&#x201D; Leylin waved, stopping Tanasha and Parker&#x2019;s greetings.</p><p>&#x201C;I give you all an hour&#x2019;s time, search this area immediately and look for bloody pieces of flesh like this! No matter what the outcome is an hour later, we will leave immediately!&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Yes, Sir!&#x201D;</p><p>Watching his men busy themselves, a bitter smile emerged on Leylin&#x2019;s face.</p><p>The Azure Mountain King was indeed a Morning Star Magus, with an extremely determined mind. After he realised that there was no hope of escaping, he immediately cast some sort of secret spell, detonating his clone.</p><p>The self-destruction of a rank 3 Magus&#x2019; clone would cause major damage.</p><p>Not only was Leylin&#x2019;s spell formation utterly defeated, he himself had sustained serious injuries. This could be said to be a loss for both parties.</p><p>&#x2018;But as long as these things can be obtained, it&#x2019;ll be worth it,&#x2019; Leylin put away the pieces of flesh safely, before his heart lightened.</p><p>Although the Azure Mountain King had self-destructed, losing him the opportunity to collect his complete body, the tissue structures of these bloody pieces of flesh and such were enough for the A.I. Chip to study for a long time.</p><p>And after obtaining these, the A.I. Chip&#x2019;s deductions on the Morning Star Realm would be able to advance to at least 50% and above!</p><p>&#x201C;If it&#x2019;s like that, the conditions are more or less all set! We only need to prepare for the Azure Mountain King&#x2019;s counterattack!&#x201D; Leylin stroked his chin.</p><p>Originally, he and the Oakheart Clan were prepared to give their lives to achieve their goals. Now, the other party&#x2019;s Morning Star Magus had lost his clone at his hands. Surely the Azure Mountain King would be going crazy.</p><p>&#x2018;We cannot stay in this territory anymore, we must hurry back to the organisation and evacuate as soon as possible&#x2026;&#x2019; Leylin was stuck in thought.</p><p>Although it still seemed peaceful at his Onyx Castle in the core of the Ouroboros Clan, with Robin&#x2019;s Parble Family reduced to their sorry state, was it really?</p><p>Perhaps, as of now, only the area at the headquarters of the Phosphorescence Swamp could forcibly maintain stability.</p><p>Although they lacked Morning Star battle power, under circumstances where outsiders were still unsure, keeping it a secret for a period of time was no problem at all.</p><p>Furthermore, based on the Ouroboros Clan&#x2019;s arduous accumulation as well as the spell formations, defence installations and such by the Morning Star Warlocks ancestors, hindering a certain Morning Star Magus for a duration was still not an issue.</p><p>What Leylin needed most right now, was time!</p><p>This was because the headquarters of the Ouroboros Clan was definitely a point of attack for many enemies in the future. Once it was confirmed that the battle powers of the Morning Star were gone, there was a high chance that they might face a siege from numerous Morning Star Magi.</p><p>By that time, the headquarters would be a deathtrap!</p><p>If they lost the other territories, without advancing to the Morning Star level before the Phosphorescence Swamp was attacked, all of the Warlocks at the headquarters could only accept death!</p><p></p><hr><p></p>
