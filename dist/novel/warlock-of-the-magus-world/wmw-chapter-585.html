It was a huge public square located in the Morning Star Magus Tower, created with the help of the tower genie. On the ground were complex designs and magic runes, and even vicious totem images.</p><p>Surrounding the entire spell formation were four gigantic pillars, every single stone pillar the thickness of three men combined. Above them was something like a huge hollow tunnel, it seemed to be split open by sharp weapons, full of a wild ancient aura.</p><p>[Hades&#x2019; Blood Sacrifice spell formation, progress 99.9999%] the A. I. Chip responded after scanning through.</p><p>&#x201C;Hades&#x2019; spell formation, what an affinity between us!&#x201D; Leylin laughed.</p><p>Hades was one of the most terrifying dark Magi of ancient myth. His level of dark magic was said to be unreachable, and rumour had it that he had even completely grasped the rules of death. He possessed eternal youth, and was full of desire for flesh and souls.</p><p>But of course, Hades was nothing more than a super powerful dark Magus in the eyes of Leylin and other Magi, and some even looked up to Hades as a motivational target and tried to surpass him.</p><p>When Leylin was trying to advance to rank 2, he had made use of the opponent&apos;s spell formation to harvest spirits.</p><p>Of course, the current blood spell formation was a few levels higher than the one back then, it could even absorb the sacrificial offerings&#x2019; bloodlines by force in order to increase the Morning Star Magus&#x2019;s vitality.</p><p>Leylin took a look at his current status:</p><p>[Leylin Farlier, Rank 4 Bloodline Warlock: Giant Kemoyin Serpent (complete form) Strength: 50, Agility: 45, Vitality: 65, Spiritual Force: 956.8, Magic Power: 956 (magic power in synchronisation with spiritual force) Soul Force: ???]</p><p>&#x201C;I have more than enough spiritual force, but vitality is so hard to increase!&#x201D; Leylin smiled wryly. This was the side effect for his sudden, huge advancements recently.</p><p>Moreover, if his vitality still could not reach 100, it would be a huge problem once the Multilimb seal was broken.</p><p>&#x201C;Begin!&#x201D; Leylin&#x2019;s eyes shimmered with crimson light.</p><p>*Crack! Crack!* Under the manipulation of the tower genie, the entire square started shaking, and grieved howls could be heard from a near distance.</p><p>That was the mourning of the strengthened Kobold Warlocks. After the bloodline extraction, these creatures were being treated as waste material and processed by Leylin</p><p>Waves of a terrifying aura rose continuously within the spell formation. Once the mourning of the Kobolds weakened, the whole spell formation started to change.</p><p>The four gigantic stone pillars surrounding the square began to shake. From the tunnel up above, a huge amount of sticky liquid that was blood red in colour dripped down. Mixed in were white objects that looked like crushed bones.</p><p>The red liquid first filled the pillars to the brink, before it slowly spilled out like blood flowing in veins, causing the pillars to turn crimson.</p><p>The liquid flowed all the way down, finally reaching the runes of the spell formation.</p><p>The concentrated blood red liquid filled the runes in order. The entire process was full of a certain solemnity, and the stagnant atmosphere was stifling.</p><p>The spell formation kicked into action, and an enormous layer of crimson light shot up from the runes.</p><p>Under the attraction of the crimson light rays, the vacant void above the spell formation was broken. Light took on the form of symbols seen in sacrificial rites, as it began to radiate waves of summoning.</p><p>*Awooooo&#x2026;*The phantom of a monstrous two-headed wolf hovered in the sky above the spell formation, howling ferociously. Greed filled its green eyes as saliva dripped down its jaws.</p><p>&#x2018;I&#x2019;ve never seen such a summoning technique before, is it a summoning from a foreign world or from a different time and space?&#x2019; Leylin&#x2018;s eyes flashed blue. He had ordered the A.I. Chip to record the scene down into his database for future use.</p><p>*Awooooo&#x2026;* The two-headed wolf did not start to feast on the pulp of flesh, bones and blood immediately. Instead, it turned to Leylin, a ferocious look in its eyes as it glared at him as if he was one of the offerings.</p><p>&#x2018;It has a certain level of intelligence? Could it be a clone of Hades?&#x2019; Leylin stroked his chin, started as he sized up this two-headed wolf. This carefree behaviour of Leylin greatly irritated the phantom as it howled and aimed to pounce onto Leylin.</p><p>*Sssssii* A malevolent phantom of the Giant Kemoyin Serpent, this one with crimson scales, appeared behind Leylin and bared its jaws at the wolf.</p><p>A magnificent aura emanated from the Kemoyin Serpent, causing the wolf to waver.</p><p>&#x201C;The summoning of a creature from another world is indeed troublesome!&#x201D; Leylin snorted, started to activate a spell.</p><p>*Rumble!* Eye piercing white flashes of lightning struck the phantom, causing it to howl as it lost some of its dark form.</p><p>After the lightning passed, each of the two wolf heads now had a collar on, with spikes that faced the neck.</p><p>The two-headed wolf was threatened by the spikes, and dared not rebel. It then dashed into the crimson light before starting to feast on the flesh hungrily. The formation grew silent except for the bone-chilling munching noises.</p><p>After a few minutes, the flesh and light inside the spell formation were both devoured by the two-headed wolf. It then roared to the sky, the sound waves travelling far and wide as it howled loudly.</p><p>The spell formation started to warp once more under these terrifying howls.</p><p>Starlight shone down through the Magus Tower, revealing the image of a bright moon.</p><p>Under the howls of the wolf, the moon gradually turned red before it stretched into the sides and formed the shape of a human eye.</p><p>An icy gaze swept across, causing Leylin to shudder in fear. He felt as if he had called upon a disaster and his body tensed up. &#x2018;This pressuring aura must surely belong to a high levelled Magus!&#x2019;</p><p>Leylin inhaled deeply. Fortunately, the crimson eye did not fix its gaze on him. Instead, it only spared him a short glance and focused on the two-headed wolf.</p><p>An eerie scene formed as the two-headed wolf howled continuously under the gaze of the crimson moon-eye.</p><p>*Pop!* The sound of a bubble bursting was followed by a crisp explosive sound, and the phenomenal sights in the area disappeared without a trace.</p><p>The two-headed wolf, the full moon and the starlight suddenly seemed to be an illusion, and a tinge of purple light twirled around the spell formation.</p><p>[Conscient of greed from a foreign world has been attracted, summoning of ancient Hades phantom is complete!] A notification from the A. I. Chip sounded, reminding Leylin that what he had seen just now was not a hallucination.</p><p>&#x201C;Phew...what a weird spell formation! Hades, the king of the ancient dark Magi, is truly a powerful elite!&#x201D; Leylin let out a long breath and stepped into the spell formation.</p><p>*Boom* The rumbling of the formation acted like a signal, and a huge amount of purple light converged on Leylin as it entered his body.</p><p>&#x201C;Argh!&#x201D; Leylin let out a stuffy groan and started to spasm.</p><p>After the purple light rays entered his body, they started wriggling like earthworms. This feeling was indescribable; if not for his superb vitality and great endurance, he would have passed out or even died due to the pain!</p><p>&#x201C;The Giant Dragon Potion!&#x201D; Leylin kept himself composed, using the purplish red medicine which he had long since prepared in his hand.</p><p>*Pow!* There seemed to be a chemical reaction when the potion entered his stomach, and the amount of pain increased tenfold.</p><p>Leylin&#x2019;s vision turned pitch black, but he managed to persevere through it with his strong will.</p><p>[Beep! Host is undergoing Hades&#x2019; sacrificial rites! Muscle fiber strengthening in process.]</p><p>[Beep! Host is absorbing quintessential materials, vitality increased.]</p><p>[Beep! Giant Dragon Potion has taken effect. Radiation is creating the best environment for absorption.] The notifications from the A. I. Chip sounded continuously.</p><p>After the last wave of pain had passed, Leylin felt a stream of boiling heat gushing all over his body.</p><p>[Beep! Host vitality increasing, currently at 66.7! 67.5! 68.3! 69.9!]</p><p>The value showing Leylin&#x2019;s vitality kept on increasing in the A. I. Chip&#x2019;s database, and surpassed 70 within a split second before continuing on.</p><p>71! 72! 73! 74! 74.5!</p><p>In almost an instant, the number had rocketed up by ten. It only stopped upon reaching 74.9.</p><p>Leylin straightened his body after the effects of the potion passed, and crackling sounds rang throughout it.</p><p>[Host data changed, readjusting!]</p><p>Leylin took a look at his stats and discovered a huge change in them.</p><p>[Leylin Farlier, Rank 4 Bloodline Warlock: Kemoyin&#x2019;s Serpent (complete form) Strength: 50 Agility: 45 Vitality: 74.9 Spiritual Force: 956.8 Magic Power: 956(Magic power in synchronisation with spiritual force) Soul force:???]</p><p>&#x201C;Hmm! Vitality had increased by 9.9 units! Pretty close to the estimated data from the A. I. Chip!&#x201D; Leylin nodded in satisfaction.</p><p>Right now, he had reached a monstrous value in terms of his vitality.</p><p></p><hr><p></p>
