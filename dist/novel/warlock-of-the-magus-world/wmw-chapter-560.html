<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>Meeting</strong></span></p><p>&#x201C;It&#x2019;s not for us to decide anyway, since they&#x2019;ve already taken the initiative to come here!&#x201D;</p><p>Crimson flames flashed on Emma&#x2019;s body as she appeared in mid-air, Gilbert right behind her. Eventually, the two came to a stop, standing side by side.</p><p>&#x201C;The soul flames are closing in very quickly, and the other party&#x2019;s aura is very powerful! It&#x2019;s a Morning Star, but&#x2026; This blood line undulation&#x2026; How is it possible&#x2026;&#x201D; Gilbert turned to Emma in disbelief, only to be met with Emma&#x2019;s eyes filled with similar astonishment and suspicion.</p><p>From the incoming person, they felt the purest Kemoyin bloodline aura. But how was that possible?</p><p>There had always only been three Morning Star Warlocks in the Ouroboros Clan.</p><p>&#x2018;Did the First Elder come back to life?&#x2019; An idea rose in Gilbert&#x2019;s mind, but was quickly extinguished. He had personally seen the death of the First Elder, and his point mass had even returned to the astral plane.</p><p>From the thickness of the bloodline, the purity of the other party&#x2019;s Kemoyin bloodline was even above that of themselves, even that of the First Elder!</p><p>&#x201C;Who is it?&#x201D; Gilbert and Emma watched the red rays that were shooting over from the distance, filled with curiosity.</p><p>*Sou!* The light rays dissipated, revealing the appearance of a handsome young man.</p><p>A bright smile on his face, and he rushed to bow towards Gilbert. &#x201C;Mentor&#x2026; I&#x2019;ve arrived!&#x201D;</p><p>In the next moment, Gilbert and Emma&#x2019;s mouths were just as wide, their eyeballs almost popping out. &#x201C;Leylin? How&#x2019;s that possible?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x2026;&#x2026;</p><p>A good while later, while Gilbert and Emma seemed to have accepted Leylin&#x2019;s promotion to Morning Star as reality, there was still a shock that could not be concealed in their eyes.</p><p>&#x201C;... This is how it happened. I advanced to Morning Star just when Phosphorescence Swamp was about to be breached, and then killed Demon Hunter Cyril. The allied forces withdrew, and both sides are restraining themselves. The situation has now stabilised&#x2026;&#x201D;</p><p>Leylin gave a brief overview of what he had experienced in the Magus World. Of course, anything that touched upon his secrets, such as the A.I. Chip, the Lamia fingerbone and all that, was obviously hidden and not discussed. Gilbert and Emma had not asked either.</p><p>Of those who had reached the realm of Morning Star, who did not have their own secrets? Even the two of them had many fortuitous meetings while at rank 3, and received inheritances from ruins and the like, which had allowed them to thankfully advance to rank 4.</p><p>&#x201C;In that case&#x2026; That guy, Cyril, is really dead&#x2026;&#x201D; Emma&#x2019;s eyes were filled with astonishment as she sized up Leylin. Compared to her own age, Leylin was much too young right now.</p><p>However, it was this adolescent Warlock who had caused Demon Hunter Cyril&#x2019;s fall?</p><p>Emma couldn&#x2019;t help but recall Cyril&#x2019;s terrifying demonic spells, as well as his power and abundant experience. Her opinion of this young man raised immensely.</p><p>&#x201C;Alright! Well then&#x2026; Are the two of you willing to return to the Magus World now?&#x201D; Leylin took off the silver-white necklace on his neck that was emanating the rays of stars. Gilbert and Emma&#x2019;s breaths immediately became heavier.</p><p>This was the projection of the coordinates of Leylin&#x2019;s astral gate. It could open the astral gate and allow them to return to the Ouroboros Clan.</p><p>However, Gilbert and Emma exchanged a wry smile, and did not speak. Instead, the area turned strangely silent.</p><p>&#x201C;I understand. It seems like Your Graces still have very important things to do in the Lava World!&#x201D; Leylin laughed, not minding the least.</p><p>&#x201C;Yes!&#x201D; In the end, it was Emma who spoke up. &#x201C;Leylin, you&#x2019;re a Morning Star just like us, so you don&#x2019;t have to call us &#x2018;Your Grace&#x2019;. Just call us by our names&#x2026;&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Alright, my Lords!&#x201D; Leylin looked solemn as he began to make guesses. &#x201C;Is it because of the firasource stones?&#x201D;</p><p>The moment the words left his mouth, Leylin noticed the change in Gilbert&#x2019;s expression, while Emma cried out in alarm.</p><p>&#x201C;You&#x2019;ve actually found out!&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Of course! It&#x2019;s a treasure that can strengthen the soul and even the point mass. Any Morning Star would go crazy over it!&#x201D; Leylin nodded as he admitted.</p><p>&#x201C;Alright. In that case, we don&#x2019;t have to keep hiding it from you like before.&#x201D; Emma immediately threw away all hesitation, &#x201C;Although Jupiter&#x2019;s Lightning had duped us, we were much stronger than they had anticipated. This was especially so in another world, where their Radiant Moon could not intrude. While we did suffer a bit, we managed to break out, and while searching for the road back we found out about the firasource stones.&#x201D;</p><p>Emma sounded emotional, &#x201C;How can we let go of this treasure that can amplify soul force? We three Morning Star Warlocks thus led the way and took in a few oppressed races within the Atlan Union, creating the organisation, the Triserpent Sect. On the surface, we want to overthrow the government of Atlan, but in reality, we prioritise gathering firasource stones!&#x201D;</p><p>Leylin nodded. In this meeting, he had found that the two Dukes&#x2019; soul undulations were obviously much more powerful than in the Magus World. It seemed to be the effect from the firasource stones!</p><p>&#x201C;Then&#x2026; where&#x2019;s the First Elder?&#x201D; Leylin asked, and the atmosphere immediately became gloomy. A long while later, Gilbert spoke, his voice hoarse.</p><p>&#x201C;There are many powerful beings in the Lava World. At the peak are a few who have a strength similar to Radiant Moon Magi. At the beginning, with the three of us working together, everything went smoothly, and we even seized quite a lot of firasource stones. However, the organisation Jupiter&#x2019;s Lightning set up here was obviously much larger, and even had relations with the higher ups in Atlan. The head of their union was one who had trained up to the thirteenth level of the Fireplume technique, which was unheard of in history. He was a peak Radiant Moon Magus! Under his assault along with many other Magi, the First Elder fell&#x2026; while trying to protect us&#x2026;&#x201D;</p><p>Though Gilbert explained it in a simplified manner, Leylin could tell how desperate that battle had been. He could keenly tell that Gilbert had concealed some things.</p><p>Whatever it was, he would never believe the First Elder was so selfless, but Gilbert and Emma had not asked why Leylin had not come here right after the battle and instead done so only now. Leylin thus would not make his opinion known.</p><p>&#x201C;This means Mentor and Madam Emma are preparing to stay here for a period of time and conspire to obtain more firasource stones? In that case, we can collaborate!&#x201D; Leylin touched his chin. He held the same thoughts as these two Morning Star Warlocks. With two Morning Star helpers, he had more confidence.</p><p>&#x201C;That&#x2019;s great. With you joining us, Leylin, our strength will increase by a large amount, and we will even have a way to retreat!&#x201D; Emma and Gilbert exchanged a glance, the elation obvious in their eyes.</p><p>It looked like they had been planning to cause a huge ruckus before leaving this world.</p><p>Leylin could not help but feel his scalp tingle. The unrestrained attacks of three Morning Star Warlocks would definitely throw the entire Atlan Union into chaos.</p><p>However, this was none of his business. As long as he could obtain enough firasource stones, he didn&#x2019;t mind pushing the union into the abyss, or breaking it into smithereens.</p><p>Leylin patted his head, suddenly remembering something as he spoke. &#x201C;Right! I&#x2019;m lying low in the Special Task Force in Atlan for now. In order to obtain their trust, I destroyed a few of Triserpent Sect&#x2019;s strongholds&#x2026;&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;It doesn&#x2019;t matter. Those are just the surrounding organisations. We can just create a few more soon. To really obtain their full trust, it doesn&#x2019;t matter even if we hand over the whole Triserpent Sect.&#x201D;</p><p>Gilbert waved his arms, not minding the least.</p><p>&#x201C;In actuality, we&#x2019;ve also been keeping a low profile in the Atlan Union and even obtained titles. Most of the intel regarding the Triserpent Sect was intentionally divulged by us!&#x201D; Emma laughed, a layer of sparkling red feathers appearing on her body.</p><p>&#x201C;The Emberwings and Fireplume,&#x201D; Leylin chuckled. Morning Star Warlocks were all grandmasters at remodelling bloodlines. With Emma and Gilbert&#x2019;s experience, passing off an identity as an Emberwing was way too easy.</p><p>On top of that, these two were ruthless and had even sold away their organisation just to obtain trust. That was probably how they gained their titles, and why they did not mind Leylin&#x2019;s actions.</p><p>Leylin was rather speechless at that, feeling like he still needed to learn much more from his seniors in these dark areas. If the followers of the Triserpent Sect found out they had been betrayed by their leaders, they would probably just break down.</p><p>Leylin could not help but begin to pity them.</p><p>&#x201C;Do you have any intel?&#x201D; Leylin asked. These two Warlocks had been laying low here for longer than he had, and definitely knew more secrets.</p><p>&#x201C;Of course!&#x201D; Gilbert laughed proudly.</p><p>&#x201C;Based on our sources, there is only one place where the firasource stones are being generated, and that&#x2019;s the capital of the Atlan Union&#x2014; Tylasus! It only comes from the head himself, which means the source is being controlled by him. There are very few reserves outside!&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;The head who is at the thirteenth level of Fireplume, the peak of Radiant Moon?&#x201D; Leylin sighed lightly, knowing things were going to get troublesome.</p><p>Three Morning Stars cooperating was still not enough to snatch something from this opponent.</p><p>That was not all. Fighting in another world, foreign beings like them obviously had a disadvantage compared to the people of this land. The World&#x2019;s Will itself would also have a bias and help its own people, and even if a peak Radiant Moon were to head over, they might not be able to deal with this opponent.</p><p>&#x201C;Gilbert and I have already set up a plan. We&#x2019;re planning to sneak into Tylasus two months later, on the Holy Solar Day. You&#x2019;re just in time!&#x201D; Emma exclaimed.</p><p>Leylin touched his chin. Holy Solar Day was a very important festival of the Emberwings. During that time, the head would have to make a speech, participate in the feast and whatnot. There were more than enough opportunities to sneak into his residence.</p><p></p><hr><p></p>
