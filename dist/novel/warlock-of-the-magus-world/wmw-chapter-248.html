<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>The Appearance of Rank 2 Magus</strong></span></p><p>&#x201C;Giant, when you first decided to exploit me to detonate the seal, did you ever imagine that things would turn out like this?&#x201D;</p><p>Leylin slowly walked forward, a strange look in his eyes.</p><p>He calmly raised his blood-red right hand, preparing to send out another magical attack!</p><p>*Xiu!* At this very moment, a figure separated from Giant&#x2019;s body, the energy waves from its body indicating that it was also a peak rank 1 Magus! It pounced towards Leylin at a very high speed.</p><p>&#x201C;Eye of Hallucination!&#x201D; After this command, an apparition of a vertical eye appeared behind this figure.</p><p>The apparition let out dusky light with various colours flashing past. Anyone who even chanced a glance at it would be dazzled and feel dizzy.</p><p>Two black magic artifacts in the form of daggers appeared in the figure&#x2019;s hands, moving like a viper as they struck towards Leylin&#x2019;s vital areas.</p><p>This attack was very sudden, and the assailant was a peak rank 1 Magus who specialised in sneak attacks. Even if it was a Magus like Marb, he would suffer greatly!</p><p>Strangely enough, there were no signs of shock on Leylin&#x2019;s face. Instead what appeared was a grin as if he had expected it.</p><p>&#x201C;You&#x2019;ve finally appeared?&#x201D;</p><p>Next, a cross-shaped, dark red pendant over his neck produced large amounts of dull red rays of light, and his body was covered with a layer of dense scales.</p><p>Leylin&#x2019;s eyes had also turned into amber vertical pupils. Two rays of petrifying light were shot out of his eyes, piercing into the apparition of the vertical eye.</p><p>&#x201C;Ahh!&#x201D; Ashen gray rays of petrification ripped open the apparition, and a circle of petrification spread throughout the body of the black figure, causing him to yell miserably.</p><p>&#x201C;Crimson Palm!&#x201D; Leylin&#x2019;s hands were covered with three layers of protection. The innermost layer was black &#x2014; the Kemoyin&#x2019;s Scales. The middle one was a dull red &#x2014; an apparition from the Falling Star Pendant &#x2014; and the outermost one was the protection from Crimson Palm&#x2019;s flames.</p><p>The three layers produced different colours as they alternately sparkled on Leylin&#x2019;s hands.</p><p>Leylin welcomed the two black daggers that were headed for him.</p><p>*Boom! Boom!*</p><p>Though the black daggers emitted the energy waves of middle-grade magic artifacts, they bounced away from Leylin.</p><p>Leylin&#x2019;s Crimson Palm then unhesitatingly struck the chest of the black figure.</p><p>*Rumble!*</p><p>It was obvious that the black figure&#x2019;s chest had caved in, and it was coupled with the ear-piercing sound of bones breaking.</p><p>*Boom!* The figure was flung to the ground, revealing a Magus that Leylin was very familiar with.</p><p>&#x201C;Team leader Caesar, what are you doing here? And can you also explain why you chose to appear in such a strange way?&#x201D;</p><p>Leylin came before Caesar and enquired.</p><p>From his tone, it was obvious that Leylin was not surprised at Caesar&#x2019;s appearance here.</p><p>&#x201C;Cough cough&#x2026;&#x201D; The dark figure who had launched a sneak attack was, as expected, Caesar.</p><p>However, he looked to be in a bad state, constantly coughing out blood, and his face ashen. Around his third vertical eye on his forehead, there was a ring of gray stone. This was the effect of the Eye of Petrification, and it was still spreading.</p><p>&#x201C;You&#x2026;... When did you find out?&#x201D; Caesar did not reply to Leylin&#x2019;s question, and instead, countered with another question.</p><p>&#x201C;From the very beginning! In all honesty, I really admire you for daring to train in &#x201C;Three Spirits In A Body&#x201D;, which is an extremely dangerous ancient secret technique. You actually succeeded and forcefully separated your spirit into three portions!&#x201D;</p><p>Admiration was apparent in Leylin&#x2019;s expression.</p><p>He had previously used the A.I. Chip to simulate Caesar&#x2019;s trump card, and then heavily researched about ancient secret techniques like these.</p><p>Even in ancient times, these kinds of techniques were considered to be very dangerous. Only lunatics would choose to train in them, as they forcefully separated a Magus&#x2019; soul into three parts, each having their own will, and having the ability to be spread apart or merged together in crucial moments.</p><p>In other words, a person would be separated into three individuals. As long as a single body remained alive, the other 2 bodies could be resurrected given enough resources.</p><p>This was basically a secret technique that defied the heavens.</p><p>The situation was now very obvious.</p><p>Caesar, Giant, and the little boy were the different bodies of a single Magus who practised &#x201C;Three Spirits In A Body,&#x201D; and Caesar was a spy who was buried the deepest in Four Seasons Garden, and the instigator of this entire thing!</p><p>Leylin had found it strange that the Thousand Meddling Hands knew so much about the Four Seasons Garden, were able to come up with a spell design to destroy the seal linked to the core body of consciousness, and possessed a map of the locations of the defense squads.</p><p>From the looks of it, with Caesar, the leader of the hunting team, as a spy, everything made sense.</p><p>Caesar forced a laugh, &#x201C;It&#x2019;s far from a success. Originally, if the boy had been able to become a peak rank 1 Magus as well, I would have been able to merge all three bodies and try to advance to become a rank 2 Magus! It&#x2019;s a pity, though&#x2026;&#x201D;</p><p>While speaking, a ring of stone-like skin had spread from the sides of Caesar&#x2019;s third eye, almost reaching his nose.</p><p>&#x201C;Why did you lure us here?&#x201D;</p><p>Caesar asked while lying on the ground, without activating any defence formation. He was now aware that he would not be able to withstand even a blow from Leylin and was not going to humiliate himself by trying to protect himself.</p><p>&#x201C;You&#x2019;re smart! I want to make a trade with you. I hope that...&#x201D;</p><p>&quot;No! Don&#x2019;t listen to him! Kill him! I want to kill him!&#x201D; Giant, who was seriously injured, began to yell.</p><p>Leylin sighed as he held his head, &#x201C;Looks like I have to take care of all the troublesome matters first!&#x201D;</p><p>He could clearly tell that out of all the three bodies that Caesar had, only Caesar himself was relatively sane. Giant and the little boy obviously had a few screws loose, which might have been a side effect of the technique.</p><p>The little boy&#x2019;s craziness was possibly even a level above Giant. After his death, his maniacal tendencies were transferred to Giant.</p><p>Out of everyone present, Caesar was probably the only one willing to listen to his proposition. Giant was just an obstruction!</p><p>At this thought, Leylin&#x2019;s eyes were filled with a murderous aura; he was prepared to act right away!</p><p>Even if Giant and the little boy died, Caesar would still be able to revive them given a lot of resources, and as long as he was still around. It would just take a little more time.</p><p>Caesar and Giant were currently heavily injured, and it was impossible for them to fight back.</p><p>&#x201C;Young man, can you stop now?&#x201D;</p><p>Just as Leylin was about to move forward and deal the final blow to Giant, an aged voice sounded by his ear.</p><p>A silver ring of spiritual force descended upon the battlefield.</p><p>This spiritual force was incredibly malicious and strong, to the point that the air was distorting. Silver spiritual force formed a large hand, which picked up Giant.</p><p>The silver hand formed out of spiritual force was extremely sturdy. The flames from Leylin&#x2019;s Crimson Palm were still burning fiercely, but there seemed to be no effect on the hand.</p><p>Grains of solidified spiritual force constantly fluttered around, slowly extinguishing the crimson flames on Giant&#x2019;s legs.</p><p>&#x201C;Spiritual force solidification!&#x201D;</p><p>As he watched the silver, solidified spiritual force, Leylin suddenly thought back to the Gargamel that he had seen previously.</p><p>That being formed out of evilness also had the strength of a rank 2 Magus, and at that point in time, Leylin was basically helpless against it.</p><p>&#x201C;A rank 2 Magus from the Thousand Meddling Hands?&#x201D;</p><p>Leylin halted his footsteps.</p><p>The silver hand sent the heavily wounded Giant before a Magus donned in black robes.</p><p>This Magus was tall and slender but was surrounded by a terrifying spiritual force that even Leylin was fearful of. His eyes were a sparkling green, and anyone who saw him would feel immense fear from the evilness they gave off.</p><p>&#x201C;Father! Father! After killing my &#x2018;little boy&#x2019; spirit, he actually tried to kill me, the only member of your bloodline! He must pay the price in blood!&#x201D;</p><p>Giant curled up beside the dark Magus, beginning to wail like a little child.</p><p>Caesar, on the other side, called out &#x2018;Father&#x2019;, his face ashen.</p><p>&#x201C;So this dark Magus is actually Caesar&#x2019;s father!&#x201D; Leylin realised. However, something that the rank 2 dark Magus threw over made him feel anxious.</p><p>It was the head of a Magus. Its skin was pale, and its face was full of wrinkles. Leylin was extremely familiar with this face, as he had actually seen it not long ago.</p><p>&#x201C;Reynold! You actually killed him!&#x201D; Leylin&#x2019;s eyes widened.</p><p>This rank 2 Magus was even more powerful than Leylin had expected, to actually be able to behead Reynold, who was also a rank 2 Magus!</p><p>*Pak!* at this moment, the petrification on Caesar&#x2019;s face had extended to his neck, and his expression was still as if he had become a statue.</p><p>*Rumble!*</p><p>A streak of green flames began to burn, and the dark Magus traversed through space and arrived in front of Caesar.</p><p>&#x201C;Ancient Petrification Technique?&#x201D; His voice was hoarse, like two metal pieces scraping against each other.</p><p>&#x201C;Don&#x2019;t worry, my child!&#x201D; The dark Magus extended a pair of thin arms, which had green spores on them, and caressed Caesar&#x2019;s stone head.</p><p>*Bzzz!* Milky white light descended onto Caesar&#x2019;s head.</p><p>Within the light, greyish white stone skin fell off bit by bit, revealing Caesar&#x2019;s original skin tone.</p><p>&#x201C;Thank you, father! Also, he&#x2026;&#x201D; Caesar began to whisper in the dark Magus&#x2019; ear, and the Magus constantly nodded.</p><p>Upon seeing this scene, Giant, who was not far away, glared furiously like a child who had his sweets stolen. There was even some jealousy as he stared hard at Caesar.</p><p>&#x201C;Aren&#x2019;t you all the same person? Are you jealous of yourself?&#x201D;</p><p>Leylin was speechless.</p><p>At this point, Caesar was done speaking. The rank 2 Magus turned his gaze to Leylin.</p><p>A powerful burst of spiritual force was fixed upon Leylin, to the point that he felt as if he was standing stark naked in a field of snow.</p><p></p><hr><p></p>
