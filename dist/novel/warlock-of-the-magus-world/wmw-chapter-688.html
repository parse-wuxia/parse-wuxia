<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>Thorned Thunderbird</strong></span></p><p>&#x201C;How brazen of you, intruding into the restricted area of the Lyers Family!&#x201D; The Magi surrounding Leylin and Jorgian wore robes and had long, ocean blue hair. To his surprise, these silver-pupiled, fair-skinned people had an obvious aura from a bloodline on them. They were a group of Warlocks!</p><p>&#x2018;Bloodline Warlocks! I never thought there&#x2019;d be Warlock inheritances in the subterranean world!&#x2019; Light flashed in Leylin&#x2019;s eyes.</p><p>&#x2018;No, this is only to be expected. After all, the subterranean world is much more vast than the surface world, and it&#x2019;s normal for there to be ancient Warlock inheritances. I just never expected that there would be Warlocks protecting the other side of the tunnel in the Eternal Plains pocket dimension&#x2026;&#x2019;</p><p>Leylin surveyed his surroundings. The Warlocks surrounding them looked very young, but this was a side-effect of their bloodlines. They were in face much older, and the aged aura created a huge contrast with their handsome faces.</p><p>&#x2018;They&#x2019;re at least rank 2&#x2026; Also, this bloodline?&#x2019; A light blue tint covered Leylin&#x2019;s eyes. The surrounding Warlocks were just as shocked seeing that two people had been able to exit the restricted area.</p><p>;A.I. Chip, scan their bloodlines and match it with the database!; Leylin commanded inside his mind.</p><p>These Warlocks were under Morning Star, and did not notice any of Leylin&#x2019;s actions. The A.I. Chip quickly obtained what he wanted.</p><p>[Collection of bloodline data complete. Comparing with database&#x2026; Determined to be ancient Thorned Thunderbird.]</p><p>Immediately after, the A.I. Chip showed all information on the ancient Thorned Thunderbird.</p><p>[Beep! Ancient Thorned Thunderbird, rank 6 being! Rumoured to be descendant of the primordial Thunderbird. Possesses powerful thunder and lightning abilities and soundwave attacks. Likes to dwell in areas with plentiful metal elementals. Evaluation: Incomparably dangerous. The nemesis of ancient metal race!]</p><p>&#x201C;Bloodline Warlocks from rank 6 beings! No wonder I felt the bloodline giving me some slight pressure!&#x201D;</p><p>Leylin watched the surrounding Warlocks with some pity in his eyes, &#x201C;It&#x2019;s a pity that the Warlocks&#x2019; bloodlines have weakened quite a bit and can&#x2019;t be purified to its original rank 6!&#x201D;</p><p>The Warlocks surrounding Leylin might have bloodline from a rank 6 ancient Thorned Thunderbird, but their status was similar to the Black Horrall Snake Warlocks of the Ouroboros Clan. The bloodline had weakened and lost all the power from their ancestors.</p><p>&#x201C;However, since they exist, there must be powerful people within this Warlock family. I should be able to purify their bloodline&#x2026;&#x201D;</p><p>Leylin shot a glance at these Warlocks with malicious intent, giving them a feeling as if calamity loomed.</p><p>&#x201C;However, this is the Lyers family&#x2019;s restricted area, and you intentionally got these adventurers to enter. Seems like there&#x2019;s some unspeakable secret inside&#x2026;&#x201D;</p><p>Leylin thought about it for a while and did not eliminate the possibility of the Lyers family giving out this news in order to get blood sacrifices, attracting adventurers to come and explore.</p><p>If that was the case, it would explain why Jorgian and his crew were obviously low-ranked, but could enter the ruins without obstructions.</p><p>&#x201C;Why are you still talking to them? All Magi who sully our Lyers Family have only the ending of death!&#x201D;</p><p>The Warlocks of the Lyers family were urged on by someone like a leader and immediately chose to attack without hesitation. Fine, minute static electricity force field were produced from their bodies, forming a powerful domain that kept Leylin and Jorgian within. Leylin could practically feel their bloodlust, and they evidently wanted to keep them here no matter the cost.</p><p>&#x201C;This spell?&#x201D; Seeing these Warlocks all having blue electricity shooting everywhere that formed a large-scaled static electricity field that merged and amplified each other, Leylin looked slightly interested.</p><p>[Rank 1 spell: Static electricity field! Determined to be opponent&#x2019;s rank 1 innate spell that can produce static electricity force field on a large scale. Energy consumption at the minimum, and has effects of amplifying each other.]</p><p>The A.I. Chip transmitted the functions of the spell at this moment.</p><p>&#x201C;Kill him!&#x201D; The leader donned a layer of lightning armour, and two gigantic blue bright wings stretched behind his back, causing his speed to suddenly increase. He almost turned into a streak of blue lightning.</p><p>[Rank 2 Thorned Thunderbird Warlock Bloodline Spell determined to be: Lightning Armour, rank 3 bloodline spell: Wings of Lightning.]</p><p>Through the opponent&#x2019;s bloodline activities and spells, the A.I. Chip managed to gather much information, and large amounts of data was showed in front of Leylin.</p><p>&#x201C;As expected of an ancient rank 6 bloodline. These innate abilities are very practical!&#x201D;</p><p>Leylin sighed slightly. It was a pity that there were no Morning Star Warlocks in their midst. No matter how useful a spell, they were pointless if they did not reach a certain level.</p><p>&#x201C;Break!&#x201D; Leylin spat out a syllable and terrifying darkness-type elemental particles spread like a rising tide.</p><p>Surging energy particles thundered as they turned into a giant beast with a weapon, attacking the opponents&#x2019; joint static electricity forcefield.</p><p>*Tss tss!* Blue sparks flashed and mixed with streams of black gas. Immediately after, there was a dull sound of thunder, and even the ground shook.</p><p>Miserable cries rose and fell in succession, and the Thunderbird Warlocks who were only rank 1 and 2 crumpled to the ground.</p><p>*Chiu chiu!* The leader in the air who saw this emitted a piercing cry, turning and then transforming into lightning and leaving.</p><p>&#x201C;Get down here!&#x201D;</p><p>Leylin&#x2019;s eyes were never on him, but a faint image of a double-headed black snake had already appeared on him, four blood-red eyes giving him a dead stare.</p><p>&#x201C;Hss hss!&#x201D; The snake kept flicking its tongue and quickly drew this leader into its mouth. Blue lightning flashed everywhere and then disappeared.</p><p>The double-headed black snake meandered to the ground and spat out the leader. However, he had already fainted, and the lightning around his body had disappeared without a trace.</p><p>&#x201C;Too weak. Much too weak! This extent&#x2026;&#x201D;</p><p>Leylin narrowed his eyes. A bloodline like this wasn&#x2019;t enough to even arouse his interest to extract it.</p><p>&#x201C;My- my lord! We&#x2026;&#x201D; At the other side, Jorgian, who had seen Leylin and Lyers fighting had been so afraid that he&#x2019;d fainted before.</p><p>The Lyers family&#x2019;s reputation was like a sun in the sky within the Arthur Empire. It was said they had a Morning Sar in charge. Wasn&#x2019;t this Magus seeking death by provoking him?</p><p>However, the crux of the issue was that whether Leylin or the Lyers family, Jorgian could not afford to offend either side and almost burst into tears.</p><p>&#x201C;I&#x2019;ll wait for a while more here. Leave first!&#x201D; Leylin shooed him away.</p><p>&#x201C;How&#x2013; How can I leave my lord behind to confront the Lyers family?&#x201D; He hesitated, but Leylin obviously could tell.</p><p>&#x201C;Once their reinforcements come, it wouldn&#x2019;t be just these sort of low-ranked characters. What, you mean you&#x2019;re thinking of going against the Lyers family with me?&#x201D;</p><p>Leylin had a half-smile on his face as he watched Jorgian.</p><p>&#x201C;No, no, my lord! I shall take my leave first!&#x201D; He immediately turned pale and fled at lightning-speed after bowing, as if there was some ferocious beast chasing him.</p><p>Watching his back, Leylin shook his head. He was just a tiny character after all, and if he really did stay, unafraid of death, he&#x2019;d definitely be affected . Choosing to leave was a rather sensible decision.</p><p>Now, Leylin could not be bothered with this boy. He watched a trace of lightning shooting over from the distance, a smile lighting up his face slightly.</p><p>&#x201C;Chiu chiu!&#x201D; It was as if tens of thousands of birds were calling at the same time. When the lightning disappeared, there was another figure in the sky.</p><p>&#x201C;You attacked them?&#x201D; The newcomer was very young, and his brows were furrowed in his anger. He&#x2019;d evidently been angered by the miserable state of the many Lyers family Warlocks on the ground.</p><p>&#x201C;They offended me. I&#x2019;ve been benevolent enough not to kill them. If I did things like I usually do, they can only descend to the underworld and repent for their sins!&#x201D; Leylin shrugged.</p><p>*Huala!* White electric current streaked past, as if tearing through the sky. In mid air, the Warlock&#x2019;s overbearing and furious words could be heard, &#x201C;Good, very good! Then I&#x2019;ll let you see a bit of my &#x2018;benevolence&#x2019;!&#x201D;</p><p>Terrifying energy from someone who had reached the realm of a rank 4 Warlock and attaining Morning Star burst from his body. Countless dark clouds converged, enveloping the whole region.</p><p>*Rumble!* Eight blue pillars of light instantly descended. Boundless lightning shot out from the pillars, forming a large purgatory.</p><p>Lightning and fire gathered in purgatory and trapped Leylin within.</p><p>[Rank 4 Thorned Thunderbird Warlock Bloodline Spell determined to be: Berserk Lightning Prison.] The A.I. Chip projected the opponent&#x2019;s spell before Leylin at this moment.</p><p>&#x201C;A rank 4 spell. Looks like I have to get a little serious!&#x201D;</p><p>Leylin&#x2019;s expression became grimmer. He, who now was struck by the Curse Mark of Ten Thousand Snakes, could only display Morning Star strength and was on par with the opponent.</p><p>*Chi chi! Huala!* Numerous electricity snakes surrounded by flames opened their mouths full of blood and devoured Leylin.</p><p>Dazzling lightning was very harsh on the eyes, but a hint of black rays leaked from the electricity.</p><p>The black radiance grew until it cut through the lightning, turning into an illusory, terrifying giant serpent and appeared behind Leylin.</p><p>&#x201C;Hss&#x2026;&#x201D; The serpent had shackles with metallic stings, but it still paid that no mind as it snarled at the lightning clouds in the sky.</p><p>&#x201C;Warlock? Such a terrifying an evil bloodline force?&#x201D;</p><p>From within the thunderclouds, the Warlocks&#x2019; bewildered voice could be heard. Following which, the voice silenced and turned into the piercing sounds of rumbling.</p><p>*Chiu chiu!*</p><p>A streak of dazzling blue radiance abruptly burst forth from the clouds, landing on Leylin&#x2019;s shoulder.</p><p>&#x201C;Booming Thunderclap!&#x201D; The opponent&#x2019;s voice only reached Leylin after the electricity struck Leylin.</p><p></p><hr><p></p>
