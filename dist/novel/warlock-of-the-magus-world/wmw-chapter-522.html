<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>Changes in Contract</strong></span></p><p>After the banquet ended, Leylin decided to stay at the Blood Castle for a while. During this period, he constantly received intelligence about the situation at Crystal Mountain.</p><p>The Crystal Mountains was the main area where the conflict with Jupiter&#x2019;s Lightning happened, a mountain range that was located near the aisle of Arcelor. The Crystal Mountains were named so because of its production of a type of high energy crystal ore.</p><p>This ore could, to an extent, replace magic crystals as a power source for puppets, or to build formations and artifacts. This led to a decent demand for the ore, which kept the prices high.</p><p>It could be found everywhere on Crystal Mountain, even on the surface. This made extracting the ore easy, causing the place to be regarded as a natural source of wealth.</p><p>Of course, even so, it could only entice weaker Magi. It wasn&#x2019;t nearly enough to draw the eyes of Morning Stars.</p><p>Ore mines of such quality were already present in Jupiter&#x2019;s Lightning, Spirit Circle, and even within the Ouroboros Clan. It wasn&#x2019;t worth a fight between Morning Stars.</p><p>The real worth arose from a rumour about the place. Legends recounted that this was originally the headquarters of an ancient large-scaled Magus organisation&#x2014; Scarlet Crescent. During the war, the ancient Magi had peered into the future and decided to conceal the entire region with spell formations. They left their heritage there, and it would only appear when it was time.</p><p>Many Magi had brushed this off in the beginning in mockery, calling it nonsense. But on-site inspections by Cybel and the others revealed that those remains indeed existed, and even hid enormous wealth!</p><p>Jupiter&#x2019;s Lightning had learned of this information at the same time. As such, there was a disagreement about the ownership of Crystal Mountain. Battle soon ensued.</p><p>Both sides had shown restraint in the beginning. The battle was restricted to a small spatial rift, and only involved those at or above the Morning Star rank.</p><p>But when the Radiant Moon Magus found himself at a disadvantage against the combined forces of the three Giant Kemoyin Serpent Warlocks and Cybel, he felt extremely embarrassed. Thus, this matter abruptly intensified.</p><p>What followed was the three Dukes being lost in the astral plane, and the allied armies besieging the Ouroboros Clan in the midst of trickery.</p><p>Were it not for the unexpected factor called Leylin, the Ouroboros Clan could possibly have been annihilated in this tempest, ending the legacy of the Giant Kemoyin Serpent Warlocks in the continent.</p><p>&#x2018;You merely had a small disadvantage, and your revenge was already so vicious...&quot; Leylin had already formed an image of the Radiant Moon Magus of Jupiter&#x2019;s Lightning. He was a cruel, petty man. Normally, such characters were not to be feared, but once one fellow possessed such enormous abilities, Leylin would dread meeting him.</p><p>&#x201C;According to rumours and the data collected by mentor and his team, the surfacing time of the remains of the Scarlet Crescent would be when the sun, stars and moon converge and when the arc of Oake appears&#x2026;&#x201D;</p><p>Leylin put down the &#x2018;top secret&#x2019; documents, and the A.I. Chip began calculations.</p><p>[Time format identified to be from the ancient era. Converting into the calendar used by the central continent, date is approaching soon&#x2026;]</p><p>Leylin stroked his chin, &#x201C;No wonder the struggle got so violent that they even wanted to get me involved&#x2026;&#x201D;</p><p>As for the intentions of Spirit Circle and Wind Wolf Lair, he was very clear on what they wanted. They might have made some pact with the three Morning Star Warlocks of the Ouroboros Clan previously, setting regulations about the distribution of the spoils.</p><p>The other party in the pact had disappeared, but the contract still stood. And yet, they were unwilling to just transfer these benefits to him.</p><p>As such, getting him involved and having him represent the Ouroboros Clan, they wanted to rework the pact imminently. If they didn&#x2019;t they&#x2019;d have to share all the benefits they painfully acquired with Leylin, and it was not a welcome thought.</p><p>However, even Leylin agreed with this matter. Simply put, the benefits were meant to be for the three Morning Star Warlocks. And now, although the benefits had been reduced by a little, they were meant solely for him.</p><p>He was, after all, the sole representative of the Ouroboros Clan, possessing the right to negotiate on their behalf. Thus, it was understandable that they&#x2019;d give up a few things to garner his support.</p><p>In this scenario, the gains of the Ouroboros Clan, on the whole, would reduce, but he would have good profits himself. With that being the case, why wouldn&#x2019;t he agree?</p><p>&#x201D;Lord Leylin, are you there?&#x201D; Paul&#x2019;s voice suddenly sounded from outside.</p><p>&#x201D;I&#x2019;m here!&#x201D; Leylin replied as he opened the door.</p><p>&#x201D;If you have made your decision, we can proceed with the contract alteration ceremony!&#x201D; Paul smiled as he conveyed the message.</p><p>&#x201C;Certainly!&#x201D; Leylin nodded his head and followed Paul to the hall.</p><p>Those present numbered five. Along with two spirit Warlocks were Cybel, Palesa, and Philip. In the centre of the tiny hall was a long table dressed with a red tablecloth. On it was the contract, along with a goose-feather pen and ink.</p><p>Leylin trembled the moment he stepped foot into the hall. He felt as if he&#x2019;d entered a boundless domain, one filled with an air of righteousness.</p><p>&#x201C;This is the domain of righteousness! This place was the witness when we signed the contract with the three duke the last time too&#x2026;.&#x201D; Cybel explained.</p><p>Contracts made among Morning Star Magi could not be broken. With the included effectiveness of this binding, the pact was absolute. No wonder Cybel, that old monster, still had no choice but to follow the rules and make allowances for Leylin, getting him to alter the contract.</p><p>Leylin walked towards the table, scrutinising the slight differences between the old contract and the new.</p><p>The new one halved the Ouroboros Clan&#x2019;s benefits, causing Leylin to knit his brow. But under the column that noted the beneficiary, the name had been changed. The names of the three Dukes had been replaced with Leylin Farlier.</p><p>The three Dukes had placed the condition upon Cybel that, were they to die, the benefits would be transferred to the Ouroboros Clan. Now, it was all being handed over to Leylin.</p><p>&#x201C;How is it? If there is any problem, feel free to tell us. We will address it and make the changes right away!&#x201D;</p><p>The urgency in Cybel&#x2019;s tone was evident; the time for the revelation of the remains was drawing near, after all. If they hadn&#x2019;t even solved internal issues, how were they to vie over other things?</p><p>Leylin closed his eyes for a second as he pondered before asking, &#x201C;The contract states that additional spoils will be distributed on the basis of military strength and contribution. Exactly what are the criteria?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Of course, it will be based on the achievements of the Morning Stars!&#x201D; Cybel answered without hesitation. In his opinion, the troops below the Morning Star realm weren&#x2019;t even worth consideration.</p><p>&#x201C;Very well. I wish to add another clause, regarding emergency evacuations. In the event that one encounters an irresistible strength, namely an opponent at the Radiant Moon realm, we are permitted to use any methods we wish to exit the battlefield. This will not change the distribution of the spoils. Any objections?&#x201D;</p><p>Leylin presented himself like one who specialised in law and litigation. Cybel and the others were stunned and they exchanged glances with one another.</p><p>&#x201C;If that is what you wish, sure!&#x201D; Cybel nodded his head, and Philip immediately stepped forward, making the alterations with the goose feather pen.</p><p>&#x201C;I have no other issues!&#x201D;</p><p>After ironing out some disputes, Leylin finally nodded his head in agreement. He took out a seal from his chest and stamped on the contract.</p><p>*Weng!* After the seal was stamped, an image appeared on the light yellow paper. It was that of a black snake biting its own tail swivelling around unceasingly.</p><p>This was the official seal of the Ouroboros Clan. It was originally held and controlled by the previous three Giant Kemoyin Serpent Warlocks, and now it was in Leylin&#x2019;s hand.</p><p>Fortunately, due to some unknown reasons, the three dukes had signed the contract under the Ouroboros Clan&#x2019;s name, otherwise, Leylin would not have been able to make the amendments.</p><p>After the last seal had been stamped solemnly by the last Morning Star Warlock on the contract, the power of righteousness in the hall rose to the limit.</p><p>The new contract gradually floated into the air, glowing a beautiful golden yellow as the old contract silently turned into a pile of ash.</p><p>&#x201C;Alright, let us discuss the next arrangements&#x2026;&#x201D;</p><p>With the contract successfully altered, Cybel and the other Morning Star Warlocks seemed to have been refreshed with confidence and started to develop positive feelings for Leylin. Cybel impatiently urged everyone to begin planning battle strategy; he clearly couldn&#x2019;t wait.</p><p>Leylin plastered a smile on his face, but deep inside he rolled his eyes.</p><p>&#x2018;How could I not alter it? I&#x2019;m alone, unlike the three mentors. If I&#x2019;d persisted, I would end up with nothing in the end, even attracting the malice of your two organisations&#x2026;&#x2019;</p><p>Weighing his options, Leylin had ultimately chosen to alter the contract. It was the best option under his current circumstances.</p><p>He believed that even if the three Dukes were to return from &#x2018;Purgatory&#x2019; they would not be displeased by his decision.</p><p>&#x201C;Within Jupiter&#x2019;s Lightning, other than the Radiant Moon Magus, there are over ten Morning Stars&#x2026;&#x201D; In the middle of a room that resembled a command center, Cybel slowly explained the details of Jupiter&#x2019;s Lightning, and Leylin was finally exposed to their strength.</p><p>&#x201C;The other party&#x2019;s leader will be pinned down by the Radiant Moon Warlock on our side, don&#x2019;t worry. We just need to take care of the remaining ten plus Morning Star Magi.</p><p>&#x201C;Many of Jupiter&apos;s Lightning&#x2019;s important territories and missions required Morning Star Magi to oversee them. As such, I suppose not more than nine Morning Star Magi will be at Crystal Mountain!&#x201D;</p><p>Cybel seemed to be very familiar with information about Jupiter&apos;s Lightning. He either had a specialised channel of information, or managed to ambush a spy.</p><p>&#x201C;Spirit Circle can take care of three!&#x201D; Paul remarked with surety.</p><p>&#x201C;Very well, Palesa and Philip will hold up two of them. That means we are down to four Morning Stars!&#x201D;</p><p></p><hr><p></p>
