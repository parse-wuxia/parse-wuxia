<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>Defeat</strong></span></p><p>The moment Clayde declared his name, Leylin gave out an order silently.</p><p>&quot;A.I. Chip, Scan the target in front of me!&quot;</p><p>[Beep! Mission establishing, scanning in progress... A defensive forcefield around the target detected, unable to collect data!]</p><p>As expected, the A.I. Chip still gave the same answer.</p><p>&quot;Which is to say, if I broke through the layer of forcefield, I&apos;ll be able to scan it?&quot;</p><p>Leylin used an immense force on his legs and charged towards Clayde like a bullet.</p><p>*Bang!*</p><p>Leylin&apos;s right hand bulged, and the strength of his fist reached 7.1 degrees, smashing onto Clayde&apos;s chest.</p><p>The sound like a hammer striking at leather sounded. With a huge spark, Clayde was sent flying backwards.</p><p>Leylin stood at where Clayde stood originally as he looked at his arm.</p><p>Black scales appeared above the skin. On the scales, there were tiny traces of flames continuously flickering.</p><p>[Data of target&apos;s defensive forcefield obtained, comparing to database!]</p><p>[Determined target&apos;s innate spell as high-temperature forcefield, creating a flame of 24 degrees to burn objects within its vicinity!]</p><p>[Target&apos;s forcefield damaged: 4.6%. 20 more strikes are estimated to break the defensive forcefield!]</p><p>The A.I. Chip reported to data to Leylin.</p><p>&quot;Cough cough...&quot;</p><p>At this moment, Clayde who was lying on the ground got up. There was soot on his somewhat dirtied face.</p><p>&quot;What tremendous speed and strength! A pity that you only advanced not too long ago, so how many rank 1 spell could you have learnt? Two? One? Or do you only have your innate forcefield?&quot;</p><p>Clayde patted his chest and yelled.</p><p>Often Magi, who just advanced were in their weakest stages, not to mention memorising a few rank 1 spells. More often than not, they could not afford a single use scroll or magic artifact either.</p><p>After Clayde had finished yelling, he chanted an incantation immediately.</p><p>The energy particles in the air changed visibly, shining a dazzling yellow light.</p><p>&quot;This might, at least 20 degrees...&quot;</p><p>Leylin&apos;s expression turned solemn. Right now his Kemoyin&apos;s Scales resistance was only at 27 degrees. It was considered pretty good amongst newly advanced Magi, but it could not fend off all of the rank 1 spells.</p><p>Only by continuously tapping into the strength of the bloodline, the Kemoyin&apos;s Scales would become stronger.</p><p>As for now, once the opponent&apos;s attack exceeded 27 degrees, it would immediately break through his forcefield.</p><p>&quot;I can&apos;t let him cast any spells!&quot; Leylin&apos;s pupils contracted</p><p>*Crash!* The black light flickered, and finely articulated scales surfaced on his body, even his face was included.</p><p>In an instant, Leylin was covered by a layer of snake&apos;s scales. He right now looked half snake and half human.</p><p>The blackness of the scales had an ancient aura and reflected a cold, glossy light which sent Clayde&apos;s heart racing a little faster.</p><p>&quot;Such a defensive forcefield? So strong!&quot;</p><p>&quot;Die!&quot; Leylin shouted, and he moved quicker than before, charging towards Clayde.</p><p>Clayde snorted, and a layer of green light appeared on his body which turned into thorns as they blocked Leylin.</p><p>*Bang!* *Bang!*</p><p>Leylin&apos;s expression did not change as he swung his fists. After two punches, the thorns shattered.</p><p>After covering himself with the Kemoyin&apos;s Scales and coupling it with his strength, Leylin was now like an ancient creature, with an aura that was unstoppable.</p><p>Clayde face turned rather unsightly after seeing Leylin breaking through the thorns like wild grass.</p><p>&quot;You damned worm! What other methods you have, use them all now!&quot;</p><p>Leylin howled and felt every drop of his blood being set ablaze. It made his appetite to battle even more intense than before.</p><p>&quot;Damn it!&quot; As Clayde chanted, he kept on changing positions. Moreover, he even activated several magic artifacts to block Leylin from advancing.</p><p>Although the might of these low-grade magic artifacts were not strong and mostly restraint type, breaking through them still required some effort.</p><p>After Leylin broke through another layer of ice, Clayde finally finished his incantation of a rank 1 spell. An enormous blue fireball was sent flying towards Leylin.</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>After the heat wave had dissipated, the mud around the area melted, creating a large pit.</p><p>&quot;Haha... No one could survive after being hit by my corrosive fireball!&quot;</p><p>Clayde laughed heartily. The joy of killing a genius early in developing stages swelled in his chest.</p><p>However, Clayde&apos;s expression very soon changed and he hurriedly retreated several steps, as if he saw something unfathomable.</p><p>&quot;How... How&apos;s this possible, he&apos;s actually still alive?&quot;</p><p>In the sea of blue fire, a human figure parted the flames and walked out from it.</p><p>At this moment, Leylin&apos;s clothes were thoroughly razed to ashes, revealing his scaly body. The A.I. Chip&apos;s warning continuously rang within his ear.</p><p>[Host has suffered an energy attack! Element: Fire, Acid. Estimated power: 20 degrees. Actual power: 26 degrees. Host&apos;s innate spell, Kemoyin&apos;s Scales, was activated! Energy consumed: 34%. No harm dealt directly to Host!]</p><p>&quot;It&apos;s actually an attack of 26 degrees. Just one more degree to breaking my defense!&quot;</p><p>Leylin had some lingering fear before it manifested into a stronger killing intent!</p><p>*Bang!* His figure flickered and appeared right in front of Clayde. The fist covered with scales punched Clayde&apos;s chest with a tremendous might.</p><p>*Crash!* A bright red flame rose from Clayde&apos;s chest, engulfing Leylin&apos;s fist within.</p><p>*Bang!* Clayde&apos;s face turned red as he was sent flying backwards.</p><p>Leylin stepped forward, ignoring the flames on his body as he throttled Clayde.</p><p>&quot;Run! Why don&apos;t you run again?&quot;</p><p>Leylin&apos;s expression turned malevolent, ramming fists after fists on Clayde&apos;s body.</p><p>*Bang!* *Bang!* *Bang!*</p><p>Massive explosions sounded continuously, and the earth quivered as if there was an earthquake.</p><p>Finally, after some time, Clayde cried out, and the flames on his body disappeared.</p><p>[Target&apos;s defensive forcefield broken, acquiring data...]</p><p>The A.I. Chip&apos;s voice intoned, bringing Leylin, who was somewhat frenzied back to his senses.</p><p>&quot;What happened? I was actually this impulsive and reckless?&quot;</p><p>Thinking of how he did not dodge or block as he smashed his opponent&apos;s defensive forcefield, cold sweat trickled down Leylin&apos;s forehead.</p><p>Normally he would have never acted that way. Not to mention the final barrage of attack like a madman was not his way of handling things usually.</p><p>[Clayde Lilytell. Strength: 4.5, Agility: 3.7, Vitality: 5.6, Spiritual force: 31. Elemental Essence Conversion: Fire! Progress: 30%...]</p><p>Clayde, who was lying on the ground, had his data extracted and sent to Leylin.</p><p>&quot;Elemental Essence Conversion? No wonder his acidic fireball was so strong!&quot; Realisation appeared on Leylin&apos;s face.</p><p>After advancing into a rank 1 Magus, if one wanted to advance again, the basic conditions was to complete the Elemental Essence Conversion!</p><p>At this time, the importance of having an affinity for elements was finally shown. If one does not choose the highest affinity element to cultivate in, it&apos;s impossible to have the Elemental Essence Conversion progress to get over 80%. Which is to say, they would never be able to advance into a rank 2 Magus!</p><p>Furthermore, with the increase in Elemental Essence Conversion, it would improve the might of spells of that particular element.</p><p>Originally Clayde&apos;s acidic fireball only had a power degree of 20. However, after the 30% Elemental Essence Conversion it reached 26 degrees, almost breaking Leylin&apos;s defenses.</p><p>Moreover, the multiplier effect could only be applied on one&apos;s chosen element affinity. For instance, Clayde&apos;s fiery spell could have a 30% multiplier, but the spells of other elements would remain the same. In cases such as Water or Ice Elements, the power might even be reduced.</p><p>However, why would Magi gifted with the affinity of Fire element even use Water and Ice spells?</p><p>Blue light flashed in Leylin&apos;s eyes continuously. This was the first report of data he obtained from a rank 1 Magus. It could aid his understanding towards himself, complete the database and even compare the stats to a Warlock&apos;s.</p><p>&quot;You... Kill me now! The Lilytell family will never let you off!&quot;</p><p>When the innate defensive forcefield of Magi was broken, they would also suffer damage on their sea of consciousness. At this moment, Clayde was already near his last breath.</p><p>&quot;Why do I suddenly feel like the villain?&quot;</p><p>Seeing Clayde, who put on a &apos;loyal and unyielding&apos; expression, Leylin wanted to laugh.</p><p>&quot;You wish for death? It&apos;s too early for that!&quot;</p><p>Leylin forcefully chugged a potion down Clayde&apos;s throat. Clayde&apos;s eyes turned white immediately, and he fainted. There were even some forbidden runes appearing on his body which isolated the branding of spell formation on his body.</p><p>After hastily cleaning up the area and packing his spoils, Leylin picked Clayde up and left the area.</p><p>With the vitality of 8.5, even if Leylin were to run for a day he would not be exhausted. The reason why he chose to ride a horse previously was just for convenience.</p><p>After running wildly for several li, Leylin then had the notion of checking his body status.</p><p>It worried him that he lost his control in the battle earlier.</p><p>&quot;A.I. Chip! Bring out the data monitored earlier and investigate the cause of losing control!&quot; Leylin managed to simmer down only after sitting in a refreshing stream and cooling off.</p><p>[Beep! Mission establishing! Bringing out monitored data!] The A.I. Chip intoned icily, not bringing any trace of emotion.</p><p>[14 Hours 23 Minutes, abnormal activities observed within Host. Blood flow increased by almost 45%, activity of the Giant Kemoyin Serpent blood essence significantly increased!]</p><p>The A.I. Chip reported the series of data to Leylin. Through a comparison, there was a strange stimulant released by the Giant Kemoyin Serpent&apos;s bloodline during the battle earlier. It was similar to doping, and the stimulation caused Leylin to lose his rationality.</p><p>&quot;This is the origin of the Warlocks&apos; emotional aftereffects?&quot;</p><p>Leylin muttered, immediately asking, &quot;A.I. Chip, bring out the best solutions to solve this!&quot;</p><p>[Beep! Method 1: Forsake the Giant Kemoyin Serpent! Method 2: Use the Serenity Potion! Method 3: ...]</p><p>Very soon, the A.I. Chip presented the possible solutions to Leylin.</p><p></p><hr><p></p>
