<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>Killing The Clone&#x2019;s Projection </strong></span></p><p>&#x201C;Why is the temperature rising at this rate?&#x201D; The old man swiftly took out the black notebook from his chest. Not only was the notebook heating up, traces of black currents swirled around it.</p><p>*Buzz!* With a sudden spike in the book&#x2019;s temperature, the old man scrunched his face up in pain as he subconsciously tossed it from his hand.</p><p>A big patch of the old man&#x2019;s hand was scalded from the momentary contact. White blisters started forming on its surface.</p><p>Even with a Magus&#x2019; physique and the protection of his innate spell, he was still injured this way!</p><p>*Woo woo&#x2026;*</p><p>&#x201C;The almighty Beelzebub, you are the king of hell, the darling of the original sins, with the control over gluttony. The desires for all cuisine lies in your hand....&#x201D;</p><p>The phantom became more intense as the chants and songs of praises filled the entire tomb area.</p><p>Leylin had seen such situations in the past, hence he immediately became vigilant. As for the old man and his grandson, they huddled together in a corner with looks of regret on their faces.</p><p>A black ray of light swept out from the notebook, and like a remnant of an illusion seeped into the stone rune on the coffin.</p><p>After the flow of light had dissipated, as if it had completed its mission, the notebook burned to ashes in front of their eyes.</p><p>Colourful light flowed out of the stone rune, and traces of this light started connecting with the Morning Star corpse.</p><p>Like lightning, the ray scanned through the tomb as the Morning Star corpse opened his eyes and once again descended upon this world!</p><p>&#x201C;I&#x2026; I&#x2026; Am I Ezekiel? Or Gordius?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;No! I am Beelzebub! Sovereign King of gluttony, Beelzebub!&#x201D;</p><p>The Magus&#x2019; eyes looked lost in the beginning, but they soon glowed brightly. His Morning Star domain had apparently descended, and both grandfather and grandson fell to the ground.</p><p>&#x201C;Morning Star! It&#x2019;s our Morning Star ancestor!&#x201D; By now, the corpse was sitting partially upright. The old man was ecstatic and was about to speak when a flash of ruthless light sparked from the corpse&#x2019;s face.</p><p>A ray of crimson red flashed across the old Magus and he disappeared immediately without a trace.</p><p>&#x201C;Mmm! A pretty good supplement! And it appears to be a direct descendant of the corpse too!&#x201D; The red glow in the Morning Star Magus&#x2019; eyes intensified. He stroked his belly and darted his eyes towards the young teenager.</p><p>&#x201C;Ah&#x2026;&#x201D; The scene a moment ago left the young teen on the verge of collapsing. He opened his mouth and attempted to speak, but could only murmur some incoherent words as his body froze up and stiffened.</p><p>The gaze from the Morning Star Magus did not linger for long on the young teen, as it swept its line of sight behind him instead.</p><p>&#x201C;Eh&#x2026;.&#x201D; Following an indistinct sigh, Leylin&#x2019;s silhouette emerged from the crevice.</p><p>&#x201C;Morning Star Magus?! You&#x2019;re the kid from before!&#x201D; The words spoken by the corpse in the coffin were filled with much astonishment, and a lot of deep seated hatred.</p><p>&#x201C;Indeed, projected clone of Beelzebub. It is I.&#x201D; Leylin admitted his identity magnanimously.</p><p>With the opposite party&#x2019;s gluttony imprint on him, Leylin couldn&#x2019;t deny the facts. And by now, he should have been able to discern all that had happened anyway.</p><p>During ancient times, Beelzebub&#x2019;s clone died and the remains had transformed itself to become a huge rune of gluttony, and thereafter he attempted to invade the different coordinates of the world of Magi.</p><p>Magi who attained the gluttony rune would have been tainted by the sin of gluttony, and hence have their appetites awakened. They would also get the ability to advance beyond their realms, and additionally with the power of gluttony in their body, they became potential host bodies for Beelzebub himself!</p><p>The Magus buried here was lucky to have obtained a remnant. And after his own Morning Star breakthrough, he seemed to have noticed something amiss and hence sealed himself in and isolated himself from the probe of Beelzebub.</p><p>Unfortunately, the notebook that he regularly carried around had been tainted over a long period of time, and it was even entrusted with by of spirit fragments.</p><p>After a very long time, his grandchild, bewitched by the notebook, had come forth to open the coffin and release the clone.</p><p>&#x201C;Unexpectedly, you have advanced to Morning Star!&#x201D;</p><p>The Magus possessed by Beelzebub looked extremely imposing. Every single move was filled with an imposing aura, and behind him the image of a huge demon appeared that vaguely resembled the king of hell.</p><p>&#x201C;How do you intend to compensate for my previous losses?&#x201D; It was odd that this clone did not pursue the matter further, and instead hinted at settling it.</p><p>Leylin looked even more baffled as he stepped up to the clone. He looked it right in the eye, &#x201C;Do you take me for a fool?&#x201D;</p><p>Once the words were spoken, the clone immediately changed colour. Leylin continued, &#x201D;As you are now, you aren&apos;t even a clone, but just a fragment of a spirit with some power of projection! Besides, this Morning Star Magus corpse&#x2019;s point mass has followed its spirit and returned to the astral plane. While this high-quality body has been contaminated by the power of gluttony, with your current reliance on this Morning Star body, how much strength can you exhibit?&#x201D;</p><p>*Buzz!* As the darkness loomed in, the earth looked like it had been isolated them from the outside world. Silver radiance filled the whole sky, and the stars scattered all around.</p><p>A real Morning Star domain had descended! Once the clone&#x2019;s domain came into contact with Leylin&#x2019;s it immediately shattered.</p><p>Witnessing the outcome, the expression on the clone was hideous while Leylin heaved a sigh of relief.</p><p>His previous prediction had been accurate indeed.</p><p>Of course, he could have stopped the old man, but he wouldn&#x2019;t have been able to deal with the Magus inside. Allowing both dangers to happen simultaneously and dealing with both issues at once was Leylin&#x2019;s preferred style.</p><p>After all, he did incur some hatred from the Sovereign King some time ago, and he naturally couldn&#x2019;t let the matter rest and allow the opposite party to develop their plans.</p><p>Even though this was just a projection of a clone, it wasn&#x2019;t wise to ignore him. He could have gone out to replenish himself well, and someday might even become an uncontrollable threat!</p><p>Leylin definitely wouldn&#x2019;t want that to happen, yet letting it go was also not an option. The best course of action then would be to destroy him completely when he was at his weakest.</p><p>&#x201C;You&#x2026;..&#x201D; Beelzebub&#x2019;s clone was a mess, with strands of hair standing on end, exhibiting his extreme anger.</p><p>&#x201C;Goodbye!&#x201D; Disregarding his opponent&#x2019;s rage, Leylin waved his hand. Terrifying energy condensed into his palm, forming a red flame that then morphed into a huge blazing serpent that coiled around him.</p><p>Under the terrifyingly high temperature, the original stone coffin immediately turned to ashes. Leylin eyed the blaze indifferently.</p><p>A black radiance appeared, gradually glowing as it sucked in all the fiery blaze. After the fire died out, Beelzebub could be seen opening his mouth wide and swallowing the flames.</p><p>What was even more bizarre was that after swallowing them, his aura seemed to have grown stronger.</p><p>&#x201C;Devouring capability! Your understanding of the power of gluttony has reached the level of laws!&#x201D; Leylin clapped without flinching. Based on the power of the opposite party&#x2019;s body, attaining this level was no big deal.</p><p>&#x201C;It&#x2019;s a pity, though. Your foundation is too weak. How much more energy can you absorb?&#x201D; Leylin&#x2019;s words angered Beelzebub so much that his face contorted in rage.</p><p>Any absorption of power would have a limit to it. And since the opposite party had no mass point belonging to the Morning Star, there was an obvious upper bound to it. Leylin focused on this point and attacked him mercilessly.</p><p>It was advantageous that the opposite party was currently weak. It wasn&#x2019;t likely that Leylin would have such opportunities in the future.</p><p>*Boom!* A torrential blaze, like a huge wave, swallowed Beelzebub. He became unsure, not daring to swallow any more. Uncountable black tentacles appeared on his body, wrapping him up.</p><p>Upon contact with the scarlet red flame, the black tentacles immediately started dissolving. Counteracting each other, the attacks from both sides gradually weakened.</p><p>&#x201C;Ivory Devourer!&#x201D;</p><p>Ferocious black teeth, that seemed to have melted in the void, surrounded Leylin. Yet, it was blocked by a red shield that had Giant Kemoyin Serpents carved on it.</p><p>&#x201C;Indeed, how many more attacks can you sustain?&#x201D;</p><p>The huge black teeth grazed across the surface of the shield, leaving deep grooves and creating big sparks. At this moment, Leylin&#x2019;s looked like he had a plan in mind.</p><p>&#x201C;You&#x2026;&#x201D; Bundled within the black tentacles, Beelzebub could only blurt out a single word and was soon enveloped by the fiery red blaze&#x2026;..</p><p>&#x201C;This&#x2026;.. What is happening?&#x201D;</p><p>The teen lying on the ground looked up and saw what looked like the aftermath of a big battle. At long last, the Magus with a head of black hair appeared and stood among the stars in the sky. He looked like a God descending onto the earth, moving the fiery red blaze to swallow up the strange creature in the coffin.</p><p>A long time later, the shimmering stars started to dim, and the black hair Magus came before the teen. His face looked tired but was filled with delight.</p><p>&#x201C;Your name is Blu?&#x201D; Securing the other gluttony imprint well, Leylin smiled.</p><p>Leylin obviously would not want to keep the consciousness of the opposite party. To deal with a rank 7 and above, one could be drowned in their layers of crafty schemes. Unwittingly, the radiation contamination would have become a handful, similar to the example of the old Magus and his ancestor.</p><p>However, these gluttony imprints were very much worth researching. And the laws themselves were of much importance!</p><p>The power of laws! It was like a door separating rank 6 and rank 7. Only after attaining the necessary power of laws could one be promoted to the Breaking Dawn realm and above. As such, Leylin showed no traces of politeness and kept the gluttony imprint to study thoroughly later.</p><p>Although at the present moment, his rank was considerably low, he would definitely come into contact with it in the near future.</p><p>&#x201C;Yes, Master. I am Blu!&#x201C;</p><p>The young Blu bowed respectfully to the Morning Star Magus. It was the kind of respect that the whole central continent would give to one!</p><p></p><hr><p></p>
