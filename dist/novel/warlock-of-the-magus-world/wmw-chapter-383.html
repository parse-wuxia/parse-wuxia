<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>A Fallen Empress</strong></span></p><p>The human camp was more complicated.</p><p>Many Magi, acolytes and even common soldiers had been gathered together like a mixed flock of birds.</p><p>It had turned out this way due to the lack of core leadership. The deaths of the Guardian of the Realm and the Protectors had left them without a stable chain of command. Hence, many problems arose, not the least of which was disputes in command. Many ambitious parties were working from the shadows, plotting their own schemes.</p><p>&#x201C;Oh? People are gossiping about me?&#x201D; Back at his own camp, Leylin was updated with the latest report, and his face revealed a mysterious sinister smile.</p><p>&#x201C;Don&#x2019;t bother with them. These rumours will be deemed baseless soon enough!&#x201D; Leylin waved his hand and flashed a faint smile.</p><p>Suddenly his face changed as he looked towards the northern skies, &#x201C;She&#x2019;s here!&#x201D;</p><p>A tiny black speck suddenly rose from the northern skies, bringing a huge and irresistible power to bear upon the two armies.</p><p>&#x201C;Your Majesty.&#x201D; Numerous elite Underground Winter Spider knights knelt down to salute with zeal in their eyes.</p><p>Anya looked up to face the human army, her beautiful face and body exuding a mysterious charm.</p><p>&#x201C;Where is your commander? I want to see him!&#x201D; she spoke with a sweet yet icy tone to her voice, as alluring as a rose in a bloody scene. It was tender and beautiful, yet dangerous and deadly.</p><p>And so that voice with the strength of a Magus was heard even on the side of the humans.</p><p>Numerous ordinary troops started fainting and dying, many of them shedding patches of hair and bleeding furiously.</p><p>This was the result of radiations emitted recklessly from a high ranking Magus&#x2019;s spell, causing the destruction of the normal human&#x2019;s body.</p><p>The acolytes too started to faint one after the other, until only official Magi could remain clear-headed, although even their fighting strength was heavily reduced.</p><p>Streams of green air could be seen, being drawn out from the human camp and transferred to Anya who was hovering in mid-air.</p><p>&#x201C;A false domain! There were rumours that the dark elven empress had attained such a high level&#x2014; the ability to suck life and power out of them is a formidable gift!&#x201D;</p><p>Leylin&#x2019;s expression showed signs of interest and he turned to look at the other high ranking Magi.</p><p>In the human camp, the rest of the high-ranking Magi were waiting in their tents in silence. Waves of spatial magic power permeated the air.</p><p>&#x201C;The battle has yet to begun, and you&#x2019;re already about to run away?&#x201D; Leylin laughed uncontrollably, but then felt that it was only right. After all, these Magi had thought that the empress of the dark elves had been severely injured. If not, the Guardian of the Realm would have survived as well.</p><p>What now?</p><p>&#x201C;At this moment, the Magi outside would mostly likely be vehemently cursing me, huh?&#x201D; Leylin shook his head, as his body floated to mid-air.</p><p>*Roar!* A massive, ferocious aura that seemed to emanate from a predator of ancient times burst forth.</p><p>A wave of violent air rolled and surged through, causing huge chaos to the opposite camp. The other Magi noticed that this wave of energy was not inferior to that of the dark elven empress!</p><p>&#x201C;Bloodline Skill&#x2014;Intimidating Gaze!&#x201D;</p><p>*Snap!* Leylin&#x2019;s life force rose ferociously, as if a chain or seal had been broken, and at that moment, he had crossed the category of a rank 2 Magus and entered a deep and unmeasurable realm.</p><p>This kind of change upset Anya, &#x201C;Rank 3! You have already advanced to rank 3! &#x201C;</p><p>Yes! Before the murder of the Guardian of the Realm, Leylin had secretly arranged for his advancement to a rank 3 Magus.</p><p>With the Giant Serpent&#x2019;s Breath potion and the usage of a large amount of top-notch resources, Leylin&#x2019;s spiritual force had turned bright silver long ago, and his power had been enhanced greatly.</p><p>As for the next level in Kemoyin&#x2019;s Pupil, Leylin already had it! In fact, with the A.I. chip&#x2019;s enhancement, it had become even more all-encompassing.</p><p>That in addition to the enlightenment from the Tree of Wisdom formed the perfect conditions to ensure success.</p><p>Leylin&#x2019;s intention was to elevate his power to be on the same level as the best of Twilight Zone, so that he would have the confidence to carry out his plans.</p><p>The breakthrough had surprised Leylin. His materialised spiritual force had been refined continuously and, at the same time, the foundations of the spiritual force crystal had been constructed. The swiftness and ease of it had left Leylin with an unfathomable feeling.</p><p>It could be the result from the use of the Giant Kemoyin Serpent&#x2019;s blood or from the accumulated knowledge from the A.I. Chip. It might be the great essence of wisdom found in the ancient tree that no one knew about. Or it could be the different factors all coming together that assisted Leylin in acquiring his current position. It had surely surpassed his own expectations.</p><p>The enhanced A.I.Chip thus refreshed Leylin&#x2019;s status.</p><p>[Leylin Farlier, Rank 3 Warlock. Bloodline: Giant Kemoyin Serpent, Power: 23.6, Agility: 20.1, Physique: 35.7, Vitality: 203.4, Magic Power: 203(Magic power is in synchronisation with spiritual force)]</p><p>[Host has obtained an innate spell upon advancement&#x2014; Intimidating Gaze!]</p><p>[Intimidating Gaze: After numerous blood purification, the Giant Kemoyin Serpent, as an elite ancient predator, has its might absorbed and assimilated into the bloodline Warlock. They who held the dignity of creatures from ancient times has a force field with an intimidating effect! Effect: any living being that is within the perimeter will have their powers suppressed. Those with weak willpower will enter a state of confusion. Rank 1 Magus will have their abilities weakened by 50%, rank 2 Magus weakened by 30% and Magi of the same rank will have their stats reduced by 10%!]</p><p>With such an ability to suppress the power of his enemies, Leylin seemed genuinely ready to dominate the field. In fact, he could be considered an ideal Magus to dominate everything!</p><p>Unlike the domain of a Morning Star Magus, which gave them complete control, Intimidating Gaze only applied certain effects to those caught within its area of effect.</p><p>With Leylin now using Intimidating Gaze, the Underground Winter Spider knights felt as if an eye from the depths of hell was gazing upon them, which caused them to collapse to the ground. As for the matriarchs, their faces turned ashen, warping with terror.</p><p>Leylin took a calculative look at the empress in front of him. Strictly speaking, this could be considered their first meeting.</p><p>His relentless gaze transcended the opposing party&#x2019;s demonic charm, instead, he paid more attention to the decorative design on her body.</p><p>A moment late, Leylin sighed and responded faintly: &#x201C;So&#x2026; You were already seriously injured!&#x201D;</p><p>The suppression of injuries by the branding of runes on the body, as well as the familiar scent, reminded Leylin of the Guardian of the Realm who had perished. The vicious fight with him and the Protectors had obviously caused Anya to suffer serious injuries, leaving her with no choice but to retreat.</p><p>Anya looked at the youthful Leylin, showing a bitter smile.</p><p>&#x201C;Do you know? Dark elves&#x2019; lives are filled with hardships. When I was young, every winter I would witness many dark elves firmly geared up with weaponry. My mother told me they were gearing up for war, and after the war, we would have enough food and provisions to survive&#x2026;&#x201D; Anya&#x2019;s face was filled with loss, her voice angelic. The corners of her eyes sparkled.</p><p>&#x201C;My mother told me that, far away on the southern side, there was a huge empire of the human race. It was continuously fighting with us for survival. Hence, every year we suffer huge losses and death. I&#x2019;d decided then that I would lead an army of dark elves and break this cruel cycle&#x2026;</p><p>&#x201C;But now, unfortunately, I am unable to do so&#x2026;&#x201D;</p><p>Anya turned to look at the dark elven camp one more time, and at this moment, an enormous uproar occurred. Several rank 2 matriarchs disregarded the frightening energy wave and stormed straight forward.</p><p>&#x201C;Can you promise me, that you will preserve the dark elven race?&#x201D; Anya lowered her once arrogant head, pleading.</p><p>Looking at the intelligent and well-respected empress of the dark elves in front of him, Leylin nodded his head lightly, &#x201C;I promise you that I will preserve the dark elves and see that they remain in Twilight Zone&#x2026;.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;However, what the other Magi do afterwards will be out of my hands. Moreover, whether the dark elves are able to survive within the ecology laboratory is also another unpredictable matter&#x2026;&#x2019; These words were left unsaid.</p><p>&#x201C;Thank you so much!&#x201D; Anya smiled, the crown on her head giving off a glaring ray of light.</p><p>The moment Leylin swung his hand, a huge golden Spider appeared and landed in the center of the field. It sat facing the Underground Winter Spiders across it and started hissing loudly.</p><p>The Underground Winter Spiders then became increasingly restless, and many of them started to show signs of instability. Some even turned against the dark elven knights riding them and started biting at them.</p><p>Aru, the Underground Winter Spider Emperor, had originally been sealed by Longbottom. Leylin had unsealed it after the events at the arena and subdued it for his own use.</p><p>To a certain extent, Aru might be the common ancestor of all Underground Winter Spiders, hence to have such unbelievable power for use by him, he was thrilled to possess this killer weapon.</p><p>&#x201C;Here we go!&#x201D;</p><p>Leylin exclaimed lightly, fine black scales appearing on his body and striking Anya&#x2019;s at the same time&#x2026;</p><p>Along with the loud hissing of both opposing spiders and the clash of the two Magi, the two opposing troops on the ground also started to assemble and started the attack in full force, the roar of their voices shaking the earth&#x2026;.</p><p>Twilight Zone, year 5782. Magus Leylin Farlier led the human army to crush the army of the dark elves along with their empress. Magus Anya, along with rank 1 and rank 2 matriarchs, were not spared. Together with the rest of the army, they collapsed at the scene and countless lives were lost.</p><p></p><hr><p></p>
