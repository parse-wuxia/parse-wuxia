<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>Taking Action</strong></span></p><p>&#x201C;Indeed! The inheritance of an official Magus is a sufficient reason for this fellowship to be broken!&#x201D;</p><p>Jayden spoke slowly.</p><p>&#x201C;Not only that!&#x201D; Now, the metal liquid covered Bosain&#x2019;s body and turned into a silver white armour.</p><p>&#x201C;If it was just a spell model, Grine Water or something of that sort, I wouldn&apos;t mind at all. But this is Norco Curadu Sfar&#x2019;s legacy!&#x201D;</p><p>Bosain&#x2019;s face became flushed.</p><p>&#x201C;We are talking about the great Magus Serholm! The inheritance of a rank 4 Morning Star Magus!&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;The great Magus Serholm?!&#x201D; Clarity appeared on Jayden&#x2019;s face. Of course, he had heard of the legend of this great Magus.</p><p>However, in the legends, the great Magus Serholm used an alternative title. Apart from Leylin who had an overpowered way to store data and Bosain who had a solid family foundation, there were many who weren&apos;t aware of this fact.</p><p>&#x201C;Since you know the reason, you can die in peace!&#x201D;</p><p>Bosain did not conceal the killing intent on his face as he viciously slashed the silver white sword down upon Jayden.</p><p>*Hua!* The longsword split into countless small silver needles that were sent flying towards Jayden.</p><p>&#x201D;Form a shield!&#x201D; Jayden shouted. More vines appeared from the badge and took the form of a large shield, in front of Jayden.</p><p>*Ding Ding Dang Dang!* Countless needles fell like rain onto his shield, creating many small holes.</p><p>The huge impact sent Jayden staggering backwards. His face became filled with despair.</p><p>&#x201C;Jayden! I know all of your tricks. Apart from your magic artifact what other trump cards do you have?&#x201D;</p><p>Bosain spoke these words to try and shatter Jayden&#x2019;s confidence.</p><p>Jayden retreated until his back hit a wall, then he turned his head and shouted to Leylin. &#x201C;Leylin! Let&apos;s act together! If not we will both die!&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Leylin! Don&apos;t believe him! If you can stay neutral and be on the sidelines, or even help me, I swear that you will obtain the friendship of the Lilytell family!&#x201D;</p><p>After listening to the persuasion of both sides, Leylin appeared panic-stricken; he staggered back two steps and spoke in a quivering voice. &#x201C;No! I don&apos;t want any inheritance anymore, just let me go&#x2026;.&#x201D;</p><p>After hearing those words, Jayden&#x2019;s face looked even more aghast and anxious. Even his vine shield had become smaller in size.</p><p>Bosain, on the other hand, laughed loudly. &#x201C;Haha&#x2026; My Lilytell family will definitely welcome a Potions Master like Leylin&#x2026;&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;As for you Jayden! You&apos;re finished!&#x201D;</p><p>The longsword in Bosain&#x2019;s hands split again and each droplet of liquid metal floated in the air, turning into dart-like objects.</p><p>&#x201C;With my blood....&#x201D;</p><p>After seeing the opponent&#x2019;s attack, hopelessness surfaced on Jayden&#x2019;s face. He used the same method as before and smeared his blood on the green badge.</p><p>In an instant, the green vine shield turned into a red giant one.</p><p>&#x201C;The energy in your badge should deplete soon huh? Even if you use your blood as a substitute how long can you last?!&#x201D;</p><p>Bosain shouted and sent countless needles flying towards Jayden.</p><p>*Bang!*</p><p>The red shield exploded and the innumerable needles pierced Jayden&#x2019;s body.</p><p>With countless holes present all over his body, Jayden was immediately dyed red. Regret and disbelief filled his face as he fell slowly to the ground.</p><p>&#x201C;Hu hu&#x2026;&#x201D; Bosain was panting somewhat loudly at this moment. He turned around and faced Leylin.</p><p>&#x201C;Well done! You did not attack me with him earlier!&#x201D; With a sinister smile, Bosain pointed at Jayden who laid within a pool of blood.</p><p>&#x201C;I, the heir to the Lilytell family, the pride of Abyssal Bone Forest Academy, the silver white swordsman Bosain will grant you your preferred choice of death!&#x201D;</p><p>As he spoke, a commiserating yet toying expression appeared on his face; he was like a lion or tiger who was playing with a rabbit.</p><p>&#x201C;Choice&#x2026; Way to die....&#x201D; Leylin squeezed out a smile, &#x201C;Mister Bosain, I don&apos;t quite understand you!&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;My meaning is extremely clear, you can only die here!&#x201D; Bosain&#x2019;s expression was cold, &#x201C;The inheritance of the great Magus Serholm is too important. I cannot allow the possibility of you leaking any information!&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Originally, as a genius in Potioneering, you had a bright future. What a pity&#x2026;&#x201D; Bosain looked at Leylin regretfully, as if feeling sorry for his plight.</p><p>&#x201C;Perhaps, you would like to end your own life &#x2026; It might reduce some of the pain&#x2026;&#x201D;</p><p>Bosain edged closer and closer to Leylin, his voice gentle yet enticing.</p><p>There seemed to be a magical force in his voice, luring Leylin to do things the way he said.</p><p>Leylin&#x2019;s eyes went blank, his lips unconsciously formed the following, &#x201C;I want to&#x2026;&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;It&apos;s going to be a success!&#x201D; exclaimed Bosain, gleefully.</p><p>At that moment, Leylin raised his head and grinned, revealing a pair of bright and shiny teeth, he said, &#x201C;I want you dead!&#x201D;</p><p>*Bang!*</p><p>A silver streak flew from Leylin&#x2019;s hand onto Bosain&#x2019;s face.</p><p>Shock filled Bosain&#x2019;s face, but a layer of liquid metal automatically formed a mask, protecting his face.</p><p>*Ka-Cha!* The silver light skid against the mask, emitting sparks.</p><p>&#x201C;A pity that it&#x2019;s a magic artifact with instantaneous defensive capabilities!&#x201D;</p><p>Leylin looked at Bosain who was retreating, his face showed a hint of regret and disappointment.</p><p>&#x201C;You&#x2026; You were pretending earlier!&#x201D; Bosain touched his face which had already swollen, and his expression began to contort.</p><p>&#x201C;Such a boring illusory spell! I was not afraid of it when I was a level 2 acolyte!&#x201D;</p><p>Leylin smiled brightly, &#x201C;This look suits you very well! Like a pig head!&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;You&#x2019;re seeking death!&#x201D;</p><p>Bosain&#x2019;s face was flushed from anger; the liquid metal crept and covered his whole body, forming a silver armour.</p><p>His eyes were a little bloodshot as he brandished his longsword and charged towards Leylin.</p><p>&#x201C;I want to pluck each and every tendon from your body, you useless trash who only knows Potioneering!&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Oh really?&#x201D;</p><p>Leylin frowned. A black longbow appeared in his hands and a frost arrow was shot.</p><p>*Sssii!* Bosain did not dodge nor hide, letting the arrow land on his body.</p><p>The frost arrow was blocked by the silver armour and turned into a white mist that covered the surface of Bosain&#x2019;s armour.</p><p>Suffering from its effect, Bosain&#x2019;s speed had lowered somewhat.</p><p>&#x201C;I have been watching you all along &#x2014; all the potions in your bag should have been fully used up, am I right?&#x201D; Bosain smiled maliciously, directly rushing at Leylin.</p><p>&#x201C;An accurate guess!&#x201D;</p><p>Leylin&#x2019;s smile did not waver, which suddenly made Bosain feel a bad premonition.</p><p>&#x201C;It is unfortunate, but my trump card is not related to potions!&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Fallen Star Pendant! Activate!&#x201D;</p><p>Along with Leylin&#x2019;s command, a layer of silver-grey light radiated from his body.</p><p>This layer seemed like starlight, dim but sturdy and unwavering. It covered Leylin&#x2019;s body forming a silver-grey armour all over him. On the surface of this armour, a few gems were flickering.</p><p>*Bang!*</p><p>Bosain struck with his longsword, but he was blocked directly and grabbed by Leylin&#x2019;s right hand, which was covered by the armour. Following which, Leylin viciously punched Bosain&#x2019;s face!</p><p>*Ka-Cha!*</p><p>The mask on Bosain&#x2019;s face dented inwards and he immediately spat out several teeth as he flew backwards with a look of disbelief on his face.</p><p>&#x201C;As expected using fists to hit someone feels the best!&#x201D;</p><p>Leylin narrows his eyes and spoke with some satisfaction.</p><p>*Hua La La!* Bosain crashed into a few empty bookshelves and they toppled over him. Numerous decomposing wooden boards buried Bosain within the rubble.</p><p>*Bang!* The wooden boards were blasted away. Once again Bosain stood before Leylin with his bright silver armour.</p><p>&#x201C;I have underestimated you! A defensive type magic artifact! You are actually the one amongst us with the most secrets!&#x201D;</p><p>Bosain&#x2019;s face now was extremely solemn. However, with two swollen lumps on both sides of his face, Leylin felt like laughing when he saw him.</p><p>&#x201C;Too much nonsensical stuff has been said!&#x201D;</p><p>Leylin&#x2019;s muscles bulged and he clashed with Bosain.</p><p>*Bang!* *Bang!* *Bang!*</p><p>Booming noises sounded from the study room, sending dust flying everywhere. Through the barely visible dust screen, two humanoid creatures wearing armour could be seen charging at each other.</p><p>These two creatures seemed not to be afraid of injuries. They only used the most brutal and barbaric fighting style &#x2014; completely forsaking their defence, each one simply attacked his opponent.</p><p>Bookshelves collapsed continuously and chaos ensued.</p><p>If not for the two creatures deliberately avoiding the middle study-table containing the remnants, it, too, would have shared the fate of those bookshelves.</p><p>With the seconds turning into minutes, it could be seen that the human figure &#x2014; the one with the bright silver armour &#x2014; seemed to be at a disadvantage. The white light on it, too, had somewhat dimmed.</p><p>Finally, with a punch from the person armoured a silver-grey, the bright silver armour broke, turning back into its liquid metal form, and then it was restored to its original ball-shaped form.</p><p>Leylin once again stomped on Bosain who was on the floor.</p><p>*Crack!*, the sound of breaking bones could be heard from Bosain&#x2019;s chest.</p><p>After which, a shoe coated in silver-grey light nonchalantly stepped on his chest.</p><p>One corner of Bosain&#x2019;s lips was overflowing with blood, &#x201C;I regret this! If only my scroll was still here, if only I didn&#x2019;t use &#x2018;silver light&#x2019; so many times earlier!&#x201D;</p><p>*Ka-Cha!*</p><p>Leylin&#x2019;s eyes were devoid of emotion. He showed no quarter towards Bosain and withdrew a dagger from his robes and severed all 4 of Bosain&#x2019;s limbs.</p><p>&#x201C;Arghh&#x2026;.&#x201D;</p><p>Bosain&#x2019;s facial muscles contorted, and cries of anguish reverberated in the whole study room.</p><p>Leylin kicked the severed limbs away and took out a hemostasis potion, after which he took out a hemostasis potion and poured it on Bosain&#x2019;s wound &#x2014; he wasn&#x2019;t going to let Bosain bleed to death.</p><p>&#x201C;You...Just kill me!&#x201D; Bosain&#x2019;s face was extremely pale as he forced the words out from his mouth.</p><p>&#x201C;How could I have the audacity to kill a member of the mighty Lilytell family?&#x201D;</p><p>Leylin smiled slightly, yet to Bosain, it seemed to be a very sinister and sadistic smile.</p><p>&#x201C;As the heir of a Magus family, you would definitely have some tracking spell cast on you by an official Magus. It is very likely that once I killed you, that official Magus would be able to sense it!&#x201D;</p><p>Leylin spoke slowly. At the same time, Bosain&#x2019;s expression turned completely ashen.</p><p></p><hr><p></p>
