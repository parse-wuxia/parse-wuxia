<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>Coin Of Destiny</strong></span></p><p>&#x201C;Darkness? What darkness? Hasn&#x2019;t Longbottom&#x2019;s scheme been thwarted?&#x201D; Baelin was doubtful, but he no longer had the time to think. He scooped Aaron up in a hurry, preparing to treat him.</p><p>Strands of green rays emerged from Baelin&#x2019;s fingers, and merged with the horrifying wound on Aaron&#x2019;s body, helping him stop the bleeding and mending his tissues.</p><p>&#x201C;Aaron, Aaron! Are you alright? Hang in there!&#x201D; Baelin constantly cried out, large amounts of tears spilling from his eyes.</p><p>&#x201C;Longbottom! Lord Longbottom is dead!&#x201D; At this time, in the middle of the competition venue, the revolutionary army and dark elves who had just lost their leader all fell into a state of chaos.</p><p>*Cough Cough!* Aaron coughed violently and opened his eyes. &#x201C;I&#x2026; I&#x2019;m still alive?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Of course, you&#x2019;re my prophet. How can you die without my permission?&#x201D; Baelin covertly brushed away his tears and laughed.</p><p>&#x201D;Oh no!&#x201D; Aaron suddenly started to struggle.</p><p>&#x201D;What&#x2019;s happening?&#x201D; Baelin hurriedly helped him stand up.</p><p>&#x201C;Danger is still near! In fact, it&#x2019;s in our immediate vicinity!&#x201D; Aaron&#x2019;s face showed increasing terror, &#x201C;He&#x2026; He is&#x2026;&#x201D;</p><p>*Bang! Bang! Bang!*</p><p>A person wearing an exquisite black robe emerged amidst sudden applause. Every move of his held an inexplicable aura of authority and grace, and he slowly entered their field of vision.</p><p>&#x201C;As expected of a Magus practicing Sacred Flame. Once you reach rank 2, even I cannot escape your prophecies!&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Master Leylin! Weren&#x2019;t you&#x2026;&#x201D; Baelin looked at Leylin. At first, he felt joy, but then he noticed the nine statues erected in the center.</p><p>&#x201C;A mere Ice Seal of Eternity, what can it do to me?&#x201D; Leylin laughed casually, not revealing that he had known about Longbottom&#x2019;s plan from Ernis. Even if he hadn&#x2019;t known, though, his frightening power and affinity with frost would have let him escape quite easily.</p><p>*Bang!* As though to verify Leylin&#x2019;s words, one of the nine ice sculptures suddenly exploded, revealing the silhouette of a puppet which quickly dissipated.</p><p>&#x201C;What&#x2026; What&#x2019;s happening? Ah! Haha&#x2026; Haha... I get it! Master Leylin, this is just a prank, isn&#x2019;t it?&#x201D; Baelin laughed forcefully, but the unease in his heart had reached its peak.</p><p>&#x201C;Prank? Oh! Yes, I love cracking jokes with you, just not today. I was just excited by your performance and wanted to excuse myself!&#x201D; Leylin snapped his finger.</p><p>*Swish! Swish! Swish! Swish!* Light flashed everywhere, and a large number of Nature&#x2019;s Alliance Magi appeared. Some came out from beneath the stages, some from behind the seats, and some just materialised from the shadows.</p><p>These Magi all had their concentration and powers intact, and embarked on a ruthless massacre the moment they entered. The dark elves and Twilight Zone Magi all fell at their hands, and were swept in a matter of seconds.</p><p>&#x201C;Second level seal enhancement begin!&#x201D; The leader, Iren, immediately tossed out a scroll.</p><p>*Bzzzt Bzzzt!* A frightful wave of energy dispersed, and an even larger fleet of Magi appeared at the center of the competition venue, reinforcing the gigantic spider cocoon.</p><p>&#x201C;Lord Leylin? Why?&#x201D; Baelin kept retreating, looking as though he was on the verge of breaking down.</p><p>&#x201C;You are one of the higher-ups in Twilight Zone, and also someone I look up to. Why...&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;No particular reason, after directing a play for so long, it&#x2019;s time I came to wrap things up!&#x201D; The corners of Leylin&#x2019;s mouth turned into a sinister smirk.</p><p>&#x201C;Play? What kind of play?&#x201D; Baelin did not dare to think further.</p><p>&#x201C;A comedy about a silly hero, and a group of foolish Magi!&#x201D; Leylin smiled subtly, and pointed at Baelin&#x2019;s neck.</p><p>Boiling hot! Scalding hot! Baelin felt an unnerving heat exuding from his neck, penetrating through his armor, roasting his skin and muscles.</p><p>*Boom!* A streak of gold light emitted from his neck and returned to Leylin&#x2019;s palms.</p><p>It was a peculiar gold coin, one face of which had a lucky bird and the other a skull. The sides of the coin also had elaborate patterns and prints on them.</p><p>&#x201C;This was the gold coin you gave me, was it all planned from the very beginning?&#x201D; Baelin laughed pathetically.</p><p>&#x201C;No! I did not have such plans back in Potter Town, but on the way to the Eastern Capital, I found out that you were the Child of Destiny, so I decided to do this!&#x201D; Leylin looked at the gold coin in his hand, excitement written on his face.</p><p>&#x201C;Hehe&#x2026;.. You are all liars! Liars!&#x201D; Baelin laughed hysterically. Rays of silver light burst forth from his body, and he charged forth, Meteor Sword in hand.</p><p>*Pow!* A fist of immense strength landed firmly on his cheek, causing the Meteor Sword to be swung out of his grasp even as he was sent flying.</p><p>Alas, the Bio Boosting armour on his body failed to hold any longer and disintegrated midair.</p><p>&#x201C;Your destiny was to become the victor of this revolution in your battle with Longbottom! And after Longbottom was taken care of, how do I put it&#x2026; You are no longer of use to destiny. And without destiny on your side, you are but a dead dog to me...&#x201D; Leylin ruthlessly attacked Baelin.</p><p>It was the truth. Before Baelin completed his mission, were Leylin to have made a move, he had a premonition that something would inexplicably block his path. But now? There was nothing that could stop him.</p><p>This was the very reason why many accomplished heroes never got another chance to take risks and could only choose to live in seclusion among the commoners..</p><p>&#x201C;Coin of Destiny, step one accomplished!&#x201D; Leylin turned around and looked over at where Aaron was.</p><p>*Pew!* At this moment, a stream of light also emitted from Aaron&#x2019;s ring, and in front of him appeared the Great Magus Merlin.</p><p>&#x201C;Little Aaron, what did you promise me then?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;I promised that other than collecting your shards, I&#x2019;ll have to help you complete another task!&#x201D; Aaron&#x2019;s expression was a mix of terror, alarm, and agony.</p><p>&#x201C;Now, I request of you, to return to me the Sacred Flame!&#x201D; Merlin&#x2019;s voice was extremely calm, but Aaron couldn&#x2019;t help but turn pale at his voice. &#x201C;Grandpa Merlin, I&#x2019;ve always been respectful to you as though you were my own grandfather...&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;But, the moment you advanced to the second rank, you realised it, no?&#x201D; Merlin&#x2019;s illusion transformed continuously before settling on the image of Leylin.</p><p>&#x201C;So all of this; me gaining the inheritance, practicing Sacred Flame, meeting with Vinas; it was all your doing?&#x201D;</p><p>Aaron turned around and looked at Leylin, his pupils pitch black.</p><p>&#x201C;At first it was, but the melodrama at the end was something I couldn&#x2019;t predict either. It looks like the stability issues with Sacred Flame still have to be solved!&#x201D; Leylin&#x2019;s voice was extremely cold, &#x201C;Now, hand it over!&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;AH!&#x201D; As soon as Leylin voice sounded, Aaron felt as though his consciousness was split open by someone who wanted to extract something.</p><p>The extreme horrifying pain caused him to roll around, and his face contorted into demon-like expressions.</p><p>Shortly after, Aaron felt the spiritual force he had so painstakingly cultivated with the Sacred Flame was drawn out from him entirely.</p><p>Strands of silver spiritual force formed a vortex in midair, and Aaron who lost his meditation technique had his powers depleted progressively, from rank 2 to rank 1 before hitting rock bottom&#x2014;an acolyte.</p><p>&#x201C;The spiritual force of Sacred Flame!&#x201D; Leylin&#x2019;s smile broadened. He sang with excitement, &#x201C;Along with the sacrifice of a Child of Destiny!&#x201D;</p><p>With his deep voice sounding, the surface of the Coin of Destiny shone with a thin layer of light and was lifted into the air.</p><p>&#x201C;With the magnanimous power of destiny, along with the foundation and spiritual force of the Sacred Flame that split apart and then merged together!&#x201D;</p><p>Leylin pulled out a crystal already full of golden liquid, and threw it into the spiritual force vortex.</p><p>All of a sudden, a surge of silver white flames emerged from within.</p><p>&#x201C;There are still three broken and unwilling souls!&#x201D; Leylin&#x2019;s smile became even wider, and two items flew out from Aaron&#x2019;s body.</p><p>They were a worn-out notebook and a five-colored necklace. At this moment, an illusion flickered on each of the two items.</p><p>&#x201C;Vinas! Vinas!&#x201D; Aaron struggled as he saw the face of his lover on the five-colored necklace, however, Vinas&#x2019; expression was ever-changing, from tenderness, to detachment, to distraught&#x2026;</p><p>&#x201C;You can join too!&#x201D; Leylin pointed at Aaron&#x2019;s forehead and it exploded like a watermelon. The black ring in his hand also flew into the air, joining into a triangular formation with the other two items.</p><p>&#x201C;With great power from the fragmented souls as the main body, the Sacred Flame meditation technique as the core, and finally injecting a large amount of the power of destiny...&#x201D;</p><p>Leylin&#x2019;s voice grew in fervency.</p><p>Following the chanting, the triangular formation and meditative vortex grew closer, giving off small explosions.</p><p>&#x201C;AHHHHHHH&#x2026;&#x2026;&#x201D; Baelin hissed violently and charged forth once again, but before he got close, he was already thrown out by the airwaves.</p><p>&#x201C;Seal!&#x201D; A complex and awkward-sounding ancient incantation finally fused into two short seals.</p><p>*Boom Boom!* A gigantic vortex formed, compressing the vortex and triangular formation into the Coin of Destiny like a funnel.</p><p>When everything ended, flashes of light appeared on the Coin of Destiny, yet it seemed as though nothing had changed.</p><p>&#x201C;Beautiful, isn&#x2019;t it?&#x201D;</p><p>Leylin let the gold coin float in midair and with a wave of his arm, the Meteor Sword voluntarily flew into his hands.</p><p>&#x201C;You did all this, just for those two items?&#x201D;</p><p>Baelin was beyond miserable, his eyes with a tint alike to flames.</p><p></p><hr><p></p>
