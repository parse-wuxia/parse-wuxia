<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>Bodach</strong></span></p><p>The place Leylin had chosen was significant. It was where he&#x2019;d first met the one-eyed owl, what he now suspected was a clone of the Nightmare King. The owl was the one who&#x2019;d given him his dream feather, making his lab connect to Dreamscape.</p><p>It was also at this place that he&#x2019;d discovered Gillian, a native of Dreamscape. That time had given him precious research materials, allowing him to increase his understanding of dreamforce.</p><p>The many Lords of Calamity stayed to the north of this place, at least five to six of these sovereigns of Dreamscape there at the minimum. Normally they would radiate their powers unconsciously, bringing disaster upon the natives. It made the place a forbidden ground for them.</p><p>But now, it was different. Dreamforce had weakened, and the area around these existences was the only place they could survive. After all, the reason that was the place the Lords of Calamity chose was that it would resist the weakening of dreamforce.</p><p>Compared to total annihilation, a blizzard, radiation, or any other calamities were a joke. This was why, in a critical period, it had made sense for Gillian&#x2019;s tribe to move north. Those evil sovereigns ignored their kind like they were ants anyway.</p><p>&#x201C;Is this the wondrous nature of life?&#x201D; Leylin exclaimed. He could sense that the north contained the most life in all of Dreamscape.</p><p>There seemed to be a strange parasitic ecosystem of the inhabitants there, where the natives sought shelter behind the Lords who resisted the weakening of the dreamforce. There were many tribes there like Gillian&#x2019;s.</p><p>&#x2018;This should make for a good investigation. Hmm?&#x2019; Leylin stopped in midair, as he scanned the gigantic dark figure with the A.I. Chip, and recalled that familiar aura.</p><p>&#x201C;I finally meet someone I recognise?&#x201D; Leylin smiled, &#x201C;Let&#x2019;s go greet him!&#x201D;</p><p>*Rumble!* Leylin had grown used to his powers as a rank 7. With the addition of Dreamscape Origin Force, he could exert earth-shattering power.</p><p>&#x201C;Break!&#x201D; Leylin willed the very earth to split apart, revealing a bottomless abyss. Even this was with him restraining himself, not using the power of the origin force. Had he done so, a small part of the continent would have been split apart easily.</p><p>&#x201C;Transform mud to rocks! And earth to metal!&#x201D; Magi of laws were close to the source of magic. There was nothing unnatural about these effects, especially given Leylin&#x2019;s study of the World of Gods.</p><p>Under his control bloodline energy fused with dreamforce, forming spells that seemed to be from both Magi and gods. Leylin was just like the gods who could perform magic with just a word, changing reality as the ground he&#x2019;d split open had turned into a huge steel plate.</p><p>*Boom!* A fast-moving black figure crashed into it underground, denting it even as an earth-shattering sound rumbled out.</p><p>&#x201C;Damn it! Why is there a steel plank here? No, is this a layer of the ground made of metal?&#x201D; The surface of the earth was clawed open by two large dragon claws, and a tremendous dragon poked its head through like a dejected groundhog.</p><p>Unlike the dragons of the World of Gods this one only had a large yellow eyeball, two thorny barbs like mountains on its back. Its large meaty wings that could cover the skies were currently curled up, streamlining its body while kept at its side. It was very suitable for digging underground.</p><p>Even more terrifyingly, the body of this dragon emitted terrifying energy undulations like those of Magi of laws. It showed the being&#x2019;s power. In the World of Gods, perhaps only the legendary Platinum Dragon could compare to it.</p><p>&#x201C;Long time no see, Mister one-eyed dragon from the Ultron World!&#x201D; Seeing the one-eyed dragon who&#x2019;d changed his profession to excavation, Leylin did his best to stifle his laughter as he greeted him politely.</p><p>&#x201C;Hm? Who dares make fun of the mighty Gigakell dragon race?&#x201D; The dragon patted his head with his huge claws, seeming to recover from his stupor, &#x201C;And here I was, thinking that it shouldn&#x2019;t be possible for me to miss something happening straight ahead. So it&#x2019;s that Magus from before!&#x201D;</p><p>While mumbling and complaining to himself, he pulled his large body out of the ground. &#x201C;It&#x2019;s been a few thousand years since we last met, but you&#x2019;ve already completely entered rank 7. Such talent leaves me envious&#x2026; But then again, this is Dreamscape. Who knows how many years have passed outside? It might have been tens of thousands of years that just slipped through my fingers&#x2026;&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Does that mean you&#x2019;ve been staying in Dreamscape all this time, my Lord?&#x201D; Leylin asked in surprise.</p><p>&#x201C;Of course! Don&#x2019;t you know how plentiful the treasures in Dreamscape are? Especially at the core&#x2026; the lustre of the pure suolo gems&#x2026;. Ah, those are ten thousand times more beautiful than the Mother Dragon&#x2019;s eyes&#x2026; If not for that damned Lord of Calamity stopping me then, I would have&#x2026; pooh!&#x201D;</p><p>The one-eyed dragon seemed to notice that he had accidentally revealed something and used claws to cover his mouth.</p><p>&#x201C;I see!&#x201D; Leylin nodded, while scorning him inside. The greedy nature of dragons was something that would never change even in the vastness of the astral plane. Be the dragons in the World of Gods or the Magus World, they all seemed to have a similar characteristic.</p><p>&#x201C;But&#x2014; please forgive me for my bluntness&#x2014; but you seem to be in need of help&#x2026;&#x201D; Leylin focused on this body that was as large as a mountain. A number of purple eyes were stuck to the dragon&#x2019;s thick horns and scales, looking rather disgusting.</p><p>Streaks of deep wounds appeared next to these purple eyes, constantly healing and tearing apart. Just the sight could almost cause one to feel the great pain.</p><p>&#x2018;Taking into account all that he said, could it be that he coveted some Lord of Calamity&#x2019;s treasure and was unlucky enough to be caught, thus leaving him in this state? He has no choice but to keep escaping&#x2026;&#x2019; Leylin thought inside, but his hands did not stop moving. A light green layer of clouds covered the body of the one-eyed dragon, tiny droplets of water dripping down.</p><p>The one-eyed Dragon observed Leylin warily with his yellow eyes as the green mist arrived, sniffing with his long snout. That seemed to leave him satisfied, and he did not shy away.</p><p>*Pss Pss!* The green rainwater made contact with the wounds, creating large amounts of corrosive white gas. However, the wounds that healed no longer ripped apart, allowing the dragon to snort comfortably.</p><p>&#x201C;There are two types of injuries on your body. The most terrifying is the curse of the purple eyes, which I&#x2019;m unable to remove for now. However, I can remove the accompanying effects of eternal clawing injuries&#x2026;&#x201D; Leylin looked satisfied.</p><p>When it came to healing injuries made by dreamforce, this was a very rare opportunity for him during his travels in Dreamscape. Besides, it was not so easy to get a guinea pig with the strength of a rank 7 Magus, as well as the chance to sense the strength of a Lord of Calamity so closely.</p><p>&#x201C;Plague, calamity, curse&#x2026;&#x201D; However, being so close, the power of calamity he could sense from the purple eyes caused Leylin&#x2019;s expression to change. This was formed practically out of the most evil powers of law, which even he was frightened by.</p><p>&#x201C;As expected of a Lord of Calamity. This ability perhaps surpasses the limits of rank 7&#x2026;&#x201D; Leylin sized the one-eyed Dragon in front of him up and down. Just the fact that the dragon could survive with his life while being pursued by such a terrifying character was more than enough for Leylin to think highly of him.</p><p>&#x201C;Haha&#x2026; thank you, Magus who possesses the abilities of healing. I feel much better now!&#x201D; The dragon happily stretched out his bodies, yellow eyes reflecting Leylin&#x2019;s figure. &#x201C;You are a good Magus, worthy of the friendship of the Gigakell Dragons!&#x201D;</p><p>The tremendous one-eyed dragon sniffed at Leylin, &#x201C;My real name is Bodach Avdizlok Ultron. I swear on my truename that I shall make a contract with you. As long as you or your blood summon this name for help, I of the one-eyed dragon clan shall give you power. Of course, you&#x2019;ll need to hand over a something of equal value as payment&#x2026;&#x201D;</p><p>As an existence of laws, there was no need to doubt his vows. However, seeing the sly look on the dragon&#x2019;s face, Leylin was speechless.</p><p>&#x2018;Are you trying to bully me because I&#x2019;ve never been to the World of Gods and don&#x2019;t know about the &#x2018;Dragon Tribe&#x2019;s Contract of Alliance&#x2019;?&#x2019; Leylin ridiculed him inside. The &#x2018;Dragon Tribe&#x2019;s Contract of Alliance&#x2019; in the World of Gods was said to be the contract with the least limitations. As long as enough gold kronas were paid up, a whole pile of demigod dragons could be called up. Of course, the cost was so high even Waukeen&#x2019;s church would go bankrupt.</p><p>The one-eyed dragon Bodach&#x2019;s contract was the same. While this looked to be a contract for summoning at any time as thanks towards Leylin, the rewards he&#x2019;d want would be enough for anyone to cough up blood.</p><p>Leylin had a strong suspicion that the dragon had given all his friends the same contract, in order to amass his wealth.</p><p>&#x201C;Forget it. I&#x2019;m not going to use it anyway&#x2026;&#x201D; Leylin rolled his eyes inside, and then looked at Bodach.</p><p>&#x201C;Thank you for your goodwill, but I think it&#x2019;s better if we discuss the curse on you now&#x2026;&#x201D; With Leylin&#x2019;s experience, the speed at which his attitude changed caused even the dragon to be astonished, &#x201C;Unless it&#x2019;s the spellcaster themselves, it&#x2019;s very difficult to remove it. On top of that, with the passage of time, it could cause even more horrifying harm to you&#x2026;&#x201D;</p><p>While Leylin was certain that he could remove it with a few years of research, especially given the Nightmare Absorbing Physique, he decided to hide this.</p><p></p><hr><p></p>
