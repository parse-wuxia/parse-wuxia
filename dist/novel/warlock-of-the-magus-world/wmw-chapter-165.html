<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>Crimson Palm</strong></span></p><p></p><p>&#x201C;Go!&#x201D;</p><p>With the command, the Magus enshrouded in green mist acted first.</p><p>After an incantation, he floated in the air, green mist continuously emanating from his body.</p><p>*Whoosh!* All of the dark green fog turned into a hurricane and struck at a part of the division in Leylin&#x2019;s field of vision.</p><p>*Sssii!* This green fog seemed to have extremely acidic properties.</p><p>Several acolytes wailed as they turned into white bones after the fog engulfed them. Even the surrounding ground turned even softer and muddier, turning into a marsh.</p><p>Even the light from part of the defensive spell formation trembled under the corrosive power of the green fog, as if it was going to shatter at any moment.</p><p>&#x201C;Who is it? You actually dare to attack a division of the Ennea Ivory Ring Tower?&#x201D;</p><p>An enraged voice sounded out. Following which, a figure wearing black armour flew up into the air.</p><p>&#x201C;Kill!&#x201D; The black clothed figure coldly shouted, and smoke billowed from the ground, turning into a skull as it struck the green fog.</p><p>&#x201C;Hehehe&#x2026;&#x201D; The Magus in the green fog cackled. Under his command, the green fog took on the form of a scorpion as it clashed with the skull.</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>*Bang!*</p><p>The surroundings seemed to have been struck by 10 different hurricane force winds, which then dissipated in all directions.</p><p>The mighty destructive power immediately caused the division&#x2019;s building to be shaven off by a layer.</p><p>&#x201C;Is this the might of a Magus who has fulfilled the requirements for breaking through to the next rank?&#x201D; Leylin watched the actions of the Magus in mid-air closely, a strange light in his eyes.</p><p>With the Magus in the green mist taking control, the battle in the air became increasingly one-sided.</p><p>&#x201C;It&#x2019;s our turn now!&#x201D; Rodent, who was half the size of a regular man, licked his lips.</p><p>&#x201C;Newbie! Don&#x2019;t get intimidated! If you hinder this operation, I&#x2019;ll be the first to claim your life!&#x201D;</p><p>Venom Snake threatened him.</p><p>&#x201C;If you obstruct me, you&#x2019;ll definitely be the one dead!&#x201D;</p><p>Leylin, who was going by the name of Blood Rogue, made a sound as he snickered. A potion exploded and formed a red membrane on his body.</p><p>&#x201C;Giant&#x2019;s green fog is an extremely powerful type of area of effect spell. It can deal devastating damage to all targets within the area of effect!&#x201D;</p><p>The old witch who was wearing the mask explained to Leylin.</p><p>&#x201C;Be careful; although Giant has lured the strongest enemy away, the remaining enforcers won&#x2019;t be easy to deal with either...&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Hehe&#x2026; Those light Magi are like little rabbits. I&#x2019;ve long since wanted to rip open their chests and savour the taste of their innards&#x2026;&#x201D;</p><p>A zombie-like dark Magus licked his lips as he turned into a gust of black wind, charging into the division&#x2019;s building, whose defensive spell formation had broken down.</p><p>*Whoosh!*</p><p>As if his action signalled the start, dozens of strange colours with powerful energy waves radiating from them charged towards the division.</p><p>&#x201C;Crap! It&#x2019;s a trap, inform the team leader quickly!&#x201D;</p><p>The light Magi who were by the entrance watched the dozens of dark Magi dashing towards them, and their expressions immediately changed. Even their voices cracked.</p><p>&#x201C;Haha&#x2026; Boss Giant may have some difficulty killing your leader, but it&#x2019;s not a problem for him to stall for time! Even if your leader finds something wrong, it&#x2019;ll be too late for him to save you&#x2026;&#x201D;</p><p>The old witch laughed loudly as she tossed two silver coloured metal balls towards the building.</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>The silver metal balls both exploded like grenades. After the shock waves had dissipated, a spell continuously encircled the area and the air was contorted, even to the point that the energy particles in the air were unstable.</p><p>*Bzzt bzzt* The sound of electromagnetic interference boomed throughout the area.</p><p>&#x201C;Not good! It&#x2019;s an Elemental Fluctuation Bomb! They actually have something like that!&#x201D;</p><p>The light Magi&#x2019;s faces were ashen as they quickly retreated.</p><p>&#x201C;Alright! None of the communication spells work, and space magic is now impossible to use. Comrades enjoy this blood fest! You only have a limit of 5 minutes&#x2026;&#x201D;</p><p>The old witch waved her hand.</p><p>&#x201C;Spirit Explosion!&#x201D;</p><p>*Boom!* A translucent spirit suddenly appeared in the surroundings of the light Magi and exploded.</p><p>Against the energy waves that targeted the spirit, one light Magus retreated several steps. Blood began to flow from his seven facial orifices.</p><p>However, in the instant that he retreated, a translucent worm appeared from the contortions in the air, directly charging towards the light Magus.</p><p>*Ka-Cha!* A defensive lightning shield appeared around the light Magus&#x2019; body, protecting him within.</p><p>*Pu!* The lightning shield crumpled like paper in the face of the worm, shattering from just the first touch. The crystal like worm drove its way right into the Magus&#x2019; mouth.</p><p>&#x201C;Ugh&#x2026;&#x201D; The light Magus&#x2019; face turned purple, looking like an eggplant as he clutched at his throat and collapsed.</p><p>&#x201C;Hehe, I don&#x2019;t usually have the luxury of using magic as I please and collecting souls! Same rules, all spirits collected in battles must be handed over to me. I guarantee a good price!&#x201D;</p><p>Silver light permeated the old witch&#x2019;s hands as she retrieved a crystal ball from her robes and approached the light Magus, who had lost all signs of resistance. Her lips moved non-stop as she chanted something.</p><p>Following her incantation, the light Magus&#x2019; eyes became blurry, and an indistinct human figure was pulled out from that Magus&#x2019; body.</p><p>&#x201C;This old witch is really a lunatic! She&#x2019;s actually collecting spirits directly from the battlefield!&#x201D;</p><p>Leylin watched her work, unperturbed by her surroundings, and suddenly began to regret his initial decision.</p><p>However, it was just for a moment that he shot a glance in the direction of the old witch. Immediately after, he spilled some red powder onto his two hands.</p><p>&#x201C;Crimson Palm!&#x201D;</p><p>As he chanted, a layer of crimson coloured light suffused both of Leylin&#x2019;s arms. His palms turned extremely slender, and his fingernails turned razor sharp and also slightly transparent.</p><p>This was a rank 1 spell from the Book of Giant Serpent that Leylin had long since recorded into his memory through the A.I. Chip.</p><p>Although his rank 1 spell&#x2019;s might was a little lower, with only a degree of 20 or so, with the addition of his elemental essence conversion, it was enough to deal with a normal rank 1 Magus.</p><p>Right now, Leylin was hiding his identity, so innate gifts and spells that were eye catching could not be used.</p><p>However, he had already prepared another set of spells to cast in times like this.</p><p>[Host&#x2019;s palms have had a slight adjustment in strength. Strength in arms are now stronger, with an added effect of poison!] The A.I. Chip&#x2019;s voice intoned.</p><p>Looking at the surroundings, where every Magus had found his or her own opponent, Leylin smiled as he casually picked on a light Magus who came charging at him.</p><p>*Crash!*</p><p>The slender, yet extremely menacing fingers clawed through the void, and large energy waves surged through the air as if the surface of a lake had been ripped through.</p><p>Leylin&#x2019;s body flashed as his red shadow rapidly moved around on the battlefield, leaving behind only a series of mirages.</p><p>&#x201C;Who exactly are you guys? Which organisation are you from?&#x201D;</p><p>The opponent that Leylin chose was a middle-aged man wearing loose white robes, yet an extremely aged voice came from his larynx.</p><p>Leylin only clawed viciously as a reply.</p><p>*Thump!*</p><p>Leylin struck with his right hand, directly slashing a few marks onto the opposing Magus&#x2019; body.</p><p>In front of Leylin&#x2019;s Crimson Palm, the official Magus&#x2019; standard white robes were like paper, getting slashed into pieces, and leaving behind a large hole.</p><p>&#x201C;Elemental Shield!&#x201D; The middle-aged Magus roared.</p><p>Brown energy particles gathered unceasingly and solidified to form a thin, yellow, full-body armour, protecting his entire body. Even his head was shielded with a helmet, leaving just a pair of sparkling eyes.</p><p>&#x201C;I will ask again, who is behind this attack, dark Magus!&#x201D; The middle aged man continuously staggered backwards, his hands stealthily reaching into his robes.</p><p>&#x201C;You talk too much!&#x201D;</p><p>Leylin struck again, his crimson claws leaving a scratch on the yellow armour.</p><p>&#x201C;It&#x2019;s useless!&#x201D; The middle aged Magus howled. Traces of brown energy particles were continuously being absorbed into the dents of the armour, quickly restoring most traces of damage.</p><p>[Target&#x2019;s innate spell has been scanned and recorded. Beginning simulation and parameter testing to find out the weakest point!]</p><p>The A.I. Chip&#x2019;s voice intoned. It also projected the 3D image of a human figure wearing the yellow armour. Several points on the armour were marked red, representing the weak points.</p><p>While Leylin attacked, the middle-aged Magus withdrew a scroll from his robes, from which tremendous energy waves emanated.</p><p>&#x201C;A formidable spell in a scroll? I can&#x2019;t let him activate it!&#x201D; Leylin&#x2019;s pupils contracted as he let loose an extremely high-pitched shriek.</p><p>&#x201C;Hisssss&#x2026;&#x201D; This was the voice of an extremely venomous snake, and was so unpleasant to the ears that it could draw goosebumps from others.</p><p>When the sound waves reached the middle-aged Magus, a blank look appeared on his face, and the speed at which he was opening the scroll slowed.</p><p>&#x201C;Right here!&#x201D; Leylin&#x2019;s footsteps moved in a bizarre manner as he rapidly increased his speed and covered a distance of over ten meters. In the blink of an eye, he arrived in front of the middle-aged Magus.</p><p>The bright red light of the Crimson Palm on his right hand shone even more vividly as he clawed at the area 3 inches above the Magus&#x2019; abdomen, which was protected by his armour.</p><p>The first claw! A depression the size of a fist appeared in the brown armour, and a large part of the armour fell.</p><p>The second claw! The middle-aged Magus&#x2019; innate defensive spell was destroyed by Leylin.</p><p>&#x201C;No! Please forgive me, the value of a Magus kept in captive is high!&#x201D;</p><p>It was obvious that this light Magus was used to living a privileged lifestyle, and lacked the will to even fight for his own life, sinking to his knees in front of Leylin.</p><p>However, Leylin&#x2019;s face was ice cold, like a thousand year old frost. His right hand struck again, crushing the middle-aged Magus&#x2019; head like a watermelon.</p><p>*Crunch!*</p><p>White brain matter and scarlet blood stained Leylin&#x2019;s hands. His hands seemed even more demonic and alluring.</p><p>&#x201C;There&#x2019;s an unexpected reward!&#x201D;</p><p>Leylin picked up the Magus&#x2019; scroll, his face filled with glee.</p><p>&#x201C;A pretty good scroll; the energy waves are extremely strong. It seems like it should be able to hold its own even amongst rank 1 spells! It should be worth quite a bit of magic crystals&#x2026;&#x201D;</p><p>Right at this moment, a wretched scream caught Leylin&#x2019;s attention.</p><p></p><hr><p></p>
