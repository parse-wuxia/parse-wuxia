<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>The Headquarters&#x2019; Location</strong></span></p><p>&#x201D;I...I&#x2026;&#x201D;</p><p>Mully hesitated. Although he doubted the other party&#x2019;s strength, Magi were a rational bunch. If it wasn&#x2019;t for Celine, he would not even dare to provoke the other party.</p><p>Now, he was somewhat uncertain.</p><p>If Leylin really possessed such huge power and he decided to challenge him, wouldn&#x2019;t he be courting death?</p><p>Immediately, Mully opened his mouth wide, &#x201C; This&#x2026; this is&#x2026;&#x201D;</p><p>In this moment, Leylin had already thrown the ice mountain on the floor, producing a loud sound.</p><p>Within the ice mountain stood a thin bodied Icy Jade Scorpion that was unmoving, as if it were a statue.</p><p>&#x201C;Celine! Get some people here and move these items!&#x201D; Leylin contacted Celine through the secret imprint, and from the other end came a surprised squeal.</p><p>&#x201C;Oh? Previously, Magus Leylin went down with the purpose to do research on the Icy Jade Scorpion. It looks like his gains were pretty good! Unexpectedly, he even caught a smaller one. It seems like it&#x2019;s a young one!&#x201D;</p><p>Old Madre smiled and explained.</p><p>While in its frozen state, the Icy Jade Scorpion&#x2019;s breath was suppressed to its lowest and Old Madre did not see it.</p><p>&#x201C;No, damn it! This isn&#x2019;t some young Icy Jade Scorpion! It&#x2019;s the Icy Jade Scorpion Emperor! A peak rank 1 Icy Jade Scorpion Emperor!&#x201D; Mully retreated while stammering.</p><p>&#x201C;I have seen it before. This is absolutely the Icy Jade Scorpion Emperor! Look at the terrifying markings on its back!&#x201D;</p><p>Mully retreated to the edge of the site, afraid that the Icy Jade Scorpion Emperor would go wild at any time.</p><p>&#x201C;Raurghhh&#x2026; Seriously!&#x201D;</p><p>Madre picked up what seemed like a pair of glasses and placed it on his nose, taking a good look at the Icy Jade Scorpion. This was then followed by a squeal as she took a few steps back.</p><p>&#x201C;Mag&#x2026; Magus Leylin! Di- Did you catch this?&#x201D;</p><p>Old Madre started to stammer as well.</p><p>&#x201C;Of course!&#x201D; Leylin smiled and nodded.</p><p>After having suppressed the emotional instability from his bloodline, Leylin massacred all of the regular Icy Jade Scorpions and collected their materials. As for the Icy Jade Scorpion Emperor, he could not bear to kill it.</p><p>After all, its value while still alive was much greater than the value of the materials on its body.</p><p>He still had many simulations that he needed to complete on the Icy Jade Scorpion Emperor, and Leylin was also extremely interested in the waning of the Icy Jade Scorpion&#x2019;s life once it were to leave the radiation from the icy cave.</p><p>Hence, he had to wrap the Icy Jade Scorpion Emperor and bring it out.</p><p>Leylin could only gather all the materials from the regular Icy Jade Scorpions inside the spatial pouch, and since it could not hold living beings, he had to carry an ice mountain all the way out.</p><p>However, the look of disbelief on the faces of these two Magi that turned into one of respect was rather amusing to Leylin.</p><p>He did not intentionally try to conceal his powers, but there was the underlying intent of showing his might.</p><p>After all, the might of a peak rank 1 Magus was not unfounded, and an Icy Jade Scorpion Emperor with a strength comparable to a peak rank 1 Magus was enough to intimidate everyone.</p><p>Although Celine had been actively disseminating the information of her guild, she had not acquired the acknowledgment from the other guilds as Leylin had been keeping a low profile. Most Magi had even thought of this as an elaborate scam and were here merely to look for trouble.</p><p>But now, these small guilds would think twice before coming forward.</p><p>Though he wasn&#x2019;t afraid of trouble, he hated having to personally involve himself in these small matters. It wasn&#x2019;t a bad idea to scare them away with this Icy Jade Scorpion Emperor.</p><p>Even between peak rank 1 Magi, their battle abilities were varied. Since Leylin was able to catch a Icy Jade Scorpion Emperor that was similar to a peak rank 1 Magus, didn&#x2019;t that mean that he was at the top of the peak rank 1 Magi?</p><p>Old Madre and Mully exchanged glances, and their gazes towards Leylin was filled with reverence.</p><p>&#x201C;Lord Leylin, it&#x2019;s great that you could come back safely!&#x201D;</p><p>At this point, Celine was excited as she brought back the two acolytes from before.</p><p>Leylin looked at them and nodded. It seemed like Celine had been waiting here with these two acolytes after he had left, which was rather considerate of her.</p><p>&#x201C;An Icy Jade Scorpion is a creature with the might of an official Magus and they lived in clusters. Initially, I had my worries, but thankfully we were under the blessing of Gaia!&#x201D;</p><p>Celine patted herself on her chest and was hesitant at the start, as she was worried for Leylin.</p><p>Hearing that, Old Madre and Mully surreptitiously rolled their eyes.</p><p>The one who should be worried should be the Icy Jade Scorpions. This Lord had already captured the Icy Jade Scorpion Emperor and the remaining Icy Jade Scorpions had either disbanded or sought refuge with the other cyclones.</p><p>At this moment, Celine found the ice mountain beside Leylin, &#x201C; Do we need to move this?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;En! Send two people to follow me to shift it to the Eastern capital before we look for a lab to analyse it further.&#x201D; Leylin patted on the ice mountain behind him.</p><p>&#x201C; If you wish to find a lab, the headquarters of the Nature&#x2019;s Alliance is just nearby for your Lordship&#x2019;s usage.&#x201D;</p><p>Celine&#x2019;s eyes sparkled and suggested, &#x201C;Furthermore, I would like to discuss in detail with your Lordship regarding the previous matter.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Your headquarters is nearby? Great, let&#x2019;s go!&#x201D; Leylin nodded in agreement. There wasn&#x2019;t anything important in the basement he used in the eastern capital. All valuable equipment was carried on his person at all times.</p><p>As for the overall facilities, Nature&#x2019;s Alliance&#x2019;s lab was definitely better than his own established lab.</p><p>&#x201C;Hop on and call another carriage to move this ice mountain back to the headquarters!&#x201D;</p><p>Celine commanded. She went forward to take a good look at the Icy Jade Scorpion.</p><p>Through the translucent ice, a rune that closely resembled a face could be seen at the back of the Icy Jade Scorpion.</p><p>&#x201C;This is&#x2026; the Icy Jade Scorpion Emperor!!!&#x201D; Celine covered her mouth with her eyes wide opened.</p><p>&#x2026;&#x2026;</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>A huge waterfall which seemed to fall from the sky like a white curtain, created huge splashes in the underground pond. A constant rumbling sound of the water echoed in the surroundings.</p><p>After passing the waterfall, there was a small canyon.</p><p>Scattered around the canyon was a variety of plantations and some historical structures.</p><p>The landmarks and road signs were covered in vines, with constant rays of light shining from above.</p><p>This was where the Nature&#x2019;s Alliance headquarters resided.</p><p>Leylin looked around with curiosity at the whimsical constructions.</p><p>Although these buildings appeared slightly run-down, there were slight glints of magical glows which indicated the existence of a powerful spell that had been cast on the wooden walls.</p><p>Nature&#x2019;s Alliance, albeit being a small guild, had accumulated their high-level meditation techniques over multiple generations in the past hundreds and thousands of years, proving their might.</p><p>Periodically, a few Magi acolytes, dressed in grey gowns, would come out of the building to greet Celine.</p><p>&#x201C;Oh Celine, it has been so long since you last visited!&#x201D;</p><p>At the same time, a grey mole jumped out from a human-sized mushroom and lifted its claw, greeting Celine.</p><p>The grey mole was the size of a boy and had sparkling bright eyes brimming with liveliness. It had a spotlessly white moustache that dropped down from the bottom of its mouth to the floor.</p><p>&#x201C;Nice to meet you, Grandpa Cedric!&#x201D;</p><p>Celine expressed with respect, &#x201C;I brought your favourite berries!&#x201D;</p><p>Celine carefully placed the two strange fruits that looked like green dates on the ground.</p><p>&#x201C;En! Not bad! That&#x2019;s my favourite!&#x201D; The gigantic mole used its agile claws to pick up the fruits and threw them into its mouth, crunching noisily,</p><p>&#x201C;This is my newly recruited famous professor, Leylin Farlier! He will be having the same level of authority as me!&#x201D; Celine introduced, after the mole finished eating.</p><p>&#x201C;Leylin what?&#x201D; The mole took a good look at Leylin with beaming eyes. &#x201C;En! Deep and immeasurable power! Looks like you have pinned all your hopes on him...:&#x201D;</p><p>Leylin looked at the mole, &#x201C; A guard animal? It has the strength of a rank 1 Magus. Not bad.&#x201D;</p><p>At this time, Celine introduced to Leylin, &#x201C; Grandpa Cedric was Nature&#x2019;s Alliance&#x2019;s guardian during my great great grandmother&#x2019;s time. He is usually very gentle, just don&#x2019;t disturb his sleep&#x2026;&#x201D;</p><p>After introducing the two to each other, Celine brought Leylin to a hall.</p><p>There were tens of acolytes waiting in there. Seated at the front were Obo and Ilya whom Leylin previously met.</p><p>&#x201C;To think that a Magus guild will end up with only a rank 1 Magus, an animal as a gatekeeper and a few apprentices. What a failure!&#x201D;</p><p>Leylin became speechless as he followed Celine in.</p><p>Celine went forward and introduced Leylin to the acolytes, &#x201C;This is Professor Leylin whom I&#x2019;ve invited over! From now, all of you need to respect him like how you respect me. No, you all should treat him with even more respect, do you all hear me?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Professor Leylin!&#x201D; The acolyte greeted with their beaming eyes.</p><p>Leylin&#x2019;s past achievements slowly spread around through Obo and Ilya. The apprentices felt extremely happy and elated knowing that they have a rank 1 Magus taking charge.</p><p>&#x201C;Nice to meet all of you! A Magus is a follower of the truth. I hope to see all of you in the hall in the future!&#x201D;</p><p>Leylin spoke a few words and indicated Celine to let the students leave.</p><p>All along, Leylin did not like such situations and furthermore, he was not interested in the group of acolytes.</p><p>The sole purpose of gathering the students was to introduce Leylin. The introduction ended within minutes, leaving Celine and Leylin in the hall after the students left.</p><p>&#x201C;Can we talk now? Seems like something was wrong before I left the icy cave.&#x201D;</p><p>Leylin took a glance at Celine as he asked with a smile.</p><p>&#x201C;I can&#x2019;t seem to hide anything from you!&#x201D; Celine bit her lips and finally made up her mind.</p><p></p><hr><p></p>
