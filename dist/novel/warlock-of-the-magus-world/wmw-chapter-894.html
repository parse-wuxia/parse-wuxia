<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>Ambush</strong></span></p><p>The roars and howling of beasts filled the vicinity, putting everyone on edge.</p><p>Lanshire laughed hysterically, &#x201C;Hah! All of you will die with me! You can never beat those werecreatures! Every one of you will be torn apart and then swallowed; your souls will be caged in the depths of hell!&#x201D;</p><p>After spitting out her malicious curse, Lanshire&#x2019;s face flushed and fresh blood spurted out from her mouth. Her aura completely disappeared as she died.</p><p>&#x201C;Ignore her! Listen to me, engage defensive formation.&#x201D; Seeing that Aulen wasn&#x2019;t in a good condition, Leylin took over command.</p><p>It was only now that he found out what exactly had happened directly from Ogg, and began to organise the troops. In reality, everything that happened tonight was within Leylin&#x2019;s plan. Firstly, he found Aulen and told her that they may have a spy within their ranks to win her support, which allowed him to plant the trap.</p><p>And to make things easy for the possible attack, the brothers, Ogg and Otto were sent out to be on standby.</p><p>&#x201C;There were high-ranked werecreatures, so many of them, I&#x2013; I can&#x2019;t be sure of the exact number, but my brother tried to protect me- He tried to protect me and-&#x201D; Ogg&#x2019;s eyes swelled red with tears and his facial muscles began to twitch.</p><p>&#x201C;Heal!&#x201D; A spell flew forth from Jinx&#x2019;s hands, and swiftly cured most of Ogg&#x2019;s severe wounds.</p><p>&#x201C;I&#x2019;m gonna kill those damned beast bastards!&#x201D; He stood up and grabbed his enormous claw hammer without waiting for his wounds to recover completely.</p><p>&#x201C;Were you the only one who managed to escape in the close combat team? It looks like I underestimated our enemies this time round.&#x201D; Leylin looked slightly ashamed, but a light flashed deep within in his eyes.</p><p>Whether it was done intentionally or not, the capture and exposure of Lanshire&#x2019;s identity as a spy and her death had dealt a huge blow to Aulen. Moreover, the troops led by Ogg and Otto were now left with casualties, and Otto had even died; Silverymoon City would have to compensate Otto&#x2019;s family for that later on. Jinx was a priest and under heavy restriction, while Rafiniya was a new member and did not have enough experience.</p><p>The event seemed to have cleared quite a number of obstacles for him, but Leylin would never admit to that. He would probably say that it was a coincidence!</p><p>By then, the werecreatures were already directly outside the campsite, their mountainous shadows and the screams of the guards causing horror to tinge the atmosphere.</p><p>&#x201C;Everyone stay close, we&#x2019;re in trouble.&#x201D; An Eternal Flame spell lit up Leylin&#x2019;s palm, and he managed to repel a large amount of the fog. As the soldiers gathered together, he managed to see the werecreatures more clearly.</p><p>This was a humongous group with at least 200 of the monsters among them, six of which had exceptionally strong physiques and savage auras.</p><p>&#x201C;High-ranked werecreatures, and there&#x2019;s 6 of them!&#x201D; Even the perturbed Aulen was now anxious. The werecreatures&#x2019; strength had greatly surpassed their expectations. If they were at all careless, their troop would be completely wiped out.</p><p>Suppressing her emotions, Aulen returned to her cool-headed self and sent out commands, &#x201C;Defensive formation number 2!&#x201D;</p><p>How could she not have realised that Lanshire had conspired with the werecreatures to kill everyone here?</p><p>&#x201C;Lanshire, my friend. I&#x2019;m sorry!&#x201D; Aulen muttered to herself and drew out her elven sword, the shaft decorated in plant motifs. Its lustre suggested that it was an enchanted item.</p><p>*Boom! Boom!* Giant footsteps sounded out, and several giants that were at least ten metres tall emerged from the fog. They were like walking hills clothed in coppery skin.</p><p>&#x201C;G-Giants! These werecreatures managed to tame giants!&#x201D; Aulen&#x2019;s hand trembled ever so slightly as she watched these human-like but also bizarre creatures, and some soldiers even yelped in despair.</p><p>&#x201C;Giants? Those extraordinary creatures from the north?&#x201D; Leylin massaged his temples in distress as data of the creatures was presented to him.</p><p>[Name Unknown. Race: Giant. Strength: 15. Agility: 6. Vitality: 13. Spirit: 2. Feats: 1. Strong 2. Regeneration 3. Armoured Skin. Description: A unique creature that only exists in the north. Cruel and fierce in temperament, unintelligent, easily tamed by other barbaric tribes.]</p><p>&#x201C;Looking at this strength, they&#x2019;re most certainly connected to the Blackblood tribe. They might even be a branch! Cassley obviously wanted us to die.&#x201D; Aulen laughed bitterly.</p><p>&#x201C;Prepare to break through! We can only evacuate as many as we can.&#x201D; She now seemed to have lost heart.</p><p>&#x201C;Elf from Silverymoon City, and other humans!&#x201D; A shadow walked out from the group of werecreatures.</p><p>He was 2 metres tall, and had an appearance similar to that of a human. The difference was that he had unusual beastly patterns all over his face, and certain body parts of a beast.</p><p>He choked in disgust after sniffing in the direction of Leylin and the rest, &#x201C;Damn Silverymoon City! That is a place of evil, it should be wiped clean!&#x201D;</p><p>As followers of Malar, the werecreatures were naturally hostile towards the civilised beings of Silverymoon City and hated all who dwelled within it. The city guards were undoubtedly their first target.</p><p>&#x201C;All of you will die here today! You are all too worthless to even be sacrificed to my Lord!&#x201D; The werecreatures growled, and more petrifying shadows headed towards them.</p><p>Werecreatures had robust physiques and a staggering jumping ability. The temporary barriers by the side of the campsite posed no deterrence to them. *Roar!* The giants grunted and every step they took was like a miniature earthquake, flipping tents and crushing soldiers under their feet.</p><p>&#x201C;Damn it! Leylin, protect me!&#x201D; The elegance of an elf was long forgotten to Aulen as her eyes were red with anxiety and she pulled the elven bow from her back.</p><p>Greater Magic Weapon! Leylin&#x2019;s expression became heavy as the lustre of a high-grade spell burst forth from his hand.</p><p>*Phew!* Silver arrows went off like shooting stars, the spell-filled arrowheads hitting the giants right in their eyes, their weakest points. The giants&#x2019; defences still couldn&#x2019;t match high-grade spells, and this was aimed at their eyes.</p><p>The giants roared as their eyes cracked apart in a soft explosion, copious amount of shimmering liquid and blood dripping everywhere.</p><p>One pressed a palm against his injured eye as he went berserk, charging towards Aulen.</p><p>Grease! Spell rays enveloped the giants as Leylin took advantage of this moment. He wouldn&#x2019;t be himself if he let go of the chance to target the giants&#x2019; weakness.</p><p>*Bang!* Magnificent lights shot out of his hands like fireworks, and the group of giants immediately went berserk. Even the werecreatures were unable to calm them down.</p><p>Everything was in a frenzy as they roared wildly and attacked everything in their vicinity, including a handful werecreatures who were shredded into pieces.</p><p>&#x201C;It&#x2019;s a high-grade spell attack! Get rid of that darned wizard, I&#x2019;ll dispel it!&#x201D; A werecreature clad in a priest robe stood out in the chaos. He, too, had strange decorative motifs and paint on his face.</p><p>&#x201C;Kill!&#x201D; Aulen made use of this chance and charged forwards with Rafiniya and the rest. The only way they could survive under a situation like this was to go all-in. The soldiers were well aware of this too as they plucked up their remaining courage, following Aulen&#x2019;s lead and charging ahead.</p><p>*Roar!* The clash of the two opposing sides created a fierce orchestra of howls and clangs of steel meeting steel.</p><p>And yet everything was in vain. Aulen&#x2019;s numbers started to dwindle, and they could not win no matter how great their fighting spirit was. The werecreatures were just too many.</p><p>&#x201C;Go to hell!&#x201D; Having been enhanced by magic, the sword in Aulen&#x2019;s hand was brighter than ever. It could easily pierce through the defences of the werecreatures and cause unimaginable damage to their internal organs.</p><p>With it, Aulen severed the heads of 3 werecreatures in a flash and attracted the attention of their companion&#x2014; a high-ranked werecreature.</p><p>&#x201C;I admit you&#x2019;re strong. But too bad; you&#x2019;re still going to hell!&#x201D; The werecreature priest suddenly towered over Aulen like a huge and tenacious mountain which she could not scale.</p><p>&#x2026;&#x2026;</p><p>&#x201C;I&#x2019;m your opponent!&#x201D;</p><p>Leylin had already cast Fly, and was blocking the priest from saving his companions.</p><p>&#x201C;Mid-ranked wizard, you&#x2019;re not worthy to become a sacrifice!&#x201D; The werecreature said in pity, and looked into Leylin&#x2019;s blood-lust-filled eyes as if looking at his prey. It caused Leylin to furrow his brow uneasily.</p><p>&#x2018;I can&#x2019;t be sure what other abilities this rank 15 or higher priest has. Hopefully Tiff and the rest will make it here soon!&#x2019;</p><p>But of course, Leylin had more than one plan. He was also confident of escaping. As a wizard, there were countless life-saving spells. A simple Fly could get him out of the scene in a matter of seconds as long as he wasn&#x2019;t shot down. Rank 15 wizards would escape death even more easily with Teleport.</p><p>This priest in front of him would just be a headache.</p><p></p><hr><p></p>
