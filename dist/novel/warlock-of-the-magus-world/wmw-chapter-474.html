Leylin&#x2019;s eyebrows furrowed, but not taking such intimate actions to heart.</p><p>&#x201D;What exactly did you ask me to come here for?&#x201D; Leylin thought Freya was not one to look for him because of a small matter&#x2014; Miranda would be more likely to do that.</p><p>Once a serious topic was mentioned, all other expressions left Freya&#x2019;s face as she turned solemn,&#x201C;Do you know about the events related to the Purgatory World?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201D;As far as I know, the elders seem to have acquired some clues, and now they should be searching for the specific coordinates!&#x201D; Leylin said with an equally strict expression.</p><p>&#x201C;Actually, the search has almost been completed. According to my master&#x2019;s plan, I&#x2019;m afraid we&#x2019;ll all have to go to the headquarters to participate in the experiments!&#x201D; Freya added, smiling bitterly.</p><p>&#x201D;This is a responsibility we cannot shirk!&#x201D; Leylin seemed solemn.</p><p>&#x201D;It&#x2019;s just that&#x2026; I have a really bad feeling about this&#x2026;&#x201D; worry surfaced on Freya&#x2019;s face, &#x201C;Even in the ancient era, the Purgatory World was a tremendously powerful world, so how is it possible that it would be so easily found? Even if it is found, how would anyone then go past the protectors to enter?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;I&#x2019;m sure the mentors have already considered these questions&#x2026;&#x201D; Leylin considered his own words as he spoke.</p><p>&#x201C;Well, I sure hope so!&#x201D; Freya breathed a long sigh, then suddenly remembered something else, &#x201C;These days, the outside world does not seem to be at peace; you must be careful. These are for you&#x2026;&#x201D;</p><p>Freya pushed a box over to Leylin. Leylin opened it to find numerous glittering and translucent crystals neatly placed inside.</p><p>&#x201C;Spiritual force crystals? Those that have had their markings completely removed?&#x201D;</p><p>Leylin was taken by surprise. A Crystal Phase Magus could naturally store and preserve his own crystallised spiritual force, and leave these crystals for future use.</p><p>But for such a pure colour to appear meant that Freya not only washed away all the spiritual force inside her crystals, but she also eliminated all her spiritual imprints.</p><p>To a Crystal Phase Magus, this was no different from reducing their own spiritual force. Although it wasn&#x2019;t impossible to replenish them, it was still extremely troublesome.</p><p>Such crystals with their marks removed could be given to other Crystal Phase Magi to use, and could quickly replenish spiritual force. They were rare treasures, and had always been a top-class resource that was only circulated among Crystal Phase Magi.</p><p>For Freya, someone who had just advanced to the Crystal Phase, this gift was extremely precious to give.</p><p>Freya stopped Leylin before he could say anything. &#x201C;Don&#x2019;t decline it, this is what you deserve. I have yet to thank you for the bloodline crystals from last time&#x2026;&#x201D;</p><p>Leylin remained silent for a while, but eventually, managed to speak to express his gratitude, &#x201C;Thank...thank you&#x2026;&#x201D;</p><p>&#x2026;&#x2026;</p><p>A black horse-carriage slowly exited from the Ancient Blood Serpent Castle&#x2019;s main gate..</p><p>Inside the magnificent carriage sat Leylin. He was looking at the box in his hand, a bitter smile on his face.</p><p>&#x201C;She&#x2019;s very considerate&#x2026;&#x201D; He sighed lightly. During this period of an unknown crisis, Freya was still able to remember him. This thought inevitably led Leylin&#x2019;s heart to flutter.</p><p>&#x201C;In the future, if I have the means, I will definitely help you!&#x201D; Leylin firmly decided in his mind.</p><p>&#x201C;Are you certain the target is inside?&#x201D;</p><p>Not far away, there were tremors felt on the ground surface. Two shadows dressed in yellow appeared. &#x201C;It is confirmed, inside that carriage is the Ouroboros Clan&#x2019;s Marquis, Leylin!&#x201D;</p><p>The other figure had a scratchy voice.</p><p>&#x201C;Hehe...this is the Magus who the Demon Hunter put a high price on&#x2026; And he has Hydro Phase strength!&#x201D; The person who spoke first immediately laughed coldly.</p><p>&#x201C;Everything is already prepared. Once our target enters the ambush, we spring into action at once!&#x201D; There was a hint of bloodthirst in that scratchy voice.</p><p>&#x201C;Hmm?!&#x201D; Leylin, who was just resting on the carriage, abruptly opened his eyes, revealing a cheeky smile.</p><p>&#x201C;Someone wants to attack me?&#x201D; Although he had not heard the conversation between the two shadows, the A.I Chip&#x2019;s detection clearly showed that, in the forest not far away, there was a trap.</p><p>Even if the other party had already carefully set up three layers of aura-concealing spell formations, from Leylin&#x2019;s point of view these spell formations were like sieves that were filled with holes.</p><p>Especially the radiation from the Magi hidden within&#x2014; that was as obvious as a burning torch in the night.</p><p>&#x201C;Julian!&#x201D; He called in a low voice.</p><p>&#x201C;What&#x2019;s the matter, Lord Marquis?&#x201D; the coachman from outside replied immediately.</p><p>&#x201C;Maintain the speed, there&#x2019;s a group of friends ahead of us waiting for a greeting!&#x201D; Leylin spoke in a low voice, and he was certain the Magus had already understood what he meant..</p><p>&#x201C;Yes, my lord!&#x201D; Upon hearing this piece of news, Julian&#x2019;s voice was still ever so steady, like he was not in the least bit worried.</p><p>The grand horse-carriage proceeded at a constant speed, moving along on the road by the forest as if unaware.</p><p>A yellow fireball boomed as it crashed down on them, ruining the walls of the carriage and causing it to break apart. The giant rut and the wheels of the carriage flew out.</p><p>A waft of smoke rose just outside the area, isolating this piece of land from the rest of the world.</p><p>A few men dressed in black immediately pounced towards the carriage. One of them held a huge hammer up high, and smashed down on the carriage directly.</p><p>The land rumbled as the huge hammer mercilessly crushed the remains of the carriage and created a gigantic pit, as if by an earthquake that sent out strange ripples.</p><p>&#x201C;Eh? There&#x2019;s no one?&#x201D; The person who spoke was someone with the voice of a child, and the body of a seven- or eight-year-old. Yet, he was holding a hammer that was bigger than his own body, making him look a little ridiculous.</p><p>&#x201C;Blacksmith Mia? I don&#x2019;t recall there being any grudges between us.&#x201D; Several black tendrils covered the whole area, and Leylin carried the trembling coachman as they walked out of the shadows.</p><p>&#x201C;Hehe! Do I need a reason to kill you?&#x201D; Mia lifted her hood, revealing a face befitting the body. A face that should have been filled with the joy of a child was instead warped with bloodlust.</p><p>Blacksmith Mia was the central continent&#x2019;s most infamous bandit, a peak Crystal Phase Magus with countless crimes to her name. Under the guise of a little girl hid a vicious, scary monster. She&#x2019;d once used a metal hammer to kill an entire family of Magi. Male, female, old, young; no matter who it was, they were simply added to the mountain of flesh.</p><p>&#x201C;And I reckon these people are courting death too?&#x201D; Leylin looked around at the other few black shadows. Numerous elemental particles transformed into shields and appeared before him.</p><p>&#x201C;Assassin Hill! Brutal Bear Fein!&#x201D;...</p><p>A few of the Magi reported their names successively. They were all characters whose names were known far and wide for their notoriety.And they all emitted waves of Crystal Phase energy.</p><p>&#x201C;You sure do think highly of me&#x2026;&#x201D; Leylin said, smiling while shaking his head. Without warning, he sprung forth violently.</p><p>&#x201C;Go to hell!&#x201D; He whirled the coachman who was in his arms upwards, smashing him towards Mia as if he were a sandbag. The numerous potion bottles on him scattered outwards.</p><p>&#x201C;Rank 3 potion combination spell, Divine Prairie Flames!&#x201D; Burning flames immediately formed a wall of fire in front of him, isolating Hill and Fein to one side.</p><p>On the other end, the coachman who was thrown by Leylin changed in a bizarre manner. Mia, who was standing in front of him, whirled the heavy hammer without regard for anything, trying to smash the coachman into pulp.</p><p>He pulled out a golden dagger in mid-air, and his whole temperament instantly changed. The originally timid man turned sinister and crazy, as if a cowardly rabbit transforming into a tiger.</p><p>&#x201C;Blacksmith Mia?&#x201D; He laughed coldly. His whole body seemed to have become as flexible as a snake&#x2019;s, and he moved his body in a way no ordinary person would ever be able to as he avoided the huge hammer. In the same instant, he stabbed the dagger right into Mia&#x2019;s chest.</p><p>*Weng!* An aura of gold was emitted from Mia&#x2019;s body, but even that was shockingly dimmed as it was stabbed firmly by the dagger.</p><p>Mia&#x2019;s body went stiff for a split second before her innate defensive spell shattered into pieces under the dagger&#x2019;s attack.</p><p>Swiftly after, the sharp dagger mercilessly slashed at Mia&#x2019;s skin and its sharp blade entered right through her chest, ripping through flesh and entering her internals.</p><p>Seeing the fresh red blood spurting out, the coachman&#x2019;s face instantly revealed joy. And yet, the moment he saw a crazed expression on Mia&#x2019;s face, his heart froze.</p><p>&#x201C;Die!&#x201D; Mia let go of the hammer. Holding on to a dagger, she crashed forward.</p><p>The sound of bones breaking came from the coachman&#x2019;s body. His face revealed his astonishment as blood flew from his mouth onto the street.</p><p>&#x201C;Boneless Snake Julian?&#x201D; Mia&#x2019;s body constantly wiggled, covering and repairing her internal organs and wounds immediately. She looked at Julian with eyes filled with hatred.</p><p>&#x201C;As expected of the legendary Magus with body refinement, who soaked in the Corrosion Swamp! To think my strength and magic equipment isn&#x2019;t enough to kill you in one shot!&#x201D;</p><p>Having been revealed, there were slight alterations to the coachman&#x2019;s face, and Hydro Phase waves were emitted from his body. He was a Magus as well!</p><p>Or rather, an advanced Magus who had already reached Hydro Phase.</p><p>The Boneless Snake, Julian, was one of Freya&#x2019;s family&#x2019;s most powerful warriors. He was notorious for assassination ability, causing enemies to be terror-stricken at the thought of his existence.</p><p>&#x201C;Damn it, I knew those bastards&#x2019; plan was not reliable!&#x201D; Mia&#x2019;s face changed. &#x201C;Retreat immediately!&#x201D;</p><p>Hill and Fein glanced at each other, doubt surfacing on their faces.</p><p>Even if Julian and Leylin stood shoulder to shoulder, they were merely two Hydro Phase Magi. On the other hand, their group had a bunch of Crystal Phase Magi who had been famous for a long time, how could they run away from them with their tails tucked between their legs?</p><p>But subsequently, their facial expressions drastically changed.</p><p>&#x201C;Pssssst!&#x201D;</p><p>A menacing Blood Serpent&#x2019;s shadow abruptly bombarded the surrounding haze. The whole spell formation was immediately breached.</p><p>Warriors wearing dark red Magus robes with Giant Kemoyin Serpent tattoos surrounded the area, and covered Leylin who had just been promoted to the Crystal Phase.</p><p>&#x201C;Ouroboros Clan Warlocks?&#x201D;</p><p>Hill cried out beneath his breath, knowing that today&#x2019;s business would be hard to handle&#x2026;</p><p></p><hr><p></p>
