<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong></strong></span></p><p><strong>Acquaintances</strong></p><p>&#x201C;I signed the contract under the witness of the Trial&#x2019;s Eye, promising not to do anything that would harm Four Seasons Garden&#x2019;s interests! If I go back on that agreement, I would undergo judgement&#x2026;&#x201D;</p><p>This was Leylin&#x2019;s largest concern.</p><p>If he had the choice, he didn&#x2019;t want to harm Four Seasons Garden since they had treated him quite well from the beginning.</p><p>&#x201C;That&#x2019;s easily solved! Here is a solution of Filthy Birds&#x2019; wings. As long as you have it, you can nullify your contract with the Four Seasons Garden!&#x201D;</p><p>Giant threw a bottle of grey solution towards Leylin.</p><p>&#x201C;You even have items that are already extinct!&#x201D; Leylin caught the bottle and let the A.I. Chip test the authenticity of the item. The results made him gasp.</p><p>With such a degree of preparation, it wouldn&#x2019;t be a stretch to say that this had been premeditated long ago.</p><p>&#x201C;Hehe&#x2026; This isn&#x2019;t mine but belongs to the &#x2018;Boss&#x2019; behind me. He especially left this for you from his own collection!&#x201D;</p><p>Giant did not claim the credit for himself and used a straightforward tone, which made Leylin slightly fearful.</p><p>&#x201C;So, what&#x2019;s your answer?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Acknowledging the strength of others is the instinct of all dark Magi. I first need to verify your strength!&#x201D; Leylin pondered for a moment and then spoke.</p><p>&#x201C;You will see...&#x201D; Giant&#x2019;s voice began to be less discernible.</p><p>Large amounts of green mist shrouded the surrounding area, enveloping Leylin within.</p><p>Some time later, the mist dispersed and Leylin left, his expression serious. He seemed to be worrying about many things.</p><p>&#x201C;I never thought it&#x2019;d be him&#x2026;&#x201D;</p><p>Following which, Leylin calmed himself and returned to his accommodations, as if nothing had happened.</p><p>After a night passed, Leylin continued on his journey.</p><p>The Eternal River Plains were situated at the border between the light and dark Magi&#x2019;s territories. Security there was the most chaotic.</p><p>Here, even within the city, armed confrontations, robbery, murder, and other crimes happened daily. At times, there would even be the occasional battle between Magi!</p><p>In this situation, the guards of the city were more like professional corpse carriers and were in charge of clearing the roads everyday.</p><p>After Eternal River Plains&#x2019; secret plane had been discovered, a large number of Magi flowed in, causing even more chaos in this place.</p><p>On the way, just the number of people who were looking to seek revenge was above 15. This meant that every once in awhile, there would be someone with such a motivation.</p><p>If not for Leylin and his group wearing clothing that gave them an air of mystery, even Magi like them might meet with some trouble.</p><p>After walking out of a city of regular humans, Leylin suddenly started, seeming to have seen some familiar figures.</p><p>&#x201C;Master, what&#x2019;s wrong? Is there something wrong with those acolytes?&#x201D;</p><p>Number 2 and 3 approached him and enquired.</p><p>&#x201C;It&#x2019;s nothing!&#x201D; Leylin answered casually. Even if it was them, they were from two different worlds. Leylin wasn&#x2019;t planning on maintaining any contact with them, and passing them by. This might be the best for them.</p><p>Sometimes, however, fate was such a strange thing that could not be hindered.</p><p>Just as Leylin was hastening his travelling and leaving the gates, he bumped into those acolytes from earlier.</p><p>&#x201C;Leylin! Hi! Leylin! Is that you?&#x201D; Within the group of acolytes, a tall young man standing in the front was yelling excitedly.</p><p>They had been quite a distance away previously, but now that they met, the acolyte opposite to Leylin had instantly recognised him.</p><p>&#x201C;Long time no see!&#x201D; Leylin watched the acolytes, who were moving forward attentively, and couldn&#x2019;t help but give a gentle smile in greeting.</p><p>After strengthening his body, Leylin&#x2019;s physique and sight had vastly improved. He could easily see that out of all the acolytes, the one who had shouted was very tall and a had a head of long golden hair, thick eyebrows, large eyes, and a high nose bridge.</p><p>There was also a female acolyte with an exquisitely curvy body, silver hair and eyes like rubies. She constantly emanated an exotic charm.</p><p>Leylin immediately recognised these two acolytes. They were the people he hadn&#x2019;t seen in ages&#x2014;George and Bessita!</p><p>&#x201C;But isn&#x2019;t George an acolyte at the Ennea Ivory Ring Tower? Why is he together with Bessita, who&#x2019;s from Wetland Gardens Academy?&#x201D;</p><p>This thought went through his mind for a split second before he was interrupted, as George had brought Bessita and the others to approach him.</p><p>&#x201C;Leylin, it&#x2019;s really you! I thought I&#x2019;d gotten the wrong person!&#x201D;</p><p>George was a good friend that he&#x2019;d made on that first journey in the beginning, and just like before, he affectionately gave Leylin a bear hug.</p><p>Bessita, on the other hand, was twiddling her fingers at the side, seemingly embarrassed.</p><p>At the beginning, she had caused much trouble for Leylin. Of course, after Leylin had viciously beat up her &apos;flower guardian&apos; &#xA0;as a threat to her, this woman had become very silent.</p><p>However, she was still able to pass the magician aptitude test and enter the Wetland Gardens Academy.</p><p>&#x201C;Hi, Leylin.&#x201D; Bessita looked to be rather indifferent.</p><p>&#x201C;Come here! Leylin, let me introduce you. This is Alexander!&#x201D; George pointed at a youth with reddish-brown hair.</p><p>&#x201C;This here is Lana! And the beauty in pink clothing is our long distance attacker&#x2014; Shiera!&#x201D;</p><p>After that, George introduced the two female acolytes beside him. Lana was alright, but Sheira aggressively pinched the flesh on George&#x2019;s waist. He immediately let out exaggerated sounds of pain; it looked as if these two had a less innocent relationship.</p><p>Leylin couldn&#x2019;t help but glance at Sheila more closely. She wore pink hunter gear that exposed a pair of milky white thighs. She was tall and carried a green wooden bow, looking to be a good match with George.</p><p>Even Leylin had to admit that George had pretty good taste.</p><p>&#x201C;Leylin, why aren&#x2019;t you introducing your two friends here to us?&#x201D; After saying that, George mock punched Leylin&#x2019;s chest, which stunned him a little.</p><p>He looked at his own attire and then responded.</p><p>For the sake of convenience while travelling, Leylin and his two Grand Knights had on civilian clothing. After obtaining the old witch&#x2019;s spirit force compression method, he would also habitually conceal his energy waves, which indicated that he was an official Magus.</p><p>His two spiritually bound slaves were treated the same way.</p><p>Hence, George and the others, who were still acolytes, obviously were unable to discover Leylin&#x2019;s concealment and treated him as a regular acolyte.</p><p>&#x201C;These are my two friends. We met on the way and appeared to be going to the same place. They aren&#x2019;t very talkative and are a little antisocial!&#x201D;</p><p>Leylin threw a sculpture of a wyvern into Number 2 and Number 3&#x2019;s hands. &#x201C;Take this and leave first. We&#x2019;ll meet at our destination!&#x201D;</p><p>Upon receiving their master&#x2019;s secret instructions, Number 2 and Number 3 nodded and left on horseback.</p><p>&#x201C;Leylin, it&#x2019;s best if you&apos;re warier when interacting with them. I always feel uncomfortable around them&#x2026;&#x201D;</p><p>George looked at the figures of Number 2 and Number 3 as they left, and he whispered to Leylin.</p><p>&#x201C;Don&#x2019;t worry, I know my limits!&#x201D;</p><p>Leylin nodded.</p><p>&#x201C;Haha&#x2026; Let&#x2019;s not talk about this anymore. Leylin, we haven&apos;t met in six or seven years, huh? This time, we have to drink to our heart&#x2019;s content!&#x201D;</p><p>George naturally put an arm around Leylin&#x2019;s shoulder, and one could hear his excessive and proud laughter from miles away. &#x201C;Guess what? Two years ago, I advanced and became a level 3 acolyte! Even my mentor complimented me for this! But it&#x2019;s not much; it can&#x2019;t be helped that I only have a fourth-grade aptitude.&#x201D;</p><p>Due to this chance meeting, Leylin and George dispelled all thoughts of leaving the city and returned inside. They found a small bar and prepared to reminisce.</p><p>After two beers, Leylin had gleaned everything he wanted to know from George.</p><p>George was obviously still a student of Ennea Ivory Ring Tower, and so was his girlfriend, Sheira.</p><p>Bessita, Lana, and that guy called Alexander were all acolytes from the Wetland Gardens Academy.</p><p>The reason for their trip here was to complete missions issued by their respective academies. George and Bessita knew each other well, so the two little teams naturally travelled together.</p><p>&#x201C;We&#x2019;re in deep trouble. We were actually allocated a defence mission in which we must enter, as well as establish a presence in the Eternal River Plain&apos;s secret plane!&#x201D; George had a look of prolonged suffering on his face, and when they got to this topic, even Sheira and Bessita looked gloomy.</p><p>The secret plane was under the control of official Magi, and a few acolytes like them wouldn&#x2019;t be able to create a tiny disarray within. They were but cannon fodder, and could die at any time.</p><p>Leylin glanced at these people. In this group of five that had temporarily been banded together, George and Bessita were level 3 acolytes, and the other three had reached level 2. In general, their total power was similar to the group of five acolytes that he had destroyed outside the Zither Moon Town.</p><p>&#x201C;Oh, right! How about you, Leylin? Your aura seems pretty strong. You must be a level 3 acolyte, right?&#x201D;</p><p>George seemed to be asking without any intent. Bessita, who was using a straw to drink her beverage, visibly strained to hear his answer.</p><p>&#x201C;I was lucky enough to advance to a level 3 acolyte a few months ago!&#x201D; Leylin chuckled.</p><p>&#x201C;It&#x2019;s not easy to advance to a level 3 acolyte! Come! Let us drink to our future as Magi!&#x201D;</p><p>George hid none of his thoughts and yelled, attracting the attention of the surrounding people.</p><p>&#x201C;Cheers!&#x201D; Six glasses of beer clinked together.</p><p>After a bout of drinking, George asked, &#x201C;Leylin, where are you now? In the Abyssal Bone Forest Academy? Only after entering my academy did I find out that the Abyssal Bone Forest Academy was a dark Magus academy that was at odds with us. It&#x2019;s even forbidden for us to communicate with them.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;What? Abyssal Bone Forest?! That Abyssal Bone Forest Academy?&#x201D;</p><p>The moment the words came out of George&#x2019;s mouth, Lana and Alexander were like kittens who had had their tails stepped on, and jumped in shock.</p><p>Sheira didn&#x2019;t say anything, but the gaze in her eyes was more guarded when looking at Leylin.</p><p>&#x201C;Alright! Alright! Don&#x2019;t be this tense! Leylin and I are good friends; he is different from other dark Magi...&#x201D;</p><p>Only then did George realise the slip of his tongue, as he stood and awkwardly gave a closure on the topic.</p><p></p><hr><p></p>
