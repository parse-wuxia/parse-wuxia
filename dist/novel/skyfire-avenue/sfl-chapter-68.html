He did not react to the Accountant&#x2019;s malfeasance. However, as they turned to leave the Gourmet&#x2019;s small apartment a tendril of lightning snaked soundlessly along the ground under the Accountant&#x2019;s feet. Every hair on is body stood on end.</p><p>&#x201C;This wont happen again. Otherwise, I&#x2019;ll throw you out of the Avenue myself.&#x201D; The Wine Master had also stood, staring daggers at the offender as he spoke. He left on Lan Jue&#x2019;s heels.</p><p>The Accountant opened his mouth, and a tendril of smoke slithered from between his lips. The muscles of his face twitched uncontrollably. &#x201C;You have to believe me, I was just having some fun! I didn&#x2019;t mean anything by it.&#x201D;</p><p>The Mechanist reached out and grabbed the Accountant by the throat. &#x201C;It&#x2019;s because I believe you that I want to beat you even worse.&#x201D;</p><p>The Gourmet interjected gently. &#x201C;Were it not be a waste of my food, I&#x2019;d beat you myself until you threw it all back up. You better think up some way to make it up to the Jewelry Master.&#x201D;</p><p>The sky had grown dark in the interim. The Avenue was lit only by the lights of the shops that lined it&#x2019;s sides, and though not bright it added to the rustic charm of the Avenue&#x2019;s antique construction.</p><p>Lan Jue walked in silence, Zhou Qianlin a step behind.</p><p>&#x201C;Are you angry?&#x201D;</p><p>Lan Jue shook his head. &#x201C;The guy&#x2019;s just that way, he didn&#x2019;t do it to hurt me specifically. It&#x2019;s not really worth getting angry with him over. I&#x2019;m just thinking of other things.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Oh?&#x201D; Zhou Qianlin watched him carefully.</p><p>Lan Jue stopped and turned to face Zhou Qianlin. &#x201C;I&#x2019;m sorry,&#x201D; he muttered.</p><p>&#x201C;What?&#x201D; Her confusion only grew.</p><p>&#x201C;You&#x2019;re so like her that in my mind, at certain times I forget you aren&#x2019;t. It&#x2019;s wrong, Hera is the only one in my heart. You aren&#x2019;t her replica, not her replacement. And so, I apologize. In the future I&#x2019;ll be only your bodyguard. After these three years, when my contract ends, we&#x2019;ll part ways and have no more contact.&#x201D;</p><p>Lan Jue&#x2019;s voice was distant, detached. As he spoke, even he himself felt he probably went too far.</p><p>But he had no choice. Ke&#x2019;er&#x2019;s words had woken him up. Had Zhou Qianlin not begun to replace Hera, at least in his mind, would he have agreed to three years as a bodyguard? Would he have become an instructor at a university? And he even brought her to the Avenue, to participate in this special meal. All of this together meant only one thing; she had begun to mean something to him.</p><p>The wondrous flavors of the meal still dominated his taste buds, but in spite of their valiant efforts he couldn&#x2019;t shake these thoughts. Zhou Qianlin wasn&#x2019;t his Hera. His Hera was gone. Logic told him he mustn&#x2019;t continue, else one day Zhou Qianlin replace Hera as his most beloved.</p><p>It was best to deal with something like this in the beginning. The longer he let it be, the harder it would become to do the right thing.</p><p>So he had no recourse but to speak up.</p><p>Zhou Qianlin looked at him, speechless. There was no change in the expression of her pretty face. But her eyes couldn&#x2019;t conceal everything, and the secrets were hidden there.</p><p>She gave him a long, piercing stare. Her deep green eyes were deep, as though capable of drinking his soul in to their depths. Under that heavy gaze, Lan Jue&#x2019;s heart couldn&#x2019;t help but skip a beat. He felt the pang in his chest, though it was not solely from her look.</p><p>&#x201C;Qianlin, you&#x2019;re a nice girl. I know what I said hurt you, but&#x2026;&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Fine.&#x201D; She replied softly.</p><p>She followed that with a burst of pretty, tintinnabular laughter.</p><p>&#x201C;Are&#x2026;&#x201D; Lan Jue looked at her, dumbfounded. &#x201C;Are you alright?&#x201D;</p><p>Zhou Qianlin shook her head. &#x201C;You men. You think all women under the sky just love you. Surely you don&#x2019;t think I felt something for you?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;&#x2026;&#x201D;</p><p>Zhou Qianlin&#x2019;s hard gaze kept him pinned. &#x201C;If you think I like you, or you&#x2019;re afraid I&#x2019;ll like you sometime in the future, then you have nothing to worry about. You took my body, which means I&#x2019;ll have to remember you for the rest of my life, but when I do it will be in regret. You said it, you&#x2019;re just my bodyguard and nothing more. I&#x2019;ve never thought of you as anything more. Don&#x2019;t think of yourself as someone special, got it? This dinner was nice, now send me home.&#x201D;</p><p>The words still hung in the air as she turned to leave, a small smile on her face.</p><p>Lan Jue stood in place, frozen for a good few seconds. Eventually he began to follow.</p><p>Her face was calm, revealing nothing. But deep in her eyes lived something strange, fluctuating. There was gratification, regret, pain, and something unexplainable that flowed within her.</p><p>The entire way back to her mountaintop home was spent in silence.</p><p>&#x201C;Alright, here&#x2019;s fine.&#x201D; Zhou Qianlin stopped and smiled towards Lan Jue as she spoke.</p><p>&#x201C;Right,&#x201D; he said, nodding his head.</p><p>&#x201C;You&#x2019;re heading out tomorrow, be careful. Oh, by the way, so you don&#x2019;t misunderstand let me make this clear. I do not care for you, I say this so that you make sure to come back ready to act effectively as my bodyguard.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;I will.&#x201D; He nodded again.</p><p>&#x201C;Goodbye.&#x201D; She waved a hand, and left without saying anything else.</p><p>Lan Jue watched her leave, unmoving. After a moment he snorted, and strode away.</p><p>He cast the experience away as though it were nothing. Still, for reasons he didn&#x2019;t understand, a dull ache still remained in his chest.</p><p>Zhou Qianlin went directly to her room and sat on the bed. Her face betrayed no emotion, but after a good while a bitterness crept in, and tears began to flow uncontrollably from the corner of her eyes. She made no sound, and the tears rolled down her smooth, white skin unhindered.</p><p></p><p style="text-align: center">&#x3B6;</p><p></p><p>Skyfire Avenue was as silent as ever. At night there never were very many stragglers on the street. The darkness had grown, but Lan Jue&#x2019;s mood had improved as he moved down the chilly street.</p><p>&#x201C;Come to me,&#x201D; a deep voice intruded in his ear. He jumped slightly from the unexpected sound, then turned towards the Gothic Winery.</p><p>&#x201C;You aren&#x2019;t calling me here to apologize on behalf the Accountant, are you?&#x201D; Lan Jue sat beside the Wine Master, smirking.</p><p>The Wine Master&#x2019;s face betrayed a rare smile. &#x201C;Your current mood isn&#x2019;t due to what he did. There&#x2019;s no reason to bother with him. The guy is a clown. No, it&#x2019;s because of the girl you brought tonight. Am I right?&#x201D;</p><p>Lan Jue looked at his old friend. &#x201C;It&#x2019;s done.&#x201D;</p><p>The Wine Master gave a wry chuckle. &#x201C;If it&#x2019;s done you don&#x2019;t need to tell me so. You&#x2019;re an adult. I&#x2019;m not your father.&#x201D;</p><p>Lan Jue&#x2019;s face grew hard. &#x201C;Why&#x2019;d you call me here.&#x201D;</p><p>The Wine Master smiled. &#x201C;Blind taste check. Let&#x2019;s see if you&#x2019;re still as sharp as you used to be.&#x201D;</p><p></p><hr><p></p>
