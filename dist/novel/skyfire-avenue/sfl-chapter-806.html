<p></p><p style="text-align: center"><b>Chapter 806: Satan&#x2019;s Last Words</b></p><p></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Spit it out!&#x201D; The Terminator said between world-shaking punches. Satan was sacrificing his life so that the rest of them might live. How could he ignore his request?</span></p><p><span style="">Satan&#x2019;s voice was low and solemn. &#x201C;</span><i><span style="">If my daughter decides to take over the Dark Citadel, I want you to support her claim. If she refuses let the Hades bloodline take control. I bequeath my demonic blade to my last remaining daughter. I trust you, and I trust the Avenue, but I will place no faith in that snake the Pontiff. Keep Mika safe.&#x201D;</span></i></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Alright!&#x201D; The Terminator agreed without hesitation. Sorrow flitted through his eyes.</span></p><p><span style="">For a hundred years the number of Paragons in the world had remained constant. Only within the last year or so were new names added to the list. Both of them were old established heroes of a bygone era. To witness his contemporary&#x2019; life cut short in this way, the Terminator was filled with admiration.</span></p><p><span style="">Every Paragon had some extreme measure hidden away in case of events such as this, but they also had misgivings. The Terminator, for instance, couldn&#x2019;t sacrifice himself because the North needed him. If he were to fall the North would have no one to contend against the daunting power of the East.</span></p><p><span style="">Satan&#x2019;s courage was as surprising as it was praiseworthy.</span></p><p><span style="">Satan chuckled. His right hand lifted and pointed toward the heavens. &#x201C;</span><i><span style="">Go!</span></i><span style="">&#x201D; He roared.</span></p><p><span style="">The area of smoldering red around him suddenly became a tornado of energy that swallowed up the Paragons and spat them into the air. Demonic flames lapped at their heels and burned so intensely they kept the alien avatars at bay.</span></p><p><span style="">The fires began to consume Satan&#x2019;s body. His powers hovered on the cusp of the Infinite.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;</span><i><span style="">So this is what the Infinite feels like, the power I was meant to command.&#x201D;</span></i><span style=""> Satan stepped forward into the center of the tornado. If he remained within it and left with the others there was a chance he could survive. But he was the King of Devils &#x2013; he sought a glorious death in combat.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;</span><i><span style="">Come! Children of the alien fiends. I will show you the power of a real monster.</span></i><span style="">&#x201D; He swiped his rapier through the air, sending waves of crimson energy in all directions.</span></p><p><span style="">Monarch&#x2019;s doppelganger retreated a step and lifted its hands. An orb of violet light issued from its palms and burned away the encroaching attack. Queen and Consort came closing in on Satan&#x2019;s location from either flank.</span></p><p><span style="">Satan watched them come with fearless countenance, ready to face them alone. The hellfire that clung to him flickered dangerously and burned brighter. The avatars were reluctant to get close, for they knew the heat from those fires could scorch them down to their souls.</span></p><p><span style="">The red tornado had flung the other six Paragons with such force they were in the upper reaches of the planet&#x2019;s atmosphere before they knew it. Many lesser aliens had rushed after them, but of course could not block their escape.</span></p><p><span style="">The Terminator&#x2019;s expression was uncharacteristically angry. As he flew at the head of the group his big hands grabbed whatever beasts dared get to close before ripping the life out of them in grotesque fashion. It was the only way he could release the pain and resentment that ate at his heart.</span></p><p><span style="">The other Paragons didn&#x2019;t utter a sound, but similar feelings were clear on their faces.</span></p><p><span style="">The Wine Master, Clockmaker, Keeper and Bookworm were all glowering. Skyfire Avenue adhered to a strict code of fairness and justice. The Keeper had been prepared to use his own power of last resort, but Satan had been faster. </span></p><p><span style="">Even the Pontiff&#x2019;s face betrayed a sense of loss, almost disbelief. He would never have suspected Satan to take this measure. As an emissary of God it should have been his responsibility! But he didn&#x2019;t have the courage his contemporary had.</span></p><p><span style="">The Paragons slaughtered their way out of encirclement, eventually fighting their way out into space. Once they had some breathing room the Wine Master waved his scepter and a silver light enveloped them. When it receded they were far from the planet&#x2019;s surface. Without the doppelgangers the aliens couldn&#x2019;t prevent them from escaping.</span></p><p><span style="">Just then a streak of light arrived, a beam that was there one minute and gone the next as it swept through the pursuing alien force. A bone-jarring explosion ensued that sent the monsters reeling in all directions. Zeus-1 appeared suspended in the darkness nearby.</span></p><p><span style="">The Wine Master dare not delay. Waving his scepter again his protogenia conveyed them into the small ship&#x2019;s interior. Immediately Zeus-1&#x2019;s Blinding Stone was reengaged and Lin Guoguo concealed their presence with her psychic force. They peeled off to evade their enemy&#x2019;s search.</span></p><p><span style="">Zeus-1 was nearing its limit. It had been working beyond capacity the whole way to Heaven&#x2019;s Light, a feat only possible because Lan Jue was feeding it energy. When they returned to the fleet his ship would need serious repairs.</span></p><p><span style="">When he saw the group of Paragons appear on the bridge Lan Jue&#x2019;s first reaction was to sigh in relief. He made it in time to save them. But his satisfaction was brief, for soon he saw the problem. They were short one.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Where is he?&#x201D; Lan Jue had noticed it immediately, and so had Mika. She had approached the moment they appeared. There was a tremble in her voice.</span></p><p><span style="">It was the Terminator who answered her. &#x201C;In order to save our lives Satan pierced his own heart with his demon blade. He used the King of Devils true power to cover our retreat&#x2026;&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What?&#x201D; For a moment Mika&#x2019;s eyes went dark. She felt faint.</span></p><p><span style="">For years she had hated Satan, withholding forgiveness for his alleged crimes. But, in her heart he was always undefeatable &#x2013; an indomitable force that could overcome all obstacles. Like all little girls she believed her dad could conquer the universe. He was the Devil of this generation.</span></p><p><span style="">Now they were telling her that this man, this indestructible force of nature, the man she&#x2019;d despised for so long, was&#x2026;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Mika, don&#x2019;t rush to conclusions. Let&#x2019;s take a look, maybe there&#x2019;s something we can do.&#x201D; Lan Jue had come to her side, helping to keep her steady.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Lan Jue you mustn&#x2019;t rush in!&#x201D; The Wine Master warned.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;With our gathered strength we can escape unscathed,&#x201D; Lan Jue said. &#x201C;My mother has risen to the Infinite.&#x201D; His own eyes sparkled as he allowed his aura to be revealed to them.</span></p><p><span style="">Surprise appeared on their faces as Lan Jue&#x2019;s aura washed over them. &#x201C;You broke through?&#x201D; The Terminator asked.</span></p><p><span style="">The Paragons of Skyfire Avenue were aware, but the other were not.</span></p><p><span style="">Lan Jue nodded. He then turned back to Mika. &#x201C;Pull yourself together.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Mika was tough. She grit her teeth and nodded.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;The target for this planet still remains, we need to make sure it gets done. Let&#x2019;s go.&#x201D; Luo Xianni&#x2019;s stoic voice intruded. With a wave of her hand, all the Paragon aboard Zeus-1 vanished.</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p>
