<p></p><p style="text-align: center"><b>Chapter 626: Prying</b></p><p></p><p><span style="">Jue Di shook his head. &#x201C;We&#x2019;re on different levels, it has limited use for me. I would need crystals from something as strong as I. It&#x2019;s the same for you. Those Paragons in the Realm of Protogenia, or who are Reflections of Heaven and Earth, they can use them. But for those like you and me, we&#x2019;ve already surpassed natural restrictions and are connected to the universe at large. Only creatures with a similar connection can supplement our energies.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">A faint, bloodthirsty light shone in Luo Xianni&#x2019;s eyes. &#x201C;Then we&#x2019;ll search until we find that alien, something that&#x2019;ll work for us!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Jue Di nodded. &#x201C;This is also one reason I wanted to come along. If such a chance exists, I&#x2019;m not going to let it slip.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">When she heard his affirmation, her mood improved. &#x201C;You will definitely succeed,&#x201D; she said through a smile. &#x201C;You&#x2019;re invincible.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Zeus-1 took a distant, circuitous route from the scene of their last battle before continuing toward the galaxy&#x2019;s center. The last encounter had left them flush, so much in fact that the Wine Master was having trouble keeping calm.</span></p><p><span style="">Altogether they&#x2019;d gathered one thousand seven hundred vital crystals. Among them was the ten-meter long one from the Basilisk. If they managed to bring all of these back to human worlds intact, the response would be overwhelming. The cost to create their teleport base paled in comparison. They would be the cornerstone of the Eastern Alliance&#x2019;s future dominance!</span></p><p><span style="">After preliminary calculations by the Accountant they estimated more than ten thousand people could use these to extend their lives, if the energy they released was any indication. This was on the conservative side, even before considering the Basilisk crystal.</span></p><p><span style="">The asteroid belts were beginning to look familiar. More and more aliens were appearing on their radar. However, now that they were closer to the planets he didn&#x2019;t engage. Scouting was the main priority at the moment, seek and destroy only if they had time.</span></p><p><span style="">They relied on Lin Guoguo&#x2019;s psychic pulses to keep them hidden when an alien came too close. She&#x2019;d become quite adroit at mimicking alien consciousness after so many days of practice.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;We&#x2019;ll nearly be there once we cross the asteroid field.&#x201D; Su Xiaosu&#x2019;s somewhat nervous voice called to Lan Jue.</span></p><p><span style="">He walked over to her side and looked over her shoulder at the radar. Sadly its scanning range was soiled by the chaotic energies and magnetic disturbances of the Shattered Starfields. They couldn&#x2019;t see much beyond the tips of their noses.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Wine Master, prepare to evacuate us at a moment&#x2019;s notice.&#x201D; Lan Jue said.</span></p><p><span style="">The Wine Master nodded. His dimensional scepter was already in his hand. The Epochrion and the Taming Dragon Arhat were in their respective cabins, preparing for a fight.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Guoguo, how long can you keep this up?&#x201D; He looked her way.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;At least an hour with no problems,&#x201D; she answered.</span></p><p><span style="">He nodded. &#x201C;Full speed ahead. Accountant, make sure all our scanning equipment is ready to go.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Aye aye!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Zeus-1 leapt forward, barreling over a large asteroid on its way to clear space &#x2013; and its target, the three alien planets.</span></p><p><span style="">At top speed it didn&#x2019;t take them long to traverse the belt. As the last space rock rolled past, the rest of the galaxy was revealed. At last, they&#x2019;d reached their destination.</span></p><p><span style="">Except, everything was not what they expected. When they arrived at where the three primary planets had been, only one planet remained, hovering in the spot Moonfiend had once occupied. The other two were gone, with no trace left behind.</span></p><p><span style="">Xiaosu gasped. &#x201C;They&#x2019;ve already teleported away?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Lan Jue placed a hand on her shoulder. &#x201C;Not necessarily, don&#x2019;t panic. Move in closer and scan the area. Remember that these planets can move. Maybe the planets split up to cover more area. After all, out here even one of these planets are invincible. Let&#x2019;s move in and take a look. Mika, call my parents here to look. Assuming only one of the planets are here, maybe we can cause a little chaos.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Jue Di&#x2019;s apocalyptic punch had stunned everyone, and was a font of courage for Lan Jue. If his father could put down one of these three fatal worlds, it could mean the difference in humanity&#x2019;s coming crisis.</span></p><p><span style="">Mika rushed to fetch them, while Zeus-1 slowly crept closer. The Psychic Tide continued to put her full effort into maintaining their camouflage.</span></p><p><span style="">From afar the planet almost looked like a human Bastion Ship, floating quietly by itself. A hive would be a more apt description, though. Scores of alien creatures could be spied leaving and returning from its surface. It swallowed them up and spat out others, keeping the flow steady.</span></p><p><span style="">Undoubtedly the creatures were being dispatched to gather more life energy. When they returned, they delivered that energy to the planet itself.</span></p><p><span style="">It was the first time Lan Jue was close enough to see the process clearly.</span></p><p><span style="">The surface of the planet was entirely purple. Its surface was pockmarked with craters, mountains, and strange fold-like valleys. A pale purple haze surrounded it, like an atmosphere. That was all he could tell with his eyes alone. He couldn&#x2019;t see or sense much beyond that.</span></p><p><span style="">Jue Di and Luo Xianni arrived at the bridge and walked to his side. They looked out at the scene.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Just one?&#x201D; Jue Di&#x2019;s brows wrinkled in thought.</span></p><p><span style="">Lan Jue nodded. &#x201C;We can only see one. The other two most likely moved on. Now we know they can move and fight separately.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Jue Di&#x2019;s eyes narrowed. He was thinking of something, but there was no telling what.</span></p><p><span style="">Lan Jue continued. &#x201C;From our previous encounter we can determine that these planets are living creatures. They&#x2019;re like brood mothers, and can spawn aliens for their needs. They use life energy pilfered from elsewhere to empower themselves. The one we found on Taihua, the one we called a progenitor, was essentially a scaled-down version of this thing. It also spawned aliens and sent them out to drain the planet. It was using that energy to get bigger. We suspect that&#x2019;s how these things develop.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Jue Di nodded, expressing his agreement.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Father, we have no way of telling how strong this planet is. If you were to fight it, do you think you could cause some damage?&#x201D; Lan Jue asked.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Absolutely not!&#x201D; Luo Xianni answered for him.</span></p><p><span style="">Lan Jue paused. Everyone&#x2019;s eyes turned her way.</span></p><p><span style="">Jue Di stared at her for a moment before answering. &#x201C;I can&#x2019;t tell. The planet&#x2019;s atmosphere is hiding its energies from me. I&#x2019;d need to get in there.&#x201D;</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p>
