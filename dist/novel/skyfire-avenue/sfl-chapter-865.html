Li Ke addressed them once again. &#x201C;Now we will use the alien methods to increase your strength. Once you have achieved Nirvana I will pass on Ultus&#x2019; lineage to Lan Qing.

The Pharmacist looked on with sorrowful eyes. Li Ke said the words lightly, but she knew that once he passed the inheritance to Lan Qing her husband would be gone. Already it was clear to everyone that Li Ke&#x2019;s spirit had begun to fade. It seemed he could vanish at any moment.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lan Jue looked between the two. &#x201C;We will watch over you.

You&#x2019;ve helped remedy that. Thank you. I chose not to reveal myself to Jun&#x2019;er because she already has a father &#x2013; you. Don&#x2019;t misunderstand, my meaning is that you are far more qualified to guider her as a father than I. I have already failed her too much, and I don&#x2019;t wish to negatively influence her life any more than I have.&#x201D;</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lan Jue&#x2019;s surprise was palpable.

Were it not for the misfortunes they&#x2019;d suffered this man would have lived to be a modern luminary.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&#x201C;However&#x2026;&#x201D; Li Ke hesitated, then dropped his head. &#x201C;I have to trouble you with a request.

Since he refers to the Pharmacist as sister. This is actually more familiar than &#x2018;Brother Li&#x2019;.]. I must ask, do you really believe Jun&#x2019;er doesn&#x2019;t understand what&#x2019;s happening? She may be young, but that girl has more wisdom than most adults. That&#x2019;s even before you consider her inheritance from the Clairvoyant. She knows, she just hasn&#x2019;t said anything. She doesn&#x2019;t want to heart you&#x2026; or perhaps it&#x2019;s to protect herself.&#x201D;</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Both Li Ke and the Pharmacist shook at his words.

She couldn&#x2019;t help but feel like she&#x2019;d been neglectful of the girl lately. Lan Jue seemed to know her better.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lan Jue looked from one to the other. &#x201C;I feel sorry for Jun&#x2019;er, but she&#x2019;s more mature than you give her credit for. You&#x2019;ve been living in your own world, but I think you need to ask her what she thinks. Brother, you don&#x2019;t want to speak with her because you&#x2019;re afraid to cause her pain. But if she knows her father&#x2019;s back, and you say nothing, what sort of damage do you think that will cause? I hope you both speak with her. It may hurt, but at the very least she&#x2019;ll have the memory of her real dad. She&#x2019;ll remember that her father really did come back. At least for a moment your family was whole.&#x201D;</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&#x201C;Of course I&#x2019;ll always be a father to her, that won&#x2019;t ever change.

He simply turned and left to fetch Jun&#x2019;er. Whatever Li Ke&#x2019;s decision he would bring her here so they could be face to face. They were, after all, family.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When Lan Jue returned, holding Jun&#x2019;er in his arms, there were several more people in the sitting room.

She would be the one to strip Lan Qing and the Pharmacist of their memories, so the secrets of the transmutation technique would be lost forever. There was no stronger Adept than Lin Guoguo in the realm of psychic power.&#xA0;</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xiuxiu and Ke&#x2019;er had come with her.

Her big eyes were dull and sightless, but beautiful nonetheless. They were like windows into an endless universe. In her hands she bore the Eye of Tomorrow, the crystal ball the Clairvoyant once used to influence the flows of human destiny.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When he saw her Li Ke&#x2019;s spirit floated forward, but stopped ten meters from where Lan Jue stood. The three amazons jumped when he did, unaware of what was happening.

Lan Jue took it from her, and in his hands it looked like a perfectly normal glass bauble.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&#x201C;Daddy&#x2026; come!&#x201D; Jun&#x2019;er called out again, but when Lan Jue looked toward her, the young girl&#x2019;s hand wasn&#x2019;t stretched toward him. One hand held tightly to the Pharmacist&#x2019;s, while the other reached for Li Ke.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This touching moment struck everyone, filling their hearts.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Li Ke looked at his daughter, not daring to believe.

He knew he was a spirit and could not touch his daughter, but he threw open his arms anyway and tried to hug her. Everyone&#x2019;s eyes were wet with tears. For a father to be unable to hold his daughter, the sorrow of it was unspeakable.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Jun&#x2019;er&#x2019;s placid face bore a faint smile and she opened her own arms to accept him.
