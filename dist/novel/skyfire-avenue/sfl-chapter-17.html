<p></p><p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 17: Let Me Be Your Antidote</strong></p><p></p><p>The mecha towered twenty three meters, shimmering a brilliant sapphire blue. From shoulder to shoulder it stretched eight meters, with a tall and slender figure. It&#x2019;s shoulder plates were three affixed layers; the topmost was the largest with spikes which rose skyward, the middle layer was smooth and slightly smaller than the first, and the third layer retracted into the joint.</p><p>It&#x2019;s texture was markedly different from average mechas. It was as though it was carved from a single piece of true sapphire, a work of art. As the armor tapered towards it&#x2019;s edges the color became a metallic purple. As lightning flashed in the sky above, the light from the blasts reflected magnificently off of the armor. In the instant it&#x2019;s chest plate closed, it emitted a burst of intense violet light. It grew until it was as a ball of violet lightning rising in to the sky, vanishing in to the forest of arcing bolts above.</p><p>&#x201C;That... that was...&#x201D;</p><p>The golden mecha had already steadied itself where it had been left in the air. The blond-haired, green-eyed woman in the cockpit filled with a shock that was difficult to describe.</p><p>&#x201C;Thor. That was Thor. I actually <em>met</em> Thor. Thor&#x2026; Zeus? Was that Zeus? I actually&#x2026; actually told Zeus that the stronger his discipline, the more he&#x2019;d bow to my mecha? The Zeus who, by virtue of his Discipline alone, bested thirteen top-grade customized mechas!&#x201D;</p><p>The stars shimmered in her eyes, as though she&#x2019;d already forgotten all about the abduction.</p><p>She hovered stupefied for a long while, then again began to mutter to herself. &#x201C;Why didn&#x2019;t he take <em>me</em> away?&#x201D;</p><p></p><p style="text-align: center;">&#x3B6;</p><p></p><p>Thor had risen with stunning speed, the upper atmosphere rolling past it like water off a duck&#x2019;s back. In minutes it was floating in the vast, quiet expanse of space.</p><p>No radar in operation was capable of locating Thor. The special composition of it&#x2019;s armor was legendary in the world of Mecha-Pilots.</p><p>The cabin within Thor was somewhat larger than average, but was a little cramped accommodating two people.</p><p>Zeus withdrew the mask, revealing his long and handsome face. Only in this moment, he found it impossible to retain his traditional calm.</p><p>In this moment he wasn&#x2019;t Zeus. He was Lan Jue.</p><p>He hugged his arms tightly around the woman in his embrace, as though afraid she would vanish.</p><p>&#x201C;Jin Yu, we&#x2019;re finally together again. Why&#x2026; why didn&#x2019;t you come looking for me? You&#x2019;re my Hera!&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;I&#x2019;m so hot.&#x201D; Locked in his tight embrace, abducted, this was the first thing Zhou Qianlin thought to say.</p><p>&#x201C;Huh?&#x201D; Lan Jue paused, lifting a hand to press against her forehead.</p><p>Zhou Qianlin&#x2019;s forehead was burning up, and her eyes had shut. Her brows were furrowed, and her body trembled slightly.</p><p>She had a fever?</p><p>Lan Jue&#x2019;s face grew somber, noticing the red flesh of her neck. She was sick, and those people wanted her to suffer through a marriage?</p><p>Lifting his head, Lan Jue muttered, &#x201C;Thor, take us home.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Affirmative, returning home.&#x201D; The gentle, dignified voice reverberated through the cockpit. Thor began to transform, to wings extending from it&#x2019;s back. Then, like a bolt of lightning, it shot in to the darkness of the universe.</p><p></p><p style="text-align: center;">&#x3B6;</p><p></p><p>Zeus&#x2019; Jewelry Store.</p><p>Ke&apos;er was bored to tears, listlessly laying atop the bar.</p><p>Xiuxiu sat to the side, idly sipping the cup of warm water in her hands.</p><p>The jewelry shop rarely had visitors, a common reality on Skyfire Avenue. But even if there were only one or two customers, it was usually sufficient to keep the shop running.</p><p>&#x201C;Hey Xiuxiu, where&#x2019;d the boss go? Didn&#x2019;t see him yesterday, still not here today.&#x201D; Ke&apos;er cantered her head towards Xiuxiu and whined.</p><p>Xiuxiu laughed. &#x201C;The boss is a very important man. You think he&#x2019;d just vanish? Don&#x2019;t be such a nosy little thing!&#x201D;</p><p>Ke&apos;er giggled. &#x201C;Me? Don&#x2019;t tell me you aren&#x2019;t curious what he&#x2019;s doing. You came so early this morning, without waiting for me to come help. You even cleaned his house!&#x201D;</p><p>Xiuxiu&#x2019;s face grew red, as though she&#x2019;d smeared it with rouge, adding even more charm to her classical beauty.</p><p>Just then, the earth shook beneath Zeus&#x2019; Jewelry Store.</p><p>The girls exchanged glances. &#x201C;Speak of the devil,&#x201D; Ke&apos;er exclaimed. &#x201C;The boss must be back, I&#x2019;ll go check.&#x201D;</p><p>As she said this, she skipped towards the VIP lounge.</p><p>As she pushed to open the door, however, she was surprised to find it wouldn&#x2019;t budge.</p><p>&#x201C;Xiuxiu, Ke&apos;er, I&#x2019;m a little tired. I&#x2019;m going to rest for a while,&#x201D; Lan Jue&#x2019;s voice crackled through the speaker by the door.</p><p>&#x201C;Eh?&#x201D; Ke&apos;er stood confused by the door, while Xiuxiu also drew near.</p><p>Ke&apos;er turned to look at Xiuxiu. &#x201C;The boss doesn&#x2019;t sound quite right. Maybe he snuck a woman in, and is afraid we&#x2019;d find out&#x2026;&#x201D;</p><p>Xiuxiu lifted her hand and rapped against Ke&apos;er&#x2019;s head in agitation. &#x201C;What are you saying. In three years, have you even <em>once</em>&#x2026;&#x201D; She trailed off, a dismal look in her eyes. &#x201C;I-If he really did bring a woman back, then I&#x2019;m happy for him.&#x201D;</p><p>Ke&apos;er closed her mouth, and said nothing more.</p><p></p><p style="text-align: center;">&#x3B6;</p><p></p><p>Lan Jue carefully laid Zhou Qianlin atop his bed. Even in her state, she was still breathtakingly beautiful.</p><p>His brows furrowed in thought. Not half an hour since he discovered her illness and her temperature had already risen sharply. He&#x2019;d used Thor&#x2019;s onboard diagnostics to run a scan, but discovered no sickness or poison. It was a drug, one that could trigger desire in the victim.</p><p>Why? Why today, as a bride, would she need this sort of drug? Judging by the progress of her reaction, it was meant to last until the wedding had concluded.</p><p><em>Those wretches! Was this wedding forced by the Austins? They DARE to force this drug on my Hera. </em></p><p>A thin hand softly rested atop his own, it&#x2019;s heat and soft touch drawing him from his rage.</p><p>Zhou Qianlin&#x2019;s body had grown red, and her body began to writhe.</p><p>It was a fierce, powerful drug.</p><p>Leaning down, he gently took her up in his arms. He felt the heat radiating from her, could smell the familiar scent of her body.</p><p>Softly he whispered in her ear. &#x201C;My Hera. In this life, you are destined to be my bride, and mine alone. Let me be your antidote.&#x201D;</p><p></p><hr><p></p>
