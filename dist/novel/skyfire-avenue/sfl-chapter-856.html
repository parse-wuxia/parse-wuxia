The white light of her Domain spread out and enveloped it. Lan Jue immediately stepped behind her and placed his hands on her back, lending his power to hers. Though their Disciplines were different, Lan Jue&#x2019;s help amplified both their abilities by several times.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Under the light of the Queen of Heaven the Paragons felt their exhaustion melt away.

Father had reached the pinnacle of humanity long ago. In a way he&#x2019;s learned to evade universal protogenia, like the home worlds did by becoming planets. He had his own method, specifically this staff. It has a way to hide him from the universe. Father sacrificed himself, certainly, but he put his essence &#x2013; his soul &#x2013; into the Compliance Rod. I can feel him clearly, he&#x2019;s in there.&#x201D;</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Luo Xianni&#x2019;s words were growing more desperate. &#x201C;Is there a way to bring him back?&#x201D;</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She knew what it meant to speak of an Adept&#x2019;s soul. So long as her husband&#x2019;s will remained there remained a chance. Only, even she had been unable to sense him in the staff.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qianlin explained. &#x201C;Father sealed himself away deep within the weapon. He had to, otherwise universal protogenia would still be able to find him. I was only able to sense him because my Domain isolated us from the threat.&#x201D;</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Pharmacist was the next to speak up. &#x201C;There is a precedent. In the ancient days immortals were somewhat of a misnomer. Their lives were limited, but lifespans stretched for thousands of years. Three thousand years was typical, I believe &#x2013; of course, assuming they were protected in an immortal realm. Just as Qianlin said, like the aliens his Majesty Jue Di could have found a way to hide himself from universal protogenia. That should mean there&#x2019;s a chance to bring him back. Once one achieves immortality reforming a physical body shouldn&#x2019;t be too difficult. However I imagine it would require a tremendous amount of vital energy. The only way to withstand the power of universal protogenia is to have enough power to match it.&#x201D;</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhou Qianlin nodded in agreement. &#x201C;I had the same thought, and gathering that vital energy shouldn&#x2019;t be a problem. In fact we just killed an Infinite-level alien and recovered its crystal. The real problem now is that we aren&#x2019;t strong enough to contend with universal protogenia. Perhaps, when I break through to the Infinite, we can try.&#x201D;</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hearing them discuss the possibility helped Luo Xianni shed her grief. She had experienced the mysteries of Qianlin&#x2019;s power herself, even going so far as to rely on it to rise to the Infinite. So far it had protected her reliably from the wrath of the universe.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&#x201C;It would be a miracle if you could bring their father back. Qianlin, thank you. Without you we wouldn&#x2019;t have known his soul remained, much less have a hope of bringing him back.&#x201D;</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lan Jue and Lan Qing openly gaped, and how could they not? Their father was not wholly dead, and there existed a chance to bring him back. They&#x2019;d found fortune in the midst of tragedy.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lan Jue&#x2019;s eyes almost unconsciously turned toward the Pharmacist. &#x201C;Sister, if we can do this with Father, could your husband&#x2026;?&#x201D;</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Pharmacist&#x2019;s face bore signs of sadness as she lifted her head, and sorrowfully stared at Ultus.</span></p>
