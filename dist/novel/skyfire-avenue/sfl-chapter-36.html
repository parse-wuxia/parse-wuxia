<p></p><p style="text-align: center">&#xA0;<strong>Chapter 36: You don&#x2019;t get capital punishment for annoying someone to death, right?</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>&#xA0;</strong></p><p>&#x201C;Two things,&#x201D; the Keeper rejoined. &#x201C;Go on.&#x201D;</p><p>He handed the box in his hands to the old man. &#x201C;This is a power gem I&#x2019;ve recently acquired. It emits a rather powerful radiation, and after some investigation I found that it&#x2019;s internal power of compression is A-ranked. But this gem isn&#x2019;t in any record. You are the wisest man on Skyfire Avenue. I was hoping you could offer some insight.&#x201D;</p><p>The Keeper took the box in his hands and opened it without hesitation. A faint light pulsed from the box, shimmered, and then ceased completely.</p><p>The Keeper relieved the box of the gem and examined it closely. After a moment had passed, he frowned. &#x201C;If you aren&#x2019;t in a hurry I suggest you leave it here. I&#x2019;ll examine it more closely. It&#x2019;s nothing like I&#x2019;ve seen before.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Sure,&#x201D; Lan Jue responded without hesitation. After all, the Keeper didn&#x2019;t simply sell books. He was also an accomplished scientists, and the stone had clearly piqued his interest.</p><p>&#x201C;And the second matter,&#x201D; the Keeper inquired, replacing the stone and setting the box absently upon the tea table.</p><p>Lan Jue began, &#x201C;I remember you have a good relationship with the greatest schools of Three Alliances. Do you happen to be familiar with the National Eastern University?&#x201D;</p><p>The Keeper shot him a glance. &#x201C;What. Are you planning to get your doctorate? Don&#x2019;t bother, you can&#x2019;t teach an old dog new tricks &#x2013; and they have nothing to teach you anyway! Hehehe.&#x201D;</p><p>Lan Jue&#x2019; face scrunched in exasperation. <em>This old guy, just a few Alpacas short of a herd.</em></p><p>&#x201C;Well you&#x2019;re not wrong, I&#x2019;m old hat. I was hoping to enter the University as an instructor.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;An instructor?&#x201D; The Keeper blinked in astonishment and the smirk slipping from his face. He stared at Lan Jue in amazement. &#x201C;You want to be a teacher? Did I hear that right? You aren&#x2019;t going there to corrupt the youth of our nation, are you?&#x201D;</p><p>Lan Jue forced a wry smile. &#x201C;Keeper, is that honestly what you think of my character?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Oh not at all,&#x201D; The Keeper replied, &#x201C;It&#x2019;s just that not long ago I saw something about a man stealing another man&#x2019;s wife. Terrible business.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Eh&#x2026;&#x201D; Lan Jue&#x2019;s face grew rigid. He&#x2019;d certainly blocked Skyfire&#x2019;s Satellite Network at the time. Had the Keeper been there?</p><p>&#x201C;I&#x2019;ve some connections,&#x201D; The Keeper continued nonchalantly. &#x201C;Getting you a job as an instructor wouldn&#x2019;t be a problem. It&#x2019;s just an old man like me who&#x2019;s spent his life enlightening the inquisitive, I hope the teacher I recommend doesn&#x2019;t end up being a poor influence.&#x201D;</p><p>Lan Jue once more smirked towards the old man. &#x201C;In fact I&#x2019;m really not a good teacher. I&#x2019;m actually going there to act as a bodyguard, so some official post with no real responsibility would be best.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Then what were you looking for,&#x201D; the Keeper asked.</p><p>Lan Jue, in response, leaned close to whisper in to the old man&#x2019;s ear.</p><p>When Lan Jue had finished speaking, it was as though the Keeper&#x2019;s craggy face had deepened. &#x201C;You&apos;re serious?&#x201D;</p><p>Lan Jue rejoined with serious countenance. &#x201C;It&#x2019;s an area I&#x2019;m skilled in, and I can promise you I wont be a bad influence or shoddy instructor. Students who learned these skills certainly wouldn&#x2019;t be at a disadvantage.&#x201D;</p><p>The Keeper gave him a strange look. &#x201C;Interesting,&#x201D; he muttered. &#x201C;Very interesting. Very well, then you go ahead and give it a shot. But be assured, if you hurt my relationship with the university, I won&#x2019;t forgive you.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Be at ease. I know the implications.&#x201D; Lan Jue dare not offend the man before him. He&#x2019;d heard stories about the old man from the Wine Master. He had apparently perfected science to the point of a Discipline, becoming an Adept of science. Rarely did he deign to act, but when he did it was world-shaking. A mad scientist capable of firing positron explosions from his hands while suspended in mid-air, probably not the best idea to make him mad. The Wine Master had once told Lan Jue that Skyfire Avenue had only known two synthetic Tenth-Level Adepts. The Keeper was one of them. He was also considered Skyfire Avenue&#x2019;s ultimate weapon. His power was considered synthetic because it was not derived from genetic Talent, but from intense learning and cultivation. His natural Talent didn&#x2019;t exceed Sixth-Level.</p><p>The second Tenth-Level was naturally the Clairvoyant. On the surface the two looked incapable of holding their own in a fight. Only the inner council members knew the truth; they weren&#x2019;t bad at fighting, just bad at skirmishes. When they fought they couldn&#x2019;t help but rip the heavens and drown the earth&#x2026;</p><p>&#x201C;Remember young man, when the time comes to show your powers don&#x2019;t hold back. Sometimes, the best way to avoid trouble is letting people know exactly what you&#x2019;re capable of.&#x201D;</p><p></p><p style="text-align: center">&#x3B6;</p><p></p><p>Three days later, a letter of appointment from the National Eastern University arrived at Zeus&#x2019; Jewelry Shop.</p><p>&#x201C;Boss, you&#x2019;re really going to be a teacher?&#x201D; Ke&#x2019;er&#x2019;s bright eyes watched Lan Jue closely.</p><p>Lan Jue nodded his head half-heartedly. &#x201C;Uh-huh.&#x201D;</p><p>Ke&#x2019;er sighed wistfully. &#x201C;Then you&#x2019;ll definitely be the most <em>handsome</em> teacher there! It&#x2019;s just&#x2026; why?&#x201D;</p><p>Lan Jue smirked. &#x201C;I&#x2019;ve got nothing to do in my spare time.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Blach!&#x201D; Ke&#x2019;er seemed to be choking on her own saliva. &#x201C;I&#x2019;ll send you, okay! Oh and by the way, the gourmet wanted me to remind you that the Bluefin Tuna will be ready to eat in two days.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Mmhm,&#x201D; Lan Jue said, his eyes lighting up. It was certainly good news. &#x201C;I&#x2019;m going in to the back to rest for a while. I have to prepare to report for duty.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Do you need me to start packing some things?&#x201D; Xiuxiu&#x2019;s gentle voice inquired.</p><p>Lan Jue shook his head.</p><p>Returning to his room, Lan Jue extricated his interstellar communicator and input a number.</p><p>After a moment, a pleasant voice rang through the speaker. &#x201C;What are you doing?&#x201D;</p><p>Softly, Lan Jue answered. &#x201C;At your request, I will be reporting to your school this afternoon. Do you need protection?&#x201D;</p><p>The fair-sounding voice on the other end fell silent for a moment. &#x201C;Keep in touch. This afternoon I&#x2019;ll take you around the campus. After you&#x2019;re more familiar with the place we&#x2019;ll talk more.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Fine,&#x201D; Lan Jue torpidly responded.</p><p>&#x201C;Oh right, and what&#x2019;s your name?&#x201D; Zhou Qianlin asked.</p><p>Lan Jue truly didn&#x2019;t understand why it was so easy to upset this girl. &#x201C;Didn&#x2019;t I tell you, that day?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Did you? I forgot. I tend not to bother with unimportant things or people.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;My name&#x2019;s Lan Jue,&#x201D; he growled through the receiver.</p><p>Zhou Qianlin continued. &#x201C;I was thinking, it would be better if we pretended we didn&#x2019;t know each other in public. You can protect me from behind the scenes. How you do that is up to you, it shouldn&#x2019;t be my job to tell you how.&#x201D;</p><p>Lan Jue was confounded. &#x201C;Why? What&#x2019;s with the sudden change of heart?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Because,&#x201D; she said, &#x201C;If my classmates discovered I knew you, they&#x2019;d be bound to question my taste.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;&#x2026;&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;By the way, I wanted to ask you a legal question,&#x201D; Zhou Qianlin said. &#x201C;You don&#x2019;t get capital punishment for annoying someone to death, right?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Zhou Qianlin, do you happen to know what I&#x2019;ll be teaching at your university,&#x201D; Lan Jue said, the indignation eating away at him suddenly dissolving and replaced with a sly grin. <em>Annoy me to death? Sh*t, you haven&#x2019;t even seen what I can do.</em></p><p></p><hr><p></p>
