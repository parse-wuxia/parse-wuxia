<p></p><p style="text-align: center"><b>Chapter 587: Retreat</b></p><p></p><p><span style="">Neither Captus nor Occisus could harm the Violet Princess. She was on a whole other realm of dominance. If there were many like her in her species, then when the battle came&#x2026;</span></p><p><span style="">Lan Jue thought back to the Clairvoyant and his earliest predictions. If this is what he saw in those visions, he could understand why the situation was so dire.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Did you record the fight?&#x201D; He asked Mika.</span></p><p><span style="">She nodded. &#x201C;Everything after we arrived.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Su Xiaosu interjected, standing nearby. &#x201C;I have the first part on my communicator.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Lan Jue&#x2019;s voice was low. &#x201C;Clean it up and send a copy to Majesty. Tell them to relay it to the Avenue immediately, highest priority.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Could she just be a powerful Paragon, not an alien?&#x201D; The Driver said, hesitant to jump to conclusions.</span></p><p><span style="">Lan Jue&#x2019;s lips turned in a bitter smirk. &#x201C;I hoped so. But her aura, the savagery, her fighting style, the fact she </span><i><span style="">ate</span></i><span style=""> the Barber&#x2026; it all confirms my suspicions. We fought the aliens on Tempest. We know they can get into the Starfields. If&#x2026;&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">He trailed off when something outside caught his eye. His pupils contracted. &#x201C;What is that?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The others had been keenly watching when they saw his expression change. They followed his shocked gaze out the bridge window. Instantly their faces matched Lan Jue&#x2019;s, filled with shock and disbelief.</span></p><p><span style="">Zeus-1 had shed Moonfiend&#x2019;s atmosphere, and the vista of outer space was revealed from the airship&#x2019;s windows. What they saw was the encroaching asteroid hail. Three swirling cyclones of violet energy had appeared among the crashing stones.</span></p><p><span style="">They were ten thousand kilometers across at least. From the vantage of their tiny airship, it was a truly spectacular scene. Light stopped at they neared the borders of the vortexes, photons ripped apart. It was apocalyptic.</span></p><p><span style="">The Accountant&#x2019;s voice crackled through the bridge&#x2019;s speakers. &#x201C;Zeus-1, Zeus-1! This is Majesty. Powerful, unknown energy fluctuations have appeared. Requesting permission to retreat!&#x201D; His voice was beginning to sound desperate.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Granted,&#x201D; Lan Jue affirmed. &#x201C;Majesty and everyone else. Get out as fast as you can, make your way to Skyfire.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Acknowledged. Jewelry Master, are you coming?&#x201D; The Accountant sounded much relieved by the order to withdraw.</span></p><p><span style="">Lan Jue hesitated for a moment. &#x201C;Yes, we&#x2019;re all pulling out.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I anticipated your order and took the liberty of having the Coffee Master and Bartender take their ships back first. They move slower,&#x201D; the Accountant confessed.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;No time for that,&#x201D; Lan Jue replied. &#x201C;Everyone needs to get out, immediately.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Aye aye!&#x201D; The Accountant felt a weight lift from his chest, appearing to have avoided Lan Jue&#x2019;s wrath. Majesty briefly shed its cloak and twinkled against the dark backdrop of space. The battleship then reengaged its invisibility and headed toward Zeus-1. Mika turned their ship around to prepare for their exit.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I&#x2019;m getting in the ejection capsule. Mika, shoot me out,&#x201D; Lan Jue ordered.</span></p><p><span style="">Her head snapped around to look at him. &#x201C;Boss, you &#x2013;&#x201C;</span></p><p><span style="">He narrowed his eyes, catching the words in her throat. He didn&#x2019;t speak, he didn&#x2019;t need to. But Mika resolutely shook her head. &#x201C;No. No!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Zeus-1 picked up speed.</span></p><p><span style="">Lan Jue&#x2019;s voice was hard with anger. &#x201C;So you&#x2019;re going to force me to disgrace myself? My mother&#x2019;s down there. You fall back, and I&#x2019;ll go down to help. After a little while come back to pick us up.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I&#x2019;m going too,&#x201D; the Pharmacist announced.</span></p><p><span style="">Lan Jue shook his head. &#x201C;You have Jun&#x2019;er to look after, we can&#x2019;t risk you. Gourmet, everyone, I&#x2019;m ordering you to retreat. No one will follow me. You&#x2019;re all necessary for the war against these aliens. If you believe the Clairvoyant&#x2019;s predictions, then no harm should come to me. I&#x2019;ll just be there to support the Photographer as much as I can. Someone needs to be there to record what happens. I&#x2019;ll make sure to send all the data and keep updates. I&#x2019;m the only one who can do this. Now don&#x2019;t worry, my mother&#x2019;s strong. Even if she can&#x2019;t defeat the princess, escaping shouldn&#x2019;t be too difficult. When we&#x2019;re out of danger, we&#x2019;ll get in contact.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Lan Jue was calm. He was addressing the leadership of Star Division.</span></p><p><span style="">The Pharmacist opened her mouth to protest, but the Gourmet put a hand on her shoulder. &#x201C;Commander&#x2019;s orders!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Lan Jue was a God-ranked mecha pilot, and third strongest in their group. With Zeus&#x2019; help he could survive longer out in pace than the Gourmet could. It was clearly the right choice.</span></p><p><span style="">Lan Jue looked at the Gourmet with a grateful eye. He turned and made his way to the ejection pod.</span></p><p><span style="">Suddenly, a soft voice caught his ear. &#x201C;Don&#x2019;t go. Don&#x2019;t waste your effort, good child.&#x201D; There was a flicker of pink, and the Photographer appeared on the ship&#x2019;s deck. Her face was pale and she stumbled, nearly falling but for the support of the Pharmacist beside her.</span></p><p><span style="">Everyone was relieved to see her, Lan Jue particularly. He rushed to her side.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ma, are you alright?&#x201D; He asked with deep concern.</span></p><p><span style="">She smirked at him. &#x201C;I won&#x2019;t die. Let&#x2019;s get out of here. In all my life I&#x2019;ve never seen interspatial fluctuations as strong as these &#x2013; not normal cosmic turbulence. We need to get clear as quick as possible.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Mika didn&#x2019;t need to wait for instructions. When the Photographer appeared she was overjoyed, and wasted no time in pulling Zeus-1 into an escape trajectory.</span></p><p><span style="">Lan Jue returned to the main control console. &#x201C;Majesty, this is Zeus-1. Release all your probes and get as much data from the surroundings as you can.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Aye aye, Majesty acknowledges!&#x201D; Came the Accountant&#x2019;s reply.</span></p><p><span style="">Both ships made their final preparations then beat an escape as fast as their engines could muster. In no time they were tearing through space at the speed of light.</span></p><p><span style="">Probes silently spun in orbit around Moonfiend. Linking eyes watched the surrounding chaos and sent the images back to the Division armada.</span></p><p></p><p style="text-align: center">&#x3B6;</p><p></p><p><span style="">On the surface of Moonfiend.</span></p><p><span style="">A violet shadow was frozen solid. A series of clicks issued from it over and over until suddenly, a burst of violet light erupted from it. The shadow was shattered, revealing none other than the Violet Princess.</span></p><p><span style="">There was confusion in her eyes. However, the pursed lips and irritated expression spoke to her displeasure. In another circumstance she looked like she might be a beautiful woman irritated with her boyfriend. It was an insidious mask, hiding the terror beneath.</span></p><p><span style="">The swirling whirlpools of energy around the planet continued to expand until the asteroid belt threatening Moonfiend was swallowed up and vanished.</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p>
