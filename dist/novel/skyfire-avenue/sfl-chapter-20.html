<p></p><p style="text-align: center"><strong>Chapter 20: You Owe Me</strong></p><p></p><p>&#x201C;Where are we.&#x201D; Zhou Qianlin was first to break the awkward stillness in the room.</p><p>&#x201C;My home,&#x201D; Lan Jue responded.</p><p>The corner of Zhou Qianlin&#x2019;s mouth twitched. She&#x2019;d been brought up from a very young age to be cultured and refined, but facing the guy in front of her, more than once she fought the impulse to curse him out.</p><p>Lan Jue started, aware of the mistake. &#x201C;Oh. This is Skyfire Avenue.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Skyfire Avenue?&#x201D; Zhou Qianlin certainly knew of Skyfire Avenue, in fact everyone in the Eastern Alliance knew of it.</p><p>It was a unique place, a sanctuary for nobility. It was independent from the outside world, the one area where machinery wasn&#x2019;t permitted. An exotic oasis.</p><p>Even after many years, in the face of many former Eastern Alliance dynasties, none were able to altar the avenue&#x2019;s rules.</p><p>&#x201C;Take me home,&#x201D; Zhou Qianlin said softly.</p><p>&#x201C;Yeah.&#x201D;</p><p>The sky was dark, night had arrived earlier than usual. The two walked along Skyfire Avenue side by side, but with a foot of space between them.</p><p>&#x201C;What do you plan to do?&#x201D; As they reached the end of the two-thousand forty-eight meter Avenue, he couldn&#x2019;t help but ask.</p><p>Of course he knew that after what had happened today, how could she face the stress and troubles.</p><p>Had she been Hera, of course there wouldn&#x2019;t have been any problem. He&#x2019;d have had a good reason for his actions. But she wasn&#x2019;t. So the mistake was his, and a very grave mistake it was.</p><p>Zhou Qianlin stopped, turning towards him with a grim look. &#x201C;It isn&#x2019;t your concern.&#x201D;</p><p>Lan Jue shrugged his shoulders. &#x201C;Now&#x2019;s not the time to pout.&#x201D;</p><p>Zhou Qianlin glared at him. &#x201C;Oh, can you turn back time then?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Ugh&#x2026; you don&#x2019;t need to worry about that.&#x201D; Lan Jue didn&#x2019;t possess that power. In fact, it was exceptionally rare to find someone with that Discipline. At best they were able to roll back time only a very little while, and even then only in a very small location.</p><p>Still less, some things simply can&#x2019;t be undone&#x2026;</p><p>Zhou Qianlin&#x2019;s eyes grew cold. &#x201C;I&#x2019;ll handle it, it isn&#x2019;t your concern.&#x201D; She began to hurriedly walk away.</p><p>&#x201C;I&#x2019;ll send you back.&#x201D; Lan Jue moved to catch up. Before them, they&#x2019;d reached the end of Skyfire Avenue&#x2019;s scope.</p><p>Zhou Qianlin turned her heard to look at him. &#x201C;Do you want to be a public enemy of the Eastern Alliance?&#x201D;</p><p>Lan Jue stopped in his tracks. That&#x2019;s right! All of Skyfire City could be in turmoil because of her kidnapping.</p><p>&#x201C;I&#x2019;m not that fragile. I can handle myself. Go back,&#x201D; Zhou Qianlin said.</p><p>He stared at her dumbly. From the obstinance in her eyes, Lan Jue could see the Hera he knew, the Hera who was gentle as water and a moment later throwing a fit. It was something he also dreaded.</p><p>&#x201C;This is my interstellar communication number.&#x201D; He produced a slip of paper and pressed it in to her hand. &#x201C;If you need anything, let me know.&#x201D;</p><p>The ambiguity of his statement caused Zhou Qianlin&#x2019;s pretty face to redden. Lan Jue immediately recognized his error, but she didn&#x2019;t wait for him to explain, instead turning and walking away.</p><p>&#x201C;Your wedding dress is still at my place,&#x201D; he called after her.</p><p>&#x201C;I don&#x2019;t want it. You&#x2019;ve polluted it.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Well, when are you going to give me back that dress,&#x201D; he asked.</p><p>Zhou Qianlin stopped, spinning to fix him with a burning glare. &#x201C;I&#x2019;m NOT!&#x201D; She turned away again.</p><p>The corners of Lan Jue&#x2019;s mouth twitched.<em> This girl&#x2019;s temper is worse than her older sisters, and cold as ice. Damnit! What did have I done?</em></p><p>Zhou Qianlin&#x2019;s voice wafted from the distance. &#x201C;You owe me, and you better pay me back! When I know what I want from you, you&#x2019;ll hear from me.&#x201D;</p><p>As her words dissipated in to silence, so too did she disappear into the dark.</p><p>He stood in silence for a long while afterward, staring in to the darkness where she left, stunned.</p><p>Gradually his face grew hard, and a pale light flickered in his eyes. A thick anger rose within him, from his very bones.</p><p>Zeus, enraged!</p><p>That woman.. Pearl!</p><p><em>If not for her information, I never would have arranged such an ordeal. Worse, it brought trouble upon a loyal brother. That precious block of technetium, and this is what I get in return?</em></p><p>&#x201C;You don&#x2019;t look like you&#x2019;re in the best mood,&#x201D; a deep voice uttered not far behind him.</p><p>Lan Jue turned to see the Wine Master at his back, clad in an impeccable and crisp business suit. Lan Jue walked towards him. &#x201C;New suit?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Mm.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Nice fabric.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;One hundred sixty thread count.&#x201D;</p><p>Lan Jue stared at the Wine Master. &#x201C;I won&#x2019;t bring any trouble to Skyfire Avenue. If something happens, I&#x2019;ll assume all the responsibility.&#x201D;</p><p>The Wine Master spoke after a moment. &#x201C;Have a drink?&#x201D;</p><p>Lan Jue&#x2019;s eyes brightened. &#x201C;What are we drinking?&#x201D;</p><p>The Wine Master considered. &#x201C;Your situation&#x2026; red wine isn&#x2019;t appropriate. Whiskey, I think.&#x201D;</p><p>The edges of Lan Jue&#x2019;s mouth curled. &#x201C;We nobles are certainly capable of self-control.&#x201D;</p><p>The Wine Master&#x2019;s lips revealed the ghost of a smile. &#x201C;You had quite the murderous look in your eye a moment ago. It looked like you wanted to something a noble shouldn&#x2019;t do.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Compared with drinking, it isn&#x2019;t urgent,&#x201D; Lan Jue replied quietly. &#x201C;A true noble must be responsible. At the same time, they have a responsibility to help those in need, bear their responsibilities. This benefits society, so how is it something an aristocrat shouldn&#x2019;t do? If someone had taken your 1990 Romanee-Conti, would you be laughing?&#x201D;</p><p>The Wine Master&#x2019;s face stiffened, obviously recalling that unpleasant day.</p><p>Lan Jue grinned. &#x201C;Whiskey then. Talisker, 1985 single malt, what do you think?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Henceforth you are persona non grata in the Gothic Winery. You&#x2019;ll not see me again.&#x201D; The Wine Master turned and began to walk off.</p><p>Smiling, Lan Jue hurried to catch up. &#x201C;Take it easy, I&#x2019;ll pay.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;No!&#x201D; he replied indignantly.</p><p>Lan Jue sighed. &#x201C;I really am not in the best mood. If you want to hear my story I can tell you.&#x201D;</p><p>The Wine Master glanced at him. &#x201C;I don&#x2019;t have 1985. I have a bottle of Talisker 18-year, though. You want it or not?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Off we go!&#x201D; Lan Jue said categorically.</p><p>The Wine Master grinned. &#x201C;Aristocrats have such high moral integrity.&#x201D;</p><p>Lan Jue shot him a puzzles glance. &#x201C;I do! I&#x2019;m not going just for a drink. The Iberian ham from before has already been cut, if someone doesn&#x2019;t eat it it&#x2019;ll go bad. Whiskey goes well with ham. Yeah, the Gourmet&#x2019;s method of heating it up really was something. In fact let&#x2019;s call him, his meal preparation is deserving of your praise.&#x201D;</p><p>The Wine Master sucked in a breath. &#x201C;You are no noble, you&#x2019;re a damn bandit!&#x201D;</p><p></p><hr><p></p>
