<p></p><p style="text-align: center"><strong>Chapter 368: Why Didn&#x2019;t You Tell Me?</strong></p><p></p><p>Indeed, just as Lilou Bize-Leroy said, he could feel the arrow strengthening him from within. The image of the Arrow of Compassion hung behind his eyelids, as though a mere thought would bring it back in to being.</p><p>Aubert de Villaine slowly made his way to Bize&#x2019;s side. &#x201C;Bize,&#x201D; he began, &#x201C;I&#x2026;&#x201D;</p><p>She cut him off with a sideways glance. &#x201C;Remember what you said! Slave, those were the words &#x2013; starting right now!&#x201D;</p><p>Aubert was perhaps happier than any person who&#x2019;d ever been coerced in to slavery before. After centuries, she had forgiven him &#x2013; after a fashion. It meant they would finally be together again.</p><p>&#x201C;I swear to you I will not repeat my past mistakes. No matter what &#x2013; you could curse me, beat me, it doesn&#x2019;t matter &#x2013; I&#x2019;ll be half a step from your side until the end. I&#x2019;ll use the remainder of my days paying you back for the wrong I committed. Wherever you go, I&#x2019;ll be there. Whatever you need me to do, will be done.&#x201D;</p><p>Lan Jue barely contained the wince he felt. He was all over her like white on rice.</p><p>It was, however, what Bize wanted to hear. Her features softened almost immediately. &#x201C;You all may go. Come by once a year perhaps, we&#x2019;ll share the vintage we create. You can help bring us a few comforts that are difficult to get out here.&#x201D;</p><p>Aubert&#x2019;s brows shot up, then, as a thought came to him. He looked toward the Wine Master. &#x201C;Actually, I was hoping I might beg a favor.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Of course,&#x201D; he replied.</p><p>After a moment of consideration, Aubert continued. &#x201C;My&#x2026; plans get me in bed with some powerful people in the Western Alliance. With things as they are now, I have no interest in continuing that course of action. I suspect that with your power, together with Bize and my own, we could move Beaune to another location. Just somewhere else here on the planet. If you were to open a dimensional pocket for it, no one would come to trouble us.&#x201D;</p><p>There was a note of misgiving in the elderly vintner&#x2019;s voice. It was the Wine Master&#x2019;s time to mull things over, but after a second he replied. &#x201C;If I may, predecessor, this cooperation you had with the West&#x2026;&#x201D;</p><p>Aubert shook his head. &#x201C;I may have decided to change plans, but that doesn&#x2019;t mean I&#x2019;m going to sell out my former business partners. Find out for yourselves if you must, but you won&#x2019;t hear it from me. You&#x2019;re also under no obligation to help us move, we can manage otherwise I&#x2019;m sure.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Not a problem,&#x201D; the Wine Master said hurriedly. &#x201C;I&#x2019;d be happy to lend my assistance. It looks as though my friend needs some more time to meditate regardless. Perhaps we could ask you for your hospitality for a few days.&#x201D;</p><p>The two old wine maker&#x2019;s nodded their wrinkled heads.</p><p>Three Paragons working in concert were capable of miraculous things. Beaune was no small town, but between the three of them, moving it would not be an issue.</p><p>The Wine Master turned his attention to Lan Jue. &#x201C;Jewelry Master,&#x201D; he began. &#x201C;Will you making preparations to stay, or will you be returning to the other teachers?&#x201D;</p><p>He didn&#x2019;t need to think very long for an answer. &#x201C;I&#x2019;ll be heading out, there are some other matters I need to take care of. Once they&#x2019;re settled I&#x2019;ll leave directly for the North. There&#x2019;s still the tournament to prepare for.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Alright, then safe travels to you. The Pauper and I will return to Skyfire Avenue once business it concluded here. Keep safe,&#x201D; the Wine Master urged.</p><p>Lan Jue nodded. He turned, then, to the two gods of wine. &#x201C;Congratulations on finding each other again. I have to be going.&#x201D;</p><p>Bize gave him a black look. &#x201C;Lan Jue, Jewelry Master&#x2026; whatever you name is, puppet, I don&#x2019;t care. Qianlin is my prot&#xE9;g&#xE9;, and if you upset her I&#x2019;ll chop your legs off. Understand?&#x201D;</p><p>He could only grin awkwardly. &#x201C;Not to worry. I&#x2019;m off!&#x201D;</p><p>Aubert reached out with a hand, and the mirror-flat bottom of the lake overhead split down the center. The beautiful sky of the Barrows was revealed. Lan Jue thanked them with a bow, then changed himself in to lightning and darted away.</p><p>The lake closed behind him. Once things were back to normal, Bize brought her eyes over to Aubert. The old man had a smile plastered on his craggy face. &#x201C;Are you hungry, darling? I can make you some food.&#x201D;</p><p>The Wine Master was the very picture of poise, but even he couldn&#x2019;t suppress a chuckle at the cute old pair. In the end, it all worked out well &#x2013; better, for in fact two of the great gods of wine still lived! He was terribly excited to stay here for a few days. Then there was this storage room Gates mentioned, with wines from over three hundred years ago&#x2026;</p><p></p><p style="text-align: center">&#x3B6;</p><p></p><p>Water exploded outward from the lake like a fountain, as Lan Jue blasted through the last few feet of water. In a flash, he was on the banks. His features were strange, struggling with a host of conflicting emotions. Microscopic bolts of lightning crackled behind his eyes. <em>Silkworm Dharma&#x2026; Mystic Raiment&#x2026; Qianlin, you-</em></p><p>He pulled free a set of clothes he&#x2019;d borrowed to give to Qianlin. He then shut his eyes. There was a flash of light, and the young woman appeared to separate from Lan Jue and appear at his side. She quickly scrambled to pluck up the clothes and put them on.</p><p>&#x201C;Alright,&#x201D; she said, her voice thin and timid.</p><p>Lan Jue opened his eyes to find Zhou Qianlin staring right back. For a long time they just looked at one another.</p><p>He didn&#x2019;t even know how to begin, or how to face her. She&#x2019;d given up a lot for him.</p><p>&#x201C;Why didn&#x2019;t you tell me?&#x201D; He asked.</p><p>&#x201C;What would that have achieved,&#x201D; she said, as though she&#x2019;d expected the question. &#x201C;To earn some sympathy? Like it or not, I used my power. It&#x2019;s done, so what&#x2019;s the point in discussing it. I wasn&#x2019;t even using it, really, and at my speed I&#x2019;ll be back to ninth level in no time. I&#x2019;m at no disadvantage, since Bize ensured that our powers are joined. With you here now, I can use a more offensive Discipline if needed. That&#x2019;s a net gain in the end.&#x201D;</p><p>Her words were soft, but the longer she went on the harder Lan Jue had to hold back. Seeing her like this - with her twinkling impish eyes and half-smile &#x2013; he couldn&#x2019;t stop himself, and grabbed her up in a hug. She found herself pressed tightly against his warm chest.</p><p>Zhou Qianlin didn&#x2019;t know how to react. One second she was on the defensive, and the next she was caught in a bone-popping hug. A small turned the corners of her lips, while her head rested comfortably on his shoulder. Her fingers laced together behind his back.</p><p>&#x201C;It was quite a scene. I wouldn&#x2019;t have thought Granny Bize would have spilled the beans, but here we are &#x2013; I&#x2019;m embarrassed. Should I go speak to her?&#x201D; Qianlin asked.</p><p>Lan Jue shook his head. &#x201C;There will be other opportunities to meet with her. Qianlin&#x2026; thank you, for everything you&#x2019;ve done for me. Thank you for saving my life.&#x201D;</p><p>Qianlin&#x2019;s body stiffened as she pushed him away. &#x201C;This is why I didn&#x2019;t tell you &#x2013; because I don&#x2019;t want your thanks. My sister would have done the same thing. I&#x2019;m just here to help, and I know that the only woman in your heart is my sister. That&#x2019;s proven by the fact that you&#x2019;re still single, even despite being surrounded by beautiful girls. It hurts sometimes, but it also makes me happy for my sister. At the very least, she picked a good guy. If she were still alive, you two would be very happy.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;If you are really grateful for the help I&#x2019;ve given, then I beg you <em>not</em> to say you like me as some sort of payback. If we do get together someday, I want it because we grew to that point naturally. I don&#x2019;t want it to be because you feel like you owe me something. Love shouldn&#x2019;t be built on compensation. Alright?&#x201D;</p><p>As Qianlin lectured him, her features were calm and even. She stared at him with an earnest look. It was a look that silenced Lan Jue. There was a lot he&#x2019;d wanted to say, but under her stare he simply pursed his lips and nodded.</p><p>&#x201C;Alright, I promise.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;This was a very unexpected thing,&#x201D; Qianlin said. She drew closer to him again, smiling sweetly. &#x201C;Who could have predicted this would have happened? Poor Granny Bize, harboring a three hundred year old heartache. Well, where to next? I don&#x2019;t know if the tourist party has gone yet or not.&#x201D;</p><p>Lan Jue shrugged. &#x201C;Whether they have or not, we can&#x2019;t go back. We&#x2019;ve got somewhere else to visit &#x2013; to save someone.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Save someone?&#x201D; Zhou Qianlin gave him a strange look. Quickly, though, her face returned to normal. &#x201C;It isn&#x2019;t another girl, is it?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Ehm&#x2026; yeah. Yeah it is,&#x201D; he replied.</p><p>&#x201C;I figured. This guy&#x2026;&#x201D; Qianlin said with a frown.</p><p>Lan Jue almost sputtered, trying to get his response out as quick as possible. &#x201C;That&#x2019;s why I&#x2019;m bringing you! Under your supervision, I&#x2019;ll toe the line, right? If I mess up you can beat me up. What do you think?&#x201D;</p><p>She snorted a laugh at his expense. &#x201C;Fine, just remember you said it. I won&#x2019;t go easy.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Alright. Just don&#x2019;t hit so hard you hurt yourself,&#x201D; Lan Jue said with faux concern. &#x201C;And proper ladies don&#x2019;t curse.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;<em>You&#x2019;re a proper lady!&#x201D; </em>Qianlin pouted.</p><p>&#x201C;Off we go!&#x201D; Lan Jue grabbed her hand without warning, and the two of them were off like a streak.</p><p>As they tore through the sky, Lan Jue ruminated on the new information he&#x2019;d received. The first thing he noted, was his growing affection for Zhou Qianlin. More importantly, though, that wall between them felt as though it was much thinner.</p><p>Maybe all they needed was time. Lately, there was evidence enough for Lan Jue to take heart.</p><p>It didn&#x2019;t take them long to find a public use air terminal. Lan Jue was worried he&#x2019;d run in to Richard, but he was nowhere to be seen. Apparently the Pauper&#x2019;s methods had been effective. A peak-level Adept&#x2019;s threats were not to be taken lightly. It appeared as though Richard&#x2019;s own ninth-ranked Adept protector had convinced the young politician&#x2019;s son to leave. Hence their lack of trouble.</p><p>But before they boarded the ship for the next long leg of their journey, Lan Jue decided to take Zhou Qianlin out for a nice meal. Things had been strange and emotional, so some good food would be appreciated.</p><p>It was a wonderful dining experience, even considering the fare was entirely vegetarian. Still, a shadow of anxiety still lurked in the recesses of Lan Jue&#x2019;s heart. Where they were going next, would be a lot more dangerous than Beaune.</p><p></p><hr><p></p>
