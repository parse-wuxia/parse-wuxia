<p></p><p style="text-align: center"><strong>Chapter 64: Hera?</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>&#xA0;</strong></p><p>&#x201C;Let&#x2019;s go!&#x201D; Zhou Qianlin had become a natural sitting on the back seat of the bicycle. Lan Jue pushed the bike forward off the tip of his toes.</p><p>Lan Jue was garbed in simple attire; blue jeans, white leisure shoes and a white shirt. Simple and stylish.</p><p>Sitting behind him, Zhou Qianlin asked, &#x201C;How long have you been waiting?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Only a little bit,&#x201D; he replied.</p><p>&#x201C;When&#x2019;s your second class?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Actually there won&#x2019;t be a second class for a little while,&#x201D; Lan Jue said. &#x201C;I was actually just going to tell you, I&#x2019;m afraid I&#x2019;m going to have to play hookie for a little while.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Huh?&#x201D; Zhou Qianlin shot a confused gaze at his back.</p><p>He continued. &#x201C;There&#x2019;s a matter I have to deal with. I was just at the teaching affairs office asking for leave.&#x201D;</p><p>For a moment she was speechless, but eventually found her voice. &#x201C;You have one class, then ask for leave? Aren&#x2019;t you afraid the school will dismiss you?&#x201D;</p><p>Lan Jue smiled bitterly at the road before him. &#x201C;They wouldn&#x2019;t go so far as to dismiss me. But the Dean Wu&#x2019;s face certainly wasn&#x2019;t pretty.&#x201D;</p><p>Zhou Qianlin chuckled. &#x201C;Director Wu&#x2019;s face is usually like that. But if you&#x2019;re just going to leave like that what about your bodyguard responsibilities?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;This is also something I wanted to ask you about. What do you think? This is a very important matter, something I have to handle in person. I have to head out to another planet so it&#x2019;ll be a while.&#x201D;</p><p>A tremor of anxiety thrilled through Zhou Qianlin&#x2019;s eyes. &#x201C;How long?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;If there aren&#x2019;t any troubles, about a month,&#x201D; he said.</p><p>Zhou Qianlin fell silent.</p><p>Lan Jue didn&#x2019;t speak either, and the atmosphere became somber.</p><p>&#x201C;I&#x2019;m sorry! I really am a person of my word, but I really do have something that I must deal with. We&#x2019;ll just add the time to my service. However long I&#x2019;m gone, we&#x2019;ll add that much time. And I&#x2019;ll find someone else to look after you during this time. You definitely wont be in any danger.&#x201D;</p><p>Zhou Qianlin shook her head. &#x201C;I don&#x2019;t need anyone else to look after me. We&#x2019;ll just postpone the time.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Hey, since when did you become so pliable?&#x201D; Lan Jue was quite surprised at the change.</p><p>She huffed at him. &#x201C;I&#x2019;m not in the mood to haggle with you. But I need your guarantee, whatever you&#x2019;re doing can&#x2019;t interfere with your teaching qualifications. Otherwise doing your job is going to become much harder.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Not a problem,&#x201D; he said without hesitation.</p><p>With the atmosphere once more light-hearted they continued, but a touch of anxiety still lingered in Zhou Qianlin&#x2019;s beautiful jade-green eyes. On the occasions her eyes landed upon Lan Jue, their depths grew even more complicated.</p><p>It didn&#x2019;t matter how strong Lan Jue&#x2019;s genetic talent was, he couldn&#x2019;t see the changes in those beautiful eyes.</p><p>The trip to Skyfire Avenue from the school wasn&#x2019;t a short one. The sky had already grown dark by the time they arrived.</p><p>Lan Jue dismounted the bike just outside of the Avenue. Even though the bike was man-powered, it was stilled considered machinery and thus was banned from use in Skyfire Avenue. But it could be pushed in, since it was - after all - an antique.</p><p>As a councilman, he also had the authority to bring &#x2018;normal&#x2019; people in without incident.</p><p>Passing along the brick-lined, elegant simplicity of the Avenue caused Zhou Qianlin to swing her eyes every which way in curiosity.</p><p>&#x201C;They&#x2019;re beautiful.&#x201D; She couldn&#x2019;t help the tones of amazement in her voice.</p><p>Lan Jue&#x2019;s face betrayed a small smile. &#x201C;The pride of Skyfire Avenue.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;It&#x2019;s deserved. What are we eating tonight?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;First we&#x2019;ve got to change clothes,&#x201D; Lan Jue said.</p><p>She stopped in her tracks and turned to face him, wide-eyed. &#x201C;You really prepared clothes for me?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;That&#x2019;s how reliable I am!&#x201D;</p><p>Zhou Qianlin snorted a sarcastic laugh. &#x201C;You&#x2019;re such a sweetheart.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;If you&#x2019;d give me back those clothes I lent you that night, it&#x2019;d be even better,&#x201D; Lan Jue probed.</p><p>Zhou Qianlin raised her pretty brows. &#x201C;Those are my sisters, not yours! Can you wear them? If you can fit then I&#x2019;ll give it back.&#x201D;</p><p>Lan Jue&#x2019;s mouth curled in to a frown. &#x201C;Forget I said anything&#x2026;&#x201D;</p><p>The whole of Skyfire Avenue stretched two thousand and eighty meters. It wasn&#x2019;t long before the sapphire door of Zeus&#x2019; Jewelry Shop appeared before them.</p><p>&#x201C;Compared to the other places, your shop is hideous.&#x201D; Zhou Qianlin sneered at the door.</p><p>&#x201C;Just missing a little of that rustic charm,&#x201D; he said helplessly.</p><p><em>Ding ding ding!</em> The bells above the door heralded their entrance.</p><p>&#x201C;Hello and welco-&#x201D; came Ke&#x2019;er&#x2019;s fair voice in greeting, though the final word caught in her throat as her eyes fell upon them. They grew large in disbelief.</p><p>&#x201C;What is it, Ke&#x2019;er?&#x201D; Xiuxiu stopped tidying to look up at the sound of Ke&#x2019;er&#x2019;s strange voice. In an instant she, too, was as stupefied as her co-worker. For a moment her pretty face looked like she had a stroke. She looked almost frightened.</p><p>&#x201C;H-hera?&#x201D; Ke&#x2019;er and Xiuxiu called out, almost on top of one another. Their disbelief was so strong that they feared even speaking her name might make her disappear.</p><p>Lan Jue and Zhou Qianlin stood shoulder to shoulder. His voice raised slightly as he spoke. &#x201C;Finally it isn&#x2019;t just me who thinks that. Let me introduce you, this is Zhou Qianlin. Hera&#x2019;s little sister. They&#x2019;re just very similar. Qianlin, these two are my work partners, Xiuxiu and Ke&#x2019;er.&#x201D;</p><p>Zhou Qianlin gave them both a shy smile. &#x201C;Hello.&#x201D;</p><p>The two women still hadn&#x2019;t totally recovered. They exchanged glances, still unsure of what stood before them.</p><p>&#x201C;You.. you really aren&#x2019;t Hera?&#x201D; Ke&#x2019;er asked.</p><p>Zhou Qianlin gave a small laugh. &#x201C;I&#x2019;m Zhou Qianlin. A student at National Eastern University.&#x201D;</p><p>Ke&#x2019;er pat her chest. When she spoke a tinge of fear still lingered. &#x201C;Oh that scared me! I was going to say, how could Hera survive standing on an exploding planet!&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Ke&#x2019;er!&#x201D; Xiuxiu caught Lan Jue&#x2019;s dark expression, hurrying to shut her up.</p><p>Ke&#x2019;er instantly became aware of her mistake, wincing and sticking out her tongue in embarrassment. &#x201C;Hi, miss Zhou, please come in.&#x201D;</p><p>Lan Jue huffed a small sigh and helplessly shook his head. &#x201C;Xiuxiu, please bring miss Zhou to the back. I&#x2019;ve already prepared some clothes for her. Please have her change. I&#x2019;ve invited her to eat at the Gourmet&#x2019;s tonight.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Right away.&#x201D; Xiuxiu dropped her head respectfully, motioning for Zhou Qianlin to follow.</p><p>Zhou Qianlin followed on her heels. Watching her leave, Ke&#x2019;er then quickly jumped to Lan Jue&#x2019;s side. She put on her gossip voice. &#x201C;Boss! Miss Zhou <em>really</em> isn&#x2019;t Hera? She&apos;s <em>really</em> her sister?&#x201D;</p><p>Lan Jue forced a smile. &#x201C;What do you think? If she were Hera, I&#x2019;d be happier than anyone. Unfortunately that&#x2019;s not the case.&#x201D;</p><p>Ke&#x2019;er leaned in, speaking cryptically. &#x201C;You&#x2019;ve been so different lately boss. You&#x2019;ve been in a better mood. It&#x2019;s because of her, isn&#x2019;t it?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Eh?&#x201D; Lan Jue&#x2019;s eye&#x2019;s narrowed at her.</p><p></p><hr><p></p>
