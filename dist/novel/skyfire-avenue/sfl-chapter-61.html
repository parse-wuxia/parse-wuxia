Make sure they aren&#x2019;t allowed back in.&#x201D;</p><p>She nodded once again, straightening her posture before offering a formal bow. &#x201C;I will be submitting a report concerning this dereliction of duty, and will await punishment.&#x201D;</p><p>Lan Jue lifted his hand, wanting to pat her shoulder. But his hand stopped in the air when he saw her eyes. &#x201C;It&#x2019;s fine, don&#x2019;t be so grave. Off you go, you&#x2019;re busy.&#x201D; He dropped his hand, turned, and made his way in to the jewelry store.</p><p><em>Ting ting ting!</em></p><p>&#x201C;Welcome back boss,&#x201D; Lin Guoguo greeted pleasantly.</p><p>&#x201C;Clever Guoguo. Where&#x2019;s Mika?&#x201D; he asked.</p><p>&#x201C;Mm,&#x201D; Lin Guoguo grunted. &#x201C;She&#x2019;s over there sulking.&#x201D;</p><p>Lan Jue chuckled and made his way behind the counter to spy Mika. He gave her a smile. &#x201C;If you keep getting angry during working hours I&#x2019;m going to have to dock your pay!&#x201D;</p><p>Mika lifted her head to glare at Lan Jue. &#x201C;When have you ever given us a paycheck?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Eh&#x2026;&#x201D; Lan Jue rubbed his nose defensively. &#x201C;I actually don&#x2019;t know how much the store makes&#x2026; but what&#x2019;s mine is yours!&#x201D;</p><p>Mika&#x2019;s eyes adopted a lascivious glint. &#x201C;Is that true for people, too?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Certainly not!&#x201D; Lan Jue straightened with feigned indignation. &#x201C;I&#x2019;m a man of high moral integrity!&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Pfft!&#x201D; The sound didn&#x2019;t just come from Mika.</p><p>Lan Jue rubbed his face. &#x201C;Right, don&#x2019;t be mad. You know why I didn&#x2019;t let you get involved.&#x201D;</p><p>Mika frowned, her voice carrying distinct hints of a pout. &#x201C;To bully me.&#x201D;</p><p>Lan Jue gave her a wry smirk. &#x201C;Your power is simply too dangerous. If you lose control think of what it&#x2019;d do to the Avenue. Don&#x2019;t you like it here?&#x201D;</p><p>Mika shot to her feet. &#x201C;What do you think. Here!&#x201D; She threw a memory stick at Lan Jue.</p><p>&#x201C;The location of the power stone deposit?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Mm.&#x201D; Mika nodded her head.</p><p>&#x201C;You two shouldn&#x2019;t always be so secretive! I get jealous!&#x201D; Lin Guoguo pressed closer, her pink lip jutting forth.</p><p>Mika giggled, throwing her arms around Lin Guoguo and pecking her on the mouth. Lin Guoguo&#x2019;s face grew red, her eyes widening in surprise. She gave Mika a chastising look.</p><p>&#x201C;I didn&#x2019;t see anything. I&#x2019;m leaving.&#x201D; Lan Jue covered his eyes with one hand, and pinched his nose with the other for fear his nose would start bleeding*. He turned quickly and left.</p><p>&#x201C;Coward,&#x201D; Mika mumbled.</p><p>&#x201C;Miikaaa!&#x201D; Lin Guoguo&#x2019;s furious voice rang through the store, causing Mika to jump.</p><p>&#x201C;Fine, fine! I wont make you reciprocate.&#x201D; She quickly dodged around the corner, out of Guoguo&#x2019;s reach.</p><p>&#x201C;You stole my first kiss!&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Nonsense. Didn&#x2019;t you take advantage of him while he slept, kissing him after saving you that one time?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;How did you know!&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;I was only pretending to sleep!&#x201D; Mika said around a devilish smile.</p><p>&#x201C;Mika! I&#x2019;ll <em>kill you!</em>&#x201D;</p><p></p><p style="text-align: center">&#x3B6;</p><p></p><p>Early in the morning, after washing her face and teeth, Zhou Qianlin began her morning run.</p><p>Most were still in the grip of dreams at this time of day. She loved her morning runs; they swept away the sleep from her body, got her blood circulating, so she had spirit for the rest of the day.</p><p>However, compared with her usual demeanor, her mind was racing faster than her body.</p><p>He was an electives teacher, so he needn&#x2019;t come for class every day. She&#x2019;d forgotten to ask yesterday what his schedule was.</p><p>She hadn&#x2019;t thought the guy would so readily help her look after her elderly friends.</p><p>At the memory she couldn&#x2019;t help her pretty face from adopting a small smile.</p><p>&#x201C;What are you thinking about, that&#x2019;s making you smile like a little fox.&#x201D; The voice suddenly arose from behind her, making her jump. She turned her head and spotted someone set not far off, arms crossed over his chest.</p><p>&#x201C;You, what are you doing here?&#x201D; The mountain was home to many of the most rich and notable. The security was supposed to be impeccable.</p><p>Lan Jue spoke up. &#x201C;You know, if this mountain is so hard to get on to, how am I supposed to protect you?&#x201D; He swept his eyes over her figure as he spoke.</p><p>She wore a plain white jumpsuit, and a similarly pale handkerchief pulling her fine black hair in to a ponytail. She wore no make-up, allowing her natural beauty to shine forth.</p><p>Zhou Qianlin frowned. &#x201C;You know this over-inflated ego of yours is terribly unattractive. You don&#x2019;t think I&#x2019;ll call security?&#x201D;</p><p>Lan Jue looked shocked. &#x201C;You wouldn&#x2019;t. I&#x2019;m taking you out to dinner tonight, I deserve some slack.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Hmph!&#x201D; Zhou Qianlin was highly amused by his apparent trepidation. But she quickly recovered. &#x201C;Go on. Why&#x2019;d you come out here so early in the morning.&#x201D;</p><p>Lan Jue chuckled. &#x201C;I&#x2019;m a bodyguard aren&#x2019;t I? Of course I&#x2019;m here to send you to school.&#x201D;</p><p>Zhou Qianlin responded, &#x201C;I find it hard to believe you.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;It&#x2019;s true,&#x201D; he said. &#x201C;I don&#x2019;t have any classes, so I wont be going to the campus. I have something else to take care of. But I figured I&#x2019;d come early to send you there. I&#x2019;ll come back tonight to bring you out to dinner. We can take my bike like yesterday.&#x201D;</p><p>Zhou Qianlin stared at him openmouthed. &#x201C;Well look at you, being responsible!&#x201D;</p><p>Lan Jue stuck his chin out proudly. &#x201C;It&#x2019;s called &#x2018;professional ethics&#x2019;!&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Well then wait for a little while. Let me change then we&#x2019;ll go.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;No hurry. I imagine you haven&#x2019;t eaten breakfast yet. Eat, then we&#x2019;ll leave. I&#x2019;ll wait for you here.&#x201D; Lan Jue smiled at her.</p><p>&#x201C;Alright,&#x201D; she responded, then turned and ran back towards her home.</p><p>Bai Xiao watched her daughter bounce in to the room. It was strange, she thought. &#x201C;What&#x2019;s got you in such a good mood, Linlin?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Am I happy?&#x201D; Zhou Qianlin replied.</p><p>&#x201C;It&#x2019;s been a while since I&#x2019;ve seen that smile from my daughter, like a thousand lilies blooming,&#x201D; came her response.</p><p>Her face grew red, and she stuck her tongue out at her mother. &#x201C;Oh really?&#x201D;</p><p>Bai Xiao nodded earnestly.</p><p>&#x201C;Is breakfast ready, mom?&#x201D; Zhou Qianlin quickly attempted to change the subject.</p><p>&#x201C;Yup. You got back early this morning. Your father just got up.&#x201D;</p><p>Zhou Qianlin giggled. &#x201C;Alright, I&#x2019;ll go eat firs then!&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Sure. Qianlin, do you want the car to send you today?&#x201D;</p><p>Zhou Qianlin gave her mother a helpless look. &#x201C;Mom, why do you ask the same questions every day. Our house and car all belong to the Eastern Alliance. They aren&#x2019;t ours for personal use! I&#x2019;ll send myself to school.&#x201D; She spoke over her shoulder as she made her way to the dining room.</p><p>Watching her daughter&#x2019;s retreating figure Bai Xiao couldn&#x2019;t help but smile. &#x201C;Little minx, you&#x2019;re so pretty! Your mother doesn&#x2019;t feel safe! Although&#x2026; never mind. So long as you&#x2019;re happy. Maybe the breaking of that marriage contract was a good thing.&#x201D;</p><p></p><hr><p></p><p>*A common anime trope, seeing something sexy or exciting causes the viewing character to suffer explosive nose bleeds.</p>
