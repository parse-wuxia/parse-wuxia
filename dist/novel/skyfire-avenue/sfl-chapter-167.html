Instead they made a quick stop at a nearby store.</p><p>The fa&#xE7;ade was a sight more modern than the shops on Skyfire Avenue. The black wall sported a semicircle pattern, with a series of line below it drawn in to a sharp corner.</p><p>Below those, were a series of letters: Wendy Wong.</p><p>&#x201C;Where are we,&#x201D; Qianlin asked. She looked quizzically at Lan Jue.</p><p>&#x201C;The Seamstresses shop! I told you she was urging me to bring you by yesterday. I called ahead and told her you were coming.&#x201D; Lan Jue punctuated the sentence by sauntering towards the shop.</p><p>Zhou Qianlin followed behind. &#x201C;This is a clothing shop?&#x201D;</p><p>Lan Jue replied. &#x201C;In the interest of truth, this is specifically a custom tailor&#x2019;s shop. The Seamstress&#x2019; earnings are very good indeed, and the clothes she makes earn universal praise. I get most of my suits from her.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Great!&#x201D; Qianlin said delightedly.</p><p>The door was closed, prompting Lan Jue to press a button discretely placed to one side. After a few moments, the Seamstress appeared from within.</p><p>She was clad in a fine white shirt with a lacey neckline, tucked stylishly in to black pants. The clothes outlined her slender figure. With her sleeves rolled up, she looked ready to work.</p><p>As she opened the door, the Seamstress beamed a pleasant smile at Zhou Qianlin. &#x201C;Hello, Qianlin. We meet again!&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Hello Seamstress,&#x201D; the young girl responded in equally pleasant tones.</p><p>The Seamstress chuckled. &#x201C;You aren&#x2019;t one of these stuffy Avenue types. Call me by my name, Wendy.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Alright.&#x201D;</p><p>The Seamstress stepped aside, allowing her two guests to enter the shop. It was a small place, by comparison, with only a few mannequins with finished suits dotting the interior.</p><p>The interior wasn&#x2019;t as modern in appearance as the outside suggested. In fact, the decor had a much more classical feel. High-quality planks of wood covered the floors and walls, specialty-made cabinets occupied the corners, a dais with three full-length mirrors dominated the center and an Italian office desk was pushed to one side. It wasn&#x2019;t large, but it screamed refinement. Cozy, would be a fine way to describe it.</p><p>There was another in the shop, other than the Seamstress as the two made their way in. A man, in gray pants and a vest covering a white shirt, sporting a fine tie. He looked resolute and dignified, but with the slightest hint of a wild side.</p><p>He nodded ever so slightly upon seeing Lan Jue. &#x201C;Jewelry Master. It&#x2019;s been a long time.&#x201D;</p><p>Lan Jue was surprised to see the man. &#x201C;Driver, when did you get back? I heard you were out participating in a competition.&#x201D;</p><p>The one they called the Driver smiled. &#x201C;That&#x2019;s right! Once the competition had concluded, I heard the Avenue has a few things on its plate to deal with soon. I rushed back to offer my help.&#x201D;</p><p>Lan Jue nodded in understanding. He turned to Zhou Qianlin, who was standing quietly nearby. &#x201C;This is Skyfire Avenue&#x2019;s resident racecar driver. We call him the Driver. And this is Zhou Qianlin, my friend. She&#x2019;s here to get some clothes done from Wendy.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;I&#x2019;ve actually been waiting here for you,&#x201D; the Driver revealed. &#x201C;Would you like a glass?&#x201D;</p><p>Lan Jue smirked. &#x201C;Sure! And why haven&#x2019;t I ever seen you around the Wine Master&#x2019;s place?&#x201D;</p><p>The Driver shook his head. &#x201C;I&#x2019;m not overly fond of sharing a drink with that old fuddy-duddy. I much prefer drinking with people my own age.&#x201D; He skillfully plucked a few bottles from the nearby cabinet as he spoke, as though he already knew well where everything in the shop was. He placed a couple whisky glasses and the bottles on the Italian table between them.</p><p>&#x201C;And you, Miss Zhou?&#x201D; The Driver raised a questioning brow towards the young woman.</p><p>She smiled back at him. &#x201C;Water is fine for me, thank you.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Very well.&#x201D; He answered by producing a bottle of water and putting it before her. Lan Jue took a seat opposite him.</p><p>The Seamstress snatched up Zhou Qianlin&#x2019;s hand and pulled her toward the back before she had a chance to sit. She pulled shut a curtain to give them some privacy. &#x201C;Let me take your measurements. Don&#x2019;t pay any attention to the boys.&#x201D;</p><p>The Driver indicated the bottles he extricated from the cabinet. &#x201C;Which would you like?&#x201D;</p><p>Lan Jue shot his companion a big thumbs-up. &#x201C;You are certainly more fun to drink with. At the very least you aren&#x2019;t as stingy as the Wine Master.&#x201D;</p><p>The Driver&#x2019;s bright laughter filled the store. &#x201C;Make sure you tell him that the next time you see him.&#x201D;</p><p>Lan Jue snickered as he took up a previously opened bottle. He pulled the cork free and poured himself and the Driver a small bit. &#x201C;We&#x2019;ll try this one first, an eighteen-year Glenfiddich. It&#x2019;s got a smoother taste. Only malt whisky of the highlands.&#x201D;</p><p>The Driver smiled at his drinking buddy&#x2019;s expertise. &#x201C;Starting easy, it looks like your plan is to finish everything in front of you!&#x201D;</p><p>Lan Jue tapped his glass against the Driver&#x2019;s, the crystalline chime hanging between them. &#x201C;You took them all out right? If I don&#x2019;t drink them, you&#x2019;ll lose face!&#x201D;</p><p>Both of them lapsed in to silence as they partook of the rich golden liquid. Its warmth filled their bellies, spreading out to cover their whole bodies in a comfortable heat. The rich malt scent opened up their pores.</p><p>Lan Jue sighed contentedly. &#x201C;A little while ago I&#x2019;d asked the Wine Master to drink his 1985 Talisker with me. He got so upset he almost kicked me out, so we settled on a Talisker 18.&#x201D;</p><p>The Driver laughed. &#x201C;That certainly sounds like the crotchety old man. With all the liquor he has, you could drink yourself blind every night and still have enough to last a lifetime. He doesn&#x2019;t get it; you spend all your time trying to get <em>more</em> great alcohol, you&#x2019;ll never be satisfied with actually drinking it.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;He isn&#x2019;t entirely wrong though,&#x201D; Lan Jue said in the old man&#x2019;s defense. &#x201C;After all, most of the great alcohol from the former era can&#x2019;t be reproduced. Drink it, and it&#x2019;s gone forever.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;I hear your recent visit to Taihua was a dangerous one,&#x201D; the Driver said, changing the subject.</p><p>Lan Jue nodded. &#x201C;Yup. I was still recovering from an earlier injury, and was lucky I got back. Fortunately, the Doctor and Wine Master rushed over and saved me. If they hadn&#x2019;t we wouldn&#x2019;t be sharing this fine bottle.&#x201D;</p><p>The Driver shook his head. &#x201C;More specifically, no one with an even temper to share this bottle with. Come, another glass.&#x201D;</p><p>They finished off their small glass before the Driver reached out to snatch up the second bottle. He didn&#x2019;t bother to change the glass before pouring out another round for the two of them.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;For our second bottle, we have a very traditional McCarran 25. Rare and excellent,&#x201D; the Driver explained.</p><p>Lan Jue nodded. &#x201C;Indeed! The McCarran label has a long heritage stretching back it to the Former Era. It was called the King of Whiskies. In fact, not everyone enjoyed it&#x2019;s fair and placid taste. But at this age it has a beautiful rich flavor, and a lingering after-taste that comes in layers. Complicated. I myself am a very big fan. And when drinking spirits, we&#x2019;re doing it properly &#x2013; one doesn&#x2019;t need to finish the entire bottle in one sitting, and in fact can try a breadth of whiskies by spreading them out. Different beverages give the drinker a different sensation, yes? It doesn&#x2019;t have as many rules and requirements as red wine to properly enjoy.&#x201D;</p><p>Within the back room.</p><p>The Seamstress continuously praised her younger counterpart as she busily measured Qianlin&#x2019;s figure. &#x201C;Oh, your figure really is perfect. Perfectly proportional, it&#x2019;s uncanny. And all the charms of a proper woman to boot.&#x201D;</p><p>Zhou Qianlin&#x2019;s pretty face adopted a blush. &#x201C;You&#x2019;re too kind, Miss Wendy.&#x201D;</p><p></p><hr><p></p>
