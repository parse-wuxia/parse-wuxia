<p></p><p style="text-align: center"><strong>Chapter 65: The Gourmet&#x2019;s Boutique</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>&#xA0;</strong></p><p>Elegant dinner jacket, knee-length white skirt, all the same hue, all masterfully made. Her pretty face was lined with silken black hair, and her blue eyes &#x2013; the color of the sea &#x2013; twinkled radiantly. She was like a painting, beautiful and moving.</p><p>&#x201C;Not bad.&#x201D; Lan Jue nodded his head approvingly.</p><p>Zhou Qianlin&#x2019;s face grew red. No young woman could resist pretty clothing. &#x201C;Thank you.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;You&#x2019;re young. It wouldn&#x2019;t do to accessories with jewelry that&#x2019;s too fancy. A simple necklace will suffice.&#x201D; Lan Jue smiled softly.</p><p>She shook her head. &#x201C;I&#x2019;m not interested in any jewelry.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Jewelry is a woman&#x2019;s best companion. Wearing jewelry isn&#x2019;t about displaying wealth or luxury, but to set off your own natural beauty. Your clothes are cut with a v-neck. It&#x2019;s not deep, but it requires a necklace. It&#x2019;ll show off your complexion, and even further improve the disposition you exude.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;I guess I&#x2019;ll wear one then.&#x201D; Zhou Qianlin fumbled through her bag to produce a small pouch. She opened it and produced the Soul Speaker gem Lan Jue had given her earlier.</p><p>Lan Jue looked surprised. &#x201C;I&#x2019;d actually prepared you a nice sapphire necklace.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;No need, I&#x2019;ll wear this,&#x201D; she insisted.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Alright then.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Help me put it on.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Lan Jue took up the necklace and positioned himself behind Zhou Qianlin. He slipped the necklace around her throat and fastened it.</p><p>It was simple, unadorned, with no fine metals or ornamenting gemstones. The soul speaker gem itself emitted a gentle yellow light, but it did not clash. It added the final touch, highlighting Zhou Qianlin&#x2019;s pure and simple temperament.</p><p>&#x201C;Let&#x2019;s go.&#x201D; Lan Jue offered his right arm, and Zhou Qianlin responded by slipping her hand around his elbow. They pushed the door open and stepped out.</p><p></p><p style="text-align: center">&#x3B6;</p><p></p><p>&#x201C;I really had no idea Hera had a little sister,&#x201D; Ke&#x2019;er was saying. She turned her head when Xiuxiu offered no response.</p><p>Xiuxiu&#x2019;s frail form, stooped over the counter, jerked suddenly.</p><p>&#x201C;Xiuxiu, what&#x2019;s wrong?&#x201D; Ke&#x2019;er hastened to her side.</p><p>&#x201C;I&#x2019;m fine,&#x201D; she responded, though her voice was hoarse.</p><p>Realization came over Ke&#x2019;er suddenly as she looked at her co-worker. &#x201C;You&#x2019;re worried about the boss and miss Zhou. She isn&#x2019;t Hera! Don&#x2019;t think too much.&#x201D;</p><p>Xiuxiu gently shook her head, sitting a little straighter. She rubbed away a tear that had begun to creep down her face. But it didn&#x2019;t hide her reddening eyes.</p><p>&#x201C;But she looks exactly like her.&#x201D;</p><p>Ke&#x2019;er spoke softly to her. &#x201C;But that doesn&#x2019;t make her Hera. Think about it. Her voice, her mood, her mannerisms all are different. Not to mention younger. But I don&#x2019;t know why the boss found her.&#x201D;</p><p>Xiuxiu shook her head sheepishly. &#x201C;I&#x2019;m sorry Ke&#x2019;er. I think too much.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Ke&#x2019;er wrapped her arms around Xiuxiu and gave her a hug. She sighed as she continued. &#x201C;Xiuxiu, I&#x2019;ve actually been wanting to tell you&#x2026; when the boss looks at us, every time you can see how much he cares!&#x201D;</p><p>Xiuxiu lifted her head, and that normally tender light in her eyes was undercut by a current of determination.</p><p></p><p style="text-align: center">&#x3B6;</p><p></p><p>If one were trying to find the most unimpressive structure on Skyfire Avenue, the old Chinese-style shop with it&#x2019;s carved purple door would probably be it.</p><p>It couldn&#x2019;t accurately be described as a shop. Only a minority of Skyfire&#x2019;s residents understood that this particular building held the greatest delicacies on the planet. It was, after all, the Gourmet&#x2019;s personal boutique, not open to the public.</p><p>The store here on the Avenue and it&#x2019;s sister in Skyfire Underground were as alike as apples to oysters. While this one was small and narrow, the Undergrounds was no less expansive than the Keeper&#x2019;s pharmacy &#x2013; and that place served nearly all the Adepts who visited Skyfire. This place was simply used for the Gourmet to entertain friends.</p><p>Lan Jue pulled open the door and motioned for Zhou Qianlin to enter.</p><p>As Qianlin entered she was immediately met with a distinct fragrance. It wasn&#x2019;t pungent, but unique. It almost filled her up.</p><p>A long, simple wooden table stretched the length of the room, and at it&#x2019;s sides sat five people. As she made her way inside, every pair of eyes turned to fall upon her.</p><p>Zhou Qianlin felt like a pauper beneath their gaze, but each rose politely to greet her. They all nodded and spoke kind, respectful greetings.</p><p>Lan Jue had entered at that point, and stood at her side. &#x201C;When there&#x2019;s good food you all certainly don&#x2019;t waste any time! Introductions, this is my friend Zhou Qianlin.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Hello everyone,&#x201D; she greeted with a small smile, nodding to those gathered.</p><p>Lan Jue pointed to the one furthest from them, dressed meticulously with the head of silver hair. &#x201C;This is our Wine Master, who manages the Gothic Winery on the Avenue.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Nice to meet you,&#x201D; she said again politely.</p><p>&#x201C;Welcome, beautiful lady.&#x201D; The Wine Master stepped forward, and in accordance with noble custom bent to kiss her hand.</p><p>Lan Jue continued, indicating a tall and stocky man in his forties. He rose a good head taller than Lan Jue, and his white shirt was stretched taught over his stalwart frame. His face was craggy, his skin tanned bronze, covered with a finely sculpted beard.</p><p>&#x201C;This is our Mechanist. We also call him the Blacksmith.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Hello,&#x201D; she said gracefully.</p><p>The Blacksmith bubbled with laughter. &#x201C;This is the first time the Jewelry Master has brought someone along, welcome!&#x201D; He did not move forward, but instead gave her an amicable nod.</p><p>&#x201C;This is our Coffee Master.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;And our Tailor.&#x201D; Lan Jue indicated the other woman present besides Zhou Qianlin.</p><p>The Tailor was herself a beautiful woman, of medium build with long brown hair. She was clad in a simple white blouse with the sleeves rolled to her arms and a tight black skirt.</p><p>Upon introductions her eyes grew bright. &#x201C;Qianlin, you really are gorgeous. I simply have make you some clothes.&#x201D;</p><p>Zhou Qianlin laughed prettily. &#x201C;Thank you very much, miss Tailor.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Please sit,&#x201D; Lan Jue said, pulling free a chair for her.</p><p>Zhou Qianlin hesitated. &#x201C;But there&#x2019;s one other you haven&#x2019;t introduced.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;That one doesn&#x2019;t need an introduction,&#x201D; Lan Jue said casually, &#x201C;so as to save us all his blathering.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Jewelry Master! My best friend!&#x201D; An agitated voice bubbled up from across the table, a pale man with indignant expression. His voice was muffled from the lollipop stuck between his lips.</p><p>He stood and made his way towards Zhou Qianlin, his expression changing to adopt a wide smile. He began speaking fast enough to make Zhou Qianlin dizzy. &#x201C;Hello there pretty lady, I am the universally popular and wisest among us. You an call me: the Accountant! Do you have a boyfriend? It&#x2019;s can&#x2019;t be this Jewelry Master right? Don&#x2019;t be fooled by his finery, inside he&#x2019;s all rubbish. A normal plebian. But me, I&#x2019;m the young one with all the potential!&#x201D;</p><p></p><hr><p></p>
