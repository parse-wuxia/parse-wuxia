<p></p><p style="text-align: center"><b>Chapter 771: Three Teams</b></p><p></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Every planet has at least one powerful progenitor. They are the root of the aliens&#x2019; aggression and consumption power. I also believe they&#x2019;re chiefly responsible for the infection that poisons our people. Killing them will at least ensure that no more people are transformed. Meanwhile our soldiers will push the main attack which will keep the alien forces busy, too distracted to retaliate against the innocent humans. Maybe we can save these people.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Who knows if we&#x2019;ll win the final battle; this plan may just be prolonging the inevitable. But if this is to be humanity&#x2019;s final moments then we must do everything we can. This is my plan.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The gathered Paragons quietly listened to his speech. When Lan Jue went into detail as to how he planned to save these people, Satan and the Pontiff looked at him with genuine surprise. They were Westerners, and the condition of these people were their direct concern. Meanwhile their governments and organizations were never friendly. On the contrary, the West had routinely tried to cause trouble for its Eastern counterpart.</span></p><p><span style="">They&#x2019;d assumed that their army&#x2019;s presence here was all about self-preservation. If they won the benefits to them were clear. But when they heard him speak with such passion their opinions changed. They were willing to risk their lives to save people from another Alliance! It was completely impractical from a military standpoint. Nor was this a ploy to curry favor, since the West was effectively destroyed. Who would they hope to gain favor with?</span></p><p><span style="">It was as simple as people needing help, and them being in a position to give it. Satan and the Pontiff shared a glance, and both could see their surprise and disbelief mirror in the other&#x2019;s eyes.</span></p><p><span style="">Lan Jue continued. &#x201C;I want everyone to understand the dangers we will face. Based on our experience each of these planets should have a planetary doppelganger or royal alien as a defender. They will at least be equivalent to a Paragon of the third degree, Nirvana &#x2013; I expect some will have achieved the Infinite. What&#x2019;s more, there will definitely be lesser aliens planet-side that help them. The progenitors themselves will likely be Paragon-strength.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;So, I believe it necessary to combine our strength in order to kill these monsters. If at all possible, we should try to kill their powerful defenders as well. We can save our fellow humans and weaken the enemy all in one stroke. Each one we take down improved the chances for our main force.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Our plan of attack calls for the armada to take and occupy one of the larger planets to serve as a base. This will be our first target. Once the target&#x2019;s been killed we&#x2019;ll move on to the next one. Based on current strength I think we can break into two teams, this will ensure a higher level of safety. Are there any questions, ladies and gentlemen?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The Skyfire Avenue Paragons remained silent. Lan Jue had already proved himself to them. He had everyone&#x2019;s utmost trust and respect. They were also not suited for interstellar combat. It didn&#x2019;t play to their strengths.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I support the plan.&#x201D; Satan was the first to speak.</span></p><p><span style="">The Pontiff slowly nodded his head, looking at Lan Jue with solemn eyes. If he had the opportunity he would have torn this young man apart &#x2013; he had been responsible for a great deal of suffering for his organization. Now, however, in the face of destruction enemies became friends. They had a common foe that they could not face on their own. The time for personal grudges was past.</span></p><p><span style="">The Terminator also nodded. &#x201C;As do I.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Two teams isn&#x2019;t going to work.&#x201D; Jue Di was the voice of dissention. As the strongest among them, his voice bore the most weight.</span></p><p><span style="">Jue Di looked at his son and spoke with a matter-of-fact tone. &#x201C;Three teams. I will be responsible for three planets myself. The remainder will be up to the rest of you, two planets each.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">If anyone other than Jue Di had been so brazen as to make the suggestion, especially before such a gathering of Paragons, they would have caused an uproar. But this man wasn&#x2019;t just anyone &#x2013; wasn&#x2019;t just any Paragon. When he spoke everyone felt compelled to listen.</span></p><p><span style="">Lan Jue looked anxiously at his father. He wanted to say something, but thought better of it.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Alright. That being the case let me set up the groups. His Majesty Jue Di will be team one, and will be responsible for three of the planets. For the remainder, his Majesty the Terminator will be leading one group. This group will be comprised of the Pontiff, Satan, the Cosmagus, the Epochrion, the Arcane Magnate, the Karmic Scholar and the God of Wine. Eight Paragons in total. The third group will be led by the Photographer. She will be commanding the Arhat of the Descending Dragon, the Driver, the Pharmacist, the Infernal Vanguard, Qianlin, and myself.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">As he listened, the Terminator seemed apprehensive. Although the Photographer had achieved Nirvana like him, the groups seemed stilted. His own team was comprised of eight Paragons, with the Cosmagus and the Epochrion both being Reflections of Heaven and Earth. Although Neither the Pontiff nor Satan were of the same strength, they were well-versed in the world of protogenia.</span></p><p><span style="">But the team Lan Jue was in had only five Paragons. Only the Photographer had achieved Nirvana while the rest were only part of the Realm of Protogenia. Lan Jue and Qianlin where not even Paragons. With Jue Di they would have been fine, but without the man their team seemed weak.</span></p><p><span style="">With his brows furrowed, the Terminator shared his concern. &#x201C;Perhaps you should add another Paragon to your team. We can manage will one less.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">But Lan Jue shook his head. &#x201C;Thank you, your Majesty, but to be honest with you Qianlin and I will be achieving our breakthrough very soon. We will have seven Paragons then. Qianlin and I also have a special style we employ together, so I believe this group is sufficient. In addition we will be responsible for helping the armada take their first planet and will have the help of Star Division thereafter, hence my grouping decision. So long as we&#x2019;re together we&#x2019;ll be fine.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Hearing this, the Terminator had no more problems.</span></p><p><span style="">Of course Lan Jue had his reasons for choosing these teams. For a start he could not be on the same team as the Terminator, Satan or the Pontiff. It wasn&#x2019;t that he didn&#x2019;t trust them, but that he didn&#x2019;t want them to witness his breakthrough with Qianlin. They were allies in this fight, but some secrets had to be kept.</span></p><p><span style="">His team also had the Pharmacist and Occisus. Her skill on the battlefield was no less impressive than a Reflection of Heaven and Earth. The Driver&#x2019;s yin-yang lightning was similarly imposing. In a fight, the strength of those two was undisputed. With the addition of him and Qianlin and their Harmonious Sword technique, the team was anything but weak.</span></p><p><span style="">Though both the Photographer and the Terminator had achieved Nirvana, they were different. She had been immersed in the power of her station for many years. Were it not for fear of universal protogenia, breaking through to the Infinite under Jue Di&#x2019;s tutelage was not out of the question. With her leading the team, they could also teleport to safety if things became too overwhelming. </span></p><p><span style="">The team were set. All that was left were final preparations for the operation.</span></p><p><span style="">Jue Di had chosen three neighboring planets to be responsible for. He didn&#x2019;t seem at all troubled by the scale of his job. Only a few of those in attendance knew how powerful the man truly was. However, they were all Paragons. The deep and mighty aura that surrounded him was felt by all.</span></p><p><span style="">The other two teams also discussed their targets and made their decisions. Once finished the Paragons broke into their individual teams to discuss specifics. Jue Di participated in Luo Xianni&#x2019;s team.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Father, your health&#x2026;&#x201D; Once the Terminator and the others left, Lan Jue broached the subject.</span></p><p><span style="">Jue Di silenced him with a wave of his hand. &#x201C;This is hardly the time to worry about that. Besides that crystal has been helpful. At the least it will help to employ my power. Perhaps I will be able to get more crystals to help me further. In the end this is likely the best decision for me, so you don&#x2019;t need to fret over it. So long as everything goes according to plan we&#x2019;ll be fine. Those planets and their denizens won&#x2019;t trouble me unless the home worlds themselves appear.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Alright, but look after yourself.&#x201D; Lan Jue cautioned.</span></p><p><span style="">Jue Di chuckled at the concern in his son&#x2019;s eyes. &#x201C;Look after your mother and make sure she doesn&#x2019;t do anything rash.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Luo Xianni sniffed. &#x201C;Rash? Why don&#x2019;t you say what you want to say, eh Chi Bupang?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Jue Di rolled his eyes. &#x201C;Come now, you don&#x2019;t think I know you by now? The same goes for you, protect my son and daughter in law. Call if they run into a problem!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yeah I&#x2019;ll call alright, I&#x2019;ll shout right in your face!&#x201D; Her words were harsh, but her eyes never left Jue Di&#x2019;s face. The faint light of concern hid behind her disdainful expression. Even she wasn&#x2019;t sure about her spouse&#x2019;s condition.</span></p><p><span style="">After years of cultivation in the Infinite Jue Di was at the margin of what was permitted by natural law. However, unlike the alien home worlds he had no way to conceal it from the universe and its uncaring retribution. Though he had the knowledge and power to rise to new heights, he knew it would mean immediate destruction.</span></p><p><span style="">Yet, with the potential of facing increasingly powerful enemies would he be able to hold his powers back? Luo Xianni wasn&#x2019;t sure she could, much less Chi Bupang.</span></p><p><span style="">They would only know when the time came.</span></p><p><span style="">Three bastions and twelve interstellar fleets spread out in formation. They quietly cut through the darkness of space toward the seven Western planets.</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p>
