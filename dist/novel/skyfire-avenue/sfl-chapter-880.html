She used to tell us that love isn&#x2019;t something you can manage. She always loved you. You would protect her if she were bullied, and help keep her head high &#x2013; no matter the cost. She remembered that. And the times she would dress up as your bride when you played as children.

Her mood was always off. When Hera was gone and we came to you, to help you recover, we all thought the two of you would come together in time. Instead you fell apart. Xiuxiu saw what it did to you and cried every night. But she never cried in front of you.&#x201D;</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&#x201C;When you snapped out of your stupor no one was happier than Xiuxiu.

All I see what I find in Ultus&#x2019; memories, and I&#x2019;ve found nothing about what the Strategy will really do.

Enough in fact to empower you to the Infinite, I&#x2019;d think. But that&#x2019;s not the way to do it. Your bodies wouldn&#x2019;t be able to withstand the massive amount of pressure placed on them. Little Yue told me Lan Jue and Qianlin have broken through a series of grades very quickly. Pressing that process any further would be dangerous. But once they do break through to the Infinite, I don&#x2019;t think they would be in any danger of a power backlash from the swords. Absorbing and assimilating protogenia takes time, and you&#x2019;re already moving quickly. Going too fast will have consequences, not least of which the universe itself. You won&#x2019;t know what it is to suffer the pressure of universal protogenia until you become one with the Infinite. Under those conditions the power you could command wouldn&#x2019;t be at the Infinite level. You&#x2019;d be lucky to command the power of Nirvana. First, before we do anything, you all need to reach Nirvana. Once you do we can attempt the Strategy. Then we&#x2019;ll see if anything else needs to be done.&#x201D;</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lan Qing nodded.

To try and offset this they threw all their resources into repairing their fastest ship. It packed a punch as well. As for other reinforcements it would be some time before they showed up. Luckily Angel&#x2019;s food stores were well stocked, and there were no fear of the citizens revolting. They&#x2019;d started building neighborhoods.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Of course they made announcements of their victories during the campaign. This boosted moral and gladdened the hearts of the people. Video of the clashes were spread far and wide, filling the humans with hope.

Some were already voicing skepticism, saying that there were too few soldiers to prevail. Why weren&#x2019;t all of the North&#x2019;s eight bastions out there fighting for mankind?</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Why weren&#x2019;t there reinforcements for these soldiers who&#x2019;ve been battling on the front lines so long already?

The evolution had to be stopped, and both the monsters&#x2019; soldiers and generals were bloodied. With the addition of Heron they were sufficiently reinforced, according to him.

What he proposed was a two-prong attack. If they could succeed with a purely military victory than that would be great, and the Banishing Swords could be kept as a backup. If they fail at least they&#x2019;ll have succeeded in weakening the enemy further. Perhaps that&#x2019;d improve the Easterners&#x2019; chances.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&#xA0;His proposal passed unanimously. Even the commander representing the Eastern army in Lan Qing&#x2019;s absence agreed. Poseidon Group didn&#x2019;t share an opinion.

He was hoping to gain An Lun&#x2019;s favor. The Northern leader could see the East&#x2019;s rise to prominence, inevitable assuming they were able to defeat the aliens. Considering their high-powered fighters alone, the North could not catch up or hope to contend. They had an advantage technologically, but maintaining a force of notable Adepts was going to be difficult.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If Middle Heaven was any indication the East&#x2019;s technological mastery was not as backwater as they&#x2019;d expected.

Qianlin&#x2019;s Queen of Heaven Discipline should help them significantly there. Afterwards all four of you should undergo this process.

Poseidon&#x2019;s spectacular metamorphic abilities were staggering, but the family&#x2019;s ship still didn&#x2019;t match up to the war planet. Middle Heaven&#x2019;s Terminal Ray was a truly terrifying weapon of mass destruction.

In their mind&#x2019;s eye they could see the scene of their triumphant return, with ticker tape parades and flower petals descending from the sky.

The enemy was steadily losing ground. Nothing indicated the home worlds were getting involved, either. Europa was still hidden beneath the cloud of caustic purple fog that made it look like a fantastical land from the story books. By contrast the three planets looked like hideous tumors affixed to the planet&#x2019;s surface. Aside from the roiling tides of the clouds, nothing moved. They seemed completely devoid of life.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Kang Hui pressed a button on his control panel.

On the contrary, he was all the more vigilant. From the very beginning the aliens had enjoyed the advantage. Right up until this point humanity had been against the ropes, only to suddenly see a reverse in fortune. It was important to remember that it wasn&#x2019;t Lan Qing&#x2019;s brilliance alone that got them to this point, however. An important factor was the fact that the home worlds were not involved in the fighting.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If they had been even Lan Qing couldn&#x2019;t have spun gold out of straw.

Quite the opposite, the planets were laden with the life force of eight planets and all the vitality they stole from the Northern Alliance. They hadn&#x2019;t used any of that energy in battle against the humans and instead funneled it into their evolutionary process. Kang Hui shuddered to think what sort of power this new creation would wield once its evolution was complete.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It went without saying that Kang Hui didn&#x2019;t find their chances appealing if the home worlds chose to fight. His loss at their hands was still acutely carved into his memory, an angry scar to remind him of his defeat. Their variable offense and impenetrable protection made them virtually impossible to shake off. They were as strong as they were cunning, and used whatever advantage available to win victory over their prey. As such humans had consistently been beaten back.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">And so Kang Hui called off his focus to bear. Heron was their weakest bastion, but also charged its main weapons system fastest. As the fastest ship in the fleet it made for a natural choice to use as an opening gambit.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lan Qing had told him that the home worlds had mostly fused with Europa by this point.

Tyrannosaurus, Poseidon and Middle Heaven all began to charge their primary weapons. Heron&#x2019;s attack was a feeler, to see how the planets would react. Once they got a read they could follow up with shots from the others bastions. He was confident that one round of attacks, if it didn&#x2019;t destroy Europa outright, would at least severely affect the home worlds&#x2019; evolution. That would be enough, and they could focus on a more comprehensive attack. The greatest result would be to damage the planet enough so that the evolution process was stopped entirely. Then, under concentrated fire, they could destroy the enemy outright.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At least for the moment his plan seemed to be working.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Heron shook as three beams of cyan light fired from its cannons. It erupted with such intensity that space rippled around the guns&#x2019; barrels. While the weapon wasn&#x2019;t as strong as Tyrannosaurus&#x2019;, say, it was still a bastion&#x2019;s weapon.

Heron proved their leaders were committed to reinforcing the heroes of the front lines. In this they were better than the East.
