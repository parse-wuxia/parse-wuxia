Mika, give the man his money.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Yes, sir,&#x201D; Mika replied. She produced a handful of yellow notes; the highest denomination of NED available, ten thousands dollars a note. She gave the man five.</p><p>The hooded man took his money, his face hidden in shadow. Wordlessly he turned, and made to leave.</p><p>&#x201C;Wait a minute,&#x201D; Lan Jue called after him.</p><p>&#x201C;Our business is concluded,&#x201D; the man replied. His voice was strange, clearly altered by a voice modulator. &#x201C;According to the rules of Skyfire Avenue, we have no further association.&#x201D;</p><p>Lan Jue nodded in agreement. &#x201C;Absolutely, but if I offered to pay you for information about the origin of that stone, we&#x2019;d be entering in to another business arrangement.&#x201D;</p><p>The hooded man seemed to sigh, and shaking his head pushed open the lightning-emblazoned door of the jewelry shop. However, he did not pass through it. In the contrary, he retreated several steps, his body rigid.</p><p>From without three men entered through the door he&#x2019;d opened.</p><p>The foremost man was clad in black leather, a hooded jacket over all and a black mask. All that was revealed was a pair of shining, intelligent eyes. The two men behind him were dressed similarly, though they wore no hoods.</p><p>&#x201C;Where is it, Oliver?&#x201D; The resonating voice of the leader asked the man in green. Though he asked, his eyes caressing the box set before Lan Jue revealed the question as rhetorical.</p><p>Without warning, the man in green side-stepped the leather-clad intruders and threw a single punch at the leader, trying to knock him out.</p><p><em>Bang!</em> The black-hooded intruder raised his arm to block the attack, and in that moment a squall of wind tore through the store.</p><p>&#x201C;Enough!&#x201D; Mika&#x2019;s clear voice rang through the shop, and she approached them indignation clearly written on her face. &#x201C;Are you not aware of the rules here?!&#x201D;</p><p>The two hooded men dropped their hands. The one in black growled, &#x201C;Mind your own damn business. I know you can&#x2019;t fight in Skyfire Avenue. But we aren&#x2019;t on the Avenue, are we.&#x201D;</p><p>Lan Jue, sitting a short distance from them, sighed faintly. &#x201C;It would appear our safeguards against rule-breakers have been insufficient of late. Where are all you troublemakers coming from. Mika, if you would please show them the door. Have the enforcers deal with them.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Absolutely, sir!&#x201D;</p><p>Her right leg shot out. In her tiny skirt, the gentlemen thought they might be granted a quick peek. However, before they could have the opportunity to appreciate the view, they found the world before them engulfed in red.</p><p>All of them, including the man in green, found themselves enveloped by the flame-red light to the point where they didn&#x2019;t even have room to struggle before collapsing to the floor.</p><p>Mika waved her left hand, and in response the door to Zeus&#x2019; Jewelry Shop opened of it&#x2019;s own accord. One by one, she literally kicked the four prostrate men from the store.</p><p>Mika strode towards the door, hands on her hips. She shouted out in to the street. &#x201C;Are the enforcers all on lunch break? Come fetch this garbage!&#x201D; She turned, disregarding the host of stares earned from the Adepts wandering the street, and walked back inside slamming the door behind her.</p><p>&#x201C;So fierce,&#x201D; Lan Jue teased, covering his face with his hands in feigned discomfort.</p><p>Lin Guanguan giggled. &#x201C;You&#x2019;ve spoiled her, boss!&#x201D;</p><p>Lan Jue chortled. &#x201C;A little fierce is good! You have to protect yourself from bullies. I must say though, Mika, you should employ a different method next time. Kicking your legs in such a short skirt is so unbecoming of a lady.&#x201D;</p><p>Mika responded with a flirtatious look. &#x201C;Oh boss, they didn&#x2019;t see anything&#x2026; I just wanted to give you a show.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;No thank you,&#x201D; he said, standing. &#x201C;I&#x2019;m terrified you&#x2019;ll burn me too. I&#x2019;m heading out, but by the way I ran in to Chu Cheng a few days ago. You know he thinks about you all the time! Would you not give my poor older brother some consideration?&#x201D;</p><p>Mika&#x2019;s playful expression shifted, a bitterness crept in to her voice. &#x201C;If you aren&#x2019;t interested don&#x2019;t throw me away to just anyone. If you force me to go with him, I might as well die right now.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;All right! Pretend I didn&#x2019;t say anything,&#x201D; Lan Jue said, rubbing his forehead. He felt pity for his brother. But more, if his brother was just &#x2018;anybody&#x2019;, what did that make him? Ugh, this girl!</p><p>Lin Guanguan and Mika accompanied Lan Jue to the surface elevator. Mika spoke to her counterpart. &#x201C;Look after the store, Guanguan. I&#x2019;ll go to the enforcers and follow up.&#x201D; For many things she was able to make the proper decisions and didn&#x2019;t require Lan Jue&#x2019;s direct instruction. Among Lan Jue&#x2019;s four employees, she was certainly the most qualified in all aspects.</p><p>Lan Jue returned topside, the lead casing clutched in his hands. This power gem would require some careful research to verify.</p><p>The elevator went directly to Zeus&#x2019; surface shop, but didn&#x2019;t stop, instead moving on until it reached the Library. He and the Keeper had made an appointment.</p><p>Despite his good disposition from obtaining the gem and Harlequin Silver, his mood darkened when he remembered what he wanted to speak with the Keeper about. <em>More than two years</em> he thought, <em>two years of my life!</em></p><p>The Library situated on Skyfire Avenue&#x2019;s upper level was very small, about the same area as Zeus&#x2019; Jewelry Store. But compared to the Winery, or the Museum, it was miniscule.</p><p>What the unaware would never suspect, however, was that what lay beneath the surface was a building dedicated to the cultivation techniques of all the Avenue&#x2019;s Adepts. And it was massive.</p><p>The Keeper sat upon a recliner, rocking back and forth before the door of the Library. A rattan tea table was situated beside him, and on it sat a dark red teapot. In comparison to the pot Lan Jue&#x2019;d used at the Luo Yun teahouse, this one had a thicker and smoother lacquer coating, making it clear it was used quite often.</p><p>&#x201C;Come, take a seat. Now what reason would you have to come talk to an old man like me! A young fella like you, I doubt you&#x2019;d come knocking for no reason.&#x201D; The old man smiled amicable towards Lan Jue as he spoke. No matter the guest, the Keeper always greeting everyone with a smile.</p><p>Lan Jue offered a small smile of his own. &#x201C;Originally it had been only one thing. Now I&#x2019;m afraid there&#x2019;s a second matter I need to ask about.&#x201D;</p><p></p><hr><p></p>
