<p></p><p style="text-align: center"><strong>Chapter 18: A Place Called A Hospital</strong></p><p></p><p>She lay against his wide, sturdy chest, the kind that made people feel safe.</p><p>Her lily-white, gem encrusted dress; her exquisite tiara; her dazzling tecnicolor veil. All had been cast beside the sofa.</p><p>He gently stroked her hair, which had already begun to unravel. Three years of suffering, poured out in a day. Despite her illness, he shut his eyes in relief.</p><p>He didn&#x2019;t see her brows furrow, or her bite her lip, but the shift in muscle was felt beneath his fingertips. &#x201C;What is it, Jinyu. Why knit your brow?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Do you know who I am? Who&#x2019;s here to cure you?&#x201D; Lan Jue&#x2019;s deep voice asked. &#x201C;It doesn&#x2019;t matter who it was, they&#x2019;ll pay for what they did to you.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Do you really know me?&#x201D; Zhou Qianlin quavering voice asked.</p><p>&#x201C;Huh?&#x201D; Lan Jue turned her over in his arms, looking in to her eyes.</p><p>Zhou Qianlin lifted her head to regard him, looking at him in earnest. It felt as though his face had been branded in to her mind.</p><p>&#x201C;Of course I know who you are. You&#x2019;re my wife. My Hera. My Jinyu. Zhou Jinyu.&#x201D;</p><p>She shook her head. &#x201C;I-I&#x2019;m not Zhou Jinyu. I&#x2019;m Zhou Qianlin.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Wha-&#x201C; Lan Jue started, moving to sit by her side and looking at her closely. No, it was definitely Hera! Black hair, blue eyes&#x2026; How could she not know who she was? Even her scent, exactly as it was before.</p><p>&#x201C;Beloved&#x2026; Is it, amnesia?&#x201D; Lan Jue asked with uncertainty.</p><p>Zhou Qianlin drew the covers closer, saying quietly, &#x201C;Can I ask you something?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Anything,&#x201D; Lan Jue replied.</p><p>Zhou Qianlin&#x2019;s eyes shone as she looked at him. &#x201C;You said this Jinyu is your wife&#x2026; then&#x2026; you&#x2019;ve had relations before?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Of course! You really don&apos;t know?&#x201D; Lan Jue was unconvinced.</p><p>Zhou Qianlin nodded her head, then moved the comforter to the side. She pulled them from Lan Jue&#x2019;s body.</p><p>Zhou Qianlin&apos;s fair features grew red, and she turned her face to avoid looking at him. Her hand slipped from beneath the sheets and pointed. &#x201C;Well, then look at this.&#x201D;</p><p>A sense of trepidation filled Lan Jue&#x2019;s heart. When he dropped his head to look, he was nearly petrified.</p><p>There, he saw a fresh smear of red.</p><p>It was quiet, quiet as the grave.</p><p>After a moment Lan Jue spoke, his voice strange. &#x201C;I&#x2019;m sorry. I didn&#x2019;t know you were&#x2026;&#x201D;</p><p>This time, it was Zhou Qianlin who was speechless.</p><p>Her body trembled, her lip quivered, her teeth clenched. It was as though she were afraid a curse would burst forth from her lips.</p><p>After some time her mood stabilized. She hissed coldly through gritted teeth:</p><p>&#x201C;This was my first time!&#x201D;</p><p>Lan Jue was dumbstruck. How could this be? He shook his head.<em> No&#x2026; this can&#x2019;t be true.</em> His heart sunk to the pit of his stomach.</p><p><em>First time? What did she mean the first time? It meant&#x2026; she wasn&#x2019;t Hera. </em></p><p><em>My Hera, my Jinyu. She still hasn&#x2019;t returned to me. </em>Lan Jue felt as though he&#x2019;d been run through with a sword. The pain in his heart stole his breath.</p><p>Watching Lan Jue&#x2019;s face drain of color, she too was dazed. The room sank in to a suffocating quiet.</p><p>Lan Jue&#x2019;s pained voice arose as he spoke to himself. &#x201C;Three years. Three years. Why would God play such a cruel trick on me? Why give me hope? Don&#x2019;t you understand&#x2026; the more you hope, the more crushing when it&#x2019;s gone. My Hera&#x2026; still hasn&#x2019;t returned.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;So what you&#x2019;re saying is, what you just did to me wasn&#x2019;t intentional.&#x201D; Zhou Qianlin&#x2019;s cold voice interrupted.</p><p>&#x201C;Huh?&#x201D; Her words snapped Lan Jue awake. Seeing here, this woman an exact replica of his Hera, somehow eased the suffering in his heart.</p><p>Yes! She wasn&#x2019;t Hera, but she and her&#x2026;</p><p>And, it had been her first time.</p><p>Further, the unification of the Eastern and Western Alliance leaders through this marriage.</p><p>Most important was that she knew who she was. Even if she didn&#x2019;t know, her family certainly would. In his arrogance he&#x2019;d let slip his name, sharing with her father regardless of the situation that his name was Zeus.</p><p>What to do?</p><p>Lan Jue felt his heart thumping in his chest. In all his life, he&#x2019;d never encountered such an awkward situation.</p><p>But it was done. Other than facing it, what else could he do?</p><p>&#x201C;W-well, Zhou Qianlin, you&#x2019;d been poisoned. Were suffering from it&#x2019;s effect. So, I was forced&#x2026; against my will to&#x2026;&#x201D;</p><p>Zhou Qianlin glared at him, saying not a word.</p><p>Lan Jue was incapable of alleviating the situation. He knew of only one solution for the current problem.</p><p>The dead don&#x2019;t talk.</p><p>Kill her, and the problem would be gone!</p><p>And yet, could he do it?</p><p>Zhou Qianlin uttered, &#x201C;I have an older sister&#x2026; I think her name is Zhou Jinyu. She disappeared when I was young. Where did you meet her?&#x201D;</p><p>Lan Jue stared at her. &#x201C;An older sister?&#x201D; She was Jinyu&#x2019;s younger sister, but Jinyu had told him she was an orphan!</p><p>A younger sister separated for that long?</p><p>He didn&#x2019;t know what to think.</p><p>Even if he could do it, silencing her wouldn&#x2019;t actually solve everything.</p><p>Zhou Qianlin shot him another cold glance. &#x201C;You just said I&#x2019;d be poisoned. That&#x2019;s why you did that to me?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Yes, yes!&#x201D; Lan Jue nodded emphatically.</p><p>Zhou Qianlin&#x2019;s expression changed, and she sat up abruptly. With eyes wide she glared at Lan Jue and yelled, &#x201C;Have you never heard of places called HOSPITALS on this planet? What sort of poison could a modern hospital not cure? You could have sent me to the hospital. If I&#x2019;m poisoned how does sleeping with me fix anything?</p><p>&#x201C;I&#x2026;&#x201D; Lan Jue stared at her dumbly, dropping his head after a moment. Not knowing whether to laugh or cry, he muttered, &#x201C;I thought you were someone else.&#x201D;</p><p>Zhou Qialin&#x2019;s expression was pained, possibly due to the pain in her body.</p><p>&#x201C;Put your clothes on. I don&#x2019;t want to look at your hideous self. I&#x2019;m afraid I&#x2019;ll get a stye.&#x201D; She shook her head violently for him to leave.</p><p>Lan Jue scrambled to his feet, quickly pulling on his clothes. As he did, his eyes fell upon the wedding dress crumbled atop the sofa. &#x201C;It was probably your fianc&#xE9; who poisoned you. To go so far as to poison your own new wife&#x2026; this sort of scumbag, you&#x2019;re better off not marrying him.&#x201D;</p><p>Zhou Qianlin shot him a glare. &#x201C;How do you know it was him? Before then, he had never even touched me. Scumbag? YOU&#x2019;RE the scumbag! And even if he was, at least he didn&#x2019;t break the law. You? You destroyed my wedding, and defiled my body. You tell me, what are we going to do about that?&#x201D;</p><p></p><hr><p></p>
