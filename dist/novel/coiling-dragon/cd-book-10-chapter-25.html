<p><b><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> Book 10, Baruch &#x2013; Chapter 25, Twelve Years in the Blink of an Eye</span></b></p><p>The Radiant Church. The Holy Island. The ninth floor of the Radiant Temple.</p><p>Staring outside the window, a hint of worry was on Heidens&apos; face. Previously, Linley had made an agreement with the Radiant Church, allowing the Radiant Church to relax. After all, without the assistance of his Supreme Warriors and that terrifying rat-type magical beast, Linley, by himself, wasn&#x2019;t too great a threat.</p><p>But they were only relaxed for nine years.</p><p>Because on the ninth year, the Radiant Church discovered a terrifying secret.</p><p>Linley&#x2019;s human form had reached the Saint level.</p><p>&#x201C;Heidens.&#x201D; An icy voice rang out. Osenno, his devilish purple hair fluttering behind him, appeared in the middle of the ninth floor.</p><p>Heidens didn&#x2019;t turn. Calmly, he said, &#x201C;Osenno, what is it?&#x201D;</p><p>Osenno had a hint of frustration in his voice. &#x201C;Heidens, the many experts of the Church have been cooped up in the Sacred Isle for three full years. During these three years, you&#x2019;ve ordered that we are not to go outside the Sacred Isle without authorization. Heidens&#x2026;can it be that just because of Linley, we have to live like this?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;And Heidens, you must understand, the information we got came from an agent who overheard the conversation which Linley&#x2019;s son was having with Wharton&#x2019;s son. That&#x2019;s the only information we have stating that Linley has reached the Saint level in human form. The words of children are not necessarily true.&#x201D; Osenno said unhappily.</p><p>Because of this news, that Linley had reached the Saint-level in his human form, Heidens asked Osenno and the others to not leave the Sacred Isle.</p><p>Heidens remained with his back turned towards Osenno. Calmly, he said, &#x201C;Osenno, first of all, Wharton&#x2019;s son, Cena [Xi&#x2019;ne], is a very reliable and very meticulous youth. His words should be true. And secondly&#x2026;when Linley was hidden within the O&#x2019;Brien Empire, he had already reached the ninth rank. It has been over ten years now. Given the rate of growth for Dragonblood Warriors, it is about time that Linley reaches the Saint level in human form.&#x201D;</p><p>Heidens suddenly turned and stared at Osenno.</p><p>&#x201C;You should be very clear about how powerful Linley is. Twelve years ago, he was only slightly weaker to you. Now that his human form has reached the Saint-level&#x2026;his power should be more than ten times greater than before. Even if he didn&#x2019;t gain any additional insights at all, he can defeat you. But do you believe that in twelve years, Linley hasn&#x2019;t increased his level of insights at all?&#x201D; Heidens asked Osenno.</p><p>Osenno was silent.</p><p>He knew full well how quickly Linley trained.</p><p>Twelve years without any breakthroughs? Who would believe it?</p><p>That ancestor of the Baruch clan who had only reached the &#x2018;impose&#x2019; level when he reached the Saint-level as a human-form Dragonblood Warrior was nonetheless able to rely on his terrifying post-Saint-level defense and power to fight head on against peak-stage Saint-level magical beasts.</p><p>And Linley?</p><p>In strength and battle-qi, he was not inferior to his ancestor. However, he had a very deep understanding of the Laws. He was even more terrifying to deal with than the ancestors of the Baruch clan.</p><p>&#x201C;Heidens, the Sacred Isle doesn&#x2019;t need me to defend it, does it.&#x201D; Osenno asked.</p><p>&#x201C;Osenno, if you truly want to leave the Sacred Isle&#x2026;I won&#x2019;t try to stop you.&#x201D; Heidens said calmly. &#x201C;But leaving the Sacred Isle means that you are betting that Linley won&#x2019;t find and kill you! Of course, your fleeing abilities are top notch. But I&#x2019;m not certain if you would be able to flee from Linley.&#x201D;</p><p>Osenno had the Doppelganger Technique and was very fast.</p><p>But he probably only had a fifty-fifty chance of fleeing and surviving if Linley encountered him.</p><p>&#x201C;Hmph. Fine. I&#x2019;ll wait until my Doppelganger Technique reaches the peak before I have another tussle with Linley.&#x201D; Osenno sneered coldly, and then with a flicker, disappeared from the ninth floor. But although his words were tough, clearly he had already submitted.</p><p>A hint of a bitter smile could be seen on Heidens&apos; face.</p><p>It was virtually impossible to keep tabs on someone at Linley&#x2019;s level. Right now, Linley&#x2019;s flying speed was far quicker than it had been in the past. It would take him less than half a day to cross the entire Yulan continent. This sort of speed&#x2026;if he wanted to chase after and kill someone, he could definitely make sure that his opponent didn&#x2019;t have time to call for help.</p><p>Yulan calendar, year 10022. May. An area outside Baruch City with wild flower and wild grass swaying, their beautiful dance so moving to behold. Right now, there were two luxurious carriages and a squad of elite knights who were escorting them down this wild road.</p><p>&#x201C;Your Majesty, we are at Mt. Blackraven.&#x201D; A knight said respectfully towards the second carriage.</p><p>Immediately, a husband and wife couple stepped out of the carriage, along with a youth. The couple was Wharton and Nina. Wharton was much more mature now than he had been. He was the King of the Baruch Kingdom, and his personal strength had dramatically increased as well. Wharton&#x2019;s body emanated the aura of an expert. As for Nina, she wasn&#x2019;t as unripe as she had been in the past; her body was fuller, now, and she had become even more womanly.</p><p>As for that twelve or thirteen year old child in front of them, who seemed so friendly and yet graceful? This child was the son of Wharton and Nina: Cena Baruch.</p><p>&#x201C;Wow, we are at Mt. Blackraven!&#x201D; An excited voice rang out from the carriage in front of them, and a very excited youth clambered out of the carriage.</p><p>&#x201C;Taylor [Tai&#x2019;le].&#x201D; Cena laughed as he called out.</p><p>&#x201C;Big brother.&#x201D; Taylor ran over happily. Taylor was relatively handsome, but he was far more energetic than Cena.</p><p>At this time, yet another beautiful lady stepped out of the carriage in front, as well as a pretty young girl. It was Delia and her daughter, Sasha [Sha&#x2019;sha]. Sasha looked quite similar to Taylor. The two of them were actually twins, but Sasha was born just a little while before Taylor was, and thus Taylor was forced to be the &#x2018;little brother&#x2019;.</p><p>Cena was twelve, while Sasha and Taylor were ten.</p><p>&#x201C;We&#x2019;re about to see Father soon. I haven&#x2019;t seen him in half a year.&#x201D; Taylor was extremely excited right now, and Cena&#x2019;s eyes had a hint of excitement in them as well. As the children of the Baruch clan, they all worshipped this person who supported the entire Baruch clan&#x2026;Linley.</p><p>The countless members of the Baruch Kingdom also worshipped Linley. Linley was the spiritual support for the entire Baruch Kingdom. There was no question about this.</p><p>Although twelve years had passed, Delia&#x2019;s appearance hadn&#x2019;t changed at all. In fact, she actually now had a certain aura about her. Delia&#x2019;s children had blissful smiles on their faces. Twelve years of peaceful, happy life. Delia truly was very satisfied.</p><p>She stared at the distant Baruch City.</p><p>The royal capital, Baruch City, had been expanded long ago. The normal population was over a million. Because Linley had brought the massive fortune he had taken from the Kingdom of Fenlai, the Baruch Kingdom had easily weathered the first few tough years, and now, the entire Kingdom was prospering very nicely.</p><p>Raising her head to look at Mt. Blackraven, Delia&#x2019;s heart was already by Linley&#x2019;s side.</p><p>&#x201C;Wharton, Nina, let&#x2019;s go up the mountain.&#x201D; Delia laughed. &#x201C;Taylor, Sasha, Cena, follow along.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Got it.&#x201D; Taylor said loudly.</p><p>His sister, Sasha, was very quiet. The squad of knights came to a halt at the foot of Mt. Blackraven, while Wharton, Nina, Delia, and the three children went up Mt. Blackraven together. Mt. Blackraven was as beautiful and graceful as ever.</p><p>Following the little creek, they finally saw the lake in the distance.</p><p>There were now three massive flattened boulders in the center of the lake. The central boulder was the first one which Linley had put down, and the stone house was naturally the one he had built long ago. As for the other two boulders, Linley had arranged them after his wedding, for when people came to visit for a while.</p><p>A faint blue figure was currently fishing in the middle of the lake.</p><p>&#x201C;Father!&#x201D; Taylor&#x2019;s voice rang out from far away.</p><p>That blue-robed figure turned around. It was Linley. Linley looked slightly more mature than he had in the past, and looking at him from a distance, one had the sense that he had totally become one with nature. Linley immediately stood up and laughed, &#x201C;Haha, Taylor!&#x201D;</p><p>Linley&#x2019;s standing motion gave the sensation of moving with the wind itself, but it also gave an extremely solid, stable sensation as well. These two opposite sensations, merged into one person, was simply unimaginable for those who didn&#x2019;t personally experience it.</p><p>Linley waved his hand&#x2026;</p><p>&#x201C;Bang!&#x201D; Part of the flowing water instantly came to a halt, forming a bridge of water. The other parts of the lake continued to flow normally. Taylor and Sasha, quite experienced, stepped directly onto the bridge of water and ran over.</p><p>The water bridge was solid and durable.</p><p>If one looked at it closely, one would see that on top of the water bridge were minute, tiny flows of air.</p><p>&#x201C;Taylor. Come. Hug.&#x201D; Linley happily lifted Taylor into his arms, and the nearby Sasha immediately stared at Linley with her big, innocent eyes. Linley immediately reached out and lifted his beloved daughter into his embrace as well. &#x201C;Taylor, Sasha, it&#x2019;s been half a year since you&#x2019;ve seen Father. Have you missed Father?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Yes.&#x201D; Taylor said immediately. &#x201C;Every day.&#x201D;</p><p>Linley&#x2019;s face instantly was covered with smiles. He now totally could understand how Grandpa Doehring had felt towards him, and how his father&#x2019;s superficial severity masked a deep layer of love.</p><p>&#x201C;Hey. Taylor, Sasha, Cena, you all came.&#x201D; A happy voice emanated from the skies, and a black shadow suddenly appeared in the middle of the lake. It was the magical beast Bebe, now two meters long.</p><p>Linley looked at Bebe and couldn&#x2019;t help but laugh inwardly.</p><p>Whenever Bebe was in front of these three &#x2018;juniors&#x2019; (Taylor, Sasha, and Cena), he always made his body a little bit bigger. As Bebe put it, &#x2018;if my body is too small, I won&#x2019;t have the aura of an elder&#x2019;.</p><p>&#x201C;Uncle Bebe.&#x201D; Taylor immediately broke free from Linley&#x2019;s embrace and went to hug Bebe.</p><p>When Taylor was young, Bebe often played around with Taylor.</p><p>Wharton chuckled. &#x201C;Big brother, let&#x2019;s sit down first. We can talk while eating. I brought many delicacies with me.&#x201D; As he spoke, the family sat down around a long rectangular table, and within his interspatial ring, Wharton withdrew the freshly prepared dishes.</p><p>The family began to eat.</p><p>&#x201C;Big brother, have you heard of the big battle that occurred in the O&#x2019;Brien Empire?&#x201D; Wharton asked.</p><p>With an &#x2018;Oh&#x2019; sound, Linley said, &#x201C;Are you talking about half a month ago, how Olivier challenged Haydson to another duel?&#x201D; Olivier had already returned from the Arctic Icecap, returned with the aura of utmost confidence.</p><p>Wharton sighed appreciatively. &#x201C;Right. With just a single sword blow, he killed Haydson, who was famous for his defense. How terrifying.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Haydson. Is it the Haydson who dueled with father at Mt. Tujiao?&#x201D; Taylor raised his head up high and asked. This little fellow deeply venerated Linley, and he knew the details of Linley&#x2019;s famous battles as well as anything.</p><p>Linley laughed and nodded.</p><p>The nearby Delia also sighed in approval. &#x201C;This Olivier really is formidable. Just one sword blow! Haydson&#x2019;s defensive abilities were legendary. To be killed in one blow&#x2026;&#x201D; Delia also sighed repeatedly. The nearby Cena suddenly looked at Linley and asked, &#x201C;Uncle, if you were to duel with Olivier again, can you win?&#x201D;</p><p>Linley laughed calmly.</p><p>&#x201C;Olivier&#x2019;s improvement speed was faster than I had anticipated. In just twelve years, he reached the level of being able to kill Haydson with one sword blow. Without actually competing with him, it&#x2019;s hard to say who would win and who would lose.&#x201D; Linley laughed.</p><p>&#x201C;Boss, what are you being modest for?&#x201D; Bebe said unhappily. &#x201C;Haydson&#x2019;s defense was on par with yours in the past. But now? Just by relying on your post-Saint transformation, the defensive power of your draconic scales alone is on a higher level than the combined power of your draconic scales and Pulseguard Defense of twelve years ago. And now, your Pulseguard Defense is more than ten times greater than before. In front of you, that Olivier isn&#x2019;t worth a fart. Even people on the second tier, like Osenno, don&#x2019;t dare to offend you. I think&#x2026;only the five Prime Saints are able to compete with you now.&#x201D;</p><p>Wharton also said, &#x201C;Big brother, you are the most powerful Dragonblood Warrior in the history of our clan. Why be modest?&#x201D;</p><p>Wharton and the others knew exactly how terrifying Linley had become.</p><p>After twelve years of painstaking training, Linley&#x2019;s level of achievement in understanding the Elemental Laws of the Earth and the Wind was so high as to make Wharton and the others utterly speechless.</p><p></p><hr><p></p>
