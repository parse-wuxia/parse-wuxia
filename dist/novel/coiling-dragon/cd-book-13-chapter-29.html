<p><b><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> Book 13, Gebados &#x2013; Chapter 29, Elemental Training</span></b></p><p>Of the three people in the manor, aside from that bald man, Burgess, the other two appeared rather amiable. Only, the young man in the middle was rather eye-catching. He had a head of long black hair, but his eyebrows were crimson red.</p><p>&#x201C;Third Brother, those two you want to meet are here.&#x201D; The bald man said as he walked in. That man with the crimson eyebrows looked towards Linley and Bebe. His gaze paused momentarily on Bebe, and then he said with a laugh, &#x201C;The two of you, take a seat first.&#x201D;</p><p>As he spoke, he pointed at the nearby seats in front of him.</p><p>&#x201C;Thank you, milord.&#x201D; Linley and Bebe both said courteously, and then they sat down on the chairs in front of the man with the crimson eyebrows.</p><p>&#x201C;Big Brother, Second Brother, you two can go about your business. I&#x2019;ll have a private chat with these two young fellows.&#x201D; The man with the crimson eyebrows said.</p><p>The bald man and the other middle-aged man clearly were very obedient towards their third brother. They both nodded then departed. The man with the crimson eyebrows looked towards Linley and Bebe. Laughing, he said, &#x201C;You can address me as Mr. Leylin. If you have come to my residence because there&#x2019;s something the two of you need from me, go ahead and tell me.&#x201D;</p><p>Mr. Leylin?</p><p>Linley and Bebe were both rather surprised. &#x201C;Hey, doesn&#x2019;t this Lord of Mount Copper Gong normally not divulge his name to people?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Mr. Leylin?&#x201D; Bebe called out in surprise.</p><p>&#x201C;What?&#x201D; Leylin looked at Bebe, puzzled.</p><p>&#x201C;My, my Boss is named Linley.&#x201D; Bebe was quite amazed.</p><p>&#x201C;Linley?&#x201D; Mr. Leylin was amazed for a moment as well before recovering.</p><p>Prior to this, Linley hadn&#x2019;t noticed this point himself. But now, he realized. &#x2018;Linley&#x2019; and &#x2018;Leylin&#x2019;, weren&#x2019;t they just the same thing, except swapped around?</p><p>&#x201C;You really are named Linley?&#x201D; This Lord &#x2018;Leylin&#x2019; was very surprised. Linley nodded and laughed, &#x201C;Yes, Mr. Leylin. My full name is Linley Baruch.&#x201D;</p><p>This Mr. Leylin calmed down as well, laughing loudly, &#x201C;Haha&#x2026;what a coincidence. I&#x2019;m the opposite of you. Leylin is my clan name. My full name is Zacharias [Jia&#x2019;ke&#x2019;li&#x2019;ya&#x2019;si] Leylin. It seems we really do have a bit in common.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Indeed.&#x201D; Linley felt that this was quite the coincidence as well.</p><p>After this discovery, Linley was no longer reticent in front of this Lord Leylin.</p><p>&#x201C;Mr. Leylin, I have come due to an issue regarding training.&#x201D; Linley said.</p><p>&#x201C;Virtually everyone who comes looking for me does so because of training issues.&#x201D; Leylin pursed his lips and laughed. &#x201C;Only, let me give you advance warning. All I can do is give you some guidance. In addition, I am only skilled in the Elemental Laws of Fire and the Elemental Laws of Earth. I would most likely only be able to say a few words regarding the other Elemental Laws.&#x201D;</p><p>Linley laughed.</p><p>The Laws of the Earth?</p><p>Actually, just from looking at this manor, Linley knew that this Lord of Mount Copper Gong definitely trained in the Laws of the Earth.</p><p>&#x201C;Speak.&#x201D; Leylin laughed.</p><p>Linley explained his frustrations and concerns regarding his bottleneck. &#x201C;Mr. Leylin, I am currently training in the &#x2018;Throbbing Pulse of the World&#x2019; of the Laws of the Earth. Only, I have already reached the level of Two Fused Waves of the Throbbing Pulse of the World, but no matter what I try, I am unable to reach the final step of fusing everything into one.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;You train in the &#x2018;Throbbing Pulse of the World&#x2019;?&#x201D; The Lord of Mount Copper Gong, Leylin, raised his eyebrows. &#x201C;It seems your talent is quite excellent.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;However, if you have reached a bottleneck, there&#x2019;s nothing I can do to help you break through.&#x201D; Leylin said with a laugh.</p><p>Linley couldn&#x2019;t help but feel astonished. Didn&#x2019;t this Lord of Mount Copper Gong help two experts break through and become Deities through his guidance?</p><p>&#x201C;You aren&#x2019;t able to help?&#x201D; Bebe said. &#x201C;Didn&#x2019;t you help others though?&#x201D;</p><p>Leylin laughed, &#x201C;Rumors grow more and more ridiculous with each telling. Nobody can help someone break through a bottleneck. At most, I can just give you one or two pointers.&#x201D; Linley&#x2019;s eyes couldn&#x2019;t help but light up. If Leylin was willing to give him some pointers and allow him to gain some insights, that would be enough.</p><p>&#x201C;Linley, you want to train in the &#x2018;Throbbing Pulse of the World&#x2019;. For now, let&#x2019;s stop discussing that. Instead, let&#x2019;s talk about the six types of profound mysteries inherent to the Laws of the Earth.&#x201D; Leylin said with a calm laugh.</p><p>&#x201C;Six types of profound mysteries?&#x201D; Linley was somewhat surprised.</p><p>From Beirut, Linley had heard the hypothetical number of profound mysteries within an Elemental Law as being nine.</p><p>&#x201C;Right. The Laws of the Earth contain in total six different profound mysteries.&#x201D; Leylin laughed. &#x201C;I&#x2019;m not sure about the other Laws, but for the earth, fire, water, and wind Laws, these four Elemental Laws, the Laws of the Earth, Fire, and Water all contain six profound mysteries each, while the Elemental Laws of the Wind have a bit more, containing nine.&#x201D;</p><p>Leylin spoke leisurely but with complete certainty, causing others to unconsciously believe him.</p><p>Linley nodded slightly.</p><p>&#x201C;The Laws of the Earth contain six profound mysteries. The most basic is the profound mystery of the &#x2018;Essence of the Earth&#x2019;.&#x201D; Leylin said.</p><p>&#x201C;The Profound Mysteries of the &#x2018;Essence of the Earth&#x2019;?&#x201D; Linley frowned.</p><p>Elemental essence was present everywhere. It should be very common. The Laws were Elemental Laws. So how could one of the profound mysteries be the profound mysteries of the &#x2018;Essence of the Earth&#x2019;?</p><p>&#x201C;Linley.&#x201D; Leylin spoke. Whenever he spoke Linley&#x2019;s name, he couldn&#x2019;t help but laugh. &#x201C;You should be aware that ordinary magic spells include the &#x2018;Earth Puppet&#x2019;, &#x2018;World Protector&#x2019;, and &#x2018;Sacred Earthguard Armor&#x2019; type spells, right?&#x201D;</p><p>Linley nodded.</p><p>Previously, when Linley was young, in the air above Wushan Township, he had watched those two Saints do battle. That Grand Magus Saint had utilized the forbidden-level spell, &#x2018;World Protector&#x2019;.</p><p>&#x201C;Regardless of whether it is the &#x2018;World Protector&#x2019; or the &#x2018;Sacred Earthguard Armor&#x2019;, they all are considered a very basic way of using the Profound Mysteries of the Essence of the Earth.&#x201D;</p><p>Leylin explained slowly, &#x201C;The Essence of the Earth can transform into countless shapes. You can use it to create a human figure, a magical beast figure, or even a set of armor. The &#x2018;Essence of the Earth&#x2019;, in the late stages of mastery, represents a deep level of proficiency in utilizing elemental essences. For example&#x2026;my manor!&#x201D;</p><p>Leylin pointed at his manor. &#x201C;Linley, look at this manor. In terms of toughness, it is comparable to adamantine. In addition, it will exist in perpetuity! Tell me, how did I accomplish this?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;This?&#x201D; Linley was very puzzled about this to begin with.</p><p>But now, Linley somewhat understood that this manor in front of him was most likely formed after reaching the level of complete mastery in the &#x2018;Essence of the Earth&#x2019;.</p><p>&#x201C;Linley, experts of the Laws of the Earth should have the most powerful defenses.&#x201D; Leylin&#x2019;s eyes, beneath those crimson eyebrows, were shining. &#x201C;Amongst them, the most powerful physical defenses rely on the &#x2018;Essence of the Earth&#x2019;, while the most powerful spiritual defenses rely on the &#x2018;Throbbing Pulse of the World&#x2019;.&#x201D;</p><p>Linley nodded in agreement.</p><p>He himself used spiritual energy to form a spiritual &#x2018;Pulseguard Defense&#x2019;.</p><p>&#x201C;The Laws of the Earth have six profound mysteries. If you want to master any of them, your best option is to start with the basics. Finish mastering the &#x2018;Essence of the Earth&#x2019;. It is the foundation!&#x201D;</p><p>Leylin advised, &#x201C;The Profound Mysteries of the Essence of the Earth is the best way one can gain a deeper understanding into the elemental essences. Once your understanding of the elemental essences reaches a certain level of depth, then it will become much easier for you to gain insights into the other profound mysteries of the Laws.&#x201D;</p><p>Linley somewhat understood now.</p><p>&#x201C;The final, Omega Wave of the Throbbing Pulse of the World is extremely hard to achieve. I&#x2019;m not able to provide any direct advice, but I imagine that if you can focus and meditate on the Profound Mysteries of the Essence of the Earth, perhaps it will be of benefit to you in breaking through with regards to the Throbbing Pulse of the World.&#x201D; Leylin laughed.</p><p>&#x201C;Thank you, Mr. Leylin.&#x201D; Linley&#x2019;s heart was filled with gratitude.</p><p>&#x201C;Everything relies on you yourself.&#x201D; Leylin laughed. &#x201C;Then, how about this. Linley, take a close look.&#x201D;</p><p>Leylin looked into the air. Suddenly, in the air above, earth elemental essence began to gather.</p><p>Linley raised his head to watch as well.</p><p>An explosive surge of earth elemental essence was rapidly condensing, and even began to emit a faint rumbling sound. An enormous earthen cloud appeared in the sky above Mount Copper Gong, and then this cloud of earth transformed into an earth-colored python that was a hundred meters long.</p><p>&#x201C;Hissssss.&#x201D; The python seemed to be real, occasionally revealing its fangs.</p><p>This enormous python which had appeared in mid-air truly did cause Linley to feel shock in his heart.</p><p>&#x201C;Is this the result of mastery in the Essence of the Earth?&#x201D; Linley secretly wondered.</p><p>&#x201C;Now, take a close look.&#x201D; Leylin said in a low shout.</p><p>Linley immediately focused his attention while at the same time, spreading out his divine sense to carefully study every single movement of this enormous python. This hundred-meter long coiling python suddenly whipped out its tail in a fury, its thick, long serpentine tail lashing out like the crack of a whip.</p><p>&#x201C;Rumble...&#x201D;</p><p>The whipping tail attack of the python actually created spatial ripples that were visible to the naked eye.</p><p>The spatial ripples were simply too great. Every single ripple caused space to crack. Instantly&#x2026;in the air above Mount Copper Gong, the rippled, cracked space began to reveal itself, appearing then disappearing. Only, as the spatial ripples continued to spread outwards, the strength naturally began to decrease.</p><p>Despite that, however, the nearby trees that were impacted by these spatial ripples were instantly transformed into dust.</p><p>&#x201C;This? Is this the Throbbing Pulse of the World?&#x201D; Linley was astonished.</p><p>&#x201C;This is the &#x2018;Throbbing Pulse of the World&#x2019; at mastery.&#x201D; Leylin laughed as he looked at Linley.</p><p>&#x201C;The &#x2018;Throbbing Pulse of the World&#x2019; can be utilized through creatures formed from elemental essence?&#x201D; Linley was very surprised.</p><p>&#x201C;Why not?&#x201D; Leylin laughed calmly as he spoke. &#x201C;And this is just the &#x2018;Throbbing Pulse of the World&#x2019; and the &#x2018;Essence of the Earth&#x2019; used separately. If I were to fuse the two of them and then use them&#x2026;most likely this Mount Copper Gong would no longer exist.&#x201D;</p><p>Linley&#x2019;s heart was filled with amazement.</p><p>He knew that the profound mysteries of the Elemental Laws could fuse with each other.</p><p>&#x201C;So powerful.&#x201D; The nearby Bebe let out a sigh of praise as well, then he looked at Leylin in confusion. &#x201C;Mr. Leylin, just now, you said that of the earth, fire, water, and wind Elemental Laws, only the Elemental Laws of the Wind have nine profound mysteries. The other three only have six profound mysteries. Then doesn&#x2019;t that mean&#x2026;that it will be very hard to train in the Elemental Laws of the Wind?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;No.&#x201D;</p><p>Leylin let out a sigh. &#x201C;The numbers might be different, but the total difficulty level is roughly the same. For example, the &#x2018;Throbbing Pulse of the World&#x2019; and the &#x2018;Gravitational Field&#x2019; profound mysteries of the Laws of the Earth are all extremely hard to learn. In order to reach mastery in either of the two, one must spend tremendous effort, have some good luck, and also occasional flashes of insight.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Linley, first train in the &#x2018;Essence of the Earth&#x2019;. Perhaps it will bring you some unexpected surprises.&#x201D; Leylin laughed.</p><p>Linley nodded slightly.</p><p>Linley knew that the &#x2018;Essence of the Earth&#x2019; was fairly easy to pick up. After all, in the past, most of his magic was based off of controlling elemental essences.</p><p>&#x201C;Mr. Leylin, might I ask if in the future, I can come again to ask for your aid?&#x201D; Linley asked.</p><p>&#x201C;Of course you can. So long as I remain here at Mount Copper Gong, you can come find me.&#x201D; Leylin said.</p><p>Linley could hear Leylin&#x2019;s unspoken meaning. &#x201C;Mr. Leylin, can it be that you are going to leave?&#x201D;</p><p>Leylin nodded and sighed. &#x201C;Indeed. In the not too distant future, I will indeed leave this place.&#x201D; After speaking, Leylin seemed to have thought of something. Letting out a sigh, he no longer spoke.</p><p>And then, Linley and Bebe thus settled down within Mount Copper Gong while sending a message via divine sense to the people in Dragonblood Castle. Normally, they quietly trained here at Mount Copper Gong. While training in the Profound Mysteries of the Essence of the Earth, Linley slowly began to discover the benefits to training in the Essence of the Earth.</p><p>Within a quiet courtyard.</p><p>Sadista once more spread out his divine sense to search for Linley. He couldn&#x2019;t help but frown, his eyes containing a hint of anger. &#x201C;This Linley is still together with that Godeater Rat. Hmph. And this mountain actually has two other Gods?&#x201D;</p><p>Given Sadista&#x2019;s power, he could easily discover those two Gods.</p><p>&#x201C;Just Gods.&#x201D; Sadista didn&#x2019;t care about them at all. &#x201C;But it seems we still need to wait for the right chance.&#x201D;</p><p>Sadista was extremely patient. Without complete certainty, he wouldn&#x2019;t send Anras to attack. After all, his number one priority was still the treasures within the Necropolis of the Gods.</p><p>But it was very strange&#x2026;</p><p>That Lord of Mount Copper Gong, &#x2018;Leylin&#x2019;, lived on the mountain with his two brothers. However, Sadista was only able to discover those two Gods. He didn&#x2019;t discover the presence of that third person, &#x2018;Leylin&#x2019;.</p><p></p><hr><p></p>
