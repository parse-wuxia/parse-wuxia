<p><b><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> Book 13, Gebados &#x2013; Chapter 15, Unwilling to Admit Defeat</span></b></p><p>The exploding sound, along with Dylin&#x2019;s roar, shook Dragonblood Castle.</p><p>&#x201C;What&#x2019;s going on?&#x201D; The War God, High Priest, Cesar, Delia, Wharton, Gates, and the others all hastened over. They saw Dylin, Ojwin, and Hanbritt facing off. Instantly, they all moved carefully to stand near Linley.</p><p>Delia warmly gripped Linley&#x2019;s hand, saying in a soft voice, &#x201C;Linley, that Ojwin came again?&#x201D; Delia was a little worried.</p><p>Last time, when Ojwin had attacked, Linley had ordered Delia, Wharton, and the others to hide in the pocket dimension. Thus, Delia and the others had never seen Ojwin. But, as Delia viewed it, the attacking Gods had to be from Ojwin&#x2019;s side.</p><p>&#x201C;It is him. He brought a helper as well. However, Lord Dylin and Lord Tarosse are more than enough to deal with them.&#x201D; Linley comforted softly.</p><p>Delia nodded.</p><p>The two raised their heads to watch.</p><p>&#x201C;Haha&#x2026;&#x201D; Tarosse flew over, laughing loudly. &#x201C;Ojwin, I didn&#x2019;t expect you&#x2019;d have the courage to come yet again. It seems you didn&#x2019;t take the words I said to you last time in the imperial capital to heart.&#x201D;</p><p>That green whip appeared in Tarosse&#x2019;s hands.</p><p>&#x201C;Crackle crackle.&#x201D; That whip emanated a freezing aura.</p><p>Ojwin&#x2019;s two divine clones, along with Hanbritt, both felt terror in their hearts.</p><p>&#x201C;Ojwin!!!&#x201D; Hanbritt roared furiously through his divine sense. Hanbritt was truly angered now. This situation had developed in a way that was completely different from Ojwin&#x2019;s predictions.</p><p>Ojwin also had a bad feeling.</p><p>The two of them were just barely able to resist Dylin&#x2019;s devouring power. Only by joining forces, along with Ojwin using both his divine clones, were the two able to just barely resist. They were completely unable to move right now. If this situation continued&#x2026;if Tarosse were to attack, the two of them would be sitting targets!</p><p>&#x201C;Haha, eat a few hundred whip strikes first.&#x201D; Tarosse laughed loudly as he began to whirl his whip.</p><p>A few hundred whips?</p><p>The faces of Ojwin and Hanbritt, who were working hard to resist the devouring power, changed dramatically. How could they possibly be able to take the attack of this God head on?</p><p>&#x201C;Whooosh.&#x201D;</p><p>The long green whip danced out like a massive serpent, transforming into brilliant green shadows. The temperature of the nearby area lowered to the freezing point, and a layer of frost appeared on the ground. The long green whip danced like a serpent&#x2019;s tail, striking viciously towards Ojwin and Hanbritt.</p><p>&#x201C;Retreat!&#x201D;</p><p>Ojwin and Hanbritt simultaneously gritted their teeth, exploding forth the energy within their bodies, risking injury to themselves as they forcibly broke through from the area of Dylin&#x2019;s devouring force.</p><p>&#x201C;Boom!&#x201D; An explosion occurred in mid-air, and a sudden tempest arose out of nowhere. Even some of the decorative plants and trees of Dragonblood Castle were destroyed. Ojwin&#x2019;s two divine clones, along with Hanbritt, stood there in the air above Dragonblood Castle, their faces ashen.</p><p>Dylin let out a soft curse. &#x201C;Hrmph. If it wasn&#x2019;t for the fact that my divine power isn&#x2019;t pure and powerful enough yet, how could the two of you have escaped?&#x201D;</p><p>In the air above Dragonblood Castle. Ojwin&#x2019;s two clones and Hanbritt hovered in mid-air.</p><p>&#x201C;The two of you better f*ck off and stay the hell away. Otherwise, I won&#x2019;t show any mercy this time.&#x201D; Tarosse continued to chortle as he raised his head to stare at those two sorry figures in mid-air.</p><p>Hanbritt looked back at Ojwin. He transmitted with his divine sense, &#x201C;Ojwin, that Dylin, is the &#x2018;weakling&#x2019; you spoke of? Hmph. I think we better go.&#x201D; Hanbritt, having accepted a divine artifact from Ojwin, didn&#x2019;t feel comfortable just leaving by himself.</p><p>Ojwin stared coldly down below, his heart filled with raging fury.</p><p>As he stared down at Olivier, who stood next to Linley, Ojwin&#x2019;s rage caused his entire body to shake. With his divine sense, he said, &#x201C;Hanbritt, this was my mistake. I didn&#x2019;t clearly investigate the opponent&#x2019;s strength. But&#x2026;I absolutely must kill this Olivier. If I don&#x2019;t, even in death, I won&#x2019;t be satisfied.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Have you gone mad?&#x201D; Hanbritt stared towards Ojwin rather unhappily.</p><p>Ojwin&#x2019;s gaze was still fixed towards the ground below. He replied through his divine sense, &#x201C;Hanbritt, don&#x2019;t worry&#x2026;that Dylin&#x2019;s devouring force can only be aimed in one direction. How about this. The two of us will simultaneously attack from different directions. This time, I&#x2019;ll tie up Dylin and Tarosse, while you go kill Olivier. Hanbritt, I&#x2019;m begging you.&#x201D;</p><p>After speaking, Ojwin looked seriously at Hanbritt.</p><p>Hanbritt hesitated a moment, and then let out a sigh.</p><p>&#x201C;Fine. I&#x2019;ll agree.&#x201D; Hanbritt continued, &#x201C;But if I encounter any danger, I will be the first to flee. Don&#x2019;t blame me then.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Of course I won&#x2019;t blame you.&#x201D; Ojwin looked gratefully at Hanbritt. &#x201C;Thank you.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Get ready.&#x201D; Hanbritt said.</p><p>Ojwin&#x2019;s divine light clone and divine fire clone simultaneously demonstrated their might. A brilliant holy light swept down, shooting towards Linley&#x2019;s general area. This sort of holy light was actually a purifying light. Generally speaking, even any Saints hit by this light would be injured.</p><p>This was the same technique which Ojwin had used to destroy the imperial palace of the Baruch Empire.</p><p>This attack had caused virtually all the people in the palace to die, leaving behind only Ankh and Cena as the lucky survivors, with Cena being badly wounded.</p><p>&#x201C;Not good.&#x201D; Seeing this, Linley didn&#x2019;t hesitate at all. He immediately smashed his fists into the ground, and a strange energy force suddenly spread appeared in the air above the dozens of people present. It was like a translucent barrier, immediately covering Linley, Wharton, and the others in its protective embrace.</p><p>Forbidden-level earth-style magic &#x2013; Pulsating Guard!</p><p>The Pulsating Guard spell was a large-scale protective magic spell. It generally could be used to protect an entire city. For example, if the opponent used &#x2018;Heavenly Meteor&#x2019;s Descent&#x2019; to create countless boulders to smash down towards a city, one could use the &#x2018;Pulsating Guard&#x2019; to protect against it.</p><p>Upon reaching the Deity-level, forbidden-level magic spells could be cast in an instant.</p><p>And in terms of power, these spells were now much more powerful than the ones Saints could cast. Linley&#x2019;s &#x2018;Pulsating Guard&#x2019; defense was controlled within just a few dozen meters. The holy light was thus successfully defended against by the &#x2018;Pulsating Guard&#x2019;.</p><p>&#x201C;Swoosh!&#x201D; &#x201C;Swoosh!&#x201D; One white, one red. Two rays of light streaked downwards. Ojwin had never planned on using that holy light to kill anyone; that was just something he was using to create chaos. His two divine clones shot down at what seemed like the speed of light&#x2026;</p><p>And at the same time, Hanbritt moved in an angular way, charging towards Linley&#x2019;s direction.</p><p>&#x201C;I&#x2019;ll go block him! Tarosse, I&#x2019;ll let you handle Ojwin&#x2019;s two divine clones. Don&#x2019;t let him get through.&#x201D; Dylin immediately used his divine sense to speak to Tarosse.</p><p>&#x201C;No worries.&#x201D; Tarosse continued to laugh gaily.</p><p>Dylin raised his speed to the limit, transforming into a blur as he went to stop Hanbritt. At the same time, a ray of red light, carrying a destructive aura, wildly attacked Dylin, and the lance Ojwin was wielding also shot out like a devouring fire dragon.</p><p>Dylin instantly was greatly shocked. &#x201C;Has Ojwin gone crazy?&#x201D;</p><p>Dylin could tell that this divine fire clone of Ojwin&#x2019;s was using his divine power wildly, without any care at all. It must be understood&#x2026;a Deity&#x2019;s divine power accumulated very slowly. Generally speaking, in battle, they wouldn&#x2019;t be willing to so wildly utilize it like this. If they did so, they wouldn&#x2019;t be able to maintain the expenditure for long before their divine power was all used up, at which point, the enemy would be able to easily devastate them.</p><p>&#x201C;Swish!&#x201D; Dylin&#x2019;s third eye instantly shot out an invisible ripple.</p><p>Ojwin&#x2019;s divine fire clone, in terms of power, was inferior to his divine light clone. Upon being struck by that invisible ripple, Ojwin&#x2019;s divine fire clone immediately came to a halt. Dylin then immediately formed his two hands into claws. Those divine artifact gloves atop his hands, he clawed straight towards Ojwin&#x2019;s head.</p><p>&#x201C;Clang!&#x201D;</p><p>Dylin and the divine fire clone collided viciously.</p><p>Dylin was tied up by the divine fire clone, and so that Hanbritt naturally charged towards Olivier. Olivier didn&#x2019;t have any chance to flee. His speed was far inferior to Hanbritt&#x2019;s.</p><p>&#x201C;Haha&#x2026;&#x201D; Hanbritt&#x2019;s eyes had a hint of excitement flash through them as he flew down.</p><p>&#x201C;Too early to be so happy.&#x201D; A lazy voice rang out in Hanbritt&#x2019;s mind, and suddenly, a black-robed man appeared in front of Hanbritt. This black-robed man was wielding a long, thin, blood-red saber, and directly chopped towards him.</p><p>Wherever that long saber passed by, space disintegrated.</p><p>&#x201C;Bang!&#x201D; Hanbritt&#x2019;s right hand, flashing with blue light, slammed against the edge of that saber. Instantly, he was knocked flying away. Hanbritt&#x2019;s hand was also covered by a divine artifact. He, too, used his hands as his weapons.</p><p>Hanbritt was greatly shocked. &#x201C;This Tarosse also has a Destruction-style divine clone!&#x201D;</p><p>Currently, the green-robed Tarosse wielding the whip was still busy with Ojwin. However, this Tarosse with the long, narrow blade was able to force Hanbritt to retreat in one blow.</p><p>&#x201C;Ojwin, let&#x2019;s go, quick!&#x201D; Hanbritt let out a nervous divine sense message to Ojwin, and then immediately fled towards the northern skies, no longer doing battle.</p><p>&#x201C;Aaaaah!&#x201D;</p><p>Ojwin&#x2019;s divine light clone and divine fire clone both had fierce looks on their faces. They both let out howls of anger and unwillingness to accept this result. They truly weren&#x2019;t willing to admit defeat. Ojwin had his divine fire clone go deal with Dylin, and had already accepted that he might lose one of his divine clones.</p><p>Even at the price of losing one of his divine clones, he still wanted to kill Olivier! This was because&#x2026;he wished to avenge his son&#x2019;s death!</p><p>But this Tarosse had divine clones as well. And in terms of power&#x2026;the situation was different from Ojwin&#x2019;s. The divine Destruction clone which Tarosse had hidden, in terms of power, was actually not one whit inferior to Tarosse&#x2019;s divine water clone.</p><p>Letting out a furious howl of unwillingness, Ojwin&#x2019;s two divine clones transformed into two rays of red and white light, simultaneously fleeing into the northern horizons.</p><p>&#x201C;It&#x2019;s finally over.&#x201D; The vast majority of people in Dragonblood Castle let out sighs of relief.</p><p>The guards and maids, who had been hiding, were terrified by this battle. Battles on this level&#x2026;ordinary people like themselves could be killed just as collateral damage, and even their souls would be destroyed.</p><p>&#x201C;Tarosse, why do you keep hiding your real power? At a time like this, you didn&#x2019;t at least force one of them to stay behind?&#x201D; Dylin said somewhat unhappily. &#x201C;Don&#x2019;t tell me that you don&#x2019;t have that ability. You definitely have more abilities that I am unaware of!&#x201D;</p><p>Dylin and Tarosse had lived together on the Yulan continent ten thousand years ago. They were once good friends.</p><p>Dylin&#x2019;s innate abilities. Tarosse&#x2019;s innate abilities. They each knew about the other&#x2019;s.</p><p>&#x201C;Haha, don&#x2019;t blame me.&#x201D; Tarosse&#x2019;s two divine clones combined into one again, and he laughed as he looked at Dylin. &#x201C;Dylin, why did you only use your &#x2018;Devour&#x2019; power a single time? If you used &#x2018;Devour&#x2019; a second time, you probably would have devoured Ojwin&#x2019;s divine fire clone.&#x201D;</p><p>Dylin glanced at Tarosse. &#x201C;Use it again? Easy for you to say. If I used it again, my divine power would be completely exhausted! What a motherf*cking shame. Just then, when I used it the first time, I didn&#x2019;t succeed. I was originally hoping to kill both of them at the same time just then.&#x201D;</p><p>This innate ability was simply too terrifying and monstrous.</p><p>At the same time, though, the amount of energy it consumed was simply astonishing. The number of times it could be used didn&#x2019;t have too much of a correlation to how powerful one was.</p><p>For even the weak, it could be used two or three times. Only, each time, the power would be fairly weak as well. For the strong, it still could only be used two or three times, but each time, the power would be astonishing.</p><p>&#x201C;You are always so greedy. If it weren&#x2019;t for the fact that five thousand years ago, you got greedy and used your Devour ability to try and get some Demigod-level divine sparks for your children&#x2026;you wouldn&#x2019;t have angered Lord Beirut, resulting in him throwing you into the Planar Prison.&#x201D; Tarosse said with a laugh.</p><p>Dylin snorted coldly, no longer saying anything else.</p><p>He naturally felt uncomfortable when thinking back to five thousand years ago.</p><p>As Dylin and Tarosse chatted, they walked towards Linley and the others. Linley, the War God, and the others, from this battle, had an even greater appreciation for the difference in power between them and Gods. Given their current level of power, if they were to face any Gods by themselves, they would be doomed.</p><p>&#x201C;Lord Tarosse, Lord Dylin, thank you!&#x201D; Olivier walked forward and said solemnly.</p><p>&#x201C;It&#x2019;s fine. But you little rascal, in the future, stop causing so many problems.&#x201D; Tarosse said with a calm laugh.</p><p></p><hr><p></p>
