<p><b><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> Book 11, Necropolis of the Gods &#x2013; Chapter 33, Life and Death </span></b></p><p>From time to time, Desri would use his spiritual energy to attack.</p><p>This battle was simply too intense!</p><p>&#x201C;Slash&#x2026;&#x201D;</p><p>Space itself seemed to be sliced through, as the blood-red long blade transformed into a bloody saber-flash, piercing through the space between the red Abyssal Blade Demon and Linley, arriving in front of Linley in an instant.</p><p>With the adamantine heavy sword in one hand, and Bloodviolet in the other, the Dragonblood Warrior, Linley, let out an angry snort, and the adamantine heavy sword in his hand struck out gracefully, seemingly slow but actually fast, clanging against that blood-red long blade. &#x2018;Clang&#x2019;. Linley felt as though a mountain had smashed against him.</p><p>&#x201C;Slash!&#x201D; He couldn&#x2019;t suppress the blood that bubbled up, and blood burst forth from his lips.</p><p>Even the draconic scales on the right hand wielding the adamantine heavy sword had been shattered from the vibration, but moments later, Linley&#x2019;s injury healed at an astonishing rate. Linley himself didn&#x2019;t pay attention to a minor wound like this.</p><p>&#x201C;Hrm?&#x201D; Linley was staring at the blood-red Abyssal Blade Demon, waiting to see what the result would be.</p><p>The attack he had used just now was the one he had used to kill the Flame Tyrant, the most powerful blow of the Profound Truths of the Earth.</p><p>The body of the red Abyssal Blade Demon quivered like a steel wire, and with that quiver, a hint of golden blood appeared at the corner of its mouth.</p><p>&#x201C;You really are powerful.&#x201D; The red Abyssal Blade Demon stared coldly at Linley.</p><p>Linley was secretly shocked. &#x201C;No wonder he is the leader of the Abyssal Blade Demons. His body is far more powerful than the bodies of those ordinary Abyssal Blade Demons. Despite taking my full strength blow, his body wasn&#x2019;t shattered to pieces. The bodies of metal creatures are indeed far tougher than the bodies of humans.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Growl&#x2026;.&#x201D; The red Abyssal Blade Demon&#x2019;s eyes were filled with flames, and it tightened its two-handed grip on its blood-red long blade.</p><p>Within the tunnel, both suddenly flew towards the other at high speed.</p><p>&#x201C;No matter what, I have to kill him this time.&#x201D; Linley had made up his mind.</p><p>The wind suddenly emitted an ear-piercing, desolate howl. Linley and the red Abyssal Blade Demon once more clashed, and this time, Linley used Bloodviolet as his primary attack. In the blink of an eye, ten million devilish violet sword flashes appeared, arcing through the air like the countless tendrils of the Queen Mother.</p><p>Space itself suddenly froze, and the red Abyssal Blade Demon also felt that its own flying speed had just dropped dramatically.</p><p>&#x201C;Hrmph.&#x201D; A hint of bloodlust appeared in Linley&#x2019;s eyes.</p><p>He immediately activated the baleful aura within Bloodviolet with his now extremely pure spiritual energy. This was the first time Linley had utilized the baleful aura of Bloodviolet after reaching the Grand Magus Saint level, and this time, the baleful aura was more explosive and fiercer than ever before! A blood red air, almost physical in substance, suddenly attacked the red Abyssal Blade Demon.</p><p>&#x201C;Ah!&#x201D;</p><p>The red Abyssal Blade Demon suddenly had the feeling as though he were facing one of the most powerful fiends of the distant Abyss, and the terror that he felt sprang from his very soul, causing his originally mighty blade blow to hesitate slightly.</p><p>&#x201C;Wait, not right.&#x201D; Unfortunately, the baleful aura was just a remnant of its owner which had been left in Bloodviolet. Bloodviolet&#x2019;s original owner didn&#x2019;t himself appear. The red Abyssal Blade Demon quickly recovered, but by the time he did, he saw a pair of bloodthirsty eyes and a single flash of violet sword light.</p><p>&#x201C;Die!&#x201D;</p><p>Those ten million sword flashes had already combined into a single violet sword flash. The Abyssal Blade Demon, earlier affected by the baleful aura, had raised his blade to block, but the sword flash had already arrived before his eyes.</p><p>&#x201C;Slash!&#x201D;</p><p>The sword light flashed through the neck of the red Abyssal Blade Demon, and as it did&#x2026;a metallic head was sent flying away, its eyes filled with awe and disbelief. And then, the lifeless corpse of the red Abyssal Blade Demon fell to the ground.</p><p>No matter how powerful the Abyssal Blade Demon was, it wasn&#x2019;t a Deity, and it didn&#x2019;t possess a Pearl of Life. With its head gone, it died within seconds.</p><p>The attacks of the surrounding Abyssal Blade Demons suddenly came to a halt.</p><p>All of the Abyssal Blade Demons stared in disbelief at the scene. Fain, Desri, Olivier, and the others, who had been in dire straits from the sudden attack of the Abyssal Blade Demons, also felt astonished. They, too, had discovered&#x2026;that Linley had killed that red Abyssal Blade Demon.</p><p>&#x201C;Quick, flee.&#x201D; Linley&#x2019;s voice rang out in the minds of everyone.</p><p>Fain, Desri, and the others immediately recovered and hurriedly fled through the tunnels.</p><p>Up in the air above, countless Abyssal Blade Demons flew about, while in the middle of that horde was two small, skinny red Abyssal Blade Demons. The two leaders had already received the news from their subordinates.</p><p>&#x201C;Schuler [Shu&#x2019;lei] actually died.&#x201D; The red Abyssal Blade Demon on the left said in disbelief.</p><p>&#x201C;It was the Draconian.&#x201D; A cold light flashed through the eyes of the red Abyssal Blade Demon on the right. &#x201C;Earlier in the valley, the Draconian already made a big impression on me. His body should have a Pearl of Life in it. He was heavily injured by our children several times, but in an instant, he recovered.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;The main problem is that they are underground. That makes things troublesome.&#x201D; The left Abyssal Blade Demon shook his head.</p><p>&#x201C;Underground, there is no line of sight at all, and the spiritual energy of our children can only stretch for a few meters. In a fierce battle such as this, that sort of radius is useless.&#x201D; The right Abyssal Blade Demon said. &#x201C;In addition, there&#x2019;s only so much space in the tunnels. At mostly, only ten or so of our children can engage in battle against them at once.&#x201D;</p><p>Although an enormous number of Abyssal Blade Demons had also gone underground, their line of sight was obstructed, and in addition, Linley&#x2019;s side was moving at high speed. There were only so many Abyssal Blade Demons that could attack them at once.</p><p>&#x201C;Let the children of one tribe entangle them, while we constantly keep an eye on their movements.&#x201D; The right Abyssal Blade Demon said coldly. &#x201C;Whether it is to find a divine spark or to return to the tenth floor, they have to eventually leave the underground area. As soon as they do&#x2026;&#x201D;</p><p>The eyes of the left Abyssal Blade Demon also flashed with a cold look.</p><p>&#x201C;Quick, quick.&#x201D; Linley&#x2019;s group of experts were frantic.</p><p>In the tunnels, every so often, a nearby wall would suddenly be pierced through, with a large amount of Abyssal Blade Demons pouring through afterwards.</p><p>&#x201C;Fortunately we are underground. If we were above ground&#x2026;&#x201D;</p><p>If countless Abyssal Blade Demons charged at them together from all directions&#x2026;Linley shuddered, just thinking about that terrifying scene. At the entrance to the valley, the combined of attacks of just around ten Abyssal Blade Demons had knocked Linley flying with their chops. If he hadn&#x2019;t had a Pearl of Life, Linley probably would&#x2019;ve died long ago.</p><p>Although Linley&#x2019;s spiritual energy could only encompass a very small area here, upon reaching the Saint level, their mental imaging abilities were extremely powerful. For example, Linley was able to mentally replay the &#x2018;Profound Truths of the Earth&#x2019; and further refine it. In the minds of Linley&#x2019;s group of experts, the location of the exit to the tenth floor was clearly marked, and they also knew exactly where they are and what direction they were flying so quickly in.</p><p>Thus, travelling underground area, it wouldn&#x2019;t be too hard to return to that exit. Even if they were off, they wouldn&#x2019;t be off by more than a thousand meters or so.</p><p>&#x201C;Everyone, hold on for a bit longer. We&#x2019;re almost at the exit.&#x201D; The Blackscale Scorpion&#x2019;s voice rang out in their minds.</p><p>All the experts felt a surge of energy, and they all strenuously resisted the constantly charging Abyssal Blade Demons. All of the experts put their strength on full display, and any who was heavily injured would immediately retreat to Desri&#x2019;s side to be healed, allowing other experts to replace them momentarily.</p><p>Linley also had the feeling&#x2026;</p><p>That the density of attacks from the Abyssal Blade Demons had reached a stable level. In addition, everyone&#x2019;s teamwork had reached an extremely high level as well.</p><p>&#x201C;Slash.&#x201D; The three Six-Eyed Golden Ni-Lions were once more sent retreating by the wild attacks of the Abyssal Blade Demons. Fain, Tulily, and Bebe immediately filled the gap, while Desri immediately began to heal the wounds of those three Six-Eyed Golden Ni-Lions. Fortunately, this sort of healing spell was of the ninth level, and thus to someone like Desri who could instacast them, it was not too troublesome.</p><p>&#x201C;We&#x2019;ve arrived at the exit to the tenth floor.&#x201D; Desri&#x2019;s excited voice rang out in everyone&#x2019;s mind.</p><p>The Blackscale Scorpion&#x2019;s tunneling direction suddenly shifted upwards as well, and the Abyssal Blade Demons attacking them suddenly dropped in number as well.</p><p>&#x201C;Most likely, many Abyssal Blade Demons are still moving to block us off in the direction we were previously heading.&#x201D; Tulily also noticed that only two or three Abyssal Blade Demons would occasionally appear and attack.</p><p>&#x201C;Everyone, don&#x2019;t let down your guard.&#x201D; Linley immediately instructed.</p><p>&#x201C;The three of us, plus Linley and Fain, will charge up first. The other experts will follow from behind.&#x201D; The voice of one of the Six-Eyed Golden Ni-Lions rang out in everyone&#x2019;s mind as well. In terms of defense, the three Six-Eyed Golden Ni-Lions were extremely powerful, while Linley and Fain both had Pearls of Life.</p><p>Nobody disagreed.</p><p>&#x201C;Swoosh.&#x201D; Charging upwards at high speed, Linley and the others spread out their spiritual energy.</p><p>&#x201C;There are no Abyssal Blade Demons in the twenty to thirty meters above us.&#x201D; Desri&#x2019;s voice rang out. They were already very close to ground level. Underground, spiritual energy penetrated a much lower distance than above ground.</p><p>&#x201C;Head up.&#x201D; Nobody hesitated at all at a time like this.</p><p>Linley and Fain led the upwards charge, with the three Six-Eyed Golden Ni-Lions behind them. The other experts formed the third unit and the fourth unit.</p><p>&#x201C;Boom.&#x201D; &#x201C;Boom.&#x201D; &#x2026;..</p><p>Linley&#x2019;s group of five erupted from the ground. Based on their current surroundings, they could immediately tell that they were only two hundred meters away from the exit. However, although Linley, Fain, and the other experts were able to locate the exit&#x2026;</p><p>Everyone felt misery in their hearts.</p><p>The path to the exit was blocked off by multiple layers of Abyssal Blade Demons; ten inner layers, and ten outer layers. Nearly ten thousand Abyssal Blade Demons were clustered there. With all those Abyssal Blade Demons there, how was Linley&#x2019;s group going to break through their guard and flee into the exit?</p><p>The worst part of it was&#x2026;</p><p>In the air above them, hovering like a storm of locusts, there were countless Abyssal Blade Demons, covering the skies like an endless horde.</p><p>&#x201C;How many Abyssal Blade Demons? A hundred thousand? Even more?&#x201D;</p><p>Linley, Fain, the three Six-Eyed Golden Ni-Lions&#x2026;everyone felt their hearts clench tightly.</p><p>&#x201C;Rumble&#x2026;&#x201D;</p><p>The countless Abyssal Blade Demons, upon seeing Linley&#x2019;s group, were like mosquitoes that had seen blood. They all charged over wildly at the same time. The sudden attack of nearly a million Abyssal Blade Demons was simply a terrifying, apocalyptic scene. Even nearby space itself seemed to rumble.</p><p>They were only a hundred meters away.</p><p>Instantly, those countless Abyssal Blade Demons arrived in front of Linley&#x2019;s group.</p><p>&#x201C;Back down, quick, quick, quick!!!&#x201D; Fain&#x2019;s terrified voice rang out in the minds of the other ten experts. Even Bebe, Rosarie, and Tulily, who had just left the underground, were scared silly by this sight. Almost in unison&#x2026;</p><p>They scurried back underground!</p><p>&#x201C;Bang!&#x201D;</p><p>The rumbling sound of nearly a million Abyssal Blade Demons running across the ground shook the world. Some ran in a straight line, while some charged downwards, but all of them simultaneously delivered vicious blows towards Linley&#x2019;s group!</p><p>&#x201C;Bang!&#x201D; A terrifying explosive force, and the area for several square kilometers around them exploded, with countless pieces of metal blasting everywhere. In the blink of an eye, a giant crater hundreds of meters deep was born, and in the center of the metallic crater, a large number of tunnels could now be seen.</p><p>Linley, Fain, and the three Six-Eyed Golden Ni-Lions had been the first to go above ground, and so they were the last to flee back underground. How far could they have gotten? In addition, this combined attack from countless Abyssal Blade Demons, which had all struck out at virtually the same time, had caused the energy of their blows to strike downwards like a single mighty ripple which smashed against the ground.</p><p>The &#x2018;rearguard&#x2019; of Linley, Fain, and the three Six-Eyed Golden Ni-Lions had to welcome this powerful attack.</p><p>Linley just barely managed to raised his adamantine heavy sword and Bloodviolet to block.</p><p>&#x201C;Bang!&#x201D;</p><p>Linley almost instantly felt a large number of saber flashes chop against his body. His &#x2018;Pulseguard Defense&#x2019; and his draconic scales almost instantly exploded, and even Linley&#x2019;s adamantine heavy sword and Bloodviolet sword were struck so hard that they flew backwards and struck against Linley.</p><p>&#x201C;Ah!!!&#x201D;</p><p>His entire body suddenly seemed shorter&#x2026;because as Linley looked down, he saw that his legs had been smashed into bits.</p><p>&#x201C;Flee, flee!&#x201D; Linley only knew that they had to flee.</p><p>The terrifying scene of those countless Abyssal Blade Demons charging towards them had already caused Linley&#x2019;s group&#x2019;s willpower to collapse. Linley noticed that next to him, beneath his chest Fain&#x2019;s entire body was gone, including both arms. Even his longsword was gone.</p><p>&#x201C;Second brother!&#x201D; A desolate howl rang out.</p><p>Flee!</p><p>Flee!</p><p>They fled wildly through the tunnels. After a long time had passed, they finally came to a halt, because there no longer were any Abyssal Blade Demons in pursuit of them.</p><p>Fain&#x2019;s body was quickly repairing itself, but it had only repaired up to his legs thus far. Fain&#x2019;s entire body was wracked in pain. And wasn&#x2019;t Linley in much the same situation? However, compared to the others, the two of them were already very lucky.</p><p>Of the three Six-Eyed Golden Ni-Lions, only two were left, and both of them were heavily injured, their bodies matted with blood.</p><p>&#x201C;Second brother did it to save us.&#x201D; The eldest Six-Eyed Golden Ni-Lion, Cleo, growled. The three siblings weren&#x2019;t like Linley and Fain, who had &#x2018;Pearls of Life&#x2019;. At the critical moment, the second of those three siblings had suddenly expanded his body to protect his two brothers.</p><p>The remaining ten experts looked at each other, and within their eyes, there was a hint of bitterness, pain, and&#x2026;despair!</p><p>What should they do now?</p><p></p><hr><p></p>
