<p><b><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> Book 15, Priceless Treasure &#x2013; Chapter 34, Highgod</span></b></p><p>Within the Fog Sea, Linley&#x2019;s group of four was flying at high speed. They were still only able to just barely see within a hundred meters of themselves. This ray of violet light&#x2019;s sudden appearance caused everyone to be alarmed.</p><p>A hundred meters distance, at the speed the violet light travelled, was not enough to allow one to dodge.</p><p>&#x201C;Boom!&#x201D; A low, rumbling collision sound.</p><p>The violet light smashed viciously against Bebe&#x2019;s waist, and Bebe was knocked flying backwards. This fairly thick ray of violet light was actually an entire pile of amethysts, and the collision force from the pile of amethysts actually caused Bebe to temporarily hurtle downwards at high speed, pulling away from Linley&#x2019;s group.</p><p>Olivier had been right behind Bebe, but Bebe had smashed right into him. This sudden collision caused Olivier&#x2019;s body to shudder and a hint of blood spurt out from his lips.</p><p>&#x201C;Bebe!&#x201D; Linley and Delia both turned to look.</p><p>Bebe was holding his stomach. Following the gravitational pull, he flew back towards them, and Olivier did the same. They came to a halt alongside Linley. Baring his fangs, Bebe pursed his lips and said, &#x201C;Boss, the striking power of those amethysts really is quite strong. It smashed straight into my stomach! Ouch!&#x201D;</p><p>Olivier wiped away the blood from his lips in astonishment.</p><p>Just now, that amethyst had easily pierced through Linley&#x2019;s body, and what&#x2019;s more, it had been travelling at such speed despite the gravitational pull. One could imagine how astonishing the speed was. And yet, an entire pile of amethysts had struck onto Bebe&#x2019;s stomach, but hadn&#x2019;t harmed Bebe at all.</p><p>Bebe had only been knocked into Olivier, and yet the force of that collision had caused Olivier to vomit blood. One could imagine how powerful the concussive power of those amethysts were! Linley actually laughed and joked, &#x201C;Bebe, your belly hurt for a moment, but you got an entire pile of amethysts out of it?&#x201D; Linley naturally knew how powerful Bebe&#x2019;s defense was.</p><p>Olivier stared in astonishment at Bebe. &#x201C;Bebe, the striking power of those amethysts was so great, and yet you&#x2026;?&#x201D;</p><p>Bebe delightedly raised an eyebrow. &#x201C;What, is it so strange? Are you kidding? Don&#x2019;t you know who I am? I&#x2019;m Bebe! Hey, Olivier, who told you to stand over there? Hurry up and get behind me.&#x201D; Bebe suddenly barked. After having seen what happened just now, Olivier understood how powerful Bebe was, and he immediately moved to stand behind Bebe.</p><p>Linley and Delia were in a line, while Bebe and Olivier were in a line.</p><p>In the boundless Fog Sea, Linley&#x2019;s group was unable to truly resist the gravitational force. All they could do was allow it to carry them in deeper.</p><p>&#x201C;Mountain peak!&#x201D; Bebe cried out in surprise.</p><p>Linley turned his head. Indeed, an entire mountain peak was smashing towards him.</p><p>A mountain peak smashing towards him?</p><p>Linley suddenly twisted his body, managing to force himself to one side. &#x201C;Hey, how did I dodge this?&#x201D; Linley was rather surprised. If it had been amethysts shooting at him, he wouldn&#x2019;t have been able to resist at all. But Linley instantly realized. &#x201C;This mountain isn&#x2019;t moving!&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;We arrived at the Amethyst Mountains. So we were dropping this entire time!&#x201D; Linley only now realized what direction they had been going in.</p><p>Under the pull of the gravitational force, Linley&#x2019;s group brushed past the mountain peak and continued to drop at high speed. This astonishing gravitational force caused all of them to drop astonishingly quickly, and the further down past the mountain peak they went, the vaster the mountain became. Linley suddenly, clearly noticed a large mountain rock flash past his eyes.</p><p>No time to dodge!</p><p>&#x201C;Bang!&#x201D; Linley&#x2019;s group smashed straight into this mountain boulder, halfway down the mountain. Although they had smashed into the mountain, the astonishing gravitational force still dragged down at them. The four were sent tumbling downwards by the gravity.</p><p>As their bodies continuously rolled downwards, Linley felt dizzy, especially after his head had hit the mountain rock.</p><p>&#x201C;Delia!&#x201D; Linley immediately grabbed the downwards tumbling Delia, while at the same time he viciously clawed at a protruding mountain rock, fixing himself onto the mountain.</p><p>Bebe immediately grabbed a mountain rock as well, no longer rolling downwards. As for Olivier, he continued to roll downwards, quickly disappearing.</p><p>&#x201C;Pant, pant!&#x201D; Linley panted a few breaths, then raised his head to look at Bebe. &#x201C;Bebe. Where&#x2019;s Olivier?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;He fell down.&#x201D; Bebe said hurriedly. &#x201C;I didn&#x2019;t have the chance to catch him.&#x201D;</p><p>Linley turned his head to glance at Delia. Delia wasn&#x2019;t injured either. Only now did Linley calm down and look at his surroundings. At the moment, the three of them were halfway down this mountain, and the area around them was covered in white fog. Linley&#x2019;s group couldn&#x2019;t see the bottom of the mountain at all.</p><p>&#x201C;Olivier probably fell down into the bottom.&#x201D; Delia said. &#x201C;Let&#x2019;s go down?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Down. Let&#x2019;s go down.&#x201D; Linley could still sense that astonishing gravitational force. &#x201C;Be careful. The gravity is too powerful. However, the stones of these Amethyst Mountains are sturdy as well.&#x201D; Linley gripped the protruding stone and sighed in astonishment as he spoke. The rocks of the entire Amethyst Mountains were all a dark red color.</p><p>Previously, when Linley had smashed head on against the mountain rocks, the mountain rocks actually hadn&#x2019;t shattered!</p><p>&#x201C;Linley, look. Amethysts!&#x201D; Delia laughed. Halfway down the mountain, there were one or two amethysts scattered about as well.</p><p>&#x201C;This place is the Amethyst Mountains. Naturally, there&#x2019;s many amethysts here.&#x201D; Bebe muttered, while at the same time punching hard against the mountain rocks. The dark red mountain rocks only shuddered, and a small crack appeared. Bebe stared in astonishment. &#x201C;My full force punch wasn&#x2019;t able to smash it apart!&#x201D;</p><p>As he spoke, Bebe withdrew that black dagger with a flip of his hand.</p><p>&#x201C;Crackle&#x2026;&#x201D; The black dagger forced its way down into the rock, cutting a large scar into the stone. Within the rock, aside from the dark red stone debris, there were scattered amethysts as well.</p><p>&#x201C;So there&#x2019;s actually amethysts within these rocks.&#x201D; Bebe laughed. And then, he shook his head. &#x201C;Only, it&#x2019;s so complicated. My dagger can even break through Highgod artifacts, but this rock&#x2026;I was only able to chop a chunk of it off. What&#x2019;s more, the amethysts are embedded into the rocky fragments. Getting them out will be complicated.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Let&#x2019;s go. Forget about the amethysts. Let&#x2019;s go down first.&#x201D;</p><p>Linley led them downwards.</p><p>The Amethyst Mountains were completely covered by white fog.</p><p>However, the outside world had never been able to know what the true appearance of the Amethyst Mountains was like. This was because no one who passed into the Fog Sea and entered the Amethyst Mountains had ever been able to escape. Linley&#x2019;s group was currently walking on the Amethyst Mountains, and had even arrived at the base.</p><p>&#x201C;It seems the white fog is thinner here!&#x201D; Bebe said, looking around himself.</p><p>The density of the white fog at the base of the mountains was lower. Linley&#x2019;s group was now able to see to a distance of two hundred meters.</p><p>&#x201C;Olivier!&#x201D; Linley immediately saw that nearby figure. &#x201C;Bebe, Delia, let&#x2019;s go over.&#x201D;</p><p>Olivier was currently looking around in concern. He was surrounded by that bewildering white fog. He had rolled all the way down, in the end landing at the base of this mountain peak. However, in the nearby area, he wasn&#x2019;t able to see any people at all. All he could see was some bloodstained corpses, their bodies shattered from the fall.</p><p>&#x201C;Best to wait here for Linley and them.&#x201D; Olivier didn&#x2019;t run about wildly. After all, the area around him was covered with white fog. If he ran about, he would very possibly be separated from Linley&#x2019;s group.</p><p>&#x201C;Olivier.&#x201D; Linley&#x2019;s voice rang out.</p><p>Olivier felt a surge of joy in his heart. He immediately turned and saw Linley&#x2019;s group of three running over. In this damnable place, being together with friends and helping each other made one feel more confident.</p><p>&#x201C;Why aren&#x2019;t there any others here?&#x201D; Bebe looked around as well, saying in a disdainful manner.</p><p>&#x201C;Don&#x2019;t be impatient.&#x201D; Linley laughed.</p><p>&#x201C;Swoosh!&#x201D; Suddenly, from above, multiple figures descended at high speed.</p><p>&#x201C;Bang!&#x201D; &#x201C;Bang!&#x201D; These multiple figures didn&#x2019;t stop at all, smashing viciously against the ground with a hollow, deep thudding sound. One could imagine how strong the collision force was. Linley&#x2019;s group of four looked at these five newcomers.</p><p>Bebe covered his mouth, beginning to laugh.</p><p>The five of them had fallen in terrible condition. Even their faces were scratched open. The five woke up after a while, then hurriedly began to use their divine power to repair their wounds while rising to their feet.</p><p>&#x201C;Did the four of you enter from the outside as well?&#x201D; The leader of the five, a green-haired man, spoke out.</p><p>&#x201C;Of course we came from outside.&#x201D; Bebe laughed as he responded. &#x201C;Just like you, we fell down from up above. However&#x2026;we were a bit better off than you. We weren&#x2019;t so unlucky as to smash into the ground.&#x201D; As he spoke, Bebe continued to cover his mouth and laugh.</p><p>The five couldn&#x2019;t help but have awkward looks appear on their face.</p><p>&#x201C;Bebe.&#x201D; Linley couldn&#x2019;t help but bark out. Bebe was simply too talented at causing trouble.</p><p>However, the five weren&#x2019;t too angry either. In this strange place, it was better for everyone to remain united. They, too, had discovered that Delia, a Highgod Fiend, was present. Their attitude naturally became all the more friendly towards Linley&#x2019;s group.</p><p>Linley glanced at the surrounding area. &#x201C;Let&#x2019;s go. We can&#x2019;t always stay here. Let&#x2019;s go to some other areas and take a look.&#x201D;</p><p>Linley&#x2019;s group of nine began to walk through the Amethyst Mountains. In but a short while, they encountered over a hundred people. Everyone had entered from within the Fog Sea. Naturally, they formed into a unit. This small unit was actually led by Delia.</p><p>Because&#x2026;Delia was the only Highgod!</p><p>This grand group of a hundred-plus people carefully made their way through the Amethyst Mountains.</p><p>&#x201C;The gravity here really is powerful. Even walking is so difficult.&#x201D; A voice came from behind.</p><p>&#x201C;It really is weird. Even the &#x2018;Gravitational Space&#x2019; of a Highgod would at most be at this level, but this gravity is in effect throughout the entire Amethyst Mountains. That&#x2019;s weird. Even the most powerful of Highgods can&#x2019;t set up such an enormous, large-scale &#x2018;Gravitational Space&#x2019;.</p><p>A conversation was going on in the rear. Walking in the front, Linley agreed. This sort of gravity truly was too astonishing.</p><p>&#x201C;Huh?&#x201D; Linley&#x2019;s face changed. &#x201C;Everyone, halt!&#x201D; Linley said loudly. Immediately, the hundred-plus people came to a halt.</p><p>&#x201C;What&#x2019;s going on?&#x201D; A question from behind.</p><p>But Linley just looked up ahead. In front of them, two figures could be seen. Just now, those two figures had flown past them, but when they reached a few dozen meters away from Linley, they suddenly came to a halt.</p><p>&#x201C;So fast.&#x201D; Linley was secretly surprised. &#x201C;Under the gravity of the Amethyst Mountains, they are still able to travel so quickly. These two are very powerful.&#x201D;</p><p>The two hesitated a moment, then began to draw near. The two both wore long black robes. Only, one of them was a man with long silver hair, while the other was a woman with long brown hair.</p><p>&#x201C;You came from the outside world?&#x201D; The brown haired woman said coldly.</p><p>&#x201C;Highgod?&#x201D; Linley&#x2019;s group was astonished. There were virtually no Highgods amongst the amethyst harvesters. However&#x2026;the two in front of them were actually both Highgods.</p><p>Linley was secretly startled. &#x201C;Who are these two people?&#x201D;</p><p>The brown-haired woman and the silver-haired man were both studying Delia, especially upon seeing the Fiend medallion on Delia&#x2019;s chest. Immediately, the brown-haired woman said, &#x201C;My name is Garlan [Jia&#x2019;lan]. I don&#x2019;t know who this Highgod Fiend is&#x2026;?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;My name is Delia.&#x201D; Delia said with a smile.</p><p>The silver-haired man laughed as well. &#x201C;Delia, hello. My name is Jarrod [Jia&#x2019;luo&#x2019;de]! The Amethyst Mountains are extremely dangerous. Since you, Delia, are a Highgod Fiend, how about you join with us? With the three of us joining forces, the chances of us staying alive will be higher.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Staying alive?&#x201D; Delia was stunned.</p><p>Linley couldn&#x2019;t help but be startled as well. So the situation really was dire!</p><p>&#x201C;These Amethyst Mountains are filled with many dangers. Even these two Highgod speak of &#x2018;staying alive&#x2019;&#x2026;&#x201D; Linley couldn&#x2019;t help but feel a sense of pressure. At this moment, the group of Gods behind Linley immediately grew nervous and started chatting amongst themselves. None of them were idiots.</p><p>Hearing the words of the silver-haired man, they understood that the Amethyst Mountains definitely were very dangerous.</p><p>&#x201C;Might I ask if I can bring a few people into the group?&#x201D; Delia asked.</p><p>&#x201C;You cannot.&#x201D; The brown-haired woman said with utter decisiveness. &#x201C;It is very dangerous right now. We aren&#x2019;t even certain of our ability to protect ourselves. How can we take on these additional nuisances? Delia, hurry up and choose. If you are willing to join us alone, with the three of us joined together, we should be able to survive this crisis.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;No need.&#x201D; Delia shook her head and refused politely.</p><p>The two Highgods couldn&#x2019;t help but be stunned.</p><p>&#x201C;Travelling with them, the only thing that will happen is that they will slow you down. They will be your doom!&#x201D; The silver-haired man, Jarrod, said hurriedly.</p><p>&#x201C;Hey, why all the pointless chitchat?&#x201D; Bebe barked unhappily. &#x201C;So what if she doesn&#x2019;t join you?&#x201D;</p><p>The silver-haired man couldn&#x2019;t help but glance at Bebe.</p><p>&#x201C;There&#x2019;s no need. Thank you for your good intentions.&#x201D; Delia said in refusal.</p><p>The silver-haired man and the brown-haired woman glanced at each other, shaking their heads.</p><p>&#x201C;If you aren&#x2019;t willing, then forget it. I just want to warn you of one thing.&#x201D; The brown-haired woman looked at Delia. &#x201C;Beware the amethyst beasts!&#x201D; After speaking, the brown-haired woman and the silver-haired man immediately flew away at high speed, instantly disappearing into the mist.</p><p></p><hr><p></p>
