<p><b><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> Book 6, The Road to Revenge &#x2013; Chapter 31, Won&#x2019;t Accept it</span></b></p><p>&#x201C;As I suspected, this genius of the Baruch clan is indeed capable of Dragonforming. Although it isn&#x2019;t quite the same as the Dragonblood Warriors of record, despite his youth, he already has the power of a warrior of the ninth rank. The Dragonblood Warriors live up to their reputation as one of the Four Supreme Warriors.&#x201D;</p><p>The Holy Emperor of the Radiant Church, Heidens [Hai&#x2019;ting&#x2019;si], had a hint of a smile on his face as he watched the going-on&#x2019;s below.</p><p>The thousand-plus casualties below and the blood-stained earth wasn&#x2019;t enough to make the Holy Emperor&#x2019;s heart quiver even slightly.</p><p>&#x201C;Kaiser, stop him!&quot; Clayde shouted frantically.</p><p>Clayde had never imagined that despite being in possession of a Fateguard, that he would be beleaguered to this extent. What&#x2019;s more, it was within the Holy Capital of Fenlai City.</p><p>&#x201C;Yes, your Majesty!&#x201D; Kaiser called out in response, while sweeping his greatsword&#xA0;towards Linley.</p><p>Linley didn&#x2019;t try to defend against this attack at all. &#x201C;Even if I have to take this blow head on, I am going to kill Clayde first.&#x201D; The death of his parents had filled Linley with boundless hatred towards Clayde. Only by killing Clayde would he be satisfied. Otherwise, even if he died, he would be unsatisfied!</p><p>&#x201C;Thud!&#x201D; The greatsword&#xA0;slammed against Linley&#x2019;s body.</p><p>Linley had been planning to take this blow head-on, but he suddenly realized that, bizarrely, this actually wasn&#x2019;t an attack against him at all. This blow was used to block Linley&#x2019;s charging momentum, while at the same time, Kaiser took advantage of the counter-force to knock himself flying towards Clayde at an astonishing speed.</p><p>&#x201C;Swish!&#x201D; Bebe once more charged towards Clayde.</p><p>&#x201C;Bam!&#x201D; That greatsword&#xA0;sliced through the air, blocking Bebe&#x2019;s way. Bebe used his fierce claws to exchange a vicious blow against the greatsword.</p><p>&#x201C;Clang!&#x201D;</p><p>Bebe only felt a fiery aura emanate from the surface of that greatsword, while at the same time, a fierce gust of battle-qi raged towards him. Bebe immediately dodged quickly, but nonetheless that fiery battle-qi struck his body. However, relying on his astonishing defensive abilities, Bebe only somersaulted through the air once before landing on the ground again.</p><p>Kaiser stood in front of Clayde, staring coldly at Linley and Bebe.</p><p>&#x201C;Boss, this guy is really tough!&#x201D; Bebe&#x2019;s fur was standing straight up, and he stared fixedly at Kaiser.</p><p>Linley could also sense Kaiser&#x2019;s power. In terms of speed, Kaiser wasn&#x2019;t a single bit slower than him, and when he struck with his sword, his speed was even more astonishing. This Kaiser was a true, full warrior of the ninth rank, with significant experience as well.</p><p>&#x201C;Who are you? Why are you trying to kill his Majesty?&#x201D; Sword in hand, Kaiser stared coldly at Linley.</p><p>Linley didn&#x2019;t speak. Tapping his waist, the Bloodviolet Godsword once more appeared in his hands. At the same time, Linley immediately utilized the wind-style supporting spell, Supersonic. A Supersonic spell of the seventh rank was still capable of raising Linley&#x2019;s speed a bit.</p><p>&#x201C;A double expert, both magus and warrior.&#x201D; The expression on Kaiser&#x2019;s face changed.</p><p>&#x201C;Clayde.&#x201D; Linley&#x2019;s gutteral voice rang out.</p><p>Right now, there were a group of warriors surrounding Clayde, but as far as Linley was concerned, aside from that Kaiser, none of them were capable of opposing him.</p><p>&#x201C;Swish!&#x201D; Linley furiously stomped the ground, causing the ground to split and crack. Relying on that powerful counterforce, Linley transformed into a merciless black blur and shot straight towards Clayde.</p><p>&#x201C;Whoosh!&#x201D; Bebe, being spiritually linked with Linley, shot out at the same time.</p><p>&#x201C;Chi! Chi!&#x201D; The Bloodviolet Godsword transformed into a violet blur of light, piercing directly at Kaiser. With a flip of his wrist, Kaiser&#x2019;s huge sword moved with surprising agility to block Linley&#x2019;s Bloodviolet. But just at that moment&#x2026;</p><p>That previously ramrod stiff Bloodviolet Godsword suddenly curved, avoiding Kaiser&#x2019;s sword and thrusting directly at Kaiser.</p><p>It was too close!</p><p>Kaiser didn&#x2019;t have the chance to dodge at all.</p><p>&#x201C;Bam!&#x201D;</p><p>Three centimeters away from Kaiser&#x2019;s body, the Bloodviolet Godblade suddenly came to a halt, ramming against a layer of blazing red battle-qi that was sprung up to protect Kaiser. As a warrior of the ninth rank, Kaiser was incredibly strong, even a bit more so than Linley.</p><p>This blow having failed, Linley didn&#x2019;t hesitate in the slightest, charging directly towards the nearby Clayde.</p><p>&#x201C;Halt!&#x201D; Kaiser let out a low shout, about to move to block Linley.</p><p>But from the corner of his eyes, Kaiser noticed a black blur suddenly arrive at the back of his neck. Kaiser knew exactly how terrifying this unique magical beast could be, and he didn&#x2019;t dare to use his battle-qi to forcibly block its fierce claws.</p><p>Kaiser hurriedly and agilely pivoted to dodge, putting some distance between him and Bebe. Flipping the greatsword&#xA0;in his hand again, he chopped directly at Bebe.</p><p>&#x201C;Kaiser, come save me!&#x201D; Clayde called out frantically.</p><p>Kaiser couldn&#x2019;t help but grow anxious. Both Linley and this terrifying magical beast had, without question, the power of a combatant of the ninth rank. What&#x2019;s more, that magical beast of Linley&#x2019;s possessed both incredible agility and terrifying defense. Kaiser was confident in his ability to deal with one, but dealing with two was a major headache.</p><p>&#x201C;Slash!&#x201D;</p><p>As the Bloodviolet Godsword cut through the air, it left behind a trail of severed limbs and sprays of blood.</p><p>Linley&#x2019;s dark gold eyes were fixed firmly upon Clayde, and he charged towards Clayde at high speed. Everyone who sought to block him was bisected by the Bloodviolet Godsword in Linley&#x2019;s hands. Blood had already dyed every inch of Linley&#x2019;s black scales!</p><p>With each step he took, he killed ten people!</p><p>&#x201C;Slash!&#x201D; After chopping away the last two warriors guarding Clayde, Linley charged directly towards Clayde.</p><p>&#x201C;Don&#x2019;t, don&#x2019;t kill me!&#x201D; Clayde was now truly afraid.</p><p>Kaiser was still being entangled by that astonishingly durable Bebe, and simply wasn&#x2019;t going to be able to come rescue him. As for the other warriors, they were nothing more than an afterthought to Linley. The power of Linley in his complete Dragonform was enough that he would only fear a combatant of the Saint-level. Even most warriors of the ninth-rank would not be enough to make Linley afraid.</p><p>&#x201C;Clayde, die.&#x201D;</p><p>This time, Linley didn&#x2019;t use his sword. With his right claw, he swiped viciously at Clayde&#x2019;s neck. He wanted to rip Clayde to death with his own hands.</p><p>&#x201C;Ah!&#x201D; Clayde hurriedly flew backwards at high speed, falling against a manmade hill.</p><p>But with a single twitch of his legs, Linley once more appeared in front of him. Those fierce claws arrived directly in front of Clayde&#x2019;s eyes.</p><p>&#x201C;Father. Mother. I&#x2019;ve finally avenged you.&#x201D; Linley&#x2019;s heart was shaking, and he brought his right claw down with force. The totally unprotected Clayde, in front of Linley, was like a toothless, claw-less animal.</p><p>Clayde&#x2019;s eyes were filled with terror and disbelief.</p><p>&#x201C;Thruuuuum.&#x201D;</p><p>An extremely strange vibration suddenly emanated from the sky. In the blink of an eye, it totally surrounded Linley, making him feel as though he was sunken in quicksand. His entire body had been bound, and he couldn&#x2019;t use any more force with his right claws.</p><p>If Linley were to use just a bit more force, he would be able to sever Clayde&#x2019;s neck. But Linley wasn&#x2019;t able to move at the slightest.</p><p>Clayde stared, stunned, and then he exulted wildly.</p><p>&#x201C;Ha&#x2026;hahahaha!&#x201D;</p><p>Clayde began to laugh loudly, and then he slowly retreated several steps before raising his head to stare at the sky. At this moment, a white-robed figure slowly floated over from up above in the sky. It was his Holiness, the Holy Emperor Heidens.</p><p>&#x201C;Your Holiness.&#x201D; Clayde immediately bowed respectfully.</p><p>All of the warriors nearby, Kaiser included, were stunned. But then immediately, they all bowed very respectfully and called out respectfully, &#x201C;Your Holiness!&#x201D;</p><p>The highest authority within the Holy Union. The man with the authority to depose a ruler from his rule. The Holy Emperor, Heidens, had appeared.</p><p>The Holy Emperor walked one step at a time towards Linley, and as he did, Linley suddenly felt as though he had escaped from the quicksand and could now move. But facing the Holy Emperor&#x2019;s gaze, Linley only felt his heart quiver.</p><p>&#x201C;Your Holiness!&#x201D; At this time, another squad rushed over, with two Cardinals leading them, along with several Executors from the Ecclesiastical Tribunal.</p><p>&#x201C;Heathen!&#x201D; Guillermo, seeing the totally Dragonformed Linley, was the first to speak, his face changing.</p><p>The Holy Emperor Heidens calmly glanced at Guillermo. Guillermo instantly fell silent, not daring to make another sound.</p><p>&#x201C;Get out.&#x201D;</p><p>Linley&#x2019;s gutteral voice rang out, causing the Holy Emperor Heidens to look at Linley with some surprise. Despite being affected by the power of his Presence, this man still was resisting? Heidens knew very well that his Presence was even more powerful than the presence of most Saint-level combatants, because Heidens was carrying several valuable treasures of the Radiant Church on him.</p><p>&#x201C;Surrender.&#x201D; Heidens spoke.</p><p>&#x201C;Whoosh!&#x201D;</p><p>Linley suddenly moved, transforming into a blur as he flew towards Clayde, while striking in an arc towards Clayde with that iron-whip-like draconic tail. Without question, the terrifying power of Linley&#x2019;s tail was enough to kill Clayde with one blow.</p><p>Heidens suddenly made a waving gesture with his right hand. &#x201C;WHAP!&#x201D; Linley&#x2019;s body was sent flying far away, slamming into a distant manmade hill. Rocks shattered, and blood began to seep out all across Linley&#x2019;s body. From this single blow, his astonishingly sturdy scales had been shattered to the point of allowing blood to be drawn.</p><p>Heidens glanced at Guillermo.</p><p>Guillermo understood what Heidens wanted. He shouted an order to the Executors of the Ecclesiastical Tribunal. &#x201C;Take this demon away!&#x201D;</p><p>Instantly, four Executors charged towards Linley.</p><p>&#x201C;Boss!&#x201D; Bebe&#x2019;s voice rang out in Linley&#x2019;s mind.</p><p>Linley was half-kneeling against the manmade hill, and blood was dribbling out of his mouth. &#x201C;Bebe. Leave. Leave now. While they haven&#x2019;t noticed you, leave!&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;I won&#x2019;t leave.&#x201D; Bebe was crouching off in the distance behind the corner of a wall, but continued to mentally converse with Linley.</p><p>&#x201C;No. With the Holy Emperor present, we no longer have any chance at all. He hasn&#x2019;t noticed you yet, so you have a chance to slip away. Bebe&#x2026;leave now. I must kill that Clayde. Even if I die, I need you to help me kill him. If even you are caught, in the future I will have no chance at all.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Boss&#x2026;&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Leave! Or else, even if I die, I won&#x2019;t forgive you!&#x201D; Linley roared mentally.</p><p>In the corner of that wall, Bebe stared at Linley, his little eyes filled with fury, grief, and an unwillingness to depart.</p><p>&#x201C;Leave now!&#x201D;</p><p>Linley mentally howled with fury at him. At this moment, those four Executors had walked to Linley&#x2019;s side and reached out, intending to subdue Linley. But that half-kneeling Linley suddenly rose to his feet, like a praying mantis attacking from ambush.</p><p>&#x201C;Swish!&#x201D; A violet light flashed. All four of them were bisected at the waist.</p><p>&#x201C;Die!&#x201D; Linley charged towards Clayde once again.</p><p>The expression on Clayde&#x2019;s face changed.</p><p>&#x201C;Even if I die, I will kill you first!&#x201D; Linley howled with rage.</p><p>&#x201C;Hrmph!&#x201D;</p><p>The eyes of the Holy Emperor Heidens flashed coldly, and he let out a sneer. His right hand slapped in Linley&#x2019;s general direction, and suddenly, a terrifyingly powerful force appeared out of nowhere, surrounding and pressing down Linley from all sides. Linley felt as though an enormous mountain had just slammed onto his body.</p><p>&#x201C;Bam!&#x201D; Linley was slammed into the ground.</p><p>&#x201C;Crack!&#x201D; Linley felt that the bones in his body were suddenly broken in over ten different places. Totally paralyzed, he lay there on the ground, unable to move again. Nobody, no matter how strong, would be able to move with so many bones broken.</p><p>&#x201C;Take him away.&#x201D; Guillermo once again ordered.</p><p>&#x201C;Boss&#x2026;&#x201D; Seeing the sorry state Linley was in, tears were flowing down Bebe&#x2019;s face.</p><p>Linley was lying on the ground, totally paralyzed. All the bones in his arms, legs and ribs were shattered. He couldn&#x2019;t move at all. The black scales covering him were in even worse shape, and blood flowed out from the flesh beneath the scales, dying his entire body red.</p><p>&#x201C;Boss.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Leave! Bebe, leave!&#x201D; Linley was mentally roaring with rage.</p><p>Several Executors of the Ecclesiastical Tribunal roughly lifted Linley up. Perhaps it was because they had just seen Linley murder four of their colleagues, but their hands were not gentle, and as they carried him, they didn&#x2019;t pay any attention to his wounds. This sort of carrying method caused Linley&#x2019;s entire body to be filled with agony.</p><p>As he was lifted and carried away, Linley continued to stare unblinkingly at Clayde.</p><p>&#x201C;Haha, haha&#x2026;&#x201D; Clayde began to laugh again.</p><p>Staring at Clayde with those dark gold eyes, Linley roared furiously, &#x201C;If I don&#x2019;t kill you, I won&#x2019;t rest! Even in death, I won&#x2019;t accept it!&#x201D; Linley&#x2019;s voice made the heart of that far-off Bebe quiver.</p><p>Hearing these words, Clayde&#x2019;s heart couldn&#x2019;t help but quiver as well.</p><p>&#x201C;I, won&#x2019;t, accept it!&#x201D; Two trails of tears cascaded down from Linley&#x2019;s eyes. He had been so close to victory. But in the end, he had still failed to kill Clayde.</p><p></p><hr><p></p>
