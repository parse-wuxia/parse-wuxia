<p><b><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> Book 13, Gebados &#x2013; Chapter 40, Creek, Ocean?</span></b></p><p>Go to the Infernal Realm?</p><p>Olivier&#x2019;s words caused everyone in the hall to look towards him. Linley was somewhat surprised. He said, &#x201C;Olivier, you are going to the Infernal Realm tomorrow? Why the rush? You can go to the Infernal Realm any time you want. In addition, the Yulan Plane is going to have another opening of the Necropolis of the Gods in a thousand years.&#x201D;</p><p>Most of the experts remaining on the Yulan continent were doing so because of the Necropolis of the Gods.</p><p>&#x201C;Necropolis of the Gods?&#x201D;</p><p>Olivier laughed self-mockingly. &#x201C;What&#x2019;s the point of remaining in the Yulan continent. Linley, can it be that you think that I, Olivier, will be able to compete against Adkins or against Lord Bluefire? I&#x2019;m just a Demigod. All I can do is watch, even if I stay behind. I might as well go to the Infernal Realm early.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;The Infernal Realm!&#x201D; Olivier&#x2019;s gaze drifted away, as though he was staring into the Infernal Realm right now. &#x201C;The legendary &#x2018;Infernal Realm&#x2019; of the Higher Planes, the place where countless top tier experts of countless material planes are clustered together. A place with more experts and which is more diverse than even the Planar Prison by trillions of times!&#x201D;</p><p>Everyone present, including Linley, Bebe, Delia, Tarosse, Dylin, and the War God all felt their hearts swayed.</p><p>They all knew how many experts were in the Planar Prison.</p><p>But compared to the Infernal Realm of the Higher Planes, the Gebados Planar Prison was nothing more than a tiny spot. After all, the &#x2018;Infernal Realm&#x2019; had attracted countless experts from the myriad material planes. After so many years, it was perhaps already impossible to calculate how many experts were there.</p><p>&#x201C;Right now, it feels like the Yulan continent has quite a few experts. However, the Yulan continent is nothing more than a small creek, while the Infernal Realm is an ocean filled with countless dangers. Although dangerous, it also contains boundless opportunities and challenges!&#x201D;</p><p>Olivier&#x2019;s eyes were shining. &#x201C;The Infernal Realm. I dream of going there! That is my stage!&#x201D;</p><p>Nobody tried to dissuade Olivier again.</p><p>Because&#x2026;</p><p>Olivier&#x2019;s words caused even Linley, Tarosse, and the other experts to feel rather itchy in their hearts. Indeed, the Planar Prison would generally only have a few people locked within it every ten thousand years. The vast majority of experts, by contrast, travelled to the Higher Planes. And these were experts from the countless planes of the universe.</p><p>It could be said&#x2026;</p><p>That most likely all of the experts in the various &#x2018;Planar Prisons&#x2019; in the countless planes of the world, all combined, wouldn&#x2019;t be as many as the number of experts within the &#x2018;Infernal Realm&#x2019;.</p><p>&#x201C;Creek, ocean?&#x201D; This echoed in Linley&#x2019;s mind.</p><p>The Yulan continent was like a leisurely, clear creek. After Adkins, Leylin and the others left, Linley definitely would be one of the most powerful creatures living within this &#x2018;creek&#x2019;. But if Linley were to go to the Infernal Realm and enter that &#x2018;endless sea&#x2019; filled with danger, the number of experts more powerful than Linley would be uncountable. That place had many people who had been training for far longer than Linley, or perhaps were even more talented than Linley, or perhaps had clans that were more terrifyingly powerful than Linley&#x2019;s.</p><p>However, the vast Infernal Realm caused Linley&#x2019;s heart to begin to boil with heated blood.</p><p>A life of challenges was what was needed for a person to be excited!</p><p>Deep at night. Within the bedroom, Linley and Delia were lying on the bed.</p><p>&#x201C;Linley, what are you thinking about?&#x201D; Delia said softly.</p><p>&#x201C;Me?&#x201D; Linley recovered from his reverie. He had just been thinking about the &#x2018;Infernal Realm&#x2019; of the Higher Planes. He had never gone there, so all he could do was imagine what it was like. &#x201C;Thinking about the &#x2018;Infernal Realm&#x2019;. I wonder what it is like there, and what the Infernal Realm has.&#x201D;</p><p>Delia&#x2019;s forehead creased slightly. She understood that Linley somewhat wanted to go to the Infernal Realm.</p><p>Delia, in her heart, didn&#x2019;t wish for Linley to go. In Delia&#x2019;s heart, she didn&#x2019;t want for Linley to experience danger time and time again. That sort of feeling of worry and fear would cause her to feel like she was on the verge of collapse. But Delia didn&#x2019;t say anything&#x2026;because she understood.</p><p>Liking Linley meant that she couldn&#x2019;t restrict him too tightly.</p><p>She respected Linley&#x2019;s decisions.</p><p>Linley sighed inwardly. He knew what Delia felt as well, but precisely because of this, Linley felt all the more grateful towards Delia. Delia had always quietly supported him. Linley suddenly remembered the wind-style divine spark he had acquired.</p><p>&#x201C;Delia, take a look. What is this?&#x201D; With a flip of his hand, Linley revealed a black divine spark glimmering with green light which floated in front of Delia&#x2019;s eyes.</p><p>Delia, seeing it, couldn&#x2019;t help but have her eyes light up. &#x201C;Wind-style divine spark? This&#x2026;this is that Nieff&#x2019;s divine spark?&#x201D; Linley had long ago told the details of what had happened to Delia. Delia also knew that Linley had a total of three divine sparks on him right now.</p><p>They were respectively, the earth-style divine God spark which had fallen into Linley&#x2019;s hands from when Barnas&#x2019; divine clone had been killed, the fire-style divine God spark from Anras&#x2019; failed assassination attempt, and then the wind-style divine God spark from Nieff.</p><p>&#x201C;Go take it and fuse with it.&#x201D; Linley laughed.</p><p>Looking at Linley, Delia finally accepted it. Delia knew&#x2026;given her level of talent, especially after having fused with a divine spark to become a Deity, relying on herself to gain insights and make breakthroughs would most likely require tens of thousands of years before she could break through.</p><p>Delia dripped blood onto the divine spark, taking it into her body. And then she rested her head against Linley&#x2019;s chest. In a gentle voice, she said, &#x201C;This divine spark was obtained through the hard work of my husband.&#x201D;</p><p>Linley couldn&#x2019;t help but laugh.</p><p>&#x201C;Delia, I&#x2019;ve heard that some of the clans in the Infernal Realm will use divine sparks to bring their descendants directly to the Highgod level.&#x201D; Linley sighed in praise, &#x201C;Three divine sparks in a row, and they become a Highgod. This sort of speed really is astonishing.&#x201D;</p><p>Fusing divine sparks was a symbol of low talent.</p><p>Experts generally wouldn&#x2019;t fuse with divine sparks. Even if one completely fused with a divine spark, the spark and one&#x2019;s own soul wouldn&#x2019;t be 100% compatible. To fuse with the profound mysteries within, the difficulty level would be hundreds of times greater than those who became Deities on their own.</p><p>&#x201C;I will definitely work hard to learn how to use the profound mysteries of the Laws within.&#x201D; Delia said.</p><p>Next morning at dawn. Although a hint of sunlight was already shining, it was still quite cold. However, a large group of people had already gathered at the training fields of Dragonblood Castle, because everyone was sending Olivier off.</p><p>This time, Olivier was going by himself to the Infernal Realm.</p><p>Dylin, Tarosse, Cesar, the War God, and the others all had matters to resolve in the Yulan continent first.</p><p>&#x201C;Olivier, kid, be careful in the Infernal Realm. Don&#x2019;t end up getting offed shortly after getting there. Haha&#x2026;&#x201D; Dylin laughed as he clapped Olivier on the shoulders. Olivier&#x2019;s eyes had a fierce light flash through them. &#x201C;Get offed by someone? Killing me won&#x2019;t be so easy.&#x201D;</p><p>Linley and the others all laughed and said a few final words to Olivier.</p><p>&#x201C;If we&#x2019;re lucky, perhaps in the Infernal Realm, I&#x2019;ll meet with everyone again.&#x201D; Olivier said with a smile. &#x201C;There&#x2019;s no need to say much more. I&#x2019;ll leave now.&#x201D; As he spoke, Olivier gave Linley a profound glance.</p><p>Linley could sense the hidden meaning within Olivier&#x2019;s gaze.</p><p>Olivier stared at Linley and said, &#x201C;Linley, I will wait for you in the Infernal Realm. Don&#x2019;t remain hiding in this little creek forever.&#x201D; After speaking, Olivier flew straight towards the north.</p><p>Linley couldn&#x2019;t help but be slightly stunned.</p><p>Delia and Wharton couldn&#x2019;t help but look towards Linley as well.</p><p>&#x201C;Creek?&#x201D; Linley&#x2019;s mind was very complicated right now.</p><p>&#x201C;Linley!&#x201D; A voice rang out directly in Linley&#x2019;s mind. Linley was startled. This voice belonged to Lord Beirut. &#x201C;Linley, you just came back from Mount Copper Gong not too long ago, right? These next two days, head over to my place and bring Bebe with you.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Bring Bebe?&#x201D; Linley was somewhat puzzled. What did Beirut want Bebe to go there for?</p><p>&#x201C;When you and Bebe get here, I&#x2019;ll tell you. Remember. Hurry up. Don&#x2019;t waste too much time.&#x201D; Beirut laughed.</p><p>&#x201C;I&#x2019;ll head over immediately.&#x201D; Linley replied.</p><p>&#x201C;No rush. This time, when Bebe comes, he&#x2019;ll most likely stay with me for quite a long period of time. You and him probably won&#x2019;t meet for a long time.&#x201D; Beirut said.</p><p>&#x201C;Hrm?&#x201D; Linley was somewhat surprised, but Beirut didn&#x2019;t explain in detail, instead withdrawing his divine sense.</p><p>The next afternoon, the sky was very blue, like a washed azure porcelain plate, with an occasional white cloud floating in the horizons.</p><p>Two figures were flying shoulder to shoulder through the skies. It was Linley and Bebe. The two had left Dragonblood Castle together, heading straight for the Forest of Darkness and the metallic castle within. Bebe was puzzled as well. He didn&#x2019;t know why Beirut was looking for him.</p><p>And from the sound of it, he would need to be separated from Linley for a long time.</p><p>In the vast Forest of Darkness, thousands of kilometers across, even kilometers in the air, one would still sense how vast and boundless this forest was. Upon seeing that metallic castle, Linley and Bebe descended downwards, and as they did, they sensed that ancient aura of the Forest of Darkness race towards them.</p><p>&#x201C;Come in.&#x201D; Beirut&#x2019;s voice rang out in Linley&#x2019;s mind.</p><p>Linley and Bebe immediately flew into the metallic castle.</p><p>&#x201C;Come to think of it, I&#x2019;ve never gone inside this metallic castle before.&#x201D; Linley laughed towards Bebe, who laughed widely, &#x201C;Boss, this metallic castle is quite special. It is very unique, and also very interesting.&#x201D;</p><p>Linley was intrigued by Bebe&#x2019;s words.</p><p>He couldn&#x2019;t help but take a closer look at this metallic castle. The inside of it was arranged extremely neatly, and every part of the metallic castle had a fluctuating metallic color. For example, the floor was a violet red metallic color which reflected light.</p><p>Some of the metal even formed small mountains, and within the garden, there were all sorts of flowers.</p><p>&#x201C;These flowers can&#x2019;t all be made from the metallic castle, right?&#x201D; Linley said to Bebe.</p><p>&#x201C;These aren&#x2019;t, no.&#x201D; Bebe shook his head. &#x201C;However, all of the metallic items here are made from the metallic castle itself. Boss, this metallic castle is very marvelous. Whatever you want it to transform into, it will.&#x201D;</p><p>Linley and Bebe spoke as they entered the living room.</p><p>Beirut was currently reading an extremely thick book. Not even lifting up his head, he said, &#x201C;Enter.&#x201D;</p><p>Linley entered the living room, glancing at the cover the book. &#x201C;Hey? These characters don&#x2019;t seem to be the same as the characters of our Yulan continent.&#x201D; Linley was puzzled.</p><p>&#x201C;Puzzled by these characters?&#x201D; Beirut raised his head to glance at Linley, then laughed, &#x201C;This came from an extremely long time ago. Even I don&#x2019;t know how many hundreds of millions of years old it is. At that time, the Yulan continent didn&#x2019;t even have humans. This was the time of the earth elemental civilizations, and this was the language of the time.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;However, the language which we currently speak in the Yulan continent was intentionally passed down by the Planar Overseer of that time, shortly after humans appeared. It is the same language which is spoken in the Infernal Realm, the Celestial Realm, the Netherworld, and the Life Realm.&#x201D; Beirut said.</p><p>Linley nodded.</p><p>&#x201C;Grandpa Beirut, you told me to come back yet again. What is this about?&#x201D; Bebe asked directly.</p><p>&#x201C;Of course there&#x2019;s a reason.&#x201D; Beirut began to laugh. &#x201C;The profound mysteries of the Laws you have gained insight into after becoming a Deity are the profound mysteries which we Godeater Rats will naturally gain upon reaching maturity. As a matter of fact, you yourself haven&#x2019;t actively gained insights into any profound mysteries. This time, I&#x2026;&#x201D;</p><p>Halfway through his words, Beirut suddenly looked towards the south in amazement. &#x201C;Huh? This guy&#x2026;&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Rumble&#x2026;&#x201D;</p><p>Suddenly, the elemental essence of the entire Yulan Plane, including not just the Yulan continent, but also the North Sea, the Arctic Icecap, and even the boundless South Seas, began to tremble. In particular, the elemental essence of the South Sea became to form into terrifying waves.</p><p>&#x201C;Boom&#x2026;&#x201D;</p><p>Fortunately, the South Seas were extremely vast. When this terrifying wave of elemental essence which came forth from it reached the Yulan continent, it was nothing more than an elemental ripple. But this elemental ripple was enough to cause any experts capable of sensing it to feel astonishment in their hearts.</p><p>&#x201C;This? What is this?&#x201D;</p><p>Linley immediately spread out his divine sense, instantly covering the entire Yulan continent with it. &#x201C;This elemental ripple covers an enormous area. And the origin of it seems to be even further south.&#x201D; Linley&#x2019;s spiritual energy, despite being powerful, couldn&#x2019;t reach the end, to the source of where this elemental ripple came from.</p><p>&#x201C;What scale! What tremendous scale!&#x201D; Beirut began to laugh.</p><p></p><hr><p></p>
