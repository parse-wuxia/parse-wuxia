<p><b><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> Book 14, Fiend &#x2013; Chapter 4, Royalwing City</span></b></p><p>Every single black dragon had a rider on its back, the vast majority of which were men.</p><p>&#x201C;Men still make up the vast majority of those who reached the Deity-level.&#x201D; Linley said to himself. Actually, in both the Yulan continent&#x2019;s experts as well as in the Redbud Army of the Infernal Realm, or currently here in the Black Dragon Tribe, the male to female ratio showed a simple truth.</p><p>Few women. Many men.</p><p>&#x201C;Linley, don&#x2019;t just stand there like an idiot. Hurry up and follow me.&#x201D; That Buffett flew deeper into the mountains, and Linley, Delia, and Bebe followed him. The meandering, winding mountains grew deeper and deeper. Everywhere in the mountains, residences could be seen now, all of which appeared so marvelous.</p><p>To Deities, building a residence was a very simple task.</p><p>After flying for a while, Buffett led Linley&#x2019;s group to land halfway up a high mountain. The area here was very large, at least a hundred meters across, more than enough for one to build a fairly large residence at.</p><p>&#x201C;In the future, you can stay here. As for the residence, you don&#x2019;t need me to help you build it, right?&#x201D; Buffett laughed.</p><p>&#x201C;Haha&#x2026;&#x201D; Linley laughed as well, and then suddenly stomped on the ground.</p><p>The floor of the mountain trembled, and a strange vibration spread out. One enormous boulder after another began to float into the air, and in accordance with a set rhythm, connected with each other. &#xA0;Light from the dimly glowing&#xA0;yellow earth elemental essences shot out in every direction. Buffett stared in great surprise at this scene.</p><p>Soon, a two-story building with a simple courtyard was finished.</p><p>&#x201C;The stones of the Infernal Realm really are heavy.&#x201D; Linley let out a sigh.</p><p>These stones were all similar to adamantite. In addition, the gravity here in the Higher Plane of the Infernal Realm was a hundred times that of the Yulan continent, causing each boulder to weigh as much as a small mountain peak in the Yulan continent.</p><p>&#x201C;So easily accomplished and so harmoniously done. Linley, can it be that you&#x2019;ve already reached the level of mastery in the Profound Mysteries of the Essence of the Earth?&#x201D; Buffett said with great surprise.</p><p>&#x201C;Not yet.&#x201D; Linley shook his head.</p><p>Buffett said unhappily, &#x201C;Linley, don&#x2019;t try to hide it. To be able to lift something so heavy&#xA0;with such ease and use these boulders of the Infernal Realm to create a manor, especially when making those boulders move in such a fluid, harmonious way&#x2026;although I don&#x2019;t train in the Laws of the Earth, I&#x2019;ve seen quite a few people who train in the Laws of the Earth.&#x201D;</p><p>Linley chuckled and didn&#x2019;t say anything further.</p><p>Actually, Linley truly hadn&#x2019;t yet reached the level of mastery in the Profound Mysteries of the Essence of the Earth. Only, because he had fused it with the Throbbing Pulse of the World, when utilizing it, it contained the Profound Truths of the Throbbing Pulse of the World. Naturally, he made it look easy.</p><p>&#x201C;You can live without fear here in my Black Dragon Tribe. I won&#x2019;t disturb you any further. If you need anything, in the future, you can ask me or ask anyone else.&#x201D; Buffett said.</p><p>&#x201C;Thank you, Mr. Buffett.&#x201D; Linley smiled.</p><p>After Buffett left, Linley, Delia, and Bebe entered their own residence.</p><p>&#x201C;It seems we&#x2019;ll have to make our own tables and chairs as well.&#x201D; Linley and the other two immediately began to take action. Linley controlled a boulder, making it fly over, and then used his palm to chop down using the principles of the Dimensional Decapitator. The boulder was immediately chopped into an extremely slick, smooth surface.</p><p>A black dagger appeared in Bebe&#x2019;s hands as well. It was extremely fierce.</p><p>In front of Bebe, a stone table quickly took form. As the three worked together, the stone table and three stone chairs quickly were completed.</p><p>&#x201C;Whew. Fortunately in the habit, I habitually store wine and some other things in my interspatial ring. Otherwise, in this place, we wouldn&#x2019;t have anything to drink.&#x201D; With a flip of his hand, Linley withdrew a flask of fine wine, and Bebe immediately called out in jubilation, &#x201C;Boss, you brought this as well?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;The Infernal Realm. A strange new place.&#x201D; Drinking the wine, Linley let out a sigh. As soon as they had entered the Infernal Realm, the vast majority of people they had encountered were all Deities. The weakest member of that Redbud Army was a God; that went without saying. But even here in the Black Dragon Tribe, everyone was a Deity.</p><p>This was a world of Deities!</p><p>&#x201C;Boss. The distance between us and that Bloodridge Continent is way too far. What we going to do?&#x201D; Bebe was somewhat worried. &#x201C;That Buffett even said that if we run around wildly, we probably won&#x2019;t live for more than three days.&#x201D;</p><p>Delia frowned as well. &#x201C;Let&#x2019;s not be hasty. Let&#x2019;s first find our footing here in the Infernal Realm.&#x201D;</p><p>Linley nodded as well. &#x201C;The Infernal Realm isn&#x2019;t the Yulan continent. Experts are as common as the clouds. We can&#x2019;t just go wherever we want to go. Everything else aside, we don&#x2019;t even know the general, basic geography of the Infernal Realm.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Knock!&#x201D; &#x201C;Knock!&#x201D; &#x2026;.. Suddenly, the sound of knocking on the door could be heard.</p><p>&#x201C;I&#x2019;ll get the door.&#x201D; Bebe leapt over, then easily pulled open the extremely heavy stone door. Behind the stone door, there was a delicate-looking, golden-haired youngster, who laughed as he greeted them. &#x201C;Hey there. I&#x2019;m Krate [Kui&#x2019;te]. I live very close to you.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;My name is Linley. Please, come in!&#x201D; Linley rose and spoke.</p><p>Linley could immediately tell that this Krate was a Demigod.</p><p>&#x201C;My big brother and I live together to your north, also halfway up the mountain. I heard you just arrived in the Infernal Realm.&#x201D; Krate was very warm and friendly.</p><p>&#x201C;Please take a seat. This is some fine wine from my homeland. Have a taste.&#x201D; Linley said.</p><p>&#x201C;Wine?&#x201D; Krate&#x2019;s eyes lit up, and he immediately sat down at the seat which Bebe had been sitting on. He hurriedly drank a cup, half-closing his eyes in satisfaction. &#x201C;This wine really is excellent. Although it can&#x2019;t compare to the fine wine sold in Royalwing City, it&#x2019;s quite good to be able to drink any wine at all.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Royalwing City?&#x201D; Linley was somewhat puzzled.</p><p>Suddenly understanding, Krate said, &#x201C;Oh, right, you just arrived in the Infernal Realm. There&#x2019;s many things you don&#x2019;t know&#x2026;in our Nightblaze Prefecture, there are a total of ten cities that are scattered throughout Nightblaze Prefecture. The city closest to us is Royalwing City, roughly ten million kilometers away or so.&#x201D;</p><p>Linley and the others were shocked.</p><p>Ten million kilometers, and that was the nearest one?</p><p>&#x201C;However, to enter Royalwing City, you have to pay a fee of an inkstone.&#x201D; Krate cursed softly. &#x201C;They really are greedy!&#x201D;</p><p>Krate let out a sigh. &#x201C;Only, if you actually want to buy some things, or sell off your dragon saliva, or a divine artifact, it&#x2019;s still better to do the trade within Royalwing City.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Trade can only be done in Royalwing City?&#x201D; Delia didn&#x2019;t quite believe it. &#x201C;It makes sense for large transactions to be made within Royalwing City. But what about smaller transactions?&#x201D; As Delia saw it, this was the sort of logic of the stores of the Yulan Plane.</p><p>Cities had larger stores, while smaller towns also had some small shops.</p><p>&#x201C;Generally speaking, smaller transactions can be carried out at the chief&#x2019;s place within the tribe. However, generally speaking, a Demigod artifact can be sold for seven inkstones in Royalwing City, while the chief will only give you five inkstones for it.&#x201D; Krate was somewhat unhappy about this.</p><p>Linley and the others understood. After all, Royalwing City was over ten million kilometers away from here.</p><p>&#x201C;Wait. I heard Buffett say that a divine artifact was worth around ten inkstones.&#x201D; Bebe said, and Linley suddenly remembered as well.</p><p>Krate said disdainfully, &#x201C;When he said ten inkstones, he was referring to the selling price in Royalwing City, the retail price. When we sell them, we naturally are only able to get seven inkstones.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Krate, I want to ask you, if I wanted to go to another continent, how should I go?&#x201D; Linley asked.</p><p>Krate stared. &#x201C;Another continent? Good heavens. Redbud Continent is already enormous. In the entire Infernal Realm, there are a total of 108 prefectures. Our Redbud Continent seems to have nearly twenty prefectures, each one of which covers an extremely vast area&#x2026;going to another continent is too hard.&#x201D;</p><p>Linley had a thought. &#x201C;A continent only has nearly twenty prefectures. It seems each Lord Prefect has an extremely high status as well!&#x201D;</p><p>In the Infernal Realm, the status of the Lord Prefects was second only to the Seven Rulers.</p><p>&#x201C;Whew, this wine really is nice.&#x201D; Krate drank another cup of wine, then stood up. Laughing, he said, &#x201C;You just arrived, so I won&#x2019;t disturb you any further. In the future, if there&#x2019;s anything you need, you can come look for me. Right. Linley, that beauty next to you&#x2026;be careful. The Infernal Realm has too few women. I expect that some people will come to try and pursue and woo that beauty you have there.&#x201D;</p><p>Linley and Delia were both astonished.</p><p>&#x201C;Who dares?! I&#x2019;ll off him with my knife!&#x201D; Bebe growled angrily.</p><p>&#x201C;Haha, I&#x2019;m just saying. Anyhow, I&#x2019;ll leave now.&#x201D; Krate chuckled twice, then left.</p><p>Linley and Delia glanced at each other, then began to laugh. Delia said softly, &#x201C;Linley, in the future, if someone is pursuing your wife, what will you do?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;What will I do? I&#x2019;ll clobber any who comes.&#x201D; With a flip of his hand, Linley retrieved the adamantine heavy sword and gave it two twirls.</p><p>Chasing after someone else&#x2019;s women really did happen quite frequently. With Linley&#x2019;s group in the Black Dragon Tribe, there really were people who came to get into Delia&#x2019;s good graces. However, Delia herself shouted at them, while Linley in particular transformed into three clones and began to trample on them as Bebe would add a few flying kicks.</p><p>Quickly, nobody in the Black Dragon Tribe dared to have any further designs on Delia.</p><p>They had already been in the Black Dragon Tribe for two months. Linley and the other two had slowly grown accustomed to this place.</p><p>&#x201C;Two fighting over a single woman. The two men are both Demigods. Neither of them know how to use spiritual attacks. All they can do is use material attacks.&#x201D; Linley raised his head up to stare in the air above the Black Dragon Tribe. Two muscular figures were engaging in a battle.</p><p>Not just Linley and Bebe were watching. There were thousands of people present, watching this battle, nearly a quarter of the total population of the Black Dragon Tribe.</p><p>&#x201C;What&#x2019;s going on with those two? Why do they have to fight? Can&#x2019;t they just ask what that girl named Catelyn [Ka&#x2019;te&#x2019;lin&#x2019;] wants?&#x201D; Delia was somewhat puzzled. At this time, a figure wearing a grass hat flew over at high speed. Bebe laughed repeatedly, &#x201C;Boss, I already know the inside details on their battle.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Tell.&#x201D; Linley said with curiosity.</p><p>&#x201C;That golden-haired man is named Kendita [Kan&#x2019;di&#x2019;ta]. Kendita and that Catelyn come from the same material plane. Their relationship is quite good. But of course, they haven&#x2019;t reached the stage of sleeping on the same bed yet.&#x201D; Bebe rubbed his nose, raising his head as he spoke. &#x201C;That black-haired man is Kimpton [Jin&#x2019;pu&#x2019;dun]. He used to be a Gerrard Black Dragon!&#x201D;</p><p>Linley was somewhat surprised. &#x201C;Did you just say that Kimpton was one of the Gerrard Black Dragons they raised?&#x201D; The Black Dragon Tribe raised Gerrard Black Dragons to earn inkstone. Linley&#x2019;s group knew this.</p><p>The Black Dragon Tribe had a rule. If a Gerrard Black Dragon was able to reach the Deity level and transform into human form, then they could join the Black Dragon Tribe. Because of this rule, the Gerrard Black Dragons all had a hint of a hope for the future.</p><p>&#x201C;Right.&#x201D; Bebe nodded hurriedly. &#x201C;That Kimpton was originally a Gerrard Black Dragon that had been raised here. After a long period of time, the Gerrard Black Dragon actually reached the Deity level. That&#x2019;s Kimpton.&#x201D;</p><p>Linley grew curious.</p><p>&#x201C;Perhaps because of how long she had been raising him for, Catelyn treated Kimpton very well. When Kimpton transformed into human form, he actually began to pursue Catelyn. This Black Dragon has fallen for Catelyn.&#x201D; Bebe began to snicker. &#x201C;Naturally, this makes Kendita unhappy. How can he allow the woman he likes to be together with a Black Dragon, even if the Black Dragon is now in human form? Thus, the two began to fight. Only, they are just Demigods, and they only have insights into very basic mysteries. Their attacks are essentially nonlethal, which is why their battle has gone on for so long. This isn&#x2019;t the first or second time this has happened.&#x201D;</p><p>Linley couldn&#x2019;t help but feel speechless.</p><p>But right at this moment.</p><p>From afar, a black robed shadow flew over in the air above the mountain ranges. The two battling Demigods, upon seeing the newcomer, were immediately frightened and flew down at high speed. Upon seeing the medallion this black-robed man wore on his chest, a sharper-eyed onlooker was shocked as well and cried out in alarm, &#x201C;Ah, a Fiend!&#x201D;</p><p>The other onlookers of the Black Dragon Tribe who had been watching the battle all raised their head, and their faces instantly changed from fear. They immediately scattered in every direction.</p><p>&#x201C;Fiend?&#x201D; Linley raised his head in confusion.</p><p></p><hr><p></p>
