<p><b><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> Book 11, Necropolis of the Gods &#x2013; Chapter 37, Divine Spark </span></b></p><p>The metallic ground flashed with cold light. Countless Abyssal Blade Demons knelt on that ground respectfully in terror, while in mid-air, their leader, the red Abyssal Blade Demon, respectfully led Linley, and the two transformed into rays of light towards the direction of the divine spark.</p><p>There were, in total, three Necropolis of the Gods which were connected to the Yulan continent.</p><p>This Necropolis of the Gods connected to the underground tunnel at the bottom of the South Sea was the most dangerous one and the largest one. On this eleventh floor of the Necropolis of the Gods, ever since it had been constructed, not a single Saint-level expert had been successful in acquiring the treasures hidden within the floor. Linley was the first!</p><p>The wind blew, stirring Linley&#x2019;s long hair.</p><p>Linley was already back in human form, casually draping a long robe over his body. The wind rustled through it, occasionally revealing his bare chest.</p><p>&#x201C;After having gained insight into the Profound Truths of Velocity, whether or not I Dragonform no longer makes much of a difference.&#x201D; Linley was wielding Bloodviolet in his hands. Bloodviolet&#x2019;s &#x2018;Dimensional Decapitator&#x2019; ability could be described as a &#x2018;miniature Dimensional Edge&#x2019;. Any Saints who touched it would die.</p><p>The red Abyssal Blade Demon led the way nervously.</p><p>Suddenly, the red Abyssal Blade Demon halted.</p><p>&#x201C;Are we there?&#x201D; Linley asked.</p><p>The red Abyssal Blade Demon pointed off into the distance and said respectfully, &#x201C;Lord, the treasure of the eleventh floor of the Necropolis of the Gods is atop the mountain peak over there.&#x201D;</p><p>Linley gazed in the direction of the Abyssal Blade Demon&#x2019;s finger. Off in the distance, there was indeed a small metallic mountain, but this mountain was covered with a large number of Abyssal Blade Demons, and even in the air above it, there were many Abyssal Blade Demons hovering.</p><p>&#x201C;Hrm, what&#x2019;s this?&#x201D; Linley frowned.</p><p>Terrified, the red Abyssal Blade Demon hastened to explain. &#x201C;Lord, in the past, we were afraid that intruders would run wild and arrive here. Therefore, we arranged several tens of thousands of Abyssal Blade Demons to be stationed here and watch over this important treasury location.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;It seems you were quite thorough.&#x201D; Linley laughed calmly.</p><p>The red Abyssal Blade Demon said hurriedly, &#x201C;Lord, don&#x2019;t worry. I&#x2019;ll immediately order them to stand down.&#x201D; As he spoke, the red Abyssal Blade Demon immediately flew towards that mountain.</p><p>On the third level of the Necropolis of the Gods.</p><p>A cold wind was blowing. Aside from a few corpses of Saints, the only one remaining here was the still-slumbering Ba-Serpent. &#x201C;Whooosh!&#x201D; &#x201C;Hiss!&#x201D; &#x2026;. Each time the Ba-Serpent exhaled, that black energy came out. The only sound in the third floor was that familiar snoring.</p><p>All of a sudden, the Ba-Serpent&#x2019;s enormous body, wrapped around that giant iceberg, suddenly vanished.</p><p>&#x201C;Unexpectedly, a human succeeded?&#x201D; A devilish young man a slender body and devilish, flowing green hair stood there in mid-air. He wore a patterned blue robe over his body, and the patterns on the blue robe, on close inspection, appeared to be those of a snake&#x2019;s skin.</p><p>&#x201C;He succeeded. That means I&#x2019;m more or less free as well. There&#x2019;s no need for me to remain here on these eleven floors any longer.&#x201D; He revealed a smile on his face. &#x201C;Unfortunately, I still have to wait for Lord Beirut to come over. I&#x2019;ll have to at least wait for a few more months. After having been here for so long though, a few more days won&#x2019;t matter.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x2026;&#x2026;&#x2026;...</p><p>A large number of Abyssal Blade Demons were beating a hasty retreat, allowing Linley to fly to the peak of the mountain.</p><p>&#x201C;Whoosh.&#x201D; A heart-stopping aura surged towards him. Linley&#x2019;s eyes lit up, and he stared carefully at that mountain peak. There was a heap of precious treasures placed atop the flat, enormous stone on top of the mountain. The most attractive of them, however, was naturally those three divine sparks, which emanated a divine aura.</p><p>Aside from the three divine sparks, the enormous flat stone also had a series of divine artifacts. Ten of them!</p><p>&#x201C;Three divine sparks, ten divine artifacts! The almighty Sovereign is truly quite generous.&#x201D; Linley felt his heart rate speed up. After all, countless Saints had dreamed about acquiring just a single divine spark, but now, three of them were placed in front of him.</p><p>Not worrying about anything else, Linley immediately walked over to the flat boulder to carefully inspect those three divine sparks.</p><p>Those three divine sparks were the same color. All of them were black. Only, within the hearts of the three divine sparks, two of them emanated a faint light; one of them emanated a faint blue light, while the other one emanated an earthen yellow light. As for the last one, it didn&#x2019;t emanate any light at all. Instead, it had a strange, hidden aura emanating forth from it.</p><p>&#x201C;One is earth-style, while the other is wind-style. The last one is Destruction-style.&#x201D; Linley frowned. &#x201C;And the divine sparks here on the eleventh floor should all be Demigod sparks.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;What is going on?&#x201D; Linley&#x2019;s heart was filled with suspicion.</p><p>&#x201C;Could it be that the controller of this Necropolis of the Gods knew that the person acquiring the treasures would be someone who trained in the profound truths of these two Elemental Laws of the Wind and the Earth?&#x201D; Linley knew very well that this destruction-style divine spark actually belonged to the &#x2018;Way of Destruction&#x2019;.</p><p>Linley, being a practitioner of the sword, could also train in this Way.</p><p>&#x201C;Three divine sparks, and I&#x2019;m capable of using any of them. How could there be such a coincidence? Precisely three of them!&#x201D; Linley stared at the three divine sparks in front of him, a strong sense of suspicion in his mind.</p><p>Linley turned his head and stared around him.</p><p>He suddenly had a feeling as though everything going on in the Necropolis of the Gods was being watched by the Sovereign from on high.</p><p>&#x201C;Perhaps&#x2026;&#x201D; Linley looked at the three divine sparks. &#x201C;These three divine sparks were only placed here after I gained insight into the &#x2018;Profound Truths of Velocity&#x2019;. Perhaps an ultimate expert stealthily placed them here afterwards.&#x201D; Linley couldn&#x2019;t help but suspect this. After all, this was simply too great a coincidence.</p><p>Exactly three divine sparks?</p><p>Why weren&#x2019;t they lightning-style, or light-style, or fire-style? They all suited Linley&#x2019;s nature and elements.</p><p>&#x201C;I should feel proud to have been looked after by this sort of ultimate expert.&#x201D; Linley self-mocked silently. Linley no longer pondered this question. No matter what, he was currently just a person who had only reached the doorstep to becoming a Deity, and was only a Prime Saint, not yet a god.</p><p>There were many secrets and mysteries which he was not yet qualified to be a part of yet.</p><p>&#x201C;I can already dimly sense the Deity-level. Most likely, once I go back and train, in a few dozen years, I will reach the Deity-level.&#x201D; Linley, after becoming aware of the &#x2018;Profound Truths of Velocity&#x2019;, could already faintly sense his current level of understanding.</p><p>Linley had heard the War God speak of this before as well.</p><p>Becoming a Deity by one&#x2019;s self was hundreds of times more difficult than fusing a divine spark. Linley stretched out his hand, immediately grasping those three divine sparks, then drawing them into his interspatial ring. &#x201C;Even if I personally don&#x2019;t use these three divine sparks, I can give them to Delia and Wharton to use.&#x201D;</p><p>Given Delia and Wharton&#x2019;s levels of talent, it would be extremely difficult for them to become Deities on their own.</p><p>Just by looking at how Fain and Desri had been stuck at the doorway to Deity-hood for thousands of years, one could imagine how hard it was.</p><p>Linley himself was fortunate enough that after developing the &#x2018;Tempos of the Wind&#x2019;, he encountered the Queen Mother&#x2019;s attack and by mimicking it, developed the &#x2018;Myriad Swords Converge&#x2019;. Afterwards, due to reaching the Grand Magus Saint level, he was able to clearly sense the mysteries hidden within the &#x2018;Dimensional Edge&#x2019;.</p><p>With this chain of three events&#x2026;</p><p>In addition, Linley only had some insights in the &#x2018;Fast&#x2019; and &#x2018;Slow&#x2019;, and they weren&#x2019;t at a very high level yet.</p><p>In terms of power, the &#x2018;Profound Truths of Velocity&#x2019; were actually a level higher than the &#x2018;Profound Truths of the Earth&#x2019;. The &#x2018;Profound Truths of Velocity&#x2019; could be said to be one of the highest, most profound mysteries of the Elemental Laws of the Wind.</p><p>&#x201C;I wonder how Delia, Taylor, Sasha, and Wharton are doing.&#x201D; Linley couldn&#x2019;t help but think of his family. &#x201C;And I don&#x2019;t know how Barker&#x2026;&#x201D; Linley, in his heart, was still worried about whether Barker was alive or not.</p><p>Linley sighed in his heart.</p><p>And then, Linley looked at the ten divine artifacts. These ten divine artifacts included saber, sword, and spear-type weapons, a black book, a mysterious crystal ball, and&#x2026;a set of battle-armor. Deity-level battle armor.</p><p>&#x201C;Battle armor?&#x201D; Linley felt joy in his heart.</p><p>Linley didn&#x2019;t care too much about the other divine artifacts; after all, he already had the adamantine heavy sword and Bloodviolet. The black book and crystal ball were most likely darkness-style or Necromantic-style divine artifacts. Linley wouldn&#x2019;t be able to use them well.</p><p>Linley immediately stored these ten divine artifacts into his interspatial ring.</p><p>&#x201C;These divine artifacts would be useful as gifts to Delia, Taylor, Sasha, and the others.&#x201D; Linley laughed as he stared around the mountain peak. &#x201C;It seems there aren&#x2019;t any other treasures here. Oh, right&#x2026;this.&#x201D; Linley stared at the flat boulder where the divine artifacts had been stored.</p><p>&#x201C;A rich person certainly behaves generously. Even this boulder used to hold these divine artifacts is a treasure.&#x201D; Linley stored the giant boulder into his interspatial ring as well.</p><p>This enormous flat boulder was actually something he had read about in the books. &#x2018;Bloodstone&#x2019;.</p><p>Bloodstones were almost as valuable as adamantine ore. It was a type of treasure from other planes. Whether made into magus tools or weapons, it was an extremely good type of material. If one used materials such as bloodstones and adamantine to forge a weapon, one could make a divine artifact.</p><p>Linley&#x2019;s adamantine heavy sword, although a good weapon, wasn&#x2019;t actually a divine artifact.</p><p>With a smile, Linley descended from the air, flying away from the mountain.</p><p>The distant red Abyssal Blade Demon waited nervously. Linley hadn&#x2019;t ordered him to leave, so he didn&#x2019;t dare to leave on his own, for fear that Linley would kill him in anger.</p><p>&#x201C;Congratulations, Lord.&#x201D; The red Abyssal Blade Demon, seeing Linley fly over, immediately said respectfully.</p><p>Linley glanced at the red Abyssal Blade Demon, then noticed that blood-red blade on its back. Reaching out with his hand, Linley pointed to the warblade on the red Abyssal Blade Demon&#x2019;s back. &#x201C;Right. Your blade, as well as the warblades from the other two red Abyssal Blade Demons. Bring them to me.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Huh?&#x201D; The red Abyssal Blade Demon stared at Linley in shock.</p><p>&#x201C;Didn&#x2019;t you hear me?&#x201D; Linley frowned.</p><p>&#x201C;Lord, this&#x2026;this warblade was naturally created from my body. It took me hundreds of thousands of years. This&#x2026;&#x201D; The red Abyssal Blade Demon was somewhat unwilling.</p><p>These Abyssal Blade Demons were made of blades, but the most powerful blade was the one on their backs. That was the place where their essence was concentrated, and that blade was incomparably hard and powerful. Originally, when Linley&#x2019;s group had encountered that ordinary Abyssal Blade Demon on the tenth floor, the sharpness of its blade was already approaching that of a divine artifact.</p><p>The blades of the red Abyssal Blade Demons were definitely at the divine artifact level.</p><p>After developing the &#x2018;Dimensional Decapitator&#x2019; and slaughtering the Abyssal Blade Demons, he had discovered&#x2026;that his Dimensional Decapitator was completely unable to damage the warblades of the Abyssal Blade Demons. One could imagine how sharp and tough they were.</p><p>&#x201C;Hrm?&#x201D; Linley frowned, staring coldly at the red Abyssal Blade Demon.</p><p>Life or blade. Which one was more important? This question didn&#x2019;t need to be asked.</p><p>&#x201C;Right, Lord. I&#x2019;ll immediately send people to obtain the other two warblades.&#x201D; The red Abyssal Blade Demon, terrified, immediately pulled out the blade from his back, respectfully offering it to Linley.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Right. Bring me a thousand warblades from the ordinary Abyssal Blade Demons as well.&#x201D; Linley said casually.</p><p>Although the red Abyssal Blade Demon was astonished, he didn&#x2019;t dare to say anything. After all, Linley had killed a hundred thousand Abyssal Blade Demons. A thousand warblades wasn&#x2019;t much. Only, he secretly said to himself, this expert in front of him was perhaps a bit too&#x2026;a bit too &#x2018;that&#x2019;. He was already so powerful, but he still wanted so many warblades.</p><p>&#x201C;Although I don&#x2019;t need it, I can give it to the descendants of the clan.&#x201D; Linley said to himself secretly.</p><p>Even the warblades of ordinary Abyssal Blade Demons were comparable to the adamantine heavy blade in preciousness. This sort of warblade would definitely be considered an extremely valuable weapon on the Yulan continent.</p><p>&#x201C;Unfortunately, my interspatial ring isn&#x2019;t big enough.&#x201D; Linley secretly said to himself.</p><p>If it was larger, Linley would perhaps take even more, but a thousand warblades was already enough.</p><p>After storing the thousand warblades and the three red warblades into his interspatial ring, with countless Abyssal Blade Demons kneeling towards him, Linley returned to the tenth exit.</p><p></p><hr><p></p>
