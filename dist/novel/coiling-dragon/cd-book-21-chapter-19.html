<p><b><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> Book 21, The Peak &#x2013; Chapter 19, Orloff&#x2019;s Invitation</span></b></p><p>Within the void, the white-robed Chief Sovereign of Fate continued to stand there calmly.</p><p>&#x201C;Whoosh!&#x201D; &#x201C;Whoosh!&#x201D;</p><p>Around the torso, the legs, and the shoulders of the Chief Sovereign of Fate, a hazy light swirled and constricted. It seemed like water that was boiling and bubbling around him. The hazy aura of light frothed atop the Chief Sovereign of Fate, but the Chief Sovereign of Fate&#x2019;s gaze was locked upon the spear that was stabbing towards him.</p><p>The black spear came piercing over.</p><p>In this moment, the Chief Sovereign of Fate&#x2019;s gaze suddenly grew sharp.</p><p>&#x201C;Whoosh&#x2026;&#x201D; His right hand suddenly swept out, seemingly sweeping the heavens before him. Even the locked space around him began to tremble.</p><p>&#x201C;Whap!&#x201D;</p><p>The right hand of the Chief Sovereign of Fate actually trapped the long black spear&#x2019;s spearhead.</p><p>The Chief Sovereign of Destruction was awestruck at this. And then, he let out a resigned sigh. &#x201C;I still lose.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Wodred.&#x201D; The Chief Sovereign of Fate&#x2019;s eyes were flashing with a strange light, and he hurriedly asked, &#x201C;What is the name of this technique you came up with?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;This was borrowed from the supreme technique of the Four Divine Beasts. The name of it is &#x2018;Spacetime Paradox.&#x2019;&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Spacetime Paradox? An extremely powerful attack. After all these years, I finally felt the aura of death stretch towards me.&#x201D; The Chief Sovereign of Fate let out a sigh.</p><p>The Chief Sovereign of Destruction let out a forlorn chuckle. &#x201C;Enough, Orloff. I lost, I lost! This technique, Spacetime Paradox, is definitely the most powerful attack I have ever developed. It increased my power at least a thousandfold. And yet, this technique still is unable to overcome you. Haha&#x2026;&#x201D; The Chief Sovereign of Destruction&#x2019;s laugh contained some grief and resignation within it.</p><p>&#x201C;Wodred.&#x201D; The Chief Sovereign of Fate said solemnly, &#x201C;I can tell you clearly that this technique of yours was primarily focused on attacking the soul! But I, I have a soul-protecting Overgod artifact! Thus, this supreme attack of yours, Spacetime Paradox, is ineffective against me. Aside from a soul attack component, your Spacetime Paradox also impacts both space and time, but over the course of countless years, I have primarily focused my research on material aspects, such as body strengthening and material attacks. Despite that, I still had to use all my strength to be able to able to block your spear, despite that constrictive power.&#x201D;</p><p>The Chief Sovereign of Destruction let out a sigh.</p><p>He understood as well.</p><p>He immediately understood, as soon as he had developed Spacetime Paradox. The other two Chief Sovereigns definitely were no match for him now!</p><p>Given how Spacetime Paradox clashed against the soul, someone who did not possess a soul-protecting Overgod artifact would definitely not be able to resist it. But unfortunately, the Chief Sovereign of Fate just so happened to have one! The Chief Sovereign of Fate had completed the Overgod mission and selected a soul-protecting Overgod artifact. Many felt that he was foolish, that his choice was useless.</p><p>After all, how could other Chief Sovereigns possibly pose a threat to his soul?</p><p>But who would have imagined that at this point, it proved effective.</p><p>&#x201C;You should remember our agreement.&#x201D; The Chief Sovereign of Fate&#x2019;s gaze was hot.</p><p>The Chief Sovereign of Destruction looked at him, then let out a bitter laugh. &#x201C;Naturally, I will honor it.&#x201D;</p><p>The other ten Chief Sovereign level individuals who were watching this battle from far away, upon seeing the conclusion, were stupefied.</p><p>&#x201C;How can that be? Lord Orloff&#x2026;even under that sort of constriction, he was still able to block such a quick attack.&#x201D; The Chief Sovereign of Water couldn&#x2019;t believe it at all. Just now, the technique &#x2018;Spacetime Paradox&#x2019; had exerted such a powerful constrictive force on the surrounding area that even the distant Chief Sovereigns felt it.</p><p>&#x201C;Lord Orloff actually won.&#x201D;</p><p>The Chief Sovereigns were truly stunned.</p><p>&#x201C;Terrifying.&#x201D; Linley only said this single word to himself.</p><p>The Chief Sovereign of Life smiled. &#x201C;The combined attack of the Four Divine Beasts had an impact on space and time, but it was still primarily a soul attack! Orloff has a soul-protecting Overgod artifact, and so when this technique was applied to him, all it was able to do was bind him. But despite being bound, he was still able to block that spear.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;How useless.&#x201D;</p><p>The Chief Sovereign of Death couldn&#x2019;t help but curse softly.</p><p>Linley couldn&#x2019;t help but look towards the Chief Sovereign of Death. He had never seen this adorable, beautiful maiden be so irritated.</p><p>&#x201C;Linley.&#x201D; The Chief Sovereign of Death suddenly sent mentally to Linley.</p><p>&#x201C;What is it?&#x201D; Linley looked at the Chief Sovereign of Death, puzzled.</p><p>&#x201C;There is something which I hope you can promise me.&#x201D; The Chief Sovereign of Death sent solemnly.</p><p>&#x201C;Please speak.&#x201D; Linley said hurriedly, but in his heart, he still felt puzzled. The Chief Sovereign of Death, ask him for something?</p><p>The Chief Sovereign of Death sent, &#x201C;Remember this. No matter what&#x2026;the three of you from Yulan, no matter what, are not to give the blood essence of the Four Divine Beasts to Orloff!&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Eh?&#x201D; Linley was completely puzzled. &#x201C;Chief Sovereign, can you tell me why?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Ugh.&#x201D; The Chief Sovereign of Death let out a sigh. &#x201C;Linley. Do you know why, just now, Wodred switched his Overgod weapon for a Sovereign weapon?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;I truly don&#x2019;t.&#x201D; Linley had been puzzled earlier as to why the Overgod weapon had been swapped for a Sovereign artifact. Didn&#x2019;t that mean he was lowering his own attack power?</p><p>The Chief Sovereign of Death sent mentally, &#x201C;Actually, this time, after we four Chief Sovereigns of the Edicts rendered our verdict upon you, all of you left. At that time, the Chief Sovereign of Destruction, Wodred, suggested a competition with the Chief Sovereign of Fate. However, the Chief Sovereign of Fate didn&#x2019;t agree, because&#x2026;the Chief Sovereign of Fate disdains competitions.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Afterwards, the Chief Sovereign of Destruction mentioned the supreme technique that he had developed, based on the innate divine abilities of the Four Divine Beasts.&#x201D; The Chief Sovereign of Death sighed. &#x201C;At that time, we were all shocked. As for Orloff, that madman was intrigued. However, he could imagine the power of a supreme technique that was akin to the combined innate divine abilities of the Four Divine Beasts. And so that madman Orloff didn&#x2019;t feel confident either. Thus, they made an agreement.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;What agreement?&#x201D; Linley asked hurriedly.</p><p>&#x201C;The agreement was, once the Chief Sovereign of Destruction was prepared to release his supreme technique, he was only permitted to use his Sovereign weapon to attack. If the Chief Sovereign of Fate was unable to raise his hand to block the Sovereign weapon, that would be considered the Chief Sovereign of Fate having lost! If the Chief Sovereign of Fate was hit by the attack but still was able to block, then he would be considered the victor.&#x201D; The Chief Sovereign of Death said.</p><p>Linley understood as well.</p><p>The Chief Sovereign of Fate, by relying on his understanding of the Laws and his own power, was able to use his hand to block an Overgod weapon.</p><p>However, once he was struck by Spacetime Paradox, the Chief Sovereign of Fate&#x2019;s speed would drastically lessen. If he wasn&#x2019;t able to block the attack, then if the Chief Sovereign of Destruction was using his Overgod weapon, the Chief Sovereign of Fate would perish!</p><p>&#x201C;Thus, when using that technique, the Chief Sovereign of Destruction was not to use his Overgod weapon. The two were simply sparring, after all.&#x201D; The Chief Sovereign of Death shook her head and sighed. &#x201C;But they added a bet to their competition.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;What bet?&#x201D; Linley said, puzzled.</p><p>&#x201C;If the Chief Sovereign of Destruction won, the Chief Sovereign of Fate would have to explain the principles of his supreme technique to him. But if the Chief Sovereign of Fate won, then the Chief Sovereign of Destruction would also have to explain the principles of his supreme technique.&#x201D; The Chief Sovereign of Death let out a sigh.</p><p>&#x201C;But&#x2026;&#x201D; Linley was rather stunned.</p><p>&#x201C;At first, Wodred was unwilling to accept these stakes, but Orloff clearly wanted to know the principles of the supreme technique very much, and so he said that if Wodred didn&#x2019;t accept these stakes, he wouldn&#x2019;t agree to the duel.&#x201D; The Chief Sovereign of Death sighed. &#x201C;It was Wodred who wanted to challenge Orloff, after all. In addition, he was very confident in himself, and so he agreed to the bet.&#x201D;</p><p>Linley nodded slightly.</p><p>&#x201C;Linley, I know&#x2026;even if one understands all the principles of an attack akin to an innate divine ability, actually executing it&#x2026;without the blood essence, the power would be much, much lower, even if the attack could be executed.&#x201D; The Chief Sovereign of Death looked at Linley.  &#x201C;Thus, Linley, the three of you in the Yulan branch are not to give Orloff the blood essence of the Four Divine Beasts, no matter what.&#x201D;</p><p>The Chief Sovereign of Death spoke quite bluntly.</p><p>&#x201C;I understand. I won&#x2019;t give him the blood essence of the Four Divine Beasts.&#x201D; Linley nodded.</p><p>&#x201C;Alas. Actually, by giving you these instructions&#x2026;&#x201D; The Chief Sovereign of Death stared far into the void, at the Chief Sovereigns of Destruction and Fate. &#x201C;Ever since he came up with that technique, the Chief Sovereign of Destruction has surpassed me and Wawaya. The balance of power between us four Chief Sovereigns of the Edicts is gone.&#x201D;</p><p>Linley nodded.</p><p>The Chief Sovereign of Fate had a protective Overgod artifact, but the Chief Sovereigns of Death and Life did not. Who could possibly resist the Chief Sovereign of Destruction&#x2019;s &#x2018;Spacetime Paradox&#x2019; attack?</p><p>&#x201C;This&#x2026;&#x201D; Linley couldn&#x2019;t help but look towards the Chief Sovereign of Death.</p><p>&#x201C;Wodred and Orloff are able to counter each other; they shouldn&#x2019;t go so berserk as to act against me and Wawaya.&#x201D; The Chief Sovereign of Death sent with a laugh. &#x201C;It is much like how we four Chief Sovereigns of the Edicts wouldn&#x2019;t go act against the Chief Sovereigns of the Laws. Since we are already at the peak, if we kill everyone else at our level, won&#x2019;t we feel lonely?&#x201D;</p><p>The words of the Chief Sovereign of Death were actually meant to comfort herself.</p><p>&#x201C;They can research. Why can&#x2019;t you, Chief Sovereign?&#x201D; Linley said consolingly.</p><p>&#x201C;I don&#x2019;t have the patience.&#x201D; The Chief Sovereign of Death let out a soft laugh. &#x201C;If we are to actually fight though, so long as Wawaya and I join forces, it&#x2019;s hard to say who will be the one to perish!&#x201D;</p><p>At this moment, the Chief Sovereign of Death and the Chief Sovereign of Life exchanged a glance, as though discussing something.</p><p>Within the void, the Chief Sovereign of Destruction and the Chief Sovereign of Fate were currently chatting through divine sense.</p><p>&#x201C;Haha, how marvelous.&#x201D; The Chief Sovereign of Fate&#x2019;s eyes were filled with strange colors. &#x201C;This &#x2018;Spacetime Paradox&#x2019; of yours truly is extremely miraculous. Although the power is inferior to the combined innate divine ability of the Four Divine Beasts, it just so happens to avoid the problem of the differences in the souls. Wodred, I truly admire you.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Hmph.&#x201D; The Chief Sovereign of Destruction had an ugly look on his face.</p><p>&#x201C;Unfortunately, this technique can only be unleashed when relying on the lineage of the Four Divine Beasts.&#x201D; The Chief Sovereign of Fate let out a sigh. After speaking, he couldn&#x2019;t help but turn to look at &#x2018;Linley&#x2019;, amongst the other ten in the distance.</p><p>The battle was over. The twelve Chief Sovereign level experts all departed from chaotic space and returned to the nearby Divine Wind Plane.</p><p>The cool, clear sea wind blew. There, above the sea, those twelve figures separated as well.</p><p>&#x201C;Swish!&#x201D; Not far away, atop the sea, a metallic lifeform flew past. The Deities within the metallic lifeform glanced towards the twelve in the distance. They didn&#x2019;t pay any attention. How could they have imagined that those twelve floating figures were twelve Chief Sovereign level experts?</p><p>&#x201C;Orloff, last time, you said you were going all out. This time, you also said that you went all out.&#x201D; The beautiful, red-haired maiden looked at Orloff and let out a snort. &#x201C;Are you hiding part of your power?&#x201D;</p><p>Orloff, that old fellow, let out a resigned chuckle. &#x201C;This time, I really did go all out. You have no idea&#x2026;when Wodred used that technique just now, I was badly frightened. That soul attack is so strong that if it wasn&#x2019;t for my soul-protecting Overgod artifact, I would truly have been finished. Even the distortion on spacetime was enough to make it so that I could just barely deflect that spear.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Hmph. Keep acting smug.&#x201D; The beautiful, red-haired maiden let out a snort.</p><p>Linley and the others could only watch quietly.</p><p>After all, the four Chief Sovereigns of the Edicts were on good terms with each other. It wouldn&#x2019;t be appropriate for others to interrupt.</p><p>&#x201C;Linley.&#x201D; The Chief Sovereign of Fate, Orloff, suddenly turned to look towards Linley. Chuckling, he said, &#x201C;Are you free? If you are, how about you come pay a visit to my &#x2018;Orloff Gardens&#x2019; in the Celestial Realm? What do you say?&#x201D;</p><p>The Orloff Gardens, in the Celestial Realm, was viewed as the most sacred of areas.</p><p>This was a massive garden that floated extremely high in the air, and it was also the residence of the Chief Sovereign of Fate. Even ordinary Sovereigns, without Orloff&#x2019;s permission, wouldn&#x2019;t dare to enter the Orloff Gardens at all. Normally, the Chief Sovereign of Fate, Orloff, spent all his time in the gardens in research.</p><p>&#x201C;Linley, remember what you promised me.&#x201D; The Chief Sovereign of Death sent to him. Not just her; even the Chief Sovereigns of Destruction and Life hurriedly looked towards Linley.</p><p>As these three saw it, Orloff&#x2019;s defense could be described as unbreakable.</p><p>If Orloff was to then learn the &#x2018;Spacetime Paradox&#x2019; technique, who could be a match for him? Although they all knew that, given Orloff&#x2019;s nature, he wouldn&#x2019;t kill them, but&#x2026;they still didn&#x2019;t want for Orloff&#x2019;s power to rise too much.</p><p>Linley laughed awkwardly, then said helplessly, &#x201C;Lord Orloff, I truly am sorry. I have something important to do first.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Haha, no rush, no rush. When you have time, you can come find me later.&#x201D; Orloff smiled. &#x201C;Alright, everyone. I&#x2019;ll go back now.&#x201D;</p><p>The Chief Sovereign of Fate, Orloff, chortled, then left on his own.</p><p>&#x201C;Linley.&#x201D; The Chief Sovereign of Light, Augusta, who had been silent this entire time, beamed as he looked towards Linley. He sent mentally, &#x201C;Weren&#x2019;t you going to go to my Divine Light Plane?&#x201D;</p><p></p><hr><p></p>
