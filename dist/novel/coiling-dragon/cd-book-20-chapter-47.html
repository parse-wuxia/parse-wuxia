<p><b><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> Book 20, The Crown&#x2019;s Riddle &#x2013; Chapter 47, Battle</span></b></p><p>&#x201C;The Chief Sovereign of Light?&#x201D; Linley and Bebe exchanged glances. Their hearts clenched as they then turned towards Beirut.</p><p>Beirut was leading Linley and Bebe at high speed towards the Yulan Plane, while at the same time chatting with the Chief Sovereign of Light through divine sense. &#x201C;Haha, Augusta, as I see it, you should go back to your Divine Light Plane. Chasing after me is a complete waste of time. Afterwards, you&#x2019;ll have to go back with nothing to show for your efforts.&#x201D;</p><p>Beirut&#x2019;s mocking laughter was hidden within his words.</p><p>&#x201C;Hmph. It&#x2019;s too early to say such a thing. You still have quite a long distance between you and the Yulan Plane. You had best hope that you can enter the Yulan Plane first. If I catch you, then you and those two people with you will both definitely die!&#x201D; The Chief Sovereign of Light&#x2019;s face was quite sinister. The distance between him and Beirut in chaotic space was quite significant, and he was currently advancing at an astonishing speed. In terms of speed, he was indeed much faster than Beirut.</p><p>Unfortunately&#x2026;</p><p>The Higher Planes and Divine Planes were very far away from the material planes to begin with. The vast majority of material planes, however, were located in the same region. The distance between the Okerlund Plane and the Yulan Plane, by comparison, was tens of times less than the distance between the Okerlund Plane and the Divine Light Plane.</p><p>&#x201C;Haha, then keep chasing!&#x201D; Beirut didn&#x2019;t say anything else.</p><p>Within the vast, endless reaches of chaotic space, one side was hurrying forward while the other side was chasing.</p><p>The Infernal Realm.</p><p>&#x201C;Linley actually entered chaotic space?&#x201D; A figure covered completely by a black aura mused in a low voice, then let out a laugh. &#x201C;It seems Linley actually isn&#x2019;t willing to give up the Overgod talisman or to give it to any other Sovereigns. That Beirut which stands behind him&#x2026;he really has quite some courage.&#x201D;</p><p>The Infernal Realm. The Redbud Continent. The Amethyst Mountains.</p><p>&#x201C;Aside from Beirut, there can&#x2019;t be anyone else.&#x201D; The Redbud Sovereign could easily judge what had happened as well. &#x201C;Given how cautious Beirut is, there shouldn&#x2019;t be any problems.&#x201D;</p><p>The news that Linley had torn open a spatial rift, then entered it alongside Bebe, had been quickly reported back to the various Sovereigns by the Highgods. It wasn&#x2019;t just the Chief Sovereigns of the various Laws and Edicts; the other Sovereigns had also sent people to watch over Linley&#x2019;s movements.</p><p>The Divine Wind Plane.</p><p>&#x201C;Hmph, from the Yulan Plane to the Okerlund Plane? Excellent. My homeland, the Dylan [Di&#x2019;lun] Plane, happens to be between them.&#x201D; A hawk-nosed, silver-haired man, upon receiving this news, immediately began to fly at high speed towards the teleportation array of the Divine Wind Plane. Soon, he reached the array.</p><p>&#x201C;Dylan Plane.&#x201D; The Sovereign of Wind, Teresia, said calmly as he showed his Sovereign medallion.</p><p>&#x201C;Yes.&#x201D;</p><p>The soldiers didn&#x2019;t dare act sluggishly. They immediately activated the teleportation array, and light began to flash and flicker. In the blink of an eye, the Sovereign of Wind, Teresia, arrived at his homeland&#x2026;the material plane known as the Dylan Plane. He immediately tore open a spatial rift, then entered chaotic space. He immediately spread out his divine sense.</p><p>A hint of a smile played at the corners of Teresia&#x2019;s lips. &#x201C;Beirut, what a rare occasion. You actually left the Yulan Plane!&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;You actually left the Yulan Plane!&#x201D; This voice rang out in Beirut&#x2019;s mind, and Beirut&#x2019;s face couldn&#x2019;t help but sink.</p><p>&#x201C;Grandpa Beirut, what is it?&#x201D; Bebe noticed that the look on Beirut&#x2019;s face was off, and he hurriedly asked.</p><p>Linley looked towards Beirut in concern as well. Beirut had an ugly look on his face. &#x201C;Linley, Bebe, the situation is quite bad. That Teresia is quite close to us, and is in the way between us and home. Given his speed, he will probably encounter us shortly.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Teresia?&#x201D; Linley and Bebe both looked at each other.</p><p>The Sovereign of Wind, Teresia, was someone who Linley knew. When the Lord Prefect of Skymount Prefecture, Molde, had released the Overgod mission information, Teresia had threatened Linley to try and force him to hand over the nine soul pearls. If it hadn&#x2019;t been for the Bloodridge Sovereign&#x2019;s intervention, Linley could very well have been killed by Teresia back then.</p><p>&#x201C;Grandpa, that&#x2019;s not a problem, right?&#x201D; Bebe said, worried.</p><p>&#x201C;This Teresia is a Lesser Sovereign of Wind. I, too, am a Lesser Sovereign of Wind. However&#x2026;in the Laws, he has reached the level of Paragon. Thus, he is quite troublesome.&#x201D; Although Beirut was concerned, he still led Linley and Bebe in a constant advance.</p><p>Linley frowned.</p><p>They were both Lesser Sovereigns, but one was a Paragon in the laws. By the looks of it, Beirut wasn&#x2019;t a match for him.</p><p>&#x201C;Fighting with Teresia isn&#x2019;t a problem. The main problem is&#x2026;once he ties us down, if the Chief Sovereign of Light makes it over, we will be finished.&#x201D; Beirut said, rather worried.</p><p>&#x201C;Right. If Grandpa starts to fight with Teresia, there&#x2019;s no way he will be able to move forward.&#x201D; Bebe was so frantic that his face turned red. &#x201C;Once the Chief Sovereign of Light catches us, then&#x2026;&#x201D;</p><p>Linley looked at Beirut.</p><p>Neither he nor Bebe were able to help. They had to rely on Beirut.</p><p>&#x201C;Teresia! Why do you want this Overgod talisman? The red caltrop diamond is&#xA0;just one of the three talismans. There isn&#x2019;t much benefit to you for acquiring it. Can it be that you, a Lesser Sovereign, also dream of completing the mission and acquiring an Overgod artifact?&#x201D; Beirut sent.</p><p>&#x201C;If you don&#x2019;t want me to bar you, that&#x2019;s fine. Beirut, agree to the request I made last time.&#x201D; Teresia sent.</p><p>&#x201C;In your dreams.&#x201D; Beirut couldn&#x2019;t help but feel enraged.</p><p>&#x201C;Haha, if you refuse, then I&#x2019;ll stop you. Soon, I imagine, you and I will encounter each other.&#x201D; Teresia laughed smugly.</p><p>Beirut suppressed his range. &#x201C;Speak. Aside from that, what else do you want in exchange for not stopping us.&#x201D;</p><p>Teresia was a Paragon and a Lesser Sovereign of Wind. In terms of speed, he was slightly faster than even Beirut.</p><p>If Beirut wanted to bypass Teresia to return to the Yulan Plane, first of all, he would have to take a very roundabout path that was too distant. And secondly, Teresia could choose to simply travel straight to the Yulan Plane and wait for Beirut there. No matter what&#x2026;there was no way to avoid Teresia.</p><p>&#x201C;I&#x2019;ve already told you what I want. Fine, if you aren&#x2019;t able to satisfy that request, this is also acceptable&#x2026;hand over the red caltrop diamond, and I&#x2019;ll let you pass.&#x201D; Teresia sent.</p><p>Hand over the red caltrop diamond? Wouldn&#x2019;t that have made this journey pointless?</p><p>&#x201C;Teresia, don&#x2019;t force me too far.&#x201D; Beirut sent furiously.</p><p>&#x201C;Force you too far? And what will you do if I do force you too far? All you ever do is hide in the Yulan Plane, never daring to come out.&#x201D; Teresia said arrogantly.</p><p>&#x201C;Hmph. Then why don&#x2019;t the two of us have a head-on competition.&#x201D; Beirut sent furiously.</p><p>&#x201C;Haha. So Beirut, who has the cowardice of a mouse, actually dares to speak such bold words! How rare, how rare indeed!&#x201D; Teresia laughed mentally towards Beirut.</p><p>Beirut let out a cold snort, no longer saying anything.</p><p>Linley didn&#x2019;t know what Beirut and Teresia were saying to each other, but he was able to guess what had happened, based on the look on Beirut&#x2019;s face. &#x201C;It seems Lord Beirut and Teresia weren&#x2019;t able to come to an agreement. This&#x2026;is going to be trouble.&#x201D; Linley and Bebe had no choice but to wait and watch what was going to happen.</p><p>Currents of multicolored chaotic energy swirled about, with spatial rifts occasionally appearing.</p><p>Beirut continued to lead Linley and Bebe forward. Moments later.</p><p>&#x201C;Grandpa, Teresia.&#x201D; Bebe called out in surprise.</p><p>Linley stared hard into the distance. That aura of green light. That tall figure with long, flowing silver hair. Those narrow, slitted eyes that seemed to contain a knife-like gaze. That upwards-crooking cold smile as he looked at Beirut and the other two.</p><p>&#x201C;Beirut.&#x201D; Teresia spoke out.</p><p>&#x201C;Teresia. You&#x2019;d best leave right now. Later, you won&#x2019;t be able to.&#x201D; Beirut&#x2019;s gaze was cold.</p><p>&#x201C;Hmph.&#x201D; Teresia&#x2019;s face suddenly changed. &#x201C;You actually notified a helper.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Of course. As soon as I noticed you, I made the notification.&#x201D; Beirut said coldly.</p><p>&#x201C;Just a Lesser Sovereign of Fire. Do you think I am afraid?&#x201D; Teresia laughed disdainfully. &#x201C;There are less than ten Sovereigns who have become Paragons. There aren&#x2019;t many Lesser Sovereigns who are able to beat me. You, at least, aren&#x2019;t one of them. I imagine your helper won&#x2019;t be a match for me either.&#x201D;</p><p>Linley rather frantically sent to Beirut, &#x201C;Lord Beirut, Teresia is clearly delaying. The longer he delays, the worse it will be for us.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;I know.&#x201D; Beirut winked towards Linley. &#x201C;Don&#x2019;t worry, Linley. Everything is as I expected.&#x201D;</p><p>Seeing how calm Beirut was, Linley couldn&#x2019;t help but be influenced and feel more confident.</p><p>&#x201C;Linley, last time, the Bloodridge Sovereign let you escape. This time, you will find it hard to.&#x201D; Teresia waved his hand, and a cold, sharp light flashed as an enormous, thin sickle appeared. The aura that emanated from the sickle caused the surrounding chaotic space to tremble.</p><p>His body flashed. Then, like a dragon taking flight, he pierced through the kilometers separating them and chopped down towards Beirut, the sickle seeming to contain the power to shatter the heavens.</p><p>&#x201C;Linley, take Bebe and make haste towards the direction of the Yulan Plane. I&#x2019;ll be there shortly.&#x201D; Beirut sent frantically.</p><p>&#x201C;Yes.&#x201D; Linley didn&#x2019;t hesitate at all.</p><p>A long black staff suddenly appeared in Beirut&#x2019;s hands. The long staff suddenly expanded to a length of a hundred meters long and many meters wide, and it viciously smashed over.</p><p>&#x201C;Clang!&#x201D;</p><p>The terrifying scimitar tore through chaotic space and smashed directly against the long black staff, but was only able to make it tremble slightly.</p><p>&#x201C;Bebe, let&#x2019;s go.&#x201D; Linley grabbed Bebe and immediately worked hard to resist the flows of chaotic space and make haste towards the Yulan Plane.</p><p>&#x201C;Boss, Grandpa will be fine, right?&#x201D; Bebe said, worried.</p><p>&#x201C;If we stay behind, we will negatively impact your Grandpa Beirut.&#x201D; Linley understood the situation quite well. &#x201C;If Teresia were to attack us in order to threaten Beirut, that would be troublesome. Let&#x2019;s go now. After Beirut&#x2019;s battle concludes, he will catch up to us.&#x201D; Although he said this, in his heart, Linley still felt worried.</p><p>If Beirut and Teresia fought for too long, and the Chief Sovereign of Light caught up to them, what was to be done?</p><p>&#x201C;Rumble&#x2026;&#x201D;</p><p>A terrifying surge of wind-type energy suddenly swept over, actually slamming against the body of Linley, who had flown more than a thousand kilometers away.</p><p>&#x201C;Swoosh!&#x201D; Linley actually borrowed the momentum from that surge and fled even more quickly!</p><p>&#x201C;It really is a battle between Sovereigns. Even remnant energy ripples from a thousand kilometers away are far more powerful than the strikes of Paragons.&#x201D; Linley was secretly shocked. He continued to hold Bebe as he frantically charged forward.</p><p>Linley and Bebe constantly advanced forward. A few moments later.</p><p>&#x201C;Boss, there is someone else up ahead.&#x201D; Bebe said, stunned.</p><p>&#x201C;Another Sovereign!&#x201D; Linley&#x2019;s face instantly turned ashen!</p><p>Beirut was already blocking Teresia from behind; if another Sovereign came, how could he or Bebe resist?</p><p>A fiery light flashed over from far away. Moments later, it arrived by Linley and Bebe&#x2019;s sides. Linley and Bebe looked cautiously at this person, and as he slowed down, they were able to clearly see who it was.</p><p>&#x201C;This is&#x2026;&#x201D; Linley and Bebe were both stunned.</p><p>Long black hair. A long white robe. Scarlet, crimson eyebrows!</p><p>&#x201C;Bluefire.&#x201D; Linley called out in shock.</p><p>They would never have imagined that the newcomer was Bluefire! And, judging from the aura around Bluefire&#x2019;s body, he was using fire-type Sovereign power&#x2026;clearly, Bluefire was a Sovereign of Fire!!!</p><p>&#x201C;Mr. Leylin, you&#x2026;&#x201D; Linley was completely flummoxed.</p><p>&#x201C;Mr. Leylin, how did you become a Sovereign?&#x201D; Bebe called out in surprise. Only Sovereigns could possibly move through chaotic space at such speed.</p><p>&#x201C;Bluefire, you came.&#x201D; A green blur hurried over from behind at high speed.</p><p>&#x201C;Beirut.&#x201D; Bluefire smiled as he looked at him. &#x201C;You lead Linley and Bebe and hurry back to the Yulan Plane. I&#x2019;ll help you ward off this Teresia. I&#x2019;m more than enough to deal with him.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;While fighting with him, move towards the direction of the Yulan Plane. No matter what, don&#x2019;t let the Chief Sovereign of Light catch you.&#x201D; Beirut instructed.</p><p>&#x201C;Don&#x2019;t worry. In terms of speed, I&#x2019;m a bit faster than you.&#x201D; Bluefire smiled.</p><p>&#x201C;Linley, Bebe, let&#x2019;s go.&#x201D; Beirut didn&#x2019;t waste any words, immediately leading Linley and Bebe once more towards the Yulan Plane.</p><p>As for Bluefire, his entire body covered with a blazing aura, he very confidently stood there in the middle of chaotic smile, smiling as he looked at the rather haggard-looking Teresia who was in hot pursuit. &#x201C;Teresia, you want to seize the red caltrop diamond and offer it to the Chief Sovereign of Light? Give up. You have no chance.&#x201D;</p><p></p><hr><p></p>
