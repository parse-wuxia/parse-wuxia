<p><b><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> Book 10, Baruch &#x2013; Chapter 10, Forget It! </span></b></p><p>Emperor Rande smiled towards Delia. &#x201C;Delia, We haven&#x2019;t seen you in quite some time. Ever since you&#x2019;ve returned from the O&#x2019;Brien Empire, you haven&#x2019;t gone to the imperial palace.&#x201D; Emperor Rande was roughly the same age as Delia and they were on quite good terms.</p><p>&#x201C;Teacher is quite strict. I have to train hard and study my magic.&#x201D; Delia pretended to be resigned.</p><p>Emperor Rande laughed.</p><p>Right at this time, the Worldbear, Hatton, said to Emperor Rande, &#x201C;Hey, blue-hair. My master says you can come in.&#x201D; The Worldbear wasn&#x2019;t the slightest bit courteous in his words, but Emperor Rande didn&#x2019;t mind in the slightest. &#x201C;Big Yellow, even if you don&#x2019;t address Us as &#x2018;your Imperial Majesty&#x2019;, you should at least call Us &#x2018;Rande&#x2019;. That way, We would at least save a bit of face.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Is &#x2018;Big Yellow&#x2019; a name which the likes of you can call about?&#x201D; The Worldbear turned his big furry head away, seemingly very disdainful.</p><p>Rande chuckled, then after saying a few words to George and Delia, he entered the inner room. Right now, only George and Delia were left inside the courtyard. Delia had a very good impression of George&#x2026;because George was Linley&#x2019;s good friend.</p><p>Second Bro, &#x2018;George&#x2019;. He was the most rational and most reliable of the four bros.</p><p>He had a very good temper and rarely grew angry at others. He had extremely good relationships with people.</p><p>But Delia knew very well that George was also an extremely formidable person. At such a young age, he had become one of the Grand Secretaries of the Yulan Empire. It must be understood, the world of officials and bureaucracies was a dark, sinister place. For someone to reach such a powerful, influential official position and even become a Grand Secretary meant that in secret, George surely used quite a few tricks as well.</p><p>As to who was most vicious amongst the four bros, it was George, amiable, good-natured George, who had become the most vicious.</p><p>&#x201C;George, sit.&#x201D; Delia laughed.</p><p>George smiled and sat down. &#x201C;Delia, last year, you should&#x2019;ve seen Third Bro in the O&#x2019;Brien Empire. Oh, by Third Bro I mean Linley.&#x201D; In his heart, George longed for his dear bros, but as a high level member of the Yulan Empire, he simply didn&#x2019;t have the opportunity to visit the O&#x2019;Brien Empire.</p><p>&#x201C;I know.&#x201D; Delia&#x2019;s smile was very bright. &#x201C;Linley&#x2019;s often thinking about you as well.&#x201D;</p><p>George felt warm in his heart.</p><p>After separating from Linley, over ten years had passed. George was now twenty nine years old, nearly a man in his thirties. He even had two children. Those crazy childhood days were beautiful recollections.</p><p>The ten years he had spent in bureaucracy had caused George to become more and more mature and more and more crafty. But the more mature he became, the fewer the number of people he truly trusted in the Yulan Empire.</p><p>&#x201C;I feel very proud that Third Bro was able to reach his current accomplishments.&#x201D; George sighed emotionally. &#x201C;In the O&#x2019;Brien Empire, most likely no one would dare to offend him. In this entire world, only upon reaching the pinnacle of power can one be confident.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Linley has gone to the Anarchic Lands.&#x201D; Delia said.</p><p>&#x201C;The Anarchic Lands?&#x201D;</p><p>George frowned. He remembered the enmity between Linley and the Radiant Church which he had found out about in Hess City. In particular, with those high level people of the Radiant Church. George knew very well how powerful the Radiant Church and the Cult of Shadows were in the Anarchic Lands. &#x201C;Given Third Bro&#x2019;s temperament, he definitely wouldn&#x2019;t be interested in just taking over territory. That means&#x2026;&#x201D;</p><p>George looked at Delia and whispered, &#x201C;Third Bro is about to begin his battle against the Radiant Church?&#x201D;</p><p>Delia felt a hint of shock in her heart. George truly was formidable.</p><p>&#x201C;Right.&#x201D; Delia nodded. Linley had told her about this long ago.</p><p>George began to worry. He knew what sort of temper Linley had. In the past, for the sake of vengeance, Linley was willing to give up everything. If it had been him, George, he definitely would&#x2019;ve continued to secretly endure until he reached the point where he had absolute certainty of victory. Then, he would make his move.</p><p>&#x201C;Is Third Bro confident of victory?&#x201D; George looked at Delia. &#x201C;The Radiant Church isn&#x2019;t as simple as it would appear to be.&#x201D;</p><p>Delia laughed as she looked at George. &#x201C;George, Linley isn&#x2019;t as simple as you think he is either.&#x201D;</p><p>George laughed. Indeed. Despite being a genius, George never imagined that after they separated, Linley would become so powerful that he could fight Haydson to a virtual standstill. In particular, that Shadowmouse, Bebe&#x2026;George felt quite speechless. &#x201C;That little rascal, Bebe. He&#x2019;s so monstrously powerful. What a freak.&#x201D;</p><p>After a while later, Emperor Rande came out.</p><p>&#x201C;George, let&#x2019;s go.&#x201D; Emperor Rande said to George, and George immediately stood up. Emperor Rande smiled towards Delia, who was sending him off. &#x201C;Delia, if you are free, you can come to the imperial palace for a stroll. The Third Princess has been missing you.&#x201D;</p><p>Delia laughed. &#x201C;I definitely will go.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Then there&#x2019;s no need for you to send me off.&#x201D; Emperor Rande laughed, then left alongside George.</p><p>&#x2026;..</p><p>The imperial palace. Emperor Rande&#x2019;s study. There were only three people present; Emperor Rande, his personal palace attendant, and the leader of the Leon clan.</p><p>&#x201C;Dylla.&#x201D; Emperor Rande put down the quill in his hand, raising his head to smile towards Dylla Leon. &#x201C;Today, We have summoned you for the sake of your daughter, Delia.&#x201D;</p><p>Dylla Leon looked at Emperor Rande. &#x201C;Your Imperial Majesty, what do you mean?&#x201D;</p><p>Emperor Rande smiled. &#x201C;As We recall, your daughter is yet unwed.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Right.&#x201D; Dylla Leon nodded.</p><p>Had Emperor Rande taken a fancy to his daughter?</p><p>Emperor Rande nodded. &#x201C;That&#x2019;s right. In honesty&#x2026;We rather like Delia. How about this. Help Us say a few words to Delia on Our behalf, and see if Delia is willing to marry Us. But of course&#x2026;you have to let her make her own decision.&#x201D;</p><p>Dylla Leon said respectfully, &#x201C;Your Imperial Majesty, don&#x2019;t worry. Your servant shall definitely go ask Delia.&#x201D;</p><p>Emperor Rande nodded and smiled as he looked at Dylla Leon. &#x201C;Dylla, you should understand that when We were but a prince, We had to have children before We could assume the throne. We don&#x2019;t have much affection towards that woman. In terms of lineage as well as character, Delia is far superior to her. If Delia was willing to marry Us&#x2026;We promise that Delia can become the Empress.&#x201D;</p><p>Dylla Leon&#x2019;s heart trembled.</p><p>Empress?</p><p>If his daughter were to become an ordinary concubine, there would be no need for the mighty Leon clan to agree. But the Empress&#x2026;now that was a different situation.</p><p>Dylla Leon knew quite well that this Emperor Rande was an extremely upright and extremely bold person. If he said Delia would become Empress, he would definitely make that happen.</p><p>&#x201C;Alright, you can go now.&#x201D; Emperor Rande said with a faint laugh.</p><p>&#x201C;Yes, your Imperial Majesty.&#x201D; Right now, Dylla Leon&#x2019;s heart was still in a state of excitement.</p><p>Dylla Leon immediately sent someone to summon Delia home. Delia actually didn&#x2019;t wish to go home. Each time she did, her parents would try to persuade her on the subject of marriage. Although Delia insisted that Linley was now outside the O&#x2019;Brien Empire and that her marriage to Linley wouldn&#x2019;t pose any problems to the clan, it seemed as though her parents didn&#x2019;t really like Linley.</p><p>In Dylla&#x2019;s eyes, Linley&#x2019;s younger brother had wed the Seventh Imperial Princess, Nina, after all. There was an indisputable relationship between Linley and the O&#x2019;Brien Empire.</p><p>&#x2026;..</p><p>&#x201C;What?&#x201D; Delia immediately rose to her feet, staring at her parents in astonishment.</p><p>Her mother hurriedly said, &#x201C;Delia, his Imperial Majesty&#x2019;s age is close to yours, and he is one of the boldest, most competent Emperors in the history of the Yulan Empire. You are on good terms with him as well. If you were to marry his Imperial Majesty&#x2026;it would be wonderful for both you and the clan.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;It would be wonderful for the clan, but how would it be wonderful for me?&#x201D; Delia couldn&#x2019;t help but be furious.</p><p>She hadn&#x2019;t thought that the reason her parents had summoned her back so urgently was to discuss this with her.</p><p>&#x201C;Delia, can it be that his Imperial Majesty isn&#x2019;t talented enough? Do you dislike him?&#x201D; Dylla Leon hurriedly said.</p><p>Delia said angrily, &#x201C;Father, what does his Imperial Majesty&#x2019;s talent have to do with me? No, I don&#x2019;t dislike him. But there&#x2019;s many people I don&#x2019;t dislike. Does this mean I have to marry them all? Marrying someone has nothing to do with whether or not I &#x2018;don&#x2019;t dislike them&#x2019;, understood?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Delia, his Imperial Majesty&#x2019;s feelings for you are genuine. He said that so long as you marry him, in the future, you would definitely become the Empress.&#x201D; Dylla said hurriedly.</p><p>&#x201C;Then what about the current Empress?&#x201D; Delia frowned.</p><p>Dylla Leon laughed calmly, &#x201C;That Empress was just someone the Emperor married when he was only a prince. She isn&#x2019;t very capable, and she was born to a common noble clan. There have been many people unhappy that she became Empress. It will be easy for his Imperial Majesty to remove her.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Hrmph!&#x201D;</p><p>Standing, Delia stared at her father. &#x201C;Father, perhaps to you, the position of Empress is very important, but to me, it isn&#x2019;t worth a fart.&#x201D; The furious Delia began to spout obscenities.</p><p>Dylla Leon was so angry that he slapped the desk and stood up as well. &#x201C;Delia, how can you say such things?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Father.&#x201D; Delia stared at her father. &#x201C;Don&#x2019;t try and put on a brave show in front of your daughter. Let me make it clear for you today&#x2026;with regards to his Imperial Majesty, you can forget it! Even if I die, I won&#x2019;t marry him. I won&#x2019;t marry anyone aside from Linley.&#x201D;</p><p>Dylla Leon stared disbelievingly at his daughter. His daughter actually dared to speak to him in such a manner?</p><p>&#x201C;I&#x2019;m sorry, father.&#x201D; Delia took a deep breath.</p><p>&#x201C;Cough&#x2026;cough&#x2026;&#x201D; The furious Dylla Leon began to cough. Dylla&#x2019;s mother immediately went to assist him, but Dylla stared angrily at Delia. &#x201C;Delia, you are no longer a child. Don&#x2019;t be so rash and immature. Enough. Go back and think it over.&#x201D;</p><p>Delia glanced at her red-faced, coughing father, then silently turned her head and left.</p><p>&#x201C;What happened to my parents?&#x201D; Delia could still remember how when she was a child, her father and mother had treated her like a precious treasure. Whatever she wanted done, her father would do. She had even ridden on her father&#x2019;s back like a horse.</p><p>Her childhood memories were so beautiful, and her parents were so perfect.</p><p>But now&#x2026;</p><p>Delia cared about her family. Her parents, her big brother, her grandmother, her other relatives&#x2026;Delia had always hoped that she would be able to be together with Linley, while maintaining the relationship with her clan.</p><p>&#x201C;I&#x2019;ll wait a bit longer. I&#x2019;ll wait for Linley to found his Duchy. By then, father&#x2019;s attitude would change.&#x201D; Delia chose to continue to endure.</p><p>&#x2026;..</p><p>In the mysterious village. On the wide expanse of grass in front of the cave estate. Desri, Hayward, Miller, Pennslyn, and the others were seated around a stone table, drinking wine while watching Linley and Higginson spar. As for Reynolds and Monica, they were at the side of the grassy area.</p><p>&#x201C;Monica, were you telling the truth in the past when you described your mother?&#x201D; Staring at the distant Pennslyn, Reynolds then looked at Monica in puzzlement.</p><p>Monica didn&#x2019;t know what to say either.</p><p>In the past, her mother was always rather cold and distant. It must be understood&#x2026;her mother came from the Frost Goddess Shrine. That sort of cold arrogance was bred in the bones. But these past few days, Pennslyn had treated Linley and Reynolds unbelievably well.</p><p>Reynolds had even begun to suspect if Monica had lied about her.</p><p>&#x201C;I don&#x2019;t get it either.&#x201D; Monica was truly speechless.</p><p>At this moment, Linley was wielding his adamantine heavy sword, while Higginson was wielding a silver, blurred longsword. The two were sparring, and Linley had begun to truly use his &#x2018;Profound Truths of the Earth&#x2019;. Although he hadn&#x2019;t gone full force, it was still enough to cause Higginson to sigh with surprise.</p><p>&#x201C;Bizarre, bizarre.&#x201D; Higginson sighed in praise. &#x201C;I&#x2019;ve never seen such a bizarre attack.&#x201D;</p><p>Linley stared helplessly at Higginson as well. Dealing with an expert of the Laws of Light truly was a pain. This was because once a person reached a certain level in the Laws of Light, his self-healing abilities would become extremely terrifying. Even broken arms would self-repair in a short period of time.</p><p>&#x201C;Linley, at this time, you should take a look at my ultimate attack.&#x201D; Higginson smiled.</p><p>Linley was startled. Up till now, Higginson had demonstrated a speed that was even faster than that of Olivier&#x2019;s. But he had been just playing around?</p><p>&#x201C;The name of this sword technique is &#x2018;Illusionary Void Sword&#x2019;.&#x201D; Wielding that silver longsword, Higginson suddenly transformed into a line of white light, appearing before Linley in the blink of an eye. A layer of azurish-black energy was swirling around Linley, and his adamantine heavy sword was at the ready as well.</p><p>Linley paid careful attention to the sword.</p><p>Why was it called &#x2018;Illusionary Void Sword&#x2019;?</p><p>&#x201C;Rumble&#x2026;&#x201D; The space itself in the surrounding area began to shudder and ripple. The silver longsword clearly appeared before Linley&#x2019;s eyes, but the strange thing was, Linley felt as though the longsword had transformed into multiple layers, and the nearby space had transformed into multiple layers as well. It was as though space itself had turned chaotic.</p><p>&#x201C;You lose.&#x201D;</p><p>Before Linley even had the chance to react, that sword came to a halt in front of Linley&#x2019;s eyes. Linley hadn&#x2019;t even had the chance to resist or to block.</p><p>&#x201C;This&#x2026;&#x201D; Linley&#x2019;s mind was totally preoccupied by that sword. He felt as though he had suddenly mentally found something. He immediately descended to the ground and closed his eyes, beginning to meditate. Without paying any attention at all to the nearby people, he immediately began to try hard to find that sense again.</p><p></p><hr><p></p>
