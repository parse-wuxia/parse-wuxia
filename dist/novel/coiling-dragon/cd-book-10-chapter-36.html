<p><b><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> Book 10, Baruch &#x2013; Chapter 36: The Door</span></b></p><p>Hunting magical beasts of the eighth and ninth ranks was an extremely difficult task. One could imagine how valuable their magicite cores were. However, the gems in these magicite mines had actually reached the&#xA0;equivalence of the seventh and eighth ranked magicite cores, with some even comparable to magicite cores of the ninth rank.</p><p>Under the light of the torch, the semi-translucent magicite gems produced a bewildering pattern of lights.</p><p>And yet, at the end of the mining tunnel was a door.</p><p>A door that should not have existed.</p><p>&#x201C;I cannot find this door with my spiritual energy. It is as though it does not exist. What is this door?&#x201D; Linley was surprised and puzzled. His spiritual energy couldn&#x2019;t penetrate past this door at all. How could he dare to rashly barge in?</p><p>Linley turned to look at Barker. &#x201C;Barker, did you go in yet?&#x201D;</p><p>Barker nodded. &#x201C;I did. It was precisely because I went in that I felt shocked.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;But Lord, it&#x2019;s best if you go in after transforming. When you step past the door, you will be attacked by a powerful surge of energy. If your defense is insufficient&#x2026;the door alone will kill intruders.&#x201D; Barker said solemnly.</p><p>Linley was secretly shocked.</p><p>Barker was an Undying Warrior Saint, the type of Supreme Warrior with the highest defense. For him to say this&#x2026;one could imagine how powerful the attack was.</p><p>After removing his shirt and baring his upper body, Linley immediately Dragonformed. Instantly, his body was covered by deep azure draconic scales, and he stared at this mysterious &#x2018;door&#x2019; with his now dark golden eyes before walking in.</p><p>&#x201C;Slaaaaaaaaash.&#x201D;</p><p>A knife-like surge of energy wildly chopped at Linley as soon as he walked in the door, slashing at him millions of times, creating sparks atop of Linley&#x2019;s deep azure draconic scales.</p><p>&#x201C;This is&#x2026;&#x201D; As soon as Linley entered, he felt shocked. The scene within the door was totally contrary to Linley&#x2019;s expectations. Behind the door&#x2026;was a translucent &#x2018;bubble&#x2019; of a pocket dimension. This pocket dimension was a spherical dimension, only ten meters long.</p><p>A spherical dimension, ten meters long.</p><p>And this spherical dimension was organized like a training room. It only had a simple desk, bed, and chair. It was protected by that outer barrier, preventing outsiders from easily coming inside.</p><p>Raising his head and staring at the air above, then at his surroundings, he saw that outside the membrane was chaotic space.</p><p>Multicolored chaotic space, with rips in reality occasionally appearing and disappearing. Linley felt awed just looking at that terrifying power.</p><p>&#x201C;Lord Linley.&#x201D; Barker entered as well. &#x201C;When I came here, I also felt it was hard to believe. Tell me, what do you think this is?&#x201D;</p><p>Linley took a deep breath. &#x201C;From what I know, the countless planes of existence are all held within chaotic space. For example, in the Yulan continent, if you continue to head a direction to the very end&#x2026;you will be able to see chaotic space. Once your strength reaches a certain level, you might be able to open your own pocket dimension within the chaotic space.</p><p>Linley carefully inspected this spherical dimension.</p><p>&#x201C;And this spherical dimension that seems like a training room is most likely something which an extremely powerful expert created for training. This expert is most likely of the Yulan continent. Or perhaps it would be better to say&#x2026;he used to be.&#x201D;</p><p>Linley was filled with nothing but the utmost of admiration for the expert who had created this pocket dimension.</p><p>&#x201C;Create a pocket dimension?&#x201D; Barker sighed in amazement as well.</p><p>&#x201C;Didn&#x2019;t the Four Overgods create the Four Higher Planes? Didn&#x2019;t the Seven Principal Sovereigns create the Seven Divine Planes?&#x201D; Linley laughed. &#x201C;There are experts capable of opening their own pocket dimension.&#x201D;</p><p>Linley understood that even Demigods only had the most rudimentary &#x2018;Godrealm&#x2019; technique.</p><p>Someone who could create a stable pocket dimension in the middle of chaotic space was definitely an extraordinary person.</p><p>Barker&#x2019;s eyes lit up. &#x201C;Lord Linley, now I know why there is a massive magicite gem mine here. Look. The elemental essence density here is terrifyingly high. Even someone like me, who has poor elemental essence affinity, can clearly sense all sorts of elements here. And aside from elemental essence, there is a unique energy here as well.&#x201D;</p><p>Linley, too, could sense the thick density of natural elemental essence here.</p><p>Earth, fire, water, wind, thunder, light, darkness. The density of all the elements here was unbelievably high. Aside from these seven, Linley could sense other sorts of energy as well. There was a sort of energy that was rather similar to Zassler&#x2019;s, a terrifying destructive energy, and also an energy filled with life&#x2026;</p><p>&#x201C;This should be the energy belonging to the Four Overgods.&#x201D; Linley knew that aside from the seven elemental types of energy, there were also four types of unique, profound energy.</p><p>Linley looked at Barker. &#x201C;That door should be a connection between the Yulan continent and this dimension. Most likely, this secret room attracted a great deal of elemental energy, which created a huge magicite mine surrounding the door.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;However&#x2026;&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;The mysterious expert who trained here should have left a long, long time ago.&#x201D; Linley was very certain of this.</p><p>&#x201C;Oh?&#x201D; Barker looked at Linley questioningly.</p><p>&#x201C;Without this mysterious expert training here, there is no way such a large amount of elemental essence would have been drawn here. We&#x2019;ve been in the Anarchic Lands for a while now. If we didn&#x2019;t come mining here, who would have discovered all of these magicite gems?&#x201D;</p><p>Linley laughed. &#x201C;Logically speaking, to form such a massive magicite deposit, there should have been a huge amount of elemental essence here, a terrifying amount. Most likely, the experts of the entire Yulan continent would have sensed it.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;But no one in our history has ever mentioned such a thing. Thus, the large amount of elemental energy being drawn here should have been something that happened an extremely long time ago.&#x201D;</p><p>As he spoke, Linley suddenly shut his eyes and sat down.</p><p>&#x201C;Lord Linley?&#x201D; Barker called out softly.</p><p>But Linley seemed to have not noticed him at all, as he sat there in the meditative position quietly.</p><p>The pulse of the world, and its massiveness&#x2026;</p><p>The ferociousness of the wind, and its gentle agility&#x2026;</p><p>The scorching heat of the fire, and its explosiveness&#x2026;</p><p>The softness of the water, like an endless field of cotton&#x2026;</p><p>Within this pocket dimension, Linley could sense nature with greater clarity than he ever had before. Right now, he could also sense with a hundred times his previous clarity the &#x2018;Throbbing Pulse of the World&#x2019;, and the unique tempos possessed by the wind. He could also clearly sense the path he should take next.</p><p>Even the average elemental affinity he had for &#x2018;fire elemental essence&#x2019; was magnified. Linley could clearly sense the fire elemental essence to such a high level that it was as strong as his normal affinity was for earth elemental essence outside of this pocket dimension.</p><p>Although the water elemental essence was still quite indistinct, Linley could still sense its unique rhythm and flows.</p><p>And he could also sense the unique energy coming from the Four Overgods.</p><p>&#x201C;So this is how the throbbing pulse of the world works.&#x201D; Linley felt a surge of joy in his heart. He felt as though his previous training was akin to listening to the sound of a clock from thousands of kilometers away. The sound of the clock was indistinct. But now, he was next to a grandfather clock, listening to the sound. He could clearly sense and hear the unique rhythms of that clock now.</p><p>The mysteries of the Throbbing Pulse of the World suddenly became clear to him.</p><p>&#x201C;256 layers of vibrations? Haha&#x2026;so that&#x2019;s how it works. Here in the Yulan continent, it feels as though there are countless layers to the Throbbing Pulse of the World. But now it seems that although the Throbbing Pulse of the World has layer after layer, that is just the countless mysteries contained with a single layer which carries infinite mysteries, encapsulating all of the mysteries of my 256 layers.&#x201D;</p><p>Linley instantly understood what his path of training should be.</p><p>In the past, Linley&#x2019;s training was similar to reading a book and making the book &#x2018;thicker&#x2019;. But now, what he had to do was make the book &#x2018;thin&#x2019; again. And the book was&#x2026;the &#x2018;Throbbing Pulse of the World&#x2019;, one of the profound truths of the Elemental Laws of Earth.</p><p>&#x201C;Upon having reached the 256 layers, I am halfway through my mastery of the &#x2018;Throbbing Pulse of the World&#x2019;. Now, what I must do is&#x2026;reduced the Profound Truths of the Earth to a single layered wave.&#x201D;</p><p>Originally, he went from one to 256, and now&#x2026;he needed to go back to one.</p><p>Whenever Linley was able to contain all of the profound truths of that Law within a single vibration, and was able to utilize the full force of the &#x2018;Throbbing Pulse of the World&#x2019; in that vibration, only then would he be at the level of mastery. Most likely by then&#x2026;with a single, simple blow from his sword, he would be able to shake his opponent into a pile of mud.</p><p>&#x201C;A precious training ground.&#x201D; Linley opened his eyes, now filled with shocked delight.</p><p>&#x201C;Lord Linley?&#x201D; Barker saw that Linley had woken up. He finally relaxed. &#x201C;Lord, you sat there for three days.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Three days?&#x201D; Linley knew that when immersed in sensing the Laws, the flow of time would become imperceptible. However, it was worth it&#x2026;he had been stuck at the bottleneck with the 256 layers for over a year.</p><p>Without the mysterious training room&#x2026;</p><p>Perhaps he would have been like many other experts and would be stuck at this bottleneck for dozens or hundreds of years, waiting for that moment of sudden insight. Only then would he know how to proceed.</p><p>&#x201C;No wonder that mysterious expert created his own pocket dimension training room. Indeed&#x2026;training within a pocket dimension in chaotic space allows one to sense the various Laws with a much greater clarity.&#x201D; Linley had already become aware of the benefits of this place.</p><p>Although there weren&#x2019;t any treasures or divine artifacts in this room, to an expert training in the various Laws, this room itself was a priceless treasure.</p><p>&#x201C;Thank you for your gift, elder.&#x201D; Linley bowed formally towards the training room.</p><p>Turning his head to look at the puzzled Barker, he said, &#x201C;Barker, let&#x2019;s go out for now. Most likely in a few days, the battle at the prefectural city of Cod&#xA0;will occur.&#x201D; As he spoke, Linley walked out of the pocket dimension.</p><p>Barker was somewhat puzzled. Why had Linley bowed towards that expert who was currently who-knows-where?</p><p>He didn&#x2019;t understand how grateful Linley felt.</p><p>He had been meditating and pondering for over a year, but hadn&#x2019;t improved at all. That sort of stifling feeling was quite uncomfortable. No one knew how long Linley would have been stuck at that bottleneck. But thanks to the secret room, his path of training in the Laws would be a bit easier to walk.</p><p>&#x201C;Nobody is permitted to enter this excavation tunnel. In the future, no one is allowed to mine here as well.&#x201D; As he walked out of the tunnel, he gave the order to the military officers nearby. This pocket dimension was something which one could only dream.</p><p>It was far more precious than any sort of divine artifact.</p><p>Perhaps even the War God or the High Priest would feel envious and desirous if they found out about it.</p><p>&#x201C;Demigods shouldn&#x2019;t have the ability to create a pocket dimension.&#x201D; Linley secretly thought to himself. Linley had the feeling that the ability to create a stable pocket dimension within chaotic space, even a small one, was something only a terrifyingly powerful expert could do.</p><p>Linley and Barker flew side by side towards the prefectural city of Cod.</p><p>The two headed directly to the military headquarters. Within the third floor of that hotel, Watts and his assistants were in a loud argument, but upon seeing Linley and Barker come in, all of them saluted respectfully.</p><p>&#x201C;Watts, what is the current situation?&#x201D; Linley asked.</p><p>Watts hurriedly reported, &#x201C;Lord Linley, according to our investigation, the Radiant Church and the Cult of Shadows are constantly sending people over the river. However, their numbers are too great, and they have all sorts of siege weapons. Most likely, they won&#x2019;t be finished with the river crossing until nightfall.&#x201D;</p><p>Linley nodded slightly.</p><p>&#x201C;I heard arguing just then. What are you arguing about?&#x201D; Barker asked questioningly.</p><p>Watts said, &#x201C;It&#x2019;s like this. Over sixty to seventy thousand troops have already crossed the river. Their forces are somewhat in disarray, which is only natural following a river crossing. My assistants are recommending that we seize the opportunity to go out and attack them.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;However, I vetoed that idea.&#x201D; Watts said.</p><p></p><hr><p></p>
