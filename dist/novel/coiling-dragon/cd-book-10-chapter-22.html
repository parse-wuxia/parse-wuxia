<p><b><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> Book 10, Baruch &#x2013; Chapter 22, The Four Sided Gathering</span></b></p><p>&#x201C;Such powerful spiritual energy. He is able to cause injuries from a distance with it. Lehman wasn&#x2019;t able to resist at all.&#x201D; Linley was utterly shocked. &#x201C;No wonder the War God said that Desri and Fain are two of the five Prime Saints who were at the doorway to becoming a Deity. They only need to take that last step! They are simply too strong.&#x201D;</p><p>Osenno no longer dared to move. His heart, too, was filled with terror.</p><p>&#x201C;Burst.&#x201D; A human figure charged up through the water. It was Lehman. Lehman, at this point, obediently flew to Osenno&#x2019;s side. His face was exceedingly pale, and he stared at Desri with a hint of dread in his eyes.</p><p>Desri looked at these two men with furrowed brows. &#x201C;You know that in the past, I was the leader of the Ascetics. You should also know that I am a Grand Magus Saint.&#x201D;</p><p>Osenno and Lehman exchanged glances.</p><p>Grand Magus Saints specialized in powerful spiritual energy, especially this sort of expert like Desri, who had trained for millennia. When using his spiritual energy, he was on a far higher level than his good friend Hayward. In terms of spiritual energy or in understanding the Elemental Laws of Light, Desri was at the absolute limit of power a Saint could reach.</p><p>With one more step, he would become a Deity.</p><p>&#x201C;Lord Desri.&#x201D; Osenno once more addressed Desri as &#x2018;Lord&#x2019;.</p><p>Osenno still remember the information regarding Desri in the scrolls of the Radiant Church. He knew that Desri had been on extremely close terms with the legendary Holy Emperor Ernst.</p><p>&#x201C;Lord Ernst worked all his life to raise up the Radiant Church. He founded the Holy Union. He let the Radiant Church rise to glory! These five thousand years, we have never given up and never stopped working hard.&#x201D; Osenno&#x2019;s voice was very low.</p><p>Desri frowned.</p><p>In his heart, he didn&#x2019;t feel much affection for the Radiant Church. But, he felt a great deal of guilt towards Ernst. Ernst was like an older brother to him! His older brother had indeed labored on behalf of the Radiant Church his entire life, and in the end, he had gone to the Divine Plane of Light.</p><p>&#x201C;But Linley&#x2026;not only is he himself a Dragonblood Warrior, he has a younger brother and five Undying Warriors under his control. He also has that magical beast, Bebe, who is no weaker than him.&#x201D; Osenno looked at Desri. &#x201C;In a few decades, that means he will have seven peak-stage Supreme Warriors and a terrifying magical beast. If they were to attack together, our Church would be finished!&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Lord Desri, our Church would be finished!&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;The life&#x2019;s labor of Lord Ernst would be destroyed!&#x201D;</p><p>Osenno&#x2019;s voice caused Desri&#x2019;s heart to tremble. He still remember the help and affection which Ernst, his &#x2018;big brother&#x2019;, had given him.</p><p>Linley, Pennslyn, and Delia were standing together. Pennslyn sighed softly to Linley. &#x201C;The only person Desri feels guilty towards is Ernst. He must feel very torn right now.&#x201D;</p><p>The Ernst Institute got its name from Ernst.</p><p>Linley naturally knew much about Ernst as well.</p><p>A sigh could be heard from Desri. Desri stared at both sides, then said in a bright voice. &#x201C;How about this. Both sides take a step back. Consider it giving me, Desri, some face. Alright?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Take a step back?&#x201D; Osenno and Lehman stared at Desri in confusion.</p><p>Linley was mystified as well.</p><p>&#x201C;Both of you, come to the center of the lake.&#x201D; Desri said. Linley trusted Desri, and so with Delia&#x2019;s hand in his own, he flew to the center of the lake. Osenno and Lehman also quite obediently flew to the center of the lake.</p><p>Linley and Delia stood on one side of the massive central boulder, while Osenno and Lehman stood on the other side. Both of them were on guard.</p><p>&#x201C;What is Desri planning?&#x201D; Linley frowned.</p><p>Desri smiled calmly. &#x201C;I know very well that there is a deep grudge between the two of you. How about this&#x2026;in the next twenty years, the Radiant Church is not permitted to kill Linley.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Twenty years?&#x201D; Osenno was unhappy. &#x201C;Lord Desri, twenty years later, Linley will be at the Saint level in human form. Even if we wanted to kill him, we wouldn&#x2019;t be able to. Unfair. Unfair!&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Shut your mouth!&#x201D; Desri had a hint of anger on his face.</p><p>Osenno&#x2019;s heart shook. He suddenly remembered at this moment&#x2026;it was Desri whose words counted.</p><p>&#x201C;This requirement is the same as asking the Radiant Church to take a step. As for you, Linley, I also wish for you to take a step back.&#x201D; Desri looked at Linley.</p><p>&#x201C;Lord Desri, pray tell.&#x201D; Linley said.</p><p>Desri smiled apologetically. &#x201C;Osenno&#x2019;s words are true as well. Linley, you yourself aren&#x2019;t a major threat, but combined with your little brother and those five Undying Warriors, you represent a force of seven Supreme Warriors. That is indeed capable of destroying the Radiant Church. Thus, I want you to agree that from today onward, if you want to seek revenge on the Radiant Church, you have to do so by yourself. The others, including your magical beast, cannot.&#x201D;</p><p>Hearing these words, Osenno and Lehman both let out a sigh of relief.</p><p>What sort of place was the Sacred Isle?</p><p>That was the headquarters for the entire Radiant Church. They had a huge pile of Angel Saints, and the likes of Heidens and Lord Fallen Leaf. And given that the Sacred Isle was also protected by some large-scale magical formations&#x2026;anything short of a Deity would definitely die if they attacked.</p><p>&#x201C;Do you understand what I intend, now?&#x201D; Desri looked at the two sides.</p><p>&#x201C;Our side, within the next twenty years, is not to act against Linley. In exchange for Linley only being allowed to seek revenge on his own?&#x201D; Osenno laughed calmly. &#x201C;I can agree. If we can&#x2019;t even hold you off by yourself, then there is nothing I can say on behalf of our Radiant Church if we are destroyed.&#x201D;</p><p>Osenno agreed easily as well.</p><p>The Radiant Church wasn&#x2019;t afraid of Linley. They were afraid of the entire group of people behind Linley.</p><p>&#x201C;Linley, how about you?&#x201D; Desri looked at Linley.</p><p>In his heart, Linley was rather unwilling.</p><p>&#x201C;Exterminate the Radiant Church by myself?&#x201D; Linley still knew his own limits. &#x201C;A Church which has existed for ten thousand years&#x2026;that&#x2019;s no easy task. But to reach the Deity-level&#x2026;even Cesar spent five thousand years. The legendary War God who reached the Deity-level in a short time period actually was simply fortunate enough to find a divine spark. If it was just based on his own abilities, who knows how long it would have taken?&#x201D;</p><p>Linley frowned.</p><p>&#x201C;Linley!&#x201D; Desri spoke again. Osenno and Lehman were both looking at him.</p><p>Linley suddenly turned to look at Delia by his side. Linley&#x2019;s heart trembled. &#x201C;No matter what, I can&#x2019;t let Delia come to harm.&#x201D; Linley made up his mind. He immediately said to Desri, &#x201C;The Radiant Church is not permitted to attack me within the next twenty years, fine, but there&#x2019;s one more clause&#x2026;they are forever forbidden from harming my family and friends.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Fine.&#x201D; Osenno hurriedly said.</p><p>Linley looked at Osenno, a hint of cold light in his eyes. He secretly said to himself, &#x201C;By myself? Although I might not dare to attack the Sacred Isle, but if I ever meet you people traveling alone, can&#x2019;t I kill you then? If you want, then just stay inside the Sacred Isle forever!&#x201D;</p><p>For the sake of his family and friends, Linley chose to accept this compromise.</p><p>Osenno and Lehman both let out secret sighs of relief. After all, Desri was on Linley&#x2019;s side. They didn&#x2019;t have much support here.</p><p>In the middle of the lake in Mt. Blackraven, Linley&#x2019;s side and the Radiant Church both accepted this treaty.</p><p>&#x201C;If in the next twenty years, Linley comes to attack us, we will counterattack. If he dies due to our counterattack, we cannot be blamed.&#x201D; Osenno hurriedly said. Linley sneered. &#x201C;Hrmph. Don&#x2019;t worry. I don&#x2019;t plan to play word games with you.&#x201D;</p><p>Linley suddenly laughed loudly. &#x201C;If in the future, someone like the War God leads experts to attack the Sacred Isle, I&#x2019;ll also seize the opportunity to go. I cannot be blamed in that situation.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;That naturally wouldn&#x2019;t be your fault.&#x201D; Osenno shook his head.</p><p>If the War God wanted to destroy the Radiant Church, most likely the Radiant Church would&#x2019;ve been finished long ago.</p><p>After the two agreed to the treaty, Delia suddenly said, &#x201C;Then what about the territory in the Anarchic Lands? Will Saints take part in the battles?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Saints?&#x201D; Osenno frowned.</p><p>Indeed. The Radiant Church had a large expanse of territory under its control in the Anarchic Lands, and Linley did as well. If the two came to a fight&#x2026;once Saints got involved in the battle, then perhaps before the twenty years was up, Linley and the Radiant Church would come to blows.</p><p>&#x201C;How about this.&#x201D; Desri spoke.</p><p>&#x201C;Mortal, worldly battles&#x2026;Saints are not to be involved.&#x201D; Desri looked towards Pennslyn. &#x201C;Madame, go find O&#x2019;Casey [Ao&#x2019;ke&#x2019;xi] of the Cult of Shadows. Tell him I need to speak with him. We&#x2019;ll wait for you here.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Fine.&#x201D; Pennslyn nodded, then flew away immediately.</p><p>&#x201C;O&#x2019;Casey? Who is he?&#x201D; Linley frowned as he asked.</p><p>Osenno said, &#x201C;O&#x2019;Casey is the Elder Judge of the Cult of Shadow&#x2019;s Tribunal. His position is equivalent to mine in the Radiant Church. He is also the general supervisor for the Cult of Shadows in the Anarchic Lands.&#x201D;</p><p>Linley nodded.</p><p>&#x201C;In mortal battles, Saints are not to participate. Linley&#x2026;dare you accept?&#x201D; Osenno stared coldly at Linley.</p><p>&#x201C;Barker and his brothers aren&#x2019;t Saints in their human form. They should be able to participate in battle, right?&#x201D; Linley asked.</p><p>&#x201C;Of course. They are just five warriors of the ninth rank.&#x201D; Osenno said disdainfully. &#x201C;Linley, in terms of the numbers of experts of the ninth rank, you are far from being able to match our Radiant Church and the Cult of Shadows.&#x201D;</p><p>Linley smiled confidently, not paying any attention to him.</p><p>&#x201C;Delia.&#x201D; Linley held Delia&#x2019;s hand. Right now, he was still in Dragonform, and his hand was covered with scales, but Delia didn&#x2019;t mind at all. She looked at Linley, and in a soft voice, she said, &#x201C;Linley, thank you.&#x201D;</p><p>Delia knew that Linley had compromised for her sake in part.</p><p>Linley didn&#x2019;t say anything.</p><p>After all these years and having suffered so much, Linley had learned something. Sometimes, a single mistake caused by being unbending could cause someone to suffer a lifetime of regret. The occasional compromise that allows one&#x2019;s loved ones to be safe also allowed one to pursue revenge with even greater ferocity!</p><p>&#x201C;What, I am unable to eliminate the Radiant Church by myself?&#x201D;</p><p>Linley secretly said to himself, &#x201C;In history, has there ever been a Supreme Warrior Saint who was also a Grand Magus Saint?&#x201D; When his power reached its utmost peak, Linley would prepare to challenge the Sacred Isle. Even if he wasn&#x2019;t able to destroy it, he should be able to escape with his life.</p><p>A long time later.</p><p>&#x201C;Boss!&#x201D; A black shadow streaked towards him at high speed.</p><p>&#x201C;Bebe.&#x201D; Linley felt delighted.</p><p>Bebe hopped directly onto Linley&#x2019;s shoulders, then stared angrily at Osenno. &#x201C;This guy came again?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;It&#x2019;s fine now.&#x201D; Linley said.</p><p>&#x201C;Hrmph.&#x201D; Bebe sneered coldly, then said mentally, &#x201C;Boss, don&#x2019;t be afraid of these people. In the Forest of Darkness, I made friends with a few Saint-level magical beasts. All of them are really powerful. When the time comes, I&#x2019;ll ask them to help out and deal with these guys together.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Saint-level magical beast friends?&#x201D; Linley stared at Bebe in astonishment.</p><p>When Linley trained, Bebe would often go have fun in the Forest of Darkness. Unexpectedly, he had actually made friends with Saint-level magical beasts.</p><p>&#x201C;Right. They are all quite powerful. Haeru&#x2019;s race is normally at the ninth rank. He just barely broke through. His power amongst Saint-level magical beasts is just ordinary. But these friends that I made, like &#x2018;Big White&#x2019;, he is a Thunderwinged White Tiger. The &#x2018;Big Guy&#x2019;, he is a Golden Behemoth. Or &#x2018;Big Snake&#x2019;, a Nine-Headed Serpent Emperor.&#x201D;</p><p>Linley was utterly speechless. How could Saint-level magical beasts make friends with other Saint-level magical beasts so easily?</p><p>&#x201C;Right. One of the Saints is also a rat-type magical beast.&#x201D; Bebe chortled.</p><p>Linley was startled.</p><p>A Saint-level rat-type magical beast?</p><p>&#x201C;Unfortunately, he&#x2019;s male.&#x201D; Bebe mentally said with resignation.</p><p>Linley didn&#x2019;t know whether to laugh or to cry. As they mentally conversed, he asked, &#x201C;What does that Saint-level rat-type beast look like? Is he like you?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;No.&#x201D; Bebe shook his head. &#x201C;That Saint-level magical beast is all purple. He&#x2019;s quite handsome. However, he treats me quite well. He even gave me many precious, delicious things to eat.&#x201D; Bebe&#x2019;s face was all smiles.</p><p>Linley secretly sighed.</p><p>A purple Saint-level rat? The books had no record of such a creature. It seems the books were incomplete.</p><p>&#x201C;But Boss, all of those friends of mine are very arrogant. They only became my friends after fighting with me.&#x201D; Bebe&#x2019;s face was covered with a delighted smile.</p><p>Just at this moment, two human figures streaked through the air at high speed. One of the two was Pennslyn. As for the other, it was a man covered in a long black robe. It should have been Osenno&#x2019;s counterpart in the Cult of Shadows; Senior Judge O&#x2019;Casey.</p><p></p><hr><p></p>
