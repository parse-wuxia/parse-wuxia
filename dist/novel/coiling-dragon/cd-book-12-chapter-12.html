<p><b><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> Book 12, The Descent of the Gods &#x2013; Chapter 12 New Variables</span></b></p><p>Entrust him with a task?</p><p>Linley looked at Cesar in confusion. &#x201C;Lord Cesar, pray tell!&#x201D;</p><p>Cesar was, after all, a major, founding figure of the &#x2018;Saber&#x2019; organization, one of the four major assassin&#x2019;s guilds of the Yulan continent. Most mortal affairs, he could simply have Saber handle. For Cesar to ask Linley for assistance definitely meant that this affair was not a simple one.</p><p>&#x201C;Linley, not too long ago, O&#x2019;Brien and Catherine, those two greedy fellows, said that they wanted to take over the entire world, right?&#x201D; Cesar said.</p><p>&#x201C;That was the case, yes.&#x201D; Linley nodded.</p><p>Cesar nodded as well. &#x201C;Whether or not the world is divided up between you three is none of my concern. But you should know that Rosarie and myself have a&#x2026;special&#x2026;relationship.&#x201D; Cesar chuckled. &#x201C;I understand Rosarie&#x2019;s temper quite well. She&#x2019;s remained at the Frost Goddess Shrine this entire time because she truly cares about the Frost Goddess Shrine.&#x201D;</p><p>Linley nodded.</p><p>Rosarie had been training for thousands of years, but she still remained at the Shrine. From this, one could tell how much she valued the Frost Goddess Shrine.</p><p>How many of the experts of the Radiant Church or the Cult of Shadows who had been in training for thousands of years had remained in their respective churches? After all, the goal of these experts who had trained for thousands of years was to become a Deity! If they themselves were on the path to becoming a Deity, why would they feel the need to worship a god?</p><p>Gods required people to have faith in them.</p><p>Rosarie, however, hadn&#x2019;t stayed at the Frost Goddess Shrine this entire day due to her faith in the Frost Goddess. It was because she was emotionally attached to the Frost Goddess Shrine.</p><p>&#x201C;That day, O&#x2019;Brien said that he wanted to have the Eighteen Northern Duchies belong to the O&#x2019;Brien Empire.&#x201D; Cesar shook his head helplessly. &#x201C;Actually, it doesn&#x2019;t really matter if he takes them over. Only, you should understand that the O&#x2019;Brien Empire has an internal regulation that only the worship of the War God, O&#x2019;Brien, is permitted. All other religions are forbidden.&#x201D;</p><p>Linley nodded.</p><p>Even the Radiant Church and Cult of Shadows had only been able to set up intelligence networks within the O&#x2019;Brien Empire. They didn&#x2019;t dare to openly proselytize on a large scale.</p><p>&#x201C;Once the Eighteen Northern Duchies are subdued, given the iron rule of the War God O&#x2019;Brien, he definitely won&#x2019;t permit the Frost Goddess Shrine to continue to exist.&#x201D; Cesar furrowed his forehead. &#x201C;I&#x2019;m worried that Rosarie will act in a hot-headed way and fight against the O&#x2019;Brien Empire.&#x201D;</p><p>Linley now understood why Cesar was concerned.</p><p>&#x201C;Lord Cesar, why are you so concerned about something like this? As long as you are alive, I think the War God won&#x2019;t go too far in his actions.&#x201D; Linley laughed.</p><p>Cesar nodded. &#x201C;Right. As long as I am alive, that is the case. But what if&#x2026;what if on this trip to the Necropolis of the Gods, I die? Would the War God still treat the Frost Goddess Shrine with such courtesy?&#x201D; A hint of frustration could be seen on Cesar&#x2019;s frowning face.</p><p>&#x201C;This&#x2026;&#x201D;</p><p>Linley was silent for a moment. &#x201C;Lord Cesar, why do you have so little confidence in yourself?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;That&#x2019;s not it.&#x201D; Cesar shook his head. &#x201C;Linley, you don&#x2019;t understand. Although all four of us are Demigods, there are still vast differences between Demigods. For example, Saints. Can an early stage Saint possibly compare to you in power?&#x201D;</p><p>An early stage Saint?</p><p>Even a million Abyssal Blade Demons had not been able to stand against Linley, who had killed them as he pleased. The difference between them was as great as that of the heavens and the earth.</p><p>&#x201C;Although we are all Demigods, my strength is the lowest of the four. For example, Dylin. He&#x2019;s already a peak-stage Demigod, and supposedly, he&#x2019;s right at the cusp of breaking through to become a full God.&#x201D; Cesar shook his head as he spoke.</p><p>Cesar was only an early stage Demigod, after all.</p><p>The others? The War God had become a Deity five thousand years ago, and the High Priest had become a Deity over ten thousand years ago. As for Dylin? He, too, had become a Deity tens of thousands of years ago.</p><p>&#x201C;The person with the greatest chance of dying in the Necropolis of the Gods is actually myself.&#x201D; Cesar said.</p><p>&#x201C;Then, Lord Cesar, why are you going to the Necropolis of the Gods?&#x201D; Linley asked.</p><p>&#x201C;The first reason is, I am forced to go. The second is&#x2026;&#x201D; Cesar&#x2019;s eyes lit up. &#x201C;A long, lazy, life eventually grows boring as well. I want to once more experience the excitement of life-and-death struggles. In the past, when I was with Armand, we walked on the edge of life and death. Also, my career as an assassin. That truly was an exciting life. I miss it very much.&#x201D;</p><p>Cesar still had the heart of a warrior.</p><p>Linley understood.</p><p>Warriors such as Cesar wouldn&#x2019;t be able to forever slumber in a quiet lifestyle. What they needed was battle, was heart-pounding activities, was new breakthroughs, was rising to higher and higher levels!</p><p>&#x201C;Linley, are you willing to help out in Rosarie&#x2019;s affairs?&#x201D; Cesar asked directly.</p><p>&#x201C;Of course I am willing. Lord Cesar, how could I dare to not be willing?&#x201D; Linley said with a smirk.</p><p>&#x201C;You little punk.&#x201D; Cesar grinned as well.</p><p>Within ten years or so, Linley would become a Deity. Even more importantly&#x2026;Linley had a special relationship with Bebe and Beirut. This was the reason why Cesar had come to ask for Linley&#x2019;s assistance. As long as Linley was willing to get involved, even if the War God came back from the Necropolis of the Gods, he wouldn&#x2019;t act against Rosarie.</p><p>&#x201C;Linley, O&#x2019;Brien, Catherine!&#x201D;</p><p>An ancient voice suddenly rang out in Linley&#x2019;s mind. Not just Linley&#x2019;s; the War God at War God Mountain and the High Priest in the Yulan Empire both heard this same voice.</p><p>Linley&#x2019;s face changed.</p><p>Lord Beirut!</p><p>&#x201C;I know that you are planning to start a war in the continent. I don&#x2019;t care what happens to the rest of the Yulan continent, but there are two things you need to remember. The first is that you are not to disturb the peace of the Forest of Darkness. The second is that your armies are not permitted to enter the Eighteen Northern Duchies, nor are you permitted to engage in slaughter in the Eighteen Northern Duchies. Understood?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Yes, Lord Beirut.&#x201D;</p><p>The War God, the High Priest, and Linley all simultaneously responded back mentally.</p><p>Who would dare violate the orders of Lord Beirut?</p><p>Lord Beirut retracted his divine presence from their minds.</p><p>&#x201C;Truly terrifying. His divine sense was able to instantly cover the entire Yulan continent.&#x201D; Linley sighed with endless praise. &#x201C;Lord Beirut&#x2019;s power is simply too great, far above the likes of the War God.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;What happened, Linley?&#x201D; Cesar, seeing that Linley had become lost in thought, couldn&#x2019;t help but grow confused.</p><p>Linley looked at Cesar, then understood. Just then, Lord Beirut had only spoke with his divine sense to give orders to Linley, the War God, and the High Priest. The other experts didn&#x2019;t know about it.</p><p>&#x201C;Lord Cesar, weren&#x2019;t you worrying about Rosarie just now?&#x201D; Linley laughed.</p><p>Cesar nodded, looking at Linley questioningly.</p><p>&#x201C;No need to worry any longer.&#x201D; Linley said.</p><p>Cesar was somewhat baffled. &#x201C;What&#x2019;s going on?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Just now, Lord Beirut mentally spoke to myself, the War God, and the High Priest. The Eighteen Northern Duchies are off limits. No armies are permitted to invade, nor are we permitted to engage in battle and slaughter there.&#x201D; Linley laughed towards Cesar. &#x201C;Lord Cesar, now you should be at ease.&#x201D;</p><p>Cesar let out a long sigh, then smiled.</p><p>&#x201C;But I don&#x2019;t understand. Why is Lord Beirut doing this? Could it be that he is doing it for my sake? I think&#x2026;I&#x2019;m not important enough for him to do it just for me.&#x201D; Cesar didn&#x2019;t understand.</p><p>&#x201C;If you can&#x2019;t figure it out, then stop worrying about it. It&#x2019;s a good thing, right?&#x201D; Linley laughed.</p><p>Cesar laughed as well. &#x201C;Haha, right. It&#x2019;s a good thing. Right, Linley. I won&#x2019;t bother you any further.&#x201D; After speaking, Cesar disappeared into thin air. Even at Linley&#x2019;s level of power, he could just barely see Cesar&#x2019;s figure transform into a blur, then disappear.</p><p>&#x201C;This Shadowshape Technique is at the level of allowing the shadow he transforms into to become completely invisible. How terrifying.&#x201D; Linley sighed in praise to himself.</p><p>This night was definitely not going to be an ordinary night.</p><p>Shortly after Cesar had left, yet another person appeared in Linley&#x2019;s study. But when this person arrived, Linley didn&#x2019;t notice his presence in the slightest, and he continued to read his book. Only after he flipped through several pages did he notice out of the corner of his eyes that someone was in the room with him.</p><p>Linley was instantly so frightened that his heart clenched.</p><p>&#x201C;Lord Beirut.&#x201D; Linley immediately stood up.</p><p>The man was still dressed in that long black robe, with black hair, a black beard, and a hint of a smile on his face. It was the King of the Yulan Continent&#x2026;Beirut. Beirut said with a faint smile, &#x201C;Linley, wait a moment. When Bebe comes, we&#x2019;ll talk.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Bebe?&#x201D; Linley was confused.</p><p>&#x201C;Swish!&#x201D; A few seconds later, a black shadow suddenly scurried over, and Bebe jumped directly in front of Beirut. &#x201C;Grandpa Beirut, why have you come?&#x201D;</p><p>Beirut looked at Bebe, beaming so widely that his eyes turned into merry little slits. Beirut had lived an incalculably long time, but out of all of his descendants, only Bebe was a &#x2018;Godeater Rat&#x2019; as well. It could be said&#x2026;that Bebe, to Beirut, was as important as life itself.</p><p>&#x201C;The reason I have come today is to bring Bebe back to the Forest of Darkness.&#x201D; Beirut spoke, while looking benevolently towards Bebe.</p><p>&#x201C;Back to the Forest of Darkness? Why do I have to go there? I like being here.&#x201D; Bebe was rather unwilling.</p><p>But Linley suddenly had a thought.</p><p>Lord Beirut definitely wouldn&#x2019;t do this for no reason at all. He definitely had some sort of special purpose to this.</p><p>&#x201C;Lord Beirut, might I ask why you are doing this?&#x201D; Linley looked at Beirut.</p><p>Beirut patted Bebe dotingly. &#x201C;Bebe, as a divine beast, &#x2018;Godeater Rat&#x2019;, has reached the late stage of his growth period. He&#x2019;ll soon reach adulthood. Upon reaching adulthood, Bebe will naturally reach the Deity level. This period of time is an extremely important period of time for him.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;I&#x2019;m about to become a Deity?&#x201D; Bebe said with surprise and delight.</p><p>&#x201C;Most likely, you&#x2019;ll need another ten years. These ten years, Bebe, will be the most important ten years of your life.&#x201D; Beirut said seriously.</p><p>Linley understood. Beirut himself was a &#x2018;Godeater Rat&#x2019;, and in the countless planes of the universe, Lord Beirut was naturally the person who knew the most about Godeater Rats. Linley cared about Bebe as well, and wanted Bebe to develop in a good way and become more powerful in the future. &#x201C;Bebe, go to the Forest of Darkness. After all, during this period of time, I need to enter closed door training as well, most likely for around ten years.&#x201D;</p><p>Bebe was silent for a moment, and then exchanged a glance with Linley before nodding. &#x201C;Fine, then. But Boss, if you are free, you have to chat with me spiritually.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Fine.&#x201D; Linley laughed.</p><p>Beirut had a smile on his face as well. He was very satisfied with Linley&#x2019;s actions.</p><p>&#x201C;Linley, there&#x2019;s something I must let you know about.&#x201D; Beirut said.</p><p>Linely&#x2019;s heart tightened, and he immediately said respectfully, &#x201C;Lord Beirut, pray tell.&#x201D; Beirut nodded, then continued. &#x201C;I know that you are all preparing to attack the other Empires and to unify the Yulan continent. A few decades ago or a few centuries ago, this would have been an easy task, but now&#x2026;&#x201D;</p><p>Beirut shook his head.</p><p>Linley couldn&#x2019;t help but feel surprised. Beirut&#x2019;s words definitely wouldn&#x2019;t miss the mark. But based on the plans that the War God and the others had drawn up, there shouldn&#x2019;t be any problems. After having exterminated the opponents&#x2019; Saints and then sending out their armies while using their own Saints to threaten the enemies, or even use forbidden-level magic to frighten them as necessary&#x2026;</p><p>This should be a sure thing.</p><p>&#x201C;Lord Beirut, what do you mean?&#x201D; Linley looked at Beirut.</p><p>Beirut smiled as he glanced at Linley. &#x201C;This war won&#x2019;t be as simple as you imagine it to be. I recommend that you not be too ambitious. Enough, I&#x2019;ve said all I care to say. Time to leave.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Boss.&#x201D; Bebe waved farewell to Linley as well.</p><p>Holding Bebe in his arms, Beirut disappeared from the study. He was so fast that Linley couldn&#x2019;t even tell how Beirut had moved, or what powerful technique he might have used. His technique was clearly on a far higher level than Cesar&#x2019;s.</p><p>&#x201C;Why did Lord Beirut suddenly give me this warning?&#x201D; Seated in his study, Linley frowned pensively. &#x201C;This war won&#x2019;t be as simple as I imagine it to be? Could it be that something unexpected is going to occur? And he also told me not to be too ambitious?&#x201D; Linley suddenly had a thought.</p><p>&#x201C;Lord Beirut had also ordered us not to attack the Eighteen Northern Duchies.&#x201D;</p><p>The combination of these various issues felt Linley to suddenly feel a sense of pressure.</p><p>&#x201C;We have to be careful in waging this war. We need to take it slow.&#x201D; Linley made up his mind. The very next morning, he would go find Cena and give him some instructions.</p><p>As for tonight&#x2026;</p><p>Mountain Range of Magical Beasts. Deep within the Foggy Valley.</p><p>This place had once been the lair of the Armored Razorback Wyrm. In the past, Linley had luckily been able to swallow the blood and the draconic crystal of the Armored Razorback Wyrm, activating the Dragonblood lineage in his body and allowing him to transform into a Dragonblood Warrior. And here, too&#x2026;</p><p>Dylin, after Linley drew out Bloodviolet, and his three Six-Eyed Golden Ni-Lion sons had been released.</p><p>In the same location&#x2026;.</p><p>&#x201C;Riiiiiiiiip.&#x201D; The space here was rippling like water, with the ripples growing greater and greater, before finally, a huge gaping hole in space was torn.</p><p>&#x201C;Swish!&#x201D; &#x201C;Swish!&#x201D; &#x201C;Swish!&#x201D;</p><p>Eight figures charged out at high speed, all of whom appeared to be humanoid. Some of them had horns, while others were covered with tattered robes. The eight figures that fled out from the hole were all in sorry shape, but they were all wildly overjoyed.</p><p>&#x201C;Ahhh&#x2026;.this elemental aura&#x2026;how wonderful it is.&#x201D; A powerful looking figure with a pair of ox-horns on his head said, so excited his entire body was shaking.</p><p>&#x201C;Back! Finally, I&#x2019;m back!&#x201D; Another knelt on the ground, crying in excitement. &#x201C;I&#x2019;ve finally managed to escape that damnable place alive. The smell of the earth is so intoxicating.&#x201D;</p><p>The eight figures were all extremely excited.</p><p>&#x201C;Everyone, we&#x2019;ve all managed to escape from the Gebados Planar Prison. Now&#x2026;let us part ways.&#x201D; A handsome man with pointed ears and long, jade green hair said with a loud laugh.</p><p>&#x201C;Haha, after living in terror for thousands of years, it&#x2019;s time to enjoy ourselves.&#x201D; The eight figures suddenly left the ground, each flying in a different direction.</p><p></p><hr><p></p>
