<p><b><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> Book 10, Baruch &#x2013; Chapter 12, A Sudden Change of Events</span></b></p><p>The night was pitch-black. Dark clouds covered the moon, and the entire world was cast in shadows. Suddenly&#x2026;from the north, nine streaks of white light blazed through the sky at high speed towards the Sherry Duchy. Halfway there, five of the streaks of white light changed to fly towards each of the five small cities around the Sherry Duchy, while the other four streaks of light flew towards the prefectural city of Sherry.</p><p>If one drew near, one would discover&#x2026;</p><p>That these streaks of light were awe-inspiring Angels who were radiating a soft, holy light. Every single one of these Angels had four wings. For them to immediately enter their Angel forms meant that the bodies they had descended into were totally capable of sustaining their might.</p><p>According to the hierarchy of Angels&#x2026;</p><p>Two-Winged Angels were low-level Angels, Four-Winged Angels were middle-stage Angels, while Six Winged Angels were peak-stage Angels. As for Eight-Winged Angels&#x2026;those were of the Demigod level. The legendary Twelve-Winged Angels possessed the awe-inspiring might of a Highgod.</p><p>Unfortunately, in the Yulan continent, it was impossible to find a body capable of withstanding the descent of a Twelve-Winged Angel.</p><p>&#x201C;What a pity&#x2026;&#x201D; Osenno, flying behind those four Angels, mused to himself while staring at them. &#x201C;The Radiant Sovereign created these humanoid constructs, but there is no chance of them making any breakthroughs. No matter how long they live for, their power will not change at all.&#x201D;</p><p>People of Osenno&#x2019;s level knew a great deal about what Angels were.</p><p>Angels, in truth, weren&#x2019;t living creatures. They were humanoid constructs which the Radiant Sovereign had created in the Divine Realm of Light. Of course, Osenno had no idea how they were created, but he understood that Angels would never be able to break through. However many wings they were created with, that was how many wings they would forever have. For example, the Radiant Church had Angels who had lived for thousands of years, but their power was the exact same level as it had been thousands of years ago.</p><p>Although Angels were powerful, they were not capable of advancing.</p><p>This caused Osenno to somewhat look down on the Angels. He just treated the Angels as tools. On this day, his forces consisted solely of Angels, aside from himself. Not a single human Saint had come. As far as Osenno was concerned, the lives of human Saints, who were capable of advancement, were far more valuable than these Angels.</p><p>Within one of the smaller cities in the Sherry Duchy, a Four-Winged Angel descended into the center of the city. The soft, holy radiance around the Four-Winged Angel suffused the surrounding area, turning the night into day and illuminating the city.</p><p>Seeing this light, the citizens of this village all came running out.</p><p>&#x201C;Ah! Angel!&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;An Angel!&#x201D;</p><p>Everyone here was awestruck. Due to the long-term presence of the Radiant Church, many of these people believed in the Radiant Sovereign. Now, all of them had the feeling that the emissary of the Lord had come to save them.</p><p>Countless civilians fell to their knees.</p><p>&#x201C;Those who have faith in the Lord shall receive the Lord&#x2019;s protection. Those who betray the Lord shall be destroyed in the end.&#x201D; The Four-Winged Angel&#x2019;s voice penetrated throughout the little city, and over half of the four thousand soldiers in the town fell to their knees as well. As for the others who came from Blackdirt City, they stood there, feeling astonished.</p><p>An Angel?</p><p>A legendary Angel?</p><p>&#x201C;Kill those heathens!&#x201D; Suddenly, someone drew out his sword and stabbed a nearby military officer to death. Many of the military officers here were from the prefectural city of Moat. They didn&#x2019;t believe in the Radiant Sovereign, and had even destroyed several churches in recent days.</p><p>But today&#x2026;</p><p>A large number of nearby soldiers as well as civilians began to charge forward to kill all of the outsiders.</p><p>Without having to do a single thing, the Four-Winged Angel had reclaimed this city.</p><p>&#x201C;Followers of the Lord, the Lord shall definitely give you his protection.&#x201D; The Four-Winged Angel&#x2019;s voice rang out.</p><p>The entire city was on its knees, filled with sincerity and faith. A smile appeared on the face of the Four-Winged Angel. He had easily discovered that there were over ten or so people here who trained in light-style magic. The Four-Winged Angel landed on the ground and walked towards one of the experts. &#x201C;What is your name?&#x201D;</p><p>The silver-haired old man was very excited. He respectfully said, &#x201C;Oh, mighty and venerated Lord Angel, my name is Felton [Fei&#x2019;er&#x2019;dun]. In the past, I was a priest in the Radiant Church here in this town. I was lucky enough to survive.&#x201D;</p><p>The Four-Winged Angel nodded. &#x201C;From today onwards, Felton shall be the city governor for this city.&#x201D; The Four-Winged Angel&#x2019;s voice shook the skies, penetrating the entire city.</p><p>&#x201C;Felton!&#x201D; &#x201C;Felton!&#x201D; &#x201C;Felton!&#x201D;</p><p>The citizens of this village all began to shout loudly in joy. As they chanted, the Four-Winged Angel flew into the air, and in a burst of dazzling, holy light, the Four-Winged Angel left this little city and flew towards the prefectural city.</p><p>The other four little cities saw the exact same happen. The appearance of the Angels caused the believers of the Radiant Church to go crazy, and they fearlessly slaughtered the &#x2018;heathens&#x2019;, while those who trained in light-style magic or light-style battle-qi became appointed the new city governors.</p><p>As for the prefectural city of Sherry&#x2026;</p><p>When the other five Four-Winged Angels had arrived, fires could be seen everywhere, because there were many soldiers who had come here from the prefectural city of Moat or from Blackdirt City, causing the battle here to be extremely intense.</p><p>&#x201C;Lord Praetor.&#x201D; The five Angels flew to Osenno&#x2019;s side.</p><p>Osenno stood in mid-air, watching the three major battles going on below. Three Four-Winged Angels were currently engaging in battle with three Undying Warriors.</p><p>&#x201C;Undying Warriors?&#x201D; One of the Angels called out in surprise. Osenno nodded calmly. When Osenno had brought these four Angels to the prefectural city, due to the majestic awe-inspiring presence of the Angels, countless citizens began to attack Linley&#x2019;s forces.</p><p>Even some soldiers had turned traitor.</p><p>This battle was extremely unfavorable for Linley&#x2019;s side.</p><p>&#x201C;F*ck off!&#x201D; A terrifying, three-meter tall body that looked like a war machine, with bulging, muscled arms the size of a human waist. The man was covered with a layer of marble-like armor, revealing only his face, which was an awe-inspiring green color.</p><p>A Saint-level Undying Warrior!</p><p>Three Four-Winged Angels fighting three Saint-level Undying Warriors.</p><p>&#x201C;Second brother, these guys are too fast.&#x201D; Gates shouted angrily. The three people here were Gates, Hazer, and Ankh. All three of them were only warriors of the ninth rank. Even after transforming into Undying Warriors&#x2026;they were only early-stage Saints. Perhaps they had the advantages of possessing the terrifying &#x2018;defense&#x2019; and &#x2018;strength&#x2019; inherent to Undying Warriors, they were able to fight the middle-stage Four-Winged Angels head on&#x2026;but the Angels were too nimble.</p><p>A Four-Winged Angel very agilely swooped in from the side, kicking viciously against Gates. That kick, easily capable of shattering boulders, landed directly on Gates, but it only caused his body to tremble slightly.</p><p>Gates suddenly stared up at the sky, and saw that even more Angels had come. He immediately shouted, &#x201C;Second brother, third brother, let&#x2019;s go, now! More Angels are coming!&#x201D;</p><p>They weren&#x2019;t even able to handle three Angels, but six more Angels could now be seen above them, along with that human Saint. How could they win this battle?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Let&#x2019;s go. The Radiant Church is really going all-out this time.&#x201D; Ankh growled with anger as well.</p><p>With mighty leaps that caused the ground to shake and shatter, the three flew wildly towards the north like human meteors. However, of the Four Supreme Warriors, the Undying Warriors had the slowest flying speed.</p><p>As for Angels, they specialized in speed.</p><p>With a flicker of their wings, four of the Four-Winged Angels instantly appeared in front of Gates and the other two, while the other five remaining Four-Winged Angels appeared behind them.</p><p>&#x201C;Fifth brother, what should we do?&#x201D; Hazer looked at Gates.</p><p>Of the five brothers, Gates usually had the most ideas, but right now, seeing how they were surrounded by nine Angels, he only had the desire to cry. Good heavens. The difference in power was just too vast.</p><p>One on one, they could just barely fight to a standstill.</p><p>Nine on three? How could they fight?</p><p>&#x201C;What to do?&#x201D; An insane light appeared in Gates&#x2019; eyes. &#x201C;Motherf*cker. Let&#x2019;s go all out. If we take one with us, that&#x2019;s a fair trade. If we take out two, we&#x2019;ll have profited.&#x201D; Gates let out a growl, then wildly charged towards the Angels. Although the Four-Winged Angels had good defense, they didn&#x2019;t dare to clash head on against these human-shaped monsters.</p><p>The distant Osenno said calmly, &#x201C;Angel Battle Formation.&#x201D;</p><p>Instantly&#x2026;</p><p>Three of the Four-Winged Angels flew away at high speed, while the other six Four-Winged Angels immediately set up the Angel Battle Formation, surrounding Gates and his brothers. One was above them, one was below them, while four were around them. This sudden encirclement caused Gates, Hazer, and Ankh to all be stunned.</p><p>&#x201C;Break through!&#x201D; Gates charged viciously against one of those walls of light.</p><p>&#x201C;Bang!&#x201D;</p><p>A terrifying, blazing force pierced towards Gates&#x2019; white armor, knocking him backwards.</p><p>&#x201C;Fifth brother, are you alright?&#x201D; Ankh immediately went to support him.</p><p>&#x201C;I&#x2019;m fine.&#x201D; A hint of blood could be seen at the corner of Gates&#x2019; lips. &#x201C;What tremendous force. It should most likely be comparable to a peak-stage Saint. Fortunately, this Undying Warrior Armor is also very strong. Otherwise, I&#x2019;d be dead.&#x201D;</p><p>Osenno flew over, calmly watching Hazer, Ankh, and Gates. &#x201C;Saint-level Undying Warriors. The Armand clan?&#x201D;</p><p>Gates and the others didn&#x2019;t pay any attention to Osenno.</p><p>&#x201C;I&#x2019;ll give you three a chance. As long as you are willing to surrender to our Church, then I won&#x2019;t kill you.&#x201D; Osenno said calmly.</p><p>Gates, Ankh, and Hazer exchanged glances.</p><p>&#x201C;Motherf*cker, if you have the ability to kill us, then come kill us.&#x201D; Gates stared angrily at Osenno. &#x201C;Daddy aint afraid of you!&#x201D;</p><p>Osenno&#x2019;s face turned cold.</p><p>&#x201C;Do you take your old man to be a fool?&#x201D; Gates said, staring upwards. &#x201C;Stop bullshitting. Can it be that your Radiant Church has forgotten Lord Cesar&#x2019;s warning?&#x201D; In the past, the King of Killers, Cesar, had said long ago that if the Radiant Church dared to act against the five brothers, then Cesar would slaughter a path to the Sacred Isle.</p><p>Osenno snorted coldly.</p><p>Indeed, just now he had just been trying to trick Gates. He really didn&#x2019;t dare to kill Gates and his brothers. After all&#x2026;he didn&#x2019;t dare to disobey the words of Cesar. The King of Killers who had become a Saint five thousand years ago had reached a terrifying level of power long ago.</p><p>And in recent years, he had reached the Deity-level.</p><p>He had become a Deity!</p><p>Even if Osenno was ten times as bold, he wouldn&#x2019;t dare to offend him. Offending him&#x2026;meant that perhaps the Radiant Church would face annihilation.</p><p>&#x201C;Disperse the Angel Battle Formation.&#x201D; Osenno said calmly.</p><p>&#x201C;Hrm?&#x201D; Gates and the other three exchanged glances. Could it be that Osenno would be so kind-hearted as to release them? But as soon as the six Four-Winged Angels dispersed the Angel Battle Formation, Osenno&#x2019;s body transformed into a black blur. Gates and his brothers didn&#x2019;t have the chance to dodge at all.</p><p>&#x201C;Bang!&#x201D; &#x201C;Bang!&#x201D; &#x201C;Bang!&#x201D;</p><p>Three vicious kicks landed against each of the three brothers, transforming these three humanoid monsters into meteors which slammed into the ground at high speed.</p><p>&#x201C;Boom!&#x201D; The ground split apart from the collision, and the earth itself shook violently. Three massive human-shaped craters appeared, with Gates and his brothers in the center of each of them. Their white armor had cracked like a tortoise-shell, and blood was vomiting forth from their mouths.</p><p>They could no longer move. Osenno&#x2019;s control of force had been perfect. Although he had badly injured them, they weren&#x2019;t in any mortal danger.</p><p>With a flip of his hand, Osenno retrieved three adamantine-alloyed manacles and tossed them to the nearby Angels. &#x201C;Help me chain them up. You two are responsible for watching over them. The rest of you, come with me to the prefectural city of Moat.&#x201D; After finishing his words, Osenno flew off towards the north, not even looking at Gates and the others, followed by seven Four-Winged Angels who followed him.</p><p>Between the prefectural city of Sherry and the prefectural city of Moat was a distance of a few hundred kilometers.</p><p>Gates and his brothers had been suddenly ambushed, and they hadn&#x2019;t had a chance to even warn the remaining brothers. Caught totally off-guard, the prefectural city of Moat was hit by the sneak attack of Osenno and the seven Four-Winged Angels as well. This time, Osenno acted very quickly!</p><p>As soon as Barker and Boone had transformed into their Undying Warrior forms, Osenno had given each of them a kick.</p><p>&#x201C;Bang!&#x201D; &#x201C;Bang!&#x201D;</p><p>The two Undying Warriors were smashed into the ground by the kicks, creating two man-shaped craters.</p><p>&#x201C;And there&#x2019;s a Saint-level magical beast as well.&#x201D; Osenno&#x2019;s spiritual energy quickly discovered the Blackcloud Panther, Haeru, who was currently retreating at high speed. As soon as Haeru had seen Barker and Boone be defeated in the blink of an eye, he had known what the situation was. If he were to defeat Barker and Boone at the same time, he would have to spend a little bit of time.</p><p>This mysterious human Saint was simply too powerful.</p><p>Without even doing battle, Haeru had immediately turned tail and fled.</p><p>&#x201C;Master, master. Come back, quick!&#x201D; Haeru called out in his mind.</p><p></p><hr><p></p>
