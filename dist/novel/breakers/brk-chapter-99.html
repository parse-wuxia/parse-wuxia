Felicia then opened her mouth and said,</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Hey, is there no time at all? I want to take a look at this floor at least. We might not get to look around next time.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Her face was filled with regret.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Silvan sighed at Felicia&#x2019;s attitude and called out her name with the tone of an aggravated older brother.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;Felicia.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Shutra, what do you think?&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">However, Felicia just talked over him and called out to Shutra instead. Felicia glanced at In-gong who replied with a frown,</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;As Seira said, 10 days is an ample amount of time. And to a certain extent, Felicia noona is correct. To be honest, isn&#x2019;t it a little disappointing?&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">This was the lair of an elder dragon.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Until now, they had been to places related to an elder dragon, but this was the first lair.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">In the case of the Great Enkidu, it had been a place to store treasures &#xA0;rather than Enkidu&#x2019;s lair. Additionally, they hadn&#x2019;t even visited Watcher Ainkel&#x2019;s place.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Felicia&#x2019;s expression brightened as In-gong sided with her.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Isn&apos;t it? Shutra thinks so as well? Isn&#x2019;t it a shame to just leave?&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Felicia was more emotional than usual due to her regret and desperation. It was pretty cute, but In-gong spoke without losing his composure.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;However, Noona, will you really just look around? My guess is that we&#x2019;ve seen half of this floor. Can&#x2019;t it be delayed for a few days?&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">He could roughly guess the scale of the place through the mini-map.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Of course, he couldn&#x2019;t reveal the basis of the information, but the group regarded it as true.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;Felicia.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Silvan called Felicia&#x2019;s name once again, but she ignored it.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Felicia folded her arms and shook her head.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Uhh, won&#x2019;t it be okay just for today? Amita... we can leave at night.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Their transportation wasn&#x2019;t a carriage but a flying ship. She felt sorry for Silvan&#x2019;s crew members, but they could move at any time, morning or night. Taking a break wasn&apos;t a problem either. They could rest while the flying ship was moving.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Felicia gazed at In-gong with earnest eyes and Delia, who was also interested in exploring ruins, had a similar expression.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Would In-gong allow it?</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">As everyone paid attention to In-gong, Silvan once again felt isolated.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">In this situation, shouldn&#x2019;t Felicia be seeking permission from Silvan who was her older brother and the master of the flying ship?</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Why was she asking permission from the youngest prince, Shutra?</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">As Silvan floundered about, In-gong sighed like it couldn&#x2019;t be helped and said with a smile,</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;That should be fine.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">They were supposed to return to the Demon King&#x2019;s Palace within 10 days. Half a day wouldn&#x2019;t be a detrimental hindrance.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Moreover, In-gong was interested in the areas he hadn&#x2019;t seen yet.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">He had achieved his goal after acquiring Kaltein&#x2019;s Night Watch, but it would be a shame to go back with just that.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&apos;Maybe I can get more information.&#x2019;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">The records of a destroyed species&#x2026;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">And information about who attacked Violent Kaltein.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Neither were important at the moment, but it wasn&#x2019;t bad to know.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">As In-gong gave permission, Felicia jumped up and cheered. Her face was bright like a young child.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;Yes! Okay! Then let&#x2019;s look around!&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;Felicia.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Silvan called Felicia for the third time. This time, Felicia did something worse than ignoring him.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Oppa, can go back to the flying ship first? Do you know how to use the magic tool that allows you to breathe underwater?&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Silvan&#x2019;s shoulders sagged at her words and he said,</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;I&#x2019;ll just stay with you.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Okay.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Felicia hummed lightly as she walked toward a path they hadn&#x2019;t been to yet. As everyone followed, Carack patted Silvan&#x2019;s shoulder lightly.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Prince, cheer up.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">The orc&#x2019;s tone was inappropriate despite being Shutra&#x2019;s aide, but Silvan didn&#x2019;t rebuke him for the rudeness.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Was it a type of charm that somehow couldn&#x2019;t be resisted?&#xA0;</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">It was actually comforting.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Carack patted his shoulders a few more times and Silvan stepped forward with a grim expression.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&amp;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">After following Felicia for three hours, the party accomplished a lot in Kaltein&#x2019;s lair.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Nothing else at the Night Watch&#x2019;s standard was found, but there was a considerable amount of artifacts, gold and silver as well as archeological data that was more valuable than gold to Felicia.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">No records related to the extinct species were found, but In-gong was also satisfied. Thanks to being well instructed by the sword duke on dungeon exploration, he was able to get his hands on a considerable amount of gold and silver.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">He already had quite a lot of gold packed, but it never hurt to have more.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">In the final stretch of the exploration, they found a staircase leading down. Felicia made a pitiful expression, but it was impossible to delay any further.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">He didn&#x2019;t know why but Silvan was also sulking, so the dark elf siblings looked strangely cute and pitiful.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">However, In-gong urged Felicia with a decisive expression and the party was able to leave Kaltein&#x2019;s lair on time.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Lift up the anchor and spread the sails. We are going back to Spider Forest now. Soar, soar! Black Flame Dragon ho!&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Silvan cried out towards the sky from the deck of the flying ship. Although it was eccentric, it was what Silvan always did, so the crew members rushed to depart without paying any attention.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Then after half a day&#x2026;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Once it was close to dawn, the party was able to reach Spider Forest.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;It is insane to come at this hour.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">At the entrance of the small temple, Amita glared with sleepy eyes while being carried by Daphne.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Instead of asking, &#x2018;Aren&#x2019;t raccoons originally nocturnal?&#x2019;, In-gong looked at the person standing next to Daphne.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;I&#x2019;m back, Your Highness.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;I&#x2019;m back as well. Good job, Karma.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Karma smiled at In-gong&#x2019;s reply, but she looked awkward. She had gone to call for support, but everything had already ended. As a result, it seemed like she didn&#x2019;t help at all.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Carack sent Karma a look of consolation and she smiled.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">It was at that moment that Daphne, who was carrying Amita, gazed at the Black Flame Dragon with wide eyes.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;This is... Is this perhaps a dragon?&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Silver scales shone in the light.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Amita narrowed their eyes and shook their head from within Daphne&#x2019;s arms.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;No, it is a sea serpent. The owner of Sun Lake was one, but he is gone now.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Amita clicked their tongue, but they seemed quite satisfied. They asked the party in a loud and cheerful voice,</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;Anyway, what happened this time? Why are you in such a rush?&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">There had to be a reason why they left the lake forcefully and arrived so early.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Felicia came forward and replied,</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Amita, something urgent has come up, &#xA0;so we need to go back to the Demon King&#x2019;s Palace. There might be trouble which is why we hurried here to get Daphne and Karma. I&#x2019;m sorry.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Huh? Return to the Demon King&#x2019;s Palace? Then what about the equipment I have to make?&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">They had just started the work, so there was no properly finished product.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Carack blinked and asked,</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Uh, Raccoon. Do you have something like delivery?&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Ridiculous! I don&#x2019;t know when you&#x2019;re going to visit me again and I have no intention of delivery.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">This wasn&#x2019;t a local blacksmith but Amita, the world&#x2019;s greatest blacksmith. The mention of a delivery service was ridiculous.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Carack smiled like he had expected this and continued in a sly voice,</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Then how about going with us?&quot;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;What?&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Didn&#x2019;t you say that you have to defend the last flame? Don&#x2019;t hide in harsh places and just come with us. There is no place safer than the Demon King&#x2019;s Palace.&quot;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">As he spoke, Carack sneaked a peek at Daphne. She recognized what he meant and added quickly,</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;It is a good idea. Amita should come with us, yes?&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Ridiculous. It is impossible! You are only good at talking nonsense!&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Amita&#x2019;s eyes narrowed as they bellowed. However, Daphne, who had become familiar with Amita after two days, didn&#x2019;t even blink. Her expression suddenly became upset and she said in a sad voice,</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;I would like to be with Amita. Does Amita not want to?&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Although it was an obvious attack, it was a highly effective one.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">In-gong and Silvan looked on with anticipation and Amita&#x2019;s reaction was just like they had expected.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Well, that isn&#x2019;t it...&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">It was only half-way. So, Felicia approached Amita quickly.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Amita, I also want to be with Amita longer. How about Caitlin?&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;Yes, that... No, Amita is amazing.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Caitlin&#x2019;s &#x2018;amazing&#x2019; also had great effect as Amita then grabbed their chest and flinched.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">However, Amita was stubborn and persuading them wasn&#x2019;t easy. They jumped down from Daphne&#x2019;s arms and cried out,</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Aish! I won&#x2019;t! I won&#x2019;t be deceived!&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">It was a fairly decisive attitude, but Daphne just sighed and changed tactics.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Amita, didn&#x2019;t you say that you wanted to tinker with 9th Prince&#x2019;s equipment?&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;Huh? Daphne, what are you talking about?&quot;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">In-gong asked with amazement. Daphne then replied in a calm tone,</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;It is obviously good, but it hasn&#x2019;t been adjusted yet. Amita wanted to adjust the equipment to fit 9th Prince.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">She was referring to the equipment belonging to elder dragons.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">In-gong looked hurriedly at Amita.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;Amita?&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;Ohh, I still won&#x2019;t do it!&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Handling equipment from elder dragons was a pretty big temptation for Amita.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">In-gong looked down at Amita, then said suddenly,</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Please wait a moment.&quot;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">In-gong headed inside the temple. Then some time passed.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">As soon as In-gong returned through the entrance of the temple, Amita jumped up. Their face was startled as they glanced inside the temple and cried out,</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Heok? Really?&quot;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Of course, there was no answer, but Amita heard something. Their shoulders sagged and they breathed a long sigh. Then they looked angrily at In-gong.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;You! What did you do to the last flame? Why did the last flame tell me to follow you?&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Amota&#x2019;s tail pounded on the ground.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">In-gong just laughed with a relaxed face and said to Amita,</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;So, are you going with us?&quot;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;Ohhh... it can&#x2019;t be helped.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">It was the command of the last flame.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Amita disguised themselves as the user or manager of the last flame, but they were actually in a position of worship.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Amita sighed and spoke again,</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;The last flame must be ready to move, so it is impossible right now. The separation isn&#x2019;t yet complete.
