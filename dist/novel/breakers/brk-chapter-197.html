<p><span>Chapter 197 - Chapter 41: Discovery #3</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p><p><span>It was impossible to have a crowded banquet now that Sky Forest and the palace had suffered due to the fairy king.&#xA0;</span><span>However, it was also impossible to let the party that saved Sky Forest leave without anything.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>So, after Sylvia finished her conversation with the sword duke, she set up a small party. It was to compensate for the situation with Sky Forest and show that Sylvia was fine after collapsing.&#xA0;</span><span>Due to it being a small banquet, the participants were simple: the children of the demon king; their aides; and the queen.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>The dark elves emphasized an atmosphere which was just as free as their clothing, so the formalities of the banquet were virtually nonexistent. Since it was such a small banquet, they were able to lie down while eating and drinking.&#xA0;</span><span>After a few drinks, the atmosphere naturally turned boisterous. The loudest ones were those gathered in the middle of the banquet hall.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Higher! Higher! Higher!&#x201D;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>It wasn&#x2019;t the sword duke throwing Felicia toward the ceiling. It was a drunk In-gong.&#xA0;</span><span>The person who did it was different, so the response of the recipient was different. Felicia, like In-gong, had red cheeks from the alcohol as she burst into laughter.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Kyaaah~&#x201D;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>She screamed, but it was a very pleased one. Caitlin, who was following Felicia&#x2019;s movements between the ceiling and Shutra&#x2019;s hands, tugged at In-gong&#x2019;s clothes.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Me too! Me as well, Shutra!&#x201D;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>Caitlin was also drunk. Her pale cheeks were red, and her golden eyes were out of focus.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>Under normal circumstances, he would stop throwing Felicia or have Caitlin wait a while, but both In-gong and Caitlin were drunk. In-gong turned to Caitlin and nodded. He stretched out his hand and threw Caitlin toward the ceiling.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>Felicia and Caitlin alternated between the ceiling and In-gong&#x2019;s hands. It looked like he was juggling them.&#xA0;</span><span>Felicia and Caitlin screamed with pleasure. Most of those watching had smiles on their faces, except for a few people.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Somehow, don&#x2019;t they react differently from when I do it?&#x201D;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>The sword duke complained while drinking. Chris, who was sitting next to him, shrugged and replied,&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Sword Duke, it is the same for anyone else, so you don&#x2019;t have to worry.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Felicia! Let Oppa do it!&#x201D;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Ah, come on!&#x201D;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>The sword duke watched Silvan try to grab Felicia, and he nodded with a convinced expression.</span></p><p><span>&quot;Yes, indeed.&quot;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>The sword duke nodded a few more times before turning his attention elsewhere. Caitlin&#x2019;s and Felicia&#x2019;s aides, who should be watching them, were talking to someone else. It was In-gong&#x2019;s aide, Carack.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>The sword duke found the sight of an orc being surrounded by a beautiful dark elf, a lycanthrope, and a satyr ridiculous. Then he turned his gaze elsewhere once again. Sylvia, queen of the dark elves and 3rd queen of the Demon King&#x2019;s Palace, was lying down sideways.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>Sylvia was lying down on a stack of cloth and smoking a cigarette, while Amita was fidgeting in front of her. It seemed like they were doing business.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>Looking at the two people carefully, the sword duke asked Chris again,&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Prince, do you know why Amita is like that?&#x201D;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&quot;They have a weak character that fell to temptation.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Indeed.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>The sword duke nodded and focused on the conversation between Sylvia and Amita. The two people&#x2019;s voices could be heard clearly in the noisy surroundings.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&quot;I understand! I&#x2019;ll make it! So, will you give me half?&#x201D;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>Amita waved their hands, while Sylvia cocked her head and pretended not to know.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Hrmmm, well. Can I ask you to make me a few sacks?&#x201D;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Three sacks! Three sacks of weapons if you give me half a bottle!&#x201D;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Omo, didn&#x2019;t I say it was five sacks?&#x201D;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>Sylvia blinked as she raised a hand to her cheek, looking truly bewitching yet innocent.&#xA0;</span><span>Amita was silent for a moment, but they soon accepted as their tail banged against the ground.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Eeeh...! I understand! Five sacks! No more beyond that!&#x201D;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Okay. It&apos;s a deal.&quot;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>Thanks to Silvan and Felicia, Sylvia was well aware of Amita&#x2019;s value. Gaining five sacks of Amita&#x2019;s equipment for half a bottle of wine was a good deal.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Hmm, I am curious. What flavour does this have that Amita is so enthusiastic?&quot;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>Sylvia put out the cigarette in her hand and opened the lid of the bottle containing the Heavenly Wine. As the lid opened, a fragrant smell emerged and those nearby turned to Sylvia without knowing.&#xA0;</span><span>Sylvia was shocked and took a sip like she was spellbound. Her world changed with one sip.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Ahh&#x2026; ah...&#x201D;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>In-gong had created this by mixing an elixir and the Heavenly Wine. Sylvia closed her eyes and moaned, then she sighed and moaned again. She barely regained her mind after a few sips and said,&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Amita, I take back that contract.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Such a thing! This is a violation of the contract! A violation of the contract!&#x201D;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>Amita gulped as Sylvia took another sip, but Sylvia didn&#x2019;t care. She got up from her seat and approached In-gong.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Shutra, can you give me just one more bottle?&#x201D;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>In-gong flinched at her coy voice. She looked exactly like Felicia as she embraced him, so In-gong couldn&#x2019;t resist. Moreover, it was Sylvia who was asking. She had given him the fairy, so he should give her another bottle.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;I-I will.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Me too! Me too!&#x201D;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>Amita ran over and made a fuss after seeing him give a bottle to Sylvia so easily. The sword duke watched this scene and shook his head.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&quot;The delicious prince is really great.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>Although the sword duke had never tasted the Heavenly Wind made by In-gong, he knew about it. Then Chris asked him quietly,&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Sword Duke, are all gandharva like this?&#x201D;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&quot;As far as I know, only Prince is like this among the gandharva. The scents of the other gandharva aren&#x2019;t to this extent.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>The sword duke recalled 5th Queen Semita Ignus. She always had a good scent around her.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>Chris looked briefly at the sword duke before turning his gaze back to the front again. Then he asked casually,&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Are the gandharva healthy?&#x201D;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>In-gong was the only gandharva Chris had met. There were rumours that those inside the confined area had died.&#xA0;</span><span>The sword duke didn&#x2019;t look at Chris. He just filled up a new glass.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;They are alive and well. At least when I visited them a year ago.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>Chris&#x2019; eyes narrowed.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Sword Duke, is there any possibility that the gandharvas can be released?&#x201D;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&quot;It is up to the demon king. Just... it might be harder now.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>In-gong had gained divinity, proving that the gandharvas&#x2019; experiment was a success.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Sword Duke?&#x201D;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&quot;I am saying too much. We&#x2019;ll just have to see what happens.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>The sword duke set down his glass, stood up and took a step forward. He walked slowly, but it was like he was merging with the wind without even thinking about it.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>Chris stared at the spot where the sword duke had been, then he turned his gaze to In-gong.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&amp; &#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Shutra is amazing! Shutra is delicious! Hehehe.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>The drunk Caitlin said while hiccuping. She looked very cute, but In-gong&#x2019;s expression was different as he walked next to Chris who was carrying Caitlin on his back.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Be careful not to get eaten in your sleep.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;I&#x2019;m glad that Caitlin noona can&#x2019;t transform.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>In-gong nodded at the sincere advice. If Caitlin could turn into a wolf like Seira or Elaine, then he would&#x2019;ve already been eaten when she bit his finger.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Ang, ang.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>Caitlin smiled as she heard them talking and pretending to bite the air.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Well, I really hope you don&#x2019;t get eaten.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Yes.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>It seemed like the two of them were speaking to reassure themselves.&#xA0;</span><span>Chris arrived in front of Caitlin&#x2019;s room and opened the door. It couldn&#x2019;t be helped because Seira had been missing since the banquet.&#xA0;</span><span>At any other time, Chris would&#x2019;ve scolded Seira, but today was a special day. From the outset, they had been given permission to drink as much as they wanted.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>Instead of entered the room, Chris held the doorknob for a while. He looked at In-gong and said,&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Shutra.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Huh?&#x201D;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>In-gong turned to Chris. However, Chris didn&#x2019;t say anything. Instead, he licked his lips a few times before shaking his head.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Nothing. Good night.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Hyung?&#x201D;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Go.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>Chris smiled and stroked In-gong&#x2019;s head roughly before entering the room. Although In-gong had grown a lot this year, this was possible because he was still shorter than Chris.&#xA0;</span><span>Was Chris trying to say something?&#xA0;</span><span>Instead of thinking deeply, In-gong returned to his room. If there was something he needed to know, Chris would tell him eventually.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>Apart from Seira, Carack was also missing. He could&#x2019;ve called a dark elf maid, but In-gong entered his room alone.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>It was a strange feeling. Although he was nervous about joining Zephyr, at present, he was relaxed without any worries. This was why people drank alcohol.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&#x2018;Let&#x2019;s take a look at my stats.&#x2019;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>In-gong opened his status window and looked at the details. All his stats were over 100 points.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&#x2018;There are a lot.&#x2019;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>His main occupation was Protagonist, but he also had the Dragon Warrior and Conquest Knight as secondary occupations. Thanks to Spiritualism, other specifics had been added.&#xA0;</span><span>There were many special racial skills.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&apos;Well, I need to maintain aura, magic power, and divine power.&#x2019;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>Thanks to receiving the divinity of the gandharva, his divine power had reached a certain level. There was only one power left.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span> &#x2018;There is nothing else to do.&#x2019;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>In-gong leisurely started searching through the status windows of his knights and activated several windows to see their various stats.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&#x2018;I haven&#x2019;t paid much attention to this.&#x2019;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>He often saw Carack and Green Wind&#x2019;s status windows since they fought together quite often, but he had never really looked at Caitlin&#x2019;s or Silvan&#x2019;s after they joined the first time.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&apos;Well, they all have significant stats.&#x2019;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>This was as expected from the children of the demon king. It might be due to In-gong&#x2019;s influence, but all of them had higher stats compared to their versions in Knight Saga.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&#x2018;It is just like how Zephyr is several times stronger compared to the Zephyr in Knight Saga.&#x2019;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>Indeed, In-gong would be able to see how strong he was during the next mission.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;And... huh?&#x201D;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>In-gong&#x2019;s eyes suddenly widened as he searched the status windows. It was because his eyes went to a part he hadn&#x2019;t paid much attention to until now.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>[Name: Caitlin]&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>[Species: Lycanthrope/Sura Mix]&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>This was an obvious notation. It wasn&#x2019;t strange. However, In-gong felt uncomfortable.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>[Name: Silvan]&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>[Species: Dark Elf/Sura Mix]&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>He looked through his memories. It was only recently that the details such as age or species were listed in the status windows of the knights. He hadn&#x2019;t seen these details when he went to rescue Anastasia.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&#x2018;No, no.&#x2019;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>The cause of his discomfort was elsewhere. It wasn&#x2019;t because of new details.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>[Name: Felicia]&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>[Species: Dark Elf/Sura Mix]&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>[Name: Carack]&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>[Species: Orc]&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>[Name: Karma]&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>[Species: Satyr]&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>In-gong activated his status window hurriedly.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>[Name: Shutra Ignus]&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>[Species: Divine Humanoid Gandharva]&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>In-gong blinked. He took a deep breath and thought about it.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>This wasn&#x2019;t because he was reborn as a divine humanoid. Previously, In-gong had &#x2018;gandharva&#x2019; stated in that spot as his species.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>He wondered why he wasn&#x2019;t a mix like the others. Why wasn&#x2019;t &#x2018;sura&#x2019; written there like the other children of the demon king? Caitlin, who wasn&#x2019;t a child of the demon king, was also marked as mixed. In other words, a first generation mixed blood was indicated.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>Then something popped into his head.&#xA0;</span><span>In-gong stood up at the thought. It explained why his status window only stated one species.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&#x2018;A sin big enough to confine all the gandharva.&#x2019;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>Shutra wasn&#x2019;t the child of the demon king. He didn&#x2019;t have the blood of the demon king.&#xA0;</span><span>It was baffling. This was an unexpected secret of his birth. However, if it was true, Shutra truly wasn&#x2019;t a child of the demon king.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>Did the demon king know this?&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&#x2018;He knows.&#x2019;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>He remembered when he met the demon king. The demon king had called In-gong the child of 5th Queen Semita. He had never once called In-gong his own child.&#xA0;</span><span>Moreover, if the sin of the gandharva really involved Shutra&#x2019;s birth, then their punishment meant the demon king knew the truth.&#xA0;</span><span>However, he didn&#x2019;t know why the demon king accepted Shutra&#x2019;s presence. Moreover, why had he given In-gong the Seed of Extreme Nothingness?&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Shutra? Are you there?&#x201D;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>He heard a voice outside the door.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>It was Felicia&#x2019;s voice.&#xA0;</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p>
