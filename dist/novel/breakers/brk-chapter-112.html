<p><strong>Chapter 112 Chapter 18: Auction #4.</strong></p><div id="chapterContent" class="innerContent fr-view"><p></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Chapter 112 - Chapter 18: Auction #4</span></p><hr><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">The location of Evian was similar to the Demon King&#x2019;s Palace.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Evian, one of the peripheries of the Demon World, was at the east boundary. East of Evian was a place that would be called the Eastern Limit Line. Beyond that were the barbarians who chose to stay outside the Demon World instead of succumbing to the reign of the Demon King&#x2019;s Palace.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">It wasn&#x2019;t just the location and seasons that determined the climate of the Demon World; there were some mysterious and wonderful elements due to the flow of magic power throughout the area.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Evian was a winter land all year round. As a result, it was virtually barren and the barbarians wandering beyond the Eastern Limit Line made it a difficult place to live.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">However, it wasn&#x2019;t a land that the Demon King&#x2019;s Palace could leave alone. It wasn&#x2019;t possible to give the land to the barbarians who wouldn&#x2019;t submit to the Demon King&#x2019;s Palace.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">The areas around Evian weren&#x2019;t very hospitable either. Basic laws existed in the Demon World, but there were no such rules around Evian.&#xA0;</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">It was obviously a messed-up land with outlaws like Mad Dog Jiks running around. Takar was located near Evian and used this confusion to its advantage. Being a lawless zone meant that regulations and controls were weak.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Takar exploited this fact to become a pleasure ground. Things that would be done underground in other places were openly committed on the streets of Takar in broad daylight.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Takar paid a fair amount of taxes to the Demon King&#x2019;s Palace and the Demon King&#x2019;s Palace tolerated the existence of Takar instead of getting rid of them.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">In-gong looked at the mini-map and thought about the movement route of the party. There were two main ways to get to Evian Fortress, the ultimate destination of the party. One was via Takar, while the other was moving in a straight line towards Evian.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x2018;I need to go to Takar.&#x2019;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">It was ridiculous to stay for very long since they were heading for a mission. There was a limit to stopping for a while.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x2018;I can use the excuse if liquidating my assets that I thought of the other day.&#x2019;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">In-gong slowly nodded and looked at Felicia.&#xA0;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;Excuse me, Noona.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Felicia, who had entered her sleeping bag early, stretched out her head at In-gong&#x2019;s call. Her eyes were full of mischief.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;What? Do you want to go to Takar?&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">It was a teasing tone, not cold. In-gong took a deep breath and opened his mouth.&#xA0;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;I think it would be good to cash in the treasures I gained in the dungeons.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Hmm, I see.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Felicia&#x2019;s eyes were full of laughter. As In-gong blushed without knowing it, she kept laughing.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Yes, we should go with Shutra. I&#x2019;ve decided that the meeting place is Takar.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Meeting place?&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Yes, aren&#x2019;t the lycanthropes also coming to Takar?&#x201D;&#xA0;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Felicia turned her head to the side and asked. The target of her last question was Caitlin, not In-gong. Caitlin, who was sitting in a comfortable position and circulating her aura, gently nodded.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;That&#x2019;s right. It&#x2019;s because Shutra wanted to go there.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Unlike Felicia, there was a little bit of distaste in her tone as she finished talking and stared at In-gong.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Felicia laughed as if she found Caitlin funny and spoke to In-gong again.&#xA0;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;I&#x2019;ve coordinated it in advance. This is a military mission so it is a good idea to bring some troops as support. The support troops have been preparing for a week already.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">In Knight Saga, there were always reinforcements from draconians during military missions. Even during the Red Lightning Tribe mission, Chris and Caitlin had more than 100 lycanthropes with them. It was natural for there to be reinforcements.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;The reinforcements can&#x2019;t use the same transportation formation as ours since their departure location isn&#x2019;t the Demon King&#x2019;s Palace. So they have to find one of the nearby transport formations, and there is a pretty big one in the vicinity of Takar. So the meeting place is there.&quot;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Felicia winked at the end of her words. It was already decided that they would meet at Takar before leaving the Demon King&#x2019;s Palace, yet she still became irritated when In-gong said he wanted to go to Takar.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Felicia just laughed at In-gong&#x2019;s expression. He took a deep breath as Felicia spoke again.&#xA0;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Shutra, there is something else... the dark elves will be coming as well. So I mean...&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Felicia hesitated as she studied In-gong&#x2019;s face. Despite the military mission, In-gong couldn&#x2019;t receive any support from the gandharva. Felicia and Caitlin both received reinforcements while In-gong had none. Instead of being upset like Felicia thought, In-gong just smiled pleasantly.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;I&#x2019;m fine. Thank you for taking care of me. In addition, I can think of them as my own due to Noona.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Apart from being in the same faction, this was Felicia, it wasn&#x2019;t like she was a stranger. Felicia&#x2019;s face turned lively again at In-gong&#x2019;s words.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Isn&apos;t it?&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;It is the same with the lycanthropes.&#x201D; Caitlin quickly added. His greatest allies were probably Chris and the lycanthropes, since he hadn&#x2019;t met with the queen of the dark elves yet, so he just smiled at Caitlin.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Felicia giggled at Caitlin&#x2019;s interruption and spread out her fan.&#xA0;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Well, we will be able to explore it properly. The meeting place is at Takar but it will take a day or two.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Princess, why does it seem like you want to go more than Prince?&#x201D;&#xA0;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">The quietly listening Carack asked and Felicia just shrugged with a cheeky expression.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Well, the auction house will be fun.&#x201D; Caitlin, don&#x2019;t you think it will be fun?&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Unni has been to Takar before?&#x201D;&#xA0;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Caitlin was immediately interested. Felicia nodded and tapped her fan against Caitlin&#x2019;s shoulder.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;I&#x2019;ve already been a few times. So there is no need for a guide. The city won&#x2019;t meet Shutra&#x2019;s expectations.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;E-excuse me?&#x201D;&#xA0;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">In-gong muttered, but Felicia pretended not to hear him and looked over at Amita.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;It will also be interesting for Amita.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;Hmm, that noisy and busy place is too annoying.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Amita said in a rough voice as they pounded their tail against the ground. They were holding a large jewel in their hand and carving a complicated magic pattern on it.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Talking raccoon, is the tuning still not finished?&#x201D;&#xA0;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Green Wind appeared behind In-gong and asked.&#xA0;</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">It had obviously been over a day since they left the Demon King&#x2019;s Palace but the readjustment still wasn&#x2019;t completed. Thanks to that, In-gong was forced to use an Earth Quaker that wasn&#x2019;t finished yet.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Amita looked at Green Wind with grim eyes before pounding their tail again. &#x201C;Of course it takes a long time without a workshop!&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Amita took a deep breath before speaking to In-gong. &quot;But it will be finished by the end of tomorrow. So don&#x2019;t worry. It will definitely be finished before we arrive in Evian.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">From the appearance, it seemed like the last task was carving the jewel and inserting it. Felicia reached out to Amita and said in a humble voice,&#xA0;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Amita, don&#x2019;t be offended. I will buy you whatever you want in Takar.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;Bah, do you think that I&#x2019;m a child? Don&#x2019;t think that I will be relieved by such a thing.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Then why was their tail waving?</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Felicia held back her laughter as she looked over at In-gong who nodded. Caitlin, Carack and the rest of the group also laughed with their eyes, not saying anything out loud.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">However, there was one person in the party who was unaware of this.&#xA0;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Talking raccoon, your tail is waving.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Amita quickly stopped moving their tail at Green Wind&#x2019;s words, and In-gong made Green Wind turn off her solid state.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&amp;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Takar, the city of pleasure, was divided into two major districts by a central wall. The poor entertainment area was outside the walls while the safe and colourful entertainments were inside the walls.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Outside the walls, the outlaws from around Evian gathered since the security was bad. Sword fights often took place in the gambling halls, the entertainment was in the streets and there were many large and small battles. Many forbidden items in the Demon World were openly sold by streets vendors.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Obviously, Felicia had visited Takar several times, but she&#x2019;d been inside the wall, not outside.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Felicia headed straight down a relatively safe central road and talked to a gate guard. A few minutes later, a well-dressed man appeared to lead the party to a VIP place.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">The place where they were guided had large rooms filled with brilliant colour. It was obviously a house to be rented out since there were several rooms. After unpacking and having a light rest, Felicia grabbed Caitlin and said to In-gong.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Go with Carack. I&apos;ll go shopping with Caitlin. Amita, do you want to go with us?&#x201D;&#xA0;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Instead of answering Felicia&#x2019;s question, Amita jumped into Daphne&#x2019;s arms. Daphne had a perplexed expression as she nodded on Amita&#x2019;s behalf.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Felicia smiled before turning to Carack who was standing beside In-gong.&#xA0;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Carack, I&#x2019;ll ask you to control him.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Leave it to me.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Carack hit his chest with his fist. In-gong just sighed.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;What do you think I&#x2019;m going to do?&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;I guess we&#x2019;ll see?&#x201D;&#xA0;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Felicia laughed while Caitlin sent a &#x2018;hrmmm&#x2019; look towards In-gong.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Felicia spoke again.&#xA0;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Let&#x2019;s meet in the afternoon. We need to participate in the auction at night, so be sure to come back before then.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Felicia finished and left with Amita and the other females first. The guide soldier had gone to meet the reinforcements so there was only In-gong and Carack left.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">In-gong took a deep breath and said to Carack.&#xA0;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Okay, then let&#x2019;s go to the slave market.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">He would be able to get rumours about Nayatra&#x2019;s whereabouts from there.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Carack&#x2019;s eyes widened at In-gong&#x2019;s words.&#xA0;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Huh? Are you really interested in the slave market?&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;I&apos;m not interested. I have to check something.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Um, I understand.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Carack nodded with a serious expression. Carack was really a good aide for In-gong. In-gong left the hotel with Carack and looked at several slave shops nearby. However, he didn&#x2019;t find anything.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;There is no slave called Nayatra.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">He thought she might be using another name so he looked through the catalog of succubus slaves, but there was nothing.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x2018;It is reasonable.&#x2019;&#xA0;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">In Knight Saga, Zephyr had met Nayatra at the end of Year 513. This was Year 512 so there was a one year difference.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&apos;Should I take the next chance?&#x2019;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">In-gong entered the last slave shop with a face full of regrets.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Carack was looking at In-gong with a mixture of warmth and doubts, while In-gong searched through the succubus slaves. Instead of making fun or teasing In-gong, Carack asked with a serious expression.&#xA0;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Is the succubus called Nayatra that important to Prince?&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;She is important.&quot;&#xA0;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">It wasn&#x2019;t just because Nayatra was his subordinate in Knight Saga. She was the key to the lycanthrope subjugation.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Carack narrowed his eyes and asked.&#xA0;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Well, Prince. Can you tell me what she looks like? I can ask the slave dealer. Once she comes in, the slave dealer can contact us.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;The method isn&#x2019;t bad.&quot;&#xA0;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Nayatra had appeared in the slave auction one year later, so it was likely that she would be in Takar within the next few months.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">In-gong described what he remembered.&#xA0;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Her hair is pink. Her face is beautiful, even as a succubus... a bit like Flora. I mean, the atmosphere. She has a cool personality like Flora. And there are two yellow horns on her head. Her height is like Felicia noona? Her skin is as white as Caitlin noona&#x2019;s and her eyes are blue...&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Does she wear her hair in a ponytail? The ponytail is long enough to reach her hips.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Carack interrupted his description. In-gong&#x2019;s eyes widened.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;That&#x2019;s right, how did you know?&#x201D;&#xA0;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Instead of answering, Carack pointed to a female talking to the slave dealer. She wasn&#x2019;t a slave but a customer who came to buy a slave.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">And In-gong knew her name.&#xA0;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&apos;Nayatra?&#x2019;&#xA0;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">The succubus Nayatra who appeared in the slave auction in one year.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Except right now, she wasn&#x2019;t a slave.</span></p><hr><p></p><p></p></div><p></p>
