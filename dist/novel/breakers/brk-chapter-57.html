Ainkel&#x2019;s magic power which had been kept for a thousand years!</p><p>Dragon Blood, which had already been in play, became even more powerful. A brilliant green light shone from White Eagle, where it rested on In-gong&#x2019;s left arm, and there was a roar from Earth Quaker on his right arm.</p><p>Life and destruction...</p><p>The power of Watcher Ainkel and the Great Enkidu!</p><p>Balkarova felt an instinctive fear. He was surprised at the unexpected power of life and moved backwards. Then he regained his mentality, looked at In-gong and suddenly pulled up the purple aura.</p><p>Breath weapon.</p><p>In-gong knew what Balkarova was doing. Instead of avoiding it, In-gong swung his left arm the moment the purple pillar poured out from Balkarova&#x2019;s mouth.</p><p>&quot;Prince!&#x201D;</p><p>Carack shouted and Felicia also gave a short scream. Ferocious Eyes tried to raise his body while coughing up blood.</p><p>White Eagle flashed.</p><p><em>Kwaaaaaang!</em></p><p>There was a roar and the purple aura spread everywhere. White Eagle left In-gong&#x2019;s left arm and blocked the violet pillar. The white metal pieces spread out like wings and emitted a green light. After colliding with White Eagle, the purple aura was broken and scattered.</p><p>However, Balkarova didn&#x2019;t back off. Once again, he poured out an overwhelming amount of purple aura. In the midst of breaking and scattering, the purple pillar had become thicker and more intense.</p><p>In-gong didn&#x2019;t wait. He moved to the side.</p><p>White Eagle was still confronting the purple aura, so Balkarovan was confused by In-gong moving and leaving White Eagle by itself.</p><p>When he thought about it, he realised it was natural as In-gong wasn&#x2019;t holding onto White Eagle. White Eagle floated to the side and blocked the purple pillar. There was no reason for In-gong to stand behind White Eagle.</p><p>Balkarova couldn&#x2019;t conceal his agitation and hurriedly chased In-gong&#x2019;s movements with the purple pillar.</p><p>However, In-gong&#x2019;s movements were too fast to chase using that method. In-gong moved and circled behind Balkarova.</p><p>&#x201C;Kuha!&#x201D;</p><p>Balkarova gathered the purple aura hurriedly. It was painful because he was gathering it too hastily, but he didn&#x2019;t stop. He turned and aimed his left hand at In-gong. Fireballs poured out from Balkarova&#x2019;s five fingers.</p><p><em>Kwang!</em> <em>Kwang!</em> <em>Kwang!</em></p><p>The fireballs exploded, causing a deafening roar, but In-gong wasn&#x2019;t there anymore. In-gong had merely appeared at Balkarova&#x2019;s back before moving away while continuing to watch him. Meanwhile, a white aura was gathering on In-gong&#x2019;s right arm in preparation for Gigantic Piston.</p><p>Balkarova was very angry. He raised his sword and rushed toward In-gong with a momentum akin to a crashing car.</p><p>In-gong breathed in deeply. He was sweating, but he stood there and concentrated on Balkarova&#x2019;s movements. It was meaningless to move too early. Just as In-gong was looking at Balkarova, Balkarova was also looking at In-gong. It was like a bullfighter dealing with a raging bull at the appropriate moment.</p><p>The black sword Balkarova swung poured out lightning bolts. At that moment, In-gong moved. He ran to the front without fleeing backwards or sideways. He took a few steps to the side to avoid Balkarova&#x2019;s attacks and passed by Balkarova. In-gong focused patiently on Balkarova&#x2019;s movements until the end. He was capable of this due to the explosive speed of Beast Authority.</p><p>In-gong counted inwardly. Not only did he gather his aura on Earth Quaker, he also used the remaining powers he had left within him.</p><p>There was the spirit of life that Daphne&#x2019;s blessing had allowed to dwell inside him.</p><p>There was also Ainkel&#x2019;s magic power which contained the power of life.</p><p>He used both of them. Rather than pushing them onto Earth Quaker, which had the power of destruction, he circled the power around its surface.</p><p>This formed a white ring.</p><p>After putting on the power of life, it acted as a sharp trial for Earth Quaker. It was an unstable power, but In-gong didn&#x2019;t mind. He turned around, swung his left arm widely and White Eagle started flying again at In-gong&#x2019;s command.</p><p><em>Kakakang!</em></p><p>White Eagle flew over Balkarova&#x2019;s head. The white metal collided with the purple aura and Balkarova staggered.</p><p>It was truly a trampling!</p><p>&#x201C;Kiaaaaaah!&#x201D;</p><p>Unable to bear the anger, Balkarova swung his left hand at random and shot out fireballs again, while swinging his sword with his right hand.</p><p>Meanwhile, In-gong focused only on evasion. White Eagle flew to In-gong&#x2019;s side and blocked the spheres of flames while In-gong rolled to the ground to avoid the blade.</p><p>Balkarova tried to pursue In-gong, but he couldn&#x2019;t. Balkarova and In-gong weren&#x2019;t the only ones in this area!</p><p>&#x201C;Kuraha!&#x201D;</p><p>Fury had narrowed Balkarova&#x2019;s field of view and at that moment, Carack struck Balkarova in the shins with his axe which contained the power of an earth spirit. There was only a metallic ringing, but it was worth it. Carack&#x2019;s only aim was to draw Balkarova&#x2019;s attention away from In-gong.</p><p>&#x201C;Kuha!&#x201D;</p><p>Balkarova swung his left hand toward Carack. So far, Carack had dodged the attack, but he couldn&#x2019;t this time. Exposed to Balkarova&#x2019;s power, Carack was pushed back dozens of meters.</p><p>Despite the fact that it was only one blow, blood poured from his mouth and he stiffened from the purple aura. However, Carack didn&#x2019;t care. He saw Balkarova was still running toward In-gong and raised his upper body while coughing up blood. He shouted for his king.</p><p>&quot;Karaha!&quot;</p><p>In-gong responded to the battle cry. Previously, he had devoted everything toward evasion. However, now, In-gong ran straight toward Balkarova, who then used his breath weapon in desperation. White Eagle swirled around In-gong and defended him. Once again, the green and purple lights clashed and there was a deafening howl.</p><p><em>Kwang!</em></p><p>In-gong kept moving forward. Divine Beast Authority, which contained a brilliant explosive force, was used to compress the distance between In-gong and Balkarova.</p><p>Balkarova was approximately five meters tall. It wasn&#x2019;t easy to aim for his head or upper body because the height difference was too big. At this moment, Balkarova instinctively sensed something; he had to prevent In-gong&#x2019;s strike. He couldn&#x2019;t permit himself to be hit by the power contained in the gauntlet!</p><p>Balkarova raised his sword, but it wasn&#x2019;t for an attack. It was to protect his important upper body and head.</p><p>However, In-gong didn&#x2019;t jump forward. He aimed at Balkarova&#x2019;s legs like he had been doing so far.</p><p>Gigantic Piston screamed as it emerged.</p><p>It wasn&#x2019;t necessarily a frontal strike.</p><p>He aimed from below.</p><p>In-gong stopped right in front of Balkarova and punched the air with his fist. He couldn&#x2019;t strike Balkarova directly, but it was enough. The mass of white aura clung to Balkarova as he was swept away by the force of Gigantic Piston.</p><p>&quot;Kiaah!&#x201D;</p><p>With that, Balkarova&#x2019;s breastplate was shattered. Balkarova stepped back from the force of Gigantic Piston and the power of life took off the purple aura enveloping his upper body. It was only for a short time, but as a result, Balkarova&#x2019;s upper body was left defenseless for a while. It was right at this moment!</p><p>&#x201C;Felicia!&#x201D;</p><p>&quot;Triple Blast!&#x201D;</p><p>Felicia shouted the moment that In-gong cried out. A tricolour ray of light shot out once again from his outstretched hands.</p><p>There had been no promises. In-gong had simply believed in Felicia. He believed she wouldn&#x2019;t have given up and that she would find some way to win while watching the fight. She was a dark elf, Felicia Doomblade of Knight Saga!</p><p><em>Kwaaaaaang!</em></p><p>The blue, red and yellow light penetrated Balkarova&#x2019;s chest. There was a huge roar and hundreds of bone fragments flew everywhere. Balkarova&#x2019;s body cracked and a purple aura emerged from his eyes and mouth. It wasn&#x2019;t an attack. It was the release of the aura as Balkarova could no longer control it.</p><p>Felicia, who had prepared Triple Blast while In-gong prepared Gigantic Piston, didn&#x2019;t stop the eruption of her magic power. Using Triple Blast, not just once but twice, was painful for her.</p><p>Blood flowed down her jaws and tiny blood vessels in her arms burst, causing many bruises to form.</p><p>However, Felicia just smiled. She swallowed the pain and finished the magic.</p><p>Kwakwang!</p><p>The tricolor light exploded. Balkarova&#x2019;s bone armour was shattered and the aura that had surrounded him could no longer be seen.</p><p>However, Balkarova hadn&#x2019;t died yet. Instead of collapsing, he used the last of his power to lift his sword.</p><p>In-gong raised his left arm instead of avoiding it. There was no need for a command as In-gong wasn&#x2019;t alone in this moment.</p><p>&#x2018;Master!&#x2019;</p><p>White Eagle struck Balkarova&#x2019;s head and Balkarova started to crumble. White Eagle then turned in the air and landed on In-gong&#x2019;s left arm, just like a hawk landing on a hunter&#x2019;s arm.</p><p>That wasn&#x2019;t all.</p><p>Balkarova&#x2019;s knee was broken and Balkarova literally crumbled to pieces. The skeleton knights dealing with the centaurs also returned to death with terrible screams.</p><p>Ferocious Eyes looked at In-gong and chanted Green Wind&#x2019;s name, while Karma embraced Daphne with a silly smile.</p><p>Delia helped support Felicia and Felicia leaned on Delia, expressing both pain and joy.</p><p>Despite the blood, Carack laughed.</p><p>Hearing a familiar voice, In-gong was pleased.</p><p>[Your level has risen.]</p><p>[Your level has risen.]</p><p>[Boss: Skeleton King Balkarova has been defeated.]</p><p>[Title: King Slayer Lv1 has been acquired.]</p><p>Level 19.</p><p>In-gong breathed out and a white light wrapped around him as Felicia released the flame barrier.</p><p>The master of the purple aura had died, so the monsters started scattering.</p><p>&amp;</p><p>&apos;Hmm, I am prepared. Now is the time for praise, Master.&#x2019;</p><hr><p><br></p></div><p><br></p>
