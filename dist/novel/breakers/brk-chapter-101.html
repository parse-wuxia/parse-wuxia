I am 5th Prince, Silvan Doomblade.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;It is great to see you, Silvan. How have you been?&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Silvan and Elaine greeted each other with smiles. Silvan, who had always been flamboyant, talked formally without any signs of discomfort, but Elaine seemed different.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">It wasn&#x2019;t that Elaine&#x2019;s courtesy or behaviour was a problem. It was simply that her image was different from what In-gong had seen before.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Now, Elaine was literally a lady. She had Caitlin&#x2019;s innocent appearance, but her sophistication and subdued voice created a beautiful atmosphere.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Moreover, she spoke with honorifics. She hadn&#x2019;t done that when In-gong met her last time.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">However, despite from In-gong&#x2019;s surprise, Elaine and Silvan maintained an aristocratic attitude toward each other.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Thank you for your concern.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Silvan bowed and stepped back. This time, Felicia was the one to step forward and bow.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;6th Princess Felicia Doomblade greets the 4th Queen.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Just like Elaine, Felicia acted as a delicate lady. Unlike the usually energetic Felicia, she showed a very gentle appearance.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Elaine said with a smile,</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;You seem to have become more beautiful in just a few days. I was worried due to the disturbance in Spider Forest.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Karma had asked for help from the lycanthrope rangers. It was natural for Elaine, the queen of the lycanthropes, to receive the news.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Felicia gazed downward slightly.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Thank you for the active support from the lycanthropes. The guardian of Spider Forest asked me to thank you as well.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">In fact, they hadn&#x2019;t received any help during the fight at Spider Forest, but the lycanthropes had still moved to aid them. &#xA0;Moreover, the lycanthrope rangers had agreed to watch the state of Spider Forest for a while, so it was right to express gratitude.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Elaine responded in a very friendly tone,</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;You are my children as well. So, it is a normal course of action.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">They didn&#x2019;t share a single drop of blood, but Elaine viewed them as children of the family.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Felicia stepped back while hiding her embarrassment and vigilance. Then it was Caitlin&#x2019;s turn.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;I&#x2019;m back, Mother.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Elaine didn&#x2019;t respond to the light greeting. It was like she couldn&#x2019;t hear Caitlin&#x2019;s words at all.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Caitlin bit her lip and bowed.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;8th Princess Caitlin Moonlight greets the 4th Queen.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;I&#x2019;m glad to see you&#x2019;ve come back safely.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Elaine smiled widely and accepted the greeting. Caitlin looked like she wanted a hug ,but Elaine didn&#x2019;t allow it. She turned her head and said,</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;9th Prince.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Caitlin was forced to step back. In-gong swallowed his saliva and imitated Silvan&#x2019;s bow.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;9th Prince Shutra Ignus greets the 4th Queen.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">It seemed like the same greeting, but there was a slight difference in accent and behavior.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">After finishing his greeting, In-gong looked at Elaine who was showing a different smile.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Those are good eyes.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Her voice was still gentle, but there seemed to be a beast hiding in it. Indeed, In-gong thought that she truly was different from Caitlin. The aides didn&#x2019;t give personal greetings, so the only one left was Daphne.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;It is great to see 4th Queen. I am Daphne, the daughter of the 5th concubine, Echo.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Her voice was full of tension, but she didn&#x2019;t show it in her bow. Elaine glanced at Daphne with amusement in her eyes, then moved her gaze. The raccoon, standing beside Daphne with a sour expression, caught her eyes.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;Nice to meet you. Is that a pet beside you?&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Elaine asked and the party became tense. Daphne, who had been asked directly, tried to read Amita&#x2019;s mood as she replied,</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;Uh... that...&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;A party member.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">In-gong said on behalf of Daphne. Caitlin stepped forward and added,</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;This raccoon is the great Amita, Mother.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">It was a slight deviation from courtesy. Everyone was already nervous due to the raccoon&#x2019;s expression, but Elaine didn&#x2019;t dismiss her like before. She had heard the name Amita from Chris.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;Nice to meet you, Amita. Will you please forgive my rudeness that stemmed from ignorance?&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Elaine smiled while lowering her posture. Amita stared at Elaine for a while then shook their head with their arms folded.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;I forgive you.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Thank you.&quot;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Whether it was to make Elaine uncomfortable or for some other reason, Amita did not say anymore. Elaine didn&#x2019;t dare say anything else to Amita and introduced Bruce who was next to her.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;This is the great Master Bruce. He is the lycanthrope that boasts the strongest power.&quot;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Master Bruce was a very big, burly man. His head was full of white hair and there were fine lines all over this face, but that was it. His muscles were tight and his body was almost as good as Carack&#x2019;s.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">He dressed almost just like Chris, with animal hides that made him look like a bandit. In-gong could tell instantly where Chris&#x2019; fashion sense had come from.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">In Knight Saga, Master Bruce hadn&#x2019;t been present for the lycanthrope subjugation. It was because he had suddenly died two weeks before it had happened.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Bruce stared silently at In-gong. It was obvious that Chris had talked to Bruce about In-gong. Bruce&#x2019;s eyes reminded In-gong of the sword duke.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">However, now wasn&#x2019;t the time or place for his personal interest.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Elaine turned around and said,</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;I am surprised by the sudden summons, but you don&apos;t have to worry too much. I don&apos;t know the exact reason for the summons, but... it seems to be unrelated to the princes and princesses. Use today to relax.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Her gentleness was nice. Elaine then glanced at Chris who was standing on her right.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;Chris, can I ask you to guide your brothers and sisters?&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;Leave it to me.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Chris replied with a rigid expression. Silvan had a somewhat complicated expression on his face, but Chris didn&#x2019;t pay him any attention.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Elaine ignored the strange tension and called out to In-gong,</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;9th Prince, please take a short walk with me.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Felicia jumped and her eyes sharpened. In-gong just responded like he had already been expecting it.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;I understand.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">The party split in two.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Chris led one group to the palace while Ludwig and the Blood Companions escorted In-gong and Elaine.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Except for Ludwig, the other Blood Companions kept a considerable distance from Elaine. In-gong, Elaine and Ludwig walked ahead at a distance from where they couldn&#x2019;t be heard.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">As soon as they entered the garden, Elaine said quickly,</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;So, have you thought about it?&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Elaine stopped talking with any honorifics.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">In-gong looked slightly surprised by her sudden change in attitude, but Elaine just shrugged.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Like I said, you are my child. Moreover, didn&#x2019;t you make a commitment after learning Divine Beast Authority from Chris and Caitlin? So, I should treat you properly like my child. Do you want a hug?&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Her mischievous smile made her very different from Caitlin. Instead of indirectly hugging an adult Caitlin, In-gong chose to speak.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;I&#x2019;ve thought about it and I&#x2019;ve come to a conclusion.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">In-gong hesitated before cutting to the chase. Elaine laughed as she stepped forward and turned to face In-gong.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Interesting. Can you tell me your conclusion?&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;I will become the demon king.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">His voice was calm. Elaine tilted her head and asked again,</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;Why?&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;I want to keep something.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Wanting to keep something...</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">The &#xA0;motivation wasn&#x2019;t great, but Elaine was very satisfied.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;How interesting. Isn&#x2019;t this purpose the same as mine?&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Elaine didn&#x2019;t ask what he wanted to keep. She just turned around and started walking again. In-gong walked next to her for a while before she opened her mouth again.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;Shutra, the lycanthropes will support you. As Chris already said, if you become the demon king, that will be the best outcome for all of us.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;It that so?&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;It is. Keeping the status quo isn&#x2019;t as easy as it sounds. It is a lie if I say I don&#x2019;t want things to improve.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Elaine laughed playfully, then her expression changed. Her eyes narrowed and she frowned slightly.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;If the 1st Prince, 2nd Prince or 4th Princess becomes the demon king, the lycanthropes are likely to lose our current position. Unlike the current demon king, they have a lot of people on their mothers&#x2019; sides. They aren&#x2019;t few in number like the sura, who are foolish warriors.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">The sura queen didn&#x2019;t participate in politics. Even Gallehed, one of the five captains, stayed at the Demon King&#x2019;s Palace unattended.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">However, the draconians and nightmares were different.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;The dark elves will have similar worries. Win them over well. In particular, the 6th Princess and 3rd Queen... it is more important to gain their hearts than Silvan&#x2019;s. Well, you seem to have already gained 6th Princess&#x2019; heart. I can tell by looking at her eyes.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Elaine laughed as she recalled Felicia and In-gong smiled with embarrassment.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Is it because 5th Prince is a man?&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;You&#x2019;re aware of it. The dark elves are a female centered society. The women plot while the men fight bravely. It isn&#x2019;t 5th Prince but 6th Princess that holds the key. Moreover, 5th Prince is very dedicated to 6th Princess. It is like Chris and Caitlin but reversed.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Just as In-gong thought, Silvan was in charge of protecting Felicia.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Elained turned around and faced In-gong.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;I will treat you like my child, but our relationship is loose. After becoming the demon king, you may do something ungrateful and stab us in the back. So, I&#x2019;m not expecting anything big right now. The honeymoon period has just begun, so it would be nice to build up our relationship gradually.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Elaine said that their connection was weak. In-gong was a gandharva, not a lycanthrope.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Moreover... there are still secrets, so our relationship is far from being developed.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Elaine winked with a giggle and turned back around.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">The talk about their relationship ended with this.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Then In-gong asked something else,</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Is there any more information about this summon?&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;It is like I said before. Something has happened, but it doesn&#x2019;t seem to be about the children of the demon king. Don&#x2019;t worry, the demon king isn&#x2019;t angry with his children.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">At least it wasn&#x2019;t about Caitlin. If it truly was about Caitlin, then Elaine wouldn&#x2019;t be as peaceful as she was now.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">This time, Elaine was the one who asked In-gong,</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;How do you intend to return to the Demon King&#x2019;s Palace?&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;I will return to the Demon King&#x2019;s Palace with everyone else on Silvan&#x2019;s flying ship.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">This meant they weren&#x2019;t going to use the transfer formation. Elaine&apos;s eyes narrowed.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Why?&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;There is already a spotlight on the entry. This way I can give the Demon King&#x2019;s Palace a proper shake up.&quot;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Elaine was able to understand instantly and she laughed once again.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;I really like the way you think. Chris will actively support your idea.&quot;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Elaine stopped walking, made a &#x2018;hu&#x2019; sound as she breathed out and started talking again.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;This much should be enough. It isn&#x2019;t good to hold you for too long. 6th Princess will be worried. Isn&#x2019;t she a very cute child?&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;She is a very affectionate noonim.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">In-gong replied with an embarrassed expression and Elaine nodded. She tapped In-gong&#x2019;s shoulder lightly and said,</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Then we&#x2019;ll talk again later.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;I&#x2019;ll see you next time.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Two Blood Companions approached In-gong naturally and guided him. Elaine watched until In-gong and the Blood Companions had left the garden, then stretched her shoulders.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;How interesting. I selected well.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">She had a very satisfied expression on her face, but Ludwig was different. He had a perplexed expression on his face.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Noonim, what did he mean by shaking the palace?&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;9th Prince is already under scrutiny, so it doesn&#x2019;t make sense that there will be no eyes on him. They are already vigilant.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">The things he had done so far were too great. Even if the demon king had called his name at the court gathering, it would be nothing if he hadn&#x2019;t done anything afterwards.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Then what should be done? Take the time to relax the vigilance of the competitors? Or turn their eyes to others who aren&#x2019;t competitors?&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Noonim, make it easier to understand please.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Elaine clicked her tongue at Ludwig&#x2019;s pathetic request. Despite leading the Blood Companions, Ludwig was overly simplistic, so Elaine explained it to her cousin.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Silvan, that child never leaves his flying ship. If they use the transport formation, then Silvan has to go back alone on his flying ship. This appearance isn&#x2019;t suitable.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Appearance?&quot;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Think about it. Not one or two, but five child of the demon king have gathered and they are returning to the Demon King&#x2019;s Palace like that. Can their loving brothers and sisters look on and laugh?&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Ludwig&#x2019;s eyes widened, then he started counting off with his fingers.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;5, 6, 7, 8, 9... That&#x2019;s more than half the number.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Five out of the nine royal children.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Yes, that&#x2019;s more than half of them. They don&#x2019;t have influence yet, but it is definitely impressive. Additionally, they are a group that had never previously gone together. There is no choice but to look for the link. People will think about who is at the center of the crowd.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Then the answer would quickly emerge.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">They would be able to tell instantly and Chris was going to create that atmosphere.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Isn&#x2019;t this likely to make them more vigilant?&quot;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Ludwig asked in a concerned voice. Elaine shook her head.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;As I mentioned earlier, they are already wary. Moreover, 9th Prince is different from the other princes and princesses... I want them to show it to the Demon King&#x2019;s Palace, that a new faction has appeared in the Demon King&#x2019;s Palace.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">It wasn&#x2019;t just to show off their power to the other children of the demon king. There were others they wanted to show...</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">The nobles of the Demon King&#x2019;s Palace.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">There were also the children of the concubines who hadn&#x2019;t yet chosen a master.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Additionally, there were merchants who were unaffiliated.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;What do you think? It seems to be a bit rushed, but I like it.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">There were now four factions in the Demon King&#x2019;s Palace, not just three. Moreover, the fourth faction wasn&#x2019;t insignificant.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Elaine exhaled. The playfulness disappeared and she said with a mother&#x2019;s face,</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;It might just be a feeling, but I feel I can leave it to that child.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Noonim?&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Elaine didn&#x2019;t say anything more. She shook her head and walked with a wolf-like look.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Let&apos;s go back.&quot;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Elaine didn&#x2019;t look back and headed straight to the main hall.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&amp;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">A day passed.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">After Silvan joined Chris, he became significantly less talkative and it was the same for Chris.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Even when the Black Flame Dragon left the lycanthrope territory, the awkward silence between the two people continued. However, both of them showed their usual appearance when the other was absent.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">In-gong was curious about what happened between the two of them but found it hard to ask.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Then after a few days...</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">While Amita designed blueprints and In-gong and Caitlin practiced with the Moonlight Core and Starlight Core, the Black Flame Dragon continued flying to the Demon King&#x2019;s Palace.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Carack, who was standing next to In-gong and watching the full moon, turned to In-gong and asked,</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;By the way, I feel a little anxious. Something unforeseen always happens with the demon king. I&#x2019;m sure that it will explode this time as well.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Carack had already determined that there would be an incident.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">In-gong poked Carack&#x2019;s side.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;Hey, what basis do you have for saying that?&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Prince is the basis. You are the reason. And Prince, hasn&#x2019;t Prince learnt from your own history?&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Why should I learn?&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;What happened in the past will happen in the future. It is like that for all people. It isn&#x2019;t an exaggeration to say that Prince&#x2019;s history guarantees that things will happen in the future.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Carack laughed and In-gong fell silent. He wanted to refute it but couldn&#x2019;t think of any words.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">In the first court gathering, the demon king had called one of his children&#x2019;s names for the first time.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">In the second court gathering, he had given In-gong a mission... A mission that everyone had thought belonged to Zephyr.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">If so, what would happen this time?</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Patterns can be broken.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;I have my doubts, but won&#x2019;t we know once we arrive?&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Carack responded effortlessly to In-gong&#x2019;s defense and waved abruptly. In-gong glanced over to see Sepira smiling widely. It was an expression he had seen on Daphne, Seira, Delia and Karma&#x2019;s faces.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Why are you looking at me like that?&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;My aide really is an orc.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Of course, I am an orc. Or am I an ogre?&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Carack just laughed while In-gong wondered why he had the pheromone effects of a main character.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Then two days later...</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">The party arrived at the Demon King&#x2019;s Palace.</span></p><hr><p><br></p><p><br></p></div><p><br></p>
