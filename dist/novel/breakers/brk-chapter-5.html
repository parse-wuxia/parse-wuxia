Carack&#x2019;s reaction was natural. His actions were normal if In-gong had actually remembered!</p><p>In-gong sighed and acted rationally instead of bothering Carack about it.</p><p>&#x201C;When is it happening today?&#x201D;</p><p>It was still morning, so it was okay if it was a little &#x2018;late&#x2019;. There was still time if the meeting occurred late in the afternoon or evening.</p><p>Carack scratched his chin again and replied.</p><p>&#x201C;Eh... It was decided to do it before lunch, so the meeting is at 11 o&#x2019;clock.&#x201D;</p><p>Rather than thinking about the unit of time in Knight Saga, he zoomed in on the mini-map that had a clock function next to it. It was 9:52 a.m.</p><p>&apos;It is one hour away!&#x2019;</p><p>Dammit! Why was he only told just before the meeting?</p><p>&#x201C;Where?&#x201D;</p><p>In-gong asked reflexively and Carack pointed beyond the mountains.</p><p>&#x201C;We decided to do it at Princess Caitlin&#x2019;s location. It is time to go so you should be prepared.&#x201D;</p><p>It was already like this, so it was impossible to prepare properly.</p><p>In-gong calmed his heart and started thinking rationally. What he needed now wasn&#x2019;t swearing or lamentation.</p><p>Information. He had to have information.</p><p>&quot;Hey, Carack. Do you remember that I&#x2019;m a little confused because of the fever?&#x201D;</p><p>&quot;Is Prince really okay?&#x201D;</p><p>Carack looked worried again. Despite being a bit clumsy, he didn&#x2019;t seem like a bad guy.</p><p>&#x201C;I&#x2019;m okay. Anyway, can you tell me about Chris and Caitlin? For example, what I call them.&#x201D;</p><p>The honorifics.</p><p>When just looking at age, it was natural to call Caitlin by noona and Chris by hyung (Noona= what males use for older females. Hyung= what males use for men older than them). But Shutra, Caitlin and Chris were all part of the royal family.</p><p>&#x2018;I don&#x2019;t think I would call them by Hyung or Noona.&#x2019;</p><p>Carack stared at In-gong before saying in a decisive voice.</p><p>&quot;I don&#x2019;t know.&#x201D;</p><p>&quot;You should have seen it at the meeting!&#x201D;</p><p>&quot;Today is the first meeting. I told you, I only met Prince yesterday.&#x201D;</p><p>It was perfect logic. In the end, In-gong lost to the orc&#x2019;s logic and sprang up.</p><p>&quot;Okay, let&#x2019;s prepare to depart.&#x201D;</p><p>&amp;</p><p>In fact, nothing special was needed to be prepared for the departure. He just needed to wear different clothes.</p><p>&apos;This is due to the fever.&#x2019;</p><p>They might think it was strange but he would continue to push the idea.</p><p>&#x2018;I just need to seem okay.&#x2019;</p><p>Of course, there would be some doubts but what could they do? He had Shutra&#x2019;s body!</p><p>Carack hadn&#x2019;t moved past In-gong&#x2019;s actions simply because he was an orc.</p><p>&apos;Yes, maybe they will just be worried like Carack.&#x2019;</p><p>The crucial part was that Shutra, Chris and Caitlin weren&#x2019;t close friends. They might be worried but not suspicious.</p><p>&apos;Or they might not be worried at all.&#x2019;</p><p>In-gong nodded and looked around for a while. Carack was at the front with orcs walking on either side of him.</p><p>&apos;Let me think. I will try to reason it out.&#x2019;</p><p>He had cleared Knight Saga from Zephyr&#x2019;s point of view. Therefore, he didn&#x2019;t know the nuances of the relationship between Shutra, Chris and Caitlin.</p><p>However, it was possible to reason things out to a certain degree.</p><p>Zephyr had little contact with Shutra, Chris and Caitlin as a child. The reasons were different but in Shutra&#x2019;s case, he had always stayed in a corner while Chris and Caitlin barely spent any time at the palace.</p><p>Unlike the other queens, Elaine Moonlight, queen of the lycanthropes and mother of Chris and Caitlin, didn&#x2019;t have any ambitions to make her children the Demon King. Chris and Caitlin were educated at the royal palace of the lycanthropes.</p><p>Therefore, the two of them spend most of their childhood in the land of the lycanthropes rather than the Demon King&#x2019;s Palace.</p><p>&#x2018;In other words, Shutra should have had almost no contact with Chris and Caitlin.&#x2019;</p><p>This was probably not the first meeting but there was a high possibility that they hadn&#x2019;t had a conversation before.</p><p>&apos;Okay, I will just push forward. I won&#x2019;t care about acting different.&#x2019;</p><p>He had a severe fever and couldn&#x2019;t remember anything. He seemed to have acquired a partial memory loss.</p><p>In-gong nodded with a determined expression but he soon found it tough to breathe.</p><p>&apos;Pant pant, my body has levelled up but my stamina is still low.&#x2019;</p><p>He was currently level 3. He had nine points in each state but he was still weaker than Villager A. It was hard to climb up the rough mountain trail.</p><p>&quot;Almost there. Just have a little more strength.&#x201D;</p><p>Carack said with a smile. It seemed that In-gong looked exhausted.</p><p>&#x201C;Yes.&#x201D;</p><p>In-gong laughed and stepped forward with difficulty. How far did they walk? The uphill slope gradually calmed to reveal a wide vacant lot.</p><p>&quot;We are here.&#x201D;</p><p>In-gong stretched and looked around at Carack&#x2019;s words. The vacant lot wasn&#x2019;t empty. It was an army base. It couldn&#x2019;t be compared to In-gong&#x2019;s base and seemed more like a village.</p><p>There were dozens of tents lined up in an orderly manner with cheap and permanent grazing grounds.</p><p>The soldiers were also different. Dozens of soldiers with the symbol of the lycanthropes seemed to be Caitlin&#x2019;s troops. Everyone was wearing black leather armour and they all looked big and wild.</p><p>They were obviously elite soldiers.</p><p>The orcs among the elite soldiers also looked different. The orcs were obviously local soldiers and didn&#x2019;t seem much different from In-gong&#x2019;s but they looked stronger and more resilient.</p><p>Carack laughed as he saw the tension on In-gong&#x2019;s face.</p><p>&quot;It&#x2019;s okay, they are on our side. Isn&#x2019;t it reassuring?&#x201D;</p><p>It seemed like he thought In-gong was frightened by the atmosphere.</p><p>&quot;Yes, they are on our side.&#x201D;</p><p>In-gong replied lightly but he spoke in a low voice.</p><p>Carack knocked his shoulders against In-gong&#x2019;s.</p><p>&quot;Let&apos;s go inside. That is the meeting place.&#x201D;</p><p>Located in the heart of the base was a large tent surrounded by lycanthrope warriors.</p><p>&#x2018;Chris and Caitlin.&#x2019;</p><p>The 7th prince and 8th princess.</p><p>Shutra&#x2019;s half siblings.</p><p>They were like two wild beasts in front of Zephyr; the lycanthrope monsters.</p><p>In-gong swallowed his saliva and entered the tent with Carack.</p><p>&amp;</p><p>In-gong was startled by the insides of the tent. The inside and outside of the tent were completely different.</p><p>It wasn&#x2019;t an exaggeration to say that the inside of the tent was like a luxurious palace. The floor had fluffy carpets and the walls were decorated with beautiful silks. Despite being inside a tent, it was completely bright.</p><p>A gentle light poured from the ceiling and it was reminiscent of stained glass in a cathedral.</p><p>There was a circular table located in the middle of the tent. In-gong was an outsider to this world but it still seemed luxurious.</p><p>A large map of a battlefield with elaborate models was laid out on the table.</p><p>&#x201C;Please sit here.&#x201D;</p><p>A young man wearing the emblem of the lycanthropes guided In-gong toward a seat. It seemed like there were only three seats for In-gong, Chris and Caitlin.</p><p>Once In-gong was seated, the young man said with a smile.</p><p>&quot;Prince Chris and Princess Caitlin will be coming soon. Please wait a moment.&#x201D;</p><p>He had nothing to do but wait. In-gong watched the clock attached to the mini-map. There were 10 minutes left until the scheduled meeting time.</p><p>&#x2018;This is great.&#x2019;</p><p>As expected from Chris and Caitlin.</p><p>Shutra was the child of the Demon King but he was different in many ways.</p><p>In fact, In-gong didn&#x2019;t have good impressions of Chris and Caitlin. It was because they worked hard to block him whenever he played Zephyr.</p><p>It had been a nightmare fighting Chris and Caitlin. He&#x2019;d been able to save and load the game but he had died many times. That&#x2019;s not even mentioning their soldiers.</p><p>As the fight over the succession to the throne deepened, the fighting became more bloody. Sometimes, he barely managed to face them during an event.</p><p>Chris had growled at his enemies while Caitlin had watched silently with a frozen face.</p><p>&#x2018;I could call them middle-ranked bosses.&#x2019;</p><p>He now had to meet those two people. If possible, he needed to maintain a friendly relationship with them. In-gong needed allies to face Zephyr.</p><p>&apos;I need to oppose Zephyr while stopping others from joining him.&#x2019;</p><p>He sighed as he thought about it. It was like Yan Baihu standing up to his enemies in an isolated area.</p><p>&#x201C;Prince.&#x201D;</p><p>Carack&#x2019;s low voice snapped him out of it. He jumped with surprise and heard voices outside the tent.</p><p>Chris and Caitlin, the two of them had appeared.</p><hr><p>[TL] Occasionally the author will write a note with some facts about the novel. I will translate some of them.&#xA0;</p><p>Here is the first one:</p><p>I will explain it again but let&#x2019;s talk about something in advance...</p><p>The children of the Demon King take their mother&#x2019;s surnames. They will only take the name of their father if they are confirmed as the next king or official heir to the king.</p><p><br></p></div><p><br></p>
