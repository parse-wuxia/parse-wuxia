<p><span>Chapter 115 - Chapter 18: Auction #7</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p><p><span>In Knight Saga, it had been Year 515 when he fought the barbarians beyond the limit line.</span></p><p><span>At that time, Caitlin had been much weaker than she was during the lycanthrope subjugation in Year 516, but that was because she had still been a teenage girl.</span></p><p><span>The already mature Paratus would have a similar strength to Mad Dog Jiks.&#xA0;</span><span>Paratus&#x2019; strength was at least that of an intermediate general. However, he was much fiercer than Mad Dog Jiks, and he was also aiming for In-gong&#x2019;s life.</span></p><p><span>&#x2018;The unique characteristic of barbarians is their Body Hardening technique!&#x2019;</span></p><p><span>As the name suggested, it was a technique that strengthened the body.&#xA0;</span><span>However, it wasn&#x2019;t a skill that could be acquired. Just as dragon technique required dragon characteristics, the barbarian&#x2019;s Body Hardening required a body that inherited the blood of a barbarian.</span></p><p><span>After triggering Body Hardening, Paratus&#x2019; upper body swelled. The suit he was wearing tore apart in an instant, revealing a grey shell, that was like a crustacean&#x2019;s, which covered the skin.&#xA0;</span><span>It went beyond strengthening the body and appeared more like he was forming an armour around it.</span></p><p><span>Paratus normally carried a large weapon in Knight Saga, but he was now bare-handed. However, In-gong wasn&#x2019;t fully alert, and Paratus didn&#x2019;t miss this moment.</span></p><p><i><span>Kwang!</span></i></p><p><span>A huge crack formed on the ground where Paratus had been, but In-gong didn&#x2019;t confront Paratus, who was like a runaway train. He avoided the blow quickly using Wind Style.</span></p><p><i><span>Kwa kwang!</span></i></p><p><span>Paratus&#x2019;s fist struck the place where In-gong was standing. The floor that was hit by the hardened fist cracked and dozens of stones flew up.</span></p><p><span>In-gong looked at the floor and Paratus at the same time. As In-gong used Wind Style again, he transferred aura into Earth Quaker.</span></p><p><span>Paratus turned toward In-gong. As White Eagle and Black Eagle rushed toward Paratus, In-gong poured aura, magic power and divine power into Earth Quaker.</span></p><p><span>It was a different feeling from when he fought Mad Dog Jiks.</span></p><p><span>There was no sense of incompatibility with Earth Quaker. It was as if Earth Quaker had been made for In-gong from the beginning.&#xA0;</span><span>The flow of aura had also changed. Earth Quaker accepted In-gong&#x2019;s aura naturally. Not only was the aura absorbed faster than before, the absorption efficiency was even better now.</span></p><p><span>Amita had strengthened White Eagle externally; Black Eagle had been added, and there were new accessories.</span></p><p><span>Earth Quaker had been tuned, and the Great Enkidu&#x2019;s equipment was now reborn as In-gong&#x2019;s.</span></p><p><span>While In-gong focused all his consciousness on it, Paratus read White Eagle&#x2019;s and Black Eagle&#x2019;s movements and rushed toward one side. In-gong continued to inject aura into Earth Quaker.</span></p><p><span>It took a few seconds for Paratus to catch up with In-gong, who retreated again and activated Night Watch&#x2019;s Blink.</span></p><p><span>Blink was different from the magic installed in the transportation formations. It only moved a short distance, and there had to be no obstacles between the caster and the target destination.&#xA0;</span><span>Night Watch&#x2019;s Blink could be used three times a day.</span></p><p><span>A dark blue fog appeared as the second Blink was triggered, and Paratus&#x2019; punch went through the air. In-gong landed on the ground 10 meters away, but Paratus didn&#x2019;t stop and searched around for In-gong like a wild beast.</span></p><p><span>However, 10 meters was not a short distance, and Paratus narrowed the distance between him and In-gong in an instant.</span></p><p><span>Instead of blinking or stepping back, In-gong ran toward the spot where Paratus had first hit the ground.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;You!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Paratus cried out angrily. As In-gong kept on running away, Paratus was incensed.</span></p><p><span>However, In-gong just ignored it. Rather, he was hoping that Paratus would lose his temper. During the few seconds of time Blink had created, he inserted more aura into Earth Quaker.</span></p><p><span>Paratus had an ominous and urgent feeling. In-gong was focusing power on his right hand, and it seemed like a big thing that might explode at any moment.</span></p><p><span>Paratus roared loudly. The powerful energy from the roar was a weapon in itself. It would cause the body to freeze momentarily.</span></p><p><span>However, In-gong just ignored Paratus&#x2019;s roar. In-gong had endured the gaze of the demon king. So, he didn&#x2019;t even need to use the power of the Tears of a Dark Elf as he ignored Paratus&#x2019; roar and prepared the technique.</span></p><p><span>Paratus, who rushed toward In-gong as soon as he roared, hesitated. Indeed, he had the gut instinct of a beast. Instead of rushing toward Paratus, In-gong raised his fist high.</span></p><p><span>He couldn&#x2019;t allow Paratus to get the golden helmet, but that didn&#x2019;t mean he had to deal with Paratus here.&#xA0;</span><span>Right now, Paratus didn&#x2019;t have the golden helmet. It was In-gong who had it!</span></p><p><span>&#x2018;True Destruction!&#x2019;</span></p><p><span>This was Earth Quaker&apos;s super special move. A white aura spread as In-gong&#x2019;s knuckles hit the ground. Like collapsed dominoes, hundreds of cracks covered the ground instantly.</span></p><p><span>Paratus&#x2019; mouth dropped open, but In-gong hadn&#x2019;t used True Destruction on Paratus.</span></p><p><i><span>Kwaaaaaang!</span></i></p><p><span>In-gong had seen the aftermath of True Destruction in Spider Forest, where the terrain had been destroyed. He had hit the ground directly, so it couldn&#x2019;t endure the pressure despite In-gong controlling the power. The thick stone floor, that was a few meters in diameter, broke into dozens of pieces, and Paratus fell along with the floor.</span></p><p><span>Takar&#x2019;s auction house was located in a sunny spot, not the shade. Furthermore, under the auction house, there was a wall with a high ceiling of approximately 20 meters.</span></p><p><span>In-gong, who had grasped the floor plan of the auction house from the mini-map, had no intention of having a full frontal battle with Paratus from the very beginning. The most important thing had been to secure Nayatra and the golden helmet, not fight the boss on the premises.</span></p><p><span>Thanks to Night Watch&#x2019;s ability to fly, In-gong flew up and stepped on White Eagle. He could hear Green Wind crying that she didn&#x2019;t want to lose to Night Watch.</span></p><p><span>In-gong looked down below. The damage was so enormous that it seemed like the building itself was going to collapse. Additionally, he couldn&#x2019;t see Paratus because he was buried in heavy debris.</span></p><p><span>In-gong was satisfied with this much.</span></p><p><span>It was unlikely that Paratus would die from this, but he would take a long time to climb back up. At that point, he might be blocked by subordinates of Takar&#x2019;s ruler, Vulcanus, and be unable to return at all.</span></p><p><span>In-gong stopped thinking about Paratus and flew in the direction that Carack had headed toward. It wasn&#x2019;t long before he found Carack&#x2019;s hiding place through the mini-map.</span></p><p><span>&#x2018;Prince!&#x2019;</span></p><p><span>Carack mouthed while hiding against a wall. He was hugging Nayatra tightly with one hand, while his other hand covered her mouth.</span></p><p><span>&#x2018;A complete kidnapper.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span>He felt sorry for Carack, but there was no other interpretation of the scene. In-gong jumped from White Eagle and approached Carack.</span></p><p><span>&quot;There was the sound of fighting over there, so I had to hide.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>In-gong nodded. Carack was currently unarmed, and he was carrying Nayatra. He would be unable to counterattack properly, so going out would just lead to death.</span></p><p><span>&quot;What about that big guy? I heard a huge sound.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;I made it so he can&#x2019;t chase us.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>In-gong responded and looked at Nayatra. He could only see half her face since it was covered by Carack&#x2019;s large hand, but she was accepting the situation quite calmly.</span></p><p><span>It was indeed Nayatra, who had been called the &#x2018;Ice Knight&#x2019; among Zephyr&#x2019;s subordinates. Instead of struggling to escape from Carack, Nayatra stared straight into In-gong&#x2019;s eyes.</span></p><p><span>Fear and wonder could be seen in that calmness. In-gong narrowed the distance with Nayatra, and instead of giving her the same greeting as when he had first encountered Vandal, In-gong delivered a name to her through magic.</span></p><p><span>&apos;Rafiseria.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span>At that moment, Nayatra&#x2019;s eyes widened. She tried to speak despite her mouth being blocked,</span></p><p><span>&#x2018;How&#x2014; How do you know that name!&#x2019;</span></p><p><span>Nightmares were a species known for indulgence, but there was a contradiction. Although they joined their bodies easily with others, they had one true love.</span></p><p><span>There was only one in their life, and once found, they would never betray their love. Even their parents weren&#x2019;t allowed to know their true name. This name was something that only their true love would know.</span></p><p><span>&#x2018;The path that Zephyr used to learn it was a bit different though.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span>A nightmare slave was forced to tell their master their true name. Since the name itself contained magic, the nightmare couldn&#x2019;t go against their master.</span></p><p><span>&#x2018;Rafiseria.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span>Nayatra fell into confusion after hearing her true name. The calmness, that hadn&#x2019;t been lost due to the kidnapping, collapsed completely.</span></p><p><span>In-gong glanced at Carack, who then let Nayatra go. In-gong grabbed Nayatra&#x2019;s hand and said,</span></p><p><span>&quot;I&apos;ll explain everything later. Just follow me once. I don&#x2019;t mean to do anything to you.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Nayatra&#x2019;s eyes shook, and she bit her lip before nodding.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;I understand. It is an emergency, so I will listen to the story later.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Yes, thank you.&quot;</span></p><p><span>In-gong sighed with relief, not that it was unlikely that she would vanish.</span></p><p><span>&#x2018;There is a high chance that I have the things Nayatra is looking for.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span>In fact, he had one more reason to smash the floor and destroy the place where the auction items were stored.&#xA0;</span><span>He had placed the auction items in his inventory.</span></p><p><span>In Knight Saga, Vulcanus was like a villainous merchant, so In-gong&#x2019;s conscience wasn&#x2019;t affected.</span></p><p><span>Moreover, if he left the items there, they would have been lost or destroyed by Paratus.</span></p><p><span>&#x2018;It is a good thing. Uhh, yes. That&#x2019;s right.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span>In-gong coughed and opened his inventory hurriedly. He didn&#x2019;t know what items he had gotten aside from the Dragon King&#x2019;s Golden Helmet, but now wasn&#x2019;t the time to look through them one by one.</span></p><p><span>In-gong took out a dwarf axe and shield and threw them to Carack.</span></p><p><span>Then In-gong looked back at Nayatra. She was amazed by In-gong, who had pulled the axe and shield out of the air. However, Nayatra held a dagger in her hands&#x2014;she was a skilled thief and assassin.</span></p><p><span>&quot;Nayatra, follow me. And Carack, I will lead the way. Protect my back.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Understood. Be careful, Prince.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Carack smiled and stepped back. Nayatra&#x2019;s eyes widened again.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;P-prince?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>The shock in her eyes wasn&#x2019;t like when females met the idol singers they worshipped but a pleasant surprise in the eyes that were as calm as a lake.</span></p><p><span>&#x2018;That reminds me, didn&#x2019;t Nayatra like fairy tales?&#x2019;</span></p><p><span>Moreover, it seemed like her personality was more active than it had been before she became a slave in Knight Saga.</span></p><p><span>&quot;I will also explain that later.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>In-gong said with a smile before starting to run.</span></p><p><span>&amp;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Shutra!&#x201D;</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p>
