<p><span>Chapter 201 - Chapter 42: Awareness #3</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p><p><span>It was Chris who broke the deadlock even though he was sitting still. He watched the tension with a delighted expression before laughing and pulling Caitlin up.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&quot;I&#x2019;d like to finish it today, but I&#x2019;ll let it go for now.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>Chris&#x2019; words caused everyone to stir uneasily. The one with the greatest reaction was Felicia.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&quot;F-Finish! Chris! What the hell are you imagining?&#x201D;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>Felicia shouted with a red face. Shame was clearly present in Felicia&#x2019;s voice, causing Chris to widen his eyes and speak with a coy expression,&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&quot;What is Noonim imagining? Huh?&#x201D;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>In-gong also wondered this. What did she imagine from Chris&#x2019; words? </span><span>In-gong&#x2019;s face turned redder at the thought, and it was the same with Felicia. It wasn&#x2019;t an exaggeration to say that her whole body was red.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Ah, no&#x2026; I mean...&#x201D;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>She stammered in a tearful voice, but she couldn&#x2019;t think of a proper excuse. Chris grinned, while Caitlin asked with confusion,</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Unni?&#x201D;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>Her eyes were innocent and clear. Seeing Caitlin&#x2019;s expression, Felicia groaned with dismay like it was hard to face that pureness.&#xA0;</span><span>Once again, it was Silvan who saved Felicia.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Sob, sob. Felicia, this is the heart of a father who is giving his daughter away in marriage.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Ah, come on!&#x201D;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>Felicia reacted like usual, but her eyes were filled with gratitude toward Silvan.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Hmm, hmm. Then shall we end it here? Delia, Seira, and Sepira will be worried.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>Carack, who had been watching the situation calmly, spoke and wrapped up the situation. Silvan, who had been struggling to overcome this situation, immediately agreed with Carack.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Yes, let&#x2019;s get up first. It isn&#x2019;t just today. Let&#x2019;s talk about this slowly in the future.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>Time was needed for everyone to cool down and think. Chris seemed to agree, but then he laughed and said roguishly,</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Think about it Shutra. Caitlin will be an even more beautiful woman in the future.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;O-Oppa.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>Caitlin felt his share of shame. As In-gong watched Caitlin try to hide behind Chris&#x2019; big body, he nodded inadvertently. Caitlin, who was just ahead of her 16th birthday, was still a teenage girl. As Chris said, she would become even more amazing in the future.&#xA0;</span><span>Once Chris spoke like this, Silvan felt some rivalry as he gazed toward Felicia.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Shutra, our Felicia is already an amazing beauty, but she will become more so in the future. Felicia is always the best.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>Unlike Caitlin who had risen from her seat, Felicia was still sitting next to In-gong. When he thought about it, they were still holding hands.&#xA0;</span><span>Felicia flinched and turned her head away again. Thanks to that, she exposed her red neck and ears.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Prince, the situation is reoccurring.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>Carack once again organized the situation. Silvan was immediately aware that he had embarrassed Felicia further and backpedalled.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Well, yes. I should stop now. Good night, Shutra.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>Silvan then reached out and pulled Felicia up. She staggered instantly, like she had lost strength in her legs, but soon stood upright and opened her fan.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Yes, good night. Shutra.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>Felicia stuttered like she couldn&#x2019;t shake off her agitation even with the fan, making her cuter in In-gong&#x2019;s eyes.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&#x2018;It is too much.&#x2019;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>Everything she did looked cute.&#xA0;</span><span>As In-gong was thinking this, Caitlin also opened her mouth. Her cheeks were still red, but she showed a more relaxed smile than Felicia.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Have a good night&apos;s sleep. Have good dreams.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Yes, dream of Caitlin.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Yes.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>Chris interjected, and In-gong replied automatically, making the mood odd again.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>Silvan seemed to want to tell In-gong to dream of Felicia, while Caitlin punched Chris with resentment and Felicia buried her face in her fan. </span><span>Carack couldn&#x2019;t stand this endless loop anymore, so he said to the princes and princesses,&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Come on, go to sleep. It&#x2019;s late in the night.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>He waved his hand and chased them away.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Huoong...&#x201D;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>After everyone left and only Carack remained, In-gong let out a long breath. It was a sigh filled with many emotions.&#xA0;</span><span>Carack gazed at him and said,&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Prince, it was hard to look at. I felt embarrassed for you.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Hey, why should I be embarrassed?&#x201D;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Isn&#x2019;t your mouth smiling too much? That is why. You will understand if you look in a mirror.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>Carack was as sharp as always, and In-gong flinched for a moment before smiling coolly.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Well... it is great.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>They were Felicia and Caitlin, not anybody else. The two people liked In-gong despite their embarrassment, so why shouldn&#x2019;t he feel good?&#xA0;</span><span>Carack shook his head at In-gong&#x2019;s shameless words.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&quot;I was aware of this after meeting you, but you really were far from your brothers and sisters.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>If their period of growing up together had been long, then things might have been different today. In-gong nodded in agreement.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Well... there was nothing in the first place.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>It wasn&#x2019;t an exaggeration. Before becoming one with In-gong, Shutra had virtually no relationship with his other siblings.&#xA0;</span><span>The Red Lightning Tribe mission was the first time he had seen Caitlin, let alone talked to her.&#xA0;</span><span>It was no different with Felicia.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&#x2018;And...&#x2019;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>Felicia and Caitlin weren&#x2019;t In-gong&#x2019;s sisters in the first place.&#xA0;</span><span>However, he couldn&#x2019;t say this, even if the other person was Carack. It was a story that he hadn&#x2019;t even shared with Felicia, who he had shared almost all his other secrets.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Anyway... thank you. I didn&#x2019;t think that Prince would tell me this secret.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>Carack said, turning his head sideways. It was embarrassing for Carack to say something like this.&#xA0;</span><span>In fact, Carack&#x2019;s reaction was natural. Other than Carack, the other aides hadn&#x2019;t been invited and then a very shocking fact had been revealed.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Of course, I should tell you. You are Carack.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>In-gong laughed, and Carack scratched his head awkwardly. Tonight seemed to be a night of embarrassment.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Then I&#x2019;m asking as Carack... Prince, who truly is the better one?&#x201D;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>Carack asked, turning the warm atmosphere awkward. In-gong cleared his mind and then took a deep breath.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&quot;I think I should become the demon king first. Otherwise, what is the point of discussing it?&#x201D;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Such a big goal?&#x201D;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Of course.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>This world was very different from Knight Saga in many ways, but In-gong still had the Day of Massacre in his head.&#xA0;</span><span>He wouldn&#x2019;t allow himself to be truly happy until he was the demon king.&#xA0;</span><span>Elaine&#x2019;s and Chris&#x2019; plans for marriage would&#x2019;ve been established on the premise that In-gong would become the demon king.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Understood. Then, I will really go now. Will you use the dream pillow so that you don&#x2019;t lose your strength?&#x201D;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Ah, no. I won&#x2019;t use the pillow today.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>In-gong was already in a situation where his delusions were running wild. He was afraid of what he would dream the moment he used the pillow.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Then Master, go for a walk. Master is disgusting right now.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>Green Wind suddenly appeared behind In-gong and hugged his neck. Carack nodded as well.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&quot;It is a good idea. The cold wind is the best to restore your spirit at night.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>In other words, it would calm him down.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Okay, then I will be going for a while.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>He had just been in a heated situation, so the cool wind at night sounded quite nice.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Go safely.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>Carack opened the door of the cabin with a chuckle.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&amp; &#xA0;</span></p><p><span>There were some dark elves on the deck, but fortunately, Felicia and Caitlin weren&#x2019;t present. In-gong greeted the dark elves before heading to a place that was deserted. The cool night breeze cleared his head.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>In-gong became emotional and raised his head toward the night sky. It felt like the stars in the sky were falling toward him.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Prince.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Sword Duke.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>The sword duke approached from behind. He grabbed a seat next to In-gong and stretched.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&quot;That look... you seem refreshed.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Yes.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>The sword duke had been worrying about his reaction. Once In-gong answered calmly, the sword duke sighed and smiled.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&quot;I am relieved. Yes, what about the reaction of the others... Prince? What is with that expression?&#x201D;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>The sword duke frowned and tilted his head. He had expected a reaction, but he didn&#x2019;t think In-gong would look so embarrassed.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Uh, um. That...&#x201D;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>In-gong hesitated before telling the sword duke the story. He didn&#x2019;t tell every detail, but the flow was straightforward, making the sword duke curious.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&quot;What can I say... I imagined this development to happen further in the future.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&quot;I-Is that so?&#x201D;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>The shock of In-gong&#x2019;s birth secret being revealed had changed to confusion and embarrassment.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;The 4th Queen&#x2019;s mindset... I thought it would come eventually... But uh, well, this is quick... Moreover...&#x201D;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Moreover?&#x201D;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&quot;It is strange to say something like this, but shouldn&#x2019;t you normally feel distress over your identity or something like that?&#x201D;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>The sword duke asked.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Uh...&#x201D;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>It was like he said. As far as Shutra&#x2019;s birth was concerned, Shutra wasn&#x2019;t a child born out of a natural process but an artificially created one.&#xA0;</span><span>Usually in this situation, the novel or manhwa protagonist would feel a serious confusion over their identity.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&apos;I am not XX,&#x2019; or &#x2018;I&#x2019;m not human,&#x2019; or &#x2018;I don&#x2019;t care, I am human!&#x2019;... They would think things like that.&#xA0;</span><span>Then they would usually accept their identity through some dramatic situation.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>However, In-gong was different. He didn&#x2019;t feel any confusion over his identity.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&#x2018;Well, Shutra...&#x2019;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>In-gong was already Shutra, but something still felt separate.&#xA0;</span><span>If he had many memories of the 5th Queen, then it might be different. However, it had only been a year since In-gong became Shutra. </span><span>Additionally, the problem of Felicia and Caitlin was far more important than some confusion over his identity.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>After seeing that In-gong didn&#x2019;t feel any identity crisis, the sword duke laughed once again.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Well, you don&#x2019;t have to react like that. It is good. Prince actually seems more dependable. You are mentally tough.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Thank you.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>In-gong replied coolly. The sword duke didn&#x2019;t continue talking about In-gong&#x2019;s identity but switched the topic instead.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Prince, do you remember the first time we met?&#x201D;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&quot;I remember.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>It was when In-gong had been facing the man with the blue aura at Thunderdoom Fortress.&#xA0;</span><span>In-gong had been incapable of beating the enemy before him ,and everyone was prepared for death. That memory was still vivid.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>The sword duke laughed and stared straight at In-gong. In-gong had been impressed by the sword duke, and now the sword duke was impressed by In-gong.&#xA0;</span><span>It wasn&#x2019;t because In-gong was a being created using the essence of the gandharva god. There was something more special about In-gong.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&quot;It isn&#x2019;t because of the divinity of the gandharva. I am really looking forward to Prince&#x2019;s future. Someday, I might bow to you after you are the demon king.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>This was why the demon king had given In-gong the Seed of Extreme Nothingness.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&quot;The group led by Prince is important. Look after the other princes and princesses.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Yes, Sword Duke.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>There were no more questions and answers.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>The sword duke patted In-gong&#x2019;s shoulder and left, while In-gong stayed on the deck for a bit longer.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&amp; &#xA0;</span></p><p><span>Two days later, the Black Flame Dragon arrived at Enger Plains. Anastasia had already arrived first, so she greeted the party.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>As elegant as always, she frowned when she saw the party before her.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;What is with this subtly sweet, happy, and dangerous atmosphere?&#x201D;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>The feeling around Shutra was quite different from when she last saw them.&#xA0;</span><span>Chris was smiling more wickedly than usual, while Silvan was unsure about what to do.&#xA0;</span><span>Felicia and Caitlin on In-gong&#x2019;s left and right looked unnatural, as Caitlin kept on fidgeting and Felicia never removed the fan from her face.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>In the centre of all that, In-gong was just smiling.&#xA0;</span><span>Anastasia felt quite favourable toward In-gong, but she couldn&#x2019;t help wanting to beat that expression off his face.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&quot;T-That... it is nothing. Yes, there is nothing.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>Felicia said quickly. Anastasia looked dubious as her eyes narrowed even further.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Hrmm...?&#x201D;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>Her questioning gaze was scary, but no one opened their mouths.&#xA0;</span><span>In-gong was familiar with Anastasia, but there was a clear difference in position between Anastasia&#x2019;s faction and Shutra&#x2019;s faction.&#xA0;</span><span>Anastasia was still a powerful adversary and head of a rival faction, so she couldn&#x2019;t be told his birth secret.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&quot;What&#x2014;what are you doing?&#x201D;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>Anastasia attacked Felicia, who was the closest and seemed the easiest. The normal Felicia would&#x2019;ve replied in a certain way, but she didn&#x2019;t answer.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&quot;How suspicious.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>Anastasia&#x2019;s eyes narrowed even more. Felicia, who was in charge of Anastasia, was in a helpless state, so there was no one to deal with her.&#xA0;</span><span>Chris was able to compete with Anastasia, but he just laughed like the situation was funny. Then just as In-gong was about to open his mouth...&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&quot;4th Princess, shouldn&#x2019;t you move? It seems like there are more people who want to say hello.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>The sword duke moved like the wind and spoke to Anastasia. She was surprised by the sword duke&#x2019;s appearance but regained her poise as always.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&quot;4th Princess Anastasia Nekrion greets the sword duke.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;A pleasure. You are still as beautiful as ever.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>Anastasia was one of several people who had gathered at the Enger Plains to greet them, and she displayed a formal greeting to the sword duke.&#xA0;</span><span>Felicia sighed with relief when Anastasia&#x2019;s attention was turned away from her and toward the sword duke instead.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Come this way. We have prepared a small welcoming ceremony. It would be better to exchange greetings there.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>Anastasia said gracefully as she led the way. At that moment, In-gong saw the people behind Anastasia. There was some good faces.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&apos;Ferocious Eyes.&#x2019;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>As the name suggests, the eyes were ferocious. However, despite the scary eyes, In-gong just smiled at him.&#xA0;</span><span>It wasn&#x2019;t just Ferocious Eyes who In-gong greeted gladly. Among the crowd at Enger Plains, many of them were In-gong&#x2019;s people.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>Vandal&#x2019;s large size made him stand out as he smiled at In-gong, and there was a beautiful woman smiling beside Vandal.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>The succubus, Nayatra...&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>It was her.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&amp; &#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Your Highness, I will report about the information I&#x2019;ve collected.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Yes.&#x201D;</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p>
