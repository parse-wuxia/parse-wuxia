<p><strong>Chapter 113 Chapter 18: Auction #5.</strong></p><div id="chapterContent" class="innerContent fr-view"><p></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Chapter 113 - Chapter 18: Auction #5</span></p><hr><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">It was an unexpected situation.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Nayatra wasn&#x2019;t a slave.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">In fact, this was more natural. If he looked at the entire Demon World, the number of slaves traded was actually quite small. Apart from places like Takar, it was difficult to find a proper slave market.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Of all the places that In-gong had been to, there hadn&#x2019;t been a place exclusively for slave trading.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">So, why had Nayatra become a slave?</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">What type of experience changed her from a free person into a slave in just one year?</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">However, now wasn&#x2019;t the time to deduce this. While In-gong was thinking, Nayatra had finished her conversation with the slave dealer. She turned and walked away.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;Nayatra!&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">In-gong shouted reflexively, but Nayatra didn&#x2019;t look around and just walked away like it didn&#x2019;t involve her.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Instead of asking if he was mistaken, Carack started running toward Nayatra, and In-gong hurried to follow. There were so many people on the narrow road, but he still moved quite quickly.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Nayatra turned the corner. In-gong felt an ominous feeling the moment she disappeared from sight. In movies and novels, the person always disappeared after turning the corner.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">It was the same in this case as well.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">He turned the corner hurriedly but couldn&#x2019;t see Nayatra. Among the people present, there was no pink hair or even red hair.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">In-gong looked around, while Carack peered over the top of the heads but couldn&#x2019;t see her either. Nayatra must have used stealth or something similar to disappear.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;She looks like the one you called Nayatra, but she ran away. There wasn&#x2019;t even a reaction.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Carack said while scratching his forehead.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">She hadn&#x2019;t even blinked at her name being called and just continued on her way. Additionally, she had showed no signs of hurry.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Normally, people couldn&#x2019;t react like this unless they were prepared for the situation. There would usually be a small flinch or reaction.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Carack&#x2019;s common sense told him there were only two occupations with such behaviours: one was a thief and the other was assassin.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Prince, is the relationship between the two of you bad?&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Carack asked In-gong with an expression of concern.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;It isn&#x2019;t like that. Nayatra doesn&#x2019;t know me yet. I was a little careless.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">In Knight Saga, Nayatra was both a thief and assassin. If someone she didn&#x2019;t know called her name, it was natural for her to run away.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Carack was confused by the &#x2018;doesn&#x2019;t know me yet&#x2019; but didn&#x2019;t ask any more questions. Instead, he comforted In-gong like a good aide.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;It isn&#x2019;t Prince&#x2019;s fault. Prince isn&#x2019;t to blame. She is just too familiar with the area.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">His smiling expression was comforting. Was this why Karma, Delia and all the aides were crazy about Carack?</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">In-gong smiled after being reassured and spoke to the air,</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Green Wind, take a look around.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x2018;I understand Master.&#x2019;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Green Wind, who appeared in a solid state, turned into wind and disappeared. She would observe the area from a high location.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Carack, let&#x2019;s go to the slave trader who talked to Nayatra.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">In this current situation, it was In-gong&#x2019;s only clue. Perhaps he could get more information than expected.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">As he entered the store, the trader, who had spoken to Nayatra, came up to him first.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;How can I help you?&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;There is something that we want to ask you.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Carack smiled widely and handed some money to the trader. In-gong didn&#x2019;t know how much was given, but it seemed to be an appropriate amount judging by the trader&#x2019;s expression.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Unfortunately, the slave trader didn&#x2019;t know that much about Nayatra or how to contact her. He knew that Nayatra had visited once a few months ago and was very curious about the type and number of slaves being traded.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">When In-gong saw her, it had been her second visit. If there was a second visit, the possibility of a third visit was also high.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;I want to leave a letter.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">In-gong gave a few ancient gold coins from the dwarf inventory to the slave trader. The trader&#x2019;s face brightened at the unexpected windfall.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;I&apos;d be happy to lend you my writing instruments. Make yourself comfortable.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Based on his reaction, there was no need to worry about the letter not being delivered properly.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">In-gong thought for awhile before writing the letter.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">It was a letter with a brief description of how In-gong wanted to meet her as well as a way to contact him.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">At first, it seemed innocuous, but it contained a secret that Nayatra couldn&#x2019;t ignore.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">The next time Nayatra visited, the slave trader should contact In-gong after the letter was delivered, and he would be awarded with more ancient gold coins. Looking at his face, it seemed like In-gong&#x2019;s request would be fulfilled faithfully.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">As he handed the letter over, he heard Green Wind&#x2019;s voice in his ears. It was a crestfallen voice.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x2018;Master, I couldn&#x2019;t see her. I&apos;m sorry.&#x2019;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;No, good job. Thank you for the hard work.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">In-gong stroked Green Wind&#x2019;s head. Then he returned to the other slave stores and started questioning them about Nayatra.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">There were several more stores that she had visited with the purpose of knowing how many slaves they had.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">In-gong left letters at all those stores. Carak, who was watching from the side, reassured In-gong that anyone would be curious after seeing so many letters.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x2018;It isn&#x2019;t bad if I spend some money on Nayatra.&#x2019;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Just as In-gong received information from the slave traders, Nayatra could also get information about the letters.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">By the time he visited all the slave stores in Takar twice, it was late afternoon. It was now time to return to the hotel.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Even though In-gong returned to the accommodations with heavy steps, the atmosphere of the others were different.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x2018;The talking raccoon has become a happy raccoon.&apos;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Like Green Wind said, Amita had become happier as they sat on their tail eating sweets. Every time they ate, their body shook. So, they tried hard to maintain a calm expression.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;What type of candy is that?&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;I went to a sweets shop with Unni. Shutra and Carack should try it. It is really delicious.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Caitlin laughed at Carack&#x2019;s question and handed over the sweets. They looked like a bunch of mooncakes.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Although he didn&#x2019;t really like mooncakes, there was no way to turn down Caitlin&#x2019;s expectant eyes. In-gong picked up the smallest one and put it in his mouth.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;How is it? Delicious? Yes?&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Yes, delicious.&quot;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">It was as he had expected although the taste wasn&#x2019;t too bitter. It felt like he was eating a macaroon with a very high sugar content.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;Shutra? Did something bad happen?&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Caitlin inquired about In-gong&#x2019;s complexion. In-gong smiled and shook his head.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;I&#x2019;m just tired from walking around.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">However, the worry on Caitlin&#x2019;s face just increased further. Felicia frowned from where she was sitting on the couch and asked,</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Well, why don&#x2019;t you just rest and not go to the auction in the evening?&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;No, I don&#x2019;t know when I will be able to come again. I need to participate. And isn&#x2019;t there still a lot of time left? I will be fine after taking a break.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">They would leave Takar tomorrow afternoon with the reinforcements. So, if he missed this opportunity, there would be no way to participate in the auction for a while.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">He had missed Nayatra right in front of him, so he couldn&#x2019;t miss the auction.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Then I&apos;m glad. If there is any trouble, just tell me. You don&#x2019;t have to overdo it.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;I understand. Then I will get some rest first.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">In-gong entered the room that was assigned to him.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Then after approximately two hours...</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">The party of well dressed people gathered in the living room of the hotel.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Caitlin was wearing a cute yellow dress, revealing her shoulders which was unlike her usual style.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">As In-gong&#x2019;s eyes widened, Seira laughed and whispered to Carack. It seemed like her usual dresses were due to Chris.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Does it suit me?&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Caitlin asked with red cheeks. She was very excited about wearing a type of dress that she normally couldn&#x2019;t wear because of Chris.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">In-gong looked Caitlin up and down and laughed.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;Caitlin noona is great.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">As he mimicked Caitlin&#x2019;s reaction, Seira covered her mouth with her hands while Carack just laughed.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Caitlin looked coy, but it was only for a moment. Then she smiled widely again.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;What about me? Shutra, isn&#x2019;t this provocative compared to the Demon King&#x2019;s Palace?&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Unlike Caitlin, Felicia was wearing the same type of clothes. In other words, it was a purple dress with a high degree of exposure. Even though he was familiar with Felicia&#x2019;s style, In-gong still blushed for a moment.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Felicia laughed as she laid a shawl over her shoulders, then she evaluated In-gong&#x2019;s attire.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Black suits you well. Don&#x2019;t you look a little more mature?&quot;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">In-gong usually wore a white suit to the court gatherings.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">While Felicia and Caitlin were interested in In-gong&#x2019;s outfit, Seira and the other aides showed interest in Carack.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Delia approached Carack and said casually,</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Carack, your tie is crooked. I&#x2019;ll fix it.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Oh, thank you.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;It isn&#x2019;t a big deal.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Delia smiled gently as she stuck close to Carack, while Seira, Karma and Daphne&#x2019;s eyes widened.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">In-gong just sighed at the sight.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&apos;Nayatra can&#x2019;t be like this.&#x2019;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Of course, Nayatra still hadn&#x2019;t joined him.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Felicia laughed and approached In-gong.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Well, I&#x2019;ll fix Shutra&#x2019;s suit.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">In-gong had a bow tie, so there was nothing to fix, but he still accepted Felicia&#x2019;s helping hand.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&amp;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Even if Takar was the city of pleasure, the auction house was just an auction house.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Not only were that various valuables that could be seen in any auction house, there were also things traded in the underground market such as the slave trade. Therefore, a huge amount of money passed through there.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">The red auction house shone very brightly.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Sofas were arranged in a semi circle, and In-gong&#x2019;s party received a great spot in the center.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">In-gong looked around from where he was sitting between Felicia and Caitlin. Due to the bright room, it wasn&#x2019;t difficult to see the faces of those attending.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Then, I will start today&#x2019;s auction.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Everyone&#x2019;s attention became concentrated on the host, an incubus with red skin, who rang a bell on the stage. Amita, sitting on Daphne&#x2019;s lap, gazed at the stage with interested eyes and seemed to be feeling better due to the sweets.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">The auction was quite interesting, but In-gong was looking around instead of towards the stage.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&apos;My nerves are irritated.&#x2019;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Somehow, there were a few recognizable faces. He had seen these faces while playing Knight Saga.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">However, he didn&#x2019;t remember where he had seen them since they were either an extra or supporting character.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">In-gong was searching through his memories when he suddenly looked at the entrance of the auction house. Someone had come in late.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Their body was substantially larger than Carack&#x2019;s. He had a pale face, yellow eyes and scar over his right eye. The black hair wriggled randomly like it was alive.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">In-gong knew this face. Unlike the others, he clearly remembered where he had seen it.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x2018;Paratus.&#x2019;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">He was the brother of the barbarian king Karatus, who ruled over the Eastern Limit Line to the east of Evian.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">The memories continued... Paratus was one of the generals under the barbarian king.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Why had he appeared in Takar? Was it simply to participate in the auction?</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">In-gong shook my head. If Paratus coveted something, he would steal it, not buy it. It was clear that he had another reason.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Carack, something unusual is going to happen.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">In-gong whispered to Carack, who suddenly looked very serious.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;What is it?
