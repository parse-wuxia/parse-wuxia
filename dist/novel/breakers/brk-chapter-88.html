Who are you? Why do you smell of the sword duke? Are you friends of the sword duke?&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">The raccoon questioned in a sharp voice. Felicia pushed a hand against her temple and said in a confused voice,</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Wait a minute, wait a minute. Amita? A raccoon?&quot;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">The raccoon wasn&#x2019;t just a raccoon; its body was smaller than that of a regular raccoon and its cute round face was just like a baby raccoon&#x2019;s.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">However, as Amita spoke with a frown, it was obvious this wasn&#x2019;t an ordinary raccoon.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Why, are you resentful towards raccoons? Is this your first time seeing a talking raccoon?&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Oh, no, that isn&#x2019;t it... Ah, it is the first time I&#x2019;ve seen a talking raccoon but...&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">The confused Felicia stopped talking. It was a raccoon that wasn&#x2019;t simply a raccoon. Even Felicia, who had travelled all over the world, was in a state of panic.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">In-gong had met Amita three times in Knight Saga, but he was confused as well. Yet, he was somehow able to control his mind.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&apos;Anyway, they have appeared in various forms regardless of sex and age. They could also be a raccoon. Perhaps, this is the first time they&#x2019;ve transformed into a raccoon.&#x2019;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">When he thought about it, he realised It was plausible. Although it was a foreign story, there was a legend where someone had disguised as a raccoon.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">In-gong spoke politely,</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Amita, I am the 9th Prince of the Demon King&#x2019;s Palace. I came to find you with the sword duke&#x2019;s introduction.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">After In-gong&#x2019;s introduction, Amita flicked their eyes to Felicia. Felicia spoke in a similar manner to In-gong,</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;6th Princess Felicia Doomblade.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">They didn&#x2019;t come as people from the Demon King&#x2019;s Palace but as acquaintances of the sword duke. Amita&#x2019;s face relaxed as they liked the courtesy of the two people somewhat.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;The sword duke introduced me?&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Yes, we got our hands on good materials and he introduced us to the best craftsman.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Amita narrowed their eyes and looked In-gong up and down. Then their gaze turned towards In-gong&#x2019;s arms.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;That is a relic of an elder dragon.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Yes, they are from Watcher Ainkel and the Great Enkidu.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Amita&#x2019;s eyes narrowed even further. They covered their head with both hands and shook.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Ugh, okay. Normally, I would have kicked you out, but you came at the right time.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Judging from their words, they seemed to be deeply connected to the situation here. Felicia lowered herself and asked Amita,</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Amita, what is going on? Can you explain?&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;The story is a bit long. So, understand it quickly.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">They looked Felicia up and down before sitting on their tail.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;I have been staying in the centre of Spider Forest for months. I was thinking about moving to another place in six months, but then suddenly, something happened. Odd creatures covered in a purple aura struck Spider Forest.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">The expressions in Felicia&#x2019;s and In-gong&#x2019;s eyes changed.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Amita laughed and asked,</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;Why? Do you know these guys?&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;I fought with monsters covered in a purple aura on Enger Plains. Their purpose was to eliminate the guardian of Enger Plains.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Amita scowled at In-gong&#x2019;s description.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;This was done by professionals. Anyway, the guardian of Spider Forest became involved, so I decided to stop them. This is a place where the lycanthrope rangers patrol routinely; I thought that the lycanthropes would be able to resolve the issue if I blocked the monsters properly.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">That reminded In-gong about the white giant was striking against a transparent wall. Amita had lived for a long time, so it wasn&#x2019;t impossible that they knew a variety of techniques.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;The problem is... the ones with the purple aura aren&#x2019;t the only ones involved.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">In-gong and Felicia nodded. In fact, while fighting in this forest, they hadn&#x2019;t seen a single monster with a purple aura. Moreover, the spirits on Enger Plains hadn&#x2019;t gone crazy like the spirits here were currently doing.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Amita spoke with a sigh,</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;These guys are aiming for the last flame. They are enemies &#x2014; people who had been seeking the last flame in the past. Additionally, the moon is green and all the spirits in the forest have gone crazy.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;What type of people are they?&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">The druid Daphne asked with a look mixed with curiosity and fear. Amita responded like they were reluctant to continue speaking,</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;They were guardians once but have now become crazy. They covet the power of the last flame.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;Is the last flame that good?&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;I don&#x2019;t know. It is doubtful that they will be able absorb it, but it is true that the last flame is a very mysterious and wonderful thing. They seem to believe that if they absorb the last flame... they will return to the past, before they had gone crazy.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Amita was a very good craftsman. However, it wasn&#x2019;t their strength that was nestled in making the divine armor; It was the strength of the last flame that they used when making the armor.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">It was obvious that the &#x2018;first flame&#x2019; from the legend wouldn&#x2019;t be ordinary.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Anyway, I reinforced the ward in order to prevent them from coming in. The guardian of Spider Forest had to be protected urgently. As a result, the ward has become stronger... but I can&#x2019;t run away. The last flame is stuck to a vein. It isn&#x2019;t permanent and I can remove it, but it will take time.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">The most important thing to Amita was the last flame. They felt sorry for the guardian of Spider Forest, but Spider Forest wasn&#x2019;t its main concern.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;The crazy guardians have joined forces with the ones surrounded by a purple aura. They have both become stronger and today, another ward was broken. Now, there is only one ward remaining.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">It was clear that the white giant had cracked the transparent wall.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Felicia asked in a serious voice,</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Amita, what will happen if the last flame goes out?&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;I don&#x2019;t know. So far, I&#x2019;ve never seen it go out. The possibility is low, but... maybe the world will perish like in the rumours.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Amita responded bitterly. They didn&#x2019;t know what was going to happen, so they were even more impatient.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Is the sword duke in the area?&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;No.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Amita sighed at In-gong&#x2019;s answer. In-gong understood their mind. If the sword duke was here, he would be able to resolve the issue in a minute.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Rotten. At any rate, I need you.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Amita stood on two legs and alternated between looking at In-gong and Felicia. In particular, Felicia&#x2019;s heart weakened as she looked at their moist eyes.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;6th Princess and 9th Prince, help me. You must defend the last flame and Spider Forest. Stop them. Keep the royal family&#x2019;s pride and obligations.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Felicia nodded reflexively as she heard &#x2018;the royal family&#x2019;s pride and obligations.&#x2019; However, at that moment, there was a sharp voice,</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;Wait! Wait a minute!&quot;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">It was Carack who had been staying silent until now. In-gong and Felicia were surprised by Carack&#x2019;s interruption, but Carack didn&#x2019;t care. He showed his stubborness by crossing his arms and looking down at Amita.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;What will you do in return if Prince and Princess help you?&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;What?&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;The price, the price. Surely, you don&#x2019;t intend for us to risk our lives for nothing?&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Felicia and Delia looked like they were shocked by Carack&#x2019;s words. However, Felicia then gave a strange smile while In-gong decided to simply watch.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Amita looked between In-gong and Felicia, then tapped their chest like they were frustrated.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Aren&#x2019;t you listening to me? It is an unprecedented situation where the last flame might go out!&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;You said that you don&#x2019;t know what will happen if it goes out. Maybe nothing will happen when the last flame is extinguished.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Carack spoke in a subtle and strangely convincing voice.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Amita shook their fist like it was ridiculous and their tail tapped the floor as they shouted,</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Okay, the reason you came to me in the first place was for a commission. I will make one piece of desired equipment for Prince and Princess. How about that?&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Amita&#x2019;s gaze was directed at Carack, not In-gong and Felicia.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Carack shook his head with a resolute expression.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;That is lacking. The cute and pretty girl sleeping here is the 8th Princess. She struggled with the enemies and lost consciousness. Additionally, all of us have to risk our lives. I don&#x2019;t think that the lives of Prince and Princess are so cheap. There are also the lives of Delia, Seira, Daphne and Green Wind.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Carack only omitted Robin. Whether it was deliberate or he had really forgotten, no one knew.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Amita pressed a hand to their forehead and sat on their tail like they were dizzy.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;You- Don&#x2019;t you know how much my pieces are worth?&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;I don&#x2019;t know. Do I need to know?&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Was it courage or ignorance?</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Before Carack&#x2019;s shamelessness, Amita had blanked out. They tried gazing at In-gong and Felicia for help, but it was useless.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;Okay, okay. I will do what you want. I will make one piece of equipment for all of you. Are you satisfied now?&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">It was truly an excellent proposal, but Carack shook his head once again.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;There is one more colleague who went to call for reinforcements. She is a very precious companion and Prince&#x2019;s essential subordinate.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">In-gong nodded when he thought about Karma. He only had two knights, so it was true that she was essential.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Amita jumped up.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Up to there! Beyond that, no more!&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;Understood. One piece for Karma who is calling for reinforcements and one piece each for everyone here... Do you promise?&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Yes, I promise.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Amita waved their hands. Carack laughed and glanced at In-gong and Felicia.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;What do Prince and Princess think?&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;I&#x2019;ll do it.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;I will accept.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">When he replied, In-gong was looking at Amita instead of Carack. Amita scowled at the hateful master and servant before speaking,</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;I will return to the center of the forest. You aren&#x2019;t spirits, so there is a danger of losing your way if you follow me. Tomorrow morning, the illusions will disappear, so come to the center of the forest. If you hold this, you will be able to pass through the ward that I put up.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Amita pulled out leaves from their arms and pushed them toward In-gong. The leaves looked sophisticated and real but were actually made of metal.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;I understand.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Then I will see you tomorrow.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Amita sighed, seemingly exhausted, and jumped into the bushes.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Then after one minute, once In-gong was convinced that Amita was gone, he shrugged and asked,</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Doesn&#x2019;t it feel like a storm has passed by?&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">It was truly felt like that. Moreover, the conversation with Amita had headed in an unexpected direction.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Carack scratched his head and said,</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;I&#x2019;m sorry if I went overboard. I had no choice as Prince&#x2019;s proud aide.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">It made a lot of sense as out of a sense of royal pride and duty, they would have accepted the request regardless.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Felicia smiled pleasantly and reassured him,</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;Well, the results are good. The more equipment we have which are made by Amita, the better off we will be. However, I am a little worried. What if it isn&#x2019;t made properly due to Amita&#x2019;s anger?&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;That won&#x2019;t happen. They seem to have a great deal of pride. They will definitely make it correctly.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Carack hadn&#x2019;t pushed Amita without thinking it through. If he was afraid of defective products like Felicia, he would have gone for a different approach.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">In-gong nodded.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;I agree with Carack. Their name will go on it, so they will never create something bad.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Amita was such a person. Moreover, it would be divine equipment made from the last flame. If shoddy equipment was made, it would indeed be blasphemy.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;Yes, it is great. Well done.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Amita wasn&#x2019;t a common craftsman but one that they were lucky to gain a commision from.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Since it was unlikely to have an ongoing relationship with them, it was better to receive as many benefits as possible.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Carack laughed when Felicia praised him honestly.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;I&#x2019;m glad to be of help.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Not only Felicia but Daphne and Delia also looked at Carack with a smile. In particular, the two of them had more than respect in their eyes. It was like they were gazing at a man with great vitality.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x2018;Indeed, someone who manages to get Carack as a husband won&#x2019;t starve.&#x2019;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">In-gong nodded inadvertently and took a deep breath.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Anyway... I guess this incident is certainly not normal.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">With the last flame tied up in the issue, the situation was a mess. Amita wasn&#x2019;t sure if the world would be destroyed if the last flame was extinguished, but it would be a shame for the sacred flame to disappear anyway.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Moreover, it was noteworthy that there were monsters with a purple aura in Spider Forest, similar to those previously in the Enger Plains.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">What was their purpose? Why did they attack?</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;However, we can&#x2019;t take a step back. As Amita said, we are royalty. It is our duty to protect the guardian of Spider Forest and the last flame. We have to protect Spider Forest until Karma calls for reinforcements.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Felicia declared before turning her gaze towards the sky. In-gong looked up as well.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">The green moon was fading away.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&amp;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;What, why did the number of people increase again?&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Talking raccoon, I was beside Master yesterday. I should also get my share.&quot;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;A talking raccoon is amazing!&#x201D;</span></p><hr><div><br></div><p><br></p><p><br></p></div><p><br></p>
