Of course, they had to consider the air flow, but it wasn&#x2019;t like a carriage that had to go through a mountain or get past a river.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">In order to get to the Lycanthropes&#x2019; Palace from Spider Forest, they had to reach the lycanthrope territory and then cross half of it.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">It would take more than 10 days on land, but it was a different story with a flying ship.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Sepira, the vice captain and navigator, calculated that it would take two to three days to reach the palace.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">During that time, the party didn&#x2019;t sit quietly.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Amita, who was in Daphne&#x2019;s arms as always, gathered everyone in the captain&#x2019;s room, the largest room on the airship.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Now that the rough preparations are over, I will receive individual orders.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">The look on Amita&#x2019;s face almost looked like a human expression. It was the expression of someone who didn&#x2019;t want to do a chore but had accepted it anyway.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Tell me the equipment you each desire.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Daphne was the first one to reply to Amita&#x2019;s words. She caressed Amita&#x2019;s fur and said,</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;I want armor, as I mentioned before.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Yes, I&#x2019;ll make a dress with embroidered protective spells.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Amita smiled and nodded. It seemed like they had already talked many times about what Daphne wanted.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Carack blinked and asked,</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Huh? Raccoon person, is that possible? Isn&#x2019;t it tough for you to sew?&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;Why, do you have a complaint? Eh? Do you have a complaint?&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Amita snarled at Carack, but the rest of the group just looked at Amita&#x2019;s little hands. The thought of a raccoon sewing with those hands was very cute.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Carack also had similar thoughts, but instead of teasing them, he just replied with a wide smile,</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;No, raccoon person is very talented.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;Bah.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Amita snorted, but they didn&#x2019;t hate the praise.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Well, let&#x2019;s keep going. Satyr, tell me your order.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Karma stared at Amita, then said in a cautious voice,</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;I will ask for armor.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">She hadn&#x2019;t participated in the fight to defend the last flame as well as the negotiation.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Amita looked Karma up and down after hearing her order.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;You prefer speed, so I&#x2019;ll have to make it light. It will be a partial armour. Okay, next.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Amita&#x2019;s gaze turned to Seira this time and she responded with a serious expression,</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;I need armour that can be worn after a transformation.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Well, I guess I&#x2019;ll need to make resizeable armor. It depends on the material, but the armour will basically be heavier, so the defense is higher. Is that want you want?&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Some weight is okay. I&#x2019;ll use it after the transformation. I just want you to consider that I&#x2019;m a warrior who uses my fists.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Understood. I will take it into account. ...You?&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Amita&#x2019;s voice abruptly changed at the end. It was because Carack was the target.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Carack scratched his chin and grinned.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;I also want armor.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">After Karma and Seira, that made three consecutive orders for armor. Daphne&#x2019;s order of clothes also belonged to the category of armor, so all the orders from the party so far had been armor.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Amita jumped from Daphne&#x2019;s arms and pounded the floor with their tail.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Why are the orders all armor? Isn&#x2019;t this too much? Eh? Armour is the hardest, so are you trying to mess with me?&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">The biggest piece of equipment was armour.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Carack waved his hands and shook his head like there was a misunderstanding.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Armor is necessary. Who wouldn&#x2019;t want sturdy armor with the purpose of keeping them alive to come from the best craftsman? Moreover, Karma, Seira and I are the escorts of princes and princess. There are many things to be done, so it is natural that we need armor.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">It was a logical claim for an orc.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Amita couldn&#x2019;t come up with any way to refute it, so they sighed and shook their fists. Sepira, who was standing with Silvan in a corner, stared at Carack with amazement.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Delia noticed the gaze and moved to block Sepira&#x2019;s view. Amita jumped back onto Daphne&#x2019;s lap and looked at Delia.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;You? Do you also want armor?&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Delia was an aide like Carack and Seira.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">However, Delia shook her head.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Amita, I want a shield that is small and light but has good defense and a wide range of defenses.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Delia was a dark elf and dark elves were usually highly exposed. Exposed armor naturally had a low defense, so instead of flimsy armor, she wanted a shield.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">At Delia&#x2019;s order, Carack and the others all looked at Amita nervously. Delia&#x2019;s order was quite contradictory, so they thought Amita would become angry.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">A shield that was small and light, yet it should have excellent defense and a wide defense range. Was that even possible?</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;A shield. It is for defense, but it isn&#x2019;t armour. Okay, I like it.&quot;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">It was likely that it was possible.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Amita nodded and Delia smiled as she returned to her seat.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">The aides finished making their orders, so the only remaining ones were the royal children.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Amita turned to Caitlin first.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;What about the amazing princess?&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;Uh... um...&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Caitlin licked her lips and didn&#x2019;t answer immediately because she couldn&#x2019;t make a decision between armor and gauntlets.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Caitlin had grown up among lycanthropes who never used weapons, so she had never thought about using weapons. It was because she didn&#x2019;t think there was a weapon that a fists warrior could use.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">However, Caitlin&#x2019;s thoughts changed &#xA0;somewhat after seeing In-gong use Earth Quaker.&#xA0;</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">She wanted to have gauntlets that she could use as a weapon.&#xA0;</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">However, she would also like to have armor.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">While Caitlin was worrying about it, Amita started to wave their tail with impatience.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Amidst everyone&#x2019;s nervousness, In-gong pulled Caitlin&#x2019;s hand and whispered to her,</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;Ask for armor. I&#x2019;ll give you gauntlets from my share.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Caitlin&#x2019;s eyes shone at In-gong&#x2019;s suggestion.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;Really? Is it okay?&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Everybody became curious because Caitlin&#x2019;s reply wasn&#x2019;t a whisper. In-gong grinned and nodded.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;Yes, it is.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">In-gong was supposed to receive a full set from Amita.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Gauntlets and a shield were included in the full set, but In-gong already had Earth Quaker and White Eagle. So, the gauntlets and shield would be best placed somewhere else.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Caitlin would receive the gauntlets and Carack would get the shield.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">It was the reason Carack selected armor instead of a shield.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Thanks to In-gong&#x2019;s consideration, Caitlin&#x2019;s worries were relieved and she smiled brightly.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;Please make me armor. Light and sturdy armor should be good.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">It was the sixth defense and fifth armor order. Amita sighed as their shoulders sagged.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;I am going to be an armor craftsman. Okay, I will do it since it is your order.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Amita, whose expression had become aloof, turned toward Felicia.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;What do you want? Armor?&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">The word &#x2018;armor&#x2019; emerged from Amita&#x2019;s mouth, but their eyes were full of expectations.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Felicia was a dark elf like Delia. So, right now, she was wearing clothes that exposed her belly and her shoulders.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Felicia, who received Amita&#x2019;s burning gaze, covered her face with her fan. She looked somewhere else and said,</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;A sword.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Sword...</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">It wasn&#x2019;t a shield or armor but a sword.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;Huh? Aren&#x2019;t you a magician?&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Amita asked with startled eyes. Felicia raised her fan a little bit higher and replied,</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;I&apos;m not using it. Please make a sword for Silvan.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;Felicia?&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Startled, Silvan cried out. Felicia glanced at him and muttered in a small voice,</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Well, I am a magician. I have no need for weapons or armor.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Her face was covered with a fan, but her long ears had turned red. Everyone smiled warmly as they saw Felicia&#x2019;s red ears.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;Felicia!&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Silvan was unable to hold back and pulled Felicia into a hug. They were a twin brother and sister, but the two of them were quite different. Felicia cried out from within Silvan&#x2019;s arms,</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Oh, come on! Do you want me to change my order?&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">However, her face was still red. Instead of releasing Felicia, Silvan chuckled and kissed her forehead and cheeks.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;You know that Oppa loves you right?&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;I know.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Felicia responded with a small smile and Silvan laughed like he was someone who had obtained the world.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Amita nodded with a cheery expression.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;I love you too. A sword, good.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">The seventh order was a weapon.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">However, there was still a long way to go. Amita sighed as they looked at the person whose order would be the same amount as the previous ones combined.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;A full set... So, full body armour, shield and a helmet?&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">The full set also included earrings and nose rings.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">In-gong replied with a grin that was similar to Carack&#x2019;s.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Please tune Earth Quaker and White Eagle as well, thank you.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;The last flame...&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Amita lamented, but the last flame was on In-gong&#x2019;s side. Moreover, Amita still had one more trial remaining.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Speaking raccoon, don&#x2019;t forget about me. I also need to give my order.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Green Wind appeared next to In-gong. Amita looked up at Green Wind and didn&#x2019;t have the power to tap the floor with their tail anymore.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;What would you like?&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Well, I want to have something that can help Master. I am Master&#x2019;s and Master is mine. Master, what would you like?&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">The words were good for In-gong but terrible for Amita. Not just the orc, but the master and subordinates were all vicious.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">In-gong smiled and stroked Green Wind&#x2019;s head.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;I want a special order. It is also related to the adjustment of Earth Quaker and White Eagle, so I think we should talk some more.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;It is as Master says.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Green Wind smiled at Amita who nodded.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Yes, I&#x2019;ll talk to you again later. Anyway... this flying ship has a fairly large smithy. I&#x2019;ll start working there. Also, 9th Prince.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Amita got up and pointed at In-gong.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Will there be a smithy at your mansion in the Demon King&#x2019;s Palace?&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;Yes.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">In fact, it didn&#x2019;t have a smithy.
