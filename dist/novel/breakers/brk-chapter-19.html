Did Chris and Caitlin know about it?</p><p>Both Chris and Caitlin thought about it instead of answering In-gong directly. However, that was only for a moment. Chris shook his head.</p><p>&#x201C;I don&#x2019;t know, I&#x2019;ve never heard of it. Caitlin, do you know?&#x201D;</p><p>Caitlin&#x2019;s response was a little more sincere than Chris&#x2019; but the result wasn&#x2019;t different. Just like Chris, she shook her head.</p><p>&quot;I don&apos;t know. Is that a nickname for someone? Is it a warrior on your side?&#x201D;</p><p>Conquest Knight. They never heard of it. It was quite interesting.</p><p>Even Chris, who liked stories of warriors, didn&#x2019;t know?</p><p>Chris clapped his hands.</p><p>&#x201C;Yes, there is a possibility. Shutra, do you have a warrior called a Conquest Knight? I would like a knight like that.&#x201D;</p><p>His eyes lit up at the story. In-gong laughed awkwardly and waved his hands.</p><p>&quot;No, it is the same for me. I just remembered hearing it from somewhere.&#x201D;</p><p>It was pretty dangerous when he thought about it.</p><p>In-gong didn&#x2019;t know what a Conquest Knight was yet. In other words, it meant that other people could be Conquest Knights.</p><p>What if Conquest Knights were a danger to Chris and Caitlin?</p><p>&#x2018;Caitlin and Chris...&#x2019;</p><p>No, even Caitlin might want to harm him.</p><p>&apos;I was too hasty. I shouldn&#x2019;t have mentioned it.&#x2019;</p><p>He needed to find out as much as possible about Conquest Knights by himself. In-gong realized that he shouldn&#x2019;t talk about Conquest Knights.</p><p>&#x2018;The risk is too much.&#x2019;</p><p>In-gong controlled his mind and concentrated on the front again.</p><p>&#x2018;It isn&#x2019;t all smoke and water... If Chris and Caitlin don&#x2019;t know, should I go to the library?&#x2019;</p><p>It wasn&#x2019;t an entirely new thought but he went back to it after not finding any clues. There might be a record there.</p><p>&#x2018;In the end, it is just a feeling.&#x2019;</p><p>No, was it really a feeling?</p><p>The white woman with a golden crown. The red flame-like woman. The skinny man dressed in a black robe and the blue man wearing a skull helmet.</p><p>The appearances of the four people became a blur in his head. In-gong felt dizzy.</p><p>&quot;Hey, are you okay? Are you not feeling well?&#x201D;</p><p>Chris, who had been walking ahead, looked back. He called out with surprise as In-gong&#x2019;s eyes rolled back and he stumbled.</p><p>&#x201C;Hey?</p><p>&quot;Ah, it is nothing. I&#x2019;m still a bit sleepy.&#x201D;</p><p>In-gong rubbed his eyes like he was sleepy and gave a small yawn. Chris made a &#x2018;hah&#x2019; sound and turned back to the front.</p><p>&quot;Aigoo, you are still a kid. You should have been mentally prepared from the moment the operation started.&#x201D;</p><p>He was saying insults but his eyes were smiling. In-gong had thought so since they first met, but Chris was just like a nice neighbourhood hyung.</p><p>&#x201C;Do you want water?&#x201D;</p><p>Caitlin extended a canteen from where she was walking next to him. She was making the same expression as Chris.</p><p>&#x201C;Thank you.&#x201D;</p><p>In-gong wasn&#x2019;t particularly thirsty but he took the canteen and took a sip. Throughout the past few days, she had been acting like a really friendly noona.</p><p>Although In-gong had only met them for a few days, he could tell how close they were to each other. It was understandable since Chris and Caitlin were lycanthropes.</p><p>&#x2018;It will be a nightmare if one of them dies.&#x2019;</p><p>When Caitlin died, Chris would go wild. If Chris died, then Caitlin would go on a rampage. That&#x2019;s why they were called blood-crazed beasts.</p><p>In-gong handed the canteen back to Caitlin and looked to the front, where he saw Chris staring back at them. Chris just smiled before turning away again.</p><p>In-gong had a sudden thought.</p><p>&#x2018;Does Chris know?&#x2019;</p><p>Did he know that Caitlin wasn&#x2019;t the child of the Demon King? That her father was Gallehed, one of the five captains?</p><p>There was barely a two year difference between Chris and Caitlin. Chris had only been a baby when Caitlin was born.</p><p>However, Chris was part of the lycanthropes&#x2019; royal family. As the son of the 4th Queen Elaine Moonlight and the Demon King, he had grown up to become king of the lycanthropes.</p><p>It was difficult to imagine that he didn&#x2019;t know about Caitlin, the lycanthropes&#x2019; greatest weakness.</p><p>&#x2018;And...&#x2019;</p><p>In-gong glanced towards Caitlin. She kept walking forward as she responded affectionately to In-gong&#x2019;s gaze.</p><p>&#x201C;What? Do you want more water?&#x201D;</p><p>&quot;No, I am fine.&#x201D;</p><p>In-gong looked ahead again.</p><p>Caitlin Moonlight. A year before the Day of Massacre, she would be the starting point for a huge civil war among the children of the Demon King.</p><p>Did she even know? The fact that she wasn&#x2019;t the child of the Demon King?</p><p>&apos;I have to slowly find out.&#x2019;</p><p>In-gong stepped forward. The cave wasn&#x2019;t far.</p><p>&amp;</p><p>They had already walked on this path once, so the party&#x2019;s marching speed was fast.</p><p>Once they reached the part of the cave where the rock spiders came out, Seira and her lycanthropes split into three passages while Carack and Chris&#x2019; elite troops entered another with In-gong, Chris and Caitlin following behind.</p><p>Upon arriving at the dwarf portal, the lycanthrope magicians Chris brought started to examine the portal. They seemed to roughly know the dwarf language.</p><p>&quot;Shutra, I&#x2019;m not doubting you. I just need to confirm it. Isn&#x2019;t this type of procedure necessary?&#x201D;</p><p>Chris laughed as he spoke towards In-gong. No matter how much he believed in In-gong, it was a necessary procedure. There was a possibility that In-gong&#x2019;s interpretation was wrong.</p><p>&quot;It&apos;s okay. I already guessed that.&#x201D;</p><p>In-gong replied while observing the magicians. Due to the fact that they were lycanthropes, the magicians were all muscular.</p><p>The mysterious magicians decrypted the dwarf characters and spoke to Chris.</p><p>&quot;Prince Chris, it is just like Prince Shutra said. This portal is connected to the Eska branch of the Jishuka Mountains.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Will the portal work normally?&#x201D;</p><p>The magicians pointed to the magic spell underneath the characters and replied to Chris.</p><p>&quot;It seems to work. Dwarven goods are unbeatable.&#x201D;</p><p>Dwarf-made objects were masterpieces in the Demon World. Chris nodded and looked at In-gong and Caitlin.</p><p>&quot;Okay, let&#x2019;s move.&#x201D;</p><p>Moving through the portal was simple. Once the magician inserted magic power into the circle, a blue and round gate appeared. After passing through it, they arrived in front of the other portal.</p><p>&quot;How is it? It isn&#x2019;t anything special right?&#x201D;</p><p>Caitlin laughed and patted his shoulder. In-gong nodded with surprise.</p><p>&quot;Yes, it wasn&#x2019;t anything special.&#x201D;</p><p>He had been worried about what would happen once he entered the blue gate but he didn&#x2019;t feel anything.</p><p>&#x2018;Isn&#x2019;t this called a space jump?&#x2019;</p><p>It was space movement, not a space jump. At first glance, it seemed the same. However, there was a big difference.</p><p>Of course, In-gong had no way of knowing what the difference was. He didn&#x2019;t know much about it.</p><p>&quot;Stay alert. The passages haven&#x2019;t been secured yet. Don&#x2019;t forget that we still don&#x2019;t know where the passage exit leads to.&#x201D;</p><p>Chris started to explore the passage ahead with the lycanthropes. It was completely different from the relaxed figure he showed at the base.</p><p>&apos;Yes, he is this type of person.&#x2019;</p><p>Caitlin also stayed silent with a serious expression after hearing Chris&#x2019; words. He looked back and Carack had a strict and serious expression on his face as well.</p><p>Fortunately, the passage with Portal Three was much shorter compared to the one with Portal Two.</p><p>In-gong used the mini-map and found a door that Carack cracked open.</p><p>&#x201C;Phew, I feel better now.&#x201D;</p><p>Fresh air flooded in from the open door. It was a windy area.</p><p>&#x201C;A mountain slope? Okay, let&#x2019;s examine it.&#x201D;</p><p>Chris muttered and gave a signal. The lycanthropes immediately left the cave at a swift pace.</p><p>&quot;We are going. Be careful.&#x201D;</p><p>This time, Chris moved in the front, followed by In-gong, Caitlin and Carack.</p><p>Chris covered up the entrance of the cave with rocks, dead tree branches and grass so that it was almost invisible.</p><p>&quot;Okay, this looks good.&#x201D;</p><p>Chris said while looking down the mountain. Without realising it, In-gong exclaimed with admiration,</p><p>&quot;Wow!&quot;</p><p>The Red Lightning tribe was spread out under the mountain. If he included the non-combatants, there were more than 5,000 people, so it was incomparable to Caitlin&#x2019;s base.</p><p>&#x201C;The food warehouses are a priority when attacking from the rear. While Vandal strikes from the front, a unit will infiltrate the rear to burn the food warehouses.&#x201D;</p><p>Chris said while pointing to a corner. His voice sounded quite sinister.</p><p>However, Caitlin, who was looking at the entire base, shook her head.</p><p>&quot;It is strange. There aren&#x2019;t that many troops.&#x201D;</p><p>&quot;Eh? Come to think of it?&#x201D;</p><p>It wasn&#x2019;t night yet but there were very few orcs at the base.</p><p>Chris, Caitlin and In-gong looked into the distance. Their mouths dropped open at the same time.</p><p>At the plains in front of the base...</p><p>Two different armies were clashing.</p><hr><p><br></p><p><br></p></div><p><br></p>
