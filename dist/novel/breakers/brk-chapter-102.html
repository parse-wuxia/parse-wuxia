There were also those who made welcoming gestures.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">A sailboat with dark sails was riding the wind.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">It was the flagship of the 5th Prince, Silvan Doomblade.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">The Black Flame Dragon had arrived at the Demon King&#x2019;s Palace.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&amp;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">They had not planned anything in advance. However, Chris and Felicia exchanged glances and got into the most appropriate formation.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">In-gong was the first one to get off after Silvan&#x2019;s crew members put out the folding staircase.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">In-gong was immediately followed by Carack, while Chris and Felicia each took on a position to their left and right so that the two men were in the center. As always, Caitlin and Silvan stood beside Chris and Felicia. The rest of the aides, except Carack, followed their masters, creating a formation that centered naturally around In-gong.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">This formation had symbolic meaning.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">A rectangular table formation like this didn&#x2019;t exist without reason.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">The center of the group...</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Was the one who led the group.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Not only had five children of the demon king gathered together, but they were acting together.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">5th Prince, 6th Princess, 7th Prince and 8th Princess...</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">They represented the royal families of the dark elves and the lycanthropes.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Why were they moving together? Who tied them together?</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">The answer was clear.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Just by looking, they could tell who was leading the crowd.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">It was 9th Prince Shutra Ignus...</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">The one who had defeated the Red Lightning tribe with 7th Prince and 8th Princess.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">During the mission, he had rescued the 6th Princess and the 6th Princess showed her devotion by helping 9th Prince.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Additionally, the 5th Prince was added since he couldn&#x2019;t stand to fight with the 6th Princess.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Their suspicions became certain.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Some were happy while others felt discomfort.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">However, all of them understood intuitively.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">A new faction had emerged in the Demon King&#x2019;s Palace.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">The youngest and so called Prince of Scraps, Shutra Ignus, was the head of that new faction.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">In-gong smiled bitterly as he descended the folding stairs under the flood of gazes. He couldn&#x2019;t tell what they were thinking through their eyes and facial expressions alone, but he knew.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;This is overwhelming.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">When he first visited, there had been no one to greet him and the second visit only had Felicia&#x2019;s aides.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Then the third visit...</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Everyone was paying attention to In-gong. Moreover, this time there was someone who came out to greet In-gong.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Flora, the butler for his residence at the Demon King&#x2019;s Palace, stood with two people. As always, Flora seemed somewhat expressionless, so In-gong sighed when he saw her.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;I&apos;m glad.&quot;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;What are you glad about?&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Flora still seems the same.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Carack cocked his head at In-gong&#x2019;s words but In-gong just smiled.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">He didn&#x2019;t want Flora to look at Carack like Karma, Seira, Delia, Sephira and Daphne did.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">In-gong erased his smile as he had almost completely descended from the folding stairs. Then he heard Silvan&#x2019;s voice behind him,</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;There are draconians. They seem to be hiding, but they can&#x2019;t fool my eyes...&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;I smell the nightmares. Everybody has shown up. Don&#x2019;t you like this?&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Chris said, cutting off Silvan&#x2019;s words as he was talking.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Unlike Silvan&#x2019;s haughty voice, Chris&#x2019; was mixed with the snarl of a predator.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Draconians and nightmares had come out. There were none in the group, so they hadn&#x2019;t come out to welcome the party. It was either reconnaissance or spying.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">It showed that they were aware of the group.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">In-gong couldn&#x2019;t be ignored.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;It is great to see 9th Prince.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Flora bowed to In-gong. Subsequently, the servants in charge of Felicia&#x2019;s and Chris&#x2019; mansion were gathered.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">There were some concubine children who had greeted him on the second visit and some unfamiliar faces.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">In-gong ordered Flora to move the baggage from the Black Flame Dragon to the mansion. Although In-gong had virtually no baggage, Amita had a lot.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Daphne, who was hugging Amita, decided to go with Flora. Additionally, Amita had already agreed to act like a normal raccoon. It was Amita&#x2019;s request since they didn&#x2019;t want to be involved in any troublesome business.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Felicia and Chris entrusted their baggage to their stewards and accompanied In-gong instead of heading back to their residences.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">As a result, their aides joined the party and a group of over 20 people were moving together. Moreover, In-gong was the leader of this group.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&apos;Returning home in glory.&#x2019;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">There were many concubine children who wanted to talk to In-gong. Among them were Silas and Selene whom In-gong had wanted to secure like Daphne.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">He didn&#x2019;t have to go personally to each person in order to recruit talented individuals. Another way to recruit talent was to create a power that would make the talent come find him.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">In-gong moved toward the Merits Department.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">His followers, including the concubine children, scattered in front of the Merits Department, but there was still many remaining.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">There were five of the demon king&#x2019;s children and their four aides.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Isabella, who was in charge of the Merits Department, smiled with admiration and confusion as the room felt narrower than usual.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;9th Prince is always surprising me.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Her lamia tail waved pleasantly. The smile of a beauty was always pleasant, so In-gong laughed alone when a voice interrupted them.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Isabella, I&#x2019;m here as well.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Chris grinned playfully. It would be embarrassing under other situations, but it was different with the children of the demon king who were close to Isabella. She laughed like she was accustomed to Chris&#x2019; frivolity and gave an exaggerated bow.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Of course, I know. It has been awhile since I&#x2019;ve seen 7th Prince at the Merits Department.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Chris was satisfied with the intimate tone. Then another voice was heard,</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Me too.&quot;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;Yes, 5th Prince, I know. I&#x2019;m very pleased to see 6th Prince and 8th Princess.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x2018;She is like a nanny to children.&#x2019;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">In fact, Isabella had seen the children of the demon king since they were children. She even had a friendly attitude to Zephyr. Maybe 1st Prince Baikal and 4th Princess Anastasia wouldn&#x2019;t be much different.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">He didn&#x2019;t know if it was a way to deal with the demon king&#x2019;s children or due to friendship, but Isabella didn&#x2019;t get involved in any political problems such as factions.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">She only greeted In-gong today as a representative of the Merits Department.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;9th Prince, what can I do for you today?&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;I want to install a new facility in my mansion.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&amp;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;This scammer! This isn&#x2019;t a smithy!&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Amita burst out and pounded their tail on the ground.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">In-gong had just installed it, so the smithy was virtually empty.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Now, there will be one. Amita can decorate it as you like. It will be your private smithy. If you have anything you want, please say so at any time.&quot;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Amita responded to In-gong&#x2019;s friendly words by covering their face with their hands.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Ohh, somehow, I have an ominous feeling like I can never escape from this place...&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">They needed to create more than a dozen equipment. So, an extended stay was required, no matter how good Amita was.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">While Amita was pessimistic about their future, Daphne took out a blue collar.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Amita, this is a necklace. All pets in the Demon King&#x2019;s Palace must have necklaces. Don&#x2019;t forget to act normal.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Amita&#x2019;s necklace was truly a dog&#x2019;s collar. Amita looked up at Daphne with a bemused expression for a moment.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;You&#x2014; Are you enjoying this?&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;Aye, that is impossible.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Daphne laughed and Amita gave a long sigh. They seemed to have given up.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&apos;I&#x2019;m glad I have Daphne.&#x2019;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">It seemed like he could leave Amita to Daphne.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">In-gong moved the materials in his inventory to one side of the smithy, then headed for the salon room of the mansion. Felicia, Silvan, Chris and Caitlin were gathered in the salon room.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;The aides?&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;They are having a separate tea time. Shouldn&#x2019;t the counselors have time to rest as well?&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">In-gong slightly frowned at Felicia&#x2019;s answer as an image of Carack sitting in a&#xA0;</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">flower garden</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#xA0;popped into his head.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">In-gong felt angry and Caitlin looked at him curiously.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;Shutra?&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;No, it is nothing.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">In-gong erased the image of Carack in a flower garden and sat down between Caitlin and Felicia.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Unlike Caitlin, Felicia laughed like she knew what In-gong had been imagining.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Anyway, there will be a court gathering in two days. Apart from this alliance, there will be Baikal orabeoni, Zephyr orabeoni, Victor orabeoni and Anastasia unni... All of the children of the demon king will be there.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Even in Knight Saga, there hadn&#x2019;t been a case of all the demon king&#x2019;s children attending a court gathering. In the lycanthrope subjugation, Chris and Caitlin had been, naturally, absent and Shutra hadn&#x2019;t been present at the other times.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Silvan remained silent due to Chris while Caitlin, who wanted to get close to the other royal children, had a mixed look of worry and expectation on her face.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Chris grabbed Caitlin&#x2019;s hand and said,</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;As Mother said, you shouldn&#x2019;t worry about it. Maybe there is a problem on the periphery.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;The periphery?&quot;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Felicia was the one who asked. Chris nodded and continued speaking,</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;I heard some things on the way, but I&#x2019;ll have to check again today. It seems like the contents of the court gathering haven&#x2019;t been publicized to the palace yet.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Maybe it was an incident similar to the uprising of the Red Lightning tribe.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Due to the fact that the story hadn&#x2019;t spread in the castle, Chris judged it wasn&#x2019;t a big deal and changed the subject to something else.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;Rather...&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;Rather?&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;I am already looking forward to it. What else will happen at this court gathering? I was sad that I couldn&#x2019;t participate in Shutra&#x2019;s second court gathering.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">He wanted something extraordinary to happen so that everyone would be shocked.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">On the other hand, Felicia frowned and touched her chest.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;My heart isn&#x2019;t good. Please let this time go smoothly, Shutra. Yes?&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Silvan&#x2019;s and Caitlin&#x2019;s gazes also turned to In-gong. In-gong smiled in a manner similar to the gaze had given Amita when he had spoken about the smithy.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Two days later, it was the day of the court gathering.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">In-gong&#x2019;s faction was in the waiting room. Baikal and Zephyr were going to participate in the court gathering without waiting, while Victor and Anastasia were in a different room. Therefore, everybody was comfortable, except for Silvan.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Uhh, I&#x2019;ve worn this three times and I&#x2019;m still not used to it.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Carack spoke while touching his tie. Due to his hulking shoulders, Carack looked pretty good in a suit.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">In-gong glanced at the others. As always, Felicia was wearing a red dress cut so deep, he could glimpse her hip bone, while Silvan was wearing a black uniform decorated with gold thread. He couldn&#x2019;t wear his captain clothes and wasn&#x2019;t exposed like Felicia, but he was still wearing his eyepatch.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Caitlin was wearing a blue dress that emphasized her waist, making her look calm and cute.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">However, the most noticeable one was Chris. Although he had big muscles like Carack, Chris gave off a wild feeling in his black suit.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">In-gong wore the white suit that he had already worn twice to the court gatherings, but Felicia seemed very dissatisfied that he wore the same clothes three times in a row.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Anyhow, please let this proceed well without any fuss.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Felicia held her hands together and prayed while Chris chuckled.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Then the waiting room door opened. It was their turn to enter.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&amp;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">As soon as the door opened, In-gong sensed it.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Something was wrong.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">The court gathering was filled with silence. Confusion and surprise seemed to emerge even in the silence.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x2018;Why?&#x2019;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">In-gong looked in front of him. He could see the backs of 1st Prince Baikal, 2nd Prince Zephyr, 3rd Prince Victor and 4th Princess Anastasia who were kneeling on one knee before the demon king</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">It wasn&#x2019;t because of them. They were surprised as well.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Zephyr and Anastasia didn&#x2019;t reveal anything, but Baikal and Victor seemed somewhat uncomfortable.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x2018;Then what is it?&#x2019;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">In-gong&#x2019;s gaze moved a little further, then he heard Silvan&#x2019;s sound of shock from behind him. Felicia and Caitlin, as well as Chris who was expecting an extraordinary situation, couldn&#x2019;t conceal their shock either.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">At the highest place on the podium...</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">The demon king wasn&#x2019;t alone. There was one person next to the throne of the demon king:</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Sword Duke Ishgard.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">He was an elder of the sura who had never once shown up at the court gathering ceremony. With the exception of the demon king, he was someone who boasted the greatest strength in the Demon World!</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">His eyes moved toward In-gong, then his pleasant voice filled the silence.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;9th Prince, it has been one month. How are you?&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">It was a light greeting.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">However, it could never be taken lightly.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">All eyes turned to In-gong and there were suppressed moans in many places.</span></p><hr><p><br></p><p><br></p></div><p><br></p>
