Among the crew members, there were those who cried out in shock and admiration.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">The 9th Prince had jumped from the deck and the lake exploded.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Water droplets rose up high into the sky and glowed a beautiful red and yellow. As the large mass of water returned to where it was supposed to be, the body of the sea serpent smashed into the lake.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">One hit.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Most of the crew members hadn&#x2019;t witnessed the moment of attack, but they understood instinctively.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">It was a fight that had ended in one shot. 9th Prince had taken care of the sea serpent, known as the dragon of the sea, with one blow.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x2018;How on earth...?&#x2019;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">The crew swallowed their saliva and looked at each other. A few of them looked at Silvan, their captain, and the strongest one on the ship. However, Silvan wasn&#x2019;t much different and was also looking down with a lost expression.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Silvan had strengthened his eyesight with aura and was able to see In-gong through the remains of the sea serpent.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">In-gong was standing on White Eagle, not in the water.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">He waved to Silvan who waved back reflexively. Then Silvan glanced at Felicia and Caitlin standing next to him. It was a useless reasoning, but it seemed like In-gong wasn&#x2019;t waving to Silvan but to Felicia and Caitlin.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;How?&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Silvan asked Felicia with a large wave of his hand. He didn&#x2019;t know what else to say.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Felicia smiled widely at Silvan. She also seemed quite surprised by the attack as there was some confusion on her face.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">However, she wasn&#x2019;t like Silvan and the crew members. She opened her eyes wide and replied,</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;Didn&#x2019;t I tell you? Our Shutra is great. He can remove a sea snake in one shot.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">If Chris was there, he would have questioned it. However, the person here was not Chris but Caitlin.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;That&apos;s right, Shutra is amazing.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Caitlin nodded in agreement. The two of them boasted proudly.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Silvan felt dizzy and headed down to below the deck. He ordered the crew to lower the Black Flame Dragon.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&amp;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x2018;Master, are you okay?&#x2019;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Green Wind&#x2019;s worried voice was heard in In-gong&#x2019;s ears. In-gong then glanced at Earth Quaker and Ascalon in his right hand and nodded. It wasn&#x2019;t obvious from a distance, but In-gong&#x2019;s face was pale.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;I&#x2019;m fine. It&#x2019;s just that my arms are hurting.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">His arms would have been shattered if he hadn&#x2019;t reinforced them with aura. He had used an incredibly powerful attack, so the burden on his arms were enormous.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">In-gong stored Earth Quaker and Ascalon in the inventory. He looked up at the sky and saw the Black Flame Dragon descending slowly.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&apos;Master, I&#x2019;m sorry that White Eagle is so narrow. It might be difficult, but you should stay standing until the ship comes down.&#x2019;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;No, Green Wind did really well. It is thanks to Green Wind blowing the wind properly that I was able to hit it in one shot. Good job.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">In-gong said with a laugh and Green Wind appeared in a semi-solid form in the air. She looked down at White Eagle with a restless face, but it was cramped even with just In-gong on there. Two people might be able to stand if they stuck together, but In-gong could lose his balance and it would be difficult to achieve.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&apos;Uhh, I want to be stroked and praised, but I&#x2019;ll have to wait until we return to land. When we return, don&#x2019;t forget to give me praise. I&#x2019;ll save it for now.&#x2019;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Green Wind declared with a serious expression and In-gong laughed.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;Yes, yes.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Sadly for Green Wind, In-gong could only stroke her head moderately before looking at the sea serpent&#x2019;s body floating on the lake.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">The sea serpent was an enormous monster that was dozens of metres in length. It wasn&#x2019;t as smart as a dragon, but the sea serpent was clever enough to use a few psychic and magic powers instinctively.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">In Knight Saga, he had faced considerable trouble when dealing with the sea serpent.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Yet he had just taken care of the serpent in one shot.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&apos;Dragon&#x2019;s Bane.&#x2019;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">It was the name of Ascalon&#x2019;s super special built-in move.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x2018;Super Special Move Control&#x2019; was a skill that allowed him to use the super special moves built into each equipment.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Earth Quaker and White Eagle weren&#x2019;t the only ones among In-gong&#x2019;s equipment with a super special move. Ascalon, the best weapon in Thunderdoom Fortress, also had a super special move.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&apos;A super special move designed for big monsters and dragons... Indeed, as expected of Ascalon.&#x2019;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">As the name suggested, Dragon&#x2019;s Bane was a super special move designed to bring ruin to a dragon. As the appearance of Ascalon suggested, Dragon&#x2019;s Bane was a technique expressed through charging up the lance and was perfect for a one-hit attack.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x2018;I can&#x2019;t look back when charging the lance.&#x2019;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">It needed a courageous rush to pierce through the target. This was a technique that caused his blood to boil.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x2018;A combination with White Eagle?&#x2019;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">As he had White Eagle, he jumped at an altitude of 200 meters. At the same time as he fell, he boarded White Eagle and charged the lance while riding White Eagle like a surfboard.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x2018;I&#x2019;m glad that Green Wind can steer with the wind.&#x2019;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">She was able to properly control the course of White Eagle. Moreover, Green Wind controlled the wind as well. So, In-gong could just focus on the attack.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">In-gong exhaled. Thanks to Catilin&#x2019;s aura, he was able to suppress Ascalon to a certain extent. However, it still had an effect.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Dragon Blood consumed enormous amounts of aura and he used divine power as well, so he was exhausted. If he hadn&#x2019;t levelled up after killing the sea serpent, his legs would have probably lost their strength.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x2018;My only regret is the monstrous size.&#x2019;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Ascalon was too large to use against people. If the opponent was Gerard or the guardian, they could avoid the charging lance easily.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&apos;Well, there are some measures against people.&#x2019;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">He had Gigantic Piston, Arang, Earth Quaker and the super special move, True Destruction.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x2018;I am anticipating the third equipment.&#x2019;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">The elder dragon, Violent Kaltein...</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">What type of equipment would it be? What super special move would be embedded in it?</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;Shutra!&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Felicia&#x2019;s call came from near him. In-gong launched White Eagle toward the Black Flame Dragon that was resting on the surface of the lake.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&amp;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">It wasn&#x2019;t the applause of the soldiers, Felicia&#x2019;s admiration or Carack&#x2019;s easy praise that was waiting for In-gong on the deck.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;Shutra is too much.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Caitlin said with a serious face as she crossed her arms. Her tone was still cute, but In-gong made a serious expression.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;Sorry.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;I&#x2019;m not an aura supply for Shutra.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;I know. I&#x2019;m really sorry.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">He had taken her aura without seeking prior consent. Especially since this time, he had no excuses because he had simply wanted to see Caitlin&#x2019;s reaction.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">In-gong apologized again and Caitlin finally shrugged. She continued speaking with a big smile,</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;From now on, make sure you tell me in advance before taking my aura.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;So, it is okay to ask and then take it?&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;It is okay as long as you tell me in advance.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Caitlin&#x2019;s gentle voice and appearance was enough to call her a saint. However, In-gong didn&#x2019;t stop there.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;What if there is an emergency?&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Just like when they fought the guardian, there would be situations when they wouldn&#x2019;t be able to speak.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Caitlin frowned at In-gong&#x2019;s question.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;If there is an emergency, you can just take it.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;I understand, Noona. I&#x2019;ll do that.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Caitlin felt strange as In-gong laughed loudly. Seira tapped on Caitlin&#x2019;s shoulder and said gently,</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Princess is too soft on 9th Prince.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Yes, you play well together.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Felicia clicked her tongue and immediately switched the topic.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;By the way, you did a big thing. Even if you do have Ascalon, taking out a sea serpent in one shot... I was surprised. Aren&#x2019;t you much stronger than Silvan or Chris?&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">When In-gong rushed toward the sea serpent, it had been like a meteor falling down from the sky. The sight of the lake water rising up dozens of meters was spectacular but required tremendous physical power.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Silvan flinched at Felicia&#x2019;s direct comparison and spoke while touching his right eye,</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;Um, if I take this eyepatch off...&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">His voice was small and had no strength. Then In-gong spoke, comforting Silvan unknowingly.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;As Noona said, the sea serpent is a dragon. Moreover, the technique from Ascalon itself is very large... and strength isn&#x2019;t just about one hit, is it? I still have a long way to go to reach Silvan hyung&#x2019;s and Chris hyung&#x2019;s levels. Isn&#x2019;t that right, Silvan hyung?&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">His tone was calm and comforting.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Silvan hesitated for a moment before nodding.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Uhh, yes. Shutra is great.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Felicia laughed at the awkward compliment.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">At that moment, Carack interrupted the conversation and saved Silvan.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;By the way, what are we going to do with the body of the sea serpent? Should we take it to the raccoon as well?&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Among the dragons, the sea serpents were a fairly strong species.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Although sea serpents weren&#x2019;t as good as dragons, it was clear that both the scales and bones of sea serpents were advanced materials.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;It is great, but its large size... Silvan hyung, will it be possible to transport it using the Black Flame Dragon?&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Silvan&#x2019;s shoulders lifted up at In-gong&#x2019;s question and he replied in a voice filled with pride,</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;That isn&#x2019;t a problem. The output of the Black Flame Dragon is great. It is possible to carry far greater monsters than that.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;Then we should move it to dry land. Otherwise, various creatures will flock toward the body of the sea serpent.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Once a mighty beast died, the prey would gather for the meat.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Fish and other minor underwater creatures had already gathered there.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Felicia asked,</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Shouldn&#x2019;t we prepare for the caltos? We came here for that purpose.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Although they weren&#x2019;t as great as the sea serpent, the caltos were strong as well. Their entire bodies were made of solid metal, so they were difficult to deal with.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Uhh, I hope we don&#x2019;t feel the purple aura from the caltos.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Carack spoke in a small and anxious voice. In-gong turned toward Carack and said,</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Don&#x2019;t say those words.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;I really hope it doesn&#x2019;t happen.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Carack spoke with a serious expression and fortunately, his wish came true.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&amp;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Starting right now, I will explain the caltos strategy.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">As the Black Flame Dragon headed to the shore of the lake, In-gong started an impromptu lecture. His students were Felicia, Caitlin, Silvan and the other combatants.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;The caltos are made of metal, but their entire bodies aren&#x2019;t metal &#x2014; only the surfaces of their bodies are made of metal. Just like any other lifeform, their insides are made up of flesh and blood.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">The caltos were monsters with the bodies of lions and the heads of crocodiles. Their entire bodies were covered with green metal scales that edged close to black.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">In-gong picked up a knife and pointed at the drawing of a caltos that Delia had done.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;It is resistant to both physical and magic attacks, so the most effective way is to attack the insides. The caltos&#x2019; big mouth is its best weapon as well as its weakness.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;So, we attack when it opens its mouth?&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Felicia raised her hand and asked a question. In-gong nodded straight away.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Yes, the caltos have a habit of biting. We will take advantage of that.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Felicia&#x2019;s expression changed subtly at In-gong&#x2019;s answer because it was a difficult strategy.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">In-gong smiled at her reaction and continued explaining,</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;The next thing that works well is ice magic. The caltos are very weak in the cold, so their movements will become extremely slow. In other words, we will slow down their movements with ice magic and then aim for their mouths.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Felicia nodded as she finally understood the strategy.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Then that means I will play an active role.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">In the party, Felicia was the most capable one with regards to ice magic. However, at that moment, Silvan shook his head.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Hmm, this is an interesting strategy, but I have a more effective and efficient approach.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Silvan suddenly pulled out his sword and a dark aura flowed all around it. A blade of sharp aura molded around the sword.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">It was an aura blade that could cut anything.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Clearly, this was an area that Silvan was an expert in.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;My aura blade can cut through metal. Their hard shells won&#x2019;t interfere at all.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">It made a lot of sense.

I will cheer you on as you make these great actions.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">It was awkward and an obvious lie, but Silvan was convinced.

I believe in Oppa.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Okay, then I&#x2019;ll be going now. Caltos, be prepared!&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Silvan shouted loudly and jumped from the deck. With his cloak streaming behind him as he ran, it was a truly imposing scene.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Felicia gazed at Silvan for a moment before turning back to everyone else.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Now, we can have dinner and rest.
