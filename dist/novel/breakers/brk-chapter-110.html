Richard&#x2019;s hands were rough from holding a sword his entire life, and even among draconians, his hands were particularly big and hard.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">He wasn&#x2019;t alone. A few steps away from him was a young man called Henry, who was particularly prominent among the children of the five families.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Richard was a man with blonde hair that was reminiscent of a lion&#x2019;s mane, and a pair of long white horns stretched from his head. He had just been listening to Henry&#x2019;s report.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">He had known the answer since a few days ago, so this was just a procedural check.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;Do you know what you have to do?&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Richard asked Henry who was standing with a stiff expression. Henry hesitated for a moment then nodded.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Instead of blaming Henry, Richard just laughed.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">The instructions that Richard had given Henry a few days ago were simple.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x2018;Attack 9th Prince on his way to Evian.&#x2019;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">The people behind the attack wouldn&#x2019;t be soldiers from the Demon King&#x2019;s Palace or draconian warriors. It would be someone who had been kicked out from the Evian military and was already a wild dog.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">The aim wasn&#x2019;t to kill 9th Prince; Richard just wanted to learn more about him.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">9th Prince&#x2019;s appearance was too sudden. Therefore, Richard didn&#x2019;t know much about him.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">What type of person he was, how strong he was now and his fighting style...</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Richard wanted to know all these things. He had no thoughts about taking away 9th Prince&#x2019;s life.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">The demon king&#x2014;the sura king, Mitra didn&#x2019;t want that, and Richard didn&#x2019;t intend to go against the demon king&#x2019;s will.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">However, he couldn&#x2019;t help letting some words escape from his mouth.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;The demon king said that the strongest person should become the demon king. His thoughts haven&#x2019;t changed. But to not want a direct fight between the successors... This is a bit contradictory, isn&#x2019;t it?&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">His tone was moderate, but Henry could hear the growl of a lion in it.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">The strongest person would become the demon king.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Yet it wasn&#x2019;t acceptable for the siblings to harm each other while contesting for the position of demon king.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">It was a contradiction. How could there be no fighting when they were trying to determine the strongest?</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">There were the factions. Competition between factions existed, but it was all about spying and gaining information.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">The 4th Princess&#x2014;she had the blood of the serpent-like 2nd Queen Titania, so she used both females and males. No, she didn&#x2019;t fear any violence at all. She had drunk the tea given by the 1st Prince without any hesitation. The tea party was in a place widely known to everyone, not a secret location that no one else knew about.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Yet the 1st Prince had laughed and poured tea, and the 4th Princess had drunk it without any hesitation nor fear of poison.<br></span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">This was despite the fact that it was tea from the 1st Prince.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">They had lived for 20 years without suspicion of each other.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">However, could a real power truly be born in this type of environment? What did missions matter when they would return to a greenhouse that was the Demon King&#x2019;s Palace?</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Richard laughed once again.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;That face looks like you want to say something. So, tell me.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">With Richard&#x2019;s permission, Henry stood next to him. Although he wasn&#x2019;t a small child, the problem was that his loyalty to the demon king was too strong.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Unlike Richard&#x2019;s bright blonde, Henry had dark hair and blue eyes.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;When he was kicked out, he was at the level of the lower generals, but he is different now. His strength will be at the level of an intermediate general.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Yes, I know how strong he is. That way, I can also measure 9th Prince&#x2019;s strength.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Uncle... no, Captain. If 9th Prince dies...&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;6th Princess and 8th Princess is with him. So, dying won&#x2019;t be a problem. And even if one of them loses their lives... it is a matter that doesn&#x2019;t involve me. Moreover, we are being hit by the enemies on the periphery. 1st Prince and 2nd Prince have already experienced an encounter with the enemy. We have nothing to do with this.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Richard interrupted Henry&#x2019;s words and said it was inconsequential. He knocked against Henry&#x2019;s shoulder.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Henry, what are you afraid of? Such a thing will never happen. If I really intended to do that, then I would have used a much stronger person.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">This logic reassured Henry,but it was only for a second. In the end, the fact that someone strong was ambushing the 9th Prince didn&#x2019;t change.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Richard spoke in a calm tone,</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Maybe he will receive an injury that will make him give up his mission or doubts will start to form.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">It was only a matter of planting a few suspicious buds. However, that wasn&#x2019;t bad enough. He was going to change the current atmosphere, little by little.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;Tomorrow, we will return to the northern front. Be prepared to leave.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">At Richard&#x2019;s words, Henry departed the room with a stiff expression. Richard stared at his back and laughed.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;9th Prince.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Only a few months ago, he had been known as the Prince of Scraps, and now, he had created a new faction.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Richard didn&#x2019;t know how many skills the sword duke had taught him.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&apos;I can&#x2019;t possibly guess.&#x2019;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Would he notice that the ambush was instigated by someone?</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Even if he did, it would be impossible to find the person behind it.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">The mad dog was a draconian, but he was already a notorious enemy in the vicinity of Evian.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">This would lead to some doubts and a sense of crisis. Richard&#x2019;s purpose was to plant seeds of doubt, and that was enough.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">It would also be good if 9th Prince didn&#x2019;t notice at all. There would be no problem in achieving his desire to know 9th Prince&#x2019;s abilities.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x2018;I never thought it would begin with the 9th Prince.&#x2019;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Richard stopped touching the seal, and his gaze moved in the southwest direction where 9th Prince was.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&amp;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;Things are never easy.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Carack said with a bitter smile as he prepared to fight. The group of people running wildly towards them were enemies. They had to either run away or prepare to fight, but the former action was unreasonable.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">In-gong&#x2019;s eyes narrowed.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;I think you are right. I think it is because of me.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Huh? What does that mean?&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Instead of answering Carack, In-gong just laughed. He had seen a familiar face at the front of the rushing group.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Richard is doing this.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">In-gong muttered in a small voice. He was sure of it.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">It was an event that he had experienced many times in Knight Saga.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">In Knight Saga, Zephyr had gradually worsened the relationship between the demon king&#x2019;s children. He had made them suspicious until they thought they would be killed if they didn&#x2019;t strike first, ruining the relationship between siblings.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">This was one of the processes. The ambush at Evian&#x2014;rather than aim directly for the royal children&#x2019;s lives, it was an operation designed to disturb them and cause suspicions.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">The one behind this wasn&#x2019;t Zephyr but Richard.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">The royal child attacked was always different, but the person doing the ambush was the same.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Mad Dog Jiks.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">The soldier who had joined them as a guide agreed with In-gong.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;T-that&apos;s right. Mad Dog Jiks!&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Fear, confusion and doubts were all seen on his expression.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Mad Dog Jiks was notorious around Evian. However, his activities were far from here, so it was the first time the soldier had seen him. He was just able to tell due to Mad Dog Jiks&#x2019; unique characteristics.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;Shutra?&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Enemies had appeared in front, but it had been an unexpected ambush. So, she wondered how he knew.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;I was prepared.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;What?&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Felicia replied with a dumbfounded expression, but it was only for a moment. The fight was about to occur soon. Rather than continuing to ask questions, Felicia was convinced by Shutra&#x2019;s words.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">In-gong heard Green Wind&#x2019;s voice once again.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&apos;Master, it isn&#x2019;t just at the front. If I count all the enemies&#x2026;&#x2019;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Around 40? Most of them are cavalry?&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x2018;That&#x2019;s right. How did you know?&#x2019;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;Everything was dragged out.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Mad Dog Jiks was a real mad dog.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Although he had never been ambushed while playing as Zephyr, Richard had been his sponsor, so he had been able to learn more about the mad dog&#x2019;s abilities.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Among the intermediate generals, Mad Dog Jiks was average.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Before the Starlight Core, Caitlin wouldn&#x2019;t have been able to win against him. In fact, victory wasn&#x2019;t guaranteed even with the Starlight Core.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x2018;But what if it isn&#x2019;t Caitlin?&#x2019;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;Shutra.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;Huh?&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">In-gong turned around. Caitlin, who was prepared to fight while sitting on the black horse, was staring at In-gong.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;What are you thinking of right now?&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Did her wild intuition sense something?</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Instead of answering, In-gong smiled towards the front, and Caitlin&#x2019;s eyes narrowed.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">After fighting so many monsters in Spider Forest, the party remained relatively calm despite the 40 enemies. Only the guide soldier became speculative.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Prince, what do you want to do?&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Carack asked him. In-gong equipped Earth Quaker and White Eagle. After Amita&#x2019;s adjustments, Earth Quaker gave a low roar as it glowed red and yellow through the black scales.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">It was an ambush event, but he had no intention of losing. He would smash through Richard&#x2019;s intentions.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">In-gong nodded thoughtfully. Instead of answering, an angry white aura was activated.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&amp;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Mad Dog Jiks had left the army for almost 10 years now.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">However, he never forgot that the blood of a draconian flowed through his body.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">One of the elder draconians, Richard, had ordered him to attack the 9th Prince and learn his skills. It didn&#x2019;t matter if there were injuries, but he was ordered to not take their lives.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">However, Jiks wasn&#x2019;t displeased. He couldn&#x2019;t take their lives, but that didn&#x2019;t mean he couldn&#x2019;t do other things.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Besides 9th Prince, there was the 6th Princess and 8th Princess who were renowned for their beauty. Touching them would incite the retaliation of the dark elves and lycanthropes, but he didn&#x2019;t think that far. Why else did he have the nickname of mad dog?</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x2018;If I do this, I will need to flee from the Demon World.&#x2019;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Mad Dog Jiks&#x2019; logic was simple. The task assigned to him was to fight 9th Prince and report on his skills. Apart from that, he could do anything.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Instead of a horse, Jiks rode on a big wolf as he made some hand gestures. He had trained each member himself and was certain they would be elites if they were in the Demon King&#x2019;s Army.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">There were 40 of them, so it was clear that the 8th Princess would struggle.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x2018;I wish to taste her with my own hands.&#x2019;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">He had already forgotten about the fight with the 9th Prince. Jiks was just considering a confrontation with the 8th Princess.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">It was at that moment that...</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">The 9th Prince ran out alone. He wasn&#x2019;t riding a horse or even a draco.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Jiks laughed and whispered, &#x2018;I&#x2019;m not the only crazy one.&#x2019;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">However, it was only for a second. Jiks&#x2019; instincts screamed at him, and he used his aura reflexively, using the dragon authority that all draconians had inherited.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">This wasn&#x2019;t the time to relax. He pulled out his sword hurriedly. The reason for this was simple.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&apos;So fast!&apos;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">The dozens of meters between himself and 9th Prince felt meaningless. 9th Prince didn&#x2019;t stop and ran straight toward Jiks. In just a few seconds, he brutally trounced all the people in his path.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Two shields emitting a green light opened the way. His men couldn&#x2019;t even do anything as they fell to the ground with a moan. It happened so quickly that they couldn&#x2019;t perceive the fact that 9th Prince was among them.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">The next moment, 9th Prince was standing right in front of Jiks.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt"><em>Kwang!</em></span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">With a roar, the white aura exploded in the air. Jiks swung his sword reflexively to block the blow and felt a strong pain in his right arm. It was hard to hold the sword. Moreover, he couldn&#x2019;t keep his current position any longer.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Lightning struck in front of him. The moment it struck the wolf&#x2019;s head, blood poured from it. Jiks hurriedly threw himself backwards off the wolf, but the pair of black shield and white shield kept tracking Jiks. Jiks swung his sword to block the path of the shields. He succeeded in stopping the orbits of the shield but lost his sword in the process.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Jiks had bought some time. He needed the time to refine his aura management technique. It was only a few seconds, but he needed this time to calm his breathing and draw power.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">However, 9th Prince didn&#x2019;t allow it. He was overly quick and reached Jiks again.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Jiks grabbed a spare sword hurriedly and swung it roughly with his left hand through instinct. Of course, he was quick and strong due to his aura, but his opponent was also an aura user. So far, he hadn&#x2019;t managed to deal a fatal blow to 9th Prince.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Yet there was a sensation at his fingertips. His blow had struck the 9th Prince&#x2019;s chest.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x2018;How?&#x2019;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">He was amazed that he had gotten a blow in. However, Jiks wasn&#x2019;t a novice, and that was why he knew that he hadn&#x2019;t succeeded because he was lucky. It was because the opponent allowed it.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x2018;Why?&#x2019;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Moreover, why was 9th Prince smiling so happily in the midst of this painful situation. Surely, he wasn&#x2019;t enjoying this?</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">The reason didn&#x2019;t matter. Jiks used the time to try and pull out an extra sword. However, an invisible force crushed Jiks&#x2019; arm. There wasn&#x2019;t a gap that allowed him to fight.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;Thank you.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Jiks couldn&#x2019;t tell if those words were actually said or just seen through the eyes.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">9th Prince laughed as he made a fist, then something white and green exploded in front of him.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">The moment that Jiks was struck in the chest, the shock was greater than the pain.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">9th Prince&#x2019;s fist...</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">It was filled with the dragon power that was the aura characteristic of the draconians.</span></p><hr><p></p><p></p></div><p></p>
