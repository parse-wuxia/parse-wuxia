It wasn&#x2019;t hard to find her location because Felicia belonged to the King&#x2019;s Knights.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&apos;Too far away!&#x2019;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>If he used Wind Style, he could get there in a few minutes. However, he felt like a few minutes was still too long. What would he do if something happened in the meantime?&#xA0;</span><span>In-gong had already lost his temper when he heard Felicia scream. The image of Felicia protecting Silvan from the Famine Knight popped into his head, and he felt a surge of fear.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Prince!&#x201D;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>Carack shouted from behind him, in attempt to restrain him, but In-gong didn&#x2019;t care.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Felicia!&#x201D;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>It wasn&#x2019;t a simple call. This was the powerful Call of the King&#x2019;s Knights.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>He would normally have refrained from using it because he didn&#x2019;t know what Felicia was doing. However, now wasn&#x2019;t the time to consider such things. The moment he shouted the command, the space in front of him opened, and Felicia was revealed.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Shock Wave!&quot;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>Felicia cast a spell as she appeared in front of In-gong. It was because she had activated the magic the moment that Call was used.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Shutra?&#x201D;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>Felicia tried to stop the magic when she saw In-gong, but it was already too late. A powerful shock wave hit In-gong.&#xA0;</span><span>However, In-gong&#x2019;s body was able to withstand this level of magic. He didn&#x2019;t resist the moment the shock wave struck, but instead of being blown into the air, he used strength to flip and land on the ground.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>Normally, a shock wave would cause blood and vomiting, but In-gong was fine. Felicia&#x2019;s attempt to stop the shock wave at the last minute had weakened the magic, but In-gong&#x2019;s durability itself was very high.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;I&#x2019;m okay! Is Noona okay?&#x201D;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>In-gong asked loudly, and Felicia flinched with surprise before nodding. She looked around in a voice mixed with embarrassment.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Uh, yes. I see you used Call.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>Felicia was reminded of the fight at the 12th base of Curtis. Her breathing was probably rough due to her surprise.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Princess, what is going on? The fog is strange!&#x201D;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>Carack asked Felicia. No matter how familiar she was with Carack, she could not help but feel fear as the rough looking Carack approached. Felicia flinched again before shouting,&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&quot;I don&apos;t know. This is the first time this has happened!&#x201D;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>Felicia stayed at the Demon King&#x2019;s Palace more often than at the Dark Elves&#x2019; Palace, but she had still spent a third of her 20 years at the Sky Forest. This was a phenomenon which had never been present in the records.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Ku-pa-ha!&#x201D;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>Right then, In-gong used Dragon Words again. Due to the exposed side wall, the fog entered directly and banshees were forming. At that moment, Carack remembered something and took a step closer to Felicia.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Delia! What is Delia&#x2019;s situation right now?&#x201D;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>She was always with Felicia. Felicia had screamed, so maybe Delia was in a dangerous situation.&#xA0;</span><span>However, it was groundless. If there really was a dangerous situation, then Felicia would be the first one to return to Delia.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>Felicia replied calmly,</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;She will be fine. I wasn&#x2019;t in danger. I just screamed because I was confused. A banshee suddenly appeared in front of me. So, Delia will be fine. Yes, I bet on it.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>It seemed like Felicia was reassuring herself, rather than Carack.&#xA0;</span><span>Felicia explained the situation in a bit more detail. According to her, she had been walking along the corridor with Delia and two servants when she encountered a banshee.&#xA0;</span><span>After hearing about the growing number of banshees, In-gong spoke to Felicia and Carack,&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Then let&#x2019;s move on. First we need to secure the safety of Caitlin noona.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>After securing Felicia, the next one was Caitlin. Felicia was familiar with ghosts and spirits because she was a magician, but there was no telling how Caitlin would react to the banshees.&#xA0;</span><span>Caitlin was also a magician, but she could only use some spells for combat support.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>Felicia had a subtle expression on her face, but she quickly nodded. She was also concerned about Caitlin.&#xA0;</span><span>Caitlin&#x2019;s and Chris&apos;s rooms were somewhat distant from In-gong&#x2019;s room. If this were an ordinary mansion, the guest rooms would be close to each other, but this was the palace of the dark elves. Moreover, a distinction had been made between males and females, so the gap between rooms was quite substantial.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>They saw banshees in the hallway as the magic power of the fog became stronger. The sound of dark elves screaming, not banshees, could be heard in many places.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>In-gong gritted his teeth and used Wind Style. Carack and Felicia were together, so it wouldn&#x2019;t be a big problem to go first.&#xA0;</span><span>Like Felicia, Caitlin was a member of the King&#x2019;s Knights, so he had no trouble finding her room.&#xA0;</span><span>As soon as he arrived at the guest room, In-gong used the divine flame to break through the door.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Caitlin!&#x201D;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>The moment that In-gong shouted, several banshees exploded before him.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Shutra.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>Caitlin blinked with surprise and greeted In-gong. There was a considerable number of dead banshees in the room.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;This, </span><i><span>pant</span></i><span>, before, </span><i><span>pant</span></i><span>, guess, </span><i><span>pant</span></i><span>...&#x201D;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>Felicia breathed roughly as she arrived behind him. Caitlin didn&#x2019;t have blood covering her body like at the time of the Red Lightning tribe mission, but In-gong was reminded of that time. Even Seira standing beside her was unharmed.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&#x2018;Indeed.&#x2019;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>In-gong thought Caitlin was scared of ghosts, but that was a mistake. Rather, Caitlin&#x2019;s eyes were shining like lanterns.&#xA0;</span><span>It was at this moment that there was a deafening roar from behind them.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Ca-it-li-n!&#x201D;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>It was Chris. Felicia covered her ears reflexively with a frown while, In-gong grabbed Caitlin&#x2019;s hand.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Oppa!&#x201D;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>Chris sighed with relief as he scanned Caitlin up and down after arriving. However, shortly after that, he turned toward Felicia who was still breathing roughly and grabbed her.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Felicia noonim, what the hell is happening?&#x201D;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>It was a sharp voice, almost like he was interrogating her. Chris was terribly agitated. However, this wasn&#x2019;t simply due to the attack of the banshees. It was because the phenomenon that created the banshees was getting stronger.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&quot;I don&apos;t know! This is the first time!&#x201D;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>Felicia hit Chris&#x2019; hands several times before correcting her posture.&#xA0;</span><span>In-gong sandwiched himself between Chris and Felicia and said,&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&quot;We need to send people to Amita and Daphne.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>In-gong, Chris, and Caitlin were on the same floor, but Amita and Daphne were on a different floor.&#xA0;</span><span>However, Felicia shook her head.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;They will be fine. The two of them are sharing a room, and Daphne is good with spirits. Karma as well.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>There were two druids there, so it shouldn&#x2019;t be a problem. Additionally, Amita wasn&#x2019;t simply a raccoon who liked eating. They were a powerful magician and priest of the last flame, so they could deal with dozens of banshees at once.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>In-gong was convinced of this and nodded. Then Caitlin, who was still holding In-gong&#x2019;s hand, asked,&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Silvan oppa?&#x201D;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&quot;He won&#x2019;t have a problem. The important thing is to break this situation itself.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>Instead of Felicia, Chris replied. The power of life was a natural enemy to ghosts like the banshee. It was unlikely that Silvan, who was strong with aura, would be at risk.&#xA0;</span><span>3rd Queen Sylvia was the ruler of the dark elves and would likely have guards around here. Moreover, Sylvia was a powerful magician, so Felicia didn&#x2019;t need to worry.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>As a certain degree of comfort was restored, the agitation of the group subsided and reason was restored. However, they couldn&#x2019;t relax.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Master, the height of the fog keeps on increasing.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>Green Wind spoke in an uneasy voice as she looked far away. He hadn&#x2019;t noticed due to the excitement, but once he closed his eyes and concentrated, he could feel the density of magic power was becoming thicker and higher.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>What would happen if this situation continued?&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>Right now, only banshees were appearing. However, as the density of magic power increased, more powerful monsters might appear.&#xA0;</span><span>The banshees weren&#x2019;t a threat to the party. Even if stronger ghosts appeared, the situation wasn&#x2019;t likely to change. However, it wasn&#x2019;t the same for the ordinary dark elves in the palace. This situation could result in an enormous loss of life.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>Everybody looked at each other, but none of them could open their mouths.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>At that moment, In-gong opened his inventory and pulled out White Eagle. Just like before, an ominous light shone from Abseltus&#x2019; heart which was embedded in White Eagle.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Shutra?&#x201D;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>Chris asked hurriedly when he saw the modified White Eagle. In-gong replied as he stared at Abseltur&#x2019;s heart which was emitting a red light instead of the usual green light.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&quot;This is Abseltur&#x2019;s heart.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>The moment that In-gong said this, Felicia made a startled expression as she looked between In-gong and the heart.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Heok! Surely, this isn&#x2019;t because of Shutra?! Shutra is too much!&#x201D;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>Chris and Caitlin also seemed resentful. In-gong sighed at Felicia&#x2019;s words and explained,&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&quot;I&apos;m not the cause. Abseltur&#x2019;s heart is just reacting to the phenomenon.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&quot;It&#x2019;s reacting? Are you referring to Creature Abseltur?&#x201D;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>Chris asked quickly. In-gong was surprised.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;You know about him?&#x201D;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&quot;I only know that he dealt the dark elves a massive blow in the past. Beyond that, I don&#x2019;t know any more.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>Chris&#x2019; hobby was collecting stories of heroes and battles from various places. So, it was natural for him to hear the name.&#xA0;</span><span>In-gong gazed at Felicia, and she explained while fanning her face furiously with her hands, like she was trying to cool down.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Abseltur is a creature made by the first fairy king. He was a guardian when the fairy king was still alive but revealed his evil nature after the fairy king died. Anyway, if Abseltur&#x2019;s heart is responding, then that means...</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;It is clear that this incident has a connection to the first fairy king.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>Felicia nodded at In-gong&#x2019;s words. The name, Abseltur, was notorious, so she thought the cause of this incident was Abseltur&#x2019;s heart. However, that was irrational. It was more likely that Abseltur&#x2019;s heart was reacting to something, just like In-gong said.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Master, it is better to keep moving. The fog is starting to have a constant flow now. It will soon become a whirlwind.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>Green Wind spoke in a strained voice. He couldn&#x2019;t directly see the situation outside, but it seemed like the wind was becoming stronger.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>In-gong closed his eyes and focused on the flow of magic power. It was just as Green Wind said; a flow of gigantic fog was covering the whole Sky Forest, but it was still slow. As gandharvas were sensitive to all flow, it wasn&#x2019;t difficult to feel the movements. However, it was becoming faster. He didn&#x2019;t know how long it would continue to accelerate, but it seemed like a big disaster was soon about to happen.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Go underground.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>Felicia declared. She couldn&#x2019;t read the flow of magic, so she trusted In-gong and Green Wind. Instead of spending time on verification, the top priority was resolving the immediately situation.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&quot;The tomb of the kings is in the basement of the palace. The first fairy king&#x2019;s tomb is there, so we might be able to find a clue.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>The magic fog had been here before the first fairy king set up his kingdom. So, there was no guarantee that this phenomenon was linked to the fairy king.&#xA0;</span><span>However, Abseltur&#x2019;s heart was responding to something. Moreover, the tombs of the ancestors in the basement of the palace weren&#x2019;t simple tombs; powerful magic circles were engraved there.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>The tomb of the first fairy king was the starting point of all those magic circles. So, it was worth taking a look.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Let&#x2019;s go.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>Chris growled, and Caitlin nodded. The party, with Felicia in the lead, headed underground.&#xA0;</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p>
