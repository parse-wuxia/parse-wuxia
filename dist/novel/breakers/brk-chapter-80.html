However, it was also the same with In-gong&#x2019;s Arang. It was clunky compared to Gerard&#x2019;s, but it was still obviously an Arang.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">In-gong coughed up blood as his white aura exploded. Thick blood flowed along his jaw and there was no sensation in his right hand. Although he could still see, everything in front of him was blurry.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">In-gong didn&#x2019;t collapse. He twisted his upper body and watched Gerard closely. After being struck by the explosion, Gerard was raising his body with some difficulty.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Gerard was also a mess. He had released his Beast Form and his left arm seemed to have lost its function. The energy of Famine was also weak.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">However,</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#xA0;he was still alive. Gerard giggled strangely as he raised his upper body.&#xA0;</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Then&#xA0;</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">at that moment, a sharp dagger flew toward In-gong.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt"><em>Kakang!</em></span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">White Eagle blocked the dagger. The white metal spread out and blocked In-gong from Gerard&#x2019;s view. Blood was streaming into Gerard&#x2019;s ears, so he didn&#x2019;t hear anything, but he had a hunch.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">The moment that White Eagle flew back into the air, In-gong rushed toward Gerard. Instead of using aura again,&#xA0;</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">In-gong</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#xA0;shot a fire arrow at</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#xA0;his</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#xA0;right leg. Flames rose along the Dragon Scale Greaves</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x2019; scales</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Lightning.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Rather than a flash of whiteness, lightning poured down with the red flames. Gerard moved his body reflexively to avoid the attack, but it was unreasonable. In-gon</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">g</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#xA0;struck Gerard&#x2019;s left shoulder.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Rather than an&#xA0;</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">physical</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#xA0;hit, it was more like lightning had hit Gerard&#x2019;s left shoulder.&#xA0;</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">That</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#xA0;shoulder then turned into charcoal and crumbled.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Gerard flinched backwards. In-gong&#x2019;s knee was broken</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">, but he</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#xA0;rose again and yelled instead of starting another offensive.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;Carack!&#x201D;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;Kuraha!&#x201D;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Carack entered the fight that no one had dared to intervene. His huge battle axe slammed into Gerard. Gerard&#x2019;s chest shattered like his shoulder did and White Eagle struck&#xA0;</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">his</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#xA0;abdomen. Gerard&#x2019;s body was thrown back a few metres.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Carack grabbed In-gong&#x2019;s waist</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">. Then&#xA0;</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">In-gong leaned over Carack and looked at Gerard. However, it wasn&#x2019;t over yet.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Retreat!&#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">In-gong screamed in a cracked voice as Gerard&#x2019;s right hand slammed into the ground. He exploded his aura of Famine like it was his last hurrah.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Drain!&#x201D;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">The cry filled the surrounding area</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#xA0;and t</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">he power of Famine stretched out around Gerard.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Carack hugged In-gong and turned around. Green Wind generated a force field that&#xA0;</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">shielded</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#xA0;In-gong while the lycanthrope soldiers hurried to avoid Famine.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x2018;Master!&#x2019;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Green wind shrieked. The power of Famine collided with White Eagle and exploded. Th</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">e</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#xA0;land that&#xA0;</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">had been</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#xA0;swept by Famine was stained with a grey light and lost its beauty, appearing as a drought-ridden land.&#xA0;</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">The grass wa</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">s&#xA0;</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">withered</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#xA0;and g</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">iant trees became dry and fell down after not being able to endure their weight anymore.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">There were also victims among the lycanthrope soldiers. Those, who couldn&#x2019;t escape completely and had a part of their bodies touched by F</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">amine,&#xA0;</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">fell to the ground with a moan. Additionally,&#xA0;</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">t</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">here were those who lost an arm or a leg.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">A</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">fter the power of Famine disappeared,&#xA0;</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Gerard was gone</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">. He had obviously used the absorbed power to escape.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">[Your level has risen.]&#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">[Your level has risen.]&#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">The clear voice rang in his head.&#xA0;</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">This</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#xA0;was thanks to the battle ending after Gerard had lost his will to fight.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">A pure white light wound around In-gong. All the trauma, which ha</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">d</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#xA0;been&#xA0;</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">afflicted upon</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#xA0;In-gong&#x2019;s body</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">,</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#xA0;w</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">ere</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#xA0;healed.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">The lycanthrope commanders quickly understood the situation. They stared at Carack holding onto In-gong and shouted</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">,</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;Track him! Don&#x2019;t let him get away!&#x201D;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Follow! Don&#x2019;t approach him carelessly and use throwing weapons!&#x201D;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Even though they preferred close combat, it didn&#x2019;t mean the lycanthropes didn&#x2019;t use any weapons. Moreover, this wasn&#x2019;t an ordinary village but a military base. The lycanthrope warriors grabbed spears</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#xA0;hurriedly</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#xA0;and started to run in the direction that Gerard escaped to.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">In-gong wasn&#x2019;t able to look at them. He closed his eyes and panted for air.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">The level up effect healed the trauma, but the inside of his body was still a mess. The cause of the problem was that Arang had disrupted the circulation of his aura. It was hard to even breathe properly.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Prince, Prince. Breathe</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">, s</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">lowly</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">. T</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">ake slow and deep breaths.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Carack lay In-gong down care</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">fully</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#xA0;and started fidgeting. He wanted to do something, but the only thing he could do was wipe the blood from In-gong&#x2019;s mouth.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Chris&apos; voice was heard at that moment.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;This way</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">. C</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">ome on, hurry. Lay Caitlin down</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">,</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#xA0;next to him.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">As Chris leaned against one of his men, his voice was broken by a cough. He was in a terrible state, but ironically, he was the best out of the three who had fought directly against Gerard.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Gerard had r</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">u</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">n away</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">, but t</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">aking care of In-gong and Caitlin&#xA0;</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">who were before&#xA0;</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">him was more urgent than chasing after someone who had just stepped out of the Grey Tower.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">As he approached Carack, who was cuddling In-gong, Chris frowned like he was swallowing the pain and said</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">,</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Moonlight, extract.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">It was an incomplete order, but it was obvious what he meant. Caitlin&#x2019;s aide, Seira, quickly got up and ran to one place. Felicia cried out desperately</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">,</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Don&#x2019;t overdo it! You are also in a serious condition right now!&#x201D;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Felicia, who had been using her recovery magic on Caitlin, reached out to Chris. Chris stared at Felicia&#x2019;s face, which had become of mess of tears and a runny nose, and laughed.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;Noonim&#x2019;s face is also serious.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Chris!&quot;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;I&apos;m fine. Just</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">-</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#xA0;trauma. The problem</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">-</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#xA0;Shutra... Caitlin.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Seira came running back. She was holding a palm sized object in her hand.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Chris grabbed Felicia&#x2019;s hand and said</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">,</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Now this, most</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">-</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#xA0;magic power is strong... Noonim. So, I&#x2019;ll leave it to Noonim.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Felicia had no idea what the Moonlight Extract was</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">, b</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">ut based on the circumstances, she could roughly guess what it was.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Felicia nodded and Chris grimaced again from the pain. He smiled and continued speaking</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">,</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;As soon as the box is open, magic power</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">,</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#xA0;Moonlight Extract... wrap it. Wrap in magic power, divide in half... Shutra and Caitlin, feed.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;U-understood.&quot;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Chris released Felicia&#x2019;s hand. Felicia wiped Chris&#x2019; blood from her hands and took a deep breath. Tears were still flowing as she accepted the box from Seira.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">As a skilled magician, Felicia was also competent in dealing with herbs. It was obvious that the effect of the Moonlight Extract would be diminished if it was exposed to the air without being wrapped in magic power. It was likely that there was a special magic treatment for it.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Felicia covered the box with magic power and slowly opened the lid. Inside, there was a white herb that was a little longer than the index finger.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">It seemed to be a root. If In-gong saw it, he would have thought it was wild ginseng.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Felicia picked up the Moonlight Extract carefully as she swallowed her saliva. She hesitated before splitting the Moonlight Extract into two.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Then there was a problem.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;H-how do I feed this to them?&#x201D;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">The broken pieces of Moonlight Extract were quite hard. An unconscious person wouldn&#x2019;t be able to chew and swallow it.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Carack asked with an excited face</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">,</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Should you feed them with your mouth?&#x201D;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">He raised his hands to his mouth and&#xA0;</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">imitated a&#xA0;</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">chewing motion</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#xA0;of</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#xA0;an animal taking care of a young cub.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Chris slowly shook his head at Carack&#x2019;s question.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;No, mo-on. Moonlight Extract. Put in the mouth, will melt.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Felicia sighed with relief and turned toward Caitlin. Her trauma was recovered thanks to Felicia&#x2019;s recovery spells, but her insides were a mess. Felicia&#x2019;s eyes were filled with tears as she stared at Caitlin.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Chris spoke again</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">,</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Daph-ne. Druid, I heard. Noonim, help. Absorption...&#x201D;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Understood!&quot;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">For druids who lived in nature, knowing herbal medicine was a basic. Daphne&#x2019;s task with to use the power of the spirits to help the herb be absorbed.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Star-t.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Felicia nodded and pushed the piece of Moonlight Extract into Caitlin&#x2019;s mouth. As Chris said, the Moonlight Extract started to melt immediately. In an instant, it became a white liquid and was sucked into Caitlin&#x2019;s throat.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Daphne closed her eyes and started to chant the names of the spirits. Then, miraculously, a white light started to emerge from Caitlin&#x2019;s whole body.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;M-moonlight is coming from her body!&#x201D;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Carack shouted with surprise. At that moment, Green Wind appeared next to Carack. She spoke sharply with a hard face that was different than normal</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">,</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;The power holding the moonlight is melting. Hurry and give Master the Moonlight Extract. I will help Master absorb it.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">The lycanthropes were shocked by Green Wind&#x2019;s sudden appearance, but Felicia, who knew about Green Wind&#x2019;s existence, was different. She hurriedly pushed the piece of Moonlight Extract into In-gong&#x2019;s mouth.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">The beginning was exactly like it had happened with Caitlin</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">, b</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">ut it changed once Green Wind touched it.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">White light came out from In-gong&#x2019;s entire body. It wasn&#x2019;t a gentle glow like Caitlin&#x2019;s. The light was enough to fill their field of view as In-gong&#x2019;s body slightly floated up.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Carack glanced at Green Wind urgently, but she didn&#x2019;t have an answer. Her startled expression proved that this situation was unexpected.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;Ah, really! Why can&#x2019;t one thing be easy?&#x201D;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Carack exclaimed. Felicia asked Chris hurriedly,&#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;What is happening? Is something wrong?&#x201D;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Felicia was on the verge</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">-</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#xA0;no, she was already crying. Instead of answering straight away, Chris stared at In-gong. If the light from Caitlin&#x2019;s body was like the stars, In-gong&#x2019;s could be compared to the full moon.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">In-gong&#x2019;s body floated a little higher. Caitlin&#x2019;s body also rose like she was affected by In-gong. Green Wind and Daphne both reached out to the two people as they closed their eyes tightly and desperately called upon the power of the spirits.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">The Moonlight Extract was a flower that bloomed once in 100 years. In fact, this was the first time Chris had seen the process of someone eating the Moonlight Extract.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Caitlin&#x2019;s reaction was similar to&#xA0;</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">what had been written&#xA0;</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">in the general records</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">, b</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">ut it wasn&#x2019;t the same for In-gong. Moreover, Caitlin&#x2019;s reaction&#xA0;</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">was</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#xA0;changed now.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Like Felicia said, w</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">as there something wrong?&#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Maybe, but on the contrary...&#x201D;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;On the contrary?&quot;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Chris swallowed his saliva. He looked at the white light that couldn&#x2019;t be distinguished anymore and said</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">,</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;The legend of the Moonlight Extract, maybe this is it.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">An unusual record.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">The true legend of the Moonlight Extract that only remained in the records of the lycanthrope royal family.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Chris laughed bitterly. Carack&#x2019;s words were true.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Everywhere he goes, uncommon things happen.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Felicia looked back at In-gong. The warm light, that didn&#x2019;t hurt the eyes, pushed against the darkness.&#xA0;</span></p><hr><p><br></p></div><p><br></p>
