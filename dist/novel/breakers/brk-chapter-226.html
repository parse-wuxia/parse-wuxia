<p><span>Chapter 226 - Chapter 48 - Myth</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p><p><span>There were some things In-gong knew because he had conquered the white woman.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>The Four Riders of the Apocalypse were truly godlike beings.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>However, they were different from Erebos or Mother Earth. Erebos and Mother Earth were just beings who kept the balance of the world. They didn&#x2019;t have clear personalities. Although it was possible to interact with them, it was impossible to establish a dialogue or emotional exchange with them.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>Therefore, they didn&#x2019;t intervene despite the imminent destruction of the Demon World. They only gave strength to those who longed for power and desire.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>The elder dragons resembled the Four Riders of the Apocalypse. Like them, the elder dragons were gods with personality and flesh.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>1,000 years ago, all Four Riders of the Apocalypse had lost their bodies. So, they couldn&#x2019;t influence the world except through their knights.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>The elder dragons&#x2019; situation wasn&#x2019;t much better. No, it was worse. Half of the elder dragons had lost their flesh and the remaining three couldn&#x2019;t function properly. Cruel Talia still hadn&#x2019;t woken up from her healing sleep, while Enkidu and Queian had regained consciousness but not their strength.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>In-gong understood Conquest, and the white woman shared her feelings with him. She had her own unique personality and feelings.&#xA0;</span><span>Conquest refused the fate of destruction. Despite being born as one of the Four Riders of the Apocalypse, she longed for the world to be protected.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>Her wish was small and trivial, a flower which bloomed in the ruins of her mind.&#xA0;</span><span>It was small and beautiful, slender and pathetic. However, despite the harsh winds, it didn&#x2019;t give up on living.&#xA0;</span><span>The fluctuation was small, but her mind shook surely. Every time she took one step toward the end of the world, the shaking got bigger.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>The other riders also had feelings. Due to that, they still felt affection towards Conquest who had betrayed them. They both loved and hated her, and those sentiments were confusing.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>The elder dragons were similar. Recorder Torres gave his heart for Conquest. Watcher Ainkel sympathized with Conquest, and Guardian Queian didn&#x2019;t believe Conquest. There was doubt and hate.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>If so, what about the red dragon? Did he have a personality or was he just a monster?&#xA0;</span><span>Despite being banished from the world, he had maintained his existence for thousands of years. That tenacity was indeed amazing. His will to destroy the world was very solid.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>However, In-gong had made up his mind. He just didn&#x2019;t think about it.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&#x2018;I don&#x2019;t care.&#x2019;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>So what if he had personalities and feelings? The red dragon wanted to destroy the world, and the riders were just helping him.&#xA0;</span><span>If so, In-gong would stop it. It was the same as what the sword duke always said. He had to protect his precious things and smash the incoming enemies!</span></p><p><span>The will of Enkidu, passed on through Earth Quaker, laughed. Feelings of embarrassment were passed on from Guardian Queian through the Warrior&#x2019;s Sword.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&#x2018;My master.&#x2019;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>Conquest whispered. Green Wind whined, but it was only briefly.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>In-gong looked away. The red dragon stopped, and they stared at each other.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>The red dragon gave off a strong presence. In-gong was reborn as the true incarnation of Dhrtarastra, but he still couldn&#x2019;t reach that strength. The power of a god alone wasn&#x2019;t enough.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>He had dominated Conquest and become the true Conquest Knight, but it was still insufficient. The power of one who desired the end of the world wouldn&#x2019;t bring down the monster.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>The equipment of the elder dragons had unified. Although their bodies had been lost, their souls were passed on through the equipment. Ainkel&#x2019;s dragon heart had become one with the Moonlight Core, and he was now the true Drakon Kechatulla.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>However, it was still lacking. Despite all of this, In-gong couldn&#x2019;t narrow the small distance between him and the red dragon.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>The red dragon stared at In-gong. Thousands of black beasts and soldiers were fighting in combat, but at this moment, there seemed to only be the red dragon and In-gong.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&#x2018;Master.&#x2019;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>At this moment, Green Wind spoke in a voice like she wanted to help him. In-gong gave a small laugh. He was able to see it now. In-gong understood what the white woman and Green Wind were saying. So, he accepted it without any resistance.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>The light column of the Sanctuary started to emit a stronger light, and the red dragon widened his wings and roared like Earth Quaker.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>The last piece...&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>It was being transmitted from the Sanctuary. This was something that only he could inherit from the Sanctuary.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>The demon king didn&#x2019;t simply refer to the king of the Demon World. The demon king was the protector of the Sanctuary. Just like Erebos and Mother Earth, it was the person who maintained the strength of the Sanctuary itself.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>The Sanctuary, which had lost Mitra, wanted a new demon king.&#xA0;</span><span>They had opened the shield in order to accept In-gong.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>The red dragon unleashed his magic power. Once again, disaster struck the battlefield. However, it was too late. The succession had already begun.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>Time seemed to slow down, like it had frozen over. In-gong was reminded of the past.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>At first, he had just wanted to live. He&#x2019;d just thought about not wanting to be killed by Zephyr.&#xA0;</span><span>Then his thoughts changed. He wanted to protect Felicia and Caitlin, and prevent that disastrous future.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>In-gong continued to meet more people, then he wanted to protect Chris and Silvan as well. It was the same with Anastasia. He wished to protect all the children of the demon king.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>Then In-gong remembered Green Wind begging him to pat her head... Amita smiling happily with a big belly and Elaine&#x2019;s mischievous grin. There was also the sword duke&#x2019;s greetings with Felicia and Anastasia and Sylvia&#x2019;s gentle hug... Vandal chuckling next to the blushing Nayatra. Delia, Seira, Karma, and Daphne were also essential.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;I&#x2019;m sorry, are you leaving me out?&#x201D;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>Carack laughed in In-gong&#x2019;s imagination, and In-gong laughed as well.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>The light continued. The white light from the Sanctuary wrapped around In-gong. It became one with the power of Conquest and grew even more.&#xA0;</span><span>The red dragon used his magic power. Simultaneously, In-gong also exuded an enormous magic power with an angry cry.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>Everyone looked at In-gong, and it was accepted by all.&#xA0;</span><span>The strongest person in the Demon World...&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>Protector of the Demon World... </span><span>The demon king...&#xA0;</span><span>In-gong was the one who took over the throne from the sura king, Mitra!&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>The magics of the red dragon collided with In-gong in midair. The tremendous collision created a vicious magic vortex in the air.&#xA0;</span><span>However, this was just a skirmish. Each of the red dragon&#x2019;s seven heads had different powers.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>In-gong wasn&#x2019;t watching quietly, and the protagonist brought all his strength together.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>Felicia and Caitlin, who stood right beside In-gong, roared simultaneously. The two people awakened as apostles of Conquest.&#xA0;</span><span>Felicia, who was on the verge of exhaustion from faster than the wind, laughed. Meanwhile, Caitlin raised up the full strength of her wilderness and revealed a beautiful beast-like person.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>In fact, it wasn&#x2019;t just the two of them. Call had been used despite the fact that In-gong hadn&#x2019;t cried out a name. The King&#x2019;s Knights gathered through In-gong&#x2019;s power.&#xA0;</span><span>Nayatra looked around her with a surprised expression as a mighty magic power moved around her body. Her purple hair blew in the wind.&#xA0;</span><span>Vandal was also reborn as an apostle. He grew to a huge size reminiscent of a giant.&#xA0;</span><span>Karma, who had already experienced the apostle upgrade, dealt with her power skillfully, and many spirits gathered around her.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>Silvan stood beside Felicia. The power of Conquest allowed him complete control over the fairy.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&quot;My master.&quot;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Master!&#x201D;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>The white woman said in a sweet voice, while Green Wind, who had become the goddess of the wind, cried out competitively.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&quot;What a mess, a mess.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>Carack laughed before blowing the horn again. It was to spread news to the whole Demon World that a new demon king had ascended.&#xA0;</span><span>The black sky shook, and the white crack broke the red moon.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>Chris burst out laughing. It was right before the decisive battle, but he couldn&#x2019;t help wanting to laugh. He envied Caitlin, Felicia, and Silvan who were gathered in one place. He should&#x2019;ve closed his eyes and entered the King&#x2019;s Knights.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>Anastasia admitted it. It was curiously comforting. Maybe she had known that this was going to happen. No, she had definitely known. She had guessed it since the moment she&#x2019;d been saved by In-gong in Curtis.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>A smile appeared on her face. Anastasia had thought she would be upset, but she wasn&#x2019;t. Baikal orabeoni&#x2019;s words were right. They weren&apos;t enemies, they were competitors. However, In-gong was just more suitable to becoming the demon king.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>Then she remembered the words that Felicia and Caitlin always said.</span></p><p><span>&#x2018;Shutra.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&#x2018;Truly, Shutra.&#x2019;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>Zephyr closed his eyes, simply accepting it. He was a prince of the Demon World and out of reach of War&#x2019;s madness, Famine&#x2019;s greed, and Death&#x2019;s darkness. Zephyr was only responsible for his duties.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&#x2018;It&#x2019;s okay, Zephyr is still the coolest to me! And keep this a secret, but you are better than Erebos! Kyah! It will be okay! I&#x2019;m telling you!&#x2019;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>Altesia&#x2019;s voice was heard in his head. She used message magic on such useless words, but Zephyr couldn&#x2019;t help smiling.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>Warrior Locke grabbed another sword while listening to the sound of the horn in the sky. Guardian Queian had given him another powerful sword which contained the magic of a dragon. The true Drakon Kechatulla had returned, but Locke was still a warrior of the Human World. Beatrice prayed while Carlov tied his hair up.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>Seven pillars of light emerged from the red dragon&#x2019;s seven heads. At the same time, In-gong and everyone else started to move. Rather than fleeing from the fearsome power of destruction, they faced it head on.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>The sword duke wielded his sword. He cut through one pillar of light like he&#x2019;d done with the tsunami of undead. Silvan and Felicia held hands and used the magic power of the fairy to block one light column.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>Zephyr and Quanta blocked another pillar. Altesia and Beatrice used their miracles of light and darkness to crush one light pillar, while Locke roared and attacked another.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>Five pillars of light were thwarted. One of the remaining two were handled by the queens. Sylvia&#x2019;s and Titania&#x2019;s powers twisted the trajectory of the light pillar, while Elaine concentrated the auras of the Blood Companions and destroyed the light pillar.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>One pillar of light remained. In-gong rushed toward it as it extended straight to the Sanctuary. Caitlin followed In-gong. He moved through the air and aimed White Eagle at the giant pillar of light. Then Green Wind cried out with him!&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Absolute Area!&#x201D;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>It was White Eagle&#x2019;s super special move!&#xA0;</span><span>A brilliant green light collided with the column of light and split it into hundreds of branches. The trajectory was reflected, and the branches aimed for the red dragon instead.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>However, In-gong didn&#x2019;t stop. He reached for Caitlin&#x2019;s waist while casting another skill.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&#x2018;Black Specter.&#x2019;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>He triggered the super special move of Night Watch, Violent Kaltein&#x2019;s equipment.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>In-gong turned into blue smoke. There was the sound of hundreds of wings flapping as he rushed toward the red dragon.</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p>
