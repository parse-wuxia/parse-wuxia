<p><strong>Chapter 114 Chapter 18: Auction #6.</strong></p><p></p><div id="chapterContent" class="innerContent fr-view"><p></p><p></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Chapter 114 - Chapter 18: Auction #6</span></p><p></p><p></p><hr><p></p><p></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">There were other people who were surprised by the explosions and stood up. The staff of the auction house tried to calm people down, but it wasn&#x2019;t enough.</span></p><p></p><p></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Dear customers! Calm down&#x2014;&#x201D;</span></p><p></p><p></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">The head of an auction house employee, who was shouting loudly, was destroyed. A barbarian warrior had murdered the employee with a huge hammer-like fist. Someone screamed, and there was an explosion from the auction house. As the auction house shook, flames were spreading everywhere.</span></p><p></p><p></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">In mere seconds, the auction house had become a mess. People were rushing around in the middle of the explosion, and the indiscriminate killing committed by the barbarians added to the confusion. The security personnel around the auction house couldn&#x2019;t calm down the situation alone.</span></p><p></p><p></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Prince!&#x201D;</span></p><p></p><p></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Carack exclaimed hurriedly. Instead of responding to his call, In-gong opened the mini-map and searched it.</span></p><p></p><p></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">The explosion had first occurred outside. Maybe it wasn&#x2019;t just the auction house but all of Takar that was attacked. No, it was reasonable to think so. Otherwise, the current situation couldn&#x2019;t be explained.</span></p><p></p><p></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x2018;A small strike?&#x2019;</span></p><p></p><p></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">If a large number of barbarians had crossed the Eastern Limit Line, people would have already known about it already. It was obvious that they had to break up into small units in order to infiltrate the city.</span></p><p></p><p></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">In-gong saw that all the barbarian warriors were marked red on the mini-map. In-gong&#x2019;s allies were blue, while the auction house employees and general customers were grey.</span></p><p></p><p></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">In-gong&#x2019;s gaze turned toward the brightest red dot. Paratus, the younger brother of the barbarian king Karatus and probably the mastermind of this incident, was heading towards the stage with a ferocious smile on his face.</span></p><p></p><p></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">In-gong sensed it intuitively. The purpose of this incident was evidently the auction items.</span></p><p></p><p></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">However, what type of item would make him do such a bold thing?</span></p><p></p><p></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">The ruler of Takar and the owner of the auction house, Vulcanus, was a tough person. He was sure to retaliate in some way.</span></p><p></p><p></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">In-gong couldn&#x2019;t think about it for long. The situation was desperate, but it was also due to the new blue dot that appeared on the mini-map.</span></p><p></p><p></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">The blue dot had appeared far away from In-gong&#x2019;s party and was moving quickly towards the stage. In-gong shifted his gaze hurriedly. Apart from his group, there was only one person in Takar who would be recognized as In-gong&#x2019;s ally.</span></p><p></p><p></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x2018;Nayatra!&#x2019;</span></p><p></p><p></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Nayatra was dressed in a black china dress that revealed her thighs. He was drawn back into his memories for a moment but quickly snapped out of it. Nayatra appeared deeply confused by the current situation.</span></p><p></p><p></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Prince!&#x201D;</span></p><p></p><p></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Carack shouted again. In-gong delayed no longer. He opened his inventory and armed himself.</span></p><p></p><p></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">In-gong equipped White Eagle on his left arm and Earth Quaker on his right arm, while Night Watch was placed around his neck and shoulders.</span></p><p></p><p></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Earth Quaker had been tuned just before coming to the auction site, so it sparked with a red and yellow glow as it roared. In-gong glanced toward Caitlin.</span></p><p></p><p></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Noona, this is a request.&#x201D;</span></p><p></p><p></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Instead of asking what he was talking about, Caitlin wound up her long dress. After freeing both legs, a blue aura erupted around her like flames.</span></p><p></p><p></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Felicia asked in a confused voice,</span></p><p></p><p></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;Shutra?&#x201D;</span></p><p></p><p></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;The barbarians of the Eastern Limit Line!&#x201D;</span></p><p></p><p></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">In-gong shouted and ran towards the stage. He heard Felicia&#x2019;s voice again from behind him, but the urgent thing was Nayatra.</span></p><p></p><p></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">As always, time flowed equally as it seemed both fast and slow. Paratus, who had jumped on the stage while In-gong was arming himself, killed the auctioneer in one blow. He threw a scroll that caused a huge explosion and headed behind the stage.</span></p><p></p><p></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Nayatra moved towards the back of the stage as well. As expected, she was tracking Paratus from a distance.</span></p><p></p><p></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">In-gong jumped onto the stage and threw himself through the flames. At the back of the stage, the screams of the employees could be heard in succession.</span></p><p></p><p></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;Paratus!&#x201D;</span></p><p></p><p></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">In-gong didn&#x2019;t know about the situation inside, so he shouted loudly several times. As soon as he arrived at the place where the auction items were stored, Paratus turned toward In-gong.</span></p><p></p><p></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">As expected, the auction house employees were almost all dead. Paratus had grabbed the neck of an orc security officer and was about to kill him.</span></p><p></p><p></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Paratus glared at In-gong. Instead of paying attention to Paratus, In-gong looked at the mini-map and the area in front of him simultaneously. Nayatra could no longer be seen on the mini-map as she had gone into stealth. However, the pile of auction items couldn&#x2019;t escape In-gong&#x2019;s eyes.</span></p><p></p><p></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x2018;The Dragon King&#x2019;s Golden Helmet!&#x2019;</span></p><p></p><p></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">He was able to recognize it at a glance because it was special among the A rank items.</span></p><p></p><p></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">As the name suggested, it was a golden helmet carved in the form of a dragon&#x2019;s head.</span></p><p></p><p></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">The Dragon King&#x2019;s Golden Helmet was a symbol of King Taratos, the legendary barbarian king.</span></p><p></p><p></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">He could now understand why Paratus was so reckless.</span></p><p></p><p></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">For those who didn&#x2019;t know the history, it was just a good golden helmet. However, it was different for the barbarians. It was an item that could strengthen the legitimacy of the kingship and elicit absolute support from the tribes.</span></p><p></p><p></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Paratus squeezed his right hand and killed the orc security officer. Simultaenously, In-gong turned off the mini-map.</span></p><p></p><p></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;Green Wind!&#x201D;</span></p><p></p><p></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">White Eagle split into two and flew toward Paratus. While Paratus was surprised by White Eagle and Black Eagle that were emitting a green light, In-gong sprang forwad.</span></p><p></p><p></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt"><em>Kwang!</em></span></p><p></p><p></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">In an instant, In-gong narrowed down his distance toward Paratus and ran past him instead of attacking. Paratus panicked, but White Eagle and Black Eagle acted under Green Wind and blocked Paratus&#x2019; view.</span></p><p></p><p></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">In-gong arrived at the place where the auction items were piled up and reached out to the glass box containing the golden helmet. He had felt the anti-theft spell when he entered the auction house, but he ignored it. In-gong instantly conquered the spell and put the item in his inventory.</span></p><p></p><p></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Paratus ignored White Eagle and Black Eagle and sprang toward In-gong. However, Green Wind blocked Paratus once again. White Eagle and Black Eagle created a green barrier that blocked Paratus&#x2019; way.</span></p><p></p><p></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">In-gong didn&#x2019;t miss the gap created. He reached for the auction items piled up with the golden helmet. It was obvious that all the items would be destroyed when they fought here, and as expected, there were items he knew Nayatra was targeting.</span></p><p></p><p></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x2018;Nayatra&#x2019;s secondary occupation is a thief!&#x2019;</span></p><p></p><p></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Although she had been called Zephyr&#x2019;s knight, Nayatra&#x2019;s expertise wasn&#x2019;t fighting but in infiltration and information gathering.</span></p><p></p><p></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Due to this, In-gong had Nayatra perform more information gathering missions, instead of escort missions in Knight Saga.</span></p><p></p><p></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Additionally, Nayatra&#x2019;s ability as a thief shone every time.</span></p><p></p><p></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">He had used her skills in Knight Saga without thinking, but where had Nayatra learnt her thief skills? Was she an assassin and thief before she became a slave?</span></p><p></p><p></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">If had she appeared at the auction to steal one of the items, maybe she had been caught and turned into a slave.</span></p><p></p><p></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">It was just a guess, but everything fit.</span></p><p></p><p></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Then as if to prove In-gong&#x2019;s reasoning, he heard a swallowed moan. She was astonished to see the auction items disappearing as soon as In-gong&#x2019;s hands reached for them.</span></p><p></p><p></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;You bastard!&quot;</span></p><p></p><p></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x2018;Master!&#x2019;</span></p><p></p><p></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Paratus and Green Wind exclaimed. Instead of aiming for Paratus, In-gong triggered Night Watch&#x2019;s Blink and moved to Nayatra. Nayatra turned her head at the blue fog, but In-gong had already grabbed her arm.</span></p><p></p><p></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x2018;Master!&#x2019;</span></p><p></p><p></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Green Wind shouted again. It seemed like she had reached the limit of stopping Paratus.</span></p><p></p><p></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;Carack!&#x201D;</span></p><p></p><p></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">In-gong pulled Nayatra and used Call on Carack. Carack appeared with whirling eyes and In-gong said quickly,</span></p><p></p><p></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Take Nayatra and leave here!&#x201D;</span></p><p></p><p></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;W-wait a minute!&quot;</span></p><p></p><p></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Nayatra cried out in a confused voice. Carack grasped the situation immediately and looked up at the ceiling with a surprised expression.</span></p><p></p><p></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;Heok! Look at that!&#x201D;</span></p><p></p><p></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">It was a tense and desperate situation, so Nayatra and Paratus reflexively looked up at the ceiling.</span></p><p></p><p></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Just then, Carack moved. He hit the back of Nayatra&#x2019;s neck.</span></p><p></p><p></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;Keok?&#x201D;</span></p><p></p><p></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Nayatra leaned forward with a pained moan. It was a situation where he had failed to stun her with a blow, but Carack didn&#x2019;t care. Nayatra wasn&#x2019;t knocked out, but she was defenseless. Carack carried her onto his shoulders and started running.</span></p><p></p><p></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Both In-gong and Paratus were surprised by what happened in front of them, but it was only for a moment.</span></p><p></p><p></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Today was the first time Paratus had seen Nayatra. Although unfamiliar things were popping up in succession, this was irrelevant to Paratus. The only thing that mattered to Paratus right now was the Dragon King&#x2019;s Golden Helmet.</span></p><p></p><p></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">In-gong regained his spirit as well. The process was quite violent, but he was able to secure Nayatra. He would chat with her later.</span></p><p></p><p></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x2018;Master!&#x2019;</span></p><p></p><p></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Green Wind called to In-gong once again. Her call felt somewhat sad. This time, In-gong produced white aura and green magic power simultaneously.</span></p><p></p><p></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Paratus was in a frenzy because he couldn&#x2019;t get the golden helmet. Even if In-gong had come to defend Evian, he couldn&#x2019;t let the golden helmet pass into the hands of the barbarians.</span></p><p></p><p></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">White Eagle and Black Eagle, which had been desperately interfering with Paratus, returned to In-gong&#x2019;s side. Earth Quaker responded to the dragon style by growling angrily as the scales darkened.</span></p><p></p><p></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Paratus then triggered an explosive aura of vengefulness. In-gong felt the creepy roar of a lion, but he didn&#x2019;t turn his gaze. He formed a fist and activated Dragon Blood.</span></p><p></p><p></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Paratus, the brother of the barbarian king&#x2014;he was considered a strong warrior even among the barbarians.</span></p><p></p><p></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">In-gong took a deep breath.</span></p><p></p><p></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Then the battle began.</span></p><p></p><p></p><hr><p></p><p></p></div><p></p>
