No, did I really learn it?&#x2019;</p><p dir="ltr">&#xA0;Knight Saga had several powers.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">There were those who, like warriors, acquired aura power to fight directly with their bodies.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Magicians used the power of nature to cast magic.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Unlike theoretical magic, mental power and psychic power were close to instinctual.</p><p dir="ltr">The gods gave divine powers to their believers.</p><p dir="ltr">People were born with the powers but it was rare for someone to have psychic powers.</p><p dir="ltr">&#x2018;Did I wake up a psychic power? Then can I wake up another power like aura? If I have divine power, can I awaken it?&#x2019;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">If it was as he thought, then it was truly a scam. Even Zephyr and Locke couldn&#x2019;t master all four powers.</p><p dir="ltr">In-gong impulsively opened his skill window. Then he thought again because he didn&#x2019;t want to distribute his skill points too impulsively.</p><p dir="ltr">&apos;No, I have to. Right now, it will be a big help if I put points into Telekinesis. I must live!&#x2019;</p><p dir="ltr">He was currently in battle. This wasn&#x2019;t the time to save his points. He needed to leave here alive to learn other powers.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">In-gong cleared his thoughts and looked up. The exit was much larger than the passage because it was located in a vacant lot. However, the dozens of big orcs made it seem narrow.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Kuaaaak!&quot;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Kuhang!&#x201D;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Among them, Carack and Kaichin were facing each other. The other orcs wielded their weapons and were busy dealing with the enemies in front of them.</p><p dir="ltr">The orc that held a wolfbone staff and had hit In-gong with a psychic attack was fighting other orcs.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&apos;We are being pushed.&#x2019;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">The mini-map showed that each side had similar numbers.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">However, a fight wasn&#x2019;t just about numbers. In-gong nervously swallowed his saliva and stared at Carack. He was having a tough confrontation with Kaichin, a member the Red Lightning tribe.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&#x2018;Well done! As expected of Carack! It was worth giving that weapon to him!&apos;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Cough!&quot;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&#x201C;Keok!&#x201D;</p><p dir="ltr">Carack&#x2019;s orcs and the Red Lightning orcs screamed as they were killed. In-gong felt a sense of horror as he brandished his knife at a passerby and blood gushed out.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&#x201C;Pant pant.&#x201D;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">In-gong started breathing heavily. Due to the telekinesis strike, In-gong was now on the edge of the battle.</p><p dir="ltr">&#x2018;What should I do? Shouldn&#x2019;t I strike if I want some experience?&#x2019;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">It was unreasonable for In-gong to confront an orc. Although he was 1.3 times stronger than Villager A, an orc was many times stronger. Moreover, he had just learnt swordsmanship, so a 1:1 melee confrontation was too much.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">However, he couldn&#x2019;t just watch. He was able to gain experience just by wielding a wooden sword. Therefore, taking part in an actual battle could make his level rise in a flash.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&#x2018;I need to hold them off. How can I hold them off?&#x2019;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">He couldn&#x2019;t just lunge in and hit everything.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&apos;Something else, something different.&#x2019;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">It had to be helpful. It wasn&#x2019;t in his nature to run away or hide from a fight.</p><p dir="ltr">&apos;Should I increase the level of Telekinesis?&#x2019;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">If he invested all his skill points, he could increase Telekinesis to level three. However, it was hard to know how much each level would cost.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&#x2018;A lot of points are required for a skill like Telekinesis. It might require more points after reaching level two.&#x2019;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">He would be really upset if he didn&#x2019;t have enough to reach level three.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&#x2018;I can&#x2019;t just throw them all away on Telekinesis.&#x2019;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">There was also Basic Swordsmanship. If Basic Swordsmanship reached level four, it seemed possible.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">In-gong opened his skills window. However, unlike his original idea, he didn&#x2019;t touch Basic Swordsmanship.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">It was because he noticed something once again.</p><p dir="ltr">[Conquest Lv -]&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">An inactive skill.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Conquest Knight was listed in the uniqueness section.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">He had never seen a Conquest Knight in Knight Saga before. What was a Conquest Knight? Furthermore, there was also a skill.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&#x2018;Conquest.&#x2019;</p><p dir="ltr">His heart started throbbing. He had never felt this before. It felt like something was surging in his chest.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&apos;Punishment, obedience...governance.&#x2019;</p><p dir="ltr">These words popped into his head. At that moment, everything before him became dark and in the darkness, he saw a woman dressed in white. A woman with one red eye, one blue eye, long white hair and the adornment of a golden crown stared at In-gong.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Do something! Hit him!&#x201D;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">The orc holding a wolfbone staff shouted loudly and pointed at In-gong. All the orcs, regardless if they were friend or foe, stared at In-gong with surprise. A pure white light was surrounding In-gong.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&#x201C;Stop!&#x201D;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Hit him!&#x201D;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Watch the prince!&#x201D;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Carack was the last voice. Kaichin woke up from his amazement and aimed the hammer at Carack.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Prince?&#x201D;</p><p dir="ltr">This was the first time the prince didn&#x2019;t listen when he was called. Carack avoided the hammer desperately and Kaichin then started running toward In-gong.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Die! We must kill him!&#x201D;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">The son of the Demon King.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">A prince.</p><p dir="ltr">Shutra wasn&#x2019;t weak but Chris and Caitlin were incredibly strong. To Kaichin, who&#x2019;d dealt with both of them, Shutra seemed like a terrible monster.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Carack chased after Kaichin. The orcs with opposing purposes flocked toward each other; one side to protect In-gong and the other to kill him.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">In-gong didn&#x2019;t notice any of the fuss. He was alone in a new world where only the woman in white could be seen.</p><p dir="ltr">She said something but he couldn&#x2019;t hear her voice. Darkness enveloped the woman and the darkness covering In-gong&#x2019;s eyes soon faded away.</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Prince!&#x201D;</p><p dir="ltr">&#x201C;Heok?&#x201D;</p><p dir="ltr">Carack shouted and In-gong jumped back. Kaichin&#x2019;s battle hammer struck the place where In-gong had just been standing.</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Ohhhh!&quot;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Carack struck Kaichin. A struggle between the two orcs occurred in front of In-gong.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">In-gong quickly grabbed the dwarf dagger. Instead of leaping forward recklessly, his instincts made him open the skill window.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">[Secondary Occupation: Conquest Knight Lv1]&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">It was a new occupation. Additionally, it wasn&#x2019;t just the occupation that was added.</p><p dir="ltr">&#x2018;The power of conquest is a king&#x2019;s strength!&#x2019;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">In-gong understood it naturally. The skill Conquest had been activated.</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Below the King&#x2019;s Flag!&quot;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">In-gong stabbed the dagger into the ground. At that moment, a white light scattered around the area. A white line also formed between In-gong and Carack.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">It was only for a moment.</p><p dir="ltr">But it was enough. In-gong invoked the power of a king and Carack embraced that power as the king&#x2019;s subordinate.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&#x2018;Kuooooh!&#x2019;</p><p dir="ltr">Carack swung his axe. It was a faster and more powerful blow than before.</p><p dir="ltr">&#x201C;Keok?&#x201D;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Kaichin moaned with confusion as he was pushed back by Carack. Then Carack aimed his axe at Kaichin&#x2019;s head. It was a continuous strike that normally wouldn&#x2019;t have been possible.</p><p dir="ltr">The dwarf battle axe smashed through Kaichin&#x2019;s head at once. As brains and blood splattered everywhere, a sensation was shared between In-gong and Carack.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">[Your level has risen.]&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">[Your level has risen.]</p><p dir="ltr">Carack achieved some merits for his king.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">In-gong stared at Carack after gaining two levels. Yet, the line between In-gong and Carack was still the same.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&#x201C;Go! Carack!&#x201D;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">After hearing In-gong&#x2019;s command, Carack took a deep breath and pulled his axe from where it was stuck in Kaichin&#x2019;s head. Shaking his axe, he let out a battle cry.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&#x201C;Fight, fight! That is the only way to live!&#x201D;</p><p dir="ltr">The orc shaman, the orc with the wolfbone staff, shouted urgently. However, it was useless. The Red Lightning orcs standing near the exit were trembling as they felt like fleeing.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&#x201C;Kuooh!&#x201D;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Carack rushed through the orcs and swung his axe in every direction. The momentum was so intense that no orc could endure Carack&#x2019;s strikes.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&#x201C;Run away!&#x201D;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Once one of the orcs cried out, the balance collapsed completely.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">The Red Lightning orcs fled toward the exit. Meanwhile, Carack rushed toward the orc shaman who cursed and brandished his staff.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr"><em>Kakang!</em></p><p dir="ltr">There was a clanging sound as the axe and staff hit each other. However, they didn&#x2019;t bounce off each other. Carack&#x2019;s axe split through the staff and dug into the orc shaman&#x2019;s chest.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&#x201C;Kuhak!&#x201D;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">The orc shaman gave a pained groan. However, his eyes were still alive. He pushed intensely at Carack with Telekinesis.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">It was his final, desperate struggle.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">The orc shaman was determined to die. In-gong reached for his dagger.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&#x2018;Just one more!&#x2019;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">The orc shaman&#x2019;s next attack didn&#x2019;t happen. A new blade had pierced the side of the orc shaman.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&#x201C;Cough!&#x201D;</p><p dir="ltr">The orc shaman felt some excruciating pain while using Telekinesis. The orc shaman stared at In-gong who was stabbing him with poisonous eyes. The dwarf dagger was firmly embedded in him.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&#x2018;I have to kill him!&#x2019;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">In-gong didn&#x2019;t say it out loud but it was enough. The orc shaman fell down with a final cry and In-gong took a few steps back.</p><p dir="ltr">&#x201C;Hah, ha...&#x201D;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">The line connected to Carack disappeared. Despite having just levelled up, his body felt heavy like he had exhausted all his stamina.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&#x201C;Prince.&#x201D;</p><p dir="ltr">Carack called out to In-gong, who then turned and looked at him. Carack seemed like a brutal beast due to the blood covering him but Carack just laughed and raised his axe.</p><p dir="ltr">&#x201C;We won! I took Kaichin&#x2019;s head. Prince&#x2019;s victory!&#x201D;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Ohhh!&#x201D;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Ohhhhh!&#x201D;</p><p dir="ltr">Carack&#x2019;s orc subordinates cheered with pleasure at the victory.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Instead of cheering with them, In-gong sat down and breathed in deeply. Now that the battle was over, he didn&#x2019;t have much spirit remaining.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Over the orcs cheers, a voice was heard in In-gong&#x2019;s head.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">[Your level has risen.]</p><p dir="ltr">Level eight.</p><p dir="ltr">In-gong laughed with delight.</p><hr><p dir="ltr">End of Chapter 1 - Entry.
