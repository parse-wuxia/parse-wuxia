The original source of Famine was stronger still.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">In-gong could tell because he had faced the power directly. Gerard was still an incomplete knight</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#xA0;a</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">nd it was the same for In-gong as well.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Conquest and Famine.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">The source of power that the man with a spear had given off was Death.

What was the purpose of the knights? Why was the Death Knight aiming at Zephyr?&#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">It was almost certain that the Death Knight was an external force</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#xA0;as h</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">e was hostile to the Demon King&#x2019;s Palace.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">The Famine Knight, Gerard, was hostile to the lycanthropes.&#xA0;</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">A</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">dditionally, he didn&#x2019;t stop there. Famine itself had an enormous hostility toward Conquest.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Were Death and Famine on one side?&#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Why did Famine express hostility toward Conquest? It wasn&#x2019;t just because of In-gong&#x2019;s confrontation with Gerard. The enmity of Famine was rooted in something much deeper.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">The white woman</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">...</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">S</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">adness flashed in the red and blue eyes of Conquest. She reached out her hand slowly and</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">stroked the air like she was touching In-gong&#x2019;s cheek</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">despite not being able to reach him</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">. Then she</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#xA0;opened her mouth slowly</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">,</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Conquest Knight, my one and only hope.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">The white woman&#x2019;s voice was cut off like she had lost all strength after a few words. She gave another sad smile before melting into the darkness.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">In-gong closed his eyes. Like the white woman, he melted into the darkness.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&amp;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Gerard dragged himself across the ground. He had cut off his left arm that couldn&#x2019;t be used anymore,</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#xA0;but h</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">e couldn&#x2019;t suppress the pain.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">His remaining arm was touching the ground.

Gerard gritted his teeth and concentrated all his power&#xA0;</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">i</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">n his right hand. His aura circulation was a mess, so it took a lot of work to collect the power.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Gerard sat on the ground and panted. The soil was wet and cold but that helped relieve the pain.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Gerard counted down. He closed his eyes and focused on his hearing while gathering strength in his right arm.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt"><em>Kwang!</em></span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">The explosive power of Divine Beast Authority burst through his right arm. Gerard leapt up and hit the lycanthrope soldier who came close to him. The soldier swung his arm</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#xA0;reflexively</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#xA0;at Gerard, but it just passed through air. Gerard grabbed one of the soldier&#x2019;s arms, threw him down and grabbed his neck with one hand.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">The neck of the beast form lycanthrope was too large that it was hard to squeeze. However, Gerard used brute force and struck the soldier&#x2019;s neck with the palm of his hand. There was a terrible sound as the wolf lycanthrope soldier&#x2019;s neck&#xA0;</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">broke</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;Kukek!&#x201D;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">The lycanthrope solider lost his breath and tried to reach out</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">, but Ge</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">rard placed more force on the soldier&#x2019;s neck.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;Pant...&#xA0;</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">P</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">ant...&#x201D;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">The lycanthrope soldier collapsed and Gerard triggered the power of Famine. He gained a certain amount of strength back, but it was still lacking</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">,</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#xA0;like collecting water in a bucket with a hole.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;There!&quot;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Throw the spears!&#x201D;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">There was no room for his body to avoid&#xA0;</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">them</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">. The spears pierced Gerard and the dead lycanthrope soldier at the same time.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">It was hot. Despite being on the verge of death, the pain was vivid.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Throw!&quot;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Spears flew one after another</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#xA0;and</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#xA0;pierced his shoulders, waist, thighs and all over</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">his body. Even for the lycanthropes with their huge vitality, this level of injury would cause death.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">The lycanthrope soldiers didn&#x2019;t approach Gerard once. It would take more time to kill Gerard, but they were being careful.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Gerard laughed.&#xA0;</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">D</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">espite his lips cramping from the pain and injury</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">, it was definitely a laugh.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">He had spen</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">t</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#xA0;20 years in the deepest part of the Grey Tower.
