She closed her eyes to focus on the smell and her nose neared In-gong&#x2019;s shoulder.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Felicia, who was standing to the right of In-gong, laughed at Caitlin.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Caitlin, that nose... is it a dog&#x2019;s nose?&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">It was slightly rude, but Caitlin was a werewolf lycanthrope.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">In fact, lycanthropes generally had a good sense of smell.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">As Caitlin continued to smell him, Felicia also seemed to be interested and moved her face closer to In-gong&#x2019;s shoulder.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;Hrmm? It smells good. It&#x2019;s like a fruity smell. Is it a gandharva?&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">The gandharva were a species excellent in dancing and singing, so they smelled sweet generally. Just as Caitlin was a mixed werewolf, In-gong was also a mixed gandharva. So, it was natural for him to show the characteristics of a gandharva.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">In-gong made a strange expression and tried to maintain a steady posture as the two beautiful females continued to smell him.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Silvan looked at him with envy and poked Felicia&#x2019;s back.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Felicia, doesn&#x2019;t Oppa smell good as well?&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;It is too much. Sprinkle less perfume.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Felicia replied without looking back and Silvan crumbled. She then continued speaking without even moving her head,</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Caitlin seems to be correct? I feel like I smell something different than usual as well.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Her voice was filled with confidence. Just then, a new voice was heard from behind In-gong.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Didn&#x2019;t I erase it?&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">It was Green Wind. She took a solid form and rubbed against In-gong.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;Green Wind? Erase what?&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">After hearing Felicia&#x2019;s question, Caitlin stopped sniffing him as well and lifted her head.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">On the other hand, Carack interrupted them just as In-gong felt the mood turn strange again.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Wake up, Prince.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Carack laughed as he raised the fallen Silvan with his big hands.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;I am Prince&#x2019;s aide. I can&#x2019;t afford to let Prince look like that.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Carack glanced at In-gong who was situated between the two beauties and nodded.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">In-gong shouted loudly and organized the situation,</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Well, let&#x2019;s prepare to start heading towards Sun Lake now. As I said earlier, the first reason is to gather materials for Amita to use. The second reason, everybody should know it already?&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Green Wind stepped back upon In-gong&#x2019;s order and Caitlin and Felicia also increased the distance.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Fortunately, Felicia followed In-gong&#x2019;s change in topic.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;It is good. Weren&#x2019;t there materials in the archive room of Thunderdoom Fortress? In the first place, I had already reported that I was going to make a survey map of Sun Lake.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">She couldn&#x2019;t make a false report to the Demon King&#x2019;s Palace, so it was good that they would be able to solve the problem.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;The ruins under the lake... I am really looking forward to it.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Caitlin had a dreamy expression on her face.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Carack asked,</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;But what about Karma? She will come back with assistance in a few days. Is it okay to leave the response to the raccoon?&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Two people had gone to call for support. They had already contacted Robin with no problem using the telecommunication machine on Silvan&#x2019;s flying ship. However, Karma was already moving to Spider Forest with the rangers, so it was a problem.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">He knew her feet were very fast, but she had actually come back in three days. It seemed like she had worked very hard.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">They needed someone to stay behind and explain the situation to Karma and the lycanthrope rangers.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">It would be fortunate if Amita could fulfill that role, but like Carack said, there were some doubts.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;It is a little too much.&quot;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Felicia came to a conclusion and glanced at Silvan.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Silvan, can you leave a few crew members behind? We need to tell our party the situation as well as protect Spider Forest.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Hmm, the hardest thing to prevent is a sudden raid after everything is over. I will leave a squad behind with Sepira.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Silvan struck his chest with his fist and struck a pose after talking. Then Carack opened his mouth,</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Is Sepira the deputy captain? The woman with purple hair?&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Yes, she is Oppa&#x2019;s aide. By the way, you&#x2019;ve only seen her once and yet you remembered her?&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Seira&#x2019;s, Delia&#x2019;s and Daphne&#x2019;s eyes sharpened at Felicia&#x2019;s question.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Carack answered with an unconcerned look,</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Personnel identification is essential. It is important to remember any new faces. Doesn&#x2019;t it increase the risk if you don&#x2019;t know all the faces? Spies can mix in. It is better to remember faces than names.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">It seemed like he had remembered the faces and features of Silvan&#x2019;s crew members.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Silvan watched Carack with a bemused expression and asked Felicia,</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Felicia, is that really an orc?&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;I&#x2019;ve always wondered that. I want to investigate it just once.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">They didn&#x2019;t know if Felicia&#x2019;s words were a joke or a genuine answer, so Delia said with a smile,</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Carack is very competent. He has the sense of an aide.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;Really amazing.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Seira expressed herself in a manner similar to Caitlin. Daphne didn&#x2019;t stay still either.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Dependable. He&#x2019;s a really dependable guy.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Silvan gazed at Carack in a manner similar to when he looked at In-gong. Carack just laughed and scratched his head.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;I have to take responsibility as an aide.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Delia&#x2019;s, Seira&#x2019;s and Daphne&#x2019;s expressions became warmer. In-gong just laughed and Felicia summed up the situation again.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;The story has finished, so shall we start straight away? Silvan, please.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Silvan nodded immediately when Felicia asked him.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Leave it to Oppa.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">He left the small temple and gathered his crew. Felicia laughed as she watched Silvan and the crew move as fast as lightning.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Oppa is easy to handle.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">In-gong pretended to be deaf as he left the small temple with Carack. Silvan&#x2019;s flying ship, the Black Flame Dragon, was preparing its anchor for departure.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Then after 20 minutes...</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Black Flame Dragon ho! Start!&quot;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;Start!&quot;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;Start!&quot;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Silva drew his sword and shouted. All the crew members shouted along as well. The sails spread out widely while the magic power engine was activated and the flying ship started to move upwards.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Good wind! Fly with the wind, Black Flame Dragon ho!&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;Fly!&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;Fly!&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">The crew members blushed while Sepira and the squad on the ground felt like they were lucky.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;How shameful.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Felicia muttered as though she represented the hearts of all the crew members.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&amp;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">The Black Flame Dragon, the flagship of Silvan Doomblade, was one of the dark elves&#x2019; sacred ships.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Its original name was Black Ark.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">The dark elf society was centered on females, so a woman was to take over the family. In the Doomblade family, the best daughter inherited the clan while the best son was given the Black Ark. This had been going on for generations.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">The son of a son wasn&#x2019;t a member of the Doomblade family; this meant the family line was followed through the mother&#x2019;s line. So, the Black Ark was to return to the Doomblade family again.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Silvan had inherited the Black Ark from Lionel Doomblade, the older brother of 3rd Queen Sylvia Doomblade.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">In other words, it had been less than a year since Silvan had inherited the flying ship.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Just like with a novice driver, there were some problems during the flight but it was safe on the Black Flame Dragon. A trip that would have originally taken a few days took only a few hours.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">In-gong tied his waist with a safety strap and went to the railing. The altitude was at approximately 200 meters, so it was windy, but there were no problems looking out.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Sun Lake...</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">It was a place that In-gong had visited quite a few times in Knight Saga.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">The metal monsters Amita wanted them to catch were called caltos. They had natural waterproofing, so they could survive in the water despite their metal bodies.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Equipment made from the caltos&#x2019; metal was automatically waterproof, so it was indeed usable as a material if handled properly.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x2018;I caught a lot in Knight Saga.&#x2019;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Thanks to that, he remembered their weaknesses clearly. They were moderately strong, but In-gong was confident that he could deal with a few of them on his own.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x2018;Divine power.&#x2019;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">It was one of the four powers that existed in Knight Saga: Aura; psychic power; magic power; and divine power.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">At the same time, it was also the weakness of the caltos.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Thanks to the alliance with the last flame, In-gong had gained divine power.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&apos;Magic power and divine power are hard to use together.&#x2019;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">They didn&#x2019;t mix well.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Just like there were several gods in the Human World, the Demon World had several varieties of demonic gods.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Flora, who managed In-gong&#x2019;s mansion at the Demon King&#x2019;s Palace, was a devout follower of Camilla who was the goddess of dreams and shadows.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Nevertheless, the reason why Zephyr didn&#x2019;t use divine power was because it caused a dissonance with his magic power.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x2018;But I&#x2019;m different.&#x2019;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">In-gong glanced at the divine power in his right hand with interest. There was a gentle green light that reminded him of the last flame.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">In-gong added magic power to it. Just like aura, the white magic power started to mix with the green light.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Protagonist Body.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">It created a harmony between Enkidu and Ainkel&#x2019;s powers, which were exact opposites.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">What synergy effect would be caused if divine power and magic power were harmonized? If he mixed aura and magic power, there would be three combinations of aura, magic power and divine power.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">In-gong breathed deeply and turned his attention to somewhere else. A gigantic, golden lake glowed beneath the red and yellow sky.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">It glowed gold during both day and night, so it was called Sun Lake.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">The metal monsters were the only ones that they would meet at the lake.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">However, there was a monster called the gatekeeper of Sun Lake.&#xA0;</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">It was a type of boss monster.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x2018;It is about time for it to show up.&#x2019;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">As the lake glowed under the twilight sky, a head poked out of the lake.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Today was In-gong&#x2019;s day. He had always denied it, but today was different.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Would the attempt work?</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;Sea serpent? In the lake?&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">The crew member at the front gasped with astonishment while In-gong formed fists.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">The emergency bell rang in In-gong&#x2019;s ears as all the crew rushed to the deck in a combat stance.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Sea serpent?&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Silvan stared at the lake with a serious expression. The sea serpent was staring at the Black Flame Dragon like it was nervous.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">A sea serpent...</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">It was a sea dragon that lived in the sea.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">The length of the sea serpent was dozens of meters long and it was known as a powerful monster.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">The sea serpent was the guardian protecting the entrance to Sun Lake. It was a very strong monster and tricky for humans to deal with since its home ground was the lake.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">However, today was different.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Incarnation of Fire.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">He used a skill given by the last flame.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">At that moment, green flames appeared on the Dragon Scale Greaves. In-gong then equipped Earth Quaker and White Eagle and loosened the safety strap around his waist.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;Shutra?&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Silvan stared at In-gong while Felicia covered her face with a fan. Instead of being astonished like Silvan, she simply looked at In-gong with a relaxed expression.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Are you going?&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;I&#x2019;m going. We need to investigate under the lake.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">In-gong replied with a laugh while Silvan still seemed like he didn&#x2019;t know what was going on. Carack was grinning widely as In-gong stretched out his hand into the air.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Ascalon.&quot;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">A masterpiece of the Dragon Slayer series.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">It was the enemy of dragons and the weapon that had taken down the Black Dragon Partizan in Thunderdoom Fortress.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Earth Quaker and Ascalon were now combined. In-gong held the white lance and looked at Caitlin.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;Noona, sorry.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Caitlin tilted her head at his words and In-gong really felt apologetic.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">He didn&#x2019;t want to do it, but it was the easiest way to finish things in one shot. He had to mobilize everything he could.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Dragon Blood...</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">The power of a dragon humanoid.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Earth Quaker roared and In-gong&#x2019;s aura burst out like it had exploded. At the same time, Ascalon reacted to the dragon power and started to affect In-gong.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">He had barely endured it in Thunderdoom Fortress, but this time was different.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">He had the Moonlight Core and Starlight Core.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">In-gong squeezed out Caitlin&#x2019;s aura like he had done during the battle against the guardian. The power heading toward In-gong was cut off with the augmented aura.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Caitlin was startled by the sudden loss of aura, but it was only for a brief moment. Her lips twisted and she said quietly,</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;Shutra is too much.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Why did her voice sound so cute when it was filled with resentment? Moreover, Caitlin was smiling as she said it.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">In-gong concentrated the white and blue aura on Ascalon. The power of a dragon humanoid and the green divine flames came together as well.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">In-gong turned away from Silvan, who was still staring blankly, and climbed onto the railing.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;I will be going.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Go safely.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">The moment that Carack answered, In-gong jumped down. He charged the lance while falling toward the sea serpent.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&amp;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">[Title: &#x2018;Killed a Dragon in One Shot&#x2019; has been acquired.]</span></p><hr><p><br></p><p><br></p></div><p><br></p>
