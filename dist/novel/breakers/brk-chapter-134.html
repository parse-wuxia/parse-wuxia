<p><span>Chapter 134 - Chapter 23: Cross #4</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p><p><span>Evian&apos;s winter wasn&#x2019;t far away. Due to the influence of the limit line, the closer to the east it was, the colder the air would be.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>The fourth base was a mess.&#xA0;</span><span>The barbarians hadn&#x2019;t repaired the fourth base after occupying it because they hadn&#x2019;t intended on staying for long. The walls were collapsed, and the smashed gate was literally on the ground.&#xA0;</span><span>The moment the fourth base had been taken, the supplies warehouse had been burnt by the leader, so it was full of ashes. Nothing else could be found.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>It would have been great to see snow. There were no clouds in the sky, and the blowing wind was as cold and sharp as an ice blade.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>In-gong and Vandal left the base. There were many people who wanted to see the fight between the two, however, it wasn&#x2019;t meant to be a spectacle in the first place. Moreover, the struggle could destroy the already shattered base. It was no exaggeration to say the strength of an advanced general was a moving disaster.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>The soldiers climbed up onto the walls and watched from a distance. Only the 9th Prince&#x2019;s aide and the party of the princesses were allowed to accompany In-gong and Vandal.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>In-gong and Vandal stood facing each other in the wilderness. Evian was a wilderness, so it wasn&#x2019;t necessary to choose a battlefield.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>Felicia, who had been anxious on the walk here, was at a loss. It was because General Vandal was fully armed, like this was a battle.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Excuse me, General Vandal. Is this really necessary?&#x201D;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>Felicia asked in a strident voice as she looked nervously at Vandal, who seemed bigger than normal. Her eyes were shaken.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>Vandal liked Felicia. She was an upright person, so he wasn&#x2019;t going to lie to give her comfort.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&quot;I have to do my best.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>Vandal said softly as he stared in front of him. 20 meters away, Caitlin was standing beside In-gong with an anxious expression akin Felicia&#x2019;s.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Do you really not need my help?&#x201D;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>She didn&#x2019;t mean for them to fight together. Caitlin was asking him to take advantage of the penta-core.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>In-gong shook his head. The penta-core was certainly a great force, but it couldn&#x2019;t be established without Caitlin&#x2019;s help. It didn&#x2019;t fit in a fight against Vandal.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&quot;It&apos;s okay, this is a confrontation between Vandal and me.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>It was a confrontation between only two people. If he was the In-gong who had encountered the orcs in the dwarf cave, he would have avoided the fight, rather than fight alone. When did he become so brave?&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&#x2018;It is because I have to become the demon king.&#x2019;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>He needed to become a person suitable for that position.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>In-gong smiled as he thought about it. Then In-gong heard a voice, which was just as restless as Caitlin&#x2019;s, in his ears,&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&#x2018;Master, I can&#x2019;t understand it. I am Master&#x2019;s.&#x2019;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>White Eagle and Black Eagle wouldn&#x2019;t be used. In-gong had Black Eagle removed, and only attached White Eagle lightly to his arm.&#xA0;</span><span>In-gong refused to have Green Wind&#x2019;s help. She wasn&#x2019;t a tool like Earth Quaker or Night Watch, and In-gong wanted to fight by himself.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>Green Wind was grouchy from In-gong&#x2019;s attitude and joined Caitlin. In-gong appreciated the worries of the two people, so he couldn&#x2019;t help giving a small smile.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>Carack didn&#x2019;t mutter any words. He just stood far away and gazed at In-gong with calm and trusting eyes.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>Felicia moved back so that only In-gong and Vandal were left. Vandal grinned awkwardly as he held the handle of a large battle hammer.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&quot;I predicted you would be strong, but I didn&#x2019;t think it would happen within a few months.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>In-gong recalled their first meeting. At that time, In-gong had found it hard to deal with Villager A, let alone an orc.&#xA0;</span><span>However, it was different now. Everything had changed.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Isn&#x2019;t this good?&#x201D;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>In-gong mock shrugged, while Vandal laughed silently.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>In-gong&#x2019;s growth was abnormal. It was even a surprise for Felicia, even though she knew the facts such as the dragon heart and Moonlight Core.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>Vandal didn&#x2019;t know about such processes, but he didn&#x2019;t question it. He had already made up his mind.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&quot;On that day, I was ready to die. Then Prince appeared in front of me.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>Vandal had been caught by the pursuing barbarians. He had prepared for the end and dug deep into enemy territory.&#xA0;</span><span>Vandal was about to say something, then he shook his head. Instead of clumsy words, he said,&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&quot;I don&#x2019;t know if you are possessed by a ghost. Anyway, I am unfamiliar with expressing my feelings with long words. I am grateful for your time.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>Vandal raised his battle hammer. The steel-like muscles, revealed between the partial armour, swelled significantly.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>In-gong closed his eyes and refined his breathing. He formed fists and said lightly,&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Shall we start?&#x201D;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Let&#x2019;s get started.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>The next conversation would be with their fists.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>Vandal poured his battle cry into the sky. Instead of feeling fear, In-gong stood against the battle cry which seemed to rock the heavens and the earth. He released his breath and activated all the things he had prepared.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>The buff spells he had learnt from Green Wind, Felicia and Daphne wound around In-gong&#x2019;s body, and sacred green flames rose from the Dragon Scale Greaves.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>Then his aura hearts...&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>His aura revolved around the dragon heart and his two other hearts. The triple core swelled and produced a strong aura flow.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>However, that wasn&#x2019;t all.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>A dragon heart wasn&#x2019;t a heart with simple aura.&#xA0;</span><span>The dragon heart&#x2014;the symbol of a dragon&#x2014;could be called a dragon&#x2019;s essence.&#xA0;</span><span>Powerful magic power sprang from the dragon heart. Separate from aura, it shone green as Ainkel&#x2019;s symbol, and the dragon heart revolved aura and magic power.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>The effect was like a quad-core. Then one last thing was added, and the power of a dragon was pushed to the utmost limit.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&#x2018;Dragon Blood.&#x2019;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>Not just the dragon heart, but all three of In-gong&#x2019;s artifacts responded. Earth Quaker growled angrily while emitting a red and yellow glow.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>It was really a huge power. Faced with In-gong&#x2019;s fearsome momentum, Vandal just laughed wildly and lifted his battle hammer.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>Felicia&#x2019;s eyes closed tightly like she couldn&#x2019;t watch anymore, while Caitlin and Green Wind held hands.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>Carack just laughed. As In-gong and Vandal rushed at each other, Carack spoke in a quiet voice,&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Win.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>He didn&#x2019;t say anything more. Carack then formed a fist and gazed at In-gong. He remembered the moment when he had shouted, &#x2018;Faster than the wind!&#x2019;.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>Finally, In-gong and Vandal clashed, and the roar shook the heavens and the earth.</span></p><p><span>&amp;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>In-gong spread out on the ground. His flaccid limbs spread out like a squid, but he didn&#x2019;t feel like moving. No, it didn&#x2019;t make sense.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>In-gong was lying in a tent which was set up in the middle of the fourth base. Carack was sitting next to him.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&quot;So, why did you act so recklessly.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>Carack clicked his tongue and covered In-gong with a blanket. In-gong moaned and said,</span></p><p><span>&quot;Victory. I wanted to win.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>He hadn&#x2019;t expected to level up.&#xA0;</span><span>Although he defeated Vandal, it wasn&#x2019;t reflected properly in the experience.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>Carack clicked his tongue again. Even now, he could see In-gong&#x2019;s last reckless attack when he closed his eyes.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>Surprisingly, In-gong had allowed Vandal to strike him, and he hadn&#x2019;t avoided it. In order to counterattack, In-gong had taken the brunt of Vandal&#x2019;s attack.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>Even more surprisingly, he had managed to endure it. The magic shield and aura barrier he created had been shattered with a loud sound, but he had been able to withstand Vandal&#x2019;s left fist. Then In-gong had dealt the final blow on Vandal and won.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>In the dream the Lucid Dream Pillow created, In-gong had experienced 32 deaths, and In-gong learnt many things from those deaths.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>So far, In-gong had poured most of his additional points into strength. However, this time he spent a lot of points on durability as well as practicing a one-point aura defense.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>For In-gong, the thing he was lacking most in was defense.&#xA0;</span><span>He couldn&#x2019;t rely solely on Green Wind to steer White Eagle. He didn&#x2019;t forget that he had been driven to the brink of death by a single strike from the barbarian king.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>He would have invested in agility, but this wasn&#x2019;t a game. To In-gong, this was all reality.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>Vandal was a rather arduous opponent for In-gong. In order to win against such an opponent, he needed to gamble. In-gong strengthened his weakness and endured Vandal&#x2019;s hit instead of evading.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>The result was a great success.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>Moreover, it wasn&#x2019;t just his defense.&#xA0;</span><span>He had done it without activating the quad-core he shared with Caitlin. It was a true blend of aura and magic.&#xA0;</span><span>It was still incomplete, but he was sure the direction he was moving in wasn&#x2019;t wrong. It was in the distant future, but he would someday be able to add divine power and psychic power as well.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Your eyes are burning with ambition again.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>Carack laughed at In-gong.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&quot;It is that obvious?&#x201D;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;It is obvious. It is just burning.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>Carack said with a smirk before looking at In-gong&#x2019;s condition again. Thanks to Felicia using recovery magic while she cried, In-gong&#x2019;s injuries were already better. The problem was the excessive use of aura and the exhaustion of his spirit.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>It was at that moment that Carack got up suddenly. He looked at someone large who was approaching from a distance.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Prince, it is General Vandal.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>In-gong also saw Vandal in the mini-map. Dressed in leather pants, Vandal entered into In-gong&#x2019;s tent and sat down next to the entrance.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Prince.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&quot;You came.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>In-gong was lying down. Looking at their appearances, Vandal was the winner and In-gong was the loser.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>However, In-gong was the victor of the battle. Vandal touched his belly and said.</span></p><p><span>&quot;That was a nice blow. My stomach hurts even now.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&quot;My whole body is hurting.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>Vandal laughed at In-gong&#x2019;s words. Then he looked In-gong up and down and said,&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&quot;As Prince knows, I am an advanced general of the Demon King&#x2019;s Palace. It is a position that I can&#x2019;t just leave.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>The ten advanced generals of the Demon King&#x2019;s Palace were pillars which maintained the army. It wasn&#x2019;t a place that just anyone could rise to or simply quit after having attained it.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&quot;But if Prince ever calls, I will run to Prince.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>Vandal said in a gentle voice, before turning his head and coughing suddenly.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Really. I&#x2019;ve never spoken like this to anyone, even females.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>Carack refrained from laughing, while In-gong smiled calmly and waited for Vandal&#x2019;s next words.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>Vandal sighed and looked back at In-gong.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&quot;But I have to say it. I want to fight with Prince. I want to run behind Prince once more.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>It wasn&#x2019;t just because In-gong had won against Vandal. Vandal had already had the idea before today&#x2019;s spar.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&quot;On that day... I thought so when I saw Prince&#x2019;s back. I decided so.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>That day, he had been ready to die.&#xA0;</span><span>Then at that moment, he saw the back of a king.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;It is tricky. Will this be enough?&#x201D;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>Vandal turned his attention to In-gong, who understood Vandal&#x2019;s thoughts. In-gong forced his body upwards and said,</span></p><p><span>&quot;It is more than enough. Then, I will appoint you.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>Carack helped In-gong stand in front of Vandal, who naturally bowed to In-gong. Due to his size, Vandal was still eye-level with In-gong, but that didn&#x2019;t matter.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>In-gong stretched out his hands toward Vandal...&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>And Vandal was appointed as the fifth knight.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&amp;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>Zephyr raised his head and looked toward the south-east. He felt a pain in his heart, but it was just a short pain.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>There was a hellish scene before Zephyr. Hundreds of bodies were on the ground, and the bodies were all destroyed.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>Zephyr felt the movement of magic power. It was a magic which insulted the living and harassed the dead. Even shattered body parts were joined together again.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>All of it was flowing from the heart of one man on the ground. The man, whose legs had been cut off by Zephyr, was still breathing naturally.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>Necromancer Sektum...&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>The name was unknown, but Zephyr wasn&#x2019;t stupid enough to miss the jewel before him.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>Zephyr stood in front of Sektum, who had pale blonde hair and a pale face. Sektum&#x2019;s blue eyes were filled with horror and terror toward Zephyr.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>Zephyr stabbed a knife each in both of Sektum&#x2019;s shoulders. Then he forcefully inscribed the subordinate magic on the forehead of Sektum, who thrashed and moaned with pain.&#xA0;</span><span>It was a somewhat rough method, but it couldn&#x2019;t be helped since he had no time.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>After completely subduing Sektum, Zephyr looked toward the north. He could feel gazes looking at him from ridiculously far away.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>Death and War... &#xA0;</span></p><p><span>There were things which could not be expressed.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>Zephyr raised his sword and filled it with magic power. He blocked the eyes which were looking at him from a distance and lifted Sektum with telekinesis.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>Once again, he looked toward the south-east.&#xA0;</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p>
