However, In-gong had Hundred Poisons Resistance, so he confirmed it himself.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">After completing a rough check, In-gong opened the letter, on which there were words written in a beautiful font.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt"><em>My dear brother, Shutra Ignus,</em></span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt"><em>I don&#x2019;t know what is going on, but all of my siblings are gathered at the Demon King&#x2019;s Palace.</em></span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt"><em>Although we couldn&#x2019;t communicate properly at the court gathering, it was very nice to see everyone&#x2019;s faces.</em></span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt"><em>Shutra, as you know, all of us have the same mission this time. The departure will be in one week.</em></span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt"><em>This is an important mission that involves danger to the Demon World, but I think it is a great opportunity. After all, it is uncommon for all of us to gather at the Demon King&#x2019;s Palace.</em></span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt"><em>Before we leave on our missions in a week&#x2019;s time, I hope to have a meeting between siblings. Wouldn&#x2019;t it be nice to see each other&#x2019;s faces and have a good chat?</em></span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt"><em>Two days before departure, in the afternoon, I will hold a small tea party where all of our siblings are invited.</em></span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt"><em>I&#x2019;d like to invite you.</em></span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt"><em>-Baikal Ragnaros.&#x2019;</em></span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">The contents were simple and affectionate for a letter written by royalty, but the royalty of the Demon World was different from the human world.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">In-gong read it quickly and handed the letter over to the curious Chris and Felicia.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;Baikal orabeoni.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Felicia nodded and turned to ask Flora a question. She asked in a friendly tone,</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Flora, was there anything else?&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;I&#x2019;ve been told that in addition to 9th Prince, the same letter has been delivered to the mansions of the other princes and princesses.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">The letter was an invitation to all the children of the demon king. Chris smiled and said with narrowed eyes,</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;A tea party involving all the children of the demon king. This is the first time.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">In the first place, it was rare for all the children of the demon king to be gathered at the castle.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Caitlin, who wanted to get close to the other children of the demon king, thought the idea of a joint tea party was brilliant.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Felicia alternated looking between Chris and Caitlin and shrugged.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Like Baikal orabeoni said, a gathering like this is uncommon. Even if everyone is gathered, we will soon scatter. Anyway, isn&#x2019;t Baikal orabeoni very busy?&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Not only did Baikal take missions as the eldest son of the demon king, he was also on the forefront as a general.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">He spent most of the year on the frontlines, so he didn&#x2019;t stay at the Demon King&#x2019;s Palace.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">A joint tea party.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">All the children of the demon king gathered in one place.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">The expression in Chris&#x2019; eyes became complicated.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;I don&#x2019;t feel like it.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">As expected from Chris.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">It was rare for the lycanthrope siblings to attend official events, so it went without saying that the result would be the same for information gatherings such a tea parties.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&apos;Certainly, he didn&#x2019;t attend in Knight Saga either.&#x2019;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Although it was different this time, Baikal had held several joint tea parties in Knight Saga. The participants had been different every time and there were some who never participated.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Caitlin&#x2019;s expression became grumpy as she heard Chris&#x2019; murmur. Her eyes asked, &#x2018;Will we also be absent this time?&#x2019;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Chris pinched Caitlin&#x2019;s cheeks. He laughed and turned toward In-gong.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;However, this time, we won&#x2019;t be alone. I will follow everyone&#x2019;s will.&quot;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Caitlin&#x2019;s eyes widened. She turned towards In-gong and Felicia, and Felicia spoke with a mischievous expression.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;The purpose itself isn&#x2019;t bad. I don&#x2019;t think Baikal orabeoni will be orchestrating something bad. Though... it is a little uncomfortable meeting Zephyr orabeoni and Anastasia unni at this point.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">So, was she participating or not?</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Felicia felt Caitlin&#x2019;s nervousness and nodded with a loud laugh.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;I will participate.&quot;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;I will follow Felicia&#x2019;s will.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Silvan agreed. In-gong was the only one left.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;Shutra?&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Caitlin&apos;s voice was impatient. Instead of answering, In-gong raised his arm slowly with a very serious expression. Caitlin&#x2019;s expression showed &#x2018;restlessness&#x2019; while Felicia and Chris tried not to laugh.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">In-gong said with a smile,</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;I need to participate. There is no reason not to.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Caitlin&#x2019;s expression became brighter. It was like a flower was in full bloom.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;It is nice to have a good relationship between siblings.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;Sword Duke.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">The sword duke interrupted their conversation with a laugh and got up.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Prince, I will go back now. I will be sure to go out the front gate.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">The sword duke had visited the 9th Prince&#x2019;s mansion.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">The meaning of that one fact was quite large and it was impossible for the sword duke to not know the meaning of it.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Thank you for your consideration.&quot;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">In-gong shook hands with the sword duke.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;I don&#x2019;t know if I should be praised for that. Also, if possible, I&#x2019;d like to see you once again before you leave. I am curious about the progress of the Divine Sura Authority.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Okay, do check our achievements before we leave.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Silvan&#x2019;s eyes shone as he heard the conversation. His nervous face resembled Caitlin&#x2019;s, who was eager to participate in the tea party.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">However, Silvan could not get any words out. This was due to another person speaking.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;If you&#x2019;re leaving, go quickly. Why are you talking for so long?&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Amita slammed their tail against the ground angrily. The sword duke laughed and looked down at Amita.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;I&#x2019;m glad that you&#x2019;re so cute.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;What cuteness? I&#x2019;m not cute!&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Amita protested, but it wasn&#x2019;t very convincing.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">The sword duke didn&#x2019;t stay any longer.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;I&#x2019;m going.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">He said briefly and left. Flora hurriedly followed behind the sword duke.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Amita glanced after the sword duke, then looked up at In-gong.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;I&#x2019;m tired. 9th Prince, can you give me Earth Quaker and White Eagle now? I will work on it immediately.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Having Amita as his personal craftsman was something In-gong had never dreamt about until now. Amita&#x2019;s head would be full of the readjustment for the next week.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Felicia quickly interrupted.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Amita, what about Silvan&#x2019;s sword?&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Don&apos;t pressure me, no pressure.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Amita looked up at In-gong and he nodded, pulling out White Eagle and Earth Quaker from his inventory.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Thank you, Amita.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#xA0;&#x201C;Yes.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Chris, Caitlin and Felicia knew about the inventory, so they didn&#x2019;t react&#x2026; but Silvan was surprised by the sudden appearance of White Eagle and Earth Quaker.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">However, no one explained it to Silvan, and Amita wasn&#x2019;t curious.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Amita used their ability to float White Eagle and Earth Quaker in the air, then looked at Daphne.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Daphne, I&#x2019;ll finish the embroidery in the workshop.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;Yes, Amita.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Daphne picked up the embroidery and left the room with Amita. Now, only the royal children and their aides remained in the room.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Felicia sank back onto a soft chair and said,</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;I would like to rest, but I think we should talk about the schedule.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">They would leave the Demon King&#x2019;s Palace in one week. There were many things to do in the meantime.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Baikal orabeoni&#x2019;s tea party is a tea party, but there is also another meeting. It&#x2019;s a meeting with the concubine children who follow Chris and me. Additionally, we should invite any concubine children who want to join our faction.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Now that they had created a faction, it was time to fill it up.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Chris spoke as well,</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;It is a little difficult to meet the nobles because there isn&#x2019;t much time left. Still, it will be good to meet the dark elves.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Due to 4th Queen Elaine, the lycanthropes gave their support, but the dark elves were still on the fence. Although Felicia and Silvan supported In-gong, compared to the lycanthropes, their support was uncertain.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">He had met the 4th Queen, Elaine. So, sooner or later he would need to meet with the 3rd Queen.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">In-gong recalled the Demon King&#x2019;s Palace before shrugging.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;Let&#x2019;s just have a large scale social gathering.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">In Knight Saga, meetings like these were coordinated by the butler and escort knight, Nayatra. This time, he would entrust the work to experts and not bother with the matter seeing as he had Chris and Felicia.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Felicia narrowed her eyes and said,</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Let&#x2019;s invite the concubine children the day after Baikal orabeoni&#x2019;s tea party. There will be rumours about the invitation, so they will try to gather information about we are doing and question us.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Chris nodded in agreement.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Carack represented the others in the group as he asked,</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;Uh... Princess, isn&#x2019;t it just a tea party?&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Why did things like &#x2018;gather information&#x2019; and &#x2018;question&#x2019; suddenly come out?</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Felicia sighed and said with a bitter expression,</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;On the surface, yes. Inwardly, it is different.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">It wouldn&#x2019;t be easy. They didn&#x2019;t know about Baikal, but Zephyr and Anastasia would be present. In particular, Anastasia alone was a problem.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Caitlin&#x2019;s face became depressed at Felicia&#x2019;s concern. It was far from the friendly gathering that she had been expecting.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Chris saw Caitlin&#x2019;s expression and changed the topic.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;By the way Shutra, why did you pick Evian? Is it because of General Vandal?&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Felicia was also curious about this. If they looked at it objectively, Evian was the worst choice.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">In-gong replied lightly,</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;That&#x2019;s correct. We met during the Red Lightning tribe mission. I wanted to meet someone who I knew and missed. I also want to strengthen ties with General Vandal.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">He didn&#x2019;t say that he wanted to take Vandal as a subordinate after a head-to-head showdown.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">However, Chris nodded when he heard &#x2018;strengthen ties&#x2019;.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;General Vandal... he is obviously outstanding. It would be nice to increase your standing with other generals, but strengthening ties to Vandal is a good choice. I am convinced.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Chris had decided to support In-gong, but he wouldn&#x2019;t do it without thinking. He needed a reason for In-gong&#x2019;s actions.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Though, isn&#x2019;t there another reason?&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Carack said, scratching his chin. It seemed like he had spoken without thinking.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Perhaps due to Carack&#x2019;s influence, In-gong also answered without thinking.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;There is a place nearby that I would like to visit.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Where do you want to go?&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">The confused Felicia asked. In-gong recalled Nayatra and said,</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Um, do you know Takar&#x2019;s slave auction house... What&#x2019;s with all these faces?&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Felicia&#x2019;s eyes had narrowed while Silvan&#x2019;s eyes had widened, and Chris had simply burst out laughing.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Caitlin was the only one confused, and Chris started talking,</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Shutra, don&#x2019;t you know what the city of Takar and Takar&#x2019;s slave auction house is?&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Eung?&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">In-gong recalled the Takar slave auction house that he had seen in Knight Saga.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Takar, the city of entertainment and pleasure.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">It was the so-called red light district of the Demon World...</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">And the slave auction house was called Takar&#x2019;s flower. There were more skin colours there than any other place in the Demon World.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Hrrmm, I see. Shutra picked Evian due to Takar&#x2019;s slave auction house. There must be something you want to buy there.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Felicia&#x2019;s eyes were cold.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Ah, no. So...&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">In-gong tried to come up with an excuse, but there was nothing to say.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">He couldn&#x2019;t say that he wanted to go to the slave auction house to buy a slave, and not just any slave, but a succubus.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x2018;Ah, no. I&#x2019;m just trying to get my subordinate, Nayatra, back.&#x2019;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">As In-gong didn&#x2019;t say anything, Felicia&#x2019;s eyes became colder, while Silvan clicked his tongue. He knocked against In-gong&#x2019;s shoulder and said,</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Well, it is natural to be curious about such things. It is understandable.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Silvan winked as he spoke. Of course, he only had one eye, so it looked like he was just closing his eyes.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;Unni, what is Takar?&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Caitlin asked and Felicia whispered into Caitlin&#x2019;s ear. Caitlin&#x2019;s face turned red instantly.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;Shutra is too much.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">What was this?</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">As the women&#x2019;s eyes turned cold, Chris knocked against In-gong&#x2019;s shoulder like Silvan had done and left the room with the others. Now, only In-gong and Carack remained in the room.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">In-gong sighed deeply and Carack watched from beside him. He said with a warm smile,</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Prince, you are also a man.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">In-gong sighed again and Green Wind appeared out of nowhere to hug him.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&amp;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Early the next morning, In-gong visited the large library.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">However, it was as he had feared. His merit level was still low, so he could only visit the surface level of the big library.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">He searched through various books in the library all morning but couldn&#x2019;t find any traces of the Four Knights of the Apocalypse or the extinct species.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Fortunately, there were quite a lot of books about the elder dragons, so In-gong picked out several books that would be helpful.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x2018;I&#x2019;ll have to enter the depths to get more accurate information.&#x2019;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Unfortunately, it seemed necessary to wait.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">In-gong spent time in the library reading books about the elder dragon, then went to practice with Caitlin. He almost visited Amita&#x2019;s workshop several times but couldn&#x2019;t see anything properly since Amita wasn&#x2019;t finished.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">So after four days, it was two days before their departure.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">The day of Baikal&#x2019;s tea party.</span></p><hr><p></p><p></p></div><p></p>
