<p><span>Chapter 231 - Epilogue #2</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p><p><span>&#x201C;The coronation is soon.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span>&#x201C;The wedding will be soon.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Silvan and Chris stood side by side in the temporary Demon King&#x2019;s Palace. Normally, they would be awkward standing together, but today was a bit different. The two people stood with comfortable expressions. </span></p><p><span>&#x201C;How surprising.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;What?&#x201D; Silvan asked. </span></p><p><span>Then Chris shrugged and spoke with playful eyes, &#x201C;I thought you would be crying due to Felicia ignoring you.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Silvan was truly an idiot when it came to his sister. Rather than getting angry, Silvan just laughed and responded in a similar manner. </span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Don&apos;t you feel the same way?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span>Chris also treasured his sister. No, Chris treated her more like his daughter than his little sister. He was truly overprotective. It was surprising that he had ever let her onto the battlefield.&#xA0;</span><span>It was an effective counterattack, but Chris just scoffed. </span></p><p><span>&#x201C;You might have forgotten, but I was the one to propose the marriage to Shutra.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Yes, you were the villain. Bad person.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Silvan and Chris laughed like idiots. It had been a long time since they could stand side by side and exchange jokes. </span><span>Then Chris took a deep breath. He looked at Silvan&#x2019;s golden eyes which weren&#x2019;t covered with an eyepatch and asked unconsciously, </span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Oh, can you control it now?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Somewhat,&#x201D; Silvan replied with a grin. </span></p><p><span>Chris nodded at the reply. &#x201C;Then it is okay.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>It had already been 10 years since the incident. Moreover, it hadn&#x2019;t been intentional. Chris hadn&#x2019;t wanted to admit it, but it hadn&#x2019;t been Silvan&#x2019;s fault.</span></p><p><span>As a child, Silvan&#x2019;s fairy had gone wild and almost killed Caitlin and Chris. It had been such a great shock that Silvan and Caitlin didn&#x2019;t remember what had happened, but Chris did. </span><span>It had been an accident. Fortunately, there had been no casualties, nor had it caused tension between 3rd Queen Sylvia and 4th Queen Elaine. However, Chris never forgave Silvan after that, until now. </span></p><p><span>When had this change of heart occurred? </span><span>Was it when Silvan showed he could control the fairy? Or when they became active in the same faction? </span></p><p><span>Chris recalled the dark elves&#x2019; Sky Forest. The image of Silvan rushing to save people by using the fairy came to mind. </span></p><p><span>&#x201C;By the way...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Silvan suddenly opened his mouth. Chris turned around and grinned. Silvan had the same expression he always showed Felicia. </span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Doesn&#x2019;t Felicia look fantastic as a bride?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span> There was no doubt about it. Chris frowned but soon smiled. He spoke with a strong tone,</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Caitlin is cuter.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span>Absolutely. </span><span>The two fools looked at each other and laughed. </span></p><p><span>&amp; </span></p><p><span>The reconstruction work was continuing at the Demon King&#x2019;s Palace. It had only been a few months since they&#x2019;d started construction, but the shape of the castle was already appearing thanks to the enormous number of people helping.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;It still seems like it will take a long time.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;It is because the Demon King&#x2019;s Palace is a large city. It will take a few years to restore its old appearance.&#x201D; Vandal, who was a newly appointed captain of the royal guards, was wearing flashy armour. He wanted to take it off all the time, but his position as a captain didn&#x2019;t allow him to do so.</span></p><p><span>Standing next to Vandal was the beautiful succubus, Nayatra. She wore neat clothing which signified she was part of the Demon King&#x2019;s Intelligence Agency, but she would soon form a new organization. </span></p><p><span>Vandal looked around the construction site and sighed again. </span></p><p><span>&#x201C;The coronation is in a month&#x2026; It seems like it would be better to celebrate it elsewhere.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span> The construction speed was fairly fast, but as Nayatra said, the Demon King&#x2019;s Palace was a big city. There wasn&#x2019;t much which could be done in a month. Perhaps the limit was the area around the Black Castle where the ceremony would be held. </span></p><p><span>Nayatra nodded in agreement, but her mouth turned slightly downwards. </span></p><p><span>&#x201C;It is because the palace is a symbol. Apart from the Sanctuary, this is the only place where we can have the ceremony.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span>&#x201C;It can&#x2019;t be helped.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Eventually, Vandal was convinced again. The palaces of the queens were luxurious and beautiful enough to celebrate the ceremonies, but they were too many queens. Picking one of their palaces would offend the others. Politics was a complicated thing. </span></p><p><span>Vandal shook his head to get rid of the complicated thoughts and turned to Nayatra. &#x201C;Is your work going well?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span> He was asking about a specific thing, and Nayatra understood. She replied with slightly pouted lips, </span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Well, there is progress. The queens are overcrowded, but it seems possible to be a concubine.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Unfortunately, her rivals were too powerful. Moreover, the position of queen wasn&#x2019;t something which could be achieved through love alone. She needed strong supporters, but Nayatra didn&#x2019;t have anyone. Additionally, according to information collected by Nayatra, it was undisputed that Anastasia would be crowned as 1st Queen. It was tradition for other succubi to become the concubines. Originally, the concubines of the demon king were the species which lacked the resources to establish a queen.</span></p><p><span>Although it was a story without any romance, the queens and concubines were the definition of political maneuvering. Cases like the former demon king and the 3rd Queen, or In-gong, Caitlin and Felicia were rare cases. </span></p><p><span>Vandal gazed at Nayatra with a sorry expression and said,</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;It is sad.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;It is realistic.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Simply meeting the prince was enough of a miracle. </span><span>A charming smile appeared on Nayatra&#x2019;s face. </span></p><p><span>&#x201C;There is a high chance of winning. I already have a strong relationship with Prince&#x2014;no, the demon king.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span> Nayatra said with confidence.</span></p><p><span>In-gong&#x2019;s story was frankly unbelievable. It was difficult to understand about the concept of a game. </span></p><p><span>However, she had to believe it, and she was very satisfied with the things he&#x2019;d told her about herself. Those in the Demon King&#x2019;s Palace who knew the &#x2018;truth&#x2019; about In-gong could be counted on one hand. </span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Well, as long as you don&#x2019;t dislike it. I&apos;ll cheer you on.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Captain, thank you for the support.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Vandal burst out laughing at Nayatra&#x2019;s cool answer. It was a louder laugh than usual, so Nayatra grinned. </span></p><p><span>&#x201C;What is it?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;I feel like you are really familiar.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span> It was as if there was a chain of fate between them.</span></p><p><span>Nayatra laughed as she recalled In-gong&#x2019;s story and said coyly, </span></p><p><span>&#x201C;I do as well, but you know that I&#x2019;m not going to fall in love with you, right?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Don&apos;t worry. I am not Carack.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>He was an orc, but his wives weren&#x2019;t orcs. </span></p><p><span>&#x201C;That&apos;s right.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span> Nayatra once again agreed. It was pleasant to hear the sound of hammering as the sun set.</span></p><p><span>&amp; </span></p><p><span>Time passed quickly. After a month of vacation, Carack returned with his wives. In-gong felt reassured after seeing Carack&#x2019;s relaxed face.</span></p><p><span>Invitations were dispatched all over the Demon World for the coronation. Baikal, who was responsible for the restoration of the Aegis Gate, as well as Victor returned after nearly half a year in the west. </span></p><p><span>Victor, who had been alone during the events which determined the destiny of the Demon World, became a strange presence in the new kingdom, but nobody was concerned. </span></p><p><span>There was a lively atmosphere due to the marriage ceremonies which would occur one month after the coronation. The wedding would be held three times in a row, so there would be a festive atmosphere for a few months. </span></p><p><span>During the night before the coronation... </span></p><p><span>In-gong stood next to Zephyr on a dark terrace. </span></p><p><span>Among the people who led the three factions of the Demon King&#x2019;s Palace, Zephyr hadn&#x2019;t declared support for In-gong, but it was enough that he showed up today. This alone expressed his intentions.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Demon king&#x2026; No, it is enough if Abamama had already decided it.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Zephyr, who had been the most powerful prince until In-gong appeared, knew many things. He knew about the demon king handing over the Seed of Extreme Nothingness, Caitlin&#x2019;s birth secret, and even the fact that In-gong wasn&#x2019;t the real son of the demon king. </span></p><p><span>However, he hadn&#x2019;t said anything until this day. Zephyr had kept quiet. </span><span>It was due to the previous demon king. </span></p><p><span>Zephyr was a proud member of the Demon World&#x2019;s royal family. He had no desire to challenge his father&#x2019;s will. Moreover, he had one belief. </span></p><p><span>&#x201C;The demon king should be the strongest person in the Demon World. The demon king is the one who protects the Demon World.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>It was why Zephyr had returned. </span></p><p><span>In-gong quietly smiled at Zephyr&#x2019;s story. He tried to hold it back, but the corners of his mouth curled up.&#xA0;</span><span>Zephyr frowned at the sight. </span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Be vigilant. You need to maintain your position as the strongest.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>This was a warning that things might be different if Zephyr became stronger, but In-gong&#x2019;s smile stayed.&#xA0;</span><span>It wasn&#x2019;t because In-gong was confident that, as a descended god, he could beat Zephyr. </span></p><p><span>&#x2018;It is great.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span>In-gong was standing next to Zephyr. It was difficult to compare this Zephyr to the brutal killer who had caused the Day of Massacre in the game. </span><span>As In-gong continued to smile, Zephyr narrowed his eyes with a worried expression. His choice had been made in this meeting. </span></p><p><span>In-gong laughed and relieved Zephyr&#x2019;s worry.</span></p><p><span>The night passed by, and the morning of the coronation dawned brightly. </span></p><p><span>&amp; </span></p><p><span>Everybody was gathered in the Demon King&#x2019;s Palace. </span><span>Lords, various officials, and influential figures from other areas were lined up on the left and right of the red carpet leading up to the elevated altar.</span></p><p><span>As In-gong sat in the waiting room, he looked at a welcome face. They were outdoors, not indoors, and many things were different, but he couldn&#x2019;t help feeling nostalgic. </span></p><p><span>&#x201C;These clothes are still tight.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span> Carack, who wore a black suit, said as he touched his neck. Instead of answering, In-gong stood up. </span></p><p><span>&#x201C;9th Prince&#x2019;s entry.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Isabella called from the podium. It was the last time he would officially be called the 9th Prince. This wasn&#x2019;t a bad thing, but he couldn&#x2019;t help feeling regret. </span></p><p><span>As In-gong stepped on the red carpet, Carack followed quietly behind him, and those on the left and right bowed their heads. </span></p><p><span>In-gong saw Ferocious Eyes and Vandal. He also saw Nayatra and the other children of the concubines. </span></p><p><span>The finely dressed Felicia, Caitlin, and Anastasia were waiting at the altar. Felicia was wearing a red dress with a high degree of exposure as always, while Caitlin wore a blue dress which gave off a cute feeling. It was due to Chris&#x2019; influence that her shoulders were covered up. </span></p><p><span>Anastasia, standing beside them, was dressed in white and looked like an elegant goddess. </span></p><p><span>Felicia&#x2019;s smiling eyes could be seen above her fan. Caitlin laughed brightly, while Anastasia smiled and moved a little closer to In-gong. The sword duke was standing close to the altar with a crown in his hands.</span></p><p><span>It was a new crown which Amita had created just for today. Amita was a slave to the Heavenly Wine as always, so they had made it despite their tail thumping against the ground. It was a joyful day, so In-gong had provided Amita with enough Heavenly Wine to make them smile happily. </span></p><p><span>The effect continued on. Despite wearing a collar, Amita was shaking their tail with a happy face from where they stood by the sword duke&#x2019;s feet. Behind Amita and the sword duke, Daphne was smiling. </span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Go.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Carack stopped in front of the altar and said in a small voice. In-gong looked at Carack before nodding. </span><span>Then In-gong stepped onto the altar. Felicia, Caitlin, and Anastasia walked behind In-gong as he followed the sword duke toward the highest point of the altar. </span></p><p><span>The throne of the demon king... </span></p><p><span>In-gong had inherited it after Mitra. The previous demon king had always been silent but never heartless. Rather, he was a warm-hearted person. </span></p><p><span>The Protector of the Demon World...&#xA0;</span><span>Mitra was the Watcher of the Demon World. </span></p><p><span>Felicia&#x2019;s eyes were red. In-gong gently wiped at Felicia&#x2019;s eyes before standing before his throne. He then looked out over the Demon King&#x2019;s Palace. </span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Master, how great.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Green Wind said as she suddenly appeared. Due to being upgraded to an apostle for this occasion, she looked like a goddess.&#xA0;</span><span>Although Green Wind wasn&#x2019;t a queen or concubine, she was sensitive to the occasion. It was important for her to be with In-gong. </span></p><p><span>&#x201C;My master.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>The white woman with a golden crown appeared in front of In-gong and took the crown from the sword duke. &#xA0;</span><span>She stared directly at In-gong and declared in a soft voice, </span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Punishment, obedience, governance.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>It was the true power of Conquest.&#xA0;</span><span>The white woman bowed to In-gong, then she placed the golden crown on his head. </span></p><p><span>This was the birth of the new demon king. The queens of the former demon king looked at In-gong with a mixture of regret and joy. Chris and Silvan applauded loudly, while Baikal smiled. Victor clapped with an awkward expression, but no one paid attention to him. Clearly, things were still awkward with him. </span></p><p><span>Zephyr gave a wry smile and clapped. Altesia laughed and pulled at his arms, while Locke stood next to Zephyr in silence. </span></p><p><span>&#x201C;In-gong.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Felicia said, grasping In-gong&#x2019;s arms gently. In-gong smiled at her uncomfortable tone and said, </span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Don&#x2019;t overdo it.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Yes, Shutra.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>She had heard all about it from In-gong, but nothing had changed. In-gong was still the In-gong whom she&#x2019;d encountered at the Red Lightning tribe. He was the person whom Felicia had loved from beginning to end. </span></p><p><span>Caitlin saw what Felicia was doing and pulled at In-gong&#x2019;s other arm. In-gong laughed and asked Caitlin, </span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Noona, can I request it just this once?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span>It seemed appropriate to hear it at this moment. </span><span>Felicia laughed as she understood what he was asking for. Green Wind looked at them with discontent, while Anastasia shook her head. </span></p><p><span>Caitlin&#x2019;s cheeks became slightly red at In-gong&#x2019;s request. It was embarrassing to be asked to do it. </span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Shutra is amazing.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Caitlin muttered in a low voice, but she was smiling brightly. </span></p><p><span>In-gong kissed Caitlin&#x2019;s forehead. Then after kissing Felicia as well, In-gong looked up at the sky.</span></p><p><span>It was a happy ending which completely broke the ending of Knight Saga. </span><span>He had crushed that ending with his own hands. </span></p><p><span>In-gong grinned.</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p><p>Breakers is officially complete!!!</p><p>Thank for you my editor LD, who has been with me since the beginning of the story and has managed to do everything I asked, no matter how crazy. Thank you to the readers for following this work until the end.&#xA0;For all the patrons who donated, I truly appreciate all of it.</p><p>This might not be the full end, as the author has expressed interest in writing some side stories.</p><p>So I hope to see you all on my next two works, which will be releasing sometime next week.
