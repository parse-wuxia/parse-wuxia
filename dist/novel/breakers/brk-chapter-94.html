Seira, who was walking next to him, responded in a small voice,</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Rather, won&#x2019;t they be similar to Green Wind?&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">That was a likely story. If Green Wind was a person who had the power of the wind, it was possible that the last flame was one with the power of fire.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Either way, it is intriguing.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Felicia said with a smile. It was good for her. Encountering unknown knowledge always excited her.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;Amazing.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Caitlin said in a small voice and Delia nodded. Amita, who was leading the way, suddenly stopped walking. Their long tail pounded against the ground as they shouted,</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;I only called 9th Prince, so why are there so many followers?&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Amita&#x2019;s anger was understandable. It was literally a procession.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Felicia and Caitlin were on either side of In-gong and Silvan was next to Felicia. The aides, Carack, Seira and Delia, followed by Daphne, were behind the princes and princesses,</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Amita was angry, but it was more cute than scary, simply because they were a raccoon. Moreover, there was one person in the party who could handle Amita comfortably.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;Amita, I&#x2019;ll hug you.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Daphne opened her arms and said to Amita. Amita then turned to Daphne and nodded.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;I won&#x2019;t refuse.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">They coughed a few times in embarrassment and Daphne hugged Amita with a gentle smile.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">The party followed the gentle Amita and went to a small temple nearby. It was a little bit larger than the temple on Enger Plains and was built entirely of wood. It wasn&#x2019;t made from cut trees, but the trees themselves had tangled together into the shape of a house.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">As they passed through the entrance at the tree trunks, there was a large space with a little girl standing in the middle. She was a short-haired girl dressed in a white dress.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;The guardian of Spider Forest.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">In-gong looked at the girl in surprise after hearing Amita&#x2019;s words. Robin had talked about a big spider, so he had never imagined she would be a little girl.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&apos;It isn&#x2019;t a body. It is like some type of terminal. Moreover, she seems to be a young guardian based on her appearance. A large spider might have been the guardian in the past, but based on her appearance, the previous mess is understandable. She seems young and weak, without the strength to fight.&#x2019;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">In-gong jumped as he heard Green Wind&#x2019;s words. &#x2018;A young guardian? There&#x2019;s even something like this? And the former guardian was a spider. Does that mean a guardian can give birth?&#x2019;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">He was full of questions that he wanted to ask, but the situation wasn&#x2019;t good.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">The girl guardian lifted the hem of her dress slightly and curtsied.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;I am Kafran, the guardian of Spider Forest. Thank you for saving me.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">He wondered where she learned how to curtsy. &#x2018;Did Amita teach her?&#x2019;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">In-gong laughed at the thought of a raccoon teaching her courtesies and called Green Wind.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;Green Wind.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Green Wind took a solid form next to In-gong. Unlike the party that was accustomed to seeing Green Wind, Kafran made a surprised face when she saw Green Wind.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">In-gong turned to Green Wind and said,</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Share your stories. Isn&#x2019;t this a rare opportunity?&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">It was a chance for guardians to talk to each other.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Like In-gong said, it was a rare opportunity. Kafran&#x2019;s eyes sparkled and Green Wind also seemed excited by the prospect, but that was only for a moment. Green Wind frowned and said hesitantly,</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;But I have to follow Master...&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;It doesn&#x2019;t matter. Only 9th Prince can face the last flame alone.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Amita said in a stiff voice. However, Kafran seemed pleased.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">In-gong stroked Green Wind&#x2019;s head lightly.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;I will be back.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;I understand, Master. Come back safely. It would be good if you can buy me a gift.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Green Wind laughed happily. In-gong chuckled at the words &#x2018;buy me a gift.&#x2019;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Who taught you to say that?&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Carack taught me.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Everyone&#x2019;s gazes turned toward Carack who simply had shameless expression on his face.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">While they were all laughing, Amita shouted,</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Do you plan to stay here all day? Let&apos;s go!&quot;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Green Wind remained with Kafran while Felicia and Caitlin showed interest in their conversation. Silvan, Delia and Seira stayed still while Carack and Daphne, who was carrying Amita, followed In-gong deep into the temple.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">They stopped in front of a black door and Amita jumped down from Daphne&#x2019;s arms.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;It is up to here. Only 9th Prince can enter.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Daphne was sad since she wanted to see the last flame, but Amita didn&#x2019;t tolerate anyone other than In-gong.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Carack stepped back with Daphne and grinned at In-gong.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Enjoy yourself.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;Yes.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">There was a gentle light inside the door. Small blue lights, reminiscent of fireflies, filled the room that had an approximate radius of two meters.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">In the middle of the room, a green fire was burning on a small altar. It was a small flame that was only the size of Amita, but he couldn&#x2019;t take it lightly. This was a flame that gave off an unusual energy.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Amita jumped on the altar and pointed to the green flame.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;This is the last flame. Put your hand inside it.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;Huh?&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Put his hand in the fire?</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;It&#x2019;s okay. This isn&#x2019;t an ordinary flame. Do I have to explain everything like this?&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;I understand.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">In-gong replied to Amita, who had taken out a pipe, and approached the last flame. After taking a deep breath, In-gong put his hands into the fire.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Amita&#x2019;s words were true. Rather than hot, the flame was warm. He didn&#x2019;t feel his skin burn.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">In-gong slowly moved his hands further into the flame and it grew bigger. Suddenly, the now larger flame swallowed up In-gong&#x2019;s body.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Instead of screaming, In-gong closed his eyes reflexively and soon found himself standing in a completely different place.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">The world was on fire.&#xA0;</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">It was a place filled with green fire.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">However, rather than the negative representation of hell, In-gong was reminded of something else. It was an awkward expression, but if he had to name it, he would call it the Kingdom of Fire.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">The beautiful and mysterious green flames bloomed like flowers and the warmth seemed to be melting In-gong&#x2019;s heart.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">In-gong stabilized his breathing. The flames in front of him parted to the sides and revealed the existence behind them.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">It was a woman made of flames.&#xA0;</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">She looked like a young girl as well as an unmarried woman. Due to the flickering flames, her appearance seemed to change constantly.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">The last flame.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">According to legend, it was also the first flame.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">She sat down on her throne of fire and looked down at In-gong. As she smiled through her blazing hair, a throne came up behind In-gong and the two thrones neared each other.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;It is nice to meet you, Conquest Knight.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">The last flame spoke. In-gong stared at the last flame with surprise and she laughed at him.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;You are a Conquest Knight with the power of Conquest. I couldn&#x2019;t help but notice since you used the power in front of my avatar.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Avatar...&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Indeed. Amita is my avatar&#x2014; a cute and lovable child.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">In-gong gave a small laugh. At the very least, their outward appearance was cute and lovely.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">The last flame smiled at In-gong and crossed her legs. She leaned her head against her arm supported by the armrest and said,</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Your eyes are filled with wonder and confusion. Don&#x2019;t you know what a Conquest Knight is?&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">In-gong nodded. It was the first time he could have a conversation about what a Conquest Knight was. This wasn&#x2019;t the time to be ashamed of his ignorance.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Yes, I don&apos;t know. But I would like to know.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">His desire to know had become stronger after her words. The last flame spoke again,</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;How funny.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">The last flame was a queen. She uncrossed her folded legs and straightened her posture. Seeming to gaze into the distance, she recited a poem,</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Conquest, War, Death and Famine - the Four Knights of the Apocalypse.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Flames rose up around the throne. The green flames started forming shapes: a crown to symbolize Conquest; a sword symbolizing War; a sickle symbolizing Death; and an empty bowl symbolizing Famine.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;They are the riders of the end and the ones longing for the destruction of the world.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">The flames erased the symbols. It was like the symbols had burnt and destroyed themselves.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x2018;Those who crave destruction.&#x2019;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x2018;The ones who would cause the end.&#x2019;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">It seemed to be a natural story; War, death and famine - they were all words with negative connotations.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">The last flame leaned back against her throne. She observed In-gong and said,</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;However, you are a little bit- no, very different. Why are you a Conquest Knight?&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">The last flame stopped talking. Then she stared intensely at In-gong and continued,</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;The Knights of the Apocalypse are those who crave destruction. It isn&#x2019;t because they are Knights of the Apocalypse. They were chosen as knights because they already&#xA0;</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt"><em>have</em></span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#xA0;those urges.&quot;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">The only Knight of the Apocalypse that In-gong had faced directly was Gerard, the Famine Knight.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">He was crazy.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">He enjoyed destruction and slaughter and even tried to kill his own kin.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;You don&#x2019;t wish for destruction nor do you enjoy destruction and slaughter. Moreover, you aren&#x2019;t affected much.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Affected?&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">He asked reflexively and the last flame laughed. She formed two flames which were connected by a thin line of fire in the air.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Those who have been selected as a Knight of the Apocalypse &#x2014; Conquest, War, Death, and Famine - those are the only things that can be expressed. The Knights of the Apocalypse are strongly affected by them. That is how their strength is able to grow. Under that influence, they will try to bring an end to the world. But you are different. You are almost unaffected by Conquest. Conquest also doesn&#x2019;t want to conquer you. Rather...&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">The last flame became hazy as she smiled. Her eyes narrowed and she whispered,</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Maybe she is hoping to be conquered by you.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">The golden-crowned woman with red and blue eyes...</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">She had never tried to manipulate In-gong and only revealed her appearance and voice when In-gong was in a crisis.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;This is just my guesswork. In fact, this is the first time I&#x2019;ve encountered a Knight of the Apocalypse. I have said all that I know.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">The last flame laughed and crossed her legs again.
