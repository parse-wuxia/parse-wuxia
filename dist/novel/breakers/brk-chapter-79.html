Gerard&#x2019;s deep-seated grudge and resentment dyed his aura into a dark s</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">had</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">e.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Chris had a hunch when Gerard blew away several lycanthrope soldiers in his first attack.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Ordinary soldiers wouldn&#x2019;t be able to deal with him. Considering the strange power he used, there was a possibility</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#xA0;that rather than exhausted,&#xA0;</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">he would be strengthened.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">It would just be a futile sacrifice. Even though it was risky, Chris had to do it himself.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Chris struck Gerard from the front. Caitlin used to time to make up for Chris by piercing through the gap.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">A pincer move that couldn&#x2019;t be done with just anyone. They needed to be aware of each other&#x2019;s breaths as well as what attacks were on the way. In a pincer move, those who couldn&#x2019;t engage with each other weren&#x2019;t able to create gaps.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Chris and Caitlin&#x2019;s pincer move was perfect</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#xA0;as t</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">he two of them knew each other very well. It wasn&#x2019;t an exaggeration to say that they were two different bodies moving as one.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Gerard wasn&#x2019;t pushed at all by the stormy joint attack. He proved why he&#xA0;</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">had been</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#xA0;called the strongest lycanthrope 20 years ago b</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">y</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#xA0;blocking all the attacks from Chris and Caitlin. It was so exquisite that it was like the three people were dancing.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">The lycanthrope soldiers didn&#x2019;t dare get in the way of the three people. Felicia had gathered magic power in her hands, but she couldn&#x2019;t do anything.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">In-gong breathed calmly as he observed the s</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">cene</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">. Despite drawing with Caitlin in the spar, he wouldn&#x2019;t be able to interfere. I</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">f&#xA0;</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">n-gong moved</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">,</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#xA0;it was more likely that he would ruin their flow.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x2018;The power of Famine.&#x2019;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Gerard drained the life force of the lycanthrope soldiers. After the life force was robbed, the black energy was visibly strengthened.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x2018;Direct contact is needed.&#x2019;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">It wasn&#x2019;t enough to touch the body</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">; t</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">ime was needed. Compared to I</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">n-gong&#x2019;s &#x2018;Conquest&#x2019;, h</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">is command was &#x2018;Drain&#x2019;. Maybe, it was even a single process.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Famine Knight.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Now that he had time to think about it</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">,</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#xA0;Gerard had inherited the power of Famine from the man in black robes who&#xA0;</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">had been</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#xA0;on the slab.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">However,</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#xA0;weren&#x2019;t the four people in the picture on one side? Were they hostile to each other?&#xA0;</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Otherwise</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">, was Conquest rejected by the other three?&#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;Below the King&#x2019;s Flag!&#x201D;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">In-gong stopped his thoughts and used the power of Conquest. The moment the dwarf dagger hit the ground, a white aura covered Chris and Caitlin.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">There was a change in the movements of Chris, Caitlin and Gerard who&#xA0;</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">had been</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#xA0;like precision machines.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Chris and Caitlin were disconcerted by the support but soon adapted to their stronger bodies. They started pushing Gerard faster than ever.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Gerard was at a loss for a moment as he gazed at the two people. He glared at In-gong as his black aura rose vividly.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x2018;</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Conquest Knight.</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Gerard didn&#x2019;t say anything</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">, b</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">ut In-gong</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">heard Gerard&#x2019;s voice c</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">learly</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">. The whirlwind of Chris and Caitlin&#x2019;s pincer attack erased his voice, but In-gong couldn&#x2019;t forget it.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">The three people became more violent.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Gerard, who was stuck between the two people, suddenly laughed and released a power of Famine that was greater than before.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">It was only for a moment, but the shape was clear. The black aura reached Caitlin&#x2019;s dark blue aura and Chris&#x2019; blue aura</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">, placing</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#xA0;a brake on the movements of the two people.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Chris shattered Famine by strengthening his aura</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">, b</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">ut Caitlin couldn&#x2019;t. Her movements were stopped and Gerard didn&#x2019;t miss this gap.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">The change was rapid and instant. Gerard stood firmly as he took one of Chris&#x2019; blows and headed toward Caitlin. Gerard&#x2019;s left arm shot toward her like a snake. Chris&#x2019; eyes widened. Caitlin felt Gerard&#x2019;s palm touching her abdomen</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#xA0;a</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">nd the balance collapsed.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;Caitlin!&#x201D;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Felicia screamed desperately. Caitlin&#x2019;s slender body flew into the air and Chris&#x2019; fist aimed for Gerard again.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Gerard didn&#x2019;t face this fist. He pushed strength into his legs and jumped up after Caitlin. His palm struck Caitlin&#x2019;s abdomen again like a lightning strike!&#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt"><em>Kwang!</em></span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Caitlin was pushed vertically towards the ground. There was a deafening roar as red blood burst out.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Gerard landed on the ground</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">, t</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">hen slammed</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#xA0;his knee d</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">own&#xA0;</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">on Caitlin.&#xA0;</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Caitlin</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#xA0;coughed up blood again and Chris roared like a beast.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Gerard glanced at Chris</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#xA0;and</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#xA0;used one hand&#xA0;</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">to</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#xA0;throw Caitlin at Chris.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Chris was relentless. He swallowed his tears and flew forward. Instead of taking Caitlin, he moved toward Gerard. Caitlin rolled on the ground as he exchanged blows with Gerard.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">A loud shock shook the atmosphere. The blue aura and black aura exploded together and parts of the ground,&#xA0;</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">which</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#xA0;couldn&#x2019;t survive the violence, collapsed.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Felicia ran forward despite the risk. She grabbed Caitlin and dragged her away. Carack and Seira followed quickly while White Eagle flew behind Felicia to protect her.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">The light went out. Chris was coughing up blood and it was the same for Gerard as well. It was the result of them striking each other&#x2019;s chest with a devastating strike.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Chris shouted as he swung a fist. It had a strong momentum, but Gerard didn&#x2019;t avoid it. Unlike Chris, he still had one trick remaining.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Beast Form</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">:</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">The true power of the lycanthropes.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Gerard&#x2019;s upper body swelled up</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#xA0;and a</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#xA0;wolf</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">-</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">like roar burst from his mouth.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Chris and Gerard&#x2019;s blows struck each other</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#xA0;and t</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">he exchange turned into a slugfest.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">The ground shook again. The momentum of their fists tore through the atmosphere and the broken pieces of aura destroyed everything they touched. The surrounding terrain started to change due to the</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">m</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">It had only been one minute at most</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">, b</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">ut at the end of that time, which felt like hundreds of minutes, Chris couldn&#x2019;t stand up properly. His blue aura was on the verge of being snuffed, like a candle about to go out, and he fell down as both his knees were broken.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Gerard&#x2019;s hand grabbed Chris. He was also a mess, but he had more room to move than Chris.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">He looked at Chris. There was a warm smile on his face that was unthinkable in this situation</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">. Then Gerard</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#xA0;triggered the power of Famine!&#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Gigantic - Piston!&#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">As everybody stopped, In-gong&#x2019;s white aura exploded.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Since the beginning of the battle, In-gong had only been focused on Gerard. Once Chris&#x2019; aura went down, Gerard revealed a gap. The moment he was drunk with the joy of victory, In-gong moved.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">The giant fist moved through the surrounding area</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#xA0;a</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">nd In-gong sensed It would hit. In-gong aimed for&#xA0;</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Gerard&#x2019;s</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#xA0;chest but Gerard caught the blow in his left shoulder and he flew through the air.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Gerard stared at In-gong</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">.</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#xA0;In-gong was also staring at Gerard</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">, b</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">ut this wasn&#x2019;t the end. Gigantic Piston had struck Gerard&#x2019;s body. It was a unique opportunity given to In-gong.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Earth Quaker roared</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#xA0;as h</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">e had invoked Dragon Blood before using Gigantic Piston. Shortly after their eyes crossed, In-gong poured out a series of attacks toward Gerard.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Gerard was clearly strong. In relation to martial arts, he was in a place far above In-gong.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">However,</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#xA0;he was tired. The battle with Chris had damaged him&#xA0;</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">and</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#xA0;Gigantic Piston</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#xA0;then went on to&#xA0;</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">smash the rest of him.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">So,&#xA0;</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">In-gong&#xA0;</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">now had to see it through to the end. If&#xA0;</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">he</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#xA0;collapsed, the others wouldn&#x2019;t be able to survive.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Gerard couldn&#x2019;t use his left arm</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">, so</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#xA0;In-gong aimed for that point. Once the white and black auras clashed, a terrible shockwave covered the whole area.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">The powers of Conquest and Famine also collided. The strength of Conquest was depleted by Famine&#x2019;s power.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Delia and the lycanthropes were protecting Chris and Caitlin. Felicia was curing Caitlin with recovery magic while the lycanthrope soldiers once again formed a circle.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">For Gerard, In-gong was a roadblock. If it wasn&#x2019;t for In-gong, th</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">is</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#xA0;situation would have been over the moment Chris had f</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">a</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">llen. Even if there were dozens of hundreds of ordinary lycanthrope soldiers, Gerard couldn&#x2019;t be captured.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Conquest. Conquest Knight.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Anger rose</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">, but i</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">t wasn&#x2019;t just Gerard&#x2019;s personal anger. Famine was furious</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#xA0;and h</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">e expressed a strong hatred for Conquest.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt"><em>Kwang!</em></span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Once again, his aura exploded</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">, b</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">ut this was different from before. Gerard&#x2019;s right hand turned quickly, creating a repulsi</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">ve</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#xA0;force that pushed at In-gong like a snake. The moment In-gong re</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">alized</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#xA0;it, Gerard&#x2019;s palm was already touching his chest.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">It was the blow that broke Caitlin.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Divine Beast Authority Secret Principle</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">:</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#xA0;Arang.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">It was a</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#xA0;wolf-like aura that struck the enemy&#x2019;s body directly</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">,</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#xA0;collaps</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">ing</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#xA0;it from the inside.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Th</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">is</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#xA0;attack was a success. Like Caitlin, In-gong opened his mouth and spat out blood. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">However,</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#xA0;In-gong wasn&#x2019;t thrown into the air. He stepped back and White Eagle supported In-gong&#x2019;s back. Rather than flying away, In-gong gritted his teeth and raised his head.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Gerard stared at In-gong. At that moment, Daphne hurriedly shouted something&#xA0;</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">at&#xA0;</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">In-gong</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">,</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;Spirit Enlightenment!&#x201D;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">It was urgent. It didn&#x2019;t reach him</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#xA0;completely, but t</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">here was no time to wait for the spirit&#x2019;s power to be completely activated. However, Daphne&#x2019;s magic gave In-gong the strength to take one step.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">In-gong took a step forward. After struggling with his legs. he reached out.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">He had just learnt it</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">, so</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">i</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">t was only level one.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">However,</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#xA0;it was enough.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Divine Beast Authority Secret Principle</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">:</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#xA0;Arang.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">The white aura ate at Gerard&#x2019;s body. The moment Arang struck him, Gerard&#x2019;s eyes widened with amazement and In-gong took a step back. He once again aimed for Gerard&#x2019;s chest!&#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Explosive Power...&#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">It wasn&#x2019;t Divine Beast Authority but Divine Sura Authority!&#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">The white aura slammed into Gerard&#x2019;s chest.&#xA0;</span></p><hr><p><br></p></div><p><br></p>
