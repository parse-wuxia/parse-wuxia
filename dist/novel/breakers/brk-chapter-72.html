A source of life that was connected with the soul and training life force which could allow the power of the soul to reach beyond its limits.</p><p>The sword duke stared at the warm light coming from In-gong&#x2019;s unconscious body. His aura soared like fire and illuminated the surroundings.</p><p>&quot;Interesting.&quot;</p><p>The sword duke knew what was happening inside In-gong&#x2019;s body. He noticed that the aura in front of him had some characteristics of soul power, despite the accomplishment being low.</p><p>It was unexpected. He had never imagined this would happen when he decided to teach Sura Heart Law.</p><p>&#x201C;I&#x2019;d like to take him to the sanctuary.&#x201D;</p><p>However, he couldn&#x2019;t. He was frustrated because In-gong was so amazing.</p><p>&#x201C;There is no understanding. It isn&#x2019;t done consciously... He did it unconsciously. It&#x2019;s hard to tell if this can be called a talent or something else.&#x201D;</p><p>He said in a voice full of admiration. Felicia, who had been listening by his side, grabbed the sword duke&#x2019;s arm like she couldn&#x2019;t bear it anymore.</p><p>&#x201C;Sword Duke, what do you mean? Shutra is okay, right?&#x201D;</p><p>The sword duke wasn&#x2019;t angry despite being tugged. He patted Felicia&#x2019;s head like he was comforting a small child.</p><p>&quot;You don&#x2019;t have to worry about Prince. Shall we just keep observing him? He&#x2019;ll regain consciousness quickly. And about what happened... I just taught Prince how to use Sura Heart Law, the aura management technique.&#x201D;</p><p>The sword duke spoke lightly but Felicia wasn&#x2019;t listening. She ignored the sword duke&#x2019;s hands still stroking her head and covered her mouth with both hands.</p><p>&#x201C;Sura Heart Law!&#x201D;</p><p>Felicia knew about the aura management method. It was the aura management method that Gallehed, strongest of the five captains, had learnt. It was particularly well-known among the suras.</p><p>Yet he had taught In-gong Sura Heart Law.</p><p>Felicia looked back at In-gong hurriedly while Carack, who had been listening to the conversation, grunted with admiration.</p><p>Karma noticed his reaction and asked Carack in a small voice,</p><p>&#x201C;Carack, what is Sura Heart Law?&#x201D;</p><p>&quot;I don&apos;t know but based on Princess&#x2019; reaction, it seems to be great!&#x201D;</p><p>The sword duke laughed at Carack&#x2019;s answer.</p><p>&quot;These are good friends. Prince seems to be good at finding them.&#x201D;</p><p>Carack smiled at the praise. Karma responded to the sword duke with a small, timid smile.</p><p>In this situation, Felicia was the only one serious as she grabbed the sword duke&#x2019;s hand again.</p><p>&#x201C;You only taught him Sura Heart Law?&#x201D;</p><p>If the sword duke only taught Sura Heart Law, then In-gong wouldn&#x2019;t have this response. There was something more important.</p><p>The sword duke spoke without hiding anything,</p><p>&quot;Prince has combined Sura Heart Law with Divine Beast Authority.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Huh?&#x201D;</p><p>&quot;Two different aura management techniques have been combined. Based on Divine Beast Authority, a better aura management technique has been born.</p><p>He shrugged like it wasn&#x2019;t that great.</p><p>Felicia fell into chaos again. Although she hadn&#x2019;t learnt aura, her brother Silvan Doomblade had outstanding skills in aura. Therefore, she couldn&#x2019;t easily accept the sword duke&#x2019;s words.</p><p>Combining different aura management methods?</p><p>So soon after learning one of them?</p><p>It defied common sense, but she didn&#x2019;t think that the sword duke was lying.</p><p>The sword duke spoke with a generous understanding.</p><p>&quot;Even Prince doesn&#x2019;t understand it. It took place unconsciously. So, it is interesting. Frankly speaking, it is fun. Aside from 2nd Prince, there is another monster.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Sword Duke.&#x201D;</p><p>Felicia called out with mixed emotions. Rather than responding, the sword duke turned to In-gong and exclaimed with shining eyes,</p><p>&#x201C;He seems to be waking up.&#x201D;</p><p>The whirling aura around In-gong was now scattering. Focus started to appear in In-gong&#x2019;s eyes.</p><p>&quot;Prince, have you regained consciousness?&#x201D;</p><p>In-gong nodded slowly in response to the sword duke&#x2019;s question. He felt dizzy but it wasn&#x2019;t enough to make him collapse.</p><p>In-gong covered his face with both hands and breathed deeply as he tried to understand what had happened.</p><p>Divine Beast Authority had evolved into Divine Sura Authority. He had acquired a SS rank technique.</p><p>There had only been one SS rank technique that appeared in Knight Saga and that had been Locke&#x2019;s Warrior Sword.</p><p>However, it was different now. Divine Sura Authority had been added to the SS techniques and In-gong was the only one who knew Divine Sura Authority.</p><p>&quot;Prince is more strange than I thought. I did well in coming here.&#x201D;</p><p>The sword duke&#x2019;s playful voice was heard from above him. In-gong removed his hands and faced the sword duke.</p><p>&#x201C;Sword Duke.&#x201D;</p><p>&quot;I won&#x2019;t ask. I also don&#x2019;t need a description. My interest isn&#x2019;t in the principles itself but the fact that Prince accomplished it.&#x201D;</p><p>He answered and adjusted his posture to In-gong&#x2019;s eye level. Then he asked,</p><p>&#x201C;The name?&#x201D;</p><p>He wondered about it. The sword duke already knew everything that had happened in In-gong&#x2019;s body.</p><p>Therefore, In-gong replied truthfully instead of lying,</p><p>&#x201C;Divine Sura Authority.&#x201D;</p><p>&quot;Divine Sura Authority... A simple but good name. I&#x2019;ll look forward to your seeing your accomplishments grow. I&#x2019;ll be watching.&#x201D;</p><p>The sword duke finished with a strange smile before stepping backwards. Then Felicia came to In-gong like she had been waiting.</p><p>&quot;Shutra, are you okay?&#x201D;</p><p>Felicia&#x2019;s eyes were red. In-gong laughed and nodded.</p><p>&quot;Yes, I&#x2019;m okay. Thank you for caring, Noona.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;You are okay. It&apos;s a good thing.&#x201D;</p><p>Felicia sighed with relief and Carack started to laugh heartily. Then the sword duke, who was watching, knocked against Felicia&#x2019;s shoulder.</p><p>&#x201C;Princess, there is something I wanted to ask you.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Me?&#x201D;</p><p>&quot;Yes. How familiar has 9th Prince and 6th Princess become?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Huh?&#x201D;</p><p>Felicia narrowed her eyes, but the sword duke asked again with a serious expression.</p><p>&quot;I mean it. How close are the two of you?&#x201D;</p><p>Felicia glanced back reflexively at In-gong with an unsure expression. She covered her face and replied hesitantly,</p><p>&#x201C;Well... I don&#x2019;t dislike him?&#x201D;</p><p>Carack stared at Felicia incredulously while Karma held back her laughter. In-gong looked at Felicia&#x2019;s reddening ears and said mischievously,</p><p>&#x201C;Really? What if I really like Noona?&#x201D;</p><p>&quot;Ohh!&#x201D;</p><p>Felicia&#x2019;s face reddened. She made a helpless sound out of embarrassment.</p><p>The sword duke sighed,</p><p>&quot;It is a bit strange to see such embarrassment, but it is good.&#x201D;</p><p>Instead of replying, Felicia simply pouted. The sword duke continued speaking,</p><p>&#x201C;6th Princess, I am telling you to protect 9th Prince. Keep today&#x2019;s work a secret.&#x201D;</p><p>It was clear what he was talking about.</p><p>It was the birth of Divine Sura Authority; In-gong had created a new aura management method.</p><p>&#x201C;There is already quite a lot of interest in 9th Prince. There is no need to increase the gazes.&#x201D;</p><p>Felicia nodded at the words. She was also aware of all the eyes on In-gong. The events at Thunderdoom Fortress would probably attract even more attention.</p><p>&#x201C;You can tell 5th Prince. 7th Prince and 8th Princess are fine as well. They were the ones who taught him Divine Beast Authority.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;I understand. I&#x2019;ll do so.&#x201D;</p><p>Once again, Felicia made a relieved smile as she turned towards In-gong. In-gong was also smiling back at Felicia.</p><p>&quot;Okay, then it will be nice to take a break after that.&#x201D;</p><p>The sword duke&#x2019;s words relieved all the tension at once. Then Felicia recalled something and asked the sword duke,</p><p>&#x201C;Ah, that reminds me. Where is the hole that you came down from? Can we bring an exploration team down here?&#x201D;</p><p>Thunderdoom Fortress&#x2019; control room was in their hands, so they just needed to eat up the profit now. It was a good idea to bring an exploration team to conduct a full-scale investigation.</p><p>However, an unexpected reply came from the sword duke.</p><p>&quot;It is possible, but do you really want to? There is no reason to do that.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Huh?&#x201D;</p><p>There was no reason to do that? What did this mean?</p><p>Felicia and In-gong looked at each other while the sword duke laughed.</p><p>&quot;Is this your first time exploring ruins? If an expedition comes, you can&#x2019;t swallow everything.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Uh... Sword Duke?&#x201D;</p><p>Were they hearing properly right now?</p><p>In-gong had a bemused expression on his face while Felicia was in a stupor.</p><p>The sword duke clicked his tongue and continued to talk,</p><p>&quot;You have suffered in a fortress of this magnitude, yet you want to give it to the Demon King&#x2019;s Palace? You should take care of it properly. Anyway, the treasures will just go somewhere else after being received by the Demon King&#x2019;s Palace. So, just call the expedition after you have collected everything. The Demon King did the same when he was a prince. Why shouldn&#x2019;t Prince and Princess do this?&#x201D;</p><p>He winked lightly at the end.</p><p>Now, In-gong started to feel disoriented.</p><p>However, the sword duke didn&#x2019;t care about In-gong&#x2019;s and Felicia&#x2019;s reactions and pointed to a distant place.</p><p>&quot;In particular, the body of that black dragon. Take it. It will be useful in many ways. It will be nice if it is broken down into three.</p><p>At that moment, something flashed in In-gong&#x2019;s head. Felicia exclaimed,</p><p>&quot;Wait, wait a minute. Into three?&#x201D;</p><p>Dividing into three? Was that right?</p><p>&quot;Payment for travel expenses. Isn&#x2019;t that right?&#x201D;</p><p>The sword duke said with a pleased grin while In-gong and Felicia had the same expression on their faces.</p><p>&amp;</p><p>The sword duke took Carack and Karma to the body of the black dragon, Partizan. It was in order to disassemble Partizan&#x2019;s body.</p><p>Rather than following the sword duke, In-gong grabbed Felicia&#x2019;s hand.</p><p>&quot;Noona, please wait as I have something to say.&#x201D;</p><p>Felicia turned back to In-gong and nodded. Once the sword duke&#x2019;s group was a sufficient distance away, she spoke first.</p><p>&quot;Is it about the magic that puts things away in another space?&#x201D;</p><p>As expected, she was a great magician. She had only seen it a few times in today&#x2019;s battle, but she had already grasped the situation.</p><p>In-gong nodded slowly.</p><p>&quot;That&apos;s right. It is about that.&#x201D;</p><p>In-gong kept many of his skills a secret as much as possible..</p><p>His inventory ability was very convenient. Depending on the way it was used, it was a really powerful ability.</p><p>It was better if few people knew about these capabilities. Just like all secrets in the world, the ability of the inventory could only be exercised when kept secret.</p><p>However, In-gong decided to tell Felicia the secret of the inventory. He couldn&#x2019;t keep sneaking items into his space forever. The ease of use of Earth Quaker and White Eagle were also included in his consideration.</p><p>Felicia was a reliable ally. It would be beneficial to disclose the secret of his inventory and it wouldn&#x2019;t harm him.</p><p>Felicia glanced at In-gong. He was like an onion as he was always giving her new surprises.</p><p>&quot;Did you learn it all of a sudden?&#x201D;</p><p>&quot;No, it is a magic that I inherently have.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Can you teach me?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;I&#x2019;m sorry, that is impossible. This isn&#x2019;t the type of magic that can be taught.&#x201D;</p><p>This wasn&#x2019;t a lie. Felicia stared into In-gong&#x2019;s eyes for a moment before nodding.</p><p>&quot;Well, I understand. It hasn&#x2019;t been a long time since we&#x2019;ve become friends. I will keep it a secret.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Thank you.&#x201D;</p><p>Felicia didn&#x2019;t reply. She just approached In-gong closely.</p><p>&quot;Excuse me, what is it?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Do Caitlin and Chris know?&#x201D;</p><p>In-gong rolled his eyes while Felicia covered her face with a fan.</p><p>He refrained from laughing and answered,</p><p>&#x201C;No, the two of them don&#x2019;t know yet.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Really?&#x201D;</p><p>Felicia&#x2019;s voice was cheerful. She looked so cute that In-gong could barely hold back his laughter.</p><p>&quot;Anyway, Noona. Should I reveal the magic to the sword duke?&#x201D;</p><p>There were many items, not including the black dragon&#x2019;s body. At first glance, it seemed like a special magic bag, but he wondered if such a lie would get past the sword duke. They had a good relationship, so he didn&#x2019;t want to spoil it by lying.</p><p>After In-gong&#x2019;s question, Felicia stared at the sword duke and shook her head.</p><p>&#x201C;Will he even care?&#x201D;</p><p>&quot;I was thinking the same thing.&#x201D;</p><p>They had only spent a short time together, but it was enough to understand the sword duke&#x2019;s personality.</p><p>And a few minutes later, the sword duke responded exactly as expected.</p><p>&#x201C;Use it comfortably. I also have a similar tool.&#x201D;</p><p>That was the end. As they disassembled the body of the black dragon, the sword duke pointed to it and asked,</p><p>&quot;Prince and Princess, what are you going to do with it?&#x201D;</p><p>There was damage after it became a zombie dragon, but there were still many parts that could be used.</p><p>In-gong glanced at his Dragon Scale Greaves and replied,</p><p>&quot;I going to use it in the smithy at the Demon King&#x2019;s Palace.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Princess?&#x201D;</p><p>&quot;Me too.&#x201D;</p><p>It was natural. The most outstanding blacksmiths that In-gong and Felicia knew were at the Demon King&#x2019;s Palace.</p><p>However, the sword duke looked displeased.</p><p>&quot;Hmm, the blacksmiths are the Demon King&#x2019;s Palace are very good, but such good materials are a waste for the Demon King&#x2019;s Palace. So, why don&#x2019;t you meet my friend?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Someone you know?&#x201D;</p><p>Felicia&#x2019;s eyes shone. The sword duke like the response and continued,</p><p>&quot;Yes, my interest is deepening, so tell us.</p><p>Who is it?&#x201D;</p><p>In-gong was also excited. A friend of the strongest swordsman, the Sword Duke. He didn&#x2019;t know the name, but he was already looking forward to it.</p><p>The sword duke nodded.</p><p>&quot;Wait a minute. It isn&#x2019;t good to be too excited. Do Prince and Princess know the name Amita?&#x201D;</p><p>Felicia nodded while neither Carack or Karma replied.</p><p>However, In-gong was different.</p><p>His eyes widened and he cried out,</p><p>&#x201C;Amita! Amita Ignasia!&#x201D;</p><p>Of course, he knew it. It was a name that he had to know.</p><p>The meeting with Amita had been a hidden event in Knight Saga!</p><p>Amita Ignasia...</p><p>The best blacksmith in the Demon World who handled the last flame!</p><p>The sword duke&#x2019;s description followed.</p><hr><p><br></p></div><p><br></p>
