He could barely feel the seasons as he wandered around the Demon World, but it was a time when winter was approaching.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">In-gong examined his body inside one of the various small rooms in the small temple. It was strange seeing it after so long.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x2018;I feel like I have too many extra points. Should I start investing some of them?&#x2019;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Thanks to investing additional points in strength, he could suppress Caitlin easily.

It was good to raise all his stats as a whole, but it was better to keep some points just to cope with unexpected situations. So, he could invest the points when he needed to.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Secondly, he hadn&#x2019;t judged what type of stat would be better to invest the points in.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">This was the so-called maximum efficiency.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">In-gong was growing at a fast pace and just with like Divine Sura Authority, it was common to learn new skills. Therefore, he might regret investing the points in one place.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&apos;Of course, I might also regret it if I save the points.&#x2019;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">The time required to invest the points and increase the stats was at least 10 seconds long.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">It was a very short time, but that could be a long time in a battle.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">If he died, everything would over. It was necessary for In-gong to increase his basic capacities in order to face strong opponents such as Gerard and the guardian.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x2018;Let&#x2019;s invest some and leave a few behind.&#x2019;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">In-gong made up his mind and invested seven points each in agility, talent, persistence and durability.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Agility and talent would strengthen Divine Sura Authority while persistence and durability would increase the number of times he could use it.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Altogether, he used 28 points and had 10 points remaining.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">In-gong closed his eyes and focused on his own body. The seven points caused his existing stats to rise by more than 10%. If he concentrated, he could feel the difference.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x2018;I don&#x2019;t know about persistence and durability. In fact, my skills as well.&#x2019;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Still, he could feel the rise in agility. The trajectory of his swinging fist was faster and cleaner than before.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&apos;Maybe I should increase charm.&#x2019;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">In-gong touched his lips involuntarily and laughed. He erased the youthful delusions in his head and activated the skills window.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">[The King&apos;s Knights Lv2]</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Level 25 was a special level, so several skills were automatically increased.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">The most notable among them was The King&apos;s Knights.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">At level two, the number of knights increased from two to four and the performance of Call was enhanced.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">[Call: It is possible to summon a knight once every three days.]</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">The knight captain restriction was lost.

He didn&#x2019;t know what Karma was doing and the restriction of once every three days was never light. He couldn&#x2019;t waste it when he might need Call tomorrow.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x2018;I should be thinking about who I should add as new members.&#x2019;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">The first name that surfaced in his head was Daphne.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Although it was unclear if she belonged to In-gong or Felicia, she had already helped In-gong several times in battle. Furthermore, her spirits and abilities as a druid were very helpful. It was a talent that he couldn&#x2019;t miss.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x2018;I don&#x2019;t know if I can, but... I want to add Caitlin and Felicia.&#x2019;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">He would be able to use Call on both of them.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Almost half the calls he made to Carack were to escape from a crisis. By adding the two people, it would be easier to protect them, especially Felicia.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x2018;I will tell them about it later.&#x2019;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">If he really wanted to aim for demon king, he needed to acquire both of them.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x2018;Let&#x2019;s check the situation.&#x2019;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">As the level of The King&apos;s Knights increased, the enhancement effect on the knights rose. So, that could be used as a material for negotiation.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Next, In-gong checked the battle skills including Divine Sura Authority.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">This time he was able to invest his skill points without worry.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Aura and Arang...</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">He chose to raise Aura, so the amount of aura he had would increase. Additionally, Arang was the only special move that he could invest skill points into.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Even so, it was Arang from Divine Beast Authority, so it used quite a lot of skill points. After raising Aura, the remaining skill points were ambiguous. So, In-gong decided to save them.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x2018;I should train the smaller skills.&#x2019;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">There was quite a bit of progress.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">After he finished checking all his stats and skills, In-gong closed the windows and sat down.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">He thought about the story the last flame told him.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">The Four Knights of the Apocalypse that would cause the end...</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x2018;Conquest.&#x2019;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">The woman with one red and one blue eye...</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">She hadn&#x2019;t make any demands of In-gong. The last flame had said that Conquest was actually hoping to be conquered by In-gong.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">In-gong recalled her; he remembered her eyes and voice when she said that he was her only hope.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Those who crave destruction...</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">And the ones who wanted the end.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">He couldn&#x2019;t believe it.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Was In-gong being deceived? Or did she really want him to be different from War, Death and Famine?</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">The Death Knight.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">He had attacked Green Wind, the guardian of Enger Plains, and Kafran who was the guardian of Spider Forest.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Why was he attacking guardians? Was there some type of connection between attacking the guardians and causing the end of the world?</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">How would they bring about the end?</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">If it wasn&#x2019;t that, what was the Death Knight&#x2019;s aim?</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x2018;Master.&#x2019;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">In the midst of his worries, In-gong heard Green Wind&#x2019;s voice. In-gong opened his eyes and saw Green Wind&#x2019;s smiling face.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Did you enjoy talking to Kafran?&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Green Wind had been with Kafran ever since he entered the small temple.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Green Wind nodded.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;I enjoyed it. Kafran is a very cute and good child. Rather, I smell something different coming from Master.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;Huh?&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Instead of answering, Green Wind brought her face close to In-gong chest and arms and started sniffing.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Is it the smell of another spirit? No, it is a little different. It is different from Kafran. Is this the smell of the last flame?&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">She tilted her head before hugging In-gong. This was different from her normal hugs. She rubbed herself against his body without stopping.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;Excuse me, Green Wind?&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;I am covering you with my smell again. I hate that Master smells of other natural spirits.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">With those words, Green Wind rubbed her cheek against In-gong&#x2019;s shoulder. Rather than being embarrassed, In-gong felt pleased and he laughed.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;Are you jealous right now?&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;Well, I guess.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Felicia would have denied it with a blushing face, but Green Wind was Green Wind. She moved her face closer to In-gong&#x2019;s and her long slender fingers touched In-gong&#x2019;s lips.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;E-excuse me?&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;The strongest trail is over here. I&#x2019;m going to delete it.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x2018;Delete.&#x2019; How was she doing to delete it?</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Green Wind&apos;s face came closer and her breath reached In-gong&#x2019;s lips. Unlike the heat of the last flame, he felt a cool sensation.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">It was at that moment...</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Prince!&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">The door opened with a loud sound and In-gong hurried away from Green Wind. He stood up and asked Carack,</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Huh? What&apos;s going on?&quot;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">In-gong sighed as he asked the question. Maybe Carack truly was a protagonist, or maybe it was just the timing.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x2018;No, this is the effect of my Protagonist Correction.&#x2019;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Prince?&quot;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;No, nothing. I feel both thankful and angry.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">In-gong sat down on the bed again. Carack laughed and approached In-gong.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;Your remark is too exaggerated.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;What&#x2019;s going on?&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">In-gong asked bluntly and Carack revealed the purpose of his visit.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;The raccoon person is looking for Prince.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&amp;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;There aren&#x2019;t enough materials!&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Amita shouted.

Do you want me to just make shoes with leather?&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">In order to create shoes, various materials were needed to fasten the leather together.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">In-gong&#x2019;s Dragon Scale Greaves didn&#x2019;t only contain the scales of a red dragon but also light and durable unidentified metals.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Carack asked from next to In-gong,</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Huh? Isn&#x2019;t Raccoon the best blacksmith? But you don&#x2019;t have any materials?&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Carack stimulated Amita&#x2019;s pride as they brandished a fist at his question.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Your group has too many orders! I need to create more than 10 new pieces of equipment! It is the first time in my life that I have to make such a large amount in a short period of time!

Puoooooh, a full set!&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">In-gong imagined Amita sewing busily while sweating furiously and felt like laughing.

They gave a long sigh and said,</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Thanks and if you want to get the right equipment, acquire the materials. Not much is needed since you have so much of the main materials.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;What kind of materials are needed?

They took out a tobacco pipe from somewhere and continued,</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Sun Lake has metal creatures wandering around.
