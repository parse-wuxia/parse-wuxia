It was the right answer.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">It was Zephyr who had become the demon king in Knight Saga.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">He wanted to confront Zephyr in order to prevent the Day of Massacre, but he had never thought of becoming the demon king. It was because Shutra&#x2019;s position was too low.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Elaine sat down beside In-gong and stared at him with a mixed expression. Then she said with a laugh,</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Well, it is understandable when considering your position so far.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">9th Prince Shutra Ignus was known as the Scraps Prince.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">He was a poor boy who had lost his mother, his biggest supporter, at a young age;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">A poor prince who didn&#x2019;t receive any outside support.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Now, your position has changed, so you should think about it.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Elaine spoke to In-gong in an alluring voice. Then In-gong realized a new fact,</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&apos;They don&#x2019;t look alike.&#x2019;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">She had almost the same face as Caitlin, but she was different. Elaine was a completely different type of person.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;I don&#x2019;t need to hear an answer right now. Once again, just think about it. I&#x2019;ll hear your answer later.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Elaine moved forward like a feline beast. She approached Caitlin, who was sleeping serenely, and touched her cheek.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;Sleep well, my baby.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Elaine bowed and kissed Caitlin&#x2019;s forehead. She lifted her head slowly and lingered her gaze on In-gong again.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">She was cold and warm; there was some uncertainty buried her casualness.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Elaine turned toward the door before saying one last thing to In-gong,</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Take it easy. I&#x2019;ll see you again soon.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;Thank you.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">In-gong&#x2019;s reply was somewhat misleading, but Elaine laughed heartily. She left as abruptly as she had appeared.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">The man by the door closed it. A few seconds passed before Chris laughed.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Then he said,</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;My advice?&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">In-gong turned to Chris and realized that a person could be incredibly hateful. He snapped at Chris who was smiling mischievously.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;Why didn&#x2019;t you tell me that the 4th Queen was coming?&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Then that would be no fun.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">As expected, he received a hateful reply in return. Chris laughed like a villain and said again,</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Anyhow, you should really think about it. About becoming the demon king, that is.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">He spoke lightly, but the expression in his eyes was serious. No, from the start, this had been a subject that couldn&#x2019;t be dealt with lightly.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Today had been the first time In-gong had encountered 4th Queen Elaine Moonlight. Regardless, it wasn&#x2019;t normal to ask someone if they wanted to become a demon king.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">There were three possible reasons behind this.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Elaine was really casual, she was genuine or someone had evaluated In-gong for her.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">In-gong thought it was the third reason. If it was the third reason, there was only one person it could be.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Chris Moonlight, the 4th Queen&apos;s eldest son and the one she trusted most in the world... The one who would be king of the lycanthropes and who was already walking on that path.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Elaine&apos;s question was soon asked by Chris who wondered if In-gong intended to become the demon king.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Chris liked jokes, but he would never make light of this. He wasn&#x2019;t the type of person who would ask In-gong this question casually.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Chris was hoping that In-gong would become the demon king.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">In-gong took a step back in his mind and looked at this incident from far away.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">In a common monarchy, it was treason for someone who wasn&#x2019;t the Crown Prince to think of becoming the king.&#xA0;</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Just saying that they wanted to become king would ignite a dangerous blaze.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">However, the Demon World was different.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Since the beginning, there had never been such a thing as a fixed Crown Prince. The strongest royal child would become the demon king. There was no discrimination between man and woman or against age.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Therefore, it was natural for the children of the demon king to be encouraged.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">However, this was somewhat distant from reality.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">To become a demon king, they had to be the strongest and many things were required in order to become the strongest.&#xA0;</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Out of the royal children, there were only three who sincerely sought out to become the demon king:</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">1st Prince Baikal Ragnaros;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">2nd Prince Zephyr Ragnaros;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">And 4th Princess Anastasia Nekrion.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">In Knight Saga, Chris hadn&#x2019;t been greedy about becoming the demon king. He was hostile and vigilant toward Zephyr, but he didn&#x2019;t engage actively in any faction rivalry.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Yet he was now asking about the demon king position.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">In-gong breathed in deeply as he thought about it. He narrowed down his thoughts and asked Chris instead of replying to him,</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Why me?&quot;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">In-gong could guess to some extent, but he wanted to hear it from Chris.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Instead of answering right away, Chris straightened his posture. He was buried deep in the chair, but his size was so big that the chair seemed like it would burst.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Chris got into a comfortable position and smiled.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Perhaps I am being too premature... and it&#xA0;</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt"><em>is</em></span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#xA0;somewhat awkward to talk about.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Every person had a different way of talking. According to the situation and the person he was talking to, Chris&#x2019; tone would change.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">He gave a long sigh. Instead of his normal mischievous expression, his face was calm like when he had been discussing the withdrawal from the Red Lightning tribe.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;I can&#x2019;t become the demon king but Shutra can.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Chris&apos; words didn&#x2019;t end there. He raised his hand and concentrated aura on his fist. The blue aura seemed very cold.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;I am strong, a so-called genius.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">It was obvious that he was speaking seriously.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Chris was a genius. At the age of 17, he had a strength comparable to that of the senior generals of the Demon King&#x2019;s Palace. His growth rate was indeed terrifying.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;However, it isn&#x2019;t overwhelming. At best, it is only a similar level to Silvan. I can&#x2019;t come close to 1st Prince Baikal in 10 years time. Not to mention the distance with 2nd Prince who can be described as a monster.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">The 5th Prince Silvan Doomblade, Felicia&#x2019;s twin brother and prince of the dark elves, he was a genius comparable to Chris.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">So was 1st Prince Baikal, who was good at both the sword and magic. Baikal was in the mid-twenties and it was said that he was comparable to the five captains.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Chris didn&#x2019;t mention it but 4th Princess Anastasia was also a genius in her area. If Felicia was a capable magician, Anastasia was a monster when it came to magic. There was a good reason why she led one of the three factions instead of her brother, 3rd Prince Victor.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Then there was 2nd Prince Zephyr Ragnaros.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">In Knight Saga, Zephyr had been powerful. Moreover, he had been the protagonist and had become strong at a tremendous speed.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">However, the current Zephyr seemed stronger than the Zephyr of Knight Saga. Once he gathered all the stories he had heard indirectly, he was forced to come to such a conclusion.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;The forces of the lycanthropes don&#x2019;t match with the draconians. The chances are slim that I will become the demon king when I am already falling behind in individual ability. It is better to stay still than to get involved in a struggle between factions.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">That wasn&#x2019;t all; the lycanthropes had a political weakness.&#xA0;</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">The existence of Caitlin Moonlight and the secret of her birth...</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">She was the reason why the lycanthropes didn&#x2019;t get involved in the politics of the Demon King&#x2019;s castle. Chris and Caitlin had proven they weren&#x2019;t interested in the throne by living at the palace of the lycanthropes instead of the Demon King&#x2019;s Palace.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Perhaps it was for Caitlin to some extent. Just like Shutra in the past, interest would be diminished once the person was out of sight.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;However, Shutra is different. You can catch up with 1st Prince and 2nd Prince.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Chris&#x2019; blue eyes shone with eagerness. He sincerely believed that In-gong could surpass Baikal and Zephyr.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Only a few months after learning Aura, he had reached a level comparable to Caitlin. He had combined Divine Beast Authority and Sura Heart Law to create Divine Sura Authority and brought out the true efficacy of the Moonlight Extract.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Calling him a genius was lacking. He was a monster comparable to Zephyr, even the sword duke had expressed it.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;You can also get support from those other than the lycanthropes, unlike me.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">The sword duke was already supporting him. There wasn&#x2019;t an official station, but the fact that the sword duke had taught him personally wasn&#x2019;t small.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;The dark elves are currently neutral. It was likely that they would have leaned towards the 4th Princess as time passed by, but you appeared. You captured Felicia&#x2019;s heart completely in just a few months.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Silvan and Felicia were like Chris and Caitlin. The moment he got Felicia&#x2019;s heart, he also got Silvan&#x2019;s.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">In-gong was somewhat uncomfortable with the statement that he had gained Felicia&#x2019;s heart, but he couldn&#x2019;t deny it. It was unimaginable that Felicia would side with any of the other royal children over In-gong.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;The sponsorship of the sword duke. If you keep stacking up merits, you can pardon the gandharva who are now confined. Although they are in a state of collapse, they were a species that had once been able to build up a queen. Their power can&#x2019;t be ignored.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">In-gong felt like he had been slapped in the back of the head.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Confined? Pardon?</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Was that why he hadn&#x2019;t even seen one gandharva?&#xA0;</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">What sin had been committed that the whole species had been confined?</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">This story seemed correct. It was the reason why there weren&#x2019;t any gandharva caring for Shutra.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">If so, what had they done? When looking at the discussion of amnesty through merits, what type of crime could it be that, despite the crime, Shutra and the 5th Queen still maintained their status?</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">He had plenty of doubts. He needed to find out about the gandharva.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Chris sighed and took a sip of water from the glass on the table as though his throat was burning.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;I don&#x2019;t like 1st Prince, 2nd Prince and 4th Princess. But Shutra is different. I think the future where you become demon king is best for the lycanthrope species.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">It wasn&#x2019;t simply because they were friends.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">There was already a trusting and supportive relationship between In-gong and the lycanthropes after learning Divine Beast Authority.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">In-gong also had none of his mother&#x2019;s family to rely on, so allying with the lycanthropes was beneficial to him.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Chris suddenly grinned. His face reverted to his usual friendly expression as he spoke,</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Well, you don&#x2019;t have to do anything right now. Just think about it. There is a big difference between thinking of it yourself and having someone suggest it to you.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Chris winked slightly and got up from his seat. Like Elaine, he approached Caitlin. He touched Caitlin, who was sleeping serenely, on the cheek and kissed her forehead.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Think about Mother&#x2019;s words.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Chris said as he looked up and In-gong was reminded of Elaine.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">They had the same eyes. Moreover, why was he looking this way after kissing Caitlin? There were many guesses and assumptions.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Just a little bit longer. If you are hungry or if Caitlin wakes up, pull the line on this wall.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Chris instructed in a friendly tone before stepping out of the room. In-gong laughed for some unknown reason.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&apos;Becoming the demon king.&#x2019;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Chris&#x2019; words were all true.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">At first, In-gong had also been similar to Chris. In-gong hadn&#x2019;t thought that he would become the demon king.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">However, things had changed. In some ways, it could have been decided from the beginning.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Zephyr was the strongest royal child. It was natural that someone stronger than Zephyr would become the demon king.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x2018;It is like a mother having a friend&#x2019;s son who was the best, but she wants her son to become first in the nation.&apos;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">In-gong laughed at the analogy he came up with and nodded slowly.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">His thoughts were simple. The advice was precious, but he had already come to a conclusion.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x2018;Become strong.&#x2019; Everything would be resolved if he became strong enough to be the demon king.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">He would be able to stop the destruction of the lycanthropes and the Day of Massacre.
