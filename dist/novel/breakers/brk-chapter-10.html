They were born with strong vitality and showed remarkable ability to resist time. Additionally, those with the blood of the wild were ruthless, persistent and excellent hunters.</p><p>The lycanthropes were breathing harshly.</p><p>Their appearances varied and they could pass off as wolves, tigers, and so on.</p><p>They weren&#x2019;t breathing hard because they were exhausted. It was to control the wild blood that had awakened.</p><p>The smell of the Red Lightning tribe&#x2019;s blood stimulated the lycanthropes. Some lost control and bit the bodies of the orcs.</p><p>Among the lycanthropes, there was one who was different.</p><p>It was a female with dark blue hair tied up and bloodied black leather armour.</p><p>Caitlin Moonlight.</p><p>The eighth princess and lycanthrope was controlling her breathing with closed eyes.</p><p>As a half lycanthrope and half sura, she was unlike the other lycanthropes. However, none of the lycanthropes dared to ignore her.</p><p>After breathing for a long time, Caitlin finally opened her eyes. She sniffed as she looked around and frowned.</p><p>&apos;I missed him.&#x2019;</p><p>She succeeded in smashing Kaichin&#x2019;s army but she missed killing Kaichin and Kaidum.</p><p>&apos;It can&apos;t be helped.&#x2019;</p><p>It was a melee and they were cowards who didn&#x2019;t fight properly.</p><p>&apos;Yes, it can&#x2019;t be helped.&#x2019;</p><p>She tried to convince herself but it didn&#x2019;t work. In the end, Caitlin kicked furiously at the ground.</p><p>&quot;Princess.&quot;</p><p>Caitlin turned around as someone called out to her.</p><p>&quot;Seira.&#x201D;</p><p>Caitlin&#x2019;s direct subordinate, the lycanthrope Seira, bowed. As a leopard lycanthrope, her golden hair was dyed red with the blood of enemies. Regardless, she was a stable subordinate.</p><p>&quot;Are you hurt anywhere?&#x201D;</p><p>Caitlin asked with a gentle smile.</p><p>&quot;I&#x2019;m fine, thank you for worrying. I have an urgent matter to report.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Huh? Report?&#x201D;</p><p>The battle was already over, so Caitlin didn&#x2019;t know what needed to be reported. Seira took one step closer to Caitlin.</p><p>&quot;Kaichin is dead. Kaidum, who was with him, also died.&#x201D;</p><p>It was good news but Caitlin used raised an eyebrow instead of feeling jubilant.</p><p>&#x201C;Who caught him?&#x201D;</p><p>They had run away just after the battle started. Were there soldiers tracking them after they left the battlefield?</p><p>In response to Caitlin&#x2019;s question, Seira coughed with an uncomfortable expression and replied,</p><p>&#x201C;Prince Shutra.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Huh?&#x201D;</p><p>Caitlin let out a sound reflexively. Shutra&#x2019;s name had suddenly come out.</p><p>Seira understood Caitlin&#x2019;s heart, so she continued with an awkward smile.</p><p>&quot;Prince Shutra caught Kaichin and Kaidum. He personally took down Kaidum.&#x201D;</p><p>Caitlin just stared blankly instead of replying. Seira understood her master&#x2019;s confusion.</p><p>&apos;I thought the same.&#x2019;</p><p>However, it was true.</p><p>The Ninth Prince Shutra Ignus.</p><p>The weakest prince had caught Kaichin and Kaidum and he achieved the best merits in today&#x2019;s battle.</p><p>&amp;</p><p>He received rewards for catching the enemy.</p><p>He had gained three levels and learnt the new skill, Telekinesis.</p><p>It was obviously a good thing. However, In-gong couldn&#x2019;t be comforted easily.</p><p>&apos;What is it?&#x2019;</p><p>That white woman he saw during the battle.</p><p>She wore white clothes and had a golden crown on her head. One of her eyes was red and the other blue. The woman had been unrealistically beautiful.</p><p>&#x2018;No, rather than being beautiful...she felt different?&#x2019;</p><p>Anyway, it was clear that she wasn&#x2019;t an ordinary person.</p><p>But who was she? She was someone who hadn&#x2019;t appear in Knight Saga.</p><p>&#x2018;Is she an important person who normally appears in moments of crisis?&#x2019;</p><p>Maybe she was the one who had brought In-gong into this world.</p><p>&apos;Punishment, obedience, governance.&#x2019;</p><p>The words he&#x2019;d heard from the woman surfaced in his head again.</p><p>In-gong activated both the status window and skills window. Both of them surfaced in front of him.</p><p>[Secondary Occupation: Conquest Knight Lv1]</p><p>[Conquer Lv1]</p><p>[Below the King&#x2019;s Flag Lv1)</p><p>The deactivated skill Conquest became Lv1 but like Protagonist Correction, he wasn&#x2019;t able to raise the level with skill points.</p><p>&#x2018;Conquest. Conquest Knight.&#x2019;</p><p>It was a skill and occupation that hadn&#x2019;t existed in Knight Saga.</p><p>&apos;Below the King&#x2019;s Flag is a buff skill... The power of conquest is the power of a king? Is that why the white woman is wearing a crown?&#x2019;</p><p>In-gong worried about it for a while before sighing, then concluded it neatly.</p><p>&#x2018;Ah, I don&#x2019;t know. If she is really important, I&#x2019;ll see her again later.&#x2019;</p><p>He wouldn&#x2019;t get any answers, so there was no point struggling alone. The information he had was too lacking in the first place.</p><p>&#x2018;If I go to the library, there might be stories related to this.&#x2019;</p><p>The library in the Demon King&#x2019;s Palace was managed by an elder lich. It contained a lot of information, so there might be something related to a Conquest Knight there.</p><p>&#x2018;In order to take advantage of that, I need to be strong.&#x2019;</p><p>It was a ridiculous rule in the Demon King&#x2019;s Palace and the Demon World.</p><p>Those who didn&#x2019;t reach a certain level of strength couldn&#x2019;t use some facilities in the palace and in the towns. A few more levels were required to use the magic laboratories or the blacksmiths.</p><p>The library needed a very high level. Even Zephyr hadn&#x2019;t been able to use the library in the early parts of the game.</p><p>&#x2018;It is good for now.&#x2019;</p><p>He was already level eight. It wasn&#x2019;t even half of Carack&#x2019;s level but it was significant since he had just barely stepped into this world.</p><p>&#x2018;Come to think of it.&#x2019;</p><p>In-gong had killed an orc with his own hands. However, he didn&#x2019;t feel any surge of emotions.</p><p>&apos;Uh, shouldn&#x2019;t I have a trauma by now?&#x2019;</p><p>Was In-gong a psychopath? No, there was no way. Anyway, it was in a battle and if he didn&#x2019;t kill the orc, his allies would have died.</p><p>&apos;And it was an orc.&#x2019;</p><p>He felt sorry towards Carack but he couldn&#x2019;t think of orcs as people yet. Their appearance was too different.</p><p>&#x201C;Prince.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Huh?&#x201D;</p><p>In-gong raised his head after hearing Carack&#x2019;s call. Carack looked at In-gong like he was crazy and pointed down the hill.</p><p>&quot;Someone is coming.&#x201D;</p><p>&quot;What?&quot;</p><p>He asked but there was no reply. In-gong checked to see who was coming from the bottom of the hill.</p><p>&#x2018;Caitlin?&#x2019;</p><p>He didn&#x2019;t have time to observe more closely. Caitlin quickly climbed the hill and moved next to In-gong.</p><p>&#x201C;Are you okay? Are you injured anywhere?&#x201D;</p><p>Caitlin asked while looking at In-gong&#x2019;s bloody clothes. Her voice was full of worry.</p><p>&#x201C;You... No, is Noona okay?&#x201D;</p><p>In-gong was more concerned about Caitlin. In-gong only had a little bit of blood on his clothes but Caitlin seemed like she had bathed in blood. Her blue hair was dyed dark from the blood.</p><p>Caitlin shrugged at In-gong&#x2019;s question and said,</p><p>&#x201C;It isn&#x2019;t my blood.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x2018;Wah, I never thought I would actually hear that line.&#x2019;</p><p>Caitlin took one step closer to In-gong while he was admiring her. She stared straight at In-gong and asked,</p><p>&quot;What happened?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;I will explain what happened.&#x201D;</p><p>In-gong summarised his experiences, making it as short as possible. During the reconnaissance, he had found a small path and an entrance to a cave. As he moved along the cave, he had arrived at the exit and encountered Kaichin&#x2019;s party.</p><p>&#x2018;I will leave out the part about finding dwarf weapons.&#x2019;</p><p>In-gong glanced nervously at his inventory button before looking back at Caitlin.</p><p>&#x2018;How will she respond?&apos;</p><p>Caitlin had been the confident one in yesterday&#x2019;s meeting. Maybe she had been kind to him because Shutra was too weak to be a threat.</p><p>However, now, Shutra, In-gong, had gotten the highest merit. He had also taken down one of the enemies with his own hands.</p><p>How would Caitlin respond?</p><p>Would she be wary? Would she treat him unkindly like Zephyr?</p><p>&#x201C;Amazing.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Huh?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;It is really amazing. You have made yourself distinguished!&#x201D;</p><p>It wasn&#x2019;t what he&#x2019;d expected. Caitlin laughed brightly. Her face was so pretty that it was the first time In-gong understood the phrase, &#x2018;flower bud blooming&#x2019;. He completely forgot that Caitlin was bloody.</p><p>Caitlin was different from yesterday. It was like she was truly delighted that her little brother had gotten some merits.</p><p>&#x2018;Kuk, I should be purified.&#x2019;</p><p>In-gong felt bad for thinking dark thoughts.</p><p>&#x2018;Zephyr aimed for someone like this? Indeed, Zephyr.&#x2019;</p><p>It was Zephyr who removed all threats by killing his siblings. It would be harder to be friendly to someone like that.</p><p>Anyway, In-gong had a question answered when he saw Caitlin laughing. She was similar but different from the white woman. They were both pretty, but Caitlin seemed like a person while the white woman hadn&#x2019;t.</p><p>&quot;You are much stronger than I thought. Cool, you&#x2019;re trustworthy.&#x201D;</p><p>Caitlin patted In-gong&#x2019;s shoulder. At that light touch, In-gong had another thought.</p><p>&#x2018;Didn&#x2019;t I awaken Telekinesis after being hit by it?&#x2019;</p><p>Unfortunately, In-gong didn&#x2019;t have any priests who knew how to use divine power. Neither did he have magicians who knew mana or aura users around.</p><p>However, now, Caitlin was in front of him.</p><p>&quot;Noona, I have a request.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Huh? A request? What is it?&#x201D;</p><p>She grinned like she was pleased to receive the request. In-gong said as naturally as possible.</p><p>&quot;Please hit me with a little bit of your aura.&#x201D;</p><p>It didn&#x2019;t take long for Caitlin&#x2019;s expression to change.</p><hr><p>Author&#x2019;s Note: the Four Knights of the Apocalypse.</p><p>White Knight of Conquest/ Red Knight of War/ Blue Knight of Death/ Black Knight of Famine.</p><p>See you tomorrow.</p><p>Today is a happy day. :D</p><p><br></p></div><p><br></p>
