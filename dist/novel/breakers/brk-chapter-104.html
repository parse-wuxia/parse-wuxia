She sighed and made a decision,</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;As you know, I&#x2019;m more like a civil servant rather than a military officer. So, instead of taking an area directly, I will take on the role of supporting 9th Prince and go to Evian.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Unlike her energetic personality, her voice was clear and calm.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Felicia finished speaking and glanced up at the demon king. The demon king didn&#x2019;t speak directly but nodded to give permission to Felicia.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Felicia had never heard her name being called, but she was satisfied about that small exchange with the demon king. Stealthily, she pressed a hand against her chest to check her heart.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Chris looked at Felicia. She noticed Chris&#x2019; gaze and the two people exchanged glances that showed their intentions.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Silvan&#x2019;s present condition wasn&#x2019;t that good, so Felicia wanted to embrace and comfort him.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">However, she couldn&#x2019;t do so because this was the court gathering. While thinking about this, Felicia stepped back.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Silvan would recover soon. So, she should think about something else and not about sticking to Silvan.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Felicia didn&#x2019;t follow In-gong because she wanted to work with him.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Of course, she wanted such a thing inside her heart, but that wasn&#x2019;t the main reason.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Due to the return of the group and the sword duke&#x2019;s intervention, In-gong hadn&#x2019;t made a declaration, but he was recognized as the leader of the fourth faction.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">In-gong needed support. Putting aside combat power, Felicia and Chris were the only ones able to assist In-gong in the political field.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">However, Chris was a warrior. It was unnatural to say he would go with In-gong when he had a combat power comparable to Silvan&#x2019;s. That would be an excessive waste of combat power and the Demon King&#x2019;s Palace wouldn&#x2019;t accept it.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">She didn&#x2019;t know why In-gong had picked Evian, but she would follow him. After all, they had been together since the Red Lightning Tribe.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">After Felicia made her decision, knowing gazes were passed between the people gathered in the hall. It was widely known that Felicia had decided to help In-gong.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;From now on, the selection order will be decided based on the merits accumulated in the Merits Department. 2nd Prince, please make a selection.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Isabella gazed at Zephyr with gentle eyes. Zephyr then gazed at Evian for a moment, then turned toward the north.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;I will go to Haragal.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Many people nodded calmly at the 2nd Prince&#x2019;s declaration.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Haragal was as close to the Northern Limit Line as possible and was regularly attacked by violent creatures. Haragal&#x2019;s degree of difficulty was higher than Evian&#x2019;s, never lower.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Of course, nobody could be sure that there would be an actual attack on the area predicted by the Demon King&#x2019;s Palace or even about the scale of the enemies that would appear.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">However, from the outset, Haragal was an important land. Haragal&#x2019;s land itself wasn&#x2019;t rich, but there were abundant resources underground including the papunil, that was called the vein of the Demon World.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Haragal was the shield that protected the papunil.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">So, 2nd Prince&#x2019;s choice was expected. If there truly was an attack, then it was the area where the greatest merits could be gained.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x2018;It is the next best thing since Zephyr was looking at Evian earlier.&#x2019;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Since In-gong had first opened his eyes in Carack&#x2019;s barracks, he had been good at reading things.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">When In-gong selected Evian, Zephyr clearly had a different reaction from usual. It was difficult to explain, but In-gong was able to sense it.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Zephyr seemed to be pursuing Evian as well.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">If so, why? When looked at objectively, Evian wasn&#x2019;t a good choice.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x2018;General Vandal.&#x2019;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">The name surfaced reflexively, but In-gong was certain. So, it was good that he sensed it.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Zephyr also seemed to be looking to bring in General Vandal.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">In Knight Saga, Zephyr had been able to defeat Vandal at the end of his second year, Year 514. However, that had been in Knight Saga.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">It was estimated that this Zephyr was much stronger than the Zephyr of Knight Saga. So, it was possible for the current Zephyr to beat Vandal.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">As an adult, Zephyr was able to move freely and choose his own missions just like Silvan and Felicia. However, it wasn&#x2019;t possible for him to meet with military personnel any time he wanted.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">So, maybe Zephyr thought about using this situation as an opportunity.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x2018;It is quite plausible. Then shouldn&#x2019;t I hurry and get Nayatra and Sektum as well?&#x2019;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">They had been his three favourite subordinates in Knight Saga.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Succubus Knight Nayatra, the Worst Necromancer Sektum and the Ogre Warrior Vandal...</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x2018;I have to hurry and visit the slave auction house where Nayatra is. It is necessary to secure Nayatra before securing Sektum.&#x2019;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Caitlin&#x2019;s birth secret had been the beginning of the lycanthrope subjugation.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">The one who had obtained this information had been Nayatra. There was no guarantee that she would get the information, but he had to block Zephyr from acquiring her.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">While In-gong was thinking, 1st Prince Baikal made his choice. Baikal also made a sensible choice.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Next, 4th Princess Anastasia made her decision. Her choice didn&#x2019;t overlap with In-gong&#x2019;s, Zephyr&#x2019;s or Baikal&#x2019;s.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">3rd Prince Victor chose to support Anastasia and the demon king allowed it.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">From In-gong to Anastasia, the leaders of each faction chose different areas and there were now only two areas left unselected.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;5th Prince, please make your selection.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Silvan jumped at Isabella&#x2019;s call and chose a place close to Evian. &#xA0;As there had been no abnormality when In-gong, Zephyr and the others made the selections, he had managed to restore most of his composure.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Now, there was only one area left and Chris and Caitlin, the siblings, had the opportunity to choose.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Everyone thought they knew what the lycanthrope siblings would choose, so they thought there would be nothing else worth seeing.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Chris would choose the remaining area and Caitlin would follow.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">It wasn&#x2019;t a bad thing. This was a good but reasonable choice.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">However, Chris just laughed and exchanged glances with Caitlin who nodded.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;I will go to Kaltu.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Chris said the name of the remaining area.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">The selections were now as good as over. Isabella turned to Caitlin with a gentle expression.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;8th Princess, please make your selection.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;I will go to Evian.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;I understand. Evian... huh?&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Isabella cried out involuntarily. Gellahed, who was standing with the other captains, also looked at Caitlin with confused eyes.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Caitlin took a deep breath and spoke calmly,</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;9th Prince Shutra is still young compared to the other princes and princesses. 6th Princess is helping, but 6th Princess is a scholar and not a warrior. I am inexperienced as well, but I am a warrior. So, I think I would make a decent balance with 9th Prince and 6th Princess.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Her words were reasonable.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">9th Prince had only started to stand out a few months ago.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Moreover, the Demon King&#x2019;s Palace didn&#x2019;t yet know In-gong&#x2019;s real strength, so they didn&#x2019;t think he would be stronger than Caitlin.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Isabella, who thought Caitlin was going to follow Chris, looked at the demon king with a puzzled faced. The demon king nodded again to express his permission.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">It was a reasonable decision. From the beginning, the Demon King&#x2019;s Palace had thought Caitlin would go with Chris. However, Chris was much stronger than In-gong. So, there was no reason to refuse to let her accompany In-gong when they would have allowed her to accompany Chris.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;You have completed your area selections. Princes and Princesses, five days from today, you will start moving to each area. The information regarding the purple aura enemies will be sent to your homes.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Thus, the main agenda of the court gathering was over. As usual, there were a few ceremonial events to end the court gathering.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">In-gong took a deep breath and looked around. The sword duke was smiling with an unknown expression while the demon king was as expressionless as always.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Gallehed was gazing at Caitlin with worry, while Yecaderina, the nightmares captain, was giving a lovely smile.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">As for Richard...</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">The leader of the draconians and one of the strongest captains aside from Gallehed&#x2014;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">He had been In-gong&#x2019;s strongest ally when In-gong played Zephyr. However, at this moment, Richard was looking down at In-gong with a ferocious smile. In-gong ignored Richard&#x2019;s gaze and turned to Zephyr.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">At that moment, Zephyr turned his gaze to In-gong as though he had been waiting for it and their gazes met in midair.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&amp;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;I&#x2019;m tired, tired, tired!&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">As soon as they returned to the waiting room, Felicia threw herself onto a large sofa and screamed.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Although it was far from polite, the people in the waiting room were all close to Felicia, so there was no need for politeness.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Felicia waved her arms and legs and kept sighing.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Ah, the sword duke is a fool. A person like that isn&#x2019;t good for my heart. He should tell us in advance.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">It had been a few days since the group had arrived at the Demon King&#x2019;s Palace. It would have been nice if he sent a simple message during that time. Despite that, he still insisted on surprising them today.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;S-sword Duke.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Silvan sat down next to Felicia and clutched his chest. Felicia felt sorry for Silvan and hugged him tightly.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;My poor Silvan.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">He really wanted to become the sword duke&#x2019;s disciple.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">As Felicia patted Silvan&#x2019;s back with gentle eyes, Chris turned his gaze to In-gong and said in a lively voice,</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Anyway, his actions were helpful. At today&#x2019;s court gathering, the sword duke practically announced that he is supporting Shutra. By the way, it is strange. How did you manage to catch the sword duke&#x2019;s heart? What is the secret? I want to learn how to do it.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Silvan&#x2019;s eyes flashed as he also wanted to learn the secret. In-gong just grinned awkwardly and replied,</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;I don&#x2019;t know.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">The sword duke&#x2019;s favor derived from In-gong&#x2019;s uniqueness and the demon king&#x2019;s interest. So, the other princes wouldn&#x2019;t be able to apply to this.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Felicia, who was still hugging Silvan, asked Chris suddenly,</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Chris, is it okay for Caitlin to not go with you?&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Felicia was also surprised when Caitlin said she would go with In-gong instead of Chris.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Chris replied with a shrug,</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;It is bittersweet, but it will be more helpful than if she stays with me. It seems like the performance of the Moonlight Core and Starlight Core is better than expected.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">It had only been about 10 days or so, but In-gong and Caitlin had shown a huge growth in their aura over the last 10 days. The synergy between the Moonlight Core and Starlight Core was truly amazing.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Chris patted Caitlin&#x2019;s head and asked,</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Caitlin, unlike Spider Forest, this might be a moderately long mission. Is that okay?&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Yes, it is okay.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Unlike the time at the lycanthrope house, Caitlin answered with a bright smile. There was no unease at all.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Really bittersweet.&quot;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Chris complained with slumped shoulders and Felicia laughed. She was still holding onto Silvan when she said,</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Well, today&#x2019;s work is over. The enemies with the purple aura, the sword duke... There are many things to talk about, but I want to rest for a while. Isn&#x2019;t that right, Silvan?&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;Hu... Sword Duke.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Silvan nodded reflexively. At that moment...</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Huh? Did you call me?&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">The sword duke&#x2019;s voice was heard from behind them. Startled, Felicia jumped up from her seat and looked back.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;S-sword Duke?&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">It truly was the sword duke. He laughed from the door of the waiting room, then he pinched Felicia&#x2019;s cheeks.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;This princess is still a baby. Aigoo, so cute.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Felicia&#x2019;s face was red while Silvan was stunned. The sword duke laughed and moved on.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;Ohh, 8th Princess. You are much bigger up close. I have to try it once.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;Huh? Kyak?!&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">There was no time to reply. Just like he had done to Felicia at Thunderdoom Fortress, he placed his hands between Caitlin&#x2019;s arms and raised her up high.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Higher, higher!&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">As if he was playing with a little child, he kept spinning Caitlin.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">At Thunderdoom Fortress, Felicia had screamed to be put down, but Caitlin was different. At first, she was panicked, but then she started to enjoy it. If she was to speak, she would say how amazing it was.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Well, this is still fun. So adorable.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">The word truly fit Caitlin who had red cheeks and sparkling eyes.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">After greeting Felicia and Caitlin, the sword duke turned toward In-gong. In-gong regained his composure and spoke calmly,</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;I greet the sword duke.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;I greet you as well. 5th Prince and 7th Prince too, it is a pleasure.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;Greetings.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;G-greetings.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Chris and Silvan greeted him as well. Chris was a little wary of the sword duke, while Silvan seemed eager to talk to him.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">However, the first one to say something wasn&#x2019;t a prince or princess.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;Look, what happened all of a sudden?&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">It was Carack who asked.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Silvan was astonished while Chris flinched.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Carack had just casually asked the sword duke a question.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">However, Felicia had already adapted to Carack, while Delia, Seira and Sepira just admired Carack&#x2019;s boldness.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">The sword duke just laughed pleasantly like he had at Thunderdoom Fortress and said to In-gong,</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;I came to ask 9th Prince something. There is a story I would like to share, but I also have a request.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;A request?&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Yes. I can only ask Prince.&quot;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">The sword duke said with a laugh. There was mischief in his eyes, similar to when he played with Felicia and Caitlin.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Can Prince invite me to your mansion? I want to see that person.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&amp;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Ya, ya! Stay away! Don&#x2019;t tease me! Why the hell did you bring this brat? I decided we&#x2019;re to keep it a secret! This is a breach of contract!&#x201D;</span></p><hr><p></p><p></p></div><p></p>
