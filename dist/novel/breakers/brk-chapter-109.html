Then the appearance of a big bookshelf popped into his head.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">There was a total of five books. Compared to the large bookcase, the number of books was embarrassingly small, but In-gong didn&#x2019;t care. Anyway, it was a bookcase that no one else could see.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">All five books described the elder dragons. They were the books he had borrowed from the library and read once.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">He thought about one of them, then the part he wanted automatically came up in his head. It was vivid as though he had photographed the book.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">It wasn&#x2019;t the so-called &#x2018;photographic memory&#x2019; ability. It was a little bit different, but the end result was similar.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">In-gong had &#x2018;conquered&#x2019; the books he borrowed from the library.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Thanks to that, he could recall them any time he wanted.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x2018;I read all of it roughly, but... it really is a fraudulent skill.&#x2019;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">A Conquest Knight could conquer and dominate all things. This applied to books as well as techniques, so he was eager to test out the applications.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">What else could he conquer? Could he apply the power of Conquest to everything?</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">However, first, it was time to look at his memories.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">The five books in the library varied from simple storybooks to history books. Each had a different story about the elder dragons, and according to the books, there were many more stories not present.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">However, there was one thing they had in common.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">In-gong simultaneously recalled different pages of the five books.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">The disappearance of the elder dragons...</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">The Great Enkidu, who had lived in the Jishuka Mountains, had suddenly left his treasures and dungeon for another place.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">It had occurred approximately 1,000 years ago. One of the dwarf keepers had left a record of this behind.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">The time when Violent Kaltein had last been seen was also similar. It couldn&#x2019;t be guessed precisely as to when because the record left behind by the dwarf and the storybook were created at different times, but it was close to 1,000 years ago.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">There were no records related to Watcher Ainkel, but because of Green Wind, In-gong knew that Watcher Ainkel had been murdered 1,000 years ago.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">The rest of the elder dragons were in similar situations. The witness reports, such as for the Brutal Talia, were cut off long ago, and it was important that they hadn&#x2019;t appeared anywhere in the last 1,000 years.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&apos;The only exception is Guardian Queian.&#x2019;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">There were no records found in the books of the library, but In-gong knew about him thanks to Knight Saga&#x2019;s setting.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">During the past 1,000 years, Guardian Queian had acted several times in the Human World.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Five of the six elder dragons had disappeared from this world 1,000 years ago.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Watcher Ainkel had been killed and Violent Kaltein&#x2019;s dungeon had been violently destroyed by someone.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">If so, perhaps the others were the same. There had probably been a big fight 1,000 years ago that wasn&#x2019;t revealed on the surface of the history records.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">The Four Knights of the Apocalypse...</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">And the four people who selected them&#x2014;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">In-gong recalled some information that might be helpful in the present situation.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x2018;Guardian Queian&#x2019;s lair is hard to pass through... but is it possible to guess the location of the Brutal Talia?&#x2019;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">If he looked at the places where the elder dragons&#x2019; legends were based, he could guess the locations of their lairs.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">The records of Brutal Talia were concentrated in the northern cold zone.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Considering that Talia had the power of the cold, it was an interesting combination.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&apos;It isn&#x2019;t too far right now... My next target should be obtaining Talia&#x2019;s equipment.&#x2019;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Queian&#x2019;s lair was in the human world, while the lair of the last elder dragon, Record Keeper Torres, was hard to pinpoint due to the records talking about the entire Demon World.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">After he finished thinking about the elder dragons, In-gong put away the virtual books and opened his eyes.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Even without his sight, he could tell the location just through hearing and scent. In-gong was in the middle of a grassland with dry wind.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Just like Thunderdoom Fortress, Evian didn&#x2019;t have a transportation formation, so he had to move to the closest area with one.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">As always, there was a guide at the transportation formation. Fortunately, this one was a man. The party and their supplies moved on carriages towards Evian.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">One day after their departure...</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">In-gong was riding Maybach, whom he had not seen in a long time. White aura and green magic power were tangled together and rotating in each of his hand.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x2018;Okay.&#x2019;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Even while he had his eyes closed and mind occupied with other thoughts, In-gong could operate aura and magic power as naturally as breathing.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Moreover, it was not simply operating; the aura and magic power in front of him were pushing at each other and creating a synergistic effect.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">When using Gigantic Piston and Dragon&#x2019;s Bane, he had been unconsciously using aura and magic power simultaneously.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">In-gong didn&#x2019;t use mana for specific skills but added magic power to the aura itself.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">The result was successful. All actions that used aura, as well as Divine Sura Authority, had become faster and stronger.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x2018;It is a pity that I didn&#x2019;t meet the sword duke again.&#x2019;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">The sword duke had promised to meet again during his stay at the Demon King&#x2019;s Palace, but he unfortunately had to leave the next day.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">He didn&#x2019;t know any of the details, but it seemed like the sword duke needed to leave in a hurry.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">The demon king had mentioned the sanctuary.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Perhaps there was something wrong with the sanctuary that the sura were guarding.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;Shutra.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;Huh?&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">He had thought he was alone when he heard a voice next to him. In-gong looked around to see Caitlin approaching him on a stunning black horse.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Caitlin looked down at In-gong&#x2019;s hands and asked,</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;That&#x2014; What are you doing? Are you operating aura and magic power at the same time?&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;Yes.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Caitlin&#x2019;s golden eyes lit up at In-gong&#x2019;s answer. She mumbled, &#x201C;Amazing&#x201D; a few times, then asked again with an excited face,</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Shutra, do you have any tips?&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Originally, aura and magic power would push against each other.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">In-gong shrugged at Caitlin&#x2019;s question.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;There is no such thing... I just do it.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">In-gong&#x2019;s words were unfortunate, but it couldn&#x2019;t be helped. He really just did it.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Caitlin frowned at In-gong&#x2019;s answer, then closed her eyes and activated her aura. Caitlin&#x2019;s blue aura and white magic power gathered on her right hand, but both of them disappeared instead of tangling together like In-gong&#x2019;s.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Aura interfered with the operation of magic power while magic power destroyed the aura&#x2019;s flow.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">After several more attempts, Caitlin sighed and opened her eyes. She stared at In-gong and grumbled,</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;Shutra is too much.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;What?&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;Too much.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Her grouchy expression was cute. In-gong tried to stop his laughter, but it was inevitable that a small smil formed.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">On In-gong&#x2019;s other side, a new voice was added,</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;That&#x2019;s right, Shutra is too much.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">It was Felicia who was riding on a draco. As In-gong looked back, the voices continued,</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Right, too much.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Way too much! Too much! It is too much!&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">The last voice belonged to Amita who was riding on a horse with Daphne. Daphne became confused as the waving tail hit the horse.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">He could understand why Amita was upset, but why was Felicia&#x2014; no, Carack upset as well?</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x2018;Shouldn&#x2019;t I be the one saying that Carack is too much?&#x2019;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">In-gong looked at Delia, Seira and Karma who were beside Carack, then he looked back at Carack. It was because he suddenly had an ominous premonition.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x2018;Surely, Nayatra won&#x2019;t like Carack as well?&#x2019;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">He felt anxious. Despite there being no basis for this,, he couldn&#x2019;t help the ominous feeling.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">In fact, he didn&#x2019;t even know why Seira, Delia and Sepira had started liking Carack in the first place. It seemed like he was a aide killer.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x2018;N-no. Nayatra can&#x2019;t be the same.&#x2019;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">It wasn&#x2019;t an exaggeration to say that Locke had a harem around him, however, Zephyr was different due to his grim nature. Therefore, his only hope in the Demon World was Nayatra, who was like a flower blooming in a desert.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">While thinking about Nayatra, In-gong was reminded of something... There was one more problem.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x2018;What excuse can I use to go to the auction?&#x2019;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">If he were alone, then he would just go with Carack. However, right now, In-gong wasn&#x2019;t alone. In order to avoid Caitlin&#x2019;s and Felicia&#x2019;s cold eyes, he needed a good reason to visit Takar&#x2019;s slave auction house.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x2018;Well, there are a lot of assets to process right now.&#x2019;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">There were the goods from the dungeon and the ruin.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Even the dwarf weapons that he found in the dwarf cave hadn&#x2019;t been processed yet. This was a chance to obtain Nayatra, but he should also use it to organize his things.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x2018;Slaves aren&#x2019;t the only things sold at the auction house.&#x2019;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">There were various types of artifacts as well as various magic tools that could be used in battle.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">There were valuable ingredients like elixirs and dragon hearts that could luckily be obtained if they had enough money.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">In-gong looked at Carack&#x2019;s shield for a moment. Thanks to Amita joining them, the party could receive the best equipment, but it was still lacking. Right now, Carack was the only one who had received a shield from Amita. Weapons were still needed.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x2018;Moreover...&#x2019;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">The materials that Amita could use currently were the leather, bones and scales from the black dragon and the sea serpent. Both were top quality materials, but there wasn&#x2019;t a variety of material.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">If a variety of material were added, then Amita would be able to produce better and more unconventional equipment.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">In-gong looked at Amita who started trembling. They felt something like a ominous feeling.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x2018;I should go to the auction house to liquidate the assets and see if there are any good items.&#x2019;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Just thinking about it convinced In-gong, and he nodded with a cheerful expression. Meanwhile, Caitlin was grouchy as she tried to join aura and magic power together a few more times.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">As In-gong was thinking about how to comfort her...</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&apos;Master, a group of people are approaching from the front.&#x2019;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Green Wind&#x2019;s voice entered his ears, and In-gong focused aura on his eyes. As Green Wind had said, a group of people were rushing towards them from far away.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&amp;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;I just need to stop them here.&#x201D;</span></p><p></p><p></p></div><p></p>
