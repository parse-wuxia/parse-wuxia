Moreover, the higher the magician&#x2019;s level was, the greater the gap would be. In severe cases, there were times when the attack power differed by dozens of times.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Felicia was a competent magician and she had half a day to prepare. Furthermore, this was a limited area, so it was probably the best battlefield she had ever experienced with In-gong.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">However, it wasn&#x2019;t one strong opponent; there were numerous mobs.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Felicia had picked up a magic wand from Amita that could sense magic. As the night started, the power of the spirits were strengthened and illusions surrounded her. However, she had prepared her magic well.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">She noticed the world through the magic spells as well as her five senses and opened her eyes, showing her great magical powers to the world!</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt"><em>Kwakwakwang!</em></span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Thunder and lightning struck down loudly. The crazy bear at the front was struck by the lightning, burning the bear&#x2019;s brain in an instant. As the lightning reached toward its next goal, it grew exponentially and fell from the sky, striking nearly 30 beasts and monsters.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Once the monsters in the lead fell down, the others naturally rushed over them. They ran over the corpses of the monsters, but Felicia didn&#x2019;t allow them to approach either. Following the lightning bolts, gigantic flames stretched out towards the monsters.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">The fire didn&#x2019;t burn the forest easily. Furthermore, the flames were controlled by wind spirits. Instead, the wrath of the flames swept through the monsters and despite being out of their minds, they had a terrible feeling.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">However, as Amita had warned, there was an overwhelming number of monsters. Despite the fact that dozens had died in an instant, the seemingly endless procession of red dots on the mini-map never ceased.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">The monsters trampled on the corpses and passed through the flames. Additionally, there were those who trampled through the forest and used illusions to create new paths.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">However, Felicia didn&#x2019;t panic. She still had a few magic spells prepared.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Due to the ground being spread widely with Grease, it had become more slippery. The momentum of the monsters was great, so many of them tumbled down. As they fell to the ground in rapid succession, some of them fell on their heads and broke their necks. There were also monsters who were trampled by those behind them.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Moreover, there were additional traps in the earth. Then once again, lightning bolts swept through the monsters.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">A few minutes after the battle had begun, more than 100 monsters were screaming in front of the party.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Carack was wide-eyed and could barely suppress his urge to look back, while Seira&#x2019;s mouth was wide open and Delia had a warm smile on her face.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">The 6th Princess, Felicia Doomblade...</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">She was also a child of the demon king and a strong existence!</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt"><em>Kwakakakakang!</em></span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">A series of rapid explosions occurred in front of them. They were the result of the last magic trap Felicia had prepared.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Next!&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Felicia shouted and In-gong and Caitlin formed fists. They rushed towards the approaching monsters.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">The massive trail of bodies Felicia had created was now part of the terrain, hindering the monsters&#x2019; path and limiting their attack route.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">In-gong and Caitlin were blocking their way as well. There was no longer in physical contact with each other, but they still had a connection. The white aura and blue aura stretched out in a thin line like they were holding hands.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">In-gong breathed in deeply, then focused his attention on a wolf-like monster running at the front of the mob.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Protagonist Body.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">The growing rate of all skills he had learnt was accelerated.&#xA0;</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">In-gong was growing during the battle, just as he had grown in every battle he had fought so far.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Up to now, his movements had been the same. Then he gained some new knowledge. He hadn&#x2019;t known his body had been moving that way until it actually happened.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">He didn&#x2019;t explode his aura; he simply manipulated it.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">It wasn&#x2019;t the same as before. The explosive power of his aura had actually become stronger.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">That&#x2019;s how it was. This was the technique used and it had been created with a simple principle.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">[The level of Explosive Power has risen.]</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">[The level of Lightning has risen.]</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">[The level of Great Mountain has risen.]</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">His skill proficiency increased suddenly due to the increase of his technical understanding. This was because gaining enlightenment had the same value as training dozens of times.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">In-gong felt pleased, but it wasn&#x2019;t the kind of joy that came from destroying an enemy.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">It was due to experiencing growth.&#xA0;</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">He was polishing off his techniques.&#xA0;</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">This was the joy of strengthening himself.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">In-gong could feel Caitlin&#x2019;s emotions and that she was also pleased. The two of them shared this joy as their auras moved. Then while moving around, they defended each other&#x2019;s backs.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">It was like a swirl &#x2014; a style that caught and crushed everything.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">As In-gong remembered his clumsy posture when Carack first made him hold a sword, he laughed. Seira, who knew Caitlin&#x2019;s usual disposition, also had wide eyes from joy and confusion.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Both of In-gong and Caitlin had strengthened noticeably and their team work was comparable to Caitlin&#x2019;s team work with Chris, who she had been moving together with for a long time. No, maybe it was even more than that.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;Kuraha!&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Carack let out a battle cry suddenly. Seira then looked at him and he laughed as he lifted the axe he had received from Amita. It was a fearsome magic weapon that unleashed a thunderbolt every time he wielded it.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Seira understood what Carack meant; it wasn&#x2019;t the time to stand there with admiration. She felt humiliated by losing sight of her role as an aide, but she also liked Carack&#x2019;s trustworthiness. Then in an instant, the blond beauty turned into a fearsome leopard.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Carack, Seira, In-gong and Caitlin went on to deal with the monsters. The process leading from here was difficult and it seemed like the number of monsters weren&#x2019;t decreasing.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">As Daphne used recovery magic and support magic on those fighting, she turned to Amita. Instead of laughing or being filled with admiration, Amita was staring at In-gong and Caitlin with serious eyes. They then whispered in a low voice,</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;I want to make it.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Daphne&#x2019;s eyes widened while Amita continued to speak,</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;I also need to tune it. It isn&#x2019;t completely suitable for him.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">The equipment from the elder dragons certainly had great performance, but there was a lot of room for improvement as it didn&#x2019;t fit In-gong completely.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;Amita?&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Daphne called out to Amita with a large grin as she understood the intentions in their small voice.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Amita looked up at the laughing Daphne. They hit the ground with their tail and burst out,</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Well, that is a story for when this is over.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Once this is over, I will also expect you to make equipment for me.&quot;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Instead of replying, Amita just laughed at Daphne.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Meanwhile, Felicia chanted new magic spells to help In-gong and Caitlin who were fighting.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Some time passed...</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">In-gong, who was in a battle trance, stopped moving his hands and feet. Yesterday, he had dealt with nearly a hundred monsters, yet his level hadn&#x2019;t risen.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">However, In-gong hadn&#x2019;t stopped in order to confirm his experience. It was because the endless procession of monsters had finally stopped.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">He looked at the mini-map and saw that there were hardly any red dots. Caitlin stopped moving as well and exhaled, while Carack and Seira stretched their arms like they were very tired.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;The white giant is appearing! Come back inside the ward!&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Amita shouted loudly. In-gong and Caitlin hurried into the ward with Carack and Seira following behind them. As soon as the four people came back, Amita closed the hole they had intentionally left in the ward and made it complete.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;Is it over now?&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Felicia asked as she flopped on the ground. It wasn&#x2019;t an exaggeration to say that her whole body was covered in sweat.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Amita nodded.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Yes. Now, we just have to wait. There will be some impact when the giant taps on the ward, but it won&#x2019;t be a problem. Good work, everyone.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">All of them tilted their heads to look up at the sky. Under the green moon, the white giant emerged from the ground.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">The giant was right in front of them and before the enormity of the giant, Felicia swallowed her saliva and Daphne felt an instinctive fear.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">The giant reached out into the air. A transparent wall was blocking it, so it appeared as though it was miming.&#xA0;</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">This was a repeat of yesterday as it hit the air with its palm and fists.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">The party blocked their eyes or lowered their posture to prepare for the shock.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">However, In-gong didn&#x2019;t. He saw the blue aura coming from the white light of the giant&#x2019;s body and cried out,</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;It is different from yesterday!&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;Shutra?&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Caitlin asked and In-gong concentrated. Astonishment was heard from behind them.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;The power of Death?&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Amita.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">In-gong looked back reflexively and saw Amita staring at the giant with a surprised expression. Daphne shrieked.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt"><em>Kwang!</em></span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">There was a roar as the whole warding barrier shook. It seemed to be a test as the giant took a few steps backwards. It stretched out both its hands and aimed at the wall with its palms, shooting out a pillar of blue power that contained the aura of Death!</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt"><em>Kwakakakang!</em></span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">A violent vibration, that couldn&#x2019;t be compared to the first time, hit the party. Carack caught Seira, who had lost her balance, and looked at In-gong urgently, but In-gong was staring at the sky. A crack had appeared in the night sky.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">However, the sky hadn&#x2019;t actually cracked; it was the ward that had cracked.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;Amita!&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Felicia shouted hurriedly toward Amita, but Amita didn&#x2019;t look at her. Amita was visibly perplexed.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt"><em>Kwang!</em></span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">A second blast shook the ward. The crack grew bigger and the scattered blue energy turned purple. As the blue light spread against the night sky, it took on a creepy appearance.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">The ward was on the verge of breaking and it was questionable how many more attacks it would be able to endure.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;We have to stop it.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">In-gong said out loud reflexively.&#xA0;</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">He didn&#x2019;t know how to deal with a 20-meter-tall giant, but he had to stop it.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">He was currently level 24.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">His level was lacking, but he just needed a little bit more experience. There may be a solution once he reached level 25.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">The white giant activated the blue aura once again. Daphne was still hugging Amita with bemusement while Carack and Caitlin were looking for ways to escape.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Then Caitlin pointed towards the sky.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;That... What is that?&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">The presence of the green moon and the white giant had been enough to capture everyone&#x2019;s eyes, but something remarkable could be seen in the starless night sky.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Something was approaching from between the green moon and the white giant. It was a silver light that grew bigger and bigger.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Instinctively, In-gong took out the Tears of a Dark Elf. The purple jewel had become lighter.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Similar to In-gong, she pulled out her necklace from where it had been buried in her cleavage. The necklace was also purple.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Felicia stood up instantly. The white giant&#x2019;s third bombardment struck the barrier and In-gong caught Felicia who had been about to fall. Felicia leaned on In-gong and stared at the cracked sky.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;A boat?&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Carack asked. Seira rubbed her eyes, thinking it was a apparition.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Just like Carack had said, it looked like a boat &#x2014; a gorgeous sailboat with silver sails.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Caitlin blinked. The white giant, who had been preparing for a fourth bombardment, looked at the boat.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Felicia was delighted by the sight. Meanwhile, Delia raised both hands and cheered.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">In-gong also recognized it.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">It was a ship sailing in the sky.&#xA0;</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">The tears of a dark elf...</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">The captain who was flying through the sky and the sword of a dark elf that pierced through it...!</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;Silvan!&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">It was Felicia&#x2019;s twin brother:</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">The fifth child of the demon king, 5th Prince Silvan Doomblade!</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Felicia called out to the sailboat moving across the night sky as it rammed into the heart of the white giant.</span></p><hr><p><br></p><p><br></p></div><p><br></p>
