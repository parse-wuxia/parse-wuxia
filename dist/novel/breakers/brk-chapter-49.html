It was common to have a considerable distance between both camps. In the meantime, there were soldiers in each camp. Therefore, it was difficult to have a long encounter with someone from the very beginning.</p><p>Most commanders avoided a one-on-one confrontation unless it was a special case. The role of a leader was to command the soldiers on the battlefield. A battlefield wouldn&#x2019;t end with just a single death. In the worst case scenario, the person would be killed in the battle itself.</p><p>&#x2018;That is a common war story.&#x2019;</p><p>However, Knight Saga was different. Commanders avoided one-on-one battles for these reasons, but In-gong knew of crucial variables.</p><p>These included aura, magic, psychic powers, divine powers and various physical abilities.</p><p>There were some commanders in Knight Saga with enough combat power to be a one man army.</p><p>It was the same for General Vandal and Chris and Caitlin of the lycanthropes.</p><p>&#x2018;Hitman unit.&#x2019;</p><p>They were independent troops that targeted enemy commanders on the battlefield.</p><p>The biggest reasons why Chris and Caitlin were called bloody monsters was because they managed the hitman units in very extreme ways.</p><p>It was through a sudden breakthrough. They crushed all the obstacles blocking their way and rushed in to kill the enemy.</p><p>Of course, Chris and Caitlin were the ones who usually acted as the hitman units.</p><p>In-gong&#x2019;s eyes were sharp. At this moment, he had to act similarly to the two of them.</p><p>&#x2018;I will do it in a more refined way.&#x2019;</p><p>The draco ran forward. It was the border of twilight and night, so the sky was red, yellow and dark.</p><p>In-gong glanced in front of him and at the mini-map.</p><p>The drake ogre he targeted was at the very front. There were drake ogres around him, but In-gong didn&#x2019;t need to cross an army to get to him.</p><p>&#x2018;Open the way.&#x2019;</p><p>He would then make a stage where a frontal confrontation was possible. He had already planned the method in his head.</p><p>&#x201C;Green Wind.&#x201D;</p><p>When he called her name, a soft light glowed from his chest. Green Wind&#x2019;s voice was heard in In-gong&#x2019;s head... No, the illusion of Green Wind stood next to In-gong. In-gong didn&#x2019;t explain but she understood his intent.</p><p>&quot;Son of Ainkel, I will follow you.&#x201D;</p><p>Leading the treants, this secondary part would be done by Green Wind.</p><p>In-gong reached out toward Green Wind. It was as natural as when he first got his hands on Enkidu&#x2019;s power.</p><p>&#x201C;Please cooperate.&#x201D;</p><p>Green Wind sighed like it couldn&#x2019;t be helped, then nodded with a smile that was reminiscent of Ainkel.</p><p>&#x201C;I will accept.&#x201D;</p><p>Green Wind didn&#x2019;t avoid In-gong&#x2019;s hands. Rather, she opened her arms and embraced In-gong.</p><p>The power of Conquest was triggered. Green Wind allowed it and temporarily went under In-gong&#x2019;s control.</p><p>Green Wind turned into light and wrapped around In-gong&#x2019;s arms and legs. The green light mixed in with the pure white aura, causing In-gong to feel the power of the wind coming from his body.</p><p>&#x201C;Open the path!&#x201D;</p><p>The command was passed on and the treants followed In-gong&#x2019;s command silently. In-gong manipulated the battlefield using the mini-map quickly and accurately.</p><p>The treants moved in unison to push the drake ogres out of the way. The drake ogre leader, who was wielding his scythe in a crazed manner, soon realized that he was on his own. There were still drake ogres and treants on the battlefield, but he was obviously alone.</p><p>Mustafa was the leader of the drake ogres. Instead of rushing toward the treants, he read the situation instinctively and noticed the significance of the open path.</p><p>A smile formed on Mustafa&#x2019;s goat-like face. Rather, he seemed to like this situation as he roared at In-gong.</p><p>It seemed to shake the entire battlefield. However, In-gong just smiled firmly at the war cry. Sweat was flowing down his back but he stared straight at Mustafa instead of running away.</p><p>&#x2018;You can do it. You will win, my temporary master.&#x2019;</p><p>Green Wind whispered. Despite the fact that a desperate situation was in front of him, In-gong thought it was foolish to say such words to him.</p><p>However, he relaxed thanks to that. In-gong thought of the reason he was targeting Mustafa.</p><p>It was to win. He was here because he was confident he could win the fight.</p><p>&#x201C;Dragon Blood.&#x201D;</p><p>He had the special skill of a dragon humanoid. The dragon power located in In-gong&#x2019;s body and soul was provoked.</p><p>His aura and magic power were strengthened. His stats had also all increased. He didn&#x2019;t open the status window but it was obvious they had jumped by at least 10%.</p><p>Moreover, Dragon Blood had an unexpected efficacy.</p><p>Earth Quaker gave a low growl. Red and yellow light emitted through the black armour and it transformed into a more aggressive form.</p><p>Earth Quaker contained the power of Enkidu. It was natural that it would respond to a dragon humanoid. This could be called the true form of Earth Quaker.</p><p>[Earth Quaker&#x2019;s internal skill - Gigantic Piston Lv1 has been acquired.]</p><p>[Earth Quaker has opened some of its true power. The effect of Earth Quaker will be recalibrated.]</p><p>[Strength has increased by 20.]</p><p>[Agility has increased by 15.]</p><p>[Persistence has increased by 20.]</p><p>[The levels of Magic Power Control and Aura have risen by one.]</p><p>Green Wind didn&#x2019;t stay still either and In-gong received her blessing.</p><p>[Strength has increased by 10%.]</p><p>[Agility has increased by 10%.]</p><p>[Durability has increased by 10%.]</p><p>[Persistence has increased by 10%.]</p><p>[Protection of the Wind is activated. Your movements have improved.]</p><p>[Grassland Reclamation is activated. Healing of injuries will speed up.]</p><p>[Protection of the Wind Lv1 has been learnt.]</p><p>[Grassland Reclamation Lv1 has been learnt.]</p><p>A clear voice was heard constantly in his head. He felt uncomfortable due to the significant rise in ability.</p><p>However, In-gong didn&#x2019;t panic. His new Conquest abilities had also risen. He faced Mustafa and formed a fist.</p><p>&#x201C;I will try it.&#x201D;</p><p>In-gong jumped down from the draco instead of rushing in. He took the posture of Beast Authority and activated Divine Beast Authority.</p><p>A pure white aura...</p><p>It flowed between the red and yellow lights of Earth Quaker.</p><p>The green light originated from Green Wind.</p><p>In-gong, who was covered in various buffs, beckoned to Mustafa as a taunt.</p><p>Mustafa couldn&#x2019;t stand it. He roared again and rushed toward In-gong.</p><p>It was an unbelievable speed for someone over four meters tall. He was like a runaway train.</p><p>In-gong glared as he stared at what was before him. Green Wind read Mustafa&#x2019;s trajectory.</p><p>She determined whether it was a front, side or diagonal direction.</p><p>In-gong kicked against the ground. He estimated Mustafa&#x2019;s trajectory and rolled on the ground. He jumped up and struck the lower half of Mustafa accurately on the side.</p><p>The power of an explosion!</p><p><em>Kwaang!</em></p><p>Aura exploded and Mustafa&#x2019;s body flew up approximately one meter in a diagonal direction. However, shortly afterwards, Mustafa swung at In-gong&#x2019;s head.</p><p>In-gong managed to avoid the attack intuitively. It was impossible to damage the lower half that was covered with thick scales. Moreover, Mustafa&#x2019;s reflexes were surprising. He rose one meter in a diagonal line because he jumped at the moment of the attack. Although the angle meant the attack wasn&#x2019;t fully received, the performance was clear.</p><p>It was true for the shocked Mustafa. In-gong&#x2019;s blow had far exceeded Mustafa&#x2019;s expectation. Mustafa raised his scythe again like he was hiding the pain. Rather than stopping Mustafa&#x2019;s attacks, In-gong ran to Mustafa in order to limit his trajectory.</p><p>&#x2018;Don&#x2019;t drag this out for a long time.&#x2019;</p><p>Due to the various buffs, his stats skyrocketed but it was taking a toll on his body. Moreover, he was now in an evasive fight, so his concentration was being exhausted quickly. A long fight was disadvantageous for In-gong.</p><p>He needed to finish it with one shot. He would finish the fight by aiming a blow at the upper body.</p><p>In-gong focused the white aura on his right arm. He didn&#x2019;t just focus on the explosion but condensed it on Earth Quaker. The white light surrounded Earth Quaker and it made a noise like an engine from a sports car.</p><p>Mustafa sensed the danger and sped up his attacks while In-gong continued to flee from the attacks. Mustafa got angry then and covered his scythe with a purple light.</p><p>One hit would kill In-gong.</p><p>At that moment, the scythe struck like a thunderbolt. In-gong barely evaded it and Mustafa opened his mouth. It wasn&#x2019;t a mere roar, but a distinctive drake ogre battle cry that caused mental collapse.</p><p>Mustafa aimed a wild blow at him but this was a chance for In-gong. As soon as the battle cry emerged, the Tears of a Dark Elf hanging from his neck turned purple and blocked Mustafa&#x2019;s spiritual attack.</p><p>He would take this chance.</p><p>In-gong responded immediately. He didn&#x2019;t hesitate to run toward the blow.</p><p>&#x201C;Carack!&#x201D;</p><p>It wasn&#x2019;t a mere cry; he was using a skill.</p><p>The King&apos;s Knights- Call!</p><p>Carack appeared in the space in front of In-gong. Carack was baffled by the sudden move but he was an orc. Instead of asking what had happened while facing Mustafa, he followed his warrior&#x2019;s instinct.</p><p>&#x201C;Kuraha!&#x201D;</p><p>He shouted loudly and struck Mustafa&#x2019;s leg with an axe. Although the blade didn&#x2019;t entirely hit, Mustafa&#x2019;s legs buckled momentarily. At that moment, In-gong leapt forward. He ran up the back of the trusty Carack and looked down on Mustafa.</p><p>Mustafa raised his head quickly and saw In-gong who then pulled back his right fist and used his hidden card.</p><p>&#x2018;Telekinesis!&#x2019;</p><p>Mustafa&#x2019;s head twisted. It was only a few centimetres at most, but that was enough. Mustafa lost sight of In-gong and was unable to respond properly due to the sudden event. In-gong&#x2019;s hand stretched out and hit Mustafa&#x2019;s head.</p><p>It was something other than the power of an explosion. The condensed aura and power in Earth Quaker exploded at once!</p><p>Gigantic Piston!</p><p>Earth Quaker howled. There was a loud roar as the condensed aura emerged. The intensity didn&#x2019;t just penetrate the giant Mustafa&#x2019;s head, but his whole body as well.</p><p>Mustafa&#x2019;s head exploded. His four legs couldn&#x2019;t endure the power and broke.</p><p>In-gong then landed on the ground. He was exhausted because he had consumed too much of his aura at once. However, he didn&#x2019;t collapse. He breathed roughly and raised his head.</p><p>Mustafa&apos;s body, however, collapsed. He fell to the ground with a great sound and a purple light rose up from his body. It soared into the sky and scattered into pieces.</p><p>The drake ogres screamed. The casios had lost the purple aura around them and cried out in confusion.</p><p>In-gong, who was breathing roughly, didn&#x2019;t hear any of those noises. It was because a clear voice had entered In-gong&#x2019;s ears.</p><p>[Your level has risen.]</p><p>The white light wrapped around In-gong&#x2019;s body.</p><hr><p><br></p><p><br></p></div><p><br></p>
