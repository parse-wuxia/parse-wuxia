He had gazed at the 2nd Prince with interested eyes, but that was all.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">He hadn&#x2019;t greeted them or acted friendly.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Moreover, there was one important fact.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x2018;It&apos;s been a month.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x2018;How are you?&#x2019;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">The combination of everything and this short greeting resulted in only one conclusion:</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">9th Prince and the sword duke had met in the past.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Additionally, it had been during just this past one month.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Those who were participating in the court gathering weren&#x2019;t stupid; most of them remembered the last court gathering.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">The last court gathering...</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">The day afterwards, 9th Prince had headed to Thunderdoom Fortress.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x2018;How had the 9th Prince met the sword duke? Had the sword duke gone to visit 9th Prince?&#x2019;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x2018;Moreover, it wasn&#x2019;t somebody else but truly the sword duke?&#x2019;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x2018;The sword duke?!&#x2019;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">These questions raised some doubts.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">The shock caused an even greater impact.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">1st Prince Baikal Ragnaros flinched. He wanted to look behind him.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">3rd Prince Victor Nekrion, on the other hand, couldn&#x2019;t endure it. He looked back with a confused and awkward expression.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">4th Princess Anastasia Nekrion repressed herself, but she also revealed a slight shaking in her body.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">It was just the 2nd Prince who didn&#x2019;t seem to care. However, In-gong didn&#x2019;t care about any of this. Everyone was busy looking between the sword duke and In-gong, while In-gong was struggling with the ripples caused by the sword duke&#x2019;s greeting.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Felicia repressed an urge to press her hand to her chest and her stomach hurt like she had often read in the novels she read as a hobby. This was definitely something that hurt her stomach.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x2018;Sword duke! You are already getting too much attention!&#x2019;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">The sword duke had certainly said it at Thunderdoom Fortress.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">He had said the fact that 9th Prince had combined Sura Heart Law and Divine Beast Authority into Divine Sura Authority should be concealed.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">9th Prince was already receiving too much attention. If this fact was known, people would be even more wary toward him.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Then what was this? Was this the trial that often appeared in novels? Or perhaps, it was a test?</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x2018;What is this bullying?&#x2019;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">There shouldn&#x2019;t be trials or tests.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Felicia erased all the prideful things in her head, trying to calm her mind and maintain her composure.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Anyway, it was a situation where the sword duke had greeted In-gong.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">There had to be a response.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">How should he respond? Should he greet the sword duke? Or should he maintain his silence in front of the demon king?</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">It was not Felicia but In-gong who needed to respond. Even so, her stomach was hurting. It was really bad for her heart.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Only a few seconds had passed by.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">During this period of time that was both short and long, Felicia was caught up in her pained thoughts while everyone was amazed.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;Oh, I was rude. I forgot this is the inner palace of the demon king.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">The sword duke spoke again. He bowed to the demon king in apology and the demon king accepted it with his usual face.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">The storm had passed.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">However, the calm after the storm wasn&#x2019;t calm.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Pent-up emotions&#x2026;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">The atmosphere in the Demon King&#x2019;s Palace was like trying to hide a mess with a big white cloth.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">This incident didn&#x2019;t take&#xA0;long&#xA0;to pass. It was thanks to Isabella, the organizer of the court gathering, remembering her duties.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;9... No, 5th Prince, Silvan Doomblade.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">It was a minor misstep but most people understood the mistake. No, there were many who didn&#x2019;t even realize the mistake.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">For example, Silvan who stepped forward. Additionally, Felicia, who was watching Silvan, felt an intense pain in her stomach and heart again.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x2018;Silvan! Your hands and feet should go together!&#x2019;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Why was Silvan the one who had to go out first?</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Silvan had received a very big shock because he had always wanted to be noticed by the sword duke. His steps were awkward like a man who had forgotten how to walk, but fortunately, everyone was still in shock. There were a few who noticed Silvan&#x2019;s mistake, but Silvan was able to show the proper procedure when he reached the demon king. This was due to Silvan having been born as a prince and grown up as one.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Felicia sighed with relief, but she then became tense again.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;6th Princess, Felicia Doomblade.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Why was she next after Silvan?</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Felicia blamed the 3rd Queen Sylvia Doomblade for a moment, then stepped forward gracefully at Isabella&apos;s call stepping forward at Isabella&#x2019;s call.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">After that were Chris and Caitlin. Thanks to having some time to prepare, the two people were able to regain their composure and showed much more relaxed appearances than Silvan and Felicia had shown.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Chris was smiling confidently as always while Caitlin had a gentle expression on her face.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Then finally, it was In-gong&#x2019;s turn.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;9th Prince, Shutra Ignus.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">In-gong&#x2019;s steps coincided with Isabella&#x2019;s call. It was like crossing a sea of gazes, but In-gong just smiled.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x2018;This is the third.&#x2019;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">The fact that humans were creatures of adaptation seemed to fit this perfectly.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">As he stood on the right of all the royal children, In-gong got down on one knee before the demon king.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">As usual, it was time to announce the merits of all the royal children who participated in the court gathering.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">However, this court gathering wasn&#x2019;t to announce the merits and appreciate the achievements.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">After looking at all his children for a moment, the demon king glanced at the sword duke.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Sword Duke, did you leave the sanctuary a while ago to meet Shutra?&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">After the demon king&#x2019;s question, everyone listened attentively. The fact that the demon king spoke in the court gathering had no great impact now.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Not only was the other person the teacher of the demon king, but the question itself was very interesting.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">The sword duke had left the sanctuary.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Moreover, it had been in order to meet the 9th Prince.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Most people in the room didn&#x2019;t know what the sanctuary was, but the important thing wasn&#x2019;t the sanctuary. The important thing was that the sword duke had come personally to meet with 9th Prince.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Everyone paid attention to the sword duke&#x2019;s answer. The sword duke laughed lightly and replied,</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;That&apos;s correct. It was a short but pleasant meeting. There was the taste of being a teacher.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">It was a short answer, but they were words that absolutely couldn&#x2019;t be missed.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">The taste of teaching&#x2026;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Felicia&#x2019;s heart sank. Silvan froze with his mouth hanging open, while 3rd Prince Victor gritted his teeth.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">One of the captains opened his mouth and said,</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Sword Duke, does that mean that 9th Prince is your disciple?&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">It was Gallehed, the leader of the captains and a sura.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Among the sura, he was born with very rare blonde hair and was a handsome but gentle person.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">If he only had a bright smile on his face,Gallehed would have been like the sun. However, for whatever reason, there was always darkness on one corner of his face.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">He represented the captains, so they were also interested in the answer.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">The sword duke answered the question coolly.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;9th Prince doesn&#x2019;t use the sword. So, I could only teach him a few things.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Someone swallowed their saliva.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">The storm had ended only to reveal a larger storm.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">According to his words, the 9th Prince would have become the sword duke&#x2019;s disciple if he used a sword.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Even Gallehed, who had asked the question, was shocked. Of course, it had been one of the main possible answers but this was the sword duke who was saying it.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Silvan&#x2019;s face changed again. Felicia was overwhelmed with the urge to hug Silvan, but she endured it. It was then that she realized the sword duke&#x2019;s intention:</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">The sword duke didn&#x2019;t want to drive In-gong into a crisis.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">It was quite the opposite.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&apos;It is a situation in which he is already attracting attention. He is thinking like us.&#x2019;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">It was inevitable that they needed to be vigilant. If so, it was better to make a bigger impression on the people, than the other children of the demon king. It would give In-gong a chance to gather people.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">In-gong, Felicia and Chris, they all thought this.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Additionally, it was the same for the sword duke.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">It was natural to be vigilant. It was also natural to be alarmed, however, one shouldn&apos;t irritate him.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Irritate him&#x2026;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Unless it was an emotional or extreme situation, they shouldn&#x2019;t do a preemptive strike.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">For most cases of preemptive attacks, the attackers were weaker than the defenders.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x2018;Simply put, he isn&#x2019;t easy to deal with.&#x2019;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">The 9th Prince was such a person. He hadn&#x2019;t been worth touching at all due to having no background.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">However, 6th Princess and 7th Prince were now standing behind the 9th Prince. Additionally, the sword duke had revealed himself.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">They couldn&#x2019;t even imagine touching him.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Richard, the draconian among the captains, narrowed his eyes. Yecaderina, a nightmare and another one of the captains, gave a cold smile.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Interesting.&quot;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">The demon king said. Then his next words focused all attention on Isabella.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Go ahead.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;U-understood!&quot;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Isabella unwittingly answered loudly and licked her lips. With a voice that was trembling slightly, she announced the purpose of this court gathering to everyone.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;This is happening in various places on the periphery of the Demon World.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">With those ominous words, In-gong opened a large light map of the Demon World.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">In Knight Saga, the Demon World wasn&#x2019;t a hell-like place.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">It was a place inhabited by many species that could be called humans.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Of course, compare to it was a much more explicit zone compared to the Human World, so it was a land where ruthless and inhuman events often occurred. However, it wasn&#x2019;t a barbaric land.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">In fact, the true place that humans thought of as the Demon World was actually spread out north of the Demon World.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">The land of icecaps that existed beyond the Northern Limit Line&#x2026;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">It was an environment that could only be seen as hostile and all types of creatures had adapted to live in this hell.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">The biggest role of the generals was to keep the Northern Limit Line from spilling over to here.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Of course, it wasn&#x2019;t just the land to the north.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Although it wasn&#x2019;t directly in contact with the buffer zone, the area to the south was also a boundary. Just like how the lands beyond the Northern Limit Line waren&#x2019;t worth conquering, the south contained multiple small tribes that were enemies of the Demon World.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">The northern land, the Human World and the enemies on the periphery&#x2026;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Was one of them moving?</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Isabella explained in solemn tone,</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;In the past two months, five areas on the periphery have been attacked by those surrounded by a purple aura. As a result, three of the five areas have become a patch if desert or wilderness.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Among the five areas shown on the map, Enger Plains was present.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;The first attack occurred at Enger Plains. And like it had been announced at the last court gathering, 6th Princess and 9th Prince managed to block this attack.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">The other four areas were scattered all over the place, without any common ground.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;The last area that got attacked was Spider Forest near the lycanthrope territory. It is special because it isn&#x2019;t on the edge of the Demon World but requires travelling inward to reach it. It was 5th Prince, 6th Princess, 8th Princess and 9th Prince who prevented the attack on Spider Forest.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">In-gong swallowed his saliva.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Without In-gong knowing it, the Death Knight had been attacking different areas in the Demon World. As a result, three of the five areas had become a patch of desert or wilderness.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x2018;The guardians were killed.&#x2019;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Enger Plains had been created with Ainkel&#x2019;s magic, so it was simple logic to think that it would become a desert if the magic was released.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">However, what about the other places? Did the guardians have another role that In-gong didn&#x2019;t know about?</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Anyway, it was already happening. The Death Knight, who wanted the end, was attacking throughout the Demon World.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;There was a report that people with a purple aura appeared in Thunderdoom Fortress. As a result of the series of events, we have determined that this hostile force can&#x2019;t be overlooked and have summoned you here to smash them.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Isabella stopped talking for a while before snapping her fingers to transform the map. In addition to the desert and wilderness areas, some turned into a more prominent colour.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;These are the areas that are expected to be attacked. We have summoned the princes and princesses to the Demon King&#x2019;s Palace in order to defend each region from the enemy&#x2019;s attack and trace the enemy&#x2019;s stronghold.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">If he took a step back, it matched the missions he&#x2019;d had so far.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Isabella looked at In-gong.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;As 9th Prince and 6th Princess were the ones to first detect the enemy and fend off two attacks, they will be given first choice. Do you have an area that you would like to be dispatched to?&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">It was a somewhat difficult subject to decide on the spot. However, this was typical for the Demon King&#x2019;s Palace.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">As the sword duke said, the Demon King&#x2019;s Palace was very familiar with these challenges. They wouldn&#x2019;t shrink back from a few sudden raids. Instead, it was a place to evaluate the demon king&#x2019;s children.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">In-gong looked at the map. In each area, there was brief information about the characteristics of the region and the troops dispatched to that area.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">The ability to pick a region to defend would also be a factor in evaluating the children of the demon king.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">In-gong recalled the information he had about each area from Knight Saga, having remembered the rough geographical features.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">There was one good place to defend due to the area&#x2019;s natural characteristics. On the other hand, another area was hard to defend because everywhere was open space.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">In-gong laughed at his thoughts. It was a difficult place to defend, so he should avoid it, but his mind naturally went there.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x2018;General Vandal.&#x2019;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">It was the area he had been dispatched to after taking care of the Red Lightning tribe. Since a crisis was an opportunity, this might be the best chance to acquire General Vandal.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&apos;Of course, that is only if I can win.&#x2019;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">It would be a challenge. In-gong took a deep breath to calm his mind and said,</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;I will go to Evian.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Some people were relieved by In-gong&#x2019;s declaration while others questioned it. In the end, there were those who laughed at him and said he was only a child.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Evian wasn&#x2019;t a good place for defense, nor was it very important.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Even Felicia wondered why In-gong chose that place.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">However, there was only one person who thought differently.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">This person had wanted to go to Evian the moment the map had been opened.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Zephyr narrowed his eyes as he looked at In-gong.</span></p><hr><p><br></p></div>
