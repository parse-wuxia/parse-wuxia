<p><span>Chapter 148 - Chapter 28: Demon King</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p><p><span>The contents of the invitation didn&#x2019;t change even though he read it again.&#xA0;</span><span>The sender was the demon king, and the time was tomorrow morning. The place was the residence of the demon king, called the Black Castle.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>Carack received the invitation from In-gong, and his eyes widened with surprise.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;P-prince?&#x201D;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>In-gong had just handed Carack something very serious. This was a natural reaction when it came to anything related to the demon king.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>The demon king&#x2014;the apex of the Demon World, and the strongest person in the Demon World.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>He had called out to In-gong. This time, it wouldn&#x2019;t be a public place like the court gathering. According to the invitation, it was an informal meeting.&#xA0;</span><span>The other person was the demon king, and this fact preceded their relationship of father and son.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&apos;This is the first time.&#x2019;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>An informal meeting with the demon king was something he had never experienced in Knight Saga. In other words, Zephyr was never invited in this way.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>In-gong wondered why the demon king had called him.&#xA0;</span><span>Why had he done such a disruptive thing at each court gathering?&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>In-gong took a deep breath, and many possibilities passed through his mind. The first thing he thought about was the Four Knights of the Apocalypse.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>In-gong had reported that Gerard had been the Famine Knight. The reason In-gong had been able to find out the specific word, &#x2018;Famine&#x2019;, was because Gerard had said it himself.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>In the cases of Death and War, it was a little more ambiguous.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>Gerard had been the Famine Knight and had the power of Famine. There seemed to be a commonality between the power of those with the purple aura and the red power which the barbarian king had used. Additionally, the barbarian king had said the word &#x2018;War&#x2019;.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>The keyword &#x2018;Death&#x2019; hadn&#x2019;t been said, but this was enough. If the Demon King&#x2019;s Palace had information on the Four Knights of the Apocalypse, it would be easy for them to make the connection.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>Did the demon king want a more specific report? Or had he realized In-gong was the Conquest Knight? </span><span>Maybe it could be both. There might also be a reason which In-gong couldn&#x2019;t guess. It could truly just be a father and son dialogue.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&#x2018;That is hard to imagine.&#x2019;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>Anyhow, the invitation had arrived, and there was no such thing as a veto. He could only accept the invitation.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Brace yourself.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>Carack said with a serious expression. In-gong laughed bitterly and asked Flora,&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Flora, who brought the invitation?&#x201D;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&quot;It was a knight of the royal guards who was wearing a black cloak.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>The classification in the Demon King&#x2019;s Palace could be determined based on the colour of their cloaks. Among the knights, only the guards of the demon king could wear black cloaks.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&quot;As expected from the demon king&#x2019;s invitation.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>Carack said with admiration. In-gong nodded.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Yes.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>The leader of the guards was Reinhardt, one of the five captains. He was a yaksha and didn&#x2019;t belong to any of the factions.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&#x2018;The Silent Reinhardt. He is a good escort of the demon king.&#x2019;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>In Knight Saga, he had always been a difficult opponent to face. </span><span>After thinking about Reinhardt for a bit, In-gong looked at Flora and said,&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Flora, keep this invitation a secret.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;I will do so.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>Flora agreed without asking why. It was natural behaviour as a butler.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>Carack blinked and asked,&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Prince, are you not going to even tell the princess?&#x201D;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>He was referring to Felicia more than Caitlin. In-gong slightly shrugged and said,&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;She will only worry about it.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>It would be nice to talk to Felicia who was his political adviser, but she couldn&#x2019;t give any advice regarding the encounter with the demon king. From the outset, he didn&#x2019;t even know why the demon king was calling.&#xA0;</span><span>It was better to keep it a secret because it would just worry Felicia. Moreover, the meeting with the demon king wasn&#x2019;t in the distant future but tomorrow morning.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>In-gong summarized the situation roughly and said to Carack and Flora,&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Let&#x2019;s take a break until tomorrow. And Flora, make dinner a little later than usual. Additionally, Amita, Daphne, Nayatra and Karma will be joining us.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&quot;I will follow your words.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>He had been so busy since returning to the Demon King&#x2019;s Palace that he hadn&#x2019;t been able to rest. It was necessary for him to think about some things.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Carack, I&#x2019;ll be resting in my room until dinner. You don&#x2019;t have to come along since I&#x2019;ll be hanging out alone.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Understood. Then I won&#x2019;t be in the same room.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>Carack responded with an exhausted face, and In-gong smiled back at him. Carack truly was very helpful.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&#x2018;Then I will take a break.&#x2019;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>After the 3rd Queen&#x2019;s tea ceremony, there were many things for him to think about. So, he would rest and delay his training until after dinner.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>However, that plan had to be modified the moment In-gong opened his bedroom door. The long day wasn&#x2019;t over just yet.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&quot;You came later than I thought.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>The 4th Queen Elaine Moonlight was sitting gracefully on a small sofa in his bedroom. As always, Ludwig was behind her.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>As he thought about the current situation, In-gong suppressed the desire to close the door and pretend not to see anything. Why was Elaine here? And why didn&#x2019;t Flora tell him about Elaine&#x2019;s visit?&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&quot;I came in secret. You should pay more attention to security.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>In-gong smiled and closed his bedroom door. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&quot;It is nice to see you again.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&quot;This is an informal place, like the tea party, so there is no need to talk like that.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>Elaine was the one to relax the formalities. She invited In-gong to sit in the opposite chair, and he didn&#x2019;t refuse. He pushed back his fatigue as he faced Elaine.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Did something happen?&#x201D;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>He suppressed it as much as possible but a little bit of displeasure showed. Elaine seemed to catch a glimpse of it and made an apologetic expression.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&quot;I couldn&#x2019;t talk to you properly at Sylvia&#x2019;s tea party. Shutra, you know why I came to the Demon King&#x2019;s Palace, right?&#x201D;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>It was just like how Sylvia couldn&#x2019;t talk about the fairy.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>In-gong nodded instead of answering, and Elaine let out a long breath.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Gerard Moonlight. My dear brother, whom the lycanthropes were so proud of.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>In-gong was a little bit disconcerted by the affection which dripped from her voice. Did she have a grudge against In-gong like Felicia was worried about?&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>However, fortunately, it was groundless. Elaine waved her hands and said,&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&quot;There is no need to stress. I want to thank you. It is a really funny story, but... I&#x2019;m glad. Once again, I don&#x2019;t have to risk my life fighting against Gerard.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>Her brother had gone crazy. She had known there was no way other to stop him, other than to kill him.&#xA0;</span><span>However, even so, he was her brother, and even now, pleasant memories rose when she closed her eyes.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>Elaine was good at hiding her feelings, but not this time. She gave a low sigh as her eyes became damp.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>In-gong didn&#x2019;t dare say anything and just waited. Elaine hid all her emotions with a smile, and In-gong felt in awe as he looked at her.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&quot;You are becoming stronger really quickly. Like Caitlin said, you are completely amazing.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>At the end, Elaine smiled brightly in a way which was different than normal. However, it really suited her.&#xA0;</span><span>She looked just like Caitlin, so In-gong flinched involuntarily as she spoke in a manner similar to Caitlin.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&#x2018;Master, do you like the word &#x2018;amazing&#x2019; that much?&#x2019;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>Green Wind whispered into his ears. As a result, In-gong regained his spirit and fixed his expression quickly.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>Elaine just laughed. She let out a long breath once again and stared straight at In-gong.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;I just wanted to thank you, Shutra. Thank you very much.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>It was just like Sylvia at the tea party. Elaine had an innocent, pure heart.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>However, that didn&#x2019;t last long. Elaine restored her confident expression and leaned back against her chair.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;This isn&#x2019;t enough. You have helped resolve a longstanding problem of the lycanthropes. If you have something you want, tell me. If I can do it, I will try hard to give you the appropriate compensation.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>It was a very pleasant speech but confusing as well. In-gong faced Elaine as he started thinking, and the first thing that came to mind was being hit by Divine Beast Authority.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&#x2018;Be reasonable, reasonable.&#x2019;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>It was a very attractive reward, but there was no way to convince Elaine. Being hit as a reward&#x2026; nobody would be crazy enough to make the suggestion.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>It was at that moment&#x2014;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Do you want to be hit with aura?&#x201D;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>Elaine asked playfully, and In-gong flinched reflexively. Then Elaine&#x2019;s expression became one of embarrassment.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Uh, did you really think of that?&#x201D;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>In-gong was equally embarrassed and couldn&#x2019;t answer right away. Elaine became more embarrassed as he stayed silent.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Uh, um. Yes. I respect your taste... Yes, I respect you.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Ah, no! That&#x2019;s not it!&#x201D;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>In-gong stood up and waved his hands.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&quot;I would like to learn Divine Beast Authority a little deeper. I would like a spar with Queen Elaine and the leader of your guard. I was thinking about the spar and became surprised when I heard you mention aura.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>Ludwig narrowed his eyes at In-gong&#x2019;s clarification, and Elaine laughed. As In-gong sat down again, she said,&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Hmm, it isn&#x2019;t hard, but it isn&#x2019;t really a reward. You will learn it anyway. A spar with Ludwig is too heavy as a reward.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>Elaine was troubled for a moment, then finally, she sighed.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;It can&#x2019;t be helped. I will think about a separate compensation. I thought it would be easy, but it has become more difficult than I thought.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>However, there was a subtle pleasure on her face. It seemed like the process of thinking about a present was fun for her.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>As the story about the reward came to a close, Elaine pulled out a new topic.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Shutra, I saw your report to the Demon King&#x2019;s Palace. Gerard was the Famine Knight?&#x201D;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Yes, he said so.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>In-gong studied Elaine&#x2019;s response. Based on her frown, she didn&#x2019;t know anything about the Famine Knight.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&quot;I am currently collecting information. Gerard was able to escape from the Grey Tower because he had become the Famine Knight. If I find anything, I will let you know.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>It wasn&#x2019;t just information sharing.&#xA0;</span><span>In-gong realized that this was the support he hadn&#x2019;t received in the past. Maybe the dark elves also had some information to tell In-gong.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&quot;I think it is time to go back. Sorry for breaking into your bedroom.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;It is okay. Just don&#x2019;t do it often.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>Elaine laughed at In-gong&#x2019;s careful answer.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&quot;I really can&#x2019;t say anything.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>As though it was punishment for the joke, Elaine kissed him lightly on the forehead like he was her own child.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Oh, and Shutra, can I ask one more question?&#x201D;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Tell me.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>In-gong looked up at Elaine. Elaine came closer with a wicked expression and asked In-gong,&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Between Caitlin and Felicia, who do you think is cuter? Well, it makes no difference if they are cute or pretty.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Huh?&#x201D;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>Who was prettier? What type of question was this?&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>However, Elaine was quite serious.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&quot;It isn&#x2019;t a joke. I&#x2019;m serious.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Uh...&#x201D;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>In-gong was unable to answer. Then Elaine clicked her tongue and increased the distance.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&quot;I am satisfied with just that answer. It is obvious, but I am looking forward to getting to know you better. Then I&#x2019;ll see you next time.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>Elaine knocked on In-gong&#x2019;s shoulder and walked out of the bedroom. It seemed like she was going out the front door, unlike when she came in.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>Flora was shocked to see her, but saw her off. In-gong apologized to Flora briefly before lying down on his bed.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&amp; &#xA0;</span></p><p><span>The long day was over, and a new morning shone.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>In-gong had gone to bed early and started the day with his usual routine.&#xA0;</span><span>An informal meeting with the demon king was an extraordinary event, but it was important to maintain his composure.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>In-gong postponed meeting Felicia and Caitlin at the Merits Department to the afternoon and left his house with a calm mind. He travelled to the Black Castle, the demon king&#x2019;s residence, in a carriage.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&quot;I&#x2019;m nervous.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>Carack said what In-gong was thinking. He had visited the Black Castle every time for the court gathering, but it felt different today.&#xA0;</span><span>The invitation had only stated that the location was the Black Castle, so In-gong thought someone would come out.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>As expected, there was someone waiting for In-gong.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;It has been a while. In the meantime, you&#x2019;ve become stronger.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Sword Duke!&#x201D;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>In-gong had thought a guard would be waiting for him, so he was full of pleasure at the surprise. The sword duke sent him a relaxed smile.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&quot;I heard about your activities. Everyone at the court gathering was astonished.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>The sword duke was suddenly standing right in front of In-gong. In-gong couldn&#x2019;t grasp the movement and stared with admiration. He still had a long way to go before he would reach the sword duke&#x2019;s level.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&quot;It is just a little trick, so don&#x2019;t be surprised. Frankly, Prince is more amazing from my perspective.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>The sword duke had grasped it almost immediately. In-gong&#x2019;s current strength was no comparison to when he had been at Thunderdoom Fortress.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&quot;I&#x2019;d like to talk to Prince more, but unfortunately, I have to give priority to my mission. From now on, stay focused as I guide you.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>The sword duke then spoke to Carack,&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Please stay here. You won&#x2019;t be able to follow any further.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>Carack looked at In-gong instead of replying to the sword duke. In-gong nodded once.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Understood. I&#x2019;ll wait here.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>Carack replied to In-gong with a determined expression, but he couldn&#x2019;t hide his worried gaze.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&quot;I thought it before, but Prince really has a good aide.&quot;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>The sword duke laughed before stepping forward. The surrounding landscape changed instantly.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>In-gong focused his mind like the sword duke had said to do. In-gong was sensitive to magic and could feel the strong torrents of magic power rushing around like a storm. If he was just a little bit distracted, he would get lost in the torrent of magic power.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>The sword duke continued walking, while In-gong triggered his quad-core. This process of moving along with the sword duke seemed like a test to see if he had the minimum qualifications.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>Some time passed by.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>The surrounding landscape then became fixed.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>There was a white building, reminiscent of a temple under a dark blue sky. Other than that, the darkness was so thick that In-gong couldn&#x2019;t see anything other than the building. In-gong and the sword duke were standing on the stone stairs leading to the building.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&quot;I can only go with you up to here. The demon king is there.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>The sword duke pointed to the white building.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>Taking a deep breath, In-gong took a step forward.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>Then finally, beyond the staircase, the demon king was there, standing in the middle of the building.&#xA0;</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p>
