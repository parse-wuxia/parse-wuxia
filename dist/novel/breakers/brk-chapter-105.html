Stay away! Don&#x2019;t tease me! Why the hell did you bring this brat? I had decided we&#x2019;re to keep it a secret! This is a breach of contract!&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Amita banged their tail against the floor.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">It seemed like they were angrier than usual.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">However, as usual, the party didn&#x2019;t pay attention to Amita&#x2019;s anger.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;The raccoon wearing glasses is cute!&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Caitlin patted her cheeks and sighed.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Caitlin&#x2019;s eyes shone brightly when she saw Amita wearing large, round glasses.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">That wasn&#x2019;t all. Amita was squatting on the floor and embroidering a piece of cloth that Daphne was holding.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Raccoon person, what are you doing?&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Carack asked the question that the party was curious about and Amita hit the ground with their tail again.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Can&apos;t you tell just by looking? I am embroidering!&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">There were coloured threads on a needle and a green cloth that fit well with Daphne. Felicia sighed when she saw the embroidery.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">This was because they were sophisticated magic patterns and not just decorative embroidery.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">However, the rest of the people just saw Amita&#x2019;s small hands holding a needle.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;Cute...&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Caitlin said once again, and Delia and Seira nodded in agreement.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Amita cried out again,</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Aish! Why did he come here?! And you! Don&#x2019;t smile or laugh! That expression is annoying!&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">The target of Amita&#x2019;s needle was the sword duke, who laughed and pointed at Amita&#x2019;s neck.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Amita, that necklace is something else. Did you change your job into a pet or something?&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">A collar meant it was an animal with a master. Although it was necessary to disguise Amita as an ordinary raccoon, a collar was still a collar.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;Kiiii! This is a fashion item! Fashion!&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Amita jumped up and exclaimed, causing the sword duke to laugh even more. Daphne embraced Amita from behind.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Amita, calm down. It suits you very well.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Ohh...&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Although they were supposed to be comforting words, Amita&#x2019;s shoulders sagged after hearing that the collar fit them. Their voice also became heavy like they felt a sudden fatigue.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Why the hell did you bring him anyway? I had decided to keep it a secret.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">As Amita directed the question to In-gong, the sword duke then opened his mouth again.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;I asked him to invite me. I heard that 9th Prince&#x2019;s party arrived with a raccoon, so I thought it might be you.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">They hadn&#x2019;t had one with them at Thunderdoom Fortress, so he was sure it was Amita when a raccoon suddenly appeared.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;However, it is really surprising. I told them your location but... I honestly hadn&#x2019;t expected you to accept the commission or to follow them.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;It is a long story, very long...&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Amita sighed with a grim expression.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Felicia glanced at Amita and asked in a cautious voice,</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Then Amita, how is your progress now?&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;What? Don&#x2019;t ask, don&#x2019;t ask! I hate people who pressure me about orders the most!&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Amita kicked their arms and legs from within Daphne&#x2019;s arms. The startled Felicia quickly explained,</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;I&#x2019;m not trying to pressure you. It&apos;s just that Silvan will go to a different place from us in a week. I want to give him the sword before that.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;Felicia.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Silvan stared at Felicia with moist eyes like he was touched. However, Felicia just pushed him aside and asked Amita again,</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;How is it?&quot;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">It was for the sake of a brother and sister. Amita was weak in this regard and shook their head quietly.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Uhh, I&#x2019;ve drafted the blueprint but haven&#x2019;t started working on it yet. It is possible if I raise the priority of the sword from now on but...&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Amita glanced at Felicia and Silvan and sighed. It was because of Felicia&#x2019;s words and Silvan&#x2019;s eager expression.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Well, I am tired of making armor, but the exterior will be simple. It will be like the sword duke&#x2019;s sword.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Amita pointed to the sword hanging from the sword duke&#x2019;s waist and the sword duke caressed it with a cheerful face.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Simplicity is best.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">As they had already seen at Thunderdoom Fortress, there were no decorations on the sword duke&#x2019;s sword. The sheath was shabby and the handle simple.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">However, Silvan nodded like he liked it.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;Thank you. I will wait happily.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">He was pleased about the fact that it would be similar to the sword duke&#x2019;s sword. It was something that Silvan would have asked for.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Once Amita gave their permission, Felicia looked at In-gong and Caitlin with an apologetic expression.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;Shutra, Caitlin, I&#x2019;m sorry. Please understand.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;Yes, Unni. I&#x2019;m fine.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;I&apos;m okay.&quot;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Caitlin and In-gong answered coolly. Caitlin thought that Felicia had a good heart.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">While In-gong&#x2026; he had plenty of things to receive from Amita. &apos;And... I am going to take Amita on this journey.&#x2019;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Silvan was going to a different area, so it was reasonable to supply him with his equipment first.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Uhh, I am getting chills all of a sudden.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Amita suddenly shivered like they heard In-gong&#x2019;s thoughts.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;By the way, are you leaving after a week?&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Yes, there is a new mission.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Felicia answered Amita&#x2019;s question. Amita frowned, then they said to In-gong,</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;Um... 9th Prince, give me Earth Quaker and White Eagle. I will go ahead with their readjustment. I&#x2019;ll have to hurry.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Will it be possible in time?&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;I will see. It isn&#x2019;t a new item but a readjustment.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Earth Quaker and White Eagle could be said to be In-gong&#x2019;s main force. As the period of unavailability increased, it would become more burdensome. It would be good to do it while in the relatively safe Demon King&#x2019;s Palace.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Well, it is good to see you. I won&#x2019;t be staying in the Demon King&#x2019;s Palace for a long time, but I will often come to visit.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">The sword duke laughed as he spoke and Amita waved their hand with a sour expression.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;You will disturb my work. Don&apos;t come, don&apos;t come. Don&#x2019;t laugh.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;Amita.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Daphne soothed Amita in an affectionate voice. It worked as Amita shook their tail and said,</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;Well, yes. That reminds me, I have one thing to show you. I completed it over the past few days. It is a good feeling when something is completed.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Ohh, what is it?&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Carack asked Amita excitedly.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Your shield. Well, it is for 9th Prince, but it will be yours.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;Ohh!&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Come along to the workshop.&quot;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Amita jumped out of Daphne&#x2019;s arms and walked out of the room. Carack looked at In-gong, clearly asking for permission, and In-gong gave it to him.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;Go.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;I&#x2019;m going.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Carack walked out of the room with light steps. The sword duke said with a smile,</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Amita now has many friends. You&#x2019;ve made a good bond.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;It is thanks to Sword Duke&#x2019;s introduction.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Anyone can receive an introduction, but it is uncommon for anyone to move Amita. You don&#x2019;t need to be so modest.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">As he said those good words, Felicia raised her hand and asked,</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Sword Duke, what happened today? Is there any more detailed information about the enemies on the periphery?&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;I&#x2019;ve heard many things and the atmosphere around the Demon King&#x2019;s Palace is bad. Even if the demon king doesn&#x2019;t mind you competing against each other, the royal children shouldn&#x2019;t harm each other. Well, it is also good that I saw 9th Prince.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">As Felicia had guessed, the sword duke had intervened to help protect In-gong.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Moreover, the sword duke&#x2019;s words were true.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Even in Knight Saga, the children of the demon king never tried to harm each other by sending assassins or poisoning the food. As the sword duke said, the demon king didn&#x2019;t want that. Those who tried to attack their siblings would receive the wrath of the demon king.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">The sword duke then answered Felicia&#x2019;s second question,</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;The enemies on the periphery... Unfortunately, that information is to be distributed by the Merits Department. There is no such thing as specially hidden information.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">After returning to the mansion from the court gathering, they had met Amita straight away, so there hadn&#x2019;t been a chance to check the information.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">The sword duke then said,</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;I&#x2019;ll just say one thing. An enemy with the strength of that spearman, who showed up at Thunderdoom Fortress, hasn&#x2019;t appeared.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">The Demon King&#x2019;s Palace was dispatching the princes and princesses.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">The surface reason was to defend each area.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">However, if In-gong stepped back and looked at it, that wasn&#x2019;t the whole truth. They were dispatching the princes and princesses knowing that enemies with the purple aura would appear.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">In addition to that, there was a second reason.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Dispatching the princes and princesses to the outside meant that the defenses in certain areas would be strengthened. In other words, the intention was to destroy the will to attack itself.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Of course, the places where the princes and princesses were dispatched were important areas that needed to be guarded.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">The basic plan was for the princes and princesses to defend the area and trace the source of the purple aura.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">After hearing the sword duke&#x2019;s words, In-gong recalled Zephyr&#x2019;s face.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">He had wanted to go to Evian.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Currently, In-gong was opposing the Death Knight and Famine Knight. However, when talking about his ultimate enemy, he couldn&#x2019;t help thinking of Zephyr.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&apos;I have to hurry.&#x2019;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">He had to secure Nayatra and accumulate the power to become the demon king.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&apos;I have to go to the library. I don&#x2019;t know if I can get the information needed at my current merit level, but it would be better than not checking.&#x2019;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">This was to prepare for the Death Knight.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Along with the Four Knights of the Apocalypse, he needed more information about Conquest, War, Death and Famine going against the elder dragons:</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">The extinction of a native species;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">The purpose of the Death Knight in killing the guardians;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">The intense affection Famine and Death had toward Conquest;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">And Watcher Ainkel&#x2019;s murder 1,000 years ago...</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">The keywords were scattered all over the place. There had to be a central axis connecting them.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Amita and Carack came back while In-gong was deep in thought.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;Prince, look at this! Didn&#x2019;t it turn out well?&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Carack held out a shield excitedly. It was a diamond shaped, black shield made of black dragon scales and leather.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;It is a little rough, but it is a tough shield.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Amita said with a proud smile.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">In-gong asked Carack,</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Can I hold it for a moment?&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Here you go.&quot;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Carack handed the shield to In-gong. Not only was the appearance crude, but it had a considerable weight.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">As In-gong held the shield, letters made of light appeared in front of him.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">[Strength has increased by 5.]</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">[Persistence has increased by 5.]</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">[Durability has increased by 5.]</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">[Built-in skill: Unite has been acquired.]</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;Huh? Unite?&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">In-gong muttered and Amita&#x2019;s eyes shone.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Heok, did you notice?&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;Huh? What does that mean? Unite?&quot;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Carack asked with wide eyes. Amita responded with a laugh,</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;There are additional parts. They can join with your shield.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Additional parts?&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Prince, give the shield back to the orc. Orc, the trigger word is caltos.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">At Amita&#x2019;s prompt, In-gong passed the shield back to Carack. Carack equipped the shield on his right arm, swallowed his saliva and shouted,</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;Caltos!&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">The moment he shouted, there were shouts outside in the hallway. It sounded like there was a struggle.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">In-gong, Silvan and Chris responded to the sound, but the sword duke raised his hand and restrained them. The reason soon appeared.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;Ohh! Ohhh!&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Additional parts flew from Amita&#x2019;s workshop and clung to Carack&#x2019;s shield with a loud clang. The servants were surprised due to the extra parts.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">With the addition of all the extra parts, Carack&#x2019;s shield nearly doubled in size. It was like looking at a big, solid gate.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;It has magic reflection ability and the physical defense also increases significantly. When it comes to simple defense, it is better than White Eagle. Don&#x2019;t worry, I&#x2019;ve thought of an easy way to carry the additional parts.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Amita raised their chin proudly, then the forgotten Green Wind&#x2019;s upset voice was heard in In-gong&#x2019;s ear.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x2018;Ah, no. My presence...&#x2019;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">In-gong laughed and said to Amita,</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Will you be able to readjust White Eagle?&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;It will be an interesting challenge.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">It was an equipment from an elder dragon.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Green Wind sighed with relief at Amita&#x2019;s answer and the others were full of expectations for their equipment.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">It was at that moment...</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">A bell rang a few times and Flora entered the room. She was embarrassed to see the group of excited people but soon return to her usual calm expression.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;9th Prince, a letter from the 1st Prince has arrived for you.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;From Baikal orabeoni?&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Instead of replying to Felicia&#x2019;s question, Flora handed the letter to In-gong.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">All eyes were focused on In-gong as he opened it.</span></p><hr><p></p><p></p></div><p></p>
