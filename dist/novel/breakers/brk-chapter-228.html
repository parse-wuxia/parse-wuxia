<p><span>Chapter 228 - Final Chapter: In-gong</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p><p><span>All the lights and sounds were violent. Then it suddenly became quiet. There was no screaming or crying. </span><span>The demon king had succeeded in destroying the red dragon. He turned the soul of the one who craved destruction back to nothing.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>The soul of the red dragon didn&#x2019;t disappear at once. The gigantic flame which had lost its essence burned gorgeously like the sun.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>[Your level has risen.]&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>[Your level has risen.]&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>[Your level has risen.]&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>[Your level has risen.]&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>[Your level has ri....]&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>[The level of Heavenly Wine has risen.]&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>[The level of Heavenly Wine has risen.]&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>[The level of Divine Scent has risen.]&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>[The level of Divine Scent has risen.]&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>[Heavenly Wine has been promoted to Ultimate Heavenly Wine.]&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>[The level of Protagonist Body has risen.]&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>[The level of Conquest has risen.]&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>[The level of Pheromones has risen.]&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>[Pheromones has been promoted to Ruling Pheromones.]&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>[You have learnt Extreme Nothingness.]&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>The letters of white light and the voice of the woman came in succession. At a quick glance, he had gained more than 10 levels at once. The messages rose on top of each other, making them seem endless, while the woman&#x2019;s voice felt more difficult to hear than usual.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&apos;What is this Ruling Pheromones?&#x2019;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>In-gong breathed out as he thought about it. His exhausted stamina, magic power. and aura were immediately refreshed by the level-up effect. In-gong closed his eyes. Somehow, he felt like sleeping.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>However, he couldn&#x2019;t sleep just yet. </span><span>There were still things which needed to be cleaned up.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&#x2018;Master!&#x2019;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Prince!&#x201D;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Shutra!&#x201D;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>Three voices called out behind him at the same time. There was no need for him to open the mini-map. In-gong raised a fist again, then he turned around as he felt the sadness and pain of the white woman.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>The Death Knight was rushing away from Carack as his feelings were being conveyed through the blue aura around him. </span><span>Resentment, rage, and hatred sought to choke the white woman&#x2019;s neck, and In-gong felt the Death Knight&#x2019;s own emotions amidst that vortex of emotion.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>In-gong could see that the Death Knight was connected with the indigenous species. The Death Knight had been king of the indigenous species in the past, and the king had lived in deep regret and despair.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>In-gong laughed, then he clashed with the Death Knight. In-gong&#x2019;s clenched fist reached the chest of the Death Knight, causing a deep dent.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>The Death Knight then started crumbling slowly from his chest, like old wood crumbling after too much time passed.&#xA0;</span><span>It was natural. The Death Knight had to endure for too long. He had already been broken in the fight against the demon king.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>Then Death rose up, and Conquest pushed against Death. The two powers collided before Death disappeared in red flames.&#xA0;</span><span>This time, In-gong sighed with relief. At this moment, something seemed to tackle In-gong.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Shutra!&#x201D;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>It was Caitlin. In-gong hugged her and laughed. Then he understood why had she run to him so urgently.&#xA0;</span><span>He was able to keep standing in the air due to Conquest, but the flames filling the surroundings were disappearing, making her unable to maintain her position.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>It was also true for Carack, who was falling.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Kuweeeh?&#x201D;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Greenie!&#x201D;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>In-gong called out the abbreviated version of Green Wind&#x2019;s name. It was a desperate call and Green Wind answered. White Eagle flew at maximum speed and caught the falling Carack.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Hah.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>In-gong felt like he had lost 10 years of his life. The final boss and intermediate bosses were now defeated, so it should be a happy ending. However, it would&#x2019;ve been a bittersweet ending if Carack had died.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&apos;There is no happy ending without Carack.&#x2019;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>In-gong laughed at the thought. Then Caitlin got his attention from her spot within In-gong&#x2019;s arms. In-gong looked down with a questioning expression, only to see Caitlin&#x2019;s face draw nearer.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>He felt a moist and soft texture. Caitlin had touched her lips to his.&#xA0;</span><span>Moreover, Caitlin&#x2019;s eyes were wide open. He couldn&#x2019;t help smiling at the &#x2018;this isn&#x2019;t it?&#x2019; expression on her face.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;What is it?&#x201D;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>In-gong asked as he withdrew. Caitlin pouted and said,</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;I don&#x2019;t know if it is delicious or not.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>In-gong laughed and kissed Caitlin again.&#xA0;</span><span>Caitlin&#x2019;s eyes widened at the completely different kiss, then she closed them and hugged In-gong tightly.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>However, this didn&#x2019;t last long because White Eagle had started to roam around In-gong while carrying Carack.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&quot;This isn&#x2019;t the time for that.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>Carack said with a halfhearted expression. In-gong released Caitlin as she stared at him with blank eyes. Although Carack&#x2019;s pronunciation was messed up, he was able to understand the meaning.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>The red flames had died down. Therefore, In-gong could see the battlefield. Despite the death of the red dragon, the black beasts were still fighting the soldiers.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>He had thought the situation would be fixed after their creator, the red dragon, died. At that moment, both In-gong and Caitlin thought the same thing. They looked at each other and cried out in panicked voices.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Felicia!&#x201D;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Felicia unni!&#x201D;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>Felicia had crashed into the ground after pushing In-gong and Caitlin forward. If the black beasts were still attacking, then her safety couldn&#x2019;t be guaranteed.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Felicia!&#x201D;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>In-gong shouted again quickly. It was the same Call he had used to summon Carack. A crack opened in the air and Felicia appeared. She was exhausted and sweaty, but she didn&#x2019;t seem to have any big injuries.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>In-gong reached out and embraced Felicia hurriedly. Felicia sighed with relief once she was in In-gong&#x2019;s arms and whispered in a small voice,&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Silvan.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Silvan had protected Felicia as always. From the sky, they watched the army fight against the black beasts.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Prince.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>Carack glanced at In-gong, who took a deep breath. He held Felicia and Caitlin with each arm, but he didn&#x2019;t put them down. In-gong rose up higher and passed down a command as the demon king.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&#x2018;Retreat. Move away from the center of the battlefield.&#x2019;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>In-gong was just like the previous demon king. Sylvia felt pained at the memories, but everyone followed In-gong&#x2019;s words without any resistance. Elaine just laughed comfortably.&#xA0;</span><span>As Silvan and the others moved away from the center, In-gong looked at the mini-map. The black beasts were gathered at the center of the battlefield. It was really a panorama of red dots.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>In-gong took in a deep breath. As Caitlin and Felicia leaned their heads against In-gong&#x2019;s chest, he declared,</span></p><p><span>&quot;I&#x2019;ll do it in one blow.&quot;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>He was talking more to Caitlin than Felicia. Caitlin read In-gong&#x2019;s intentions and nodded.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>In-gong stared at the air. As the new demon king, he built up a massive ball by adding magic power and aura, and Caitlin&#x2019;s aura transmitted to the Moonlight Core.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Black Sun.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>Of course, it wasn&#x2019;t exactly like Shutenberg&#x2019;s. If the destructive power was the same, then he wouldn&#x2019;t be able to use it. He would vaporize the army as well as the beasts.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>This was a smaller version at Level one, but this was good enough. Caitlin hugged In-gong tighter as she looked at the mass of aura and magic power. Then he dropped the black sun to the ground.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>A great silence swept the ground, and the army of black beasts was instantly gone.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>[Your level has risen.]&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>The level up was as expected since he had also defeated the Death Knight. A white light appeared around In-gong as his magic power and aura were restored.&#xA0;</span><span>However, unlike In-gong, Caitlin&#x2019;s aura and stamina were still exhausted, so she couldn&#x2019;t help grumbling.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Shutra is too much.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>Then she leaned her head forward cutely like she was sleeping.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Well, you are the same as always.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>Carack nodded at the exhausted Felicia and Caitlin on both sides of In-gong. It really was a common sight.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Prince, don&#x2019;t you care about the princesses?&#x201D;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Of course.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>Carack clicked his tongue at In-gong&#x2019;s shameless answer while Green Wind appeared with a pout. In-gong wanted to pat Green Wind&#x2019;s head but both his hands were full. He felt sorry as he used Telekinesis to do it, but Green Wind still smiled happily.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&apos;My master, look at the sky.&#x2019;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>The white woman&#x2019;s voice was heard. In-gong suddenly looked up at the sky. The last flames had disappeared and the blue sky could now be seen. The darkness was scattering and the red moon created by the red dragon&#x2019;s power had also disappeared.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>As a Drakon Kechatulla, he was able to know this. However, it wasn&#x2019;t just that. The same phenomenon was happening throughout the Demon World, and In-gong could hear the giants and lizardmen.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>In-gong&#x2019;s gaze moved to a place far away. He looked at the sky, but what he actually saw was the white woman deep in his soul. She was smiling with both joy and sorrow. Setting aside the red dragon, Death, War, and Famine were her lovers, friends, and siblings.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&#x2018;I&#x2019;m okay, my master. You have conquered me.&#x2019;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>The white woman said jokingly. In-gong smiled and looked down at the ground. Familiar faces appeared. Everyone was looking this way, except for Anastasia who was desperate to hear news about Baikal in the north. Sylvia and Elaine had strange smiles on their faces.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>In-gong exchanged looks with the sword duke before finally locking eyes with Locke and Zephyr. They were far away, but he could see both their expressions. Locke was smiling with satisfaction, while Zephyr nodded slowly before hugging Altesia, who was exhausted from her miracles.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>It seemed like there was no need to worry. In-gong hugged Felicia and Caitlin tightly again. Despite it being on the verge of sexual harassment, Felicia didn&#x2019;t say anything while Caitlin complained about the pain.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>In-gong descended slowly like he was walking on stairs. Despite defeating the red dragon and the Death Knight, not everything was over yet.</span></p><p><span>In-gong gazed at the pillar of light in the center of the Sanctuary. Then the white woman whispered in In-gong&#x2019;s ears,</span></p><p><span>&apos;You can only talk to it once. Perhaps now is the only time. Do you want to talk?&#x2019;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>There was no reason to resist. No, this was a conversation that he needed to have, even if it was through force. &#xA0;</span><span>It was at the Sanctuary&#x2019;s pillar of light, where the people of the indigenous species were located.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>In-gong closed his eyes, and their minds were connected.&#xA0;</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p>
