Where is the pain?&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;I don&#x2019;t know if you are really good or bad.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Why was he so perceptive yet insensitive about things?</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x2018;He is the real protagonist.&#x2019;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">As always, In-gong couldn&#x2019;t help having this thought. Carack returned to looking after In-gong.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Anyway, isn&#x2019;t your body better?&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">There was a deep worry buried in his rough tone. In-gong knocked on his chest.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;I&#x2019;m fine. Rather, I feel much better.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">His words were genuine. Aura was the power of life, so strengthening his aura made his life force itself stronger.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;It is strange. If I had been asleep for four days, I should be starving.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;Ah, that reminds me. Why aren&#x2019;t I hungry?&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">In-gong rubbed his belly reflexively. He only felt hard abs. Since the start, he hadn&#x2019;t been hungry.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Four days was a long time. When counting three meals a day, he had missed 12 meals, yet he wasn&#x2019;t starving.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Green Wind relieved In-gong and Carack&#x2019;s doubts.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;It is the effect of the Moonlight Extract. During your sleep over the last few days, you have been accepting the healing benefits of the Moonlight Extract.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">As always, Green Wind appeared on In-gong&#x2019;s thighs. Now that Carack had become familiar with Green Wind, he asked In-gong with disbelief,</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Um, then you will keep not being hungry?&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;It isn&#x2019;t like that. Now that you&#x2019;re awake, you will become hungry again after a time.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Green Wind replied sincerely to what could be a frustrating question. Carack sighed with relief and cried out,</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Prince, I&#x2019;m really glad. It would be a big problem if you lost the desire to eat.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">If he wasn&#x2019;t hungry, he wouldn&#x2019;t want food and his pleasure in eating would disappear. It was a really scary thing to think about.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&apos;Indeed, a genius orc.&#x2019;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">His way of thinking was definitely extraordinary.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">In-gong admired him, then changing the topic.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;How is the lycanthropes&#x2019; palace? Is it different from the Demon King&#x2019;s Palace?&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;Huh? This isn&#x2019;t the palace of the lycanthropes. It is like a house where the royalty stays.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Carack tilted his head with confusion. In-gong&#x2019;s gaze turned toward Green Wind.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;Greenie?&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">It was obvious who he was calling, but Green Wind just avoided his gaze.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Is Greenie here? Carack, do you know?&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Carack laughed instead of replying and Green Wind&#x2019;s gaze toward In-gong became colder. Green Wind opened her mouth and declared coldly,</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;I thought it was a royal palace. You are a good Master, but I feel like Master has become a little bit spiteful these days.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Then she sneaked a peek at In-gong. She was the guardian that the centaurs and satyrs of Enger Plains prayed to, but he just thought she was cute.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Well, it is similar.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">In-gong turned away from Green Wind and asked Carack again,</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;In the meantime, how have you been?&quot;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Prince and Princess were sleeping, so I was able to take a break. Karma is learning druid magic from Daphne while Prince Chris seems to be busy due to the person who ran away. Princess Felicia is staying in her room due to the lycanthrope nobles that came.&quot;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Karma hadn&#x2019;t just started learning druid magic from Daphne yesterday and it was natural that Chris was busy. However, he was somewhat nervous about Felicia.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;The lycanthrope nobles?&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;They seem to have come with Queen Elaine. Seira says that they are the queen&#x2019;s royal guards. Every one of them have an unusual red tattoo on their face.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Among the nobility, there were those who were part of Queen Elaine&#x2019;s royal guards.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">They had red tattoos on their faces.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;The Blood Companions.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Blood Companions?&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;That is what Seira called the 4th Queen&#x2019;s royal guards. They are scary.&quot;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">In the lycanthrope subjugation, aside from Chris and Caitlin, the ones who dealt the most damage aside were the blood companions.&#xA0;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">They consisted only of werewolves and all of them had some royal blood, regardless of whether it is thick or thin. Each one knew Divine Beast Authority and since they were trained with the aim of joining this unit, the connection between them was really great.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Carack shook his head at In-gong&#x2019;s explanation like it was ridiculous.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Prince seems to know everything that others don&#x2019;t.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">If Felicia was next to him, she would have nodded.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">As though he suddenly had a thought, In-gong asked Carack,</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Did you ask about that?&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Although Caitlin was asleep, he didn&#x2019;t know what she or anyone else might overhear. Carack quickly noticed In-gong&#x2019;s intentions.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;If it is about that story, I asked Delia and Seira while I was resting.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">He hadn&#x2019;t forgotten about what In-gong had told him previously at the Demon King&#x2019;s Palace. In-gong nodded with a satisfied expression.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Okay, then tell me next time.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;Understood. By the way, what about Princess?&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Carack changed the subject naturally. In-gong gazed at the sleeping Caitlin and said,</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Fortunately, she seems to be okay.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">He could still feel Caitlin&#x2019;s aura through their entwined hands. Just like In-gong, Caitlin had become healthier than before. He would have been worried about how long she was sleeping, but Green Wind said it was the medicinal effect of Moonlight Extract.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;Will both of you really get better if you hold hands like that?&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;Yes.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">In-gong replied while fixing the position of Caitlin&#x2019;s hand. Despite the fact that it was true, In-gong also thought that it was quite strange.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Master, Princess seems to be waking up.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">In-gong turned to Caitlin after hearing Green Wind&#x2019;s voice. Caitlin was opening her eyelids slowly .</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">She stared at the ceiling blankly for a moment before smiling.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;Shu...tra?&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Her voice was hoarse from being asleep for so long, but there didn&#x2019;t seem to be any abnormalities. In-gong smiled and replied,</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;It is all over. Gerard has been defeated and everyone is safe.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">He told her the most important things. Caitlin was relieved and stretched her body. Then her eyes flashed and a very embarrassed expression formed on her face. In-gong realized why and hurriedly reassured her,</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Focus on your aura. Thanks to the Moonlight Extract, both Noona and I have gained a new power.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Chris and Caitlin were geniuses and sensitive to the flow of aura. It was obvious that she would be surprised at her aura which was suddenly different.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Caitlin closed her eyes after In-gong spoke and focused on her aura. A dark blue light rose from Caitlin&#x2019;s entire body.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">After a minute or so, Caitlin&#x2019;s eyes glowed as she opened them again. In-gong playfully poured a little bit of his aura into their joined hands.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;How is it?&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Naturally, Caitlin would have noticed the Starlight Core inside her as well as In-gong.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Indeed, Caitlin laughed brightly like the moon. She exclaimed with her distinctive shining eyes,</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;Great!&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&amp;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">In-gong and Caitlin sat facing each other on the bed. After sitting up straight, the two of them held each other&#x2019;s hands and closed their eyes, breathing deeply.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">In-gong increased the level of Divine Sura Authority from three to five before circulating his aura. He had to use all the newly acquired skill points gained from defeating Gerard, but it was worth it.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">A white aura rose from In-gong&#x2019;s body. In-gong circulated his aura in the usual way, then the stream of aura from the Moonlight Core joined the cycle naturally.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">The amount of aura hadn&#x2019;t increased much. However, In-gong was able to manipulate his aura more freely. The pathways for the aura were wider and deeper, allowing the auras from the two hearts to flow faster than before. This also meant a stronger explosive force.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">However, this wasn&#x2019;t the end. The present change was only when In-gong was alone.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Right now, Caitlin was in front of him.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">The Moonlight Core responded to the Starlight Core in Caitlin. The two auras unconsciously started to become one.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Caitlin&#x2019;s dark blue aura headed to In-gong and In-gong&#x2019;s white aura wrapped around Caitlin.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">It wasn&#x2019;t about two hearts now but four hearts.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">If he had to name it, it would be a quad-core.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">There was no backlash despite the fact that different auras were being mixed together. After receiving Caitlin&#x2019;s aura, he felt the depths of Divine Beast Authority and Divine Sura Authority increasing.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">After accepting In-gong&#x2019;s aura, Caitlin started acquiring Divine Sura Authority that In-gong hadn&#x2019;t found a way to teach.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">The two of them couldn&#x2019;t help smiling. The mixture of the white and dark blue auras started circulating vigorously from the quad-core.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Their auras were getting stronger and their aura growth rate was much faster and better than before.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">In-gong and Caitlin felt great joy; it was a type of pleasure.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;I don&apos;t know but it seems to be great.&quot;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">One hour had passed since In-gong and Caitlin started circulating their aura. Carack spoke while popping foods that digested well into his mouth and Green Wind watched the two people with a relaxed expression.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;It is the power of beautiful life.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Daphne and Karma nodded and agreed with Green Wind&#x2019;s words. The two druids could feel the power of life that was the essence of aura.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Everyone was pleased and full of admiration, but there was one person who complained.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;It is good, but do they need to practice as soon as they wake up?&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Felicia muttered, frowning. She had come to see both of them after hearing that they had woken up, but she couldn&#x2019;t even say a word.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">It seemed good that both of them were smiling while training, but she couldn&#x2019;t help feeling upset.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;It is a good thing, Princess. And this is delicious. It is great cooking.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Felicia smiled as Carack praised the porridge that she made but sighed and gave up.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Some time passed by and just as everyone but Green Wind was thinking about going back...</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;I expected it, but it is even more amazing.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">It was Chris who had appeared at the door. He had appeared without any aides and turned to Felicia.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;How long has it been since they went into this state?&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;Roughly two hours.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">It was Carack who replied since he had been there since the beginning.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;Really? Then I should stop them.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;Huh? Can you do it? Isn&#x2019;t it bad to break the aura when they are training like this?&quot;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Felicia was aghast and grabbed Chris&#x2019; hand to stop him, but he shook his head and replied,</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;There is a way to break it naturally. You don&#x2019;t have to worry.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Moreover, Divine Beast Authority was something that could be practiced while walking, running and so on. If their aura was disrupted by being disturbed suddenly, it would be troublesome.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">After reassuring Felicia, Chris raised his blue aura and struck In-gong and Caitlin&#x2019;s hands. Once Chris&#x2019; enormous power emerged, Felicia and everyone else had to realize Chris&#x2019; presence. It was the same for In-gong and Caitlin as well.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">The aura around In-gong and Caitlin gradually weakened. The white and dark blue auras split apart and faded like they were scattered by the wind.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">In-gong and Caitlin woke up at the same time. Chris greeted them with a large smile.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Have you regained your consciousness?&#x2019;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Oppa!&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Caitlin stood up and rushed to Chris. Chris laughed as she hugged and babbled at him.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;You both had an amazing experience.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Caitlin nodded from Chris&#x2019; arms and In-gong also smiled in agreement. Chris put Caitlin down and said,</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Now, both of you are conscious, so you should say something to Noonim. She has been sulking.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Felicia&#x2019;s eyes widened at Chris&#x2019; words. It was because Caitlin then dragged Felicia into a hug.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Felicia struggled for a bit, but Caitlin won eventually. In-gong told Felicia,</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;I&#x2019;m glad you&#x2019;re safe.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Don&#x2019;t speak nonsense.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Felicia wanted to say more but she didn&#x2019;t. Instead of teasing Felicia as usual, Chris gathered all eyes toward him again.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;This is a good sight, but I don&#x2019;t have much time. I&#x2019;ll tell you straight away.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;What... is it?&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Felicia asked Chris in a tense and nervous voice.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Chris responded with a somewhat relaxed look.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;I am going back to the palace with the other lycanthropes today. It seems like we will be busy for a while.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">In fact, that answer had been expected to some extent. Although he was close to death, Gerard&#x2019;s death was still uncertain. The question of who helped Gerard break out also needed to be addressed and the 4th Queen couldn&#x2019;t leave the palace empty for too long.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Chris told In-gong,</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Once you meet Amita, return to the palace. Shouldn&#x2019;t we meet before you return to the Demon King&#x2019;s Palace? I will also hear the answer to the proposal then.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Felicia&#x2019;s eyes narrowed at the suggestion, but In-gong simply nodded.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;And Caitlin,&quot;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Chris pointed at Caitlin. He gazed at Caitlin, who was still hugging Felicia, and declared,</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;You should go with Shutra.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;Eh?&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;I&#x2019;m convinced after what I just saw. Right now, you need Shutra more than me. Additionally, you and Shutra are both stronger now.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">There was a variable in place called the Moonlight Core and Starlight Core. Furthermore, this was the territory of the lycanthropes, not the Demon KIng&#x2019;s Palace. So, he didn&#x2019;t need to hold Caitlin in his arms.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">However, it was clear that Chris and Caitlin were unfamiliar with this. Since she had been born, Caitlin had always gone with Chris no matter where he went.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">It had been a different story when they went to look for the Thunder Light Anvil. This wouldn&#x2019;t be one or two days but at least a fortnight spent apart.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Caitlin hesitated to reply and Chris patted her head.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;It is just this time. You don&#x2019;t have to worry.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Eung.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Caitlin nodded. Chris laughed and looked back at In-gong.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Shutra, take care of Caitlin.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;I understand, Hyung Leave it to me.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">In-gong knocked on his chest. Then Felicia, who had been watching the series of conversations, protested loudly,</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Hey, shouldn&#x2019;t you be asking me that instead of Shutra?&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Among the children of the demon king who were present, Felicia was the oldest.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Chris nodded with a serious expression and spoke to In-gong again,</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Shutra, look after Felicia noonim as well. Really, please.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;Yes, Hyung.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Hey!&quot;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Felicia protested at In-gong&#x2019;s earnest answer and Caitlin quickly bit her lip to stop from laughing.</span></p><hr><p><br></p><p><br></p></div><p><br></p>
