In-gong gazed at the minimized mini-map and commanded.</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Go to the left! Run straight to the food warehouses!&#x201D;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Since General Vandal had hit the front, there were few troops left in the base. Moreover, Chris had rushed forward and made a lot of fuss, so the remaining forces had flocked to Chris.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Even though it wasn&#x2019;t deserted, it was close to it!&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Ohhh!&#x201D;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Die!&quot;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">The orcs were fighting while rushing forward and the sight of blood filled his eyes.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Carack was showing an incredible display once again. He held an axe in one hand and a big shield in the other. As the lead orc, he crushed everything in his path.</p><p dir="ltr">In-gong didn&#x2019;t stay still. He wasn&#x2019;t fighting side-by-side with Carack, but he played a big role from behind Carack.</p><p dir="ltr">[Dagger Throwing Lv1.]&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">It was a skill he learnt yesterday specifically for today. &#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">It was just throwing a knife, but he managed to kill some orcs with it. Carack dealt most of the damage but he still received a decent amount of experience.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&#x2018;Should I learn proper archery?&#x2019;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">A bow or other long-ranged weapons were useful in a situation like this.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&#x201C;Carack! Pull to the left! Just a little bit more and we&#x2019;ll arrive at a food warehouse!&#x201D;</p><p dir="ltr">&#x201C;Ouh!&#x201D;</p><p dir="ltr">Adrenaline was being secreted as Carack responded with a strange sound. In-gong fingered his dagger and glanced around. It wasn&#x2019;t because In-gong was worried about Caitlin.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&apos;Okay, the operation... Ah, right! Felicia!&#x2019;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">In-gong searched around but didn&#x2019;t see any signs of Felicia.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&#x2018;If she is locked up, won&#x2019;t she die because of this?&#x2019;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Flames were sweeping all over the place. If she was trapped in a confined space, she might suffocate and die.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&#x2018;Does he really have no idea?&#x2019;</p><p dir="ltr">It was Chris who rushed forward and caused the fire first. Instead of setting the fire, In-gong commanded Carack.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Find Felicia!&#x201D;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&#x201C;Huh? What are you saying?&#x201D;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Carack retorted with agitation. In-gong could see tents and timber buildings, but it was too crowded.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;No, just rush it!&#x201D;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">If the enemies knew Felicia&#x2019;s value, they would try to get her out.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&#x2018;Yes, let&#x2019;s not think about it!&#x2019;</p><p dir="ltr">In-gong felt a little sorry for Felicia but he couldn&#x2019;t make a difference. Instead, he focused on the mini-map while rushing forward with Carack. In-gong perceived Felicia as a neutral NPC, so she should appear as a blue or purple dot on the map.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Even Chris and Caitlin, who he killed as Zephyr, were now solid allies. Perhaps, Felicia and Silvan could become like them.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&#x2018;Yes, there are no unconditional enemies!&#x2019;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Of course, Zephyr was an exception!&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Prince! The food warehouses!&quot;</p><p dir="ltr">Carack shouted. A few orcs around him threw flasks of explosive magic, causing a huge explosion and flames to ensue.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Kuahaha! Good ride!&#x201D;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Carack shouted like a villain with a menacing face. Instead of responding, In-gong looked around again. His first objective of the food warehouse had been taken care of, so now he could find Felicia.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&#x2018;Although it is possible to find her...&#x2019;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;This way! Somebody help!&quot;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">A sharp scream was heard before he finished his thought. The voice of a woman could clearly be distinguished from the sounds of the orcs.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">In-gong and Carack ran towards the direction where he heard the sound. Inside a semi-collapsed wooden building, a few orcs from the Red Lightning tribe were knocked out while a female dark elf with both hands tied stood in the middle of burning wreckage.</p><p dir="ltr">&#x201C;Felicia?&#x201D;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Felicia had a sharp face, silver hair, red eyes and was wearing clothes that could be called a bathing suit.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Felicia blinked with amazement at In-gong&#x2019;s call.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&#x201C;What, are you Shutra?&#x201D;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">In-gong replied with a question instead of answering.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&#x201C;How? Who knocked out all the orcs?&#x201D;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Of course, I did it! I used this uproar to try and escape but the fires are everywhere... That doesn&#x2019;t matter! Cut this rope as quickly as possible! There is a trick involved with it that is interfering with my magic!&#x201D;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Despite that, she had already halfway escaped by herself.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&#x2018;As expected from a Demon King&#x2019;s child.&#x2019;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">In-gong looked at Carak while cutting Felicia&#x2019;s rope and Carack sent a signal into the sky. A green flash crossed with a red flame in the night sky.</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;That is a signal that I found Noona! Now, let&#x2019;s go!&#x201D;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">In-gong gestured for her to come out quickly. However, Felicia was standing still with a confused face.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&#x201C;Are you sending a signal to Chris and Caitlin?&#x201D;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&#x201C;Yes! Both of them are also looking for Noona!&#x201D;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Chris said he didn&#x2019;t care if she died.</p><p dir="ltr">&apos;I will use this opportunity to make some points. If Felicia joins our faction, Silva will also come to our side!&#x2019;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Furthermore, Caitlin was sincerely worried about her.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">In-gong gestured to Felicia but she kept on blinking with shock.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&#x201C;Chris and Caitlin? They are trying to save me?&#x201D;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&apos;What, is it that shocking? Is their relationship worse than I thought?&#x2019;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">However, it was subtle. There seemed to be a lot that In-gong still didn&#x2019;t know.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&#x2018;Ah, I don&#x2019;t know. Let&#x2019;s get out of here first!&#x2019;</p><p dir="ltr">Now wasn&#x2019;t the time to be thinking about this. They needed to move.</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Prince! Those guys are coming!&quot;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Carack cried out loudly. In-gong glanced at the mini-map and saw many red dots flocking.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&#x2018;It is natural after the food warehouses are burnt.&#x2019;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Perhaps the enemy had already noticed the main purpose of In-gong&#x2019;s troops. Of course, the food warehouse was burning, so things were going smoothly.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&#x201C;Noona! Come on! Hurry!&#x201D;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&#x201C;U-understood! But calling me Noona...&#x201D;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Felicia started moving while replying to him.</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Kill them!&quot;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Turn those fellows into soup!&#x201D;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">The Red Lightning tribe orcs were rushing towards them. Arrows flew from every direction and the sound of axes could be heard.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Kuk! Hide behind me!&#x201D;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Carack placed a shield over his head and covered In-gong. In-gong reached out quickly, grabbed Felicia&#x2019;s wrist and pulled her along.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&#x201C;Kyak?&#x201D;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Ohhh!&#x201D;</p><p dir="ltr">&#x201C;Kill!&#x201D;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Fight!&#x201D;</p><p dir="ltr">The yells of the orcs swallowed up Felicia&#x2019;s scream. Carack raised his shield and shouted.</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Prince! Stick closely behind me!&#x201D;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">It was a situation where he couldn&#x2019;t afford to look at the mini-map. In-gong looked away from Carack and toward Felicia.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&#x201C;Felicia noona! Do you have any helpful magic?&#x201D;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Silvan and Felicia were capable magicians. At In-gong&#x2019;s request, Felicia recovered her spirit and nodded.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&#x201C;Uh, wait a minute. Then... Shutra! Behind you!&#x201D;</p><p dir="ltr">&#x201C;What?&#x201D;</p><p dir="ltr">In-gong looked back. While the orcs of the Red Lightning tribe were rushing forward, a flame arrow was flying towards him.</p><p dir="ltr">&#x2018;Magic?&#x2019;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">There was no room to think, so In-gong acted according to instinct. He hugged Felicia to protect her and received the flame arrow.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&#x2018;Ah, damn! This isn&#x2019;t Caitlin!&#x2019;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">It was already too late to regret it. There was terrible pain that couldn&#x2019;t even be imagined.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&#x201C;Shutra!&#x201D;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Felicia was the one who screamed with aghast instead of In-gong. He found a single strand of pleasure in the midst of this suffering - that&#x2019;s right.</p><p dir="ltr">[Magic Power Control Lv1 has been learnt.]&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">[Fire Arrow Lv1 has been learnt.]&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Magic!&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">In-gong groaned and released Felicia. He turned around and shouted,&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&#x201C;Fire Arrow!&#x201D;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">A fire arrow made of magic!</p><p dir="ltr">A spark emerged from In-gong&#x2019;s fingertips and flew towards the orcs.</p><hr><p><br></p><p><br></p></div><p><br></p>
