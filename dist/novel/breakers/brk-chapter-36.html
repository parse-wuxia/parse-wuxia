Please wait a moment.]&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">A woman&#x2019;s voice rang in his head as he activated the skill. In-gong&#x2019;s eyes widened.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&#x2018;A group of knights will be created? Perhaps this is similar to a guild creation?&#x2019;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">A window of light stretched out in front of him after the order of knights was completed.</p><p dir="ltr">[The King&apos;s Knights Lv1]&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">[Knight Leader: - ]</p><p dir="ltr">[Knight Personnel: &#xA0;0/2]&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">[Knight Skills Lv1]&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">[Knights Protection Lv1: Health of the knights will increase by 5%]&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">[Nurtured Knights]&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">[ - ]</p><p dir="ltr">[Special Skill]&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&#xA0;[Call Lv1: -You can summon the leader of the knights. (Once every three days)]</p><p dir="ltr">&#x2018;Ohhh?&#x2019;</p><p dir="ltr">It was similar to an online game guild. No, it was much better.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&#x2018;The knight skill isn&#x2019;t a problem.&#x2019;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">The members of the group of knights would have their health increased by 5%. It was definitely a good option. It was still level one, so the effect would definitely get better. There was a possibility that new options would be added.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">However, there was something else that caught In-gong&#x2019;s eye.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">The nurtured knights.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">There wasn&#x2019;t a detailed explanation but he could guess by the name.</p><p dir="ltr">Nurturing the knights&#x2026; He could make them stronger!&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&#x2018;Call is also amazing.&#x2019;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">It could only be used once every three days, but there was unlimited potential in being able to call the leader of the knights.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&#x2018;If the number increases when it levels up, I might be able to summon general-level knights.&#x2019;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">In-gong&#x2019;s excitement grew as his imagination spread. However, Carack couldn&#x2019;t see the window of light and he thought In-gong was crazy.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">In-gong caught the gaze of his impudent subordinate number one. He then coughed and turned to face Carack.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&#x201C;Carack, there is something I want to suggest.&#x201D;</p><p dir="ltr">&#x201C;What is it?&#x201D;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Carack asked with wide eyes. In-gong felt strangely shy and spoke after a little bit.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;You- Would you like to keep moving forward with me?&#x201D;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Uh... are you asking me to be your direct subordinate? Just like those women called Seira and Delia?&#x201D;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;That&apos;s right. If you want to, I will ask Chris hyung if I can keep you.&#x201D;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">In fact, it was possible if he just asked Chris. In-gong had built up quite a lot of merits, so he could do as he wanted.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">However, In-gong wanted to respect Carack&#x2019;s will as much as possible. It was a relationship that needed to be maintained in the future.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&#x2018;Although, what will happen if he refuses?&#x2019;</p><p dir="ltr">In-gong stared at Carack with uneasy eyes. Carack scratched his chin and replied,&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Well, okay. I like Prince as well.&#x201D;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">It was fortunate that he agreed. In-gong laughed and told Carack,&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&#x201C;Okay, then fall to your knees. A simple ceremony is needed.&#x201D;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">In order to use The King&apos;s Knights skill properly, it was necessary to &#x2018;appoint&#x2019; a knight. Just like when he took control of the Thunder Light Anvil, the method popped into his head.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Carack fell to his knees in front of In-gong without any complaints. In-gong took out a dwarf sword from the inventory.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Uh, how can I rebel against Prince?&#x201D;</p><p dir="ltr">Carack leaned back as In-gong suddenly pulled out a short sword. In-gong clicked his tongue and approached Carack.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&#x201C;Don&#x2019;t worry. I am going to make you a knight. Just stay calm and cool.&#x201D;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Uhh, I will trust you.&#x201D;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Carack was as gentle as a sheep. He kneeled down but he wasn&#x2019;t that much shorter than In-gong. In-gong raised the sword to each shoulder and said,&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;The mighty orc warrior Carack, I appoint you as my knight.&#x201D;</p><p dir="ltr">It was a simple ceremony but the effect was obvious. As soon as he finished speaking, a white light wrapped around Carack&#x2019;s body.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&#x201C;Ohhh?&#x201D;</p><p dir="ltr">It was a little different from Below the King&#x2019;s Flag. The light was much larger and brighter.</p><p dir="ltr">[The King&apos;s Knights Lv1]&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">[Knight Leader: Carack]&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">[Knight Personnel: 1/2]&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">[Knights&#x2019; Personal Information]&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">[Carack Lv24 (Rank: Soldier)]&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">[Nurtured Knights]&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">[Carack Lv24 (Rank: Soldier)]&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">There was only one person, so appointing him to a position wasn&#x2019;t necessary. In-gong smiled happily at the Nurtured Knights section.</p><p dir="ltr">&#x2018;Is this achievement experience?&#x2019;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">If a certain amount of achievements were consumed, a person&#x2019;s stats could be raised or new skills could be obtained. Indeed, it was called a king&#x2019;s reward.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">In-gong formed tight fists as he thought of the rewards he could get from the achievements. He understood why there was the rank of &#x2018;soldier&#x2019; next to Carack&#x2019;s name.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Once he reached a certain level, his rank would be promoted. As far as chess was concerned, the pieces could be promoted through special rules (such as a pawn being upgraded to a queen or knight).&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&#x2018;Good, very good.&#x2019;</p><p dir="ltr">The most powerful orc he had seen in Knight Saga was the Orc Emperor, the pinnacle of all orcs. In-gong pictured Carack standing side by side with the Orc Emperor.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&#x201C;Excuse me, Prince. Is everything alright?&#x201D;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Carack&#x2019;s voice pulled In-gong back to reality. In-gong closed all the skill windows and nodded.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Yes, for now.&#x201D;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&#x201C;Umm, it is a strange feeling. I was enveloped in a white light and could only think of my loyalty to Prince.&#x201D;</p><p dir="ltr">&apos;That&apos;s great.&#x2019;</p><p dir="ltr">The words weren&#x2019;t bad.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&apos;I should increase the personnel in the group of knights quickly. Knights are preferred.&#x2019;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">In-gong was reminded of Caitlin for a moment but quickly shook his head. The position would be like Seira and Delia.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&apos;In fact, the most attractive one is Vandal.&#x2019;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">He had obtained Vandal when playing Zephyr.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Something he wanted to put his hands on Vandal again.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&apos;Yes, someday.&apos;</p><p dir="ltr">In-gong&#x2019;s resolution hardened after obtaining Carack. Thanks to discovering the armoury straight away, not much time had passed. Caitlin and Felicia would be sleeping for a while, so it was now time to look around the dungeon.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Let&apos;s go to the next room.&quot;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Carack followed In-gong without saying anything.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&amp;</p><p dir="ltr">Unfortunately, he didn&#x2019;t find anything good in the other rooms. Moreover, he needed to leave a share for Caitlin and Felicia, so In-gong only took a few dwarf weapons and armour, as well as Earth Quaker.</p><p dir="ltr">&apos;Will it be more expensive after thousands of years?&#x2019;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Of course, that was under the premise that they weren&#x2019;t damaged.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Once In-gong and Carack returned, Seira, who had been looking after Felicia and Caitlin, got up.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&#x201C;You&#x2019;ve come back? I was worried.&#x201D;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Uh, thank you. There wasn&#x2019;t anything special.&#x201D;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Seira&#x2019;s reaction was a little surprising, but he always welcomed it from a beauty.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&#x2018;Wait, she was worried about something else?&#x2019;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Seira&#x2019;s gaze was directed towards the dwarf armour that Carack was wearing. In-gong realized the reason behind the scene.</p><p dir="ltr">&#x2018;Ah, that&#x2019;s it.&#x2019;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Caitlin was part of the group that discovered this ruin. In other words, some of the finds inside the ruin belonged to Caitlin.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&#x2018;If I take too much, Caitlin will lose her share.&#x2019;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">He felt a little bit of regret, but he also felt good. Seira was truly loyal to Caitlin.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&#x2018;I wish for Carack to be the same.&#x2019;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Following that thought, In-gong&#x2019;s gaze moved to Carack&#x2019;s almost empty bag.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;There was nothing surprising. There is enough for my noonas. So I took this armour from the armoury.&#x201D;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;You found the armoury?&#x201D;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Seira&#x2019;s face became animated. In-gong grinned and nodded.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Yes, there were many things.&#x201D;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Due to In-gong&#x2019;s conscience, he didn&#x2019;t collect all the equipment in the armoury. He left 30% of the total amount.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&apos;Umm, it is a small prick.&#x2019;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">However, now wasn&#x2019;t the time to be brazen. In-gong knocked on the armour that Carack was wearing and said.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;This armour will be part of my share in the official distribution. I will give it to Carack.&#x201D;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&#x201C;You will give it to Carack?&#x201D;</p><p dir="ltr">&#x201C;Yes, he is my number one subordinate.&#x201D;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">After In-gong&#x2019;s words, Seira stared at Carack with a little bit of envy. Carack just accepted Seira&#x2019;s glance with a smile.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Anyway... How is the situation with the two of them?&#x201D;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Their stamina is depleted, so they need to rest a little bit longer. We will stay here today and leave early tomorrow morning.&#x201D;</p><p dir="ltr">Anyway, the Red Lightning tribe was already in a state of collapse. There was no reason for fugitives to run here, so it was a safe place.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Okay, let&apos;s do so.&quot; The fight is already won, so there is no need to overdo it.&#x201D;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Chris would be worried but it was unavoidable.</p><p dir="ltr">&#x2018;He already knows that we have succeeded.&#x2019;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">It was only a day or two, so he could wait that long.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Prince, I will prepare the camp now.&#x201D;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Carack said while taking off the cumbersome armour. In-gong just nodded.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&amp;</p><p dir="ltr">As expected, Felicia and Caitlin turned a blind eye to Carack&#x2019;s armour after waking up the next morning.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">In fact, they weren&#x2019;t greedy over the artifacts in the ruin.</p><p dir="ltr">Just like in the dwarf cave, Caitlin wasn&#x2019;t worried about the merits and was more upset that she couldn&#x2019;t break the cliff. On the other hand, Felicia was focused on the anvil.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&#x201C;I am sorry that there are only a few artifacts, but there are other things. There is a huge income, starting from the Thunder Light Anvil and the arc golem. This is really a great discovery!&#x201D;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Caitlin&#x2019;s eyes shone.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&#x2018;There is no need for me to worry.&#x2019;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">He felt full of energy like it was a spring day. So, In-gong decided to worry about Caitlin.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&#x201C;Is your body okay?&#x201D;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Yes, I felt better after waking up. Shutra, what about you?&#x201D;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Me too.&#x201D;</p><p dir="ltr">The two people gazed at each other with warm expressions before being summoned by an excited Felicia on a phantom steed. In order to explore the ruin some more, Felicia didn&#x2019;t want to go back. However, she realized that she couldn&#x2019;t be foolish and had to return.</p><p dir="ltr">Due to the reversal of the losing battle, Chris and Vandal&#x2019;s base was filled with vitality.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">As soon as he was informed that In-gong&#x2019;s party was approaching, Chris leapt out of the tent and welcomed them with open arms.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&#x201C;Oh! These lucky people!&#x201D;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Chris rushed over to the phantom steeds. The first thing he did was hug Caitlin then In-gong tightly.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&#x2018;Keook!&#x2019;</p><p dir="ltr">Due to the fact that Chris was big and powerful, the hug itself was close to torture. However, it was still quite a good feeling. Chris released In-gong and headed towards Felicia, but he stopped short just before hugging her.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;You did great work, Noonim.&#x201D;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Chris greeted her with both arms in an awkward position. Felicia, who shuddered like she was a little afraid he would hug her, grinned at him.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Well, it was nothing because I am me.&#x201D;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">She lifted her chin with the arrogance of a princess but her words weren&#x2019;t over yet.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Shutra and Caitlin helped me a lot.&#x201D;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Although her voice was smaller than before, she definitely mentioned them.</p><p dir="ltr">&#x2018;Her ears are red.&#x2019;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">In-gong just smiled while Caitlin alternated between looking at Chris and Felicia.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;It is good to see Prince and the Princesses.&#x201D;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Vandal simply summarized the situation and Felicia nodded in response. Chris laughed and spoke to In-gong and Caitlin.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Take a break. I will take care of all the chores.&#x201D;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;What chores? Wasn&#x2019;t the Red Lightning tribe swept up?&#x201D;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">In a game, it was the end after defeating the enemy. However, reality was different. Moreover, there were still leaders in the Red Lightning tribe such as Kairam.</p><p dir="ltr">Chris replied to In-gong&#x2019;s question,</p><p dir="ltr">&#x201C;There are still things like the swamp monsters. We have to negotiate with the lizardmen.&#x201D;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">The lizardmen attacked the expedition along with the Red Lightning tribe. It couldn&#x2019;t be allowed to continue.</p><p dir="ltr">&#x201C;It will take more than a fortnight to finish. Troops will then be stationed here to take care of the Red Lightning tribe.&#x201D;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Chris looked briefly at Vandal&#x2019;s army that would be left here and asked Felicia.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&#x201C;Noonim, what will you do now?&#x201D;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">In-gong didn&#x2019;t understand the question but Felicia replied without hesitation.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&#x201C;Well, shouldn&#x2019;t I follow you? I have to report the discovery and use of the anvil.&#x201D;</p><p dir="ltr">&#x201C;I will be returning with Caitlin.&#x201D;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">In-gong was now able to understand what the two of them were talking about.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">The Red Lightning tribe mission has been accomplished. There was only one thing left to do:&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Return to the castle to receive the rewards for the merits.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">It was a return to the Demon King&#x2019;s Palace.</p><hr><p><br></p><p><br></p></div><p><br></p>
