<p><span>Chapter 177 - Chapter 35: Battle #4</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p><p><span>In-gong gulped. If it was as he thought... that meant the illness of the demon king had worsened, and he had collapsed.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&apos;So fast.&apos;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>In Knight Saga, the worsening of the demon king&#x2019;s illness and the cancellation of the court gathering had occurred in Year 516. It was currently Year 513, so it should&#x2019;ve occurred three years in the future.&#xA0;</span><span>However, he couldn&#x2019;t deny it. Things had already changed quite a bit from Knight Saga. Just looking at Zephyr, he was much stronger now compared to how he had been in Knight Saga.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&#x2018;The court gatherings haven&#x2019;t been abolished yet.&#x2019;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>It had been cancelled just once. There was currently no need to assign a substitution like the demon king had done in Year 517.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Shutra? Have you guessed something?&quot;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>Felicia asked suddenly. It was because In-gong was thinking with a very serious expression on his face.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>All gazes shifted toward In-gong, who shook his head hurriedly.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&quot;No, no. I don&#x2019;t know.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>It wasn&#x2019;t a complete lie. The cancellation of the court gathering might not be because of the demon king&#x2019;s illness. Maybe it was something else which In-gong didn&#x2019;t know.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&apos;I&#x2019;d rather be wrong.&#x2019;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>The demon king had to stay alive. The longer his reign was, the more time In-gong had to prepare.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Did something happen to Abamama?&#x201D;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>Felicia said in an uneasy voice. Just like how 3rd Queen Sylvia truly loved the demon king, Felicia loved her father as well. They really were a loving family.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;It can&#x2019;t be.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>Chris denied the possibility immediately. It wasn&#x2019;t simply because he didn&#x2019;t want to hear such ominous words. It was because he couldn&#x2019;t imagine a situation where anything was wrong with the demon king.&#xA0;</span><span>For the children of the demon king, the demon king was an absolute being.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>In-gong looked at other possibilities. Maybe it was a problem with the queens, not the demon king, which caused the court gathering to be cancelled.&#xA0;</span><span>However, the possibility of that was low. From the beginning, the queens weren&#x2019;t essential for the court gatherings.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&#x2018;Is it truly the demon king&#x2019;s sickness?&#x2019;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>The moment that he thought so...&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>A heavy wind blew past. Everyone, including In-gong, turned reflexively. There was a strong presence they couldn&#x2019;t resist.&#xA0;</span><span>The sword duke was on the terrace, but it wasn&#x2019;t like when he had showed up two days ago. The sword duke&#x2019;s face was blank.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>Silvan opened his mouth, but he couldn&#x2019;t speak. Chris was the same. The strong aura of the sword duke dominated the surrounding area completely.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Prince, you have to go somewhere with me right now. This isn&#x2019;t an offer but a command of the demon king.&quot;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>The sword duke ordered. The children of the demon king gulped at the sword duke&#x2019;s brief speech.&#xA0;</span><span>Where was he going? And why did the sword duke look so serious? Was it related to why the court gathering had been cancelled?&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;I understand.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>In-gong replied calmly. At that moment, Felicia tried to take a step toward In-gong, in order to go with him as always.&#xA0;</span><span>However, the sword duke didn&#x2019;t allow it. He instantly stopped everyone&#x2019;s movements, including Felicia. Felicia couldn&#x2019;t breathe. It felt like she was frozen by something. They were caught in the absolute power of the sword duke.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;It is only 9th Prince.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>The declaration was like an absolute rule. Felicia gasped for breath, while Caitlin and Chris couldn&#x2019;t say anything. Silvan clenched his teeth and staggered toward Felicia.&#xA0;</span><span>The sword duke was no longer looking at the children of the demon king. He only looked at In-gong as he spoke,</span></p><p><span>&quot;Prince, excuse me for a moment.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>The sword duke moved in front of In-gong instantly and raised a hand to his shoulder. In-gong accepted the sword duke&#x2019;s hand instead of resisting. He looked back at the restrained Carack before taking a deep breath.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>Once again, a heavy wind blew past. No, it was better to say that wind was broken.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>The sword duke&#x2019;s technique transcended imagination. As he held onto In-gong&#x2019;s shoulder, he crossed a vast distance in one step.&#xA0;</span><span>The sword duke only stopped when they arrived at a transportation formation.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>In-gong reflexively used the mini-map to check his location. They seemed to be near the Black Castle.&#xA0;</span><span>The sword duke didn&#x2019;t explain as he triggered the transportation formation. Instead of asking, In-gong followed the sword duke onto the transportation formation.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>The place where they arrived was inside a cave. It was an artificially enlarged natural cave, with a sura boy and girl standing in front of the transportation formation.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>The sura boy and girl, dressed in the same clothes as the sword duke, were surprised to see In-gong next to the sword duke. However, that only lasted for a moment. They started speaking to the sword duke with desperate expressions. At first, In-gong couldn&#x2019;t understand, but he soon realized. It was the sura&#x2019;s native language.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&#x2018;Is the Holy Land in danger?&#x2019;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>Was this the sura&#x2019;s sanctuary?&#xA0;</span><span>The sword duke interrupted the boy&#x2019;s story. He looked at In-gong and said,</span></p><p><span>&quot;Prince, you will now be entering the Holy Land. It can also be called the Sanctuary.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Is this the sanctuary of the sura?&#x201D;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>The sword duke had mentioned earlier that his residence was the Sanctuary. In that case, did the sura have a problem? Perhaps the cancellation of the court gathering had something to do with the sura.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;There is no time. I will explain while moving.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>The sword duke turned around and started to run. It was fast because they were moving a long distance, but it wasn&#x2019;t like when he moved at the Demon King&#x2019;s Palace.&#xA0;</span><span>In-gong hurriedly caught up with the sword duke using Protection of the Wind. The sword duke watched In-gong closely before smiling and explaining,&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&#x2018;It is true that the place where I stay is the sanctuary of the sura. But it isn&#x2019;t just a sanctuary for the sura. It can be called the sanctuary of the whole Demon World.&#x2019;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>The sword duke&#x2019;s voice was directly conveyed into In-gong&#x2019;s head. It was a technique using aura, not message magic.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>[Trill Lv1 has been learnt.]&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>He was happy to learn an unexpected skill, but now wasn&#x2019;t the time to look at it.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&apos;My mission is to protect the Sanctuary. It is a lifelong task inherited from my master.&#x2019;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>The Sanctuary had been protected for generations.&#xA0;</span><span>The sword duke continued to speak,&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&#x2018;Very few people know the location of the Sanctuary. Only a few of the queens and captains know the location. Even they don&#x2019;t know the true role of the Sanctuary. The Sanctuary isn&#x2019;t simply the home of the sura.&#x2019;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>The reason for the Sanctuary&#x2019;s location being known to some was to prepare for possible attacks.&#xA0;</span><span>However, according to the sword duke&#x2019;s words, it wasn&#x2019;t just for that. From the beginning, the Sanctuary had been a shield to cover something else.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>The sword duke briefly stopped talking there. He then changed the topic instead of explaining the true role of the Sanctuary.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&apos;The Sanctuary is now under attack. Prince will fight with me.&#x2019;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>There was always a reason for the demon king&#x2019;s actions. He didn&#x2019;t order the 9th Prince to go somewhere for no reason.&#xA0;</span><span>The sword duke ran along a snowy field with In-gong. Snowy mountains rose like a wall in the distance.&#xA0;</span><span>In-gong opened the mini-map, but he couldn&#x2019;t figure out his exact location. Even if the scale was increased as much as possible, only the snowy field could be seen.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Prince, do you remember what I said before? The Demon King&#x2019;s Palace has always faced challenges.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>The sword duke said abruptly. At that moment, In-gong felt the wind disappear. The snowy field he had been running on suddenly changed to grassland.&#xA0;</span><span>In-gong realized that he had just passed through a ward.&#xA0;</span><span>In-gong&#x2019;s gaze moved to a place far away. At the far end, a huge silver tower in the shape of a dome could be seen. Additionally, a fight was about to start on both sides.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;This is one of those challenges. A pretty big challenge.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>The sword duke growled. In-gong gulped as he concentrated aura on both eyes and looked at the battlefield. He saw a familiar sight.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&#x2018;Creature Abseltur!&#x2019;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>He was a formidable adversary which In-gong had always encountered when playing the role of Locke in Knight Saga.&#xA0;</span><span>Abseultur took on the appearance of a dark elf, instead of a huge creature, and was sitting on a carriage pulled by two chimeras. On his left and right, there were hundreds of blood warriors who seemed to come from hell.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&#x2018;It isn&#x2019;t just Abseltur.&#x2019;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>In the opposite direction was Arch Lich Shutenberg. He was the creator of Zephyr&#x2019;s subordinate, Sektum, and as an undead commander, he was more difficult than Abseltur in many ways.&#xA0;</span><span>In-gong took a deep breath. He felt a fighting spirit instead of fear. The sword duke was here, and In-gong was much stronger than he had been in Evian.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&#x2018;Master! The enemy!&#x2019;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>Green Wind exclaimed suddenly. In-gong looked up to see birds the size of a human body staring at him from the air.&#xA0;</span><span>It seemed like they were Abseltur&#x2019;s scouts which he had spread all over the battlefield.</span><span>This was just before the battle, but there was still a considerable distance to the battlefield. In-gong sent White Eagle after them. He couldn&#x2019;t allow their position to be exposed.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>White Eagle shot forward and took care of the low-grade creatures in an instant.&#xA0;</span><span>It was at this moment that...&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>[Your level has risen.]&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Eh?&#x201D;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>In-gong cried out unintentionally. He had gained a lot of experience from defeating Berkintox and Artman, so he had expected to level up sooner or later. However, he didn&#x2019;t think it would happen just before a fight like this.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>However, In-gong felt glad. Levelling up was always useful. Moreover, this level up had a different meaning.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&#x2018;Level 40!&#x2019;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>He could upgrade an existing occupation or obtain a new secondary occupation!&#xA0;</span><span>Confronted with such strong enemies, it really was appropriate timing.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>[You are at the junction of growth. Please select one of the following two paths.]&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>[Species Change: Dragon]&#xA0;</span></p><p>[Ancestral Regression: Divine Humanoid Gandharva]</p><p><span>The female voice rang out as letters of light appeared in front of him. It was an option for species selection, not occupation.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&apos;Divine Humanoid Gandharva? &apos;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>According to legend, the Eight Legions were divine beings living in the heavens. It was highly likely he would awaken that divine power due to ancestral regression.&#xA0;</span><span>In-gong didn&#x2019;t think about it for long. He didn&#x2019;t have time to worry, but it also wasn&#x2019;t a matter to worry about in the first place.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>He was arguably already a half-dragon. So, In-gong didn&#x2019;t feel the need to change his species to a dragon.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>[You have chosen Ancestral Regression: Divine Humanoid Gandharva.] &#xA0;</span></p><p><span>[Ancestral regression has started.]&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>The clear voice was cut off. Simultaneously, a white light whirled around In-gong&#x2019;s body. This white light couldn&#x2019;t be compared to the light of blessing which appeared every time he levelled up.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Prince?!&#x201D;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>The sword duke, who had been staring at Abseltur and Lich Shutenberg, let out a confused sound. It wasn&#x2019;t because Shutra was suddenly surrounded by a white light.&#xA0;</span><span>The sword duke recalled the moment when Divine Sura Authority had been born. It felt like that time&#x2026; It was a nice and creepy feeling which sent a shiver down his spine.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>In the midst of the light, In-gong shrieked soundlessly. His whole body was hot, and a terrible pain seemed to be tearing his body apart as his head turned white.&#xA0;</span><span>Green Wind shouted. Then he could hear the voice of the white woman.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>In-gong forgot about the flow of time. He raised his head and roared loudly. The white light covering In-gong&#x2019;s entire body shot up into the sky.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>[Four Heavenly Kings: Dhrtarastra Spirit has been acquired.]&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>[Heavenly Wine Lv1 has been learnt.]&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>[Divine Scent Lv1 has been learnt.]&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>[Pheromones Lv1 has been learnt.]&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>[Divinity Lv1 has been learnt.]&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>[The level of divine power has risen.]&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>[The level of divine power has risen.]&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>[The level of divine power has risen.]&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>[Protagonist Correction is activated.] &#xA0;</span></p><p><span>[Protagonist Body is activated.] &#xA0;</span></p><p><span>[The divine power of the last flame and the divine power of the Four Heavenly Kings have become one.]&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>[The level of Divinity has risen.]&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>One of the Four Heavenly Kings, the deity of the gandharva who protected the east&#x2026; His blood flowed through In-gong&#x2019;s body.&#xA0;</span><span>In-gong opened his eyes slowly. He didn&#x2019;t need to check his status window.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>All his gandharva attributes had been strengthened. In-gong had been reborn as a divine humanoid with his own divinity.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>Conquest and Protagonist Body had joined forces. The divine power of the last flame and one of the Four Heavenly Kings had been combined to create a sacred white flame.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&#x2018;Master! Are you okay? Master has changed! You have become divine! A-and... more handsome?&#x2019;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>In-gong smiled at Green Wind&#x2019;s admiration. He mounted White Eagle on his left arm and looked in front of him.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>The sword duke stared at In-gong before laughing. Instead of asking what happened, he just noticed that In-gong had become stronger.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Prince, I will entrust the east to you.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>The sword duke raced toward the west where Lich Shutenberg was. A number of senior undead were guarding Shutenberg, but they were nothing against the sword duke. So, there was no need to worry.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>In-gong stared in the direction of Creature Abseltur. Some of the blood warriors around Abseltur noticed the abnormality and turned to this side.&#xA0;</span><span>As In-gong closed his eyes before opening them again, the half-solid Green Wind appeared beside him.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&#x2018;Master.&#x2019;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>Green Wind said, and In-gong nodded. Rather than taking out the flag of light, he raised his hand to Green Wind. She was imbued with the power of Conquest.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&#x2018;Apostle Appointment, Green Wind.&#x2019;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>The white light surrounded Green Wind, and her power was increased by several times.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>The small reindeer horns on Green Wind&#x2019;s head grew much bigger. Her green hair was lengthened, and instead of clothes made of leaves and stems, she was wearing a white dress of light. The Conquest Coat of Arms on her forehead was clear.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>The divine power around her was more than what he had felt when he first encountered her on Enger Plains. It wasn&#x2019;t an exaggeration to call Green Wind a goddess of the wind.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&#x2018;Master.&#x2019;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>Green Wind kissed In-gong&#x2019;s lips. After giving him a high class blessing and smiling shyly, she became the wind. In addition to White Eagle, she too stayed beside In-gong.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>In-gong took a deep breath, then he rushed toward Abseltur&#x2019;s army.&#xA0;</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p>
