I&#x2019;ve never seen Spider Forest look this way.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Robin spoke politely to Carack as he had done throughout the journey as Carack was an orc who was shockingly informal when talking to the prince and princess. The armour he wore was so great that Robin mistook him for someone with a noble status.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Seira added,</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Are there any regular patrols in this area?&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">The lycanthrope rangers patrolled the outskirts of the lycanthrope area at regular intervals, so Robin nodded.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;It isn&#x2019;t everyday, but the rangers will pass by here once a month.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;When was the last time the rangers passed by here?&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">This time it was Delia who asked.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Robin counted the date in his head and stuttered,</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;Eh... We can&#x2019;t reach the rangers headquarters unless we pass Spider Forest... Considering the amount of time it takes to move and the last time the rangers have been here, it should be 10 days to a fortnight.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">A fortnight was definitely not a short period. However, it was too short to change the distribution of animals in certain areas.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;This is a recent change. It is abrupt.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Felicia muttered and looked around again. She could feel a powerful energy even without focusing on the flow of magic.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">As Robin had said, if there had been no big changes until 10 days ago, then it had to be a coincidence that their visit coincided with the changes in Spider Forest.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Carack asked with a serious expression,</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Don&apos;t worry. Can we really blame Prince? This is Prince&#x2019;s trademark.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">In-gong couldn&#x2019;t sense the difference, but Carack seemed to think it was good. Carack nodded with a laugh while In-gong looked at Daphne. She a was druid and a dryad, so she would be most sensitive to these kind of changes.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">While the party was exchanging stories, she closed her eyes and tried to communicate with the surrounding spirits. Then she spoke with a pale face,</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;The surrounding spirits are very afraid. It is more about fear for the future than a sudden change in circumstances.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Daphne looked at Karma and Karma nodded as well.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Fear is mixed in with the cries of the beasts. It isn&#x2019;t just a threatening cry. Some are terrified.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Intermittent roars could be heard from the depths of the forest. He didn&#x2019;t know if they were fighting each other, but maybe there truly was a different cause.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Everyone&#x2019;s expressions became serious. Felicia turned to In-gong and asked,</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;The person called Amita, are they strong?&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Although she knew they were unusual because they were a friend of the sword duke, she couldn&#x2019;t help feeling uneasy.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">In-gong was also forced to give an uncertain answer,</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Let&apos;s hope so.&quot;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">In Knight Saga, Amita had always appeared with a difference appearance. In the past, Amita had appeared as a big man who looked strong but also a thin woman and a cute little boy.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Right now, he had Caitlin as an example, so it was impossible to evaluate attack power based on appearance alone. In the end, it was impossible to guess how much strength, skill and abilities Amita had.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&apos;They have lived for a long time, but that isn&#x2019;t unconditional.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Moreover, there was a law that prevented the existence of a great craftsmen and great warrior in one individual.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">While In-gong and Felicia had a silent conversation, Caitlin, who had been listening quietly, opened her mouth.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Shutra, this is outside the lycanthrope territory, but it isn&#x2019;t that far. I think that it would be a good idea to ask for support, rather than try to resolve it ourselves.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Although she was quite curious about Amita, she was a princess of the lycanthropes.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Felicia nodded in agreement to her statement.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">However, there was someone who opposed this.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;It is too late.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">It was Green Wind. Robin was amazed by her sudden appearance. However, the party had already seen Green Wind several times, so they were more interested in her words.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Carack asked first,</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;It is too late. What does that mean?&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Instead of answering, Green Wind just frowned slightly. However, it wasn&#x2019;t because she wasn&#x2019;t offended by Carack&#x2019;s question but because the energy around Spider Forest was having a detrimental effect on her.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Green Wind hugged herself and looked at In-gong.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;I can feel the power of the guardian. It is very weak. The spirits are just afraid of the monsters. They are afraid that the guardian of Spider Forest will disappear.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">It was Green Wind, the guardian of Enger Plains, who was saying this. Felicia asked Robin hurriedly,</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;Robin, does Spider Forest have a guardian? A guardian that protects the area.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Caitlin didn&#x2019;t know a lot about the outside territory, so she didn&#x2019;t know much about Spider Forest.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Robin searched through his memories with a confused expression before clapping his hands.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;There is a story of a spider spirit. It is a story about a giant spider living in the centre of Spider Forest.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">There was no such thing as proper faith.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">In-gong nodded thoughtfully. Nothing special had occurred at Spider Forest in Knight Saga. Moreover, there were no tribes living nearby, so the situation was different from Green Wind who was worshiped by the centaurs and satyrs.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Regardless, Green Wind had said it, so the existence of the guardian was certain.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Carack asked Green Wind,</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Anyway, what will happen if the guardian spirit disappears?&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Carack&#x2019;s question pulled at the core of the story. Green Wind seemed to find it difficult to answer and Felicia suddenly opened her mouth,</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;If the guardian disappears, it is a problem. But how does it disappear?&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Everyone&#x2019;s gazes moved toward Felicia. She raised her index finger and explained,</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;There are two main ways that a guardian can disappear. One is that the guardian spirit itself is destroyed while the other is that the source of the spirit is destroyed.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">In-gong was reminded of the small temple on Enger Plains. Green Wind had said that Enger Plains would lose its colours and revert back if she disappeared.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Felicia presented the answer like she had read In-gong&#x2019;s mind.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Green Wind is a higher ranked guardian. So, even if the source disappears, she won&#x2019;t. Her strength is likely to just weaken.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Karma had a heartbroken look on her face at those words, but no one witnessed it.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Green Wind just shrugged in response.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Hmm, hmm.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x2018;Now, you know. Master should take care of me more,&#x2019; was what her expression seemed to be saying.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">In-gong looked away from Green Wind and shifted toward Felicia, who laughed and continued her explanation,</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;But most guardians are destroyed when the source is. Most of them are cases that I have encountered before in ruins or dungeons.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Since Felicia had many experiences exploring ruins, no one expressed any disagreement.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Caitlin frowned and asked,</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Unni, are you saying that the guardian of Spider Forest is weakened due to the source itself being hit?&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;Perhaps.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;It is accurate. I also think so.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Green Wind nodded with a serious expression and spread her arms wide open.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;This is the first time I&#x2019;ve come here. The spirits are confused and frightened and they can&#x2019;t communicate properly, but I can feel it. There is powerful magic in the centre of that forest. Once the magic is destroyed, a big change will take place in the neighbourhood.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Like Enger Plains?&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">In-gong asked reflexively and Green Wind nodded.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;Master broke through the crisis on Enger Plains, but that would have been the case if Master hadn&#x2019;t appeared. Enger Plains would have been turned into a desert. I don&#x2019;t know what magic is in the centre of the forest, but if it is similar to Enger Plains, the area may become a desert or wilderness.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Robin&#x2019;s face became speculative when he heard the word &#x2018;desert&#x2019;. Green Wind continued to speak,</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;There isn&#x2019;t enough time to call for support from somewhere else. The power of the guardian spirit is too weak. If we wait for support, we might miss the timing.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">It had taken In-gong&#x2019;s group a few days to reach Spider Forest. However, when considering the round distance travel, it would take at least three days for support to arrive.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">In-gong stared at Spider Forest. Firstly, they had to confirm the identity of the enemy.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;On Enger Plains, the monsters of the Northern Limit Line came down directly. What monsters are gathered in the forest to attack the guardian?&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;I don&#x2019;t know the answer to that. Maybe something like a powerful curse is weakening the guardian.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;In the end, we have to go into the center of the forest.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Outside the forest, they couldn&#x2019;t do anything other than guess.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">In-gong was reminded of the Death Knight. If this was a repeat of what had happened on Enger Plains, then it was likely that the Death Knight was involved.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x2018;The purple aura.&#x2019;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">It had been wrapped around the monsters in the north. Additionally, the man with the spear had a blue aura which contained a power of death that was one step higher.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;E-excuse me.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Karma interrupted suddenly, raising her hand slightly when In-gong glanced at her.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;I know we don&#x2019;t have time, but I think it will be hard to explore the forest right now.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Her words were correct. There was a clear basis for them and Daphne agreed with Karma&#x2019;s words.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Your Highness, the spirits are afraid of the night. It is clear that something will happen at night.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Green Wind nodded to confirm it.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Felicia bit her lip and asked,</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Can we get to the center before that?&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;We won&#x2019;t arrive that quickly. It is already late afternoon.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Carack pointed to the sky; the sun was close to the west.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Okay, then we will set up camp nearby. We will put off going into the forest until tomorrow morning.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Although In-gong was responsible for Thunderdoom Fortress, Felicia was in charge of the visit to Spider Forest.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;The most important things are our lives. We shouldn&#x2019;t run away, but it isn&#x2019;t worth doubling the risk.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">It was true that she wanted to meet Amita. As a child of the demon king, she had no desire to leave the forest.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">However, the lives of In-gong and Caitlin were more precious. Felicia made a clear statement, then asked In-gong,</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Shutra, can I give Karma some work?&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">In-gong turned to Karma and Karma immediately responded to his gaze,</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;I will follow your words.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">In-gong looked back at Felicia. She accepted it as permission and told Karma,</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;It is important to inform the lycanthropes of the current situation. Robin has to guide us in Spider Forest, so Karma will tell them the news. I believe in your quick feet and strong heart.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;I understand.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Karma replied with a determined expression. Felicia smiled and tried to relax.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;I&apos;ll write you a letter, so just wait a moment. Does Green Wind agree with camping?&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Understood.</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;Yes, I agree. I am sorry for the guardian of this land, but Master is more precious.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Green Wind scattered back to wind.
