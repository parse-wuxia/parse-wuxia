Although, there had been a few times when he had been filled with exhaustion after the battle was over, yet still had to clean everything up. Even when he fought Gerard, he had lost consciousness only when the battle was fully completed.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&apos;I should invest more points in durability and persistence... No, it is an aura problem, so I should raise the level of Aura.&#x2019;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">His mind cleared up and he could now feel the warmth that was right beside him.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">In-gong turned his head sideways. As expected, Caitlin was sleeping serenely next to him.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Felicia and Carack knew the effects of the Moonlight Core and Starlight Core, so they were holding hands like they had done at the lycanthrope house.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">There was a dark orange light, so he couldn&#x2019;t see Caitlin&#x2019;s face clearly, but she was very calm. In-gong&#x2019;s heart warmed as he gazed at her.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x2018;Shutra as well.&#x2019;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Caitlin had said it.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">He was sorry for having squeezed out her aura so forcefully, but she looked cute.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x2018;Relax, relax.&#x2019;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">In-gong took a deep breath and raised his upper body. However, there was someone attacking In-gong&#x2019;s upper body.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x2018;Master, you&#x2019;re awake!&#x2019;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">As expected, it was Green Wind. Green Wind hugged In-gong&#x2019;s upper body tightly. The weight felt good and he turned to face her, stroking her head with his free left hand.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;Well, well. Yes, yes. Whoa, whoa.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">It felt similar to how he soothed Maybach. Then Green Wind complained,</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Your treatment seems different from usual, but it feels good. Continue, Master.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">It wasn&#x2019;t possible to see Green Wind&#x2019;s expression since her head was buried in In-gong&#x2019;s neck, but he could tell what the expression was.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">In-gong laughed and patted Green Wind&#x2019;s back slowly.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;Yes, yes. Well done. It was clever to trick the guardian with your green light.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">He whispered proper praise into her ears. Then Green Wind raised her body and gazed at In-gong. She said with a big smile,</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Did you only just find that out? Nevertheless, Master is a good master. Praise my wits.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">She then burrowed herself in In-gong&#x2019;s arms again.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">1,000 years of solitude was scary. Or was this perhaps just her natural personality?</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">In the end, In-gong couldn&#x2019;t control his laughter as he kept stroking Green Wind&#x2019;s back. The texture of her long hair felt good.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;Yes, yes. Well, well. Nice, kind.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">It was good that Maybach was at the Demon King&#x2019;s Palace right now.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">In-gong had the mischievous thought as he held the beauty in his arms and looked around the room.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">The walls, ceiling and furniture were all gorgeous, but the room itself was quite narrow. In-gong and Caitlin were lying on a slightly large single bed that wasn&#x2019;t meant for two people.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Is this a room in Silvan&#x2019;s flying ship?&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Green Wind raised her body again at In-gong&#x2019;s words.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;You&#x2019;re so great, Master. How did you know?&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;I can&#x2019;t not know.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">In-gong pointed at the opposite wall and Green Wind quickly turned to look. There was a big portrait hanging on the white wall.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">The shiny silver hair, healthy brown skin, charming beauty and noble air...&#xA0;</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">However, the most noticeable things were the eye patch over the right eye and the plump feathered captain&#x2019;s hat.&#xA0;</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">The subject of the painting was posing in a very strong and uncomfortable posture.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x2018;It reminds me of Napoleon&#x2019;s portrait.&#x2019;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">In it, Silvan was wearing tight silk pants.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">In-gong looked away from the portrait towards Green Wind again.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;The others?&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Everybody is sleeping. The fight was only completed a few hours ago. It is now early morning. Felicia wanted to watch over my amazing master, but Felicia was also tired. She decided to rest based on my recommendation.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">There was one strange thing about the story.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;Amazing?&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">He guessed it was referring to him, but it was strange.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Green Wind replied with an unconcerned expression,</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Meeting you is amazing, amazing. Moreover, Master seems to feel very good when someone says amazing.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">It was undeniable. Green Wind turned briefly to look at the sleeping Caitlin, then leaned close to him with a bright face.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Master is amazing.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Despite it being said informally, its effect was great. In-gong cleared his throat as he felt his heart beating wildly.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Uhh, I won&#x2019;t deny it. However, please don&#x2019;t take Caitlin&#x2019;s identity.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;I don&#x2019;t know what you&#x2019;re talking about.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Green Wind laughed and raised her body. As she touched In-gong&#x2019;s shoulder, she became half-blurred.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Rest a little more, Master. Morning is still far away.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;Yes.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">The clock on the mini-map said that it was two in the morning. Like Green Wind had said, morning was still far away.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">In-gong lay back down on the bed and closed his eyes. He could feel Caitlin&#x2019;s warmth through his right hand as he fell deep asleep.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&amp;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Once again, I will introduce myself. I am 5th Prince Silvan Doomblade. As you can see, I am a prince of heaven who moves across the sky.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;It is truly shameful... but as you all know, he is my twin brother.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">The next morning...</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">In-gong and Caitlin washed up with the water Carack brought them and Felicia and Silvan came to visit them.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Silvan glanced at Felicia who looked ashamed and clicked his tongue.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;Felicia, don&#x2019;t be ashamed. As my sister, you also have my beauty and grace. So, you don&apos;t have to be ashamed of that. Stand proudly.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">He didn&#x2019;t know why she was ashamed, or maybe he was just ignoring reality.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;I&#x2019;d rather die.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Felicia covered her red face with a fan and took deep breaths. It seemed like Felicia received Silvan&#x2019;s share of shame. It was unfortunate that she couldn&#x2019;t lament it openly.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">In-gong closed his mouth as he tried to stop from laughing and Caitlin looked from Felicia to Silvan with curious eyes.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Felicia, who had barely recovered her composure, pointed at In-gong and Caitlin.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Caitlin and Shutra. Silvan, do you know them?&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Well, roughly. It has been a long time since I&#x2019;ve seen them up close.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Silvan gazed at In-gong and Caitlin. It could almost be seen as a displeased look.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">However, Caitlin greeted him with her normal bright face.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;It is nice to meet you, Silvan oppa.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;Nice to meet you too.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Unlike Felicia, he talked to Caitlin in a more formal way. It was the same for both In-gong and Caitlin. Compared to Felicia, it was harder for Silvan to act friendly with them.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Silvan&#x2019;s expression changed after they exchanged greetings. His eyes narrowed as he asked Caitlin,</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;How is Chris?&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">It was much smoother compared to when Chris mentioned Silvan, but it wasn&#x2019;t that intimate.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">However, Caitlin just smiled.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;He is very healthy. He&#x2019;s doing well.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;I- I see.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Silvan seemed confused by Caitlin&#x2019;s attitude. Felicia laughed at their conversation and raised a hand to Silvan&#x2019;s shoulder.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Silvan suddenly appeared because of me. While staying at the lycanthrope house, I used a long distance communication method and contacted him.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;Felicia noona?&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Yes, he told me that he would come see me. I thought it would take a long time because he was quite a distance away, but he arrived sooner than I expected.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">It was the reason she didn&#x2019;t mention Silvan when they had been worried about reinforcements for Spider Forest. Felicia thought that she wouldn&#x2019;t be able to meet Silvan until after two weeks.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Silvan pulled Felicia close and stroked her head.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Felicia was exhausted. I needed to charge over as quickly as possible. So, I flew like the wind to meet my beloved sister.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">She didn&#x2019;t feel any better despite his sweet voice. Chris loved Caitlin quite a lot, but it seemed like Silvan loved Felicia more. Felicia held back a sigh and said to Caitlin,</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;I&#x2019;m sorry about my brother. His screws are a bit loose, but he isn&#x2019;t a bad person. He is just a fool.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Caitlin nodded. In order to change the atmosphere, In-gong spoke to Silvan,</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;You were a big help in last night&#x2019;s battle. Thank you.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Although the first charge had been impulsive, Silvan&#x2019;s subsequent activities had been impressive. He had also taken care of everything after In-gong and Caitlin fainted.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Silvan raised an eyebrow at In-gong&#x2019;s appreciation, then replied with a bitter laugh,</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;I did my best, but... you played a more active role. You were amazing. I heard about it, but I honestly never imagined that you would be this great. It&#x2019;s amazing.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Isn&apos;t it? Didn&#x2019;t I tell you? Isn&#x2019;t our Shutra great?&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Felicia raised her chin as she exclaimed. Caitlin nodded in agreement.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;Shutra is amazing.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">If Chris had been there, he would have asked why the two people were saying it. However, this was Silvan.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Silvan simply shrugged and spoke to Felicia in a sad voice,</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;Felicia, this oppa is also great. If I take off this eyepatch...&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;I&#x2019;m sorry about my brother.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Felicia quickly cut off Silvan&#x2019;s words. However, Caitlin was curious.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Silvan oppa, what will happen if you take off that eyepatch?&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;Ahh.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Felicia lamented, but it was too late. Silvan laughed happily.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;It is good that you asked. This is a special object that suppresses my strength. If I remove this, my true strength will awaken. However, that power is dangerous, so I usually keep it suppressed.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;Wah!&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Caitlin let out a sound of admiration and Felicia blushed as she shook her head.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Caitlin, you should do it moderately.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;Huh? But it really is great. Very cool, Silvan oppa.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Silvan felt perplexed by Caitlin&#x2019;s heartfelt admiration. He then turned to ask In-gong a question,</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;That reminds me. Shutra, that technique you used&#x2014; Chris uses a similar one. Did you learn Beast Authority from the lycanthropes?&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Yes, I learnt the basics from Chris and Caitlin.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Our Shutra is amazing.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Felicia boasted about In-gong once more and Caitlin nodded again.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Even the sword duke praised his great talent.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;Wait, the sword duke?&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Silvan&#x2019;s expression changed instantly. He gazed at Felicia with a stiff expression.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;Felicia, what does that mean?&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Uh, well... that...&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Felicia seemed distressed as she avoided his gaze.
