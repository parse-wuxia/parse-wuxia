<p><span>Chapter 193 - Chapter 40: To the North #2</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p><p><span>&#x201C;So, why is there a bite?&#x201D;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Slightly, just slightly.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>In-gong avoided Carack&#x2019;s gaze and raised his finger. There was a clean lycanthrope bite on it.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>Although In-gong had agreed, his flesh was too hard for Caitlin at first. In-gong already had a durability figure which was over 100 points, so his skin was incomparable to Villager A.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>Carack looked at In-gong&#x2019;s wound with a surprised face and laughed.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&quot;You must have been surprised.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>In-gong had been bitten suddenly.&#xA0;</span><span>However, he just shook his head.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&quot;I think Caitlin noona was even more surprised. She did it unconsciously while struggling.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>Her expression while it happened had been really cute. The way Caitlin bit In-gong accidentally and was even more startled than he was&#x2026; It reminded him of a puppy from his childhood.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&#x2018;It is really the same.&#x2019;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>Caitlin was pretty cute.&#xA0;</span><span>In-gong continued thinking that word. Then Carack narrowed his eyes and said with a serious voice,&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Prince, don&#x2019;t you think it is more dangerous if you keep thinking that?&#x201D;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;I-Is that so?&quot;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>The boat might have already sailed. It sounded like a joke, but unconsciously, it didn&#x2019;t really seem like one.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Sniff, sniff. By the way, Prince&#x2019;s smell seems to have weakened?&#x201D;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>Even though he was pretty close, the smell was thin and delicate. If the person smelling it wasn&#x2019;t within a really close distance or concentrating like Carack was now, it would be hard to know that the scent originated from In-gong.&#xA0;</span><span>This hadn&#x2019;t been the case a few days ago. Previously, just by going near him, one would smell like a flower garden.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>In-gong answered with a smile,&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&quot;I&#x2019;m controlling it.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&quot;That scent... it was the aroma from your body?&#x201D;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Yes.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&quot;And now, you&#x2019;re controlling it?&#x201D;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&quot;That&#x2019;s right.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>In-gong himself was surprised. Perhaps this fragrance was the result of the skill &#x2018; Heavenly Wine&#x2019;. Although the gandharva smelt good, In-gong&#x2019;s scent was on a serious level.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&#x2018;Plus, there is more.&#x2019;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>Thanks to the unidentified skill effect of Pheromones, his scent was able to be buried somewhat in the pheromones. It could be used to excite or calm a person.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&#x2018;Anyway, I don&#x2019;t have to worry about being eaten now.&#x2019;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>In-gong nodded with satisfaction, but Carack was still looking at him like something was strange.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Well, that is a good thing. As 6th Princess would say, you are still a prince.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Yes, so let&#x2019;s move on.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>In-gong was already very different from ordinary gandharva. He had a &#x2018;Protagonist Correction&#x2019;, separate from other gandharva.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Then Prince, do you know why something this big happened?&#x201D;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>Carack&#x2019;s expression changed as he turned to a new topic. It was a very important story, so In-gong&#x2019;s expression became serious as well.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Just before the specter of the fairy king appeared, I saw a blue aura coming from the fairy king&#x2019;s tomb.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Is it like what we saw at Thunderdoom Fortress?&#x201D;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>Their memories of that time were intense because it had been a desperate crisis. In-gong nodded.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Yes, this might be related to that power.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>Carack had accompanied In-gong and encountered the energy of Death. He didn&#x2019;t know what a Death Knight was, but he knew that the strong energy of Death was blue.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Hmm, then isn&#x2019;t there something strange?&#x201D;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;What?&#x201D;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&quot;If the power of Death was used specifically to resurrect the fairy king... why now?&#x201D;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>Carack scratched his chin and tilted his head to the side. In-gong couldn&#x2019;t understand the question.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&quot;What... does that mean?&#x201D;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Well, I mean, why? Yesterday, the power of the fog in Sky Forest was normal for Sky Forest. If they wanted to target Sky Forest, wouldn&#x2019;t it be better when the princes, princesses and 3rd Queen wasn&#x2019;t present? Or at least wait until the princes and princesses have left. I would have done it like that.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>It was a reasonable opinion. If their purpose was to destroy Sky Forest or to use the specter of the fairy king, then doing it yesterday had been a really poor choice.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Well, that might not be the only variable involved. It might not be possible to resurrect the fairy king any time they wanted.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>It was the ghost of the first fairy king, so resurrecting him wouldn&#x2019;t be an easy task.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&#x2018;Moreover, he is stronger compared to the version of him in Knight Saga.&#x2019;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>In Knight Saga, the first fairy king didn&#x2019;t use the magic fog of Sky Forest. However, yesterday&#x2019;s fairy king could only be described as a demonic god.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&#x2018;Master, the talking raccoon has come.&#x2019;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>In-gong heard Green Wind&#x2019;s voice while he was thinking. Green Wind was still exhausted from yesterday, so she wasn&#x2019;t in her semi-solid state.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&apos;Are you in pain?&#x2019;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&#x2018;I&#x2019;m okay, Master. I am just saving my strength. I&#x2019;ll be okay soon.&#x2019;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>As he exchanged words with Green Wind, the door opened. Just as Green Wind said, Amita showed up with Daphne and Karma behind them.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Is your body okay? You aren&#x2019;t hurt anywhere?&#x201D;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>In-gong expressed his concern for Amita. Daphne laughed softly.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&quot;I have heard about Prince&#x2019;s performance. Thank you, Your Highness. You saved everyone.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>Daphne and Karma greeted him politely. In-gong&#x2019;s heart warmed at their words.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&quot;I&#x2019;m glad that Daphne and Karma are safe. Amita as well.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>He was truly relieved to see that all three of them were safe. Then Amita came up to the bed and said,&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Hum, hum. Prince, there is something I want to talk about.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;What is it?&#x201D;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&quot;It is simply a feeling, but it seems like this incident is related to the attacks on the guardians.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>Amita didn&#x2019;t seem to just be talking about the purple energy or blue energy. Carack also felt the difference as he folded his arms.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Raccoon, the fog isn&#x2019;t a guardian. Oh, maybe the big ghost of the fairy king is the guardian?&#x201D;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>They knew about the events where the guardians of various places had been attacked by the monsters covered with purple energy.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Well, I don&#x2019;t know about that. Like I said, it is simply a feeling.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>Amita responded as their ears and tail moved. It seemed like they had no confidence either. Then Carack added,&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Raccoon, it seems plausible, but Sky Forest hasn&#x2019;t become a desert. Is there any more specific evidence?&#x201D;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&quot;No, I told you that it&#x2019;s just my feeling! Why are you taking it so seriously?!&#x201D;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>Amita burst out angrily.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&apos;Carack is right but...&#x2019;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>In-gong was nervous. He didn&#x2019;t forget that Amita wasn&#x2019;t an ordinary raccoon. Amita had defended the last flame for many years, so he couldn&#x2019;t ignore Amita&#x2019;s senses.&#xA0;</span><span>Carack folded his arms and was about to say something else.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>Then at that moment...&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Your Highness.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>Amita opened the door to reveal a dark elf. It was Felicia&#x2019;s aide, Delia.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Delia.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>Carack stated in a nice voice. Delia greeted Carack with her eyes, but the expressions on both their faces were unusual.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&#x2018;Is Delia the winner of the contest for Carack?&#xA0;</span><span>Doesn&#x2019;t Seira seem like she still has a chance?&#x2019;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>As In-gong was thinking this, Delia approached the bed.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Your Highness, the queen is looking for you.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;The queen? Has she woken up?&#x201D;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Yes, she just woke up. She said she has something to share with Prince. It is possible to visit her now.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>In-gong was half lying on the bed, but his stamina had already recovered. So, he nodded and said,</span></p><p><span>&quot;I understand, I will go right away. Just wait a moment.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>It was natural that he needed to be prepared to meet the queen. Delia expressed her gratitude and stepped back from the bed.&#xA0;</span><span>However, instead of putting on clothes like everyone expected, In-gong started pulling things out of his inventory.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Prince, what are you doing?&#x201D;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Gifts.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>In-gong took out the Heavenly Wine previously made for Sylvia as well as the highest quality elixir.&#xA0;</span><span>He instantly mixed them together. The combination of magic power, divinity, and Dragon Words made it an incomparable mixture.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&apos;Come to think of it, if I create new blood, will it have a better effect and taste?&#x2019;</span></p><p><span>Both Divinity and Heavenly Wine had levelled up.&#xA0;</span><span>However, it was too cumbersome to make a new Heavenly Wine right now. There were too many eyes.&#xA0;</span><span>As soon as In-gong opened the bottle of Heavenly Wind, Amita sniffed and jumped up.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Heok! Are you mixing that good drink with the elixir?!&#x201D;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&quot;It is because the queen is precious. She played a really big role in this fight.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>If it hadn&#x2019;t been for Sylvia, then he wouldn&#x2019;t have won against the fairy king. Sylvia had collapsed from depleting her magic power, so he wanted to give her more.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&quot;I-I also tried!&#x201D;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>Amita shouted. Both eyes were fixed on the Heavenly Wine.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Well, Amita also played an active role.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;T-that&apos;s right.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>Amita&#x2019;s tail waved fiercely at In-gong&#x2019;s words. In-gong patted Amita lightly on the head and said,&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Well done.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>Then he once again focused on the combination.&#xA0;</span><span>After 10 seconds or so...</span></p><p><span>Amita angrily pounded the floor with their tail.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&amp; &#xA0;</span></p><p><span>After preparing the new Heavenly Wine, In-gong changed clothes with Carack&#x2019;s help.&#xA0;</span><span>He walked along with Karma and Daphne, who was holding Amita, but it wasn&#x2019;t an exaggeration to say that Delia and Carack were leading the way.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>Contrary to expectations, Delia headed to the top floor, instead of Sylvia&#x2019;s room. As soon as Sylvia woke up, she had insisted on going to the throne on the top floor.&#xA0;</span><span>The evidence of yesterday&#x2019;s horror remained all over the palace. The number of dark elves walking around the palace was also greatly reduced.&#xA0;</span><span>In front of the office on the top floor, there were guards standing with stiff faces. However, it wasn&#x2019;t just due to fatigue and tension.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&#x2018;They are still worried.&#x2019;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>Sylvia was a very beloved queen, so it was likely the guards&#x2019; expressions were due to Sylvia.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&quot;The queen is waiting. Go in comfortably.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>A leader of the dark elf guards said to In-gong. The leader knew the whole story regarding yesterday, so he had very favourable feelings toward In-gong.&#xA0;</span><span>In-gong headed into the office. The structure of the room meant that all eyes went to Sylvia on the throne as soon as they entered.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Shutra.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>Felicia spoke from next to the throne, but she didn&#x2019;t run in his direction. In-gong looked at Sylvia next to her. Her complexion was pale, and she seemed to have no strength.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Your Majesty the Queen.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>In-gong approached the podium and bowed. Every one except Amita followed his example, and Sylvia gave a pained smile.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>Then at that moment...&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>In-gong suddenly looked up at the sky. Just like yesterday, the ceiling was open, and he could see a clear sky without any clouds.&#xA0;</span><span>The cause of his sudden action was the white woman. She didn&#x2019;t voice it, but In-gong could see it. The white woman was looking at the sky. She felt something.&#xA0;</span><span>Everyone was confused by In-gong&#x2019;s sudden action except for Sylvia. Her smile widened as she said,&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;As expected from Shutra. You already noticed.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Omamama?&#x201D;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>Felicia asked Sylvia what she meant. Instead of answering, Sylvia chanted a song-like spell.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>It was using Sylvia&#x2019;s magic power, rather than the palace&#x2019;s. Felicia was nervous about Sylvia&#x2019;s condition but fortunately, it wasn&#x2019;t a big burden. As Sylvia&#x2019;s recitation continued, sparkling lights started to pour down from the sky. It was like looking at stars in the middle of the day.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>The dancing lights descended from the sky and reached Sylvia&#x2019;s thighs. In-gong followed the light and could see what it was.&#xA0;</span><span>It was a crystal of magic power which had been broken and divided into several pieces.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>This was a fairy.&#xA0;</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p>
