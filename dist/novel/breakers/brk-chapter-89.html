Felicia comforted them, then gave orders to Robin. She thought they had to send more news because the situation was worse than when Karma left.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">After Robin left in beast form, the party ate breakfast, then headed to Spider Forest.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">They didn&#x2019;t encounter any beasts or monsters like they had during the wild night. The ones they did encounter were sleeping in a half-exhausted state, so there was no fighting.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">In-gong led the way using his mini-map.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">They were able to find Amita settled on the transparent wall of the barrier. The raccoon standing on the rock scowled at them.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;What, why did the number of people increase again?&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Amita&#x2019;s sharp gaze headed to Green Wind as she stood next to In-gong. Green Wind, who was holding In-gong&#x2019;s arm in an actualized state, declared words that were similar to Carack&#x2019;s,</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Talking raccoon, I was beside Master yesterday. I should also get my share.&quot;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">It was the elegant tone of voice that had first appeared on Enger Plains, but Amita frowned as they didn&#x2019;t like the contents.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;You are a guardian. Why should I make equipment for you?&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Green Wind shook her head at Amita&#x2019;s words and answered with an unconcerned look,</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;I belong to Master and Master is mine. Well, yes, that&#x2019;s right. So, I can receive Master&#x2019;s praise. I want to become stronger so that Master doesn&#x2019;t get hurt.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Then after finishing her words, she smiled at In-gong. The look in her eyes was asking for a compliment.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">As everyone gazed at them, In-gong stroked Green Wind&#x2019;s head with a somewhat awkward expression while Amita was speechless.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Carack noticed and suggested quietly,</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;I just wanted to tell you, this but one of my colleagues left the forest to call for support. He was with us yesterday.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">He was talking about Robin.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Amita simply growled instead of answering and glanced at those they hadn&#x2019;t been able to greet yesterday.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;8th Princess and her aide?&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;Seira.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;A talking raccoon is amazing!&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">The first was, naturally, Seira, followed by Caitlin. Caitlin had exclaimed before realizing her mistake and all eyes fell on her.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Her cheeks turned red with embarrassment.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;I am the 8th Princess, Caitlin Moonlight. It is an honour to meet you, the last blacksmith.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">If he only looked at appearance, the calm Caitlin resembled the 4th Queen Elaine.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">However, her cheeks remained red and after the greetings were finished, her eyes were filled with an aspiration that was difficult to express.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Amita laughed and asked,</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Why, what do you want to say?&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;C-can I touch you?&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Caitlin asked carefully and Felicia blinked in shock by her sudden behaviour. However, Seira just laughed with embarrassment like she had been expecting it.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Chris was Caitlin&#x2019;s emotional anchor and the reins that controlled her. In Chris&#x2019; absence, Caitlin had no choice but to act differently from normal.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Amita seemed embarrassed but they nodded readily.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;I&#x2019;ll allow it.&quot;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;Thank you.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Caitlin rushed toward Amita with a bright face and carefully stretched out her hand. Her hands moved naturally to their head and Amita closed their eyes like they were enjoying the touch.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Green Wind narrowed her eyes at the sight and asked,</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Master, do I act like that when I get praised?&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;No, you are much worse.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Green Wind&#x2019;s eyes widened at his answer, but In-gong just stroked her head a few more times. She then frowned, but her face soon became peaceful as she smiled broadly.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Felicia interrupted this strange atmosphere.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Hmm, hmm. About that&#x2026; Let&apos;s cut to the chase.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Amita was now held in Caitlin&#x2019;s arms. Amita chuckled and said patronisingly,</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;You can hug me as well. I&#x2019;ll allow it.&quot;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;There is no need.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Felicia seemed somewhat hesitant, but she refused, opening her fan.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">However, thanks to Caitlin, Amita was feeling better, so they didn&#x2019;t mind.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Tonight, they will attack the ward. So, I&#x2019;ve set up my own plan.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Amita jumped from Caitlin&#x2019;s arms and pulled out a piece of paper from thin air. In-gong didn&#x2019;t know if it was inventory magic like his or a magic tool, but he focused solely on the piece of paper.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">On the paper, there was a rough map of the terrain around a blue flame.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Until now, the enemies&#x2019; pattern can be broken down into two major phases. In the first phase, the beasts and monsters, that were driven crazy by the spirits of insanity, will attack the boundaries of the ward. It is literally just attacking ignorantly. You should&#x2019;ve seen the force of the monsters yesterday.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">They had rushed back and forth and definitely seemed crazy.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Amita glanced at Caitlin and Seira before saying to In-gong,</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;The lycanthropes are susceptible to the spirits of insanity because of the wildness in their instincts. I hope you have prepared a method to counter that.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;We&apos;ve been preparing.&quot;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">The group had discussed the specifics last night. Amita looked satisfied at In-gong&#x2019;s blunt answer.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;When the ward is moderately weakened, the white giant appears in order to destroy it. Did you see the white giant last night?&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Yes, a white light was shining from its whole body.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;It is made out of all the crazy guardians. The purple aura joins them together.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">The white giant had reached an estimated height of 20 meters. It was much taller than the zombie dragon, so he had been perplexed about how to deal with it.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;The pattern has been kept over a few days, so I think they will be doing the same thing tonight. My plan is clear and simple.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Amita put some coins made of red metal on the paper. They seemed to represent the enemy&#x2019;s movement path.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;By deliberately making a hole in the ward, the monsters will be guided there and you will defeat them in order to prevent the ward from weakening.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Amita laid a blue metal plate in front of the red ones. Then they took out white metal plates and continued talking,</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;If the ward isn&#x2019;t weakened, the white giant won&#x2019;t be able to destroy it. I have been measuring its destructive power during the last few days. So far, I&#x2019;ve observed that they can&#x2019;t maintain the white giant for long. I roughly understand the limits.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Amita moved the red metal plates and tapped the boundaries of the ward with the white metal plate.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;If the ward isn&#x2019;t broken by the time it is morning, they will go away and recover during the day. So, if we can endure the same thing for two days, it will be our victory.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">When Amita finished their explanation, Felicia kneeled on the floor so that she was at eye-level with Amita and asked,</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Are you saying that reinforcements will arrive then?&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Two days would be quite fast for the reinforcements that Karma had gone to call. However, Amita shook their head.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;There will be reinforcements, but it is more independent.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Amita smiled and tapped the center of the paper.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;In the center, where the last flame is, my weapon is charging its power. Once it finishes charging, you can defeat the white giant with that weapon.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Amita&#x2019;s voice was louder than usual due to their pride in their weapon. Felicia&#x2019;s eyes shone as she was interested in what the weapon was, but Carack was different.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;It shouldn&#x2019;t have to be recharged.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">He wished they could use it right away.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Amita glared at Carack before pounding the ground with their tail.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;It isn&#x2019;t a type of weapon in which energy can be stored in. Anyway, do you understand the plan?&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;Roughly. We just need to endure for two days?&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Felicia asked again and Amita nodded.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;That&#x2019;s right. According to my calculations, there will be no need to fight the white giant.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">It was quite ideal. In-gong picked up a few red metal plates and asked,</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Amita, will the opponents follow the path we opened?&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;They will follow. It is a situation where they can&#x2019;t think properly due to being possessed by the spirits of insanity. Aside from the white giant, those emitting the purple aura won&#x2019;t be able to do any intelligent actions. So, you don&#x2019;t have to worry about them.&quot;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Amita asserted before turning to Felicia, Caitlin and In-gong with a worried expression.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;The problem is whether you can stop the attacks. They will flock in huge numbers.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">It seemed like huge numbers would be mobilized. Felicia replied to Amita in a confident voice,</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;If you have defined a position in advance, won&#x2019;t we be able to fortify it? That means we can do it. Shutra and Caitlin are strong.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">In fact, Felicia hoped that the two people wouldn&#x2019;t be in danger, but her trust in both of them was real.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Amita stared at In-gong and Caitlin and nodded.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Hmm, okay. Then let&#x2019;s take a break... What is with those eyes?&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Amita&#x2019;s gaze was directed to Carack and Carack replied in a soft voice,</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Hey, is there really nothing you can do to support?&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Support in what sense?&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;This is the raccoon&#x2019;s fortress and we are fighting in that fortress. There should be some equipment for us.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">The meaning in Carack&#x2019;s words was that this was Amita&#x2019;s fortress and workshop. There was even a special weapon charging in the center, where the last flame was.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Amita narrowed their eyes.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Are you talking about the pieces I have already created?&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Oh, that&apos;s right.&quot;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Carack clapped like he had just thought about it.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;If you lend them to us during the battle, we will be stronger. Don&#x2019;t you want us to stop the monsters?&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">It was quite reasonable. However, instead of responding to Carack, Amita looked back at In-gong.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;You- Is he really an orc?&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;I am a pure blood orc. I don&apos;t have any other lineage.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">In fact, even In-gong suspected Carack&#x2019;s identity sometimes.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Amita sighed and sat down on their tail.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Okay, I&#x2019;ll let you borrow the pieces that I have made. Do realize the honour. It is the first time you are using Amita&#x2019;s equipment, even if it is just renting.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;I feel honoured.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Carack replied with a smile and Amita frowned again.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;It is really amazing.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Caitlin hugged Amita in admiration. Amita&#x2019;s face brightened in an instant as they laughed.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Hmm, hmm. This level is nothing.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">They looked like a cute, genius raccoon, but they might actually be a perverted raccoon. Additionally, they seemed childish.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;Why? Do you want to hug me?&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Felicia shook her head at Amita&#x2019;s question.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;There is no need. Please show me the equipment that we are borrowing.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;Okay, get ready.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Amita jumped from Caitlin&#x2019;s arms and waved their tail.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&amp;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Night came once again to Spider Forest.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">It wasn&#x2019;t an exaggeration to say that Amita had prepared a small fortress. Rocks and trees were piled to make a passage and there were also stacked wood to make roadblocks.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">In-gong and Caitlin stood side by side at the entrance of this passage. Behind them, Carack and Seira were armed with weapons, while Felicia and Delia were at the roadblocks. Daphne, who would act as the party&#x2019;s support, was located with Amita at the end of the barricade.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Caitlin and Seira were wearing pipes made of woven tree branches. They had been created by Daphne to dispel the spirits of insanity.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">As they stood side-by-side, In-gong and Caitlin were holding hands. In-gong was wearing Earth Quaker while Caitlin was wearing a gauntlet made by Amita.
