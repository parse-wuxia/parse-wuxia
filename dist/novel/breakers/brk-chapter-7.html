It seemed like they had brought their own chefs to the battlefield.&#xA0;</p><p>After the things were finished, In-gong returned to his base with Carack.</p><p>&#x2018;Wasn&#x2019;t it Zephyr who uncovered it in the game?&#x2019;</p><p>The secret of Caitlin&#x2019;s birth.</p><p>She was the illegitimate child of the 4th queen, Elaine Moonlight, and Gallehed, one of the five captains of the Demon King&#x2019;s Palace.</p><p>Zephyr was an orthodox member and didn&#x2019;t let this fact go. He incited his other siblings to unite together and raised troops to get rid of Caitlin, Chris and Queen Elaine all at once.</p><p>Caitlin, Chris and the 4th Queen Elaine resisted and as a result, both sides received heavy casualties.</p><p>Chris, Caitlin and the 4th Queen Elaine died. The lycanthropes became virtually extinct.</p><p>The forces of the other siblings who competed with Zephyr were weakened.</p><p>Zephyr, who stirred up the conflict, watched with his hands behind his back and received mild damage.</p><p>&#x2018;After that battle, his power was firmly established.&apos;</p><p>In other words, it would be good for In-gong if the Caitlin purge event didn&#x2019;t happen.</p><p>&#x2018;Or I can use it.&#x2019;</p><p>In-gong frowned at his merciless thoughts. He had talked to Chris and Caitlin for a while and ate their rice. To be honest, he was more overwhelmed by Caitlin than Chris. Her face flicked before him.</p><p>&#x2018;Ah, I don&#x2019;t know. It is still far away. Let&#x2019;s solve this situation first.&#x2019;</p><p>It was still far away. It would happen in a few years, so he could think about it later.</p><p>&#x2018;Whether I decide to use them or not, I need to raise my own power.&#x2019;</p><p>The same conclusion from this morning emerged. He could only start doing things once he raised his strength.</p><p>&quot;Carack, please prepare a team for scouting. It will be enough if we eat and leave tomorrow morning right?&#x201D;</p><p>&quot;That is great.&#x201D;</p><p>Carack nodded with a bright face. He was quite satisfied with the meal received at Caitlin&#x2019;s base.</p><p>&apos;Indeed, I acquired the Gourmet skill.&#x2019;</p><p>Gourmet Lv1. It wasn&#x2019;t helpful in combat, so he wouldn&#x2019;t actively raise the skil level.</p><p>&#x2018;What is good? Isn&#x2019;t it just developing the mouth? Then is it bad?&#x2019;</p><p>They were futile worries. In-gong cleared his thoughts and once again said to Carack, &quot;Then I will take a break. Later on, let me fill my stomach with some cows for dinner.&#x201D;</p><p>&quot;Understood.&#x201D;</p><p>In-gong left Carack and entered the tent. Now that he was alone, a sigh emerged without him knowing it.</p><p>He had truly entered the game or he had arrived at a different world that was just like the game.</p><p>There was no explanation about why this happened. In-gong wondered why he had a game-like ability.</p><p>His job was a Protagonist while his uniqueness was a Conquest Knight.</p><p>In-gong had these questions but decided to set them aside for the moment.</p><p>&#x2018;I will train with the sword.&#x2019;</p><p>From the time being, the most important thing was improving Shutra. He had to do that while gathering subordinates and investigating.</p><p>In-gong took out the wooden sword.</p><p>And the next morning, In-gong reached level 5.</p><p>&amp;</p><p>&quot;Will you be okay today?&#x201D;</p><p>Carack asked after eating breakfast and leaving the garrison. He was smiling but his eyes looked worried.</p><p>&quot;Yes, I will be fine.&#x201D;</p><p>He was a crude, oversized orc but In-gong had become accustomed to it. Carack shrugged at In-gong&#x2019;s answer.</p><p>&#x201C;Hrmm, it seems like someone has changed overnight, although it is a good thing.&#x201D;</p><p>Carack had only known Shutra for two days. Instead of responding, In-gong looked over the soldiers.</p><p>There was a total of 31 troops under In-gong, including Carack. They were all orcs.</p><p>They were local troops, led by Carack, that were assigned to In-gong.</p><p>&#x2018;Anyway, I want to continue training.&#x2019;</p><p>In fact, In-gong spend all of last night levelling up.</p><p>He had suddenly appeared in another world, so he couldn&#x2019;t sleep. However, he found it enjoyable swinging the sword and didn&#x2019;t look at the time.</p><p>The result was visible. Moreover, he grew faster because he was low levelled.</p><p>He couldn&#x2019;t help feeling happy. It was like studying and seeing his rank rise significantly in a national high school.</p><p>&#x2018;Ah, I want a sword. I want to level up.&#x2019;</p><p>Fortunately, he had levelled up this morning, so he was in the best condition. He was able to swing the sword all night despite Shutra&#x2019;s low stamina because his stamina was restored when he levelled up.</p><p>&#x2018;Huhuhu, my name is Joo In-gong. I am 1.3 times stronger than Villager A.&#x2019;</p><p>In-gong currently had an average of 13 stat points. He was stronger than an ordinary Villager A.</p><p>He intentionally left his additional points and skill points alone. It would be more difficult to level up at higher levels, so he didn&#x2019;t want to waste the additional points just yet.</p><p>&#x2018;I will save it for later.&#x2019;</p><p>The same was true for his skill points. He could learn many skills if he concentrated.</p><p>&#x2018;How do I learn magic or psychic abilities? Do I need a separate teacher?&#x2019;</p><p>As he went through his troubles in his head, he arrived at the area that he was supposed to scout.</p><p>The scouting area Caitlin assigned him was originally where the Red Lightning tribe used to live. It was an area that the Red Lightning tribe abandoned due to strategic reasons.</p><p>It couldn&#x2019;t just be left alone.</p><p>&apos;Yes, I can&#x2019;t come all the way here just to write a report on scouting.&#x2019;</p><p>Caitlin said there wouldn&#x2019;t be a big threat but he wasn&#x2019;t completely reassured. In-gong put aside his desire to level up and searched the surroundings vigilantly. While confirming the map given to Carack, he zoomed in on the mini-map as much as possible to ensure accuracy.</p><p>After approximately 20 minutes.</p><p>&#x201C;Um.&#x201D;</p><p>In-gong suddenly stopped. Carack quickly stopped the soldiers and asked In-gong,</p><p>&quot;What is it? Is it too hard? Are your legs sore?&#x201D;</p><p>He seemed to be seen as quite a big weakling. In-gong pointed to the map he was looking at and asked.</p><p>&quot;This is the correct map right?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Is there something wrong?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Rather than something being wrong...&#x201D;</p><p>There was another part. The map showed a straight path while the mini-map showed a small side path.</p><p>Why did it matter?</p><p>&#x2018;What is it? A hidden path!&#x2019;</p><p>It wasn&#x2019;t on the map. In other words, the people who made the map didn&#x2019;t know about it.</p><p>Yet, it was on the mini-map. In other words, a route obviously existed.</p><p>Then it had to be a hidden path!</p><p>&#x2018;If this is a game, then it will be an event.&#x2019;</p><p>At the end of the hidden path, there was always a monster, event or treasure. Moreover, this was a reconnaissance mission so finding anything was good.</p><p>&#x2018;An enemy might emerge but...there is Carack!&#x2019;</p><p>He had Carack and the 30 orc warriors that were at least 10 times stronger than Villager A. He didn&#x2019;t think there would be a big problem unless the enemy had superior numbers.</p><p>&quot;Carack, I will lead from now on.&#x201D;</p><p>Carack narrowed his eyes, then he burst out laughing.</p><p>&quot;Your eyes are burning. Ambition is roaring.&#x201D;</p><p>In-gong guided the orcs. The path was changed suddenly but because of Carack, the orcs followed In-gong&#x2019;s instructions without saying anything.</p><p>The side path was really hidden. After walking through bushes for a while and passing an area covered in rocks from a landslide, there was a small path covered by trees.</p><p>As In-gong had expected, the path didn&#x2019;t just end up as a path. At the end was an old stone door. There were letters engraved on the surface but they were difficult to recognize because they were covered in moss.</p><p>&quot;Wah, how did you find this? Is Prince a magician?&#x201D;</p><p>In-gong grinned at Carack&#x2019;s admiration.</p><p>&#x201C;I just did.&#x201D;</p><p>He wasn&#x2019;t a magician yet. Although, maybe, he would soon become one.</p><p>In-gong shrugged and ordered Carack and the orcs to clean up the stones around the door.</p><p>The stone door was big enough for Carack to walk through but it didn&#x2019;t budge when they tried to open it. It seemed like they had to break the stone door to get inside.</p><p>&quot;Prince, what do you want to do? Should I break in?&#x201D;</p><p>Carack asked In-gong. In-gong stared at the stone door for a while instead of answering.</p><p>&#x2018;It is like the protagonist getting a broken leg instead of dying after falling off a cliff.&#x2019;</p><p>The main character lived while others died. This was a chance to obtain money or something like an elixir.</p><p>In-gong stared at &#x2018;Protagonist Correction Lv1&#x2019; and nodded. He ordered Carack,</p><p>&quot;Smash.&quot;</p><p>Carack lifted his hammer.</p><hr><p><br></p></div><p><br></p>
