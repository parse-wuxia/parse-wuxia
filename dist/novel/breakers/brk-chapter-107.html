<p><strong>Chapter 107 Chapter 17: Test #6.</strong></p><div id="chapterContent" class="innerContent fr-view"><p></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Chapter 107 - Chapter 17: Test #6</span></p><hr><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Knight Saga often had tea party events.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Zephyr, the protagonist of the Demon World, could hold them himself or he could accept the invitation of the other royal children.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">The function of the tea party was a social meeting. As it wasn&#x2019;t an official event like the court gathering, it was smaller in size, but a greater degree of socialization was available.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">The tea parties were for collecting and exchanging information, discovering new talents, maintaining their reputation and various media play.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x2018;Sometimes the &#x201C;haha&#x201D; and &#x201C;hoho&#x201D; along with the tea and cakes makes it seem far from a meeting.&#x2019;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Although it wasn&#x2019;t a court gathering, In-gong was dressed formally when he climbed into the carriage that Flora called. Felicia, Silvan, Caitlin and Chris were already on the carriage as they had decided to go together in order to show that a new faction had formed.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Felicia was wearing a white dress that contrasted beautifully with her brown skin. Among the members here, she was the most experienced with tea parties. She was well aware of the &#x2018;correct meaning&#x2019; of the tea party.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">On the other hand, Caitlin accepted the tea party at face value and was laughing. Her rosy cheeks and sparkling eyes showed that she had high expectations for this.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">She had on a subdued blue dress, and Chris was looking out the window with a scruffy face. He was dressed in a black suit similar to what he had worn to the court gathering, but it was obvious that he didn&#x2019;t want to participate in the tea party.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Silvan was looking more colourful than usual, looking like a sailor wearing a dress suit.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Chris looked at Silvan who had shifted to make room for In-gong. It seemed like it was burdensome for Silvan to sit directly opposite Chris.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Once Carack and In-gong took their places, the carriage started moving again. Five of the royal children and four aides were on board, but it didn&#x2019;t feel crowded because it was a large carriage.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Baikal&#x2019;s mansion was located in the eastern part of the Demon King&#x2019;s Palace, and it looked more like a military fortress than a mansion.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">The overall impression was sharp and pointed, while the dragon sculptures in various places created a sense of oppression.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Baikal&#x2019;s troops were draconians. The blood of a dragon ran through them, so the people in the mansion would have considerable combat power.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&apos;Indeed, the 1st Prince...&#x2019;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Even if the order of birth was unrelated to succession in the Demon World, the eldest son was still the eldest son. As the first born and child of the demon king that had lived the longest, he received more expectations and support than the other children of the demon king.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">It was one year ahead of Knight Saga, so In-gong wasn&#x2019;t sure of the current situation, but Baikal should be getting more support than Zephyr from the draconians.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">If he had to estimate the ratio, it would be 3:2.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">With only 60%, it wasn&#x2019;t a species-wide support, but the draconians were so fearsome that it was more than the support that some of the other royal children received.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">They were guided to the reception room where the organizer of the tea party, Baikal, welcomed them.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Everybody came together.&quot;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Baikal was a young man with neatly brushed hair who gave off a pleasant impression.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">The pair of horns on his head, which could be called the symbol of the draconians, pointed straight to the sky and seemed to reveal Baikal&#x2019;s&#xA0;</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">straight-lined</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#xA0;heart.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">He was tall and broad-shouldered, but his muscles weren&#x2019;t big like Chris and Carack.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">The eldest one was Silvan, but he was Felicia&#x2019;s escort, so he allowed her to greet Baikal first. It was a bit ambiguous since they were twins, but due to the female centered nature of the dark elves, Felicia was always the first to say hello.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Felicia bowed elegantly.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Thank you for inviting me to the tea party, Baikal orabeoni.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Thank you for accepting my invitation.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Baikal embraced Felicia and Silvan lightly, then turned to Chris and Caitlin.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Chris greeted him first,</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;It is great to see 1st Prince.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">He didn&#x2019;t kneel down, but the greeting was reminiscent of the court gathering. Baikal gave an embarrassed smile at Chris&#x2019; distant attitude.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;Chris, don&#x2019;t be so stiff.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;Thank you for your consideration.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Chris still answered formally, so Baikal couldn&#x2019;t help frowning. However, that only lasted for a moment. He greeted Caitlin with a bright expression,</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Isn&#x2019;t this the first time I&#x2019;ve seen you outside of a court gathering? It is great to see you, Caitlin.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;Yes, Oppa.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Caitlin responded shyly. Baikal laughed at how Caitlin&#x2019;s reaction was completely different reaction from Chris&#x2019; and hugged her.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Finally, it was In-gong&#x2019;s turn.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">This time, Baikal greeted him first.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Shutra, it has been a really long time since I&#x2019;ve seen you face to face.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Yes, Hyung-nim.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">In-gong responded smoothly as he looked into Baikal&#x2019;s eyes.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">It was because there was no information about the original relationship between Baikal and Shutra.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&apos;Maybe there weren&#x2019;t any exchanges.&#x2019;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">The draconians, Baikal&#x2019;s mother&#x2019;s side, and the Gandharva, Shutra&#x2019;s mother&#x2019;s side, were enemies.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">However, Baikal then said words that In-gong couldn&#x2019;t imagine.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;Isn&#x2019;t it your birthday pretty soon? The gifts this year are insufficient. I will send it to your mansion on your birthday as always.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">In-gong panicked. Birthday? Did this mean that he sent a birthday present every year?</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">In-gong was reminded of the Day of Massacre.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Baikal had held the bodies of his siblings and sobbed. He had been furious at Zephyr and had gone crazy.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">If it was Baikal, he might actually be interested in Shutra.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Baikal would know roughly when In-gong&#x2019;s birthday was. Perhaps he had sent a couple of gifts a year. As the oldest, Baikal would care for Shutra, who was the youngest son. Despite not being children of the same house, they were still children of the demon king. However, no one else had cared about Shutra.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Thank you.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">There was sincerity in In-gong&#x2019;s voice. Clearly, In-gong&#x2019;s reaction had pleased Baikal as he then said in an affectionate voice,</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;It is natural between siblings. I should pamper you a bit more.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">His bright smile matched his tender voice.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Baikal led the party towards the reception area. There was already a guest who had arrived first.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;Zephyr came first. Zephyr, say hello to your younger siblings.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Just like the others, Baikal treated Zephyr as a sibling.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">At Baikal&#x2019;s words, Zephyr looked at In-gong&#x2019;s party and bowed slightly.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Felicia and Silvan laughed like they had expected this, while Chris sneered.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">...And In-gong was convinced.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">If Baikal was the light, then Zephyr was the darkness. It would have been awkward if Zephyr laughed and welcomed them like Baikal.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Zephyr, who had long blood red hair, didn&#x2019;t reveal his feelings but gave off an enormous presence just by sitting there.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Baikal sighed like there was nothing he could do and assigned a seat to each of the party members. Silvan, Felicia, Chris, Caitlin and In-gong were all seated opposite Zephyr.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">They didn&#x2019;t wait long since the time had already been set. After finishing the seating arrangements, a bell sounded to announce the arrival of 3rd Prince Victor and 4th Princess Anastasia.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Baikal also greeted Victor and Anastasia with a bright smile. The two of them were seated beside Zephyr, with Anastasia naturally being a considerable distance away from him.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Finally, all nine of the demon king&#x2019;s children had gathered. Baikal, who sat in the organizer&#x2019;s seat, started the tea party with some prepared tea and cookies.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">As Felicia had predicted, Baikal led the conversation into a friendly chat. However, he avoided topics that seemed somewhat sensitive, such as In-gong and the sword duke. It seemed as though he was going to avoid all topics that would stimulate competition.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Chris kept silent, while Silvan only occasionally participated in the conversation as he concentrated on eating the cookies and drinking the tea.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">The conversation flowed primarily between Baikal, Anastasia, Felicia and Caitlin.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Whenever Anastasia pulled out a topic about In-gong, Felicia would cut her off and Baikal would change the subject. Caitlin mostly listened, but she occasionally helped Baikal with the transitions.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">In-gong tried not to be conscious of Zephyr, who had remained silent since he first greeted them. His attitude was similar to the court gathering.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Victor kept a watchful eye on In-gong throughout the conversation. It seemed like he was trying to look for something.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">In-gong consciously took a step back. When looking at it on the surface, Baikal&#x2019;s tea party proceeded fairly cheerfully. Most of the siblings didn&#x2019;t participate in the conversation, and Zephyr was sitting at the table.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">The demon king didn&#x2019;t want his children to harm each other. There was competition between the royal children, but there were to be no attempts on each other&#x2019;s lives.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">After all, they were siblings. Even Victor, who was staring at In-gong, didn&#x2019;t have the slightest intention of provocation.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">The one who changed this atmosphere had been Zephyr.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">He had heightened the sense of crisis and made them do serious things to each other. Zephyr had planted the idea but hadn&#x2019;t suffered.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">The lycanthrope subjugation had been the peak. The demon king&#x2019;s children no longer believed in each other and had even hated each other. The minimum safety line had collapsed.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Then the Day of Massacre began.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">The children of the demon king hadn&#x2019;t been able to gather together and every one of them died at Zephyr&#x2019;s hands.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">That was why In-gong wanted to become the demon king. He didn&#x2019;t want such a future.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Anastasia suddenly turned to In-gong. In-gong smiled politely at her and Anastasia smiled back. There was an intense light in her eyes but no sense of hostility.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Baikal&#x2019;s tea party was completed. Victor had looked disgruntled as the tea party continued on, but that was all.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Baikal was satisfied with this alone. The important thing was that they had a face-to-face conversation.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Victor and Anastasia left first, then In-gong&#x2019;s party stood up to follow.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Just as they were about to leave the reception room...</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;Shutra.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">A low voice captured everyone&apos;s attention. It was Zephyr who had stayed silent so far.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">He reminded In-gong of the demon king at the court gathering. Zephyr made everyone nervous just by talking to In-gong.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;Give my regards to General Vandal.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">The sentence was short, but it had many implications.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">In-gong replied with a blank expression,</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Yes, Hyung-nim.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Zephyr didn&#x2019;t say anything more, and Baikal, who sighed as if he had seen something unbelievable, hurried In-gong&#x2019;s party out.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&amp;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">As soon as they climbed into the carriage, Felicia slumped down and complained,</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;Hah, I&#x2019;m tired. Exhausted. Tea parties with Anastasia unni are always hard. How about Caitlin?&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Felicia was exhausted after her conversations with Anastasia throughout the tea party. She had been&#xA0;</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">f</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">ine until she entered the carriage, so it was a truly impressive performance.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Caitlin smiled at Felicia&#x2019;s question and replied,</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;It was difficult but fun.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Caitlin was like a field of blooming flowers. She was also a child of the demon king, so she used the things that she saw and heard. This meant her expectations had been low in the first place, making her satisfied with how it actually went.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;Silvan oppa?&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">When Caitlin asked, Silvan pondered for a moment before responding with a very serious expression,</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;The cookies and tea were delicious.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Felicia sighed at his heartfelt appreciation.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Aigoo, I hope you were comfortable. All of you just left it to me. I didn&#x2019;t expect much from Silvan in the first place, but I thought that Chris would help at least.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Felicia cried out, and Chris just snorted.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Noonim did very well alone. I didn&#x2019;t feel the need to interrupt. Well done, Noonim. I can always rely on you.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Felicia pouted at Chris&#x2019; words. It was a sight that could never have been imagined a few months ago.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Caitlin glanced between Chris and Felicia with a huge smile, then Felicia hugged Caitlin like she was a doll.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Anyway, tomorrow is the tea party where the concubine children are invited. It is different from today since they are people we want to introduce to Shutra and our faction anyway. Relax and play games. Then after that, we will leave on our missions. You should have a good sleep today and tomorrow.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">In-gong had always left right after the court gathering, but this time, there was a lot to do.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">However, there was still tomorrow. As Felicia said, they would have to leave for the missions the day after tomorrow.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;Shutra, it is good that you chose Evian.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Chris said suddenly. It was clear that he was thinking about Zephyr&#x2019;s last words.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Felicia nodded in agreement.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Does Zephyr orabeoni also want to strengthen ties with General Vandal? General Vandal is very popular.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">If In-gong hadn&#x2019;t chosen Evian, Zephyr would have.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Why did Zephyr speak at the end?</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Was it a simple strike? Or was revealing that he was aiming for Vandal a diversion?
