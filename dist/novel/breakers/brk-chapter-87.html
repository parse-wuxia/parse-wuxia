They were able to get to the quad-core state after closing their eyes because they had already learnt the trick.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">The previous quad-core had simply been a big, strong flow of aura. However, it was different this time. Caitlin led In-gong and In-gong pushed Caitlin; Caitlin&#x2019;s knowledge of Divine Beast Authority led Divine Sura Authority to a higher level.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">In order to ensure proper aura training, the technical part should be carried out in parallel. Therefore, when In-gong first learnt Divine Beast Authority, he mainly focused on the technical elements.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">He had to do that this time but couldn&#x2019;t stop the aura training. This was just the beginning, but the feeling of the two auras uniting caused a great sense of accomplishment.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Once again, In-gong and Caitlin forgot about the time. One hour and then another hour. Then it lasted for another hour after the party finished eating together.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">The air was cold.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">As In-gong experienced the change in temperature and started to feel other things, his consciousness woke up.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">He wasn&#x2019;t sure, but it seemed like some time had passed. As In-gong&#x2019;s aura slowed, Caitlin responded to it. The two people quickly released their quad-cores and opened their eyes slowly.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">It was a twilight world. Instead of the orange of sunset, purple light that was turning black filled the sky.&#xA0;</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Moreover, the night was being pushed. The darkness was soon filled with a purple energy.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">It was a strange feeling. When he thought about it, he barely remembered witnessing the time when day and night turned around. Was it normal for day and night to change this way?</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">In-gong raised his head and stared at the night sky. Both eyes naturally looked for the moon in the darkness.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">In-gong once again felt a sense of incongruity.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Green?&quot;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">The distorted moon was shining green. It seemed like an intense poison that would make the world melt.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Additionally, there were no stars. At that moment, In-gong lowered his gaze and looked before him.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Caitlin was standing while staring up at the night sky. However, she was a little strange. Her mouth was open and her eyes were blinking like she had been drugged.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Caitlin also looked down at In-gong. Suddenly, she groaned and pushed strength into both hands.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;Kuhang!&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">She let out an incredible wolf-like roar. In-gong tried reflexively to restrain Caitlin, but it wasn&#x2019;t easy. As a mix between a lycanthrope and sura, she didn&#x2019;t have a beast form but contained the unique strength of a lycanthrope. Moreover, she was a powerful aura user, so her physical abilities were different.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Due to that, In-gong couldn&#x2019;t restrain Caitlin&#x2019;s power-</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x2018;Eh?&#x2019;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">In-gong glanced down at his two arms. Caitlin was captured by his arms and couldn&#x2019;t move. Of course, In-gong was shaking as he tried to endure her strength, but he wasn&#x2019;t being pushed.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">In-gong was applying force to Caitlin. She tried to resist his power, but she gradually began to be pushed back.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&apos;Did I gain more strength?&#x2019;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">It was like that; In-gong was stronger than Caitlin. He hadn&#x2019;t realized it because he was getting stronger progressively. Additionally, there had also been the bonuses from levelling up.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">In-gong was over level 20, so his strength had exceeded 80 points. It was much higher than his other stats because he had invested additional points. If he had over 80 points in strength, that meant he was at least eight times stronger than Villager A. It was a terrifying force.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Caitlin was still struggling, but she then collapsed and In-gong quickly took the mount position on top of her. He held down her two legs, so Caitlin was really stuck.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;Noona! Steady yourself! Noona!&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Caitlin howled instead of answering. It wasn&#x2019;t just a roar, but it sounded like she was crying out to something.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Why had this change suddenly happened? In-gong turned his head reflexively. Things were happening behind him.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;Seira! I am Carack!&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Carack said hurriedly to Seira who was growling in her beast form. He walked slowly toward her with his arms wide open like he was harmless.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Calm down, please calm down. Can&#x2019;t you recognize me?&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Carack smiled awkwardly. Seira gazed at Carack&#x2019;s face and kicked his groin.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;Keook!&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Carack sank from the strong blow. Robin, who was crazy like Seira, had picked up a sword and was pointing it at Delia. It was impossible to suppress the crazy lycanthropes with simply force.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">In-gong also felt that way. At that moment, Felicia shouted,</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Close your eyes!&quot;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">In-gong didn&#x2019;t understand, but he just believed in Felicia. Instead of asking questions, he immediately closed his eyes.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Flash!&quot;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Felicia shouted again. A bright light emerged from her two hands and swept away the darkness around her. It was such a strong light that even Felicia didn&#x2019;t dare open her eyes.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;Kiaack!&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Seira and Robin screamed at the same time. The two people temporarily lost their sight and fell down. Then Felicia took back the magic light and quickly cast a second spell.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Bind!&quot;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">A magical rope tied up Seira and Robin. However, it was just a temporary measure as the rope couldn&#x2019;t hold out long against their strength. Felicia frowned and ordered Carack and Delia,</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Cover their eyes. It will calm them down a little bit!&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Seira and Robin weren&#x2019;t beasts, but they had lost control in their beast form, so beasts taming methods seemed to fit them.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Carack seized Seira from behind and covered her eyes with his palms while Delia tied a handkerchief around Robin&#x2019;s eyes.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">It seemed to be working as their movements calmed slightly. This time Daphne was the one who shouted.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;They are spirits of insanity! Be careful not to get affected as well!&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">As soon as she said it, she closed her eyes and started to chant a spell. It was to drive away the spirits of insanity possessing Seira and Robin.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">In-gong finally roughly understood the situation. He turned toward Caitlin who was still beneath him and shouted,</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;Green Wind!&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x2018;I will try it!&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Green Wind understood In-gong&#x2019;s meaning and used her strength. A green wind started gently revolving around Caitlin&#x2019;s head.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Fortunately, it seemed to work. Caitlin&#x2019;s power weakened gradually and she no longer cried out. She closed her eyes and didn&#x2019;t move.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Are they calm?&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">In-gong looked behind him. Like Caitlin, Seira and Robin were also collapsed and unmoving.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Sleep.&quot;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Felicia headed to In-gong&#x2019;s side after putting the two people to sleep with magic. The sleep magic was also used on Caitlin.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Whether it was due to using so much magic in succession or surprise at the situation itself, Felicia&#x2019;s breathing was rough as though she was going to vomit. In-gong suddenly glanced around. He noticed something that he had failed to see previously due to the sudden situation.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">The party was now in a forest. Despite the fact that they had camped under a hill outside the forest, there were trees surrounding them.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">What was going on? Had a space jump magic been activated?</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">In-gong looked up at the green moon. The beginning of all this was the rising of this green moon.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">The spirits were afraid of the night...</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">It was because the changes occurred at night.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">The ground shook. In-gong got up from where he was sitting on Caitlin and caught the stumbling Felicia. Delia, who had her eyes closed, jumped up and shouted,</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Monsters are gathering!&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">The ringing sound from the earth was approaching them. In-gong opened his mini-map swiftly. His field of view was unclear and certain numbers couldn&#x2019;t be grasped, but red dots signifying the enemy were covering it.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;What is going on? This place wasn&#x2019;t a forest!&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">They had obviously been underneath the hill when night had fallen. There had only been a few trees nearby.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Felicia shouted, but she didn&#x2019;t expect any answers. She just grabbed Caitlin and hurriedly prepared for any enemies. Green Wind&#x2019;s voice reached everyone,</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&apos;This is a mixture of illusion and reality. The power of an exceedingly strong spirit!&#x2019;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">The green moon.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">If the moon had actually turned green, In-gong&#x2019;s party wouldn&#x2019;t have noticed it. It was obvious that the moon only looked green from this area.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">The spirits of insanity and the landscape that had changed suddenly...</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">As Green Wind said, it was all an illusion. However, it was impossible to ignore it because it was also mixed with reality.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Daphne shouted,</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Our defense has been compromised! If we run away, we can go deep into the forest!&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">In-gong glanced at his mini-map. The compass for defense was rotating wildly. The surrounding terrain had changed, so it couldn&#x2019;t figure out the direction.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">The shaking of the earth was getting bigger and bigger. It was obvious that they would soon be invaded by monsters. He had to make a decision.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;Fight here! Felicia!&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">In-gong shouted while equipping Earth Quaker and White Eagle on both arms. Felicia moved Caitlin behind her and yelled back,</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Call me Noona! Dig!&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">She used magic to dig at the ground. As if to test them, the land was immediately filled with illusions.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">It was impossible to change the terrain to block the enemies. Therefore, Felicia used different spells.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Grease! The Wind!&quot;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Felicia made the surrounding ground slippery and created a thick wind barrier behind her to prevent attacks from the rear. She wanted to use the fire barrier, but if she made a mistake, a big fire could happen and they would all burn to death.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Carack laid Seira and Robin down next to Felicia while Delia took out a sword to defend Felicia and the three people. Daphne hesitated for a moment before calling some spirits next to Delia.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">It was a situation where the strength of their group had plummeted sharply, but it couldn&#x2019;t be helped. Karma and Chris wasn&#x2019;t here, so In-gong had to be prepared to fight.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;Carack!&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;Understood!&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">He didn&#x2019;t say anything, but Carack could understand through his gaze. In-gong would attract the attention of as many monsters as possible. Meanwhile, Carack&#x2019;s duty was to protect the others.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Green Wind shouted,</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x2018;Master! They&#x2019;re coming!&#x2019;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x2018;Dragon Blood!&#x2019;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">In-gong woke up the power of the dragon. At the same time, In-gong was given the power of Daphne&#x2019;s spirits.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Kuhang!&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">The first monsters appeared through the bushes. Like Caitlin and Seira, their eyes were blank. He could sense the spirits of insanity that Daphne had mentioned.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">In-gong finished organizing his thoughts, then ran and struck the head of a wolf-like monster with his explosive power, shattering its head with one blow. As he looked around, monsters sprang out simultaneously for a joint attack.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;Fire Arrow!&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">The Fire Arrow wasn&#x2019;t only directed at the Dragon Scale Greaves. Extending from In-gong&#x2019;s fingertips, the Fire Arrow struck the monsters and part of the bush caught on fire.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Numerous monsters attacked the party. In addition to the beasts such as wolves and bears, there were also monsters that looked like giant insects. However, their eyes were all blank.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">In-gong confronted the monsters. There were waves after waves of enemies, but his couldn&#x2019;t spare his aura here.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">He was in a trance-like state and shouted as he destroyed the waist of an ant-like monster. Aura exploded and the loud sound drew the monsters to him once again.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">In-gong sprang up from the ground, flew over the heads of the insect-like monsters and used Great Mountain. An enormous force emerged from the palms of his hands and it started to push the monsters against the ground.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">With a terrible sound, some of the insect-like monsters couldn&#x2019;t withstand the pressure and exploded. As soon as In-gong landed, he was hit by a the poison from a poisonous frog. He swung his left arm which contained White Eagle.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt"><em>Kakakakang!</em></span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">White Eagle spread the metal plates like wings and flew over the monsters&#x2019; heads. Some of them couldn&#x2019;t withstand the shock of their heads being hit and collapsed.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Instead of retrieving White Eagle, In-gong made it stay near Felicia.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Green Wind wanted to fight by In-gong&#x2019;s side, but she followed his order faithfully. In-gong could fight more freely if he knew that Felicia and the others were safe.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">The passage of time was always relative. Even minutes could seem to last for ages.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">In-gong breathed in deeply. The bodies of monsters filled the area; it was evident that he had killed more than a dozen.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Instead of looking back, he used the mini-map to confirm the safety of the party and took out potions from his inventory. There were still a few monsters in the area, but they were a distance away. There was enough time for him to take a breather.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">It was at that moment...</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">A terrible sound, incomparable to before, emerged from the ground. It was almost like an earthquake was occurring.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Kyaaak!&quot;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">He heard Felicia scream from behind him. In-gong looked back hurriedly while opening the mini-map at the same time. Felicia had fallen due to the sudden shaking, but he didn&#x2019;t see any injuries. Nothing on the mini-map had changed as well.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Then a second vibration came. It was definitely different from when the monsters had been running towards them.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;Greenie! Gaze sharing!&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">In-gong shouted, pointing to the sky. Green Wind didn&#x2019;t like being called Greenie, but due to the urgency of the situation, she soared into the sky and shared her vision without saying anything.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">The forest stretched out endlessly and a blue light rose from the center of the forest. However, the cause of the shaking wasn&#x2019;t the blue light.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">The cause was to the right of the blue light.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">There was something white and huge.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x2018;Giant?&#x2019;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">He couldn&#x2019;t be sure. Although it had a humanoid shape, the body was covered with a white light, so he couldn&#x2019;t confirm it. It tried to reach the blue light but could only scratch at the air. It was like an invisible wall was blocking the giant.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">The white giant pushed against the ground again. The forest shook and the giant&#x2019;s fist finally pierced through the air barrier. It felt like something was breaking.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;Shutra! What is happening?&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;The monsters are coming back!&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Felicia and Delia shouted at the same time. Instead of calling Green Wind again, In-gong continued staring at the white giant.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">The white giant then melted into the darkness and scattered. After the giant poured all its strength into it, the invisible wall had fallen.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">It was up to there. There was nothing to watch anymore. In-gong stopped sharing Green Wind&#x2019;s gaze and shifted his gaze to what was before him. Like Delia had said, the monsters had come again.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Yet it was a little different this time. Instead of rushing towards In-gong&#x2019;s group, the monsters headed somewhere else. They literally ran towards another place.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">It was even more evident from the mini-map.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">What was it? Was someone moving them?</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Just then, there was a rustling sound from behind them. Ing-gong turned reflexively and White Eagle flew like lightning toward the sound, but the opponent was quick as well. They avoided White Eagle&#x2019;s blow and ran to Felicia.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;Wait! Don&#x2019;t attack!&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">It wasn&#x2019;t Felicia who spoke.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Delia raised her hand and tried to strike the opponent rushing at Felicia, but it was unreasonable. The person flew through the air, grabbed Delia&#x2019;s hand, flipped her around and landed on the ground. While looking up at Felicia, they shrugged and shouted,</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;Who are you? Where are you from? Are you friends of the sword duke?&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">The one shouting in an urgent voice was a plain raccoon, but unlike the monsters that had appeared so far, both its eyes were full of spirit.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Who are you?!&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Carack shouted from behind Felicia. The raccoon turned to stare at Carack, then he turned toward In-gong, who was equipping White Eagle back on his left arm, and said,</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;My name is Amita, the craftsman who keeps the last flame.&quot;</span></p><hr><p><br></p><p><br></p></div><p><br></p>
