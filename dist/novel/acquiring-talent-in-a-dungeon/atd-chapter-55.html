<p><span style="">Chapter 55 - &#xA0;Day 13 Princess and Dog (2)</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p><p><span style="">After finishing the conversation, I handed the phone to Director Oh. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;It isn&#x2019;t a big deal. The deputy manager will come back safely.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;...&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Well, it looks like something did happen. I think it&#x2019;s the result of something he did.&#x201D; I explained.</span></p><p><span style="">I thought about it again. I looked at Jin Soo-young. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;...&#x201D; As if she was suddenly burdened by my gaze, Jin Soo-young blushed and turned her head away. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">I wasn&#x2019;t looking at her in that sense. This woman. </span></p><p><span style="">I had two unique talents: Atlas and Underdog. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">I realized that unique talents were different from ordinary talents and techniques that could be gained in the dungeon. Very different. </span></p><p><span style="">The first time I had some questions was on the fifth floor. At the time of the mini-game, I chose a brutal way to reduce the number of challengers. Even those who were watching were bothered by my cruel torture. Of course, it was a reasonable method, but somewhere in my mind, I felt a sense of discomfort. Thinking about a rational method and putting it into practice were entirely separate matters. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">On the sixth floor, it turned into a certain conviction. Even if the situation was unavoidable, I solved the problem with violence. I killed everyone except for Yang Su-jin and Yoon Ji-hee. </span></p><p><span style="">Atlas: &#x2018;Your body will become stronger, leading to a desire to oppress others through violence.&#x2019; It had a huge impact on my actions. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">Underdog was the same as well. Unlike Atlas that I gained from others, this unique talent was something I already had. I was convinced as soon as I saw the description. The driving force in my life so far had been based on this unique talent. After fully awakening Underdog, my values changed one more time. Unlike with Atlas, this time I was conscious and it was easy to notice the change. </span></p><p><span style="">I was different from yesterday. If it was the me from yesterday, I likely would have been overwhelmed by the scale of the situation involving the president and retreated. </span><span style="">The point of a unique talent wasn&#x2019;t just a few paragraphs to improve my stats. It affected the formation of human values. </span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Soo-young, do you have a city?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Huh?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&quot;If you have a city then you can accompany me in the dungeon.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;...!&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Was there such a thing?&#x201D; It was Director Oh who asked. I immediately explained the Merger Rights. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Soo-young will lose a city, but I will be next to her and can give her constant protection.&#x201D; It was essentially the same offer I made to Yoon Ji-hee. </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Then... Look, isn&#x2019;t it obvious? It isn&#x2019;t something I can talk about with my status. I need to report the problem. Her father...&#x201D; Director Oh raised a fuss instead of Soo-young. </span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Then report it, but please also consider Soo-young.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">I looked at Soo-young. &quot;It isn&#x2019;t bad for everyone.&#x201D; I walked away from the mother and daughter and headed outside to wait for Kim Tae-hyun. Not long after, his vehicle arrived. </span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Oppa!&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hee-chul.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Yang Su-jin and Yoon Ji-hee came running as they saw me. Their reaction was more than I expected, so I was pleased. I never imagined that they would be able to capture a city. </span></p><p><span style="">&quot;What happened?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&quot;It wasn&apos;t a big deal. Whether we were lucky or not, the only one we encountered on that floor was the pushover.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Yang Su-jin nodded towards the car. Kim Tae-hyun was on the passenger side. </span></p><p><span style="">&quot;As soon as he saw us, he started firing his machine gun.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;So?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I charged him.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Indeed. Kim Tae-hyun&#x2019;s main weapon, that Yang Su-jin experienced yesterday, was a gun. He had the ability to fire a shotgun with the same accuracy as a pistol. Unfortunately for him, Yang Su-jin wouldn&#x2019;t die unless her head was completely destroyed. &#x201C;I used the boots from the eighth floor to avoid any tricky shots.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Still, wouldn&#x2019;t it be hard to deal with him alone?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What? Aren&#x2019;t you neglecting Ji-hee unni?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;...Ji-hee?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Ji-hee unni used the wind to deflect the bullets. Thanks to Unni, he was more likely to hit himself with the bullets.&#x201D; &#xA0;Yang Su-jin boasted proudly and Yoon Ji-hee just laughed shyly. </span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I see.&#x201D; I thought about Chang Ga-ram. Chang Ga-ram was able to use his icicles to incapacitate me. If someone learned magic and accumulated the skill, would the power gradually rise? &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">After hearing their story, I explained about the Merger Rights. &#xA0;Then I told them that it would be used by Jin Soo-young. </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What? Are you going to leave us?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Eh?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Yang Su-jin&#x2019;s eyes narrowed. </span><span style="">&#x201C;You know. I heard that the president had a daughter... You don&#x2019;t need us anymore after getting such a great girl ~ it is like this.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&quot;What is that...?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;... A joke.&#x201D; Yang Su-jin poked out her tongue. </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Jeez, this woman...&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Yang Su-jin&#x2019;s expression suddenly froze. It was the same for me. </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;...&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;...&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">We both gazed towards Yoon Ji-hee. Yoon Ji-hee&#x2019;s face was pale enough to be painted white. Her eyes were huge and were shaking like there was an earthquake with a magnitude of 7 or higher. They looked like the eyes of a dead fish. </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;...Kuk...no...&#x201D; &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Ji-hee unni?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ji-hee?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&quot;...Don&#x2019;t...&#x201D; Suddenly, in the bomb shelter, a strong wind blew. &quot;Please don&apos;t throw me away...&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">There were hiccups at the end as Yoon Ji-hee burst into tears. &#xA0;The wind became stronger. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What the!?&#x201D; The people still remaining in the bomb shelter were confused. The parked car shook slightly. </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Unni! It isn&#x2019;t like that!&#x201D; Yang Su-jin grasped the situation and hugged Yoon Ji-hee. </span></p><p><span style="">&quot;It is a joke! I... No, we won&#x2019;t get rid of Unni!&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Then she glanced at me. No, why did she joke like this in the first place? </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;It is true. The both of you... You have value and aren&#x2019;t worthless.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">The wind stopped, but Yoon Ji-hee&#x2019;s eyes were still wide open. The tears stopped flowing but she looked like she could burst out crying again at any moment. </span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Think about it. What would happen to Ji-hee if I integrate with Su-jin&#x2019;s city? Will Ji-hee be able to come along with Su-jin?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">It wouldn&#x2019;t change even if she could come along. Frankly speaking, there was no sense that Yoon Ji-hee would be profitable in reality. But I had experienced it on the ninth floor; Having sure companions in this dungeon would be a tremendous advantage. </span></p><p><span style="">&quot;If so, I would rather you continue to be by Su-jin&#x2019;s side.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Yang Su-jin was strong enough to clear the ninth floor. In addition, her brain wasn&#x2019;t too bad either. Like I just saw... Yoon Ji-hee&#x2019;s abilities had reached this level so the two of them would be able to survive by working as a team. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Of course, it&#x2019;s dangerous. But after listening to your story about the ninth floor... I believe that both of you will grow and I can join you at a later time.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;...&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I trust in Ji-hee&#x2019;s abilities... This is something that is possible.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">The wind stopped blowing completely. Behind Yoon Ji-hee, Yang Su-jin was making an &#x2018;O&#x2019; shape with her fingers. </span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I called both of you to check your safety in reality and to help with support before entering the dungeon. Absolutely never... I&#x2019;m not talking about breaking apart this group.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;... Yes.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Yoon Ji-hee wiped away her tears. She seemed convinced. </span></p><p><span style="">I glared at Yang Su-jin. </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;...&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">As I patted Yoon Ji-hee&#x2019;s shoulder, Yang Su-jin mouthed some words. &#x2018;So why are you using that woman?&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">I replied. &#xA0;&#x2018;I don&#x2019;t know yet.&#x2019; &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style=""> In the first place, this story only applied if Jin Soo-young accepted. After telling both of them to wait, I approached Director Oh again. The director spoke with an expression that was brighter than before. </span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I told her father. It was a short call but the response was good.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;...&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Honestly, I feel less worried... Of course, if you think of taking advantage of Soo-young by using her as a hostage...&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Director Oh was serious. His age meant he had a lot of experience and was guarded, but there was one disadvantage. &#xA0;This man didn&#x2019;t know everything about the dungeon. So he didn&#x2019;t understand Jin Soo-young. </span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Did Soo-young agree?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Huh?&#x201D; He was surprised that I asked such a question. He thought she would surely accept the offer. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;You haven&#x2019;t heard from her yet?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&quot;That&apos;s right. Right now, Madam is having a conversation with her.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">She was a woman who became mad due to some &#x2018;misfortune she suffered in the dungeon, only to kill a friend in reality and be trapped in a bomb shelter.&#x2019; What would Jin Soo-young be thinking? Until an hour ago, she hadn&#x2019;t even be able to think clearly. </span></p><p><span style="">&quot;This living space in the bomb shelter. Assign it to both of my people as well.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&quot;This isn&#x2019;t a space that you can use easily.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&quot;But don&#x2019;t I have to cure Soo-young&#x2019;s mind? You can think of them as my &#x2018;resources.&#x2019; It you want to continue working with me in the future then it is necessary.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;...&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">As we talked, the First Lady left the room with Jin Soo-young. &quot;I have an official ceremony to attend... I&apos;m really grateful. Student, thanks to you, I have Soo-young...&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;It isn&#x2019;t a big deal. Rather, do you mind if I ask you something?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What is it?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I wanted to ask your permission, but I have some people with me. For the time being, I would like to be housed with Soo-young alone. &quot; </span></p><p><span style="">Director Oh and the First Lady&#x2019;s expressions hardened. </span></p><p><span style="">&quot;It sounds strange but it can&#x2019;t be helped. I said that it can&#x2019;t be cured, but the signs can be monitored. Can&#x2019;t we look for a cure while watching what happens?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">There were CCTVs in the bomb shelter. &#xA0;If I did anything strange to Jin Soo-young, then they would know. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I... If Soo-young can regain her spirit...&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I will do so.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&quot;First of all, treating Soo-young is the most important thing. Of course, if she ends up hurt...&#x201D; She spoke with the face of a mother protecting her daughter.&#xA0;</span><span style="">&quot;Don&apos;t worry. I will personally persuade my husband.&#x201D; She continued.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Then... But if Soo-young says no then you don&#x2019;t need to ask your husband. Anyway, it will be better if she can be treated in less time.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">They didn&#x2019;t exactly understand the dungeon, but it was certain that minimizing damage caused by Soo-young would no longer be a problem. I passed Director Oh, who was smiling bitterly and entered the room with Jin Soo-young. </span></p><p><span style="">Jin Soo-young stood up. </span></p><p><span style="">I asked her, &quot;Yes, have you thought about it?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;...Yes.&#x201D; </span><span style="">She nodded with a determined face. </span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Ah, let me tell you ahead of time.&#x201D; I scratched my head. &quot;In the end, the answer is fixed. It doesn&#x2019;t matter even if Soo-young replies with a no.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;...!!&#x201D; Jin Soo-young looked at me with shock. </span></p><p><span style="">&quot;If you raise your voice, then I will forcefully shut your mouth.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;You...&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I have a good excuse anyway. After explaining that you were crazy, I will drain your head until it is completely empty. Haven&#x2019;t you experienced it once? What do you think will happen if I continue without stopping?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">As I was draining her, I felt a killing intent shooting from her. The killing intent wasn&#x2019;t from her talent. It was because she saw me as an enemy. It was the same as the killing intent she sent from the beginning. </span></p><p><span style="">&quot;If I think about it, there is something strange. You have a city when you were like that.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Could a person who couldn&#x2019;t control herself really be able to gain a city? It might be possible to take a floor. But in order to gain a city in the dungeon, a minimum of reasoning power was needed. The reason was that clues needed to be gathered and a method reasoned out. </span></p><p><span style="">&quot;That... &#xA0;There were no people...&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I know because I have a unique talent. It changes the way that people think, but that is the end of it.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">I was still me. Having Atlas didn&#x2019;t mean that I beat up everyone I encountered in my daily life. </span><span style="">After getting Underdog, I didn&#x2019;t run back and forth challenging people irresponsibly. Of course, what I was doing right now was a challenge. </span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Having a strong impulse and following to that impulse are separate issues. Isn&apos;t that right?&quot; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;...Are you saying that I couldn&#x2019;t endure what I did? Did you view it from my position?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I wondered if there was a &#x2018;need&#x2019; to endure it in the first place.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">At that moment, her right hand shot forward. There was a sharp sound. The speed was so fast that I wouldn&#x2019;t have noticed the movement. Of course, that was if I hadn&#x2019;t already been paying attention. &#xA0;</span></p><p><i><span style="">Tak.</span></i></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;This...!&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Once again, didn&#x2019;t I say that raising your voice was a big deal?&#x201D; </span></p><p>I whistled softly as I held her wrist. &quot;Indeed. This is the best means to find the root of the murder. I was really disturbed by the description of your unique talent. There was nothing about your mind going away as a side effect.&#x201D;</p><p><span style=""> There was nothing about the side effects anywhere in the description of the talent. </span></p><p><span style="">I continued. &quot;I&#x2019;ve been thinking ever since. You were originally such a girl.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&quot;D-Do you know who my father is? You...&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&quot;He is someone with a beautiful daughter, but she has such tastes. Did you kill someone in the dungeon and realize the real taste? You got a unique talent and sliced people in real life on the third and fourth days. Maybe they were people you met in the dungeon?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Even if she settled things on the third day, she grew too much on the fourth day. Director Oh and her parents used their power to cover up her mistakes, making it feel like a terrible tragedy was nothing. </span><span style="">Therefore, she started thinking. While other people might know about her exact talent, no one knew exactly what she went through in the dungeon. </span></p><p><span style="">&quot;If you pretend it was something to do with the dungeon, no one will know that you are such a girl.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">In fact, her parents had wandered exactly into her trap. It was easier to understand that something supernatural happened, then to think their child was born a murderer. </span></p><p><span style="">She muttered, &#x201C;...You don&#x2019;t have the evidence. It is all just guesses. You don&#x2019;t know what I did to get here.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&quot;There should be CCTV evidence. Everybody is fooled so far, but what if I told them it was an act? They might think it is ridiculous, but if they look at the CCTV recordings, will they continue being fooled by your dirty actions?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">I was holding Jin Soo-young&#x2019;s wrists. </span></p><p><span style="">The fact that she returned to her senses after the sacred creature ate her was because her consciousness scattered and she couldn&#x2019;t concentrate on acting. In addition, she had puppy eyes because she had heard the conversation between me and Director Oh. &#xA0;If I thought about it differently, this girl wasn&#x2019;t crazy. </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;...&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Jin Soo-young bit her lip. Her eyes rolling nervously indicated her shaken mental state. </span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Therefore, you can&#x2019;t refuse my offer of merger even if you want to. Everyone thinks you are such a poor girl, so why wouldn&#x2019;t you want a white knight?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;...Son of a bitch.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&quot;You are the one who will be the dog.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Of course, I had no intention of killing her for the time being. &#xA0;If I didn&#x2019;t take her city here, then she would continue carrying out her gimmick and safely clear the dungeon. I would use her father&#x2019;s power to put myself in an appropriate position until I gained enough strength. My plan was something like that. </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Now, take this.&#x201D; It was the merger ticket. I offered it to her.&#xA0;</span><span style="">&quot;Do you still have hope? In the end, you are the princess I have to attend to. If you do your best, then I might be tamed.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I will kill you.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Uh huh. You will see blood if you try to bite a dog.&#x201D; Well, on the contrary, it wouldn&#x2019;t be bad if the dog tamed the princess. </span></p><p><span style="">Jin Soo-young looked into the air. The letter of merger appeared before her eyes.</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p>
