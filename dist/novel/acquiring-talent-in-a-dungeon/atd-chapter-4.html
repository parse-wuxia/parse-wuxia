I couldn&#x2019;t adapt when it was such a bright morning.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">[Endurance: &#xA0;11]</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">[Concentration: 11]</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">[Willpower: 12]</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;12 willpower?&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Obviously, I had raised Pain Tolerance to level four. Nevertheless, willpower was only at 12 points. It seemed like the changes in decimal numbers wasn&#x2019;t so simple.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">I covered my face with both hands and sat on the bed. I recalled what happened in the dungeon yesterday. Memories of tears, a runny nose and punching a wall with a severed hand came to mind.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">I couldn&#x2019;t bear it and fainted. After I woke up, I had crawled like a madman towards the stairs. It was painful, to the extent that I had thought I&#x2019;d rather die.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Now I had to return to the dungeon at midnight tonight. Was it worth continuing after all that pain I experienced yesterday? I asked myself the question. The answer came straight away.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;Am I crazy?&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">There were no flaws in my brain so why did I ask this question? 10 times. 100 times. 1,000 times. It was right even if I asked myself 10,000 times.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Pain? It was irrelevant. I could endure it anyway. There was no going back. If I poured in hard work then I would definitely get benefits.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">In reality, I clenched my teeth and endured it, no matter how sick I was. My abilities would definitely rise up and break through the limits.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Okay. I came to a conclusion. I got up from the bed. I cleaned up the mess cluttering my room. I did the laundry, washed the dishes and threw out the old garbage.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">After a shower and brunch, I felt more motivated than I had been in a long time. Okay. I braced myself and started on the work that I needed to do.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">That&#x2019;s right. It was an outsourced coding job that I received from a senior graduate. I opened the used notebook that I&#x2019;d owned for three years.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Dungeon?</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Of course it was the most important issue. But I only knew three things about the second floor: it would become bigger, monsters will emerge and I would meet someone else.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">None of my other questions had any answers. If I could carry a weapon then I would start preparing.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">So the only thing I could do was wait patiently until midnight. Should I spend all day worrying about it? Wasn&#x2019;t that a waste?</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">The dungeon was certainly a gold mine but this was now. My current living expenses were more important than the unknown talents I might get in the future. &#xA0;And what if I experience the change in having ascended stats while working?</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Although they weren&#x2019;t over 10, abilities were able to rise and my concentration was also 11 points. The coding wasn&#x2019;t a very difficult task. It was easy to buy other companies&#x2019; code and attach it. However, it was a major challenge for me. In order to save on costs, I decided to write the code myself.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Although the due date was relaxed, I had a free schedule so it should be easily finished by next week. I started at 11:45 am. If I didn&#x2019;t do anything else and worked hard then I should be finished by dinner.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;Good.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">I opened the screen and launched the Eclipse window. For a while, it was silent except for the banging on the keyboard.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt"><em>Tadak!</em></span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt"><em>Tadadak!</em></span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">...</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">...</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Well.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">I hadn&#x2019;t checked my cell phone yet but I was almost certainly finished. It was sometimes like that when the work was fun or urgent. There didn&#x2019;t seem to be any apparent differences.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Anyway, I worked until I finished.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">After putting the code on the server, I stretched while feeling somewhat disappointed. Was it too greedy to want a dramatic change? Maybe I should buy a lunch box from the convenience store...</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Eh?&quot;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">It seemed like my eyes weren&#x2019;t working. I rubbed them and looked once again. The clock&#x2019;s minute and hour hand still remained in the same spot.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">It was 3:40 pm.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">I hadn&#x2019;t looked at the clock while working. The reason why I thought it was evening was because I knew my maximum speed.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">I&#x2019;d expected it to be as early as 6 pm. Maybe 7 pm at the latest. Or maybe even later than expected.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">But 3:40 pm?</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Only that much time has passed? Did I really finish all of it? I decided to review the code once again. It was clean. Even if it wasn&#x2019;t perfect, it was as good as it could get with my present skills. Yet... I had finished it nearly twice as quickly.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">This was completely crazy.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt"><em>Kkoruruk!</em></span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">An alarm started ringing. I hadn&#x2019;t felt hungry until now, but once I was aware it was terrible. I had eaten the same amount of rice that I normally did, yet I was starving before it was even dinner time.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">My abilities had risen from 10 to 11.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Even if I didn&#x2019;t know the details... Maybe it made a far greater difference than I thought. Anyway, my work was finished so I decided to have a meal.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">I felt slightly at ease as I went into the convenience store. I bought a special bulgogi lunch box that was to my taste. I also got an extra cider bottle.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">As I returned, I saw a red-haired person smoking in front of the building: An Su-hyun.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;...&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">He looked me up and down while smoking and beckoned. I had to comply as he was smoking right in front of the entrance. As I approached, he blew out smoke and said,</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Did you dump that?&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">He was referring to the garbage dump site. I had stacked up all the convenience store lunch boxes there.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;It isn&#x2019;t me.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;No, you are clearly holding the same product in your hand.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">What was with this bastard? He even looked at what I bought? There was no use in arguing.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">If I had describe him to a friend, he was the manager of the building. He was the only son of the building owners. He was the same age as me but we disliked each other, and I prayed never to encounter him. However, his parents were pretty good to me.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">They asked me to be the private tutor of their son and paid extra tutoring fees. Every time school finished, I tried my best to help him. But he never listened in class. He didn&#x2019;t do the homework and received a shocking score in the mock exam. No university I knew would accept a score of 777.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">It was crazy.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">His parents weren&#x2019;t familiar with university admission so he used the pretext of studying to receive a salary for the building manager position.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Even though his parents owned a separate house on the rooftop, he stayed in a rented room in the name of concentrating. Of course, he didn&#x2019;t pay rent.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">I didn&#x2019;t think I could control my mouth and I wanted to continue staying in this building, so I quit the tutoring. I hated the thought of looking pathetic if he tried to pick a fight with me. Oh, it was true that I did look pathetic in front of him.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Be more conscientious. Yes?&quot;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">A cigarette butt came flying towards me while he said such things. I couldn&#x2019;t hit An Su-hyun. There was nothing I could do so I walked past An Su-hyun. His words could be heard from behind me. &#x201C;It&#x2019;s true. Everything they say about students from O University.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">There were many sick minded friends in this world. I couldn&#x2019;t become angry when encountering all of them. I wasn&#x2019;t made enough to provoke them. It was only occasionally that their values and way of life were so incomprehensible that I thought they were quite sad. If I was in that position, I would have lived better.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Well, I wouldn&#x2019;t know unless it really happened to me.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x25CE;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">My first impression was that the second floor was no different from the first.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">The only thing was that the path split into three as soon as I descended the stairs. I turned around and looked at the stairs.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">[You are not allowed to step on the stairs again. If your feet touch the stairs, you are out.]</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">The moment I stepped on the stairs, the second floor had appeared. Then we couldn&#x2019;t go back to the first floor? I pulled out my cell phone and took the right path.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">[Cartography LV 2. 29/200]</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">While drawing the map, I paid the utmost attention to my field of vision while moving.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Monsters below E rank. If I thought of this as a game, the first monster in a game wouldn&#x2019;t be one that put the player at risk. However, the possibility of suffering considerable pain like having my wrist cut off was large. I had to be as careful as possible. I was tense every time I had to turn a corner.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Then I heard footsteps coming from around the corner.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;...&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">I breathed and waited in a spot where I could see clearly. Soon, the shape of a person popped around the corner!</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Aaaagh!&quot;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">It wasn&#x2019;t me who screamed wildly.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">I had been prepared after hearing the footsteps, and I had expected it to be another explorer instead of a monster. But that didn&#x2019;t mean I wasn&#x2019;t surprised.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;W-w-what? Y-you are Kim Hee-chul.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">The person called my name. I hadn&#x2019;t expected the other human to be An Su-hyun. An Su-hyun was like me...</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Was it that common to enter this dungeon? If so, how many other people who lived close were in the dungeon?</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;No... I-it is natural to cry out when seeing another person.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;Yes. &#x2018;I see that you are here.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;I was surprised because you suddenly f***ing popped out...&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">An Su-hyun had been shocked when he saw me but now he spat out curses.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;...&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;...&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">It became silent as his shaking calmed down somewhat. There was nothing to say.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;I will go this way.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">I talked first as I took a step. It wouldn&#x2019;t be helpful to stay with someone like him.

Well, I also thought about doing it.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">He didn&#x2019;t ask about the &#x2018;Cartography&#x2019; skill above the cell phone so he probably couldn&#x2019;t see it. Of course, I didn&#x2019;t feel the need to explain it to him.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Let&apos;s walk a little faster. It&#x2019;s straight ahead.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">An Su-hyun moved forward and disappeared from my sight.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;Eh?&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">I made a sound a few seconds later. When I caught up with him, An Su-hyun was standing next to a box.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">[Wooden Box. There seems to be no lock.

He was frowning and looking away from it. He had been on the first floor as well. I squatted in front of the box. An Su-hyun, who was trying to pass the box, frowned.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">When I opened the box lid, it was still dark inside. I had placed my hand in here yesterday and suffered.

An Su-hyun was making a strange smile.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;I just opened it but I was worried due to the darkness.

He thought I didn&#x2019;t know about the box. I stared at the open lid of the box. &quot;I know since I&#x2019;ve played games before. Usually, something like this would have a trap.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">My tone was overly casual compared to normal. I tried to be confident against the antagonism.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;I think that you&#x2019;re thinking too much.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Then you should put your hand in.

Unfortunately for him, I had no intention of meeting his expectations.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">It really could be a trap. Even though I could raise my talent, I didn&#x2019;t know what would happen on the second floor so there was no point losing my wrist.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">I thought about the words I saw over the box yesterday.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">[Wooden Box.
