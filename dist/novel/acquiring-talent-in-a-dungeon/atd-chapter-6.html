It seemed like this was the source of confidence behind An Su-hyun attacking the wooden dummy so fearlessly. I didn&#x2019;t know if I cracked the nucleus, but according to the description of the item, it was a good weapon against golems. An Su-hyun just overlooked the fact that the dummy was a professional fighter.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">[Use the &#x2018;load&#x2019; command to put it into the inventory.]</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">I was happy to take the sword that had been thrown away.

It was the one that An Su-hyun came down. I didn&#x2019;t think much of it and went on my way.

The room was a dead end with the exact same staircase. What did it mean? I thought about it for a few minutes and came up with a few speculations.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">The other staircase and this one. There were two staircases that led to different third floors.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">I thought about earlier. An Su-hyun was on a different first floor from me.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">There must be countless first, second and third floors that were exactly the same. Right now, there might be many people thinking the same thing as me on the other second floors: the stairs ascending and descending just created another maze.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Well, there was no point thinking about the whole structure of the dungeon just yet. If two stairs led to different third floors, should I go down the same stairs as An Su-hyun?</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Honestly, my first thought was &#x2018;No.&#x2019; I disliked An Su-hyun. An Su-hyun had abandoned me before and being in the same place as him would be stressful. But another idea came to my mind. An Su-hyun was a jerk.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">At least on this floor, the dungeon seemed to encourage competition rather than cooperation. I couldn&#x2019;t get an item when the other person did. The number of monsters was limited and they gave small experience.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">If two people fought the wooden dummy together, would the Ravenous Wolf Fist technique be passed on to both of them? Probably not.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">In other words: Dungeon space has expanded. You can encounter +1 explorer.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">This is what those words meant. It would be harder to take things. Also, the number of people that things would have to be shared between would increase. On the third floor, I would encounter two people.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">If I followed An Su-hyun, I could be assured that one of the two competitors was a fool.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">If the third floor was no different from the second floor and competition was encouraged, it would certainly be profitable. However, if there was an area where cooperation was required then we would fail.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">I worried about it for a bit. Then I descended a staircase.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">[2nd floor cleared.]</span></p><hr><p></p><p></p></div><p></p>
