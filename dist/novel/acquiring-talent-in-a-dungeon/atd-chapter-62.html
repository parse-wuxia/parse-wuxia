<p><span style="">Chapter 62 - &#xA0;Day 13, 10th Floor Price-Performance Ratio</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p><p><span style="">The moss from Lewin Castle was able to be dried and drank as a tea. &#xA0;</span><span style="">According to Mino, the drink used to be exchanged with other regions. </span><span style="">Now that the other areas were gone, they ate it to gain as much nutrients as possible. </span></p><p><span style="">Anyhow, it wasn&#x2019;t bad when I drank it. </span><span style="">It was like a herbal tea with a slight sweetness. I didn&#x2019;t like hot drinks like coffee, but it was a taste that I would buy at a cafe. </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;....&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">I drank it and the sweat on my body dried. </span></p><p><span style="">I suddenly felt like it was a waste. </span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Your Majesty.&quot; </span></p><p><span style="">I turned my head and saw Mino. </span><span style="">This was her office. She was standing next to the desk while holding a kettle. </span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Would you like some more?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style=""> &#x201C;...Yes.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Unlike me, Mino had already washed. However, her skin was still damp and I could smell the scent of her body. </span><span style="">As I became aware of the smell, I felt something rising inside me again. I hurriedly drank the cup again. </span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Ahh, it is too hot...&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Yes. So please drink up.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">I looked at her mouth and neck before suppressing the boiling feeling inside me. </span></p><p><span style="">What was this? </span><span style="">It felt like something was crying out in my heart. </span></p><p><span style="">A little bit more. A little bit more. </span></p><p><span style="">It seemed like the body and mind had become one. </span></p><p><span style="">It was a natural physiological reason. </span><span style="">I could have just explained it as a lot of stress accumulating in the meantime. I was a man and it wasn&#x2019;t strange for a man to like a woman. </span><span style="">But I had Jin Soo-young a few hours ago. It was a few times. Now I couldn&#x2019;t stop thinking about correcting the mistake that I made before in rejecting Mino. Therefore, I ended up drinking as much tea as possible. </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;....&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;....&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Mino looked down with a red face like she knew what I was thinking. &#xA0;</span><span style="">Fortunately, it seemed like she wasn&#x2019;t offended. Anyway, I would investigate this strange feeling after I finished my task. </span><span style="">The thing that I was working on... </span></p><p><i><span style="">Pak.</span></i></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;...!&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Mino retreated with a look of surprise. </span></p><p><span style="">[There is an invasion from outsides.] </span></p><p><span style="">[You can expel them using the command - Expel.] </span></p><p><span style="">The Chinese man had returned on one side of the office. It was the same place that I tore his ticket 12 hours ago. </span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Can you go outside? It is dangerous.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Mino immediately followed my instructions. </span><span style="">The Chinese man had recovered to some extent. His HP was 2/3 restored and he was holding a ticket in his hand, as if in preparation to flee. I appeared in front of him and kicked out. </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ack!&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">The ticket fell to the ground. </span><span style="">I grabbed the groaning man and placed him on a chair. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;#%&#xB7;&#xB7;&#xB7;&#xB7;&#xB7;&#xB7;. @#%<a href="email-protection.html" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="173657">[email&#xA0;protected]</a>&#xB7;&#xB7;&#xB7;&#xB7;&#xB7;&#xB7;.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">The Chinese man spat out curses. </span><span style="">Even though the sacred creature had eaten his unique talent, he was almost completely recovered as he glared at me. </span></p><p><span style="">&quot;It is fun to have a conversation in a language we both know.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">I spoke in English. </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;My... My unique talent, how...&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I ate it.&quot; </span></p><p><span style="">I made the gestures of eating something. </span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Yum yum yum.&quot; </span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Bullshit.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">He said with an expression that asked me not to joke around. </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;That isn&#x2019;t possible.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Isn&#x2019;t it reality? You can check with your own eyes.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">If he wanted to get it back then he needed to answer my questions. </span><span style="">Then I would be able to extract the information I wanted. </span></p><p><span style=""> &#x201C;You... I know you killed Yan. Then you don&#x2019;t have my talent.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;....&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Your eyes... Why...?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">I felt something strange. </span><span style="">I changed my words. </span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I don&apos;t know what you are talking about. I have both your talent and Yan&#x2019;s. I also have two more unique talents.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">In fact, one of them had become the dog&#x2019;s food. </span></p><p><span style="">&quot;That is crazy!&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">It was the same reaction. </span><span style="">He really didn&#x2019;t believe it. I had to pay attention to the nuances in his words. </span><span style="">It wasn&#x2019;t the fact that his talent was taken away, but denial that &#x2018;I&#x2019; had it. </span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Why, are you so envious that you can&#x2019;t stand? Do you feel envy that I have four unique talents?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">There was something obvious. </span></p><p><span style="">China might be different from South Korea. If they made a system that collected explorers quickly like Director Oh guessed, they might have a lot more information than me. </span><span style="">And there was a discrepancy between that information and what I knew. </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;People... Fool... I know.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Let&#x2019;s do a little bit more. </span><span style="">Just as I was opening my mouth, </span></p><p><i><span style="">Duguen.</span></i></p><p><span style="">My heart started to beat very quickly. </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;...!!&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">What? </span></p><p><span style="">I took one step back and touched my chest. It wasn&#x2019;t just my heart running wild. </span></p><p><span style="">More violence. </span><span style="">Don&#x2019;t let anyone command you. </span><span style="">Become stronger. Train harder. </span></p><p><span style="">My own voice was ringing in my head. I was burning with familiar feelings. But there were also some feelings that weren&#x2019;t boiling over. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">Impatience. </span><span style="">The emotion that emerged when I was started something and waiting for it to pay off. Regret that the future would be over if things didn&#x2019;t improve right away. </span><span style="">What had I done so far? </span><span style="">I had to do something right now. </span></p><p><span style="">Right now. </span></p><p><span style="">Right now. </span></p><p><span style="">Right now. </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ek...&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">The desires for things that couldn&#x2019;t be done right away constantly rose inside me. &#xA0;</span><span style="">It felt like someone who could control my emotions had artificially manipulated me. </span><span style="">Now I got it. These impulses were the reason why I kept on thinking about sleeping with those two women over and over. </span><span style="">Now it was a dozen times worse than before. </span></p><p><i><span style="">Tak.</span></i></p><p><span style="">I staggered back. The countless impulses were creating errors in my body&#x2019;s computer, meaning it couldn&#x2019;t follow any simple orders. </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;That... It was true.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">I looked forward. </span></p><p><span style="">The Chinese man was looking at me with a disbelieving expression. A new ticket was in his hand. </span><span style="">But he didn&#x2019;t tear it. </span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I don&#x2019;t know why you said those things just now.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;....&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">The Chinese man said, &quot;Heart demons. It is a natural symptom. Yan&#x2019;s talent and my talent. It is too much for you to take possession of those treasures.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">He brought out a new sword from his inventory. </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Heart demons...?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Did you really not know? Hah. So you conversation about the four talents was just nonsense.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Retreat. </span><span style="">I desperately tried to command my body. </span></p><p><span style="">He thought I was already caught so the Chinese man walked forward slowly at a leisurely pace. The sword handle turned in his hands. </span></p><p><span style="">&quot;If there were four, no three, you wouldn&#x2019;t even be able to stand like that. Unique talent? It is a special desire that only a small number of those who come in here can have. A human can never keep several of them in a bowl.&#xA0;</span>Let alone... It is hard to suppress just one unique talent.&#x201D;</p><p><span style="">Let&#x2019;s say that his words were true. </span><span style="">Why did it only show up now... </span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Let alone four...&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Ah. </span><span style="">Sacred creature. </span><span style="">By the time I realized Underdog, my second talent, the sacred creature had started living in me. Did he take the role of eating my desires? </span></p><p><span style="">Now he was sleeping and couldn&#x2019;t answer. When I thought about it, touching Jin Soo-young... It wasn&#x2019;t a unique talent but I fed on Jin Soo-young&#x2019;s desires. </span><span style="">Shortly after that, I joined my body with Jin Soo-young. </span><span style="">It was my intention to sleep with her, but my thoughts were more severe. </span></p><p><span style="">Now that the sacred creature wasn&#x2019;t eating it, the desires overwhelming me were boiling over. </span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Either way, this is a good opportunity.&quot; </span></p><p><span style="">The Chinese man stood in front of me. </span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I had always wondered. Whether I am a vessel who can endure two unique talents. Each person will have a different tolerance.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;...Kuk.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">I was curious about his words. </span><span style="">There was no doubt that I was such a vessel. I faced him. </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yen can feel relieved.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">He swung the sword. </span><span style="">I bit my lip. </span></p><p><i><span style="">Jaaeng!</span></i></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Uh?!&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">The Chinese man took a few steps back. </span><span style="">My fist had hit his sword. I bit my lip harder. Dammit. Get moving. </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;...You still have the ability to move that much with two desires.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">I had three, motherfucker. </span></p><p><span style="">I raised my fist in a fighting pose. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">It was painful but... I forced out every last bit of strength. I was able to move my body somehow as I got used to the pain. It was necessary to concentrate on just the simplest movements but it was getting better. </span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Yen will be vexed!&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">He rushed forward again. </span></p><p><i><span style="">Jaaeng!</span></i> <i><span style="">Jaaeng!</span></i> <i><span style="">Jaaeng!</span></i></p><p><span style="">It was clear. I saw where the attacks were coming from. The move to stop it. If my body was fine then I could easily knock him out. </span><span style="">But despite such obvious attacks, I couldn&#x2019;t overwhelm him. Was this the feeling of playing on a lagging computer? My body reacted slower than my instructions. </span></p><p><span style="">But that was fine. </span><span style="">I wouldn&#x2019;t act hastily. </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hiyah! Hiiyah Ick!&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Sounds emerged from the Chinese&#x2019;s mans mouth. There was a difference in strength so I wasn&#x2019;t the only one feeling impatient. </span><span style="">He was impatient to break my defense. As time passed, his breath was becoming heavy with exhaustion. </span></p><p><span style="">Me? </span><span style="">Unfortunately, I was just frustrated at my movements. The stamina expenditure was zero. </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;...Wah... Look...&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">I set up my defenses. &#xA0;</span><span style="">He never tore his ticket. His ego didn&#x2019;t allow him to miss making up for his loss. </span><span style="">The game was over once he became tired and moved slower than me. </span></p><p><i><span style="">Snap.</span></i></p><p><span style="">But there was a variable. </span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Your Majesty!&quot; </span></p><p><span style="">The door opened and Mino entered. </span><span style="">She might have heard the sound of the sword or noticed something unusual. Mino was looking at me with a deep expression of worry. </span><span style="">I managed to control my expression but it was apparent to the Chinese man. </span></p><p><i><span style="">Tak!</span></i></p><p><span style="">The Chinese man jumped towards Mino. </span></p><p><span style="">I followed him as well. But these damn legs! </span></p><p><span style="">Get moving. </span><span style="">Kill that guy. </span><span style="">Kill him! </span></p><p><span style="">My heart cried out. </span><span style="">It wasn&#x2019;t a direct instruction to anyone. </span></p><p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">Yes.</span></i></p><p><span style="">There was an answer. </span><span style="">Something popped out of my chest and cross my vision in an instant. </span><span style="">In fact, there was one more thing. I couldn&#x2019;t connect it. The sacred creature I knew was just a small dog. </span></p><p><i><span style="">Kwajik.</span></i></p><p><span style="">Even though he was short, he was firmly biting the neck of an adult man. </span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Ack!&quot; </span></p><p><span style="">He swung his head and shook the Chinese man like a doll. </span></p><p><i><span style="">Peeok!</span></i></p><p><span style="">The creature on the ground was far from the appearance of a fearsome beast. </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ah... Ahh...&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Mino sat down with fright.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The origin of her fear didn&#x2019;t care about Mino. He just looked at the Chinese man who almost stopped breathing and headed towards me with a wagging tail. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">Master!</span></i></p><p><span style="">The dog had a body length of three metres and painted as it saw me. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">[&#x2018;Sacred Creature: &#x298B; &#xA0;&#x298C;&#x2019; materialization complete.] </span></p><p><span style="">[The species is unable to be identified.] </span></p><p><span style="">[The name is unable to be identified.] </span></p><p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">Me, give me a name.</span></i></p><p><span style="">I didn&#x2019;t know if the Chinese man&#x2019;s unique talent would ultimately affect me. </span><span style="">But one thing was for sure. </span></p><p><span style="">The price-performance ratio of the dog was very good.</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p><p>[TL Note: This chapter hasn&apos;t been edited so sorry about any mistakes.
