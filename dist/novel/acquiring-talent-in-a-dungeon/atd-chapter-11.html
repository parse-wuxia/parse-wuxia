It was an empty glass tube that was approximately two metres tall.</span></p><p></p><p></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0;"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt;">[The total amount of HP reduced in the room will be stored.]</span></p><p></p><p></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0;"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt;">[Once a total of 200 HP is stored, the entrance will open.]</span></p><p></p><p></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0;"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt;">I seemed to be the only one who immediately understood the meaning immediately, but the high school girl and two men cried out a few seconds later.</span></p><p></p><p></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0;"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt;">My HP was 129 points. In other words, I needed to put a person with &#xA0;higher HP than me into a critical condition, or even kill them. If I thought rationally, it was possible to satisfy the conditions without killing anyone. However, I intuitively sensed that someone would be killed.</span></p><p></p><p></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0;"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt;">This was it. The eyes of the man with scratches who I dubbed &#x2018;Scratchy&#x2019;, moved nervously. Maybe he was thinking something similar to me.</span></p><p></p><p></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0;"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt;">From appearance alone, the strongest person in this place was the man with the knife. The weakest one was the high school girl. This wasn&#x2019;t a game where the strongest would eliminate the weakest. The middle-ranked people-- I intuitively sensed that Scratchy and I were placed in that group.</span></p><p></p><p></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0;"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt;">&quot;That...&#x201D;</span></p><p></p><p></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0;"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt;">&#x201C;This...&#x201D; Just as we were both about to say something...</span></p><p></p><p></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0;"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt;">&quot;Help me!&#x201D; The scream of the high school girl caught our attention. She was teary-eyed but I didn&#x2019;t know what she was scared of. Her finger... It was pointed towards me? &quot;H-he raped me.&#x201D;</span></p><p></p><p></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0;"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt;">Huh?</span></p><p></p><p></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0;"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt;">The situation was so surprising that I couldn&#x2019;t even say anything. Tears flowed down the cheeks of the schoolgirl. &quot;On the second floor, we met... H-he said that if I wanted to live... The other person was killed... So, so...&#x201D;</span></p><p></p><p></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0;"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt;">She was very good. In fact, I&#x2019;d seen someone being killed on the floor above. Maybe all three of the people here had their hands dirty. Even if I had done such a thing, it wasn&#x2019;t actually a major issue for them. The important thing was that it was a good pretext for a witch hunt.</span></p><p></p><p></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0;"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt;">&quot;This fucking bastard!&#x201D; Scratchy cried out with an angry expression as he rushed straight towards me.</span></p><p></p><p></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0;"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt;">Fast.</span></p><p></p><p></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0;"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt;">Was it a technique? Was he an athlete? I hit him with my left fist, but his counterattack struck me in the face.</span></p><p></p><p></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0;"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt;">[Current Balance: 92/129]</span></p><p></p><p></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0;"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt;">One hit had caused this much havoc. The strength of his hit was much greater than I thought. Still, the exchange was successful.</span></p><p></p><p></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0;"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt;">&#x201C;Ah...?&#x201D; There was a groan. After his blow, Scratchy started staggering.</span></p><p></p><p></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0;"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt;">[Talent has been acquired.]</span></p><p></p><p></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0;"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt;">[Talent - Hidden Weapon Technique: &#xA0;The ability to use darts and handle hidden weapons.

It was a blow I had been preparing since I saw him being so eager to fight. There was a possibility that he might have experienced the needles upstairs. Thus, I hit him with three needles at once.</span></p><p></p><p></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0;"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt;">&#x201C;Aaaaaaack!&quot; A scream emerged as he staggered. I hit him in the neck, chest, abdomen and the last one in the face. After using&#xA0;</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt;">Limiter Release</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt;">, I accurately punched him five times with all my strength. His HP fell to a critical state instantly.</span></p><p></p><p></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0;"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt;">As Scratchy tried to move his body back, I turned around.</span></p><p></p><p></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0;"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt;"><em>Bam!</em></span></p><p></p><p></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0;"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt;">My fist hit something iron. I stopped the knife with my fist and was fine. I had been warily watching the other man, so I was able to take action, but I had been worried about whether I could stop the attack or not.</span></p><p></p><p></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0;"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt;">&quot;Don&#x2019;t believe that is the end.&#x201D; The other hand of the middle-aged man caught my neck. He literally lifted me up. &quot;I can&#x2019;t let you eat it all.&#x201D;</span></p><p></p><p></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0;"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt;">Eat? What did that mean? I grabbed his wrist. Did he think it would be that easy? Both legs and my waist. I put strength in my hands and held firmly.</span></p><p></p><p></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0;"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt;">&#x201C;...!&#x201D;</span></p><p></p><p></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0;"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt;">&#x2018;What is this power?&#x2019; His confusion was apparent on his face. It even surprised me. The middle aged man was strong. I had used Limiter Release but I still couldn&#x2019;t win with strength.</span></p><p></p><p></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0;"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt;">[Current Balance: 89/129]</span></p><p></p><p></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0;"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt;">[Current Balance: 88/129]</span></p><p></p><p></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0;"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt;">Due to the fact that I was fighting beyond my original strength, I was gradually losing HP. I gazed sideways to see the schoolgirl. The bitch was chewing on her fingernails as she watched us.</span></p><p></p><p></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0;"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt;">She seemed to be thinking. I gently twisted the wrist of the hand that was holding the knife. As I held onto the wrist, I forced strength into my leg. But that wasn&#x2019;t the end. I also poured strength into both thighs and &#xA0;kicked upwards at the middle-aged man.</span></p><p></p><p></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0;"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt;">&quot;Ugh!&quot; I kicked his wrist and the man winced, stepping back. At that point, I had 1/6th of my HP remaining. I quickly drank a potion bottle from my inventory. I took out three needles and looked at the girl.</span></p><p></p><p></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0;"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt;">&#x201C;...Hik!&#x201D; She stared at me with shocked eyes.</span></p><p></p><p></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0;"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt;">The middle aged man was still recovering. Rather than getting rid of him, I would remove the unknown risk behind me.</span></p><p></p><p></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0;"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt;"><em>Kukukung.</em></span></p><p></p><p></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0;"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt;">&#x201C;Ehh?&#x201D; All of a sudden, the room started shaking. My foot slipped. It wasn&#x2019;t just the shaking, the floor was tilting!</span></p><p></p><p></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0;"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt;">[200 HP has been stored.]</span></p><p></p><p></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0;"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt;">[Entrance opening.]</span></p><p></p><p></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0;"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt;">The ground kept tilting to the sides. The room was divided into four equal parts, with the floor going down at each corner. Depending on where you were standing, each person could fall in a different direction.</span></p><p></p><p></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0;"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt;"><em>Peeok!</em></span></p><p></p><p></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0;"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt;">I couldn&#x2019;t stay upright anymore and fell on my butt. I slid down the high slope helplessly, and darkness welcomed me.</span></p><p></p><p></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0;"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt;">&#x25CE;</span></p><p></p><p></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0;"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt;">I regained consciousness and looked around. On one side of me was a dead end. The other side had a passage. I had fallen into the dead end of a maze.</span></p><p></p><p></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0;"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt;">&quot;Ah, argh...&#x201D;</span></p><p></p><p></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0;"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt;">A moan was heard from outside my field of view. I took a step and saw Scratchy leaning against a wall. He had fallen with me, while the high school girl and middle-aged man were separate. Maybe there was only one wall between us.</span></p><p></p><p></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0;"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt;">Still, the pain had diminished over time so Scratchy was barely moving around. He held a bottle in his hand and was bringing it to his mouth: it was the goblin&#x2019;s medicine.</span></p><p></p><p></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0;"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt;">I immediately pushed him against the wall and snatched the bottle from his hand. At that moment, I felt a sting in my side.</span></p><p></p><p></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0;"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt;">&#x201C;....&#x201D;</span></p><p></p><p></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0;"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt;">Despite his half-closed eyes, I could see a faint triumph of victory flashing in them. He had pricked me with three needles. This guy obviously also had the warden&#x2019;s needles.</span></p><p></p><p></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0;"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt;">&#x201C;Eh... What is this?&#x201D; He had only been acting pathetic.</span></p><p></p><p></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0;"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt;">[Pain Tolerance.

Here.&#x201D; He pulled out 14 needles. I also took the three goblin medicines he had remaining. There were some coins and even an unknown bottle.</span></p><p></p><p></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0;"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt;">&quot;Is this a medicine bottle?&#x201D;</span></p><p></p><p></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0;"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt;">&quot;I don&apos;t know.&quot; I waved the needles in his face.</span></p><p></p><p></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0;"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt;">&quot;I-I really don&#x2019;t know! Someone else took it and just died.&#x201D;</span></p><p></p><p></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0;"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt;">&#x201C;...&#x201D;</span></p><p></p><p></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0;"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt;">It took me a moment to understood those words. I really wanted to prick him with all the needles and abandon him here but&#x2026; &#x201C;Stand up.&#x201D;</span></p><p></p><p></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0;"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt;">&#x201C;Eh?&#x201D;</span></p><p></p><p></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0;"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt;">&#x201C;Lead the way. Stop and report to me if you see anything.&quot; I would use him as a shield.</span></p><p></p><p></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0;"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt;">Unlike the dungeon, the corridor was pitch black. In this situation, I wouldn&#x2019;t be able to see if there was a ranged attack such as the warden&#x2019;s wind gun.</span></p><p></p><p></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0;"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt;">&#x201C;Gi... Give me one bottle of medicine. Right now I don&#x2019;t have much health left...&#x201D;</span></p><p></p><p></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0;"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt;">&quot;Take the lead instead of saying such nonsense.&#x201D; After he stood up, I seized the gloves from him.</span></p><p></p><p></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0;"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt;">[Kung Fu Apprentice&#x2019;s Glove. Equipment item.

Instead, I examined the rank. E. Did this mean an ordinary standard?</span></p><p></p><p></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0;"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt;">Monsters or items belong E rank were nothing special and could be found in reality. But once it reached D rank, there were things like the pills that helped relieve fatigue for 8 hours.</span></p><p></p><p></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0;"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt;">E rank was commonplace, it was something that just wasn&#x2019;t that great. From F rank downwards, the quality was worse than ordinary. From D rank and above, things started to go beyond the ordinary category. That was an approximation, at least.</span></p><p></p><p></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0;"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt;">&#x201C;Hey! I-I&#x2019;m going!&#x201D; Scratchy shouted at me. I was just about to walk forward when...</span></p><p></p><p></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0;"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt;"><em>Jaengurang!</em></span></p><p></p><p></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0;"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt;">A bottle flew from outside my field of view, hit Scratchy&#x2019;s chest and broke. A strange odour spread through the passage. Scratchy started moaning.</span></p><p></p><p></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0;"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt;">&#x201C;...Eh?&#x201D; I could finally see the enemies, and there were three of them.</span></p><p></p><p></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0;"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt;">[Lime Goblin (Warrior).

The bulging belly and strong upper body reminded me of a small gorilla. And... There was one more behind them. I could only see a fuzzy shape in front of me.</span></p><p></p><p></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0;"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt;"><em>Jingle.</em></span></p><p></p><p></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0;"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt;">It shook something and threw it towards me. The upper body was revealed due to its throwing motion.</span></p><p></p><p></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0;"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt;">[Lime Goblin (Pharmacist).

The drugs made will vary depending on the traditions and environment in which the material is procured.]</span></p><p></p><p></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0;"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt;">I couldn&#x2019;t let myself be hit by that bottle. I hurriedly turned my body and it flew in an arc and broke behind me. The smell was enough to make my nose protest. What was it?</span></p><p></p><p></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0;"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt;">&#x201C;Ah, ahh... Ahh...&#x201D; After being hit by the bottle, Scratch was flopping helplessly on the ground and moaning.</span></p><p></p><p></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0;"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt;">Then the goblin warriors came rushing in, each of them with a rusty knife in their hands.</span></p><p></p><p></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0;"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt;">I plunged forward.</span></p><p></p><p></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0;"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt;"><em>Bam!</em></span></p><p></p><p></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0;"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt;">I turned on Limiter Release and punched the face of the enemy in the lead. I followed up by striking its neck and chest.</span></p><p></p><p></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0;"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt;">&#x201C;Kyahh...&#x201D; Was it still standing? Although it was obviously in pain, the goblin didn&#x2019;t collapse. Then another one aimed at my side. I avoided the swinging knife and smashed it in the face.</span></p><p></p><p></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0;"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt;">It wasn&#x2019;t an easy fight, but the narrow passage worked to my advantage. It had allowed me to see the bottle flying towards me and avoid it.</span></p><p></p><p></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0;"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt;">Once one of the goblins couldn&#x2019;t fight properly, the other two were quickly joined his misery. At that moment, the goblin pharmacist disappeared out of view.</span></p><p></p><p></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0;"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt;">&#x201C;Kyah!&#x201D;</span></p><p></p><p></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0;"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt;">I heard the sound of fleeing feet; It was running away. Maybe it lost all the bottles that it was holding. Either way, I soon got rid of the goblin warriors and then it was time to chase the pharmacist.</span></p><p></p><p></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0;"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt;">&#x201C;It hurts! Hurts!&#x201D; I looked back at the scream that reminded me of a child crying and was shocked. It hadn&#x2019;t even been one minute. What had happened in that time?</span></p><p></p><p></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0;"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt;">Scratchy was a bloody mess. Eyes. Nose. Ears. Mouth. Blood was pouring from every visible hole. There were two bottles on the floor.
