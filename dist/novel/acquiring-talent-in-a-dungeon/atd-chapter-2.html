Then what about my phone? I wouldn&#x2019;t be able to make any calls but the light would be helpful. I swallowed my fears and headed down the stairs.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">I had been worried about falling, but it was baseless. After the third step, my vision became dark and the next moment, I was at the bottom of the stairs.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">[1st floor. Arrived.]</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">A cave appeared in front of me. It had stalactites like the ones commonly seen in nature documentaries. However, the tunnel had a regular width.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">I looked back at the stairs with surprise as I wondered how much I had skipped. There was no end to the stairs leading upwards.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">[You are not allowed to step on the stairs again. If your feet touch the stairs, you are out.]</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Okay, I understand.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">I shrugged, but half of it was bravado. Then I started walking in the direction of the cave.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Before I walked a hundred steps, I noticed something strange: there was no light in the cave. In fact, it was complete darkness. However, I was able to identity what was in front of me.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Four metres? Or five metres?</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">A certain range around me was illuminated, like a spotlight was focused on me. Once I moved my foot, the part I stepped to brightened accordingly.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">The boundary between the bright area and the dark part seemed to be drawn with a ruler. I was staring at it when more words appeared.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">[Current floor visibility is normal.

The fact that I couldn&#x2019;t see more than a few metres in front of me was quite burdensome.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">There was a fork in the road. I&#x2019;d come to a cross shaped crossroad with three directions: &#x2018;straight&#x2019;, &#x2018;left&#x2019; or &#x2018;right&#x2019;.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;... This is bad.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">This was a &#x2018;dungeon&#x2019; and it would be a problem if the structure was a maze. The key was the limited field of vision. If everything was visible then it wouldn&#x2019;t be difficult to return to this crossroad again.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">The stairs that I had come down were still visible in the distance. However, it was likely to be very confusing if I could only see a few metres around me.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">I pulled out my cell phone. I hadn&#x2019;t been thinking about making a map in my head. People weren&#x2019;t smart and precise creatures. There was a bit of uncertainty, so I wanted to have as few regrets as possible. I hadn&#x2019;t lived long, but it was a lesson I&#x2019;d had deeply ingrained into my mind.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Phone calls didn&#x2019;t work but the touchpad app was fine. I recorded the brief directions with my finger.

The change came immediately.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">[Cartography LV 1. 4/100]</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">No matter how busy, I was still a teenager who lived in South Korea in the 21st century. The leisure activities that I enjoyed were playing soccer and video games.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">I guessed that the &#x2018;4/100&#x2019; was experience. It was the experience required for LV 2, and at LV 2, the talent would grow like the words said.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">The ability to read and draw maps. Spatial perception. Descriptive ability. And a little bit of memory and visualization. I could feel it already.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">My overall dexterity was bad. Drawing a line on a piece of paper would make it crooked, let alone doing it on a cell phone. But it was different now. The line was noticeably neater compared to before the words had appeared. There was almost no shaking in the strokes.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Wow.&quot;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">A sound of admiration popped out. This was the &#x2018;Cartography&#x2019; talent? Drawing a line on my cell phone wasn&#x2019;t that important. It was just important that I could feel a change.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">There was nothing particularly good about drawing a map. Spatial perception and descriptive ability, I couldn&#x2019;t feel any change right now. However, it was a different story for memory and visualization, even with the &#x2018;slightly&#x2019; attached to it.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">My heart jumped-- the changes were permanent. A change in ability that was meaningful enough for me to notice. Besides, this was just the effect of level &#x2018;1&#x2019;!</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">I&#x2019;d walked a few steps and it was already 4/100. It didn&#x2019;t seem like it would be very difficult to fill up the remaining 96 points. I continued to add to the map on the screen as I walked.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">8/100, 15/100, 24/100...</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">The map was useful. I encountered a few dead ends as well as the overlapping intersections several times. But I never got lost.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Even though I had the map, it was confusing whether or not what I was seeing matched with the map. However, I stayed calm and made the right judgements. This was probably due to the increased spatial perception ability.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">[The level of a talent has risen.]</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">[Cartography LV 1 -&gt; LV 2.

The structure of the cave was indeed a maze. Overall, it had a rectangular shape and there was one part that I hadn&#x2019;t visited yet.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">I had a thought as I headed there. Something was strange. Maze. Dungeon. If so, then something should emerge, whether it was a monster or a treasure box. In fact, I was hoping for the latter.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">If I left the maze without finding anything...</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Eh?&quot;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">As soon as I had that thought I reached the last part of the maze. It was a dead end with a staircase leading down. The stairway underneath the square hole looked like the one in my room.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">In front of it was a square box.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">[Wooden Box. There seems to be no lock. It is possible to smash it.]</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">It said the box could be smashed.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Then letters appeared above the stairs behind the box.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">[Stairs. It leads to the 2nd floor.]</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">[The moment you step foot on it, the current floor exploration is over and you will return from the dungeon. The next night at midnight, you will start on the floor at the bottom of the stairs.]</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">So, it was fixed to one floor per day, but the real point was the next words.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">[Changes in the following floor: Dungeon space has expanded. You can encounter +1 explorer. Monsters below E rank will emerge.]</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Monsters... I trembled at that word but the part before it was more surprising. It meant that I could encounter another explorer like me. If that was the case, did the next floor require some type of cooperative play? Or was it a competition?</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;...&quot;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">I stopped thinking about it. They weren&#x2019;t directly in front of me and I had an object to focus on: the box.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt"><em>Gulp.</em></span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#xA0;I gulped and pushed open the top of the box. &#xA0;The interior of the box was dark. It was a completely black void that showed nothing.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">I put my hand inside the box. In many ways, it was a rash choice.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt"><em>Ching.</em></span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">There was a sound as a mechanism was activated. I felt a cool sensation at my waist. Pain.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;...Eh?&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">My wrist had been neatly cut off by the top part of the box.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;Ah, waaaaaahhhh!&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">A huge pain overwhelmed me and I fell down on my butt. I looked up at my &#x2018;HP Bar&#x2019; and saw that it had been reduced by 1/4.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">[Current Balance: 96/121]</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">[A bleeding state. Health will decrease by 2 every minute.]</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Pain was followed by fear. I lost my hand. The fear of living the rest of my life as a disabled person steamrolled through my mind. I couldn&#x2019;t believe it as I looked down at the bloody stump of my arm. It was a surreal sight as letters rose above the blood.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">[Common wounds suffered in the dungeon will be cured by clearing the floor.]</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">In other words, my hand would return to normal if I headed down the stairs? I felt relieved and immediately stepped towards the stairs. I wanted to escape. The pain of my body being cut was real. I didn&#x2019;t want to feel like this for one more minute...!</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">...But.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">I stopped right in front of the stairs. My body was telling me to go down. Don&#x2019;t hesitate to go down quickly, but at the same time, my head was speaking.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">It was strange. The box was three steps away from the stairs. Don&#x2019;t think about it, go down straight away! No. Think about it.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Wouldn&#x2019;t the trap be useless if they placed it three steps before the stairs? It was like it was trying send me a message &#x2018;Pain? Then quickly go down, down!&#x2019;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">There must be something. If I didn&#x2019;t go down then something would happen. I thought about earlier. The moment that I received Cartography. I once again looked at my HP Bar.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">[Current Balance: 94/121]</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">[A bleeding state.

I stepped back from the stairs.
