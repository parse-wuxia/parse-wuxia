He sounded like a pig had inhaled helium.</span></p><p></p><p></p><p style="padding-left: 0;padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;That...!&#x201D;</span></p><p></p><p></p><p style="padding-left: 0;padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt"><em>Kung.</em></span></p><p></p><p></p><p style="padding-left: 0;padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">He knelt down, dropping the knife as he covered his face with his hands.</span></p><p></p><p></p><p style="padding-left: 0;padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;Kuwaaaaah!&#x201D; A tremendous roar assailed my ears. I turned Limiter Release off and ran forward to punch him in the face.</span></p><p></p><p></p><p style="padding-left: 0;padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt"><em>Crunch.</em></span></p><p></p><p></p><p style="padding-left: 0;padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">The sound came from my fist hitting his face. It was obviously the correct posture for a punch but electricity was transmitted through my wrist. He was hard as a brick. Maybe even harder than that.</span></p><p></p><p></p><p style="padding-left: 0;padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Guah!&#x201D; He swung his arm. The back of his hand hit my belly and it felt like my stomach and intestines had been turned upside down. I literally bounced back.</span></p><p></p><p></p><p style="padding-left: 0;padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;Kuooh... Kuoh...&#x201D; I shook my head and got up. There was blood pouring down his face. Nevertheless, his body wasn&#x2019;t paralyzed. I needed more poison.</span></p><p></p><p></p><p style="padding-left: 0;padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">I started searching. Despite the pendant, my field of view was smaller because my eyes were narrowed. I took careful footsteps and was able to find Yang Su-jin.</span></p><p></p><p></p><p style="padding-left: 0;padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">She was alive. Her eyes were closed and her mouth shut as she surprisingly endured the pain of having her upper body cut off. Indeed, this was her regeneration ability. From her severed upper body, a new lower body could be seen growing. Still, it was quite strange to see the legs of a 5~6 year old growing out of her.</span></p><p></p><p></p><p style="padding-left: 0;padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">...Well. It was an urgent situation so I approached Yang Su-jin. She breathed out and said.</span></p><p></p><p></p><p style="padding-left: 0;padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;I&#x2019;m okay.&#x201D;</span></p><p></p><p></p><p style="padding-left: 0;padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;Ah...&#x201D; Her eyes were touched as she stared into my eyes. ...I wouldn&#x2019;t talk about coming to get the drugs. Instead I used my hands to open her mouth and took out a medicine bottle. I was pouring the second bottle in her mouth when Yang Su-jin suddenly turned pale.</span></p><p></p><p></p><p style="padding-left: 0;padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">I looked up before Yang Su-jin could speak. That person was towering above us, on the verge of throwing a punch. I reflexively kicked Yang Su-jin out of the way.</span></p><p></p><p></p><p style="padding-left: 0;padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">A fist hit my left shoulder. All sensations in my shoulders disappeared.</span></p><p></p><p></p><p style="padding-left: 0;padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;...Uck!&#x201D; I staggered and tried to grab a bottle, but his other hand grabbed my neck. I was lifted up by my throat. In that state, he grabbed my shoulder. It was the side where I had lost all sensations. No, it was my misunderstanding that I lost all sensations.</span></p><p></p><p></p><p style="padding-left: 0;padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt"><em>Jiik, jiiiik.</em></span></p><p></p><p></p><p style="padding-left: 0;padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;Aaaaack!&#x201D; My shoulder was being pulled, just like one would remove a chicken leg from a chicken. I was barely able to retain consciousness. I threw the bottle in my hand with all my strength but...</span></p><p></p><p></p><p style="padding-left: 0;padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;Kik.&#x201D;</span></p><p></p><p></p><p style="padding-left: 0;padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">He moved his head slightly and the bottle fell to the ground behind him.</span></p><p></p><p></p><p style="padding-left: 0;padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Kiaaaahahah.&#x201D; Was it laughter? &#xA0;He put my torn arm in his mouth and started chewing. No, he wasn&#x2019;t chewing but just pushing it in. He was eating my arm.</span></p><p></p><p></p><p style="padding-left: 0;padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">No, now wasn&#x2019;t the time to worry about that. He swallowed from my hand to my shoulder in an instant and smacked his lips like he was satisfied. Then he swapped hands with the one holding my neck.</span></p><p></p><p></p><p style="padding-left: 0;padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">He wanted to tear the rest of my limbs off like I was a chicken.</span></p><p></p><p></p><p style="padding-left: 0;padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">I felt like I was dying as the pain of having my limbs pulled off engulfed me. My vision became blurry as I slowly lost consciousness&#x2026;</span></p><p></p><p></p><p style="padding-left: 0;padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt"><em>Jaengurang.</em></span></p><p></p><p></p><p style="padding-left: 0;padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Suddenly, there was the sound of something breaking and I was dropped. After dropping me, the guy looked back to see that he was soaked due to the bottle that hit him.</span></p><p></p><p></p><p style="padding-left: 0;padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;A-Are you okay?&#x201D; I couldn&#x2019;t see it but it was Yang Su-jin who threw the bottle.</span></p><p></p><p></p><p style="padding-left: 0;padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#xA0;An additional two or three bottles flew through the darkness and hit his chest. No. The location was wrong. Although he was groaning, he was still moving at his fastest speed.</span></p><p></p><p></p><p style="padding-left: 0;padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">It had to be in the middle of the face or directly on the body&#x2026; I lifted myself up.</span></p><p></p><p></p><p style="padding-left: 0;padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">[Current Balance: 54/140]</span></p><p></p><p></p><p style="padding-left: 0;padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">My hand touched something on the ground. It was the bottle that missed before. I grabbed it while still feeling the agony of my missing limb. The bottle was a little cracked but the contents were still fine.</span></p><p></p><p></p><p style="padding-left: 0;padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;Kyak!&#x201D;</span></p><p></p><p></p><p style="padding-left: 0;padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">I could hear Yang Su-jin&#x2019;s scream from outside my field of vision. And at that moment.&#xA0;</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt"><em>Kung.</em></span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#xA0;A sound.</span></p><p></p><p></p><p style="padding-left: 0;padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt"><em>Kung.</em></span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt"><em>Kung.</em></span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt"><em>Kung.</em></span></p><p></p><p></p><p style="padding-left: 0;padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">I held the bottle in my mouth and moved forward. I could see his back. He was hitting the ground with his fist. It was the sound of the guy hitting Yang Su-jin&#x2019;s flesh. I gritted my teeth as I was reminded of my one-armed state, almost breaking the bottle.</span></p><p></p><p></p><p style="padding-left: 0;padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">One step. Two steps. I put as much weight as possible into my leg as I kicked between his legs.</span></p><p></p><p></p><p style="padding-left: 0;padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;...!!!&#x201D; There was no screaming, but I could definitely feel the response in his body. Also, his genitals weren&#x2019;t as hard as his face.</span></p><p></p><p></p><p style="padding-left: 0;padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">One step again. My hand hit his genitals. I hit him so hard that my HP was reduced by 14 points.</span></p><p></p><p></p><p style="padding-left: 0;padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;Kiiiiik!&#x201D; The guy stumbled and slipped on the pieces of Yang Su-jin&#x2019;s body. His head literally slammed against the ground. Yang Su-jin, nice assist!</span></p><p></p><p></p><p style="padding-left: 0;padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">The bottles that Yang Su-jin held were scattered on the ground. I grabbed as many as I could hold in one hand, along with the one in my mouth.</span></p><p></p><p></p><p style="padding-left: 0;padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">The guy&#x2019;s hands were holding his groin. I opened his mouth and poured the bottles in my hand down his throat.</span></p><p></p><p></p><p style="padding-left: 0;padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;Keok..!&#x201D; A hand was raised and he threw me away. I was thrown back but all the bottles in my hand were already gone. In fact, I didn&#x2019;t have a hand at all. I had shoved my hand with the bottles down his mouth, and the tightening of his throat was so strong that it tore my wrist off.</span></p><p></p><p></p><p style="padding-left: 0;padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">However, all the drugs had definitely entered him. The drug was immediately effective.</span></p><p></p><p></p><p style="padding-left: 0;padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;Keok! Ukukuk! Uck!&#x201D; He never got up again.</span></p><p></p><p></p><p style="padding-left: 0;padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">A tremendous amount of blood poured out from his eyes, nose, mouth and even genitals. It poured out so much that it almost seemed like a broken pipe.</span></p><p></p><p></p><p style="padding-left: 0;padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">[Unique talent has been acquired.]</span></p><p></p><p></p><p style="padding-left: 0;padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">[Unique Talent - No.005.

There was the sound of something rolling around outside my field of view.</span></p><p></p><p></p><p style="padding-left: 0;padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">I took one step.. Oh my god. It was a head. Her eyes were closed but new flesh was growing from her neck. This caused the head to move and make sounds.</span></p><p></p><p></p><p style="padding-left: 0;padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">I sat down next to Yang Su-jin&#x2019;s head. As her neck and clavicles regenerated, her eyes opened. Was it to look at me?
