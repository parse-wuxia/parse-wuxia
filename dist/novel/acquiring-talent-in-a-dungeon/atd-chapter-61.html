 <p><span style="">Chapter 61 - &#xA0;Day 13, 10th Floor Big Picture (5)</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p><p><span style=""> I was shocked. </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;...&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">It was for another reason. Over 2,000 people were prostrating themselves before me on the ground. </span><span style="">They were also wailing. </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;King!&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Savior!!&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">They said those words.&#xA0;</span><span style="">King and saviour. It was my new packaging. The main entrance of the castle had a very gentle and wide slope. After gathering the residents there, Mino addressed them. It had only taken 30 minutes. </span></p><p><span style="">&quot;The king has decided to take me as his wife.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">In those 30 minutes, I became a saviour that would restore the glory of the past, which was different from the &#x2018;demons.&#x2019; It was the second time I felt admiration today, after the big guy&#x2019;s use of the axe. I felt like my choice was right. I only memorized the vocabulary words and combined them to use in conversation. The pronunciation and nuances of my Tellan wasn&#x2019;t that good. </span></p><p><span style="">Although I couldn&#x2019;t completely feel how brilliant her speech was due to the language barrier, I couldn&#x2019;t help being impressed with Mino. An incredible voice and pressure came out from a girl of around 20 years old. </span></p><p><span style="">&quot;How great.&quot; I unknowingly exclaimed once her speech was over. </span></p><p><span style="">Mino looked at me with surprise before laughing. &quot;Now they are Your Majesty&#x2019;s as well.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">It was like she said. Even though the harsh words &#x2018;your lives belong to him&#x2019; came out in the speech, the inhabitants seemed to respond to that even more. </span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Then let&#x2019;s go.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Yes.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">I walked through the castle with her guidance. </span><span style="">It was the opposite of the castle&#x2019;s top floor. There was a room in the basement where the treasures were originally stored. Now it was empty and an altar was the only thing there. </span></p><p><span style="">I stepped up to it. </span></p><p><span style="">[Neutral Zone - Castle: Lewin. &#xA0;Integrated.] </span></p><p><span style="">My view changed. &#xA0;Just like the other day, I was up in the sky. Every time an integration was taking place, it was possible to observe the newly added territories from the sky. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">Talia. Forest. The factory. &#xA0;The newly added &#x2018;Lewin Castle&#x2019; was attached to the south of Talia. Originally, it was the most remote place in my area, but not anymore. There was an area to the south of Lewin Castle. </span></p><p><span style="">[City: Vermouth] &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">[Neutral Zone - Campi Reservoir] </span></p><p><span style="">Lewin was located between two cities. I narrowed my eyes. There were people around the perimeter of Lewin. All the inhabitants had been instructed to enter Lewin Castle, so they must be from the cities. </span></p><p><span style="">They were the inhabitants of the forest and Jin Soo-young&#x2019;s &#x2018;Vermouth.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">I went down to Talia. The inhabitants of the forest saw me coming down from the sky and ran over. </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What&apos;s going on?&quot; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;King! They...&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">After hearing Kino&#x2019;s explanation, it wasn&#x2019;t difficult to predict the situation. Jin Soo-young&#x2019;s Vermouth was a city where the buildings and culture remained intact. The value of the relics were high, but the Tellans living there suffered from a lack of food and water. This didn&#x2019;t change after Jin Soo-young occupied the city, but then it was integrated with Talia. Although it wasn&#x2019;t tasty, there was no need to worry about starvation. We had the Kasava. </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;They want to distribute the food but... The guards didn&#x2019;t listen to us when we tried to stop them.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">All of the Tellans here were now my citizens. The golems wouldn&#x2019;t kill any citizens. </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Stop.&#x201D; I waved my hand towards the elder explaining the situation. </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;K-King.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Don&#x2019;t panic, I don&#x2019;t plan to neglect you.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">I headed straight to Lewin Castle. I was greeted with cheers at Lewin Castle. They didn&#x2019;t know about the fighting outside, but they could see a new world before them. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Your Majesty.&quot; Even Mino, who remained calm in front of the residents, was flushed with excitement. </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I have something for you to do.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;...Yes!&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&quot;There is a conflict outside. It&#x2019;s between residents who know me already and those who don&#x2019;t.&#x201D; I briefly described the situation to Mino. </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Can you do it? If it is too difficult then I will...&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&quot;No, it&apos;s fine.&quot; Mino looked at me with a determined expression. </span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I will scold them harshly for making trouble for Your Majesty. Everything belongs to Your Majesty, and me as well.&quot; </span></p><p><span style="">There was a slight anxiety in her last words. Maybe it was because she could actually see Talia now. It was a heavenly scene that she witnessed for the first time in her life. She couldn&#x2019;t believe that she really was the owner of this place. </span></p><p><span style=""> &#x201C;Yes.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">She needed to be convinced again of &#x2018;who she was&#x2019; in this place. I laid a hand on Mino&#x2019;s shoulder. </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;You are my queen.&#x201D; After that, I walked behind Mino. Mino left to instruct the residents in a solemn voice. </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;You. My. Queen.&#x201D; Jin Soo-young, who was leaning against a wall, imitated my tone and ridiculed me. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;You have played the king. Are you a king now? Your Majesty?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&quot;How can that be? Princess-nim?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">The conversation seemed to be an exchange of compliments, but there was a degree of sarcasm if one listened closely. </span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I&#x2019;ll carry you.&quot; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;...I don&#x2019;t want to.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Don&#x2019;t be stubborn. Really.&#x201D; I put a hand under her legs and on her back. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Euh...&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I&#x2019;ve met a lot of crazy girls lately, but you are probably at the top of the tower.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Did Japan call this a princess embrace? &#xA0;No matter how busy, there was no way eyes wouldn&#x2019;t gaze at me as I walked down the castle. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">Jin Soo-young complained, &quot;C-Change your posture. Just uphill...&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Didn&apos;t I tell you? Don&#x2019;t be stubborn.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;...&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Remember this next time you are injured.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">I headed down from the castle towards Talia. &#xA0;After entering the city, the army of Lewin Castle was already moving in unison to successfully control the two forces with no blood loss. </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;...Great.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;...It is great.&#x201D; Jin Soo-young said in a reluctantly approving tone. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Honestly don&#x2019;t think about it. There is an insurmountable gap between you and I. What is this?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;This crazy bastard!&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Jin Soo-young jerked away with a shout, then she flinched as it agitated her injury. Then I dropped her to the ground. I sat on a bench while Jin Soo-young recovered her breathing. &#xA0;Her HP had almost reached the limit so I pulled out a medicine from my inventory. </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;.... </span></p><p><span style="">She looked at it with surprised eyes. &#x201C;...Tha...nk you.&#x201D; &#xA0;Jin Soo-young accepted it. </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;It doesn&#x2019;t really matter to me. You should watch your mouth a little bit. There are two things that you have to put up with. Being weaker than me and being a small dog that barks at the strong.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;...Are you strong?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Then am I weak?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">I got up again, this time intending to go back to business. I helped Jin Soo-young up. </span></p><p><span style="">&quot;In addition, this isn&#x2019;t a little world... It is really bad for a woman to swear like this.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;...A real jerk.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Jin Soo-young didn&#x2019;t show any resistance as I assisted her towards the central stairway. She opened her mouth once we were in front of the stairs. </span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Now you should be vigilant. You don&#x2019;t know when I will kill you.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Indeed, a girl with a dirty mouth will have a dirty mind.&#x201D; I put Jin Soo-young down by the stairs. </span></p><p><span style="">There were many things to worry about on this floor. Maybe the biggest purpose was to show my abilities to Jin Soo-young. As I said, Jin Soo-young wasn&#x2019;t an idiot. It wasn&#x2019;t enough to imprint &#x2018;you can&#x2019;t kill me&#x2019; into her. I didn&#x2019;t know what was going to happen, but if she noticed a gap, then she was going to try and kill me. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I will become the emperor.&#x201D; I told Jin Soo-young in a serious voice. </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;...He. The ruler of this world?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Let&apos;s see? I think my opinion has changed recently, but if I become the emperor of this world, it won&#x2019;t be different from becoming the emperor in reality. </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;...&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">She couldn&#x2019;t kill me, rather than don&#x2019;t kill me.</span></p><p><span style="">I was far above Jin Soo-young. I wanted to instill the fact in her mind that there wasn&#x2019;t much value in stabbing me in the back compared to following me. </span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Go down the stairs first.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;...You?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I have a lot of work to do here today.&#x201D; I also wanted to check the result of the experiment. </span></p><p><span style="">&quot;When you see Director Oh, tell him that we met some Chinese explorers.&#x201D; I was going to roll Jin Soo-young down the stairs. </span></p><p><span style="">&quot;W-Wait a minute.&quot; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I have one thing to ask.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">I raised an eyebrow. Jin Soo-young spoke with a serious expression. &quot;Will you sleep? With that woman?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;...&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What? I...&#x201D; I pushed Jin Soo-young down the stairs. </span></p><p><span style="">&amp; </span></p><p><span style="">The contents of my experiment weren&#x2019;t much. </span></p><p>The Chinese swordsman. I didn&#x2019;t kill him. Once his body was in a critical state, the roots of his desires were extracted.</p><p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">He wants to kill.</span></i> <i><span style="">Those taller than himself.</span></i> <i><span style="">Also a big body.</span></i> <i><span style="">All the good-looking people...</span></i></p><p><span style="">It was a review of the &#x2018;tasty part&#x2019; that the sacred creature ate. Complex. I had expected a little bit, but it was very precise. Perhaps he changed his physical inferiority complex into combat power? Of course, there was a risk, but obtaining a unique talent would have a food effect. </span></p><p><span style="">However, I had no intention of taking it. Unique talents weren&#x2019;t the only sweet parts. The root of his desire was a desire based on an inferiority complex related to the body. If he obtained a better body, then the sense of inferiority would lessen... Wasn&#x2019;t it similar to a mental state? </span></p><p><span style="">That&#x2019;s why he fed the sacred creature. He instructed the sacred creature to eat the desire itself. </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hey. Still nothing?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">I asked the sacred creature but there wasn&#x2019;t a reply. The sacred creature almost screamed as it devoured the Chinese man&#x2019;s desire. &#xA0;Shortly after that, the sacred creature fell asleep straight away. Well, I just guessed that he was asleep. It was probably due to a sudden sense of satiety. </span></p><p><span style="">Anyway, I did an experiment with the Chinese man in that state. I placed a ticket in his hand and tore it. </span></p><p><span style="">My &#x2018;servant&#x2019;, Jin Soo-young came to me after I occupied the area. But generally, others would be forced out as soon as I took over an area. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">But what about this? What if a ticket to the 5th floor was used? It was an item that would automatically return a person to the place it was torn after 12 hours. </span></p><p><span style="">The Chinese man was already half dead. Once he returned to reality, he wouldn&#x2019;t have a significant influence due to his desires being eaten. However, he might be able to stay in the occupied area using this method. It was a loophole that I could use. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">The remaining time was about 10 hours. </span><span style="">I wouldn&#x2019;t be able to do anything until that time was over. </span></p><p><span style="">I turned around and looked at something, then threw my tired body on the bed. </span></p><p><span style="">I was currently in the upper level accommodation. It was a pretty luxurious room. I didn&#x2019;t know what the material was, but the sheets and cushions covering the bed were smooth without feeling old. </span></p><p><span style="">There was a mild scent. I closed my eyes. </span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Your Majesty.&quot; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;...&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">I opened my eyes, sat up and saw Mino. She reported with both hands clasped in front of her. </span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Everybody has obeyed Your Majesty&#x2019;s authority without any problems. No one was hurt or killed except for two people who clashed before the first suppression occurred.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;...Well done.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">I rubbed the sleep from my face and removed my feet from the ground, placing them back on the bed. </span></p><p><span style=""> &#x201C;I&#x2019;ll be sleeping now. Then...&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">There was no meaning. There was still a lot of time left, and I didn&#x2019;t need to intervene in anything. </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Now... Is that what you are saying?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes. Now.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Recently, I didn&#x2019;t have a lot of time to lie down like this. I&#x2019;m going to take a nap, so take care of everything. </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Please.&#x201D; I lay down and closed my eyes. As I felt a weight on the other side of the bed, I realized two things. </span></p><p><span style="">My skills in Tellan were still poor. &#xA0;I used simple words and often didn&#x2019;t understand the meaning of idioms. &#xA0;For example, &apos;sleep.&#x2019; I opened my eyes. </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;...&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;...&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">The second thing was that I just thought of this as a good place to stay. &#xA0;As king of the castle, it was natural to take the best room in the castle. </span><span style="">The best room in the castle. Then whose room was it? You stupid bastard. </span></p><p><span style="">&quot;So... If you look...&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">I hadn&#x2019;t thought of it. But I needed to say something now. She was trembling in front of me right now. Ah, she had mistaken my words and had taken off her clothes right away. She didn&#x2019;t need to do that. </span></p><p><span style="">I had to admit my mistake and take responsibility. As the coffee coloured skin neared my nose, the identity of the scent coming from the bed became clear. &#xA0;Suddenly, I remembered what Jin Soo-young said before she descended. </span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Pff.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Mino&#x2019;s nervous face became grouchy because she thought I was laughing at her. </span><span style="">&#x201C;Why... Do you...?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;No. I&#x2019;m sorry.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">I solemnly apologized. I tried my best to keep my manners.</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p>
