<p><span style="">Chapter 26 - Day 7, Alley</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p><p><span style="">One billion won. I used to think about it often. When I was a high school student, I didn&#x2019;t have a lot at home, so I thought about the things I wanted to have.</span></p><p><span style="">After going to college, I had to wear the same old clothes that I had worn for many years, and realized that the things my friends enjoyed were a luxury to me. Just... I didn&#x2019;t need anything. I just hoped for a little more money.&#xA0;</span><span style="">At least, it used to be like that. </span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Hey, do you have your bankbook?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Yoon Sang-ah stared at me with a confused expression. &quot;I don&#x2019;t understand what you are saying right now...&#x201D; She didn&#x2019;t know exactly, but she could roughly guess.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Legitimate. By today. One billion won. Don&#x2019;t you understand?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;This frustrating guy...&#x201D; </span><span style="">The man, Yoon Sang-min, opened his mouth for the first time.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;It&#x2019;s to avoid being pursued by the law, my&#xA0;proposal won&#x2019;t be a problem. Is there any reason to refuse my terms?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;There will be a record.&#x201D; &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">He gave an answer right away.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;There will be an inquiry when you get a job, so it will just be seen as a dubious monthly salary.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;So?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I don&apos;t know what type of life I will live in the future, but&#xA0;I don&apos;t want to do anything.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">I could hear some laughter. The other people sitting in the cafe were laughing at me.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;You can become a big person.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Maybe you can even run for President.&#x201D; They spoke nonsense as they laughed, but I didn&#x2019;t bother looking at them. I just studied Yoon Sang-min.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;So legally. I want a clean one billion.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;It&#x2019;s awkward. The reality is that there&#x2019;s no way to satisfy the condition of giving you one billion by today. If those conditions...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Then I guess I have to refuse. Realistically.&#x201D; I shook my head. Many eyes looked at me like I was crazy as I opened the door to the cafe. </span></p><p><span style="">I could hear Yoon Sang-ah from behind me. &quot;How funny. A beggar wearing a t-shirt is going around like he&#x2019;s some big shot.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Laughter burst out. I kept moving. One billion won. It wasn&#x2019;t a small amount of money. With that amount of money, I could live a life of ease. So why did I refuse now that it came into my hands?</span></p><p><span style="">What if it wasn&#x2019;t one billion, but five billion or ten billion? Maybe I would&#x2019;ve been satisfied.</span></p><p><span style="">That was before entering the dungeon. I was different now. I have become physically stronger. I was a little smarter and more willing to take action.</span></p><p><span style="">And I would be even better in the future.&#xA0;</span><span style="">I had to continue for as long as possible. Until the day when it was impossible for me to struggle any longer. The words I said to Yoo Sang-min and Yoo Sang-ah were true. I hadn&#x2019;t been talking nonsense.</span></p><p><span style="">It would be good if they &#x2018;gave&#x2019; all that money to me. Then I would be able to stop along the way and smell the roses.</span></p><p><span style="">But not anymore. A long road stretched in front of me. I would do the things I wanted to do. I would walk the path I chose and be successful. To the me right now, one billion wasn&#x2019;t enough as a goal.</span></p><p><span style="">I walked out and left the campus. I had to wait a bit for the next step.</span></p><p><span style="">&amp;</span></p><p><span style="">Late at night. I was walking down a street when I received a message.</span></p><p><em><span style="">-If you are alone now then you should contact me.</span></em></p><p><span style="">The call came straight away.</span></p><p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">H-hello? This is Yoon Ji-hee.</span></i></p><p><span style="">It was the number that she gave on the way to the cafe.</span></p><p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">Excuse me...</span></i> <i><span style="">So the money...</span></i></p><p><span style="">&quot;Please give me the cell phone number.&#x201D; Yoon Ji-hee swallowed her breath. The number shouldn&#x2019;t be repeated twice. </span></p><p><span style="">&quot;If &#xA0;you let me know, then I will protect you on the assumption that there won&#x2019;t be any problems with my safety in the future.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">S-still...</span></i></p><p><span style="">&quot;If you do not want to die...&quot; I hung up and waited. Three minutes later, I received a message. I entered the phone number I received and took a breath. I closed my eyes before pressing the call button. The ring tone continued for a while.</span></p><p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">Who is this?</span></i></p><p><span style="">I heard the voice of an elderly man. &#x201C;I called about a matter regarding one of your grandchildren. Yoon Ji-hee.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">- </span><i><span style="">... This is a number that is only used in my family.</span></i> <i><span style="">Did Ji-hee give it to you?</span></i></p><p><span style="">The old man&#x2019;s voice was grumpy. &#x201C;Yes. I sincerely asked Yoon Ji-hee to tell me. It is a condition to escort Yoon Ji-hee inside the dungeon.&#x201D; There was a moment of silence. Then Chairman Yoon Sang-gyu spoke again.</span></p><p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">I made it clear to my grandchildren.</span></i> <i><span style="">No matter what the children do in there, I decided not to intervene.</span></i></p><p><span style="">The old man spoke in a feeble voice, but the weight behind his words was fierce. Was it to make the opponent shrink back from the weakness?</span></p><p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">So I can&#x2019;t give you anything.</span></i> <i><span style="">I think it is better for you to hang up.</span></i></p><p><span style="">Of course, I already knew that. Yoon Sang-ah told Yoon Ji-hee that she was acting on her own behalf, not on UZ Group&#x2019;s. &quot;I&apos;ll didn&#x2019;t call Chairman-nim for nothing.&#x201D; I calmed the trembling in my chest and spoke. &quot;I will protect your granddaughter. I will do my best and she will be the one who stays until the end.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">You and Ji-hee?</span></i> <i><span style="">What is the relationship?</span></i></p><p><span style="">&quot;Until yesterday, we had no affiliation.&quot; The chairman didn&#x2019;t hang up. Okay. Then I would continue. &quot;Even if you don&#x2019;t intervene, I don&#x2019;t think you have a lot of expectations for Yoon Ji-hee. I met three of your grandchildren today, but I could clearly see who would die first.&#x201D; From here on, I cut to the chase and pulled the pin from the hypothetical grenade.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;But Yoon Ji-hee will survive the longest. If only one of your grandchildren is left, it will be Yoon Ji-hee.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">Why?</span></i></p><p><span style="">&quot;She has me.&quot; I heard a faint laugh.</span></p><p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">In other words, the grandchild that has you...</span></i> <i><span style="">Perhaps Sang-ah and Sang-min...</span></i> <i><span style="">You are better than those children.</span></i></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes. I am the ace in the hole. The two of them... Even if they have the people that they&#x2019;ve already gathered, I will still win.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">Hrmm.</span></i></p><p><span style="">&quot;In addition, none of your grandchildren are better than me. So naturally, Ji-hee will stay the longest.&#x201D; What did I want? I said it first before the old man could ask. &quot;As you said, you won&#x2019;t be giving me anything right now. Anyway, if my words are proven correct...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">You won&#x2019;t need to ask for anything since I will do it.</span></i></p><p><span style="">The old man&#x2019;s voice was filled with laughter. Yes. He was right. If Yoon Ji-hee survive longer than any of her siblings or cousins, it meant she would be the successor of the UZ Group. And I would have been responsible for the safety of the successor.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I just wanted you to know. This is your insurance against damage. Even in the worst situation where the dungeon surpasses the ability of your grandchildren, it is insurance that at least once grandchild survives.&#x201D; The next moment, the old man&#x2019;s loud laugh entered my ears.</span></p><p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">That is fine.</span></i></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Thank you.&#x201D;</span></p><p><i><span style="">-Yes, then should I call the other children and tell them not to hurt Ji-hee and the person who is calling?</span></i></p><p><span style="">Goose bumps formed on my spine. I hadn&#x2019;t said it yet.</span></p><p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">Sang-min more than Sang-ah...</span></i> <i><span style="">That child feels a desperate sense of urgency.</span></i> <i><span style="">I&#x2019;ve told him several times to be vigilant to other parties.</span></i> <i><span style="">I can&#x2019;t stop him.</span></i></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;...&#x201D; Even though there was no hope, I wanted him to keep his grandchildren in check, at least in reality. It was for my personal safety rather than Yoon Ji-hee&#x2019;s. I knew he was going to say that.</span></p><p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">Ah.</span></i> <i><span style="">Don&apos;t worry about it.</span></i> <i><span style="">This business is okay.</span></i> <i><span style="">Free insurance.</span></i> <i><span style="">It is free so I will take care of it.</span></i></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Thank you.&#x201D;</span></p><p><i><span style="">- I personally feel sorry for Ji-hee since she isn&#x2019;t the type to make an active move or to play dirty.</span></i> <i><span style="">Tomorrow, I will tell the children.</span></i> <i><span style="">Now, is that all?</span></i> <i><span style="">Can I hang up?</span></i></p><p><span style="">&quot;That&apos;s it. Thank you for listening to my words.&#x201D; Just before the call was disconnected, the old man suddenly spoke.</span></p><p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">I haven&#x2019;t heard your name.</span></i></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ah...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">Well...</span></i> <i><span style="">It doesn&apos;t really matter right now.</span></i> <i><span style="">I don&#x2019;t know about later, but there is no point knowing your name now.</span></i></p><p><span style="">I heard a short laugh.</span></p><p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">Then, work hard.</span></i></p><p><span style="">The call was disconnected.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;... Hah.&#x201D; I let out a long breath. I did it. I hadn&#x2019;t stuttered, nor did my voice shake, despite my heart racing quickly. With lighter footsteps, I entered an alley lined with buildings.</span></p><p><span style="">As re-development proceeded in this area, more than half the buildings were empty. There were places where the streetlights had gone out. It was annoying during the day, but it was even worse at night. I stood in front of a building and examined the mailbox installed outside the entrance.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;You&apos;re living in a place like this?&quot; I turned around to see several people in the side alley. The alley on the other side had people as well.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;It&#x2019;s surprising. I didn&#x2019;t think such a great person would live in a place like this.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Originally, great people are frugal. Can&#x2019;t you tell by looking at his t-shirt?&#x201D; They moved forward and narrowed the distance. Two people on the left. Two people on the right.</span></p><p><span style="">They were people that I saw at the cafe--those who followed Yoon Sang-ah and Yoon Sang-min.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Who sent you?&quot; I could roughly guessed but I asked anyway.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Wah, did you hear? He asked &#x2018;who sent you?&#x2019; I just now realized it was a drama.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I have goose bumps.&#x201D; The tallest of the two on the right spat out.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;You never know. You didn&#x2019;t want money so we came to persuade you in another way.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Are you planning to use violence?&#x201D; I raised my head and looked around.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Well, in some cases... It&#x2019;s as I thought. This neighbourhood looks pretty good. No one seems to be here, and there doesn&#x2019;t seem to be proper CCTV.&#x201D; There was a guy who was already shadow boxing in the air.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Whatever happens, it is because you angered the people behind us. You shouldn&#x2019;t have rejected them.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;... I see.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Wah. Look at that calm expression. As expected from a great person.&#x201D; They were getting closer and closer.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;If you&#x2019;re scared then why don&#x2019;t you rush into your house, lock the door and call the police? Of course, we already know the location of your house so we will always be here. I saw the mailbox you were looking at. You&#x2019;re not very smart, are you?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Indeed. I took out my gloves. </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What? Do you plan to fight?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;It looks like it. What should we do?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Then let&#x2019;s call the police.&#x201D; They wouldn&#x2019;t do such a thing. If the police came to catch me then they would get caught as well. I didn&#x2019;t think that Yoon Ji-hee would get a lawyer for me.</span></p><p><span style="">So&#x2026; They picked this place.&#xA0;</span></p><p>&quot;The police wouldn&#x2019;t believe it anyway.&#x201D;</p><p><span style="">This neighbourhood wasn&#x2019;t where I lived. Of course, this building wasn&#x2019;t mine. The mailbox that I was looking at also had nothing to do with me.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Eng?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;What did you say?&quot; There was no one else around. The lighting was dim. It was an area where the CCTV was underdeveloped. I had searched for a suitable place during the daytime.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hey, grab him.&#x201D; They headed towards me at the same time. I twisted my neck and chanted something in my head.</span></p><p><span style="">Activate. Darkness Cloud.</span></p><p><span style="">A darkness that was darker than the night wrapped around us.</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p>
