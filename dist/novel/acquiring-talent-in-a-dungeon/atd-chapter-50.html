<p><span style="">Chapter 50 - &#xA0;Day 12, 9th Floor Dog</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Really... A creepy bug.&#x201D; &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">The human who came in a while ago. </span><span style="">The sacred created had a taste. It was a type of flavour? It felt perky from devouring Yoon Chan-hee just a moment ago. No, it was more than that. </span></p><p><span style="">This person tasted &#x2018;rough.&#x2019; &#xA0;An unrefined, raw material. A tree that had a stem but hadn&#x2019;t yet found the direction to grow in. Well, the sacred creature didn&#x2019;t dwell on the details of the delicious meal. It had just eaten the most delicious thing and now the second tastiest had come to it. </span></p><p><span style="">Hee-chul took a fighting stance. The sacred creature that devoured Yoon Chan-hee was the size of three adult men. He judged it to be a physical opponent and was ready to fight. </span></p><p><span style="">The sacred creature rushed straight forward. Hee-chul raised his fist and shouted. &#xA0;&#x201C;...!&#x201D; However, the sacred creature didn&#x2019;t have a solid form and Hee-chul&#x2019;s fist hit the air. Soon the sacred creature penetrated him. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">There was an image of another world as hell began. </span></p><p><span style="">&amp; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;...Heok! Heok!&#x201D; &#xA0;Chang Ga-ram sighed with relief as the ice fell down. &#xA0;&#x201C;Heok...&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">His arms were a mess from just two kicks. He endured the pain and looked around. The life span of the flares scattered around was almost over. </span><span style="">It wasn&#x2019;t hard to see the devastation. &#xA0;Other than him, everyone else was dead. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Nonsense... No...&#x201D; </span><span style="">Chang Ga-ram was in a panicked state as he headed towards the hatchery. Hee-chul had clearly headed to the place where Yoon Chan-hee was. &#xA0;&#x2018;Leader-nim... If he is caught...&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">It wasn&#x2019;t just the loss of lives. It was all the possibilities that Yoon Chan-hee had. </span></p><p><span style="">He greatly improved the amount of experienced gained by guiding a person&#x2019;s propensities and talents. Research had already been done on the differences in experience gain according to the &#x2018;quality&#x2019; of the individuals. &#xA0;Yoon Chan-hee was the conductor who moved his subordinates. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">Now this bastard had driven Chang Ga-ram to the edge of death. Yoon Chan-hee clearly believed that Chang Ga-ram&#x2019;s power alone could solve the problem. Chang Ga-ram didn&#x2019;t fulfill his responsibilities. </span></p><p><span style="">It was over. Close to 20 potentials had disappeared. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">He didn&#x2019;t seem to realize that both arms were broken as he moved his feet. &#xA0;Somehow, he needed to help Yoon Chan-hee. He wanted to apologize. &#xA0;&#x201C;...Leader-nim?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">At that moment, he saw Yoon Chan-hee on the opposite side of him. </span><span style="">For a moment, Chang Ga-ram didn&#x2019;t think it was Yoon Chan-hee. The person in front of Chang Ga-ram was strange. There was no focus in his eyes and saliva was dripping from his mouth. </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I-I&#x2019;m really sorry. Leader-nim! I...&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Go.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;...Huh?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Yoon Chan-hee staggered but Chang Ga-ram barely kept him upright with his injured arms. The generator could be seen over Yoon Chan-hee&#x2019;s shoulder. </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;...!&#x201D; Kim Hee-chul had collapsed in front of the generator and was experiencing spasms. He was still alive. &#xA0;&#x201C;L-Leader-nim. This...&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">He didn&#x2019;t understand what was happening on the other side, but his body shook like he had wandered into a nightmare. However, the certain thing was that Yoon Chan-hee was in front of him while Kim Hee-chul was acting like that. </span><span style="">They would be able to kill him. If Yoon Chan-hee could kill him then he would recover from the damage he suffered... </span></p><p><span style="">&quot;L-Let&#x2019;s go!&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;...!?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style=""> Yoon Chan-hee shivered. </span><span style="">Once again, Chang Ga-ram was forced to doubt that the person in front of him was truly Yoon Chan-hee. He was always a calm and cool guy. A strong person who wasn&#x2019;t confused no matter what he encountered and always found the best solution. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What... I know what you are thinking...&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">There was only fear. Just like a dog in a fight, Yoon Chan-hee&#x2019;s only choice was to succumb to it. </span></p><p><span style="">&quot;B-But he... Kill...&#x201D; Yoon Chan-hee looked back. &#xA0;The fear in his eyes was enhanced as he saw Hee-chul. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Something will come out.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&quot;If we...&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;No, you can&#x2019;t... I refuse. It is impossible. So... We have to go. Go. Go. Huh? Let&#x2019;s go. Please.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Chang Ga-ram got goose bumps. He would dismiss it as nonsense, but Yoon Chan-hee was like an idol to him. &#xA0;That idol was now looking like this. It seemed like he had completely lost the thing that made him shine. Chang Ga-ram didn&#x2019;t know what the enemy&#xA0;was, but he couldn&#x2019;t afford to handle it. </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;...I understand.&#x201D; Chang Ga-ram lifted Yoon Chan-hee. &#xA0;He turned around in order to leave the incubation room. </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;...&#x201D; However, he looked back at Kim Hee-chul one last time. Yoon Chan-hee must have experienced something like this. The spasms on the ground looked really painful. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">It wasn&#x2019;t a situation for Chang Ga-ram to worry about Hee-chul, let alone feel sympathy. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">&amp; </span></p><p><span style="">I held my neck. &#xA0;&#x201C;Keo&#x2026;&#x201D; &#xA0;A moan emerged from my mouth but the pain wasn&#x2019;t physical. My real body was lying on the ground. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">Was this a dream? Or was it my imagination? I was back in my original body. It wasn&#x2019;t the strong body from the dungeon, but a weak desk-bound body. The reason why I couldn&#x2019;t move my body was the worm clinging to my neck. </span></p><p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">It is easier if you give up.</span></i></p><p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">It will happen regardless of what you do.</span></i></p><p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">I want more.</span></i></p><p><span style="">It wasn&#x2019;t my words that were constantly echoing, but the worm&#x2019;s. &#xA0;The worm kept talking to me. The voice imitated me, causing an irritating sensation. It was just like what I felt just before freezing to death due to Chang Ga-ram. That helplessness that bothered me all my life until I entered here. </span></p><p><span style="">I closed my eyes tightly. </span></p><p><span style="">It was a dream mouth, but I bit my lip so hard that it bled. Somehow, I needed to do something to get this worm off me. Although the pain was effective, the pressure only weakened for a short while. </span></p><p><i><span style="">Bam!</span></i></p><p><span style="">Strong hands grabbed my head and slammed it into the ground. Images of several people protruded from the head of the worm. They were people who I knew. The shape that suppressed my head was my father&#x2019;s. </span></p><p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">I told you to stop.</span></i></p><p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">People should know when to give up.</span></i></p><p><span style="">My father&#x2019;s voice sounded normal, but all the power drained from my body. I was a child again. In my childhood, I was a child who had to follow the voice of my parents, who had absolute power over me. </span></p><p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">You can&#x2019;t get everything you want in life.</span></i></p><p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">Isn&#x2019;t this selfish?</span></i></p><p><span style="">This time, it was my mother&#x2019;s voice. &#xA0;Another hand touched my neck. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">Hey.</span></i> <i><span style="">Is anyone out there?</span></i> <i><span style="">Everyone is preparing for private tutoring.</span></i> <i><span style="">Do you have money to prepare for the contest?</span></i></p><p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">I know you worked hard, but these are the results.</span></i></p><p><span style="">There were my teachers from middle school, high school and university. In addition, some school sunbaes and employers. &#xA0;In my life, there were always voices and hands pushing me down from above. </span><span style="">Finally, I heard the last voice. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style=""> -</span><i><span style="">Give up and submit to me.</span></i></p><p><span style="">It was the first time I&#x2019;ve heard this voice. A mysterious voice. &#xA0;It contained more authority than my father in my childhood. Softer than my mother. The voice made it feel like the owner had everything. </span></p><p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">You are weak.</span></i></p><p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">Stay still and just listen to me.</span></i></p><p><span style="">I started struggling. But my body didn&#x2019;t move. Numerous hands were holding me down and their voices were speaking in unison. Follow their commands. Say yes. Relax. </span><span style="">No, I couldn&#x2019;t relax. I knew how easy it was to entrust my will to the people above me. But, it wasn&#x2019;t an important issue. </span></p><p><span style="">...</span></p><p><span style="">....... </span></p><p><span style="">My elementary school years. </span></p><p><span style="">The lessons I had after school. I didn&#x2019;t remember much save the musical instruments. At that time, it was the most interesting and fun thing that I had done. After going a few times, I had to quit the lessons after school. My parents thought it was an &#x2018;expensive hobby&#x2019; and useless. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">That wasn&#x2019;t the only thing I remembered. &#xA0;It was just the oldest memory in my head. </span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;This isn&#x2019;t something that just anyone could do. If you don&#x2019;t have talent then you&#x2019;ll regret it later. It&#x2019;s better not to look at it.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style=""> That was what my parents said. There was no regret in their words. It wasn&#x2019;t something that could be done as a career, and they doubted that I had the talent. But it wasn&#x2019;t because of my parent&#x2019;s cold evaluation that I spent the next few nights sniffling. It was because I couldn&#x2019;t touch the instrument that had given me so much fun.&#xA0;</span><span style="">They just dismissed it, despite the fact that it wasn&#x2019;t what I wanted to do. </span></p><p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">Why are you fighting so hard?</span></i></p><p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">You won&#x2019;t be able to resist anyway.</span></i></p><p><span style="">Why? </span></p><p><span style="">I had been asking myself that same question on the road I had been walking so far. In fact, I answered it several times. &#xA0;Why fight, when it wouldn&#x2019;t make a difference? In my position, what more could I gain? </span></p><p><span style="">It didn&#x2019;t matter. &#xA0;Even if I had nothing to gain... I might flop to the ground because I had failed miserably. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">But this was all through my will. &#xA0;Only my will. My choice.&#xA0;</span><span style="">I didn&#x2019;t want my will to be crushed by someone else. No matter how strong they were, their relationship with me or the rights they had, I would ignore the disgusted gazes from above me. That was it. </span></p><p><span style="">I just wanted to climb up. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">[The conditions are met.] </span></p><p><span style="">[Talent has fully awakened.] </span></p><p><span style="">My body twisted. </span></p><p><em><span style="">-...?</span></em></p><p><span style="">The voice sounded confused. &#xA0;&#xA0;This unlucky bastard. </span></p><p><span style="">In the end, it was just a worm. I didn&#x2019;t know what its identity was, but I wouldn&#x2019;t be adversely influenced by it. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">My body started to change. Anyway, this place wasn&#x2019;t real. It was just an illusion. I peeled off the weak flesh. My body grew longer. Rough hairs grew all over my body and claw like nails emerged on both hands and feet. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">What?</span></i> <i><span style="">Why, just...</span></i></p><p><span style="">I turned my head. My snout became longer and sharp teeth bit at the thing around me. The worm shrieked. More hands appeared on my body and tightened the pressure, but I didn&#x2019;t care. My teeth had already reached it. </span></p><p><span style="">I just bit. I tore at it with my claws and bit in. </span></p><p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">It hurts!</span></i> <i><span style="">Hurts!</span></i></p><p><span style="">The voice sounded like a little child. This unlucky bastard. The worm was already caught. I bit it as it cried painfully and struggled. &#xA0;I didn&#x2019;t remove my teeth, I just continued biting. </span></p><p><span style="">Continue. Continue. Continue... </span></p><p><span style="">&amp; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;...Ah.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">My eyes opened. I was looking at the ceiling of the incubation room. It was the feeling of returning to my body. I had regained consciousness. Of course, my body wasn&#x2019;t in the form of a beast either. </span></p><p><span style="">It was reset. </span></p><p><span style="">[Unique Talent - No.099 Underdog: &#xA0;The conscious overcoming of challenges that are higher than yourself. &#xA0;Even though you know you can never get it, you are a dog constantly barking at the sun.] </span></p><p><span style="">[A correction value is applied when fighting against an enemy whose total sum of abilities is more than twice your own.] </span></p><p><span style="">[Complete immunity to all types of mental interference including morale, brainwashing, oppression etc.] </span></p><p><span style="">As I raised my body, I found something wriggling near my feet. It was the worm. It had shrunk quite a lot compared to its previous size. I could hold it in one hand. At first glance, I could see that its life was about to end. It wriggled like a bug that had been sprayed with insecticide. </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;...&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Without hesitation, I reached out for it. Unlike before, this time I could touch it. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Son of a bitch.&quot; &#xA0;Even though I overcame the situation, I still felt angry about it. I prepared to use strength to crush the worm. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Don&#x2019;t hate it too much.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;...&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&quot;It was just ignorant. In fact, it&#x2019;s a pitiful existence. Even though it&#x2019;s a sacred creature, it wasn&#x2019;t born in the arms of a god.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">A Tellan woman suddenly appeared in front of me. She wore clothing that made her look almost naked. She was shining with a gentle halo that illuminated the surroundings. </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;... You.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">I smiled slightly and relaxed. &#xA0;The woman was an existence that I knew. I just couldn&#x2019;t believe it. </span></p><p><span style="">&quot;You&#x2019;ve had some plastic surgery done.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Thanks.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">The sun god... No, the goddess smiled at me.</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p>
