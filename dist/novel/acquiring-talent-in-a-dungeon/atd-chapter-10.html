I just measured the distance I would have to run to subdue Yoo Su-jeong.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Don&apos;t worry. I have no intention of fighting with Hee-Chul ssi.&#x201D; The dagger she stabbed into An Su-hyun&#x2019;s neck disappeared from Yoo Su-jeong&#x2019;s hand. Yoo Su-jeong held out her empty palms in the front of her like she wanted to show she meant no harm.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;I knew he wouldn&#x2019;t win, but I didn&#x2019;t think he would look so stupid.&#x201D; She touched An Su-hyun&#x2019;s head with her toes. Even though she cut his throat, the amount of blood that spurted from An Su-hyun&#x2019;s neck was abnormal. An Su-hyun&#x2019;s body rolled down the stairs. Once it stopped, the HP Bar above An Su-hyun was completely empty.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">[Out]</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Only his cold body was left behind. &#x201C;Well, bye.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Like it was a signal, she started running. She ran three or four steps towards the staircase in the narrow passage. I was lacking by a few steps. By the time I reached the staircase, Yoo Su-jeong had already stepped onto the safe stairs to the fourth floor and disappeared.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;...&quot;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">I turned around.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">I approached An Su-hyun to confirm his condition but it was already too late. Even when it was touching the stairs, the body didn&#x2019;t disappear.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Dammit.&quot;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">It was the first death I faced, and it was completely gruesome. The light had disappeared from his eyes. He didn&#x2019;t deserve to die just for his sin of being human.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Anyway, I couldn&#x2019;t think about the body any more. I couldn&#x2019;t do anything. Instead, I needed to focus on the things I could do. I lay An Su-hyun back down and went back to the hallway. There was still nothing in the pouches of the goblins except for coins. Then I checked the first goblin warden.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">[Crude Wind Gun. Equipment item.

This decreases by 0.2 per minute.]</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">There were a total of 10 needles. I headed to the second goblin warden.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">[This wind gun can no longer be used.]</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">I scavenged another seven needles. It subtracted the three that were used on me.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">As a result, I had a total of 17 poisoned needles that caused pain. Even if I didn&#x2019;t use the wind gun, I could just prick the opponent with it. I felt a lot of pain, so anybody else without Pain Tolerance would be almost paralyzed.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Or&#x2026; With this, I could raise the level of Pain Tolerance. This time, I moved towards the boxes.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt"><em>Pak!</em></span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">The first box contained a trap.

I smashed the next few boxes. From the fourth box, five porcelain bottles emerged. A foul smell came from the corks covering the opening of the bottles.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">[Crude Porcelain Bottle]</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">[There is no way of knowing the contents.

Either way&#x2026; I would try it once. A ring emerged from the sixth box. It was a thin silver ring that females commonly wore. There seemed to be elaborate carvings on it, but there were so many scrapes that it was hard to check the patterns.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">[Old-fashioned Ring.

Well.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">The seventh box was a trap. And the long-awaited eighth box. A book came out. It was old but was made out of luxurious leather with designs on it. I opened it to see strange letters inside. At first glance, it was a narrow font similar to Arabic.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">[Old Leather Hardcover Book]</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">[Information to decrypt language: Knowledge related to the language is required.]</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Thus, I got everything I could from the boxes.

I lay halfway on the edge of the stairs. If I became sick or there was something strange, I could just roll down. I closed my eyes and swallowed the contents of the bottle. It felt like drinking the snot from a runny nose.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">[Current Balance: 28/129]</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">[Current Balance: 30/129]</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Huh?</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">I felt good.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">[The Lime Tribe&#x2019;s Medicine.

It could be thought of as having four more lives. If so, what about the pills? With higher expectations than before, I carefully unwrapped a pill and placed it in my mouth.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">...This. Sweet? It felt like I was eating a sweet potato soup without the stickiness.

When I read the description, it said that I only lost consciousness for 10 minutes but that wasn&#x2019;t what my body was saying. It felt like I had been sleeping for 8~16 hours.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">The areas where the needles hit me were now completely fine. If that was the case, could I use this in reality? It was practical. It was a miracle medicine that could almost double my day. ...How many more things could I get from the next floor?</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Before I went down the stairs, I looked at the stairs in the narrow passage. Yoo Su-jeong had gone down these stairs. Then the stairs where An Su-hyun&#x2019;s body was.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Yoo Su-jeong had run away from me. I couldn&#x2019;t give up going down the other stairs just to chase her. Her judgement was right. I would go down the unique staircase. There were many more rewards waiting below.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">One day we would meet again on the floors below. Could I kill a person? No, it might not be an important problem. I didn&#x2019;t want to be like An Su-hyun. If I hesitated then I would die before achieving what I wanted. I needed to obtain everything I could get my hands on. Even though the goal was clear, the means was the problem.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">I stepped on the stairs.

I turned my head and locked gazes with another pair of eyes. The place where I was standing now was a room lit up with lights, just like the hallway.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">There was a man was in front of a staircase, his body covered in scratches. His age and height seemed to be similar to mine, but his shoulders were wide and his arms were long. At first glance, I could see that he had a well-disciplined body.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">There were thick gloves on both hands.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;...&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">His eyes were examining me. At first glance, he gave off a strong impression. A so-called &#x2018;gangster image.&#x2019; He looked like a person who was never far from violence.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;What are you looking at, you motherfucker.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">I looked weaker than him.

Bring it on, I&#x2019;ll smash you.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;What is this?&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">As there was a third cry, both of our heads turned in surprise. There was another staircase.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">The person was a middle-aged man that was at least 190 cm tall. Tattoos were exposed on his thick forearms. His meaty hands were holding a knife. He looked this way and frowned as he realized the atmosphere.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">He looked a little nervous. Three beasts. Everyone was silent as we didn&#x2019;t dare rush carelessly. A suffocating tension filled the room.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">However, all three of us were looking at one point in the room. There was one last staircase remaining.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">That&#x2019;s right. The room was square. There was one staircase at each of the four corners. Soon, the fourth beast would be coming down the stairs. Like the other three, the person who came down from the third floor would be a beast.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">It was the reason why everyone was vigilant. Seconds passed that felt like a long time. The shape of a person appeared on the stairs.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;Eh? This... Kyaaak?!&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">As the fourth person made a surprised scream, the other two beasts&#x2019; eyes widened. A girl in her late teens had showed up. She was wearing the school uniform of a high school in my area.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;Ah, ah, ah... Hello...&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">As the weakest creature spoke in a quivering voice, the other two somewhat relaxed. I didn&#x2019;t do such a stupid thing. Although it was just a guess, I felt sure she was the most dangerous predator.</span></p><hr><p></p><p></p></div><p></p>
