Frankly, it would be a lie if I said I wasn&#x2019;t complacent. I&apos;m obviously not a genius.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">But I still thought I was a little more special than ordinary people.

My body seemed to be able to move more easily than usual. The shaking had also stopped to a certain extent.

But I didn&#x2019;t feel like Cartography became slower after reaching level two. The limit had been raised from 100 to 200 so it wasn&#x2019;t right that the rate should reduced.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Perhaps&#x2026; Although it had been very painful awhile ago, I had now grown accustomed to the sensation. Did the experience slow down because the pain I felt was lessened? I looked up at the HP Bar.

I just didn&#x2019;t know if I could put it into action. I raised my body, standing slowly.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">I turned and faced the wall that I had been leaning against. I took one step back with my left foot, while my right foot was half a step forward.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">I lifted both arms, well one healthy hand holding a wrist with no hand. My shoulders were in the proper position and I prepared to throw a punch. Ah. My cut wrist couldn&#x2019;t form a fist. Truly.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;... Hah.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Anyone who heard it would be terrified. I honestly admitted it. Yes. I was completely ruined. Were my legs shaking? This was the craziest thing I would ever do. That time when I rode my dad&#x2019;s bike up a high hill and closed my eyes as I went down? Well. I didn&#x2019;t think it was so crazy now.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">I laughed and punched the wall.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;Ack!&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x25CE;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">I briefly lost consciousness.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">[Pain Tolerance.

I used every last strength to raise my head.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">I was stretched out on the ground.

I had to go down the stairs. There was no strength in my legs. My belly was damp. Blood? It was the smell of urine. There was also a lot of it. I gritted my teeth and turned over. I could see both arms in front of me as I crawled.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Let&#x2019;s say there was a tree branch. If it was cut with a knife then the section was very neat.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Then it was given to an active child. The child played with it, used it to draw pictures in the sand and took it to a playground. It was used to kill some ants, maybe a few earthworms or mantises as well.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Now, think about that cut section again. The end of my right arm looked similar. There was no sensation anymore. That&#x2019;s why I stopped gaining experience. How many times had I hit the wall? I remembered exactly two times.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">No. I didn&#x2019;t want to think about it.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">I didn&#x2019;t want to think about it.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">I hated thinking about it.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">I wouldn&#x2019;t think about it.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Go to the stairs quickly. I used the cut off section of my wrist as a cane and crawled forward slowly. This way was faster. I didn&#x2019;t have any sensations anyway.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">[Current Balance: 4/121]</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">[A bleeding state.

A bug with no wings or legs. What would it do in the future? What was I talking about?

But I felt so pleased and thankful as I finally realized the value of it.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">I belatedly realized that I was crying. I dried off my tears and looked at the clock. 8:18 am. That meant I had awakened around 6 a.m.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">I got up from the bed and stretched to loosen my tense muscles. Everything was the same as it had been before I went to sleep.
