During testing periods, the cafes that were open on weekends wouldn&#x2019;t be that busy. I headed straight to a cafe.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x25CE;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Oh, I want to sleep forever.&quot; &#xA0;After silently working on the algorithm on the paper for two hours, Su-yeon put down her mechanical pencil.

One person picked a problem, squeezed their head and shared the solution with the others. Well... Smart people didn&#x2019;t need to do this. The fact that I was at O University meant there was a lot of effort and talent, but the geniuses were really beyond my imagination.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Uh, the one Oppa is starting is a problem I tried the other day.

I think I did everything...&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Su-yeon-and Dong-wook turned to face me. &quot;Already?&quot;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">I handed over my piece of paper instead of answering. Their eyes widened with surprise as they looked over it.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Wah.&quot; Su-yeon&#x2019;s mouth dropped open.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;... Hey, you must have seen this beforehand.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">She didn&#x2019;t believe it. Dong-wook stared at me. &quot;That isn&#x2019;t the Hee-chul I know.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Dong-wook beckoned to the other two people in the room.

I felt like this was nothing. However, it was the first time I had been faced with a problem of this difficulty.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">I spoke a few words to the members of the study group before suddenly looking at the clock. Ah. It was that time already&#x2026; &quot;Oh, I will leave first. I&#x2019;m going, Hyung.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">I hurriedly gathered my things on the table. Originally, I would have stayed until one or two in the morning. &quot;What, has Hee-chul&#x2019;s confidence increased due to the studying?&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;It&#x2019;s not like that.&#x201D; I couldn&#x2019;t say that I was going to a dungeon, so I just said goodbye and left the study room.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;Oppa.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">I looked back to see Su-yeon following me. &quot;That thing that Oppa did a while ago.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;Huh?&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;That paper, can I have a look at it?&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Her hands joined together in a shy gesture but my hands were already opening my bag. Anyway, I was a normal Korean male in university.

I&#x2019;ll return it.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Su-yeon accompanied me to the elevator outside the study cafe.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;Hee-chul oppa...&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;Huh?&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">As the elevator door opened, Su-yeon suddenly blurted out, &quot;I&#x2019;ve thought this for a long time but you sure are hard-working.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;Eh...&#x201D; I couldn&#x2019;t reply and waved my hands. Su-yeon also waved at me. The elevator doors closed.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;Hah.&#x201D; Hard-working. The words weren&apos;t wrong. I probably wouldn&#x2019;t have been able to reach this far without working hard.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Originally, I wouldn&#x2019;t have been able to solve the problem. But it wasn&#x2019;t uncommon. It was hardly the first time I had been unable to solve a problem. Maybe the abilities I gained in the dungeon helped.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;It is still insufficient.&#x201D; I thought back. Su-yeon and Doon-wook&#x2019;s story. I wasn&#x2019;t a genius and there were many people superior to me. Even if I did well, I was a long way away from being a genius. There was quite a few people who could do what I could.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Even Su-yeon was outstanding enough to enroll in a science high school for exceptional children. It was the same for the other study group members. Yes, it was still insufficient.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Abilties.

It was An Su-hyun. Did he arrive a little earlier because he stepped on the stairs before me? He wouldn&#x2019;t be running away due to my arrival.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">There must be something else; something that terrified An Su-hyun. I had to maintain my vigilance. I could hear footsteps, but they were different from An Su-hyun&#x2019;s footsteps that had already disappeared. They were a &#xA0;little slower and lighter.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Kuoh...&#x201D; A rattling sound.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Then the owner of the footsteps came into view.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">[Lime Goblin (Worker).

No, it wasn&#x2019;t unfortunate. I raised both fists.

I realized after taking a few steps that there was a change in the dungeon.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">On the first and second floors, the dungeon was a &#x2018;cave.&#x2019; Although the paths had a certain width, there were stalactites on the walls. But on this floor, bricks was laid on the outer walls of the caves, despite a significant number of them crumbling.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">There were traces of collapsed pillars and arches. There were traces of marks on the walls that used to be pictures. I could see that they weren&#x2019;t drawn by the same people who built the ruins. The cave murals were unveiled in the areas where the bricks had fallen down.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">It was the work of the goblins. The pictures were red like they had been drawn in blood. They were simple pictures reminiscent of ancient civilizations such as Egypt or the Mayans.

To be honest, I was a bit scared.

I kicked An Su-hyun&#x2019;s ankles with my foot. &#x201C;Ah!!&#x201D; An Su-hyun flinched and immediately swung his bat.
