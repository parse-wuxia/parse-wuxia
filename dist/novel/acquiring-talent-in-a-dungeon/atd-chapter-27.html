<p><span style="">Chapter 27 - &#xA0;Day 7, Preparations</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p><p><span style="">The blood vessels in my whole body felt tight. It was like the pain when donating blood, amplified by 10 times. There wasn&#x2019;t a physical HP Bar above my head or a message in front of me. It was different from the letters that popped up when looking at an item.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;W-what?&#x201D; Four confused voices echoed in the darkness. The range of darkness was just as I thought. It was the same range of vision like in the dungeon. I aimed my fist at the closest one. The blitz tactic was the key. I didn&#x2019;t know what variables the four opponents had so it was best to utilize the advantage of surprise.</span></p><p><i><span style="">Bam!</span></i></p><p><span style="">As soon as the guy collapsed from being hit in the stomach, the one next to him swung a club at me. He couldn&#x2019;t see, but it seemed like he was responding accurately and quickly to the sound. Of course, it was a blind hit but it might work because it was a pincer attack.</span></p><p><span style="">I moved my head, grabbed his wrist and pulled back his arm. There was the sound of something breaking. Every time I dealt a blow, the pain in my blood vessels gradually faded. The blood-sucking effect worked without any problems.</span></p><p><span style="">There was the feeling of someone kicking me from behind, but I gritted my teeth and withstood it. The pain was severe but I could endure it. I turned around. This time the kick was a bit higher. However, it missed and the leg moved to the side, causing the person to stumble.</span></p><p><span style="">The remaining person didn&#x2019;t come directly. He hesitated while holding a bottle in his hand. It was because a disaster could happen when it missed unlike the colleagues who swung a fist. The person was only a few steps away, so I killed my footsteps and approached immediately.</span></p><p><span style="">I grabbed the bottle and lightly kicked his testicles. The problem was the next step. Their shouts and screams rang through the alley. There was no guarantee that someone wouldn&#x2019;t exercise their courage.</span></p><p><span style="">I quickly dragged them to a building that was being redeveloped. As I entered through the tarps covering the outer wall of the building, there was nothing to be seen.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;If a sound leaks out of your throat then you will die.&#x201D; Of course, I was bluffing. There were grunts as I punched three of them in the abdomen. The one left was the supposed leader.</span></p><p><span style="">He was the one watching me quietly. I pinched the flesh on the inside of his forearm with my index finger and thumb, then twisted it painfully.</span></p><p><i><span style="">Quark!</span></i></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ugh...!&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">I didn&#x2019;t know how powerful my grip was after being influenced by the lizardman essence, but he received pain when I used only a little bit of my power.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What is my name?&#x201D; I saw this in a novel. The detective said that asking questions like &#x2018;what is your name?&#x2019; made it harder to hide their thoughts instead of yes or no questions.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I-I don&#x2019;t know! We just followed...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;That is enough. Be quiet.&#x201D; From here on, I was going to test the talents and techniques I acquired in the dungeon. How efficient were &#x2018;Compulsion&#x2019;, &#x2018;Eloquence&#x2019; and &#x2018;Charisma&#x2019;?</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Kim Sung-tae. Lee Ji-hwan. Kim Sung-ik. Jang Hyo-jin.&quot; I took out their cell phones, removed the batteries, and read their names on the ID cards in their wallets. I read the addresses written below. It was significant.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;A-Are you crazy? This isn&#x2019;t the dungeon... We didn&#x2019;t plan anything other than a simple assault. Killing us is too much. Our instructions were just to scare you a little...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Of course, those are just words.&#x201D; I tried to laugh like a psycho as much as possible. The effect was obvious. Even though I didn&#x2019;t say the word &#x2018;kill&#x2019; myself, they had already imagined a snuff film in their minds. The leader&#x2019;s name was Kim Sung-tae.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Sung-tae. The problem with attacking me is that I will pay you back. Not only that, I was insulted as well.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;What should...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Make me feel better. If I feel better, I might not use your cell phone to call your family.&#x201D; The other three looked at me nervously as they carefully listened to my words. &quot;Are there any facts I should now? Things that I might not know about the dungeon? Points will be given to the person who tells me first.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">It didn&#x2019;t take long for the first answer to come out. The person called Jang Hyo-jin spoke first.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Well, you don&#x2019;t need to be in the place where the stairs were originally.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Huh?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;So even if you are in the bathroom or someplace else... As long as the space is isolated, a staircase will appear at midnight.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Oh?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The experiences from individuals were quite specific. I looked at Kim Sung-tae. &quot;Your employer was experimenting with this?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;...&#x201D; An expression of embarrassment was his answer. They had probably done such experiments.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;With this, I don&#x2019;t have any bad feelings towards Jang Hyo-jin. Does Sung-tae&#x2019;s silence represent the rest of you?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Kim Sung-tae hesitated before speaking. If two people were in the same place, then one staircase would be created. However, stepping on the same staircase wouldn&#x2019;t cause the stairs to overlap. If someone went into the dungeon with an injury, that injury would be healed when they left the dungeon. </span></p><p><span style="">Once I listened to the experiment, I asked a few additional questions before saying. &quot;They are pretty safe experiments. Have you never tried an experiment like this?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What...?</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Killing a person outside the dungeon and seeing if you can absorb their abilities.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;C-Crazy!&#x201D; Kim Sung-tae forgot his position and spat out.&#xA0;</span><span style="">&#x201C;Hey... There are still some lines we shouldn&#x2019;t cross. I don&#x2019;t know what thoughts you are having but... I told you. This is real life. It&#x2019;s nonsense to think like that.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;That is true.&#x201D; I put a falsely evil expression on my face.</span></p><p><span style="">I released the expression. &quot;This is somehow quite awkward to say.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;...?&#x201D; As they looked at my expression, saliva thickened in their mouths. I noticed it. I was mocking them until now. In fact, it was a little fun deceiving them. I knew more than anyone else the limit as a psycho. If they were murdered then the risks to me were enormous.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;If it is like this...&#x201D; I placed my hand on Kim Sung-tae&#x2019;s head as I pondered aloud. I placed strength into my wrist and shoved his head down on the ground. After lifting Kim Sung-tae&#x2019;s head again, his face had become bloody.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ugh...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;No matter how angry, don&#x2019;t forget your position now.&#x201D; He was the one who told me that when you entered the dungeon, your wounds will disappear. After two hours, the evidence will disappear. It didn&#x2019;t matter what I did as long as they didn&#x2019;t die.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Give me all the items you have.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I can see from your reaction that this isn&#x2019;t sufficient. You should worry about each other.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Noises were heard from one side. The three people, except for Kim Sung-tae, were already scared. I collected all the items, such as clubs and bottles, and stored them in my inventory.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Coins?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;We don&#x2019;t manage the money or supplies...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I see.&#x201D; I nodded. I checked the time and went to work. I started beating the four people up. </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I-I gave you the items! There is no more, really!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I know.&#x201D; I showed them the time on my cell phone. &quot;There are approximately two hours left. Anyway, if you stay here then the staircase will appear.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Once you entered and exited the dungeon, your wounds were restored. This meant that when they entered the dungeon, their wounds would be maintained. I didn&#x2019;t know if the goblin&#x2019;s medicine could restore broken bones. However, they would have to consume quite a lot of medicine on the seventh floor and would have to worry about all types of disadvantages.</span></p><p><span style="">They might have to eat their medicine to an extreme level. If they were with colleagues from the fifth floor, they might become meals for several people.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I&#x2019;d appreciate it if you convey my thanks. Tell them that this is just fair play for what they tried to do.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Three of them gave up. Kim Sung-tae maintained his spirit until the end. After it was over, he said to me. &#x201C;Again... Do you want to consider it again?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;The ship you are on is rotten. I saw it. Earlier at the cafe, I heard it from Sang-min and Sang-ah.&#x201D; These people were acquaintances of the Yoon siblings? They felt like the entourage of a chaebol child that often appeared in dramas.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;... Everyone misjudged. You are a great person. Now I know it for sure. I mean, the words that were said... I&#x2019;ll make Sang-min recognize his mistake and reevaluate you.&#x201D; Despite his blurry eyes and bloody lips, Sung-tae seemed quite strong-willed.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Based on the system of the dungeon, a small number will survive. I am sure I will meet you again. Honestly, to say that I don&#x2019;t have any bad feelings right now... It would be a lie. But that&#x2019;s just the way I feel. If you join then Sang-min will surely get closer to being the final one... Of course, he will also give you sufficient compensation.&#x201D; A so-called loyalist.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I&#x2019;ll say it once again... Yoon Ji-hee is rotten. Maybe she will do something unexpected... After her father died, she grew up with a mother who is a third rate actress. Did you know that?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hrmm.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Rather... You might get caught around the ankle, compared to your profits... It is like picking up an empty bowl compared to a bowl of rice. If you want to get far in the UZ Group...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Nothing like that.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I have no intention of joining UZ Group. In the first place, it doesn&#x2019;t seem like a company that can support me after I graduate.&#x201D; I got up.</span></p><p><span style="">Kim Sung-tae stared at me with disbelieving eyes. But it was true. After hearing the story of succession from Yoon Ji-hee, if Yoon Sang-ah and Yoon Sang-min hadn&#x2019;t entered at that moment, I would have killed Yoon Ji-hee on the seventh floor and neatly separated from the problem.</span></p><p><span style="">It was too reckless to get involved in such a fierce competition due to Yoon Ji-hee. However, Yoon Sang-min and Yoon Sang-ah had given me a hint. At the cafe, she had unintentionally provided me with extra information.</span></p><p><span style="">Just one thing. I had made one mistake when judging Yoon Ji-hee. This was it.</span></p><p><span style="">I was sure after hearing the information. That&#x2019;s why I refused the suggestion to kill Yoon Ji-hee and even called the chairman. I was sure. Secure Yoon Ji-hee, not the UZ Group.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Well, I guess your words are correct.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;... Then why...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;But you and those cousins, have you ever wondered&#xA0;what greed is after you entered the dungeon?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;...?&#x201D; I think I found the answer. After knowing this, it made a lot of sense. It wouldn&#x2019;t matter if anyone else knew. Rather, those who knew the answer would snort with laughter. Maybe I had already known.&#xA0;</span><span style="">When I looked at it, I could see the practical meaning. </span></p><p><span style="">I left the construction site. Quite a lot of sound should&#x2019;ve leaked into the outside world, but in the end, the police didn&#x2019;t come. As I headed home, I messaged my school friends. It was to obtain some information about Yoon Ji-hee&#x2019;s academic life.</span></p><p><span style="">The last person I sent a message to was Yang Su-jin.</span></p><p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">What about the errands?</span></i></p><p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">I&#x2019;ve prepared everything.</span></i> <i><span style="">Should I bring it in my bag?</span></i></p><p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">Yes.</span></i> <i><span style="">Good work.</span></i></p><p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">I&#x2019;ll see you inside!! &#x263A;&#x263A;</span></i></p><p><span style="">I took a shower and packed the things into my bag. Then I waited for&#xA0;the stairs.</span></p><p><span style="">[7th floor arrived.]</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p>
