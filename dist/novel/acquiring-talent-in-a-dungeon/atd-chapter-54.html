<p><span style="">Chapter 54 - &#xA0;Day 13 Princess and Dog (1)</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;...!&#x201D; Director Oh, walking urgently after me, stopped in his place. &#xA0;I turned and looked at him. </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What... T-There is a way you can fix Soo-young?&#x201D; He asked.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I&#x2019;m not sure. There is one way that might work.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">That alone was enough for someone who had fallen into despair. The mother suddenly took hold of my wrist. She was crying so badly that I could barely understand what she was saying. </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;...Child... Her father is the president of this country. I-I mean...&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Madam.&#x201D; Once Director Oh realized the unusual state of the First Lady, he gestured for the room to be cleared. &quot;Please calm down before talking again.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Director Oh took me to a corner of the room. &quot;What are you up to? Can you really fix her? What is the method?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I told you that I&#x2019;m not sure. I received a clue after seeing her.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&quot;If there was such a thing, then you should&#x2019;ve told me first.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Of course, this situation who would&#x2019;ve then ended much more quietly. But I had spoken to the First Lady who didn&#x2019;t know much about this. Director Oh wasn&#x2019;t an explorer like Kim Tae-hyun, who was aware of the dungeon and how amazing it was, so he might not believe me. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">However, if there was even a &#x2018;possibility&#x2019; of restoring Soo-young to normal, then he would have to try it. He would ask me about the method and then write it up in a report. It would go to her father, the president, who would give permission or not. I changed things by going directly to his wife. </span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I-I&#x2019;m okay now! So let me talk!&#x201D; It was the First Lady who had calmed herself down. &#xA0;As far as I knew, the First Lady was an ordinary housewife who only got a university education. She didn&#x2019;t know much about the dungeon and the public affairs, but she was the president&#x2019;s wife. </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;...I guess you&#x2019;ve made some calculations. I&#x2019;m tired of talking to you.&quot; I said to Director Oh.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Shouldn&#x2019;t you personally explain it?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I think that Kim Tae-hyun should be fine. It has already become like this.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">I said bluntly and Kim Tae-hyun walked over to the First Lady to explain. I inwardly spoke. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;The delicious smell is coming from the female right?&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">Yes.</span></i></p><p><span style="">The worm, no the dog answered. </span></p><p><span style="">&apos;What is that smell exactly? Apart from me, do the rest of the people here have it?&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">Other prey.</span></i> <i><span style="">They don&#x2019;t smell delicious.</span></i> <i><span style="">There won&#x2019;t be much to gain if I eat them.</span></i> <i><span style="">I don&apos;t want to eat.</span></i></p><p><span style="">I thought about his words. </span></p><p><span style="">&apos;You said you could smell it, but I smell differently from the one you ate in the dungeon.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">Huh?</span></i> <i><span style="">Dungeon...?</span></i> <i><span style="">What is that?</span></i></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;...? </span></p><p><span style=""> -</span><i><span style="">I-I&#x2019;m sorry but I don&#x2019;t know.</span></i> <i><span style="">Don&apos;t bite me.</span></i> <i><span style="">Don&apos;t scratch me.</span></i></p><p><span style="">The sacred creature seemed a bit stupid. I felt like there was nothing wrong with his head, but he didn&#x2019;t know anything about the basics. It was natural since he was just born. After repeating a few questions, I was able to get the answers that I wanted. On the ninth floor, there was no&#xA0;prey that smelled delicious other than&#xA0;Yoon Chan-hee and me.</span></p><p><span style="">I walked over to Soo-young. &#x201C;#%@#%@#%%%.&#x201D; She cursed in Korean. But due to the emotional and urgent tone, it sounded like an alien language. I felt it before, but it contained an obvious hatred. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">Of course, I had never met this woman. In addition, her hated wasn&#x2019;t only directed towards me. She didn&#x2019;t care even when looking at her mother. </span></p><p><span style="">&apos;You are able to get rid of people&#x2019;s desires.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style=""> -</span><i><span style="">...What is desire...?</span></i></p><p><span style=""> &#x2018;I mean, is it possible eat that power?&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style=""> -</span><i><span style="">Yes!</span></i> <i><span style="">I can do it!</span></i> <i><span style="">I want to eat!</span></i></p><p><span style="">He noticed quickly. A puppy jumped out of her chest and ran straight towards her. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style=""> &#x2018;Hey. Don&#x2019;t eat yet...&#x2019; </span></p><p><i><span style="">Kung.</span></i></p><p><span style="">But he couldn&#x2019;t penetrate her skin. The puppy raised his paws to his head and started crying. He looked at me like he was seeking answers. </span></p><p><span style=""> -</span><i><span style="">I can&#x2019;t go in.</span></i></p><p><span style="">I remembered what Isaiah said. He was a creature that had to depend on humans. Now he would call me Master. If so, could he only feed on my desires? The puppy&#x2019;s face looked at me very carefully. </span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;What?&#x2019; </span></p><p><i><span style="">-Touch the food.</span></i> <i><span style="">Then I might be able to.</span></i></p><p><span style="">I put my hand on Soo-young&#x2019;s head. The dog jumped back into my chest and a change suddenly appeared. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;@#<a href="email-protection.html" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="a98de9">[email&#xA0;protected]</a>#%%....&#x201D; Soo-young&#x2019;s eyes shook, but I couldn&#x2019;t feel anything directly. </span></p><p><span style="">&apos;Hey, stop. Stop eating.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">It was encouraging that he could do this, but it was too soon to tell if this would cure her. I lifted my hand from Soo-young&#x2019;s head. But&#x2026; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;This...#%@##%@#%&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">What? Within a few seconds, Soo-young&#x2019;s eyes were restored to their original state. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">I see. This guy&#x2019;s &#x2018;meal&#x2019; was the desires that were constantly springing up. It seemed correct when thinking about what desire was. Then what about Yoon Chan-hee? I asked but Isaiah never helped me directly. </span></p><p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">Digging up the roots won&#x2019;t create something delicious.</span></i></p><p><span style=""> If it kept eating, then it would run out of food. </span><span style="">In other words, Yoon Chan-hee had been eaten to the &#x2018;roots&#x2019; and couldn&#x2019;t recover immediately, while the sacred creature only had a light taste from Soo-young. &#xA0;If so, it was impossible for his madness to be cured. </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes. Do you think the method will work?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Director Oh&#x2019;s voice was heard. I got up. </span></p><p><span style="">This was it. &#xA0;The best conditions. &quot;Of course.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Just now... I tried to contact the president but he is busy with matters of state and I wasn&#x2019;t able to talk to him.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Ah. Of course. Director Oh&#x2019;s voice sounded slightly nervous. &#xA0;He knew that whatever I wanted, it would be impossible to give it to me with just the authority of the wife. Therefore, I wouldn&#x2019;t heal this woman even if I knew the way. That was what he thought. </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ah. It doesn&#x2019;t matter.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">I looked behind me. I saw Director Oh and the First Lady. </span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I think I can improve her aggressive state. Don&apos;t worry about the compensation, and I will do what I can for now. In the end, isn&#x2019;t the person the most important thing?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;...!&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&quot;That, I am really grateful... Please, I am begging you My Soo-young...&#x201D; The First Lady grabbed my hand while Director Oh was asking &#x2018;What are you planning?&#x2019; with his eyes. I just grinned at him before turning back to Soo-young. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;$^%#$^&amp;$%#&amp;&amp;.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;...Speak up.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">I whispered so that no one could hear and raised a hand to her face and shoulder. &#x2018;Eat. Until I say to stop.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style=""> The meal began. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style=""> &#x201C;#%@#%!!!!&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">A reaction appeared as soon as her desire started to be eaten. It was the breaking of the will that Yoon Chan-hee and I experienced. </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;$&#xC774;$&#xB7;&#xB7;&#xB7;&#xB7;&#xB7;&#xB7; This... #<a href="email-protection.html" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="527612">[email&#xA0;protected]</a>$...Stop....! $%^&amp;!! </span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Soo-young!&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Don&#x2019;t interrupt.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">I grabbed the shaking body. The woman&#x2019;s killing intent gradually faded until fear and horror appeared on her face. </span></p><p><span style="">That&apos;s it. I pulled away my hands. </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;...Ah...&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Soo-young swayed for a moment. She raised her head. There was no more killing intent in her eyes. There was just a strong feeling of fatigue. </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Mama...&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Soo-young!&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">I stepped away from the melodramatic scene. The cleanup inside the bomb shelter was over. There was only me, the mother and Director Oh. </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;...How surprising.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Let&#x2019;s see. Did you think I was just running my mouth?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">In fact, there was no chance of that. I was running my mouth, but there was no need to hurry if Soo-young was cured. The value of the reward presented to me would be much weaker than what it could be. </span></p><p><span style="">Of course. IF she was healed. </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I don&#x2019;t know how many hours it will take, but her madness will come back.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What?! You purposely...&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&quot;In the first place, curing her is impossible. Of course, if she goes crazy again then I can make her sane again. But it&#x2019;s just temporary.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">The sacred creature said it was possible if the root was destroyed, but then it wouldn&#x2019;t be much different from dying in the dungeon. Whether it was the will of the First Lady or the president, her parents didn&#x2019;t want anything to happen to their daughter. </span></p><p><span style="">That was a very good sign for me. Once the madness returns, I was the only one who could &#x2018;temporarily&#x2019; restore their daughter. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;You are a more thorough type than I thought...&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&quot;That doesn&#x2019;t sound like a compliment. </span></p><p><span style="">Even though I made a promise with Director Oh, there is no obligation for both parties to observe the promise. They might find that I was easier to eat, or Kim Tae-hyun might suddenly become stronger on the next floor. I could be abandoned at any time. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">But now things had changed. </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Please explain it to the First Lady as well. She will be quite heartbroken once she knows that there is no cure.&#x201D; Now the only way for the president&#x2019;s daughter to lead a good life was me. It was an advantage that only I could have. </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;...Why don&#x2019;t you explain it?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I don&#x2019;t want to lose my image. In addition, I should look at the condition of the patient a bit more... Oh, I also have a request that I would like you to listen to.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">I want to the bathroom and cleaned my body. The knife stab wound was almost better now. I opened the emergency first aid box, sterilized the wound and attached a bandage. &#xA0;I left the bathroom and looked around the kitchen, which was a mess. &#xA0;There were many food and drinks in the refrigerator for Soo-young. &#xA0;I took out a bottle of juice and approached Soo-young, who had removed the straitjacket. </span></p><p><span style="">Although it was still unsure if her condition had truly improved, her mother had taken off the straitjacket. </span></p><p><span style="">&quot;How are you feeling?&#x201D; Soo-young was the daughter of President Jin Su-cheol. Jin Soo-young looked at me. </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;....&#x201D; She received the juice without talking and turned her gaze to my face. I was well aware that my looks were good in a superficial society. </span></p><p><span style="">She asked me, &#x201C;How...? Did you?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I&#x2019;m sorry. It is like the basics of a business empire so I can&#x2019;t tell you.&quot; </span><span style="">I smiled and changed the topic. </span><span style="">&#x201C;Is it a unique talent? The talent that Soo-young got on the third day.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;...!&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">It was a combination of information received from Director Oh and my own speculations. Of course, I didn&#x2019;t explain my process of reasoning. </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes... That&apos;s right.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Call this a reward for me. If you don&#x2019;t mind, can you tell me exactly what that talent is?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;...&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Jin Soo-young seemed unwilling to answer. She saw me as a potential enemy so she didn&#x2019;t want to disclose the information. It was a unique talent that caused her to lose her temper and kill people. There wouldn&#x2019;t be a proper explanation for that. </span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;If the answer is difficult then don&#x2019;t say it.&#x2019; I could say that. However, I decided to go with a bold route. </span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I am Soo-young&#x2019;s doctor. I will continue to be next to you and help you live a normal life. I won&#x2019;t do anything harmful to Soo-young.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">To be precise, I wouldn&#x2019;t do anything &#x2018;for the moment.&#x2019; &#xA0;Depending on the variables in the future, I might eat and possess her talent. Therefore, I wanted to know the details. </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;...&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Jin Soo-young hesitated for a bit before reaching for the table next to the sofa. Paper and a pen were placed there. I accepted the paper that Jin Soo-young handed over. </span></p><p><span style="">[Unique Talent No. 044 Butcher: You are constantly filled with the desire to kill others. The more dignified and noble the blood on your hands, the greater the urge to spill more. The instinct for killing is not necessarily the most fundamental, but it is certainly the most essential instinct. It is the most recognized instinct.] </span></p><p><span style="">[When dealing with &#x2018;creatures&#x2019;, you will receive a real-time awareness of the best way to kill the enemy using all the means you possess.] </span></p><p><span style="">[When dealing with &#x2018;creatures&#x2019;, you will always get the &#x2018;enhanced&#x2019; status.] </span></p><p><span style="">[You won&#x2019;t become tired when dealing with &#x2018;creatures&#x2019;.] </span></p><p><span style="">I read it then looked at Jin Soo-young&#x2019;s face. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">She explained, &#x201C;From the moment I got it... I couldn&#x2019;t control myself. So...&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;...&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">It was something to think about. This woman... </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hey.&#x201D; I turned my head. Director Oh had a grim expression on his face. He handed his phone to me. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Your request. To bring someone... I sent Kim Tae-hyun. I was sure he would do his best to bring them here safely.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Then?&quot; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;...Take it and see.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">I took the phone. The caller ID on the screen showed Kim Tae-hyun&#x2019;s name. Kim Tae-hyun&#x2019;s voice was heard before I brought the phone to my ear. However, he didn&#x2019;t seem to be speaking into the phone. His voice echoed like he was a little distance away. </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes. I received the call.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">[Why did you ask me to bring this person? What...?] </span></p><p><span style="">He sounded angry but concern and anxiety was behind it. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">[...Win...] </span></p><p><span style="">His voice became muffled. </span></p><p><span style="">[Oppa?] </span></p><p><span style="">&quot;It&apos;s me.&quot; Once I spoke, Yang Su-jin&#x2019;s voice became clear. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">[Oppa sent this pushover?!] </span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Pushover?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">[I already met him.] </span></p><p><span style="">I could hear Kim Tae-hyun groaning. </span></p><p><span style="">[On the 9th floor.]</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p>
