<p><span style="">Chapter 37 - Day 8, Special Gift</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p><p><span style=""> &#x201C;I-I&#x2019;m sorry I&#x2019;m late.&#x201D; She sat down in a hurry but Yoon Ji-hee&#x2019;s face colour didn&#x2019;t seem so bad.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Your condition looks good.&#x201D; I said as I ate the chicken ribs on the metal plate. Ah. Of course, I had to eat first. Maybe because she was 20 minutes late to the meeting, Yoon Ji-hee couldn&#x2019;t meet my gaze.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;What happened was my grandfather...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Eat first.&#x201D; I pointed to the metal plate. &quot;Let&#x2019;s finish the meal before talking.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Yes.&#x201D; Like a young child being instructed by their parents, Yoon Ji-hee focused on eating straight away. She glanced at me occasionally, but didn&#x2019;t speak until I had filled my stomach.</span></p><p><span style="">Once the plates were empty&#x2026; &#x201C;Yes. You mentioned it before. Ji-hee&#x2019;s grandfather summoned everyone.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Yoon Ji-hee nodded. As soon as he woke up in the morning, Chairman Yoon Sang-gyu summoned all his grandchildren. Two of the five people gathered there&#x2026; Yoon Sang-ah and Yoon Sang-min had expressions like they didn&#x2019;t know the situation.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Your grandfather. What was his reaction?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;There was a lot. He was very surprised. Grandfather was so shocked, something I&#x2019;ve never seen before. He seemed a little angry and...&#x201D; Of course, Yoon Ji-hee didn&#x2019;t say that she killed them on the seventh floor. &quot;The first thing he did was look at me.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;He thought Ji-hee would be the first one eliminated.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes... Not just me, but he asked everyone to give a brief explanation of what happened on the seventh floor.&#x201D; Yoon Sang-min and Yoon Sang-ah died while Yoon Ji-hee survived. For the people who couldn&#x2019;t believe it, Yoon Ji-hee briefly explained the core of what had happened: she learned the language and took advantage of that to control the golems.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Did he praise you?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;... No. He was more focused on the fact that two people had been eliminated rather than...&#x201D; Yoon Ji-hee had a grouchy expression on her face. She had probably been expecting a little bit of praise. She was ignored by her family, but she thought they would acknowledge her survival.</span></p><p><span style="">Although the failure of two grandchildren was tragic, it seemed like he still had no hope towards Yoon Ji-hee. It was just good luck that the knowledge she learned fit perfectly with the task. He didn&#x2019;t think anything else. For me, it was a very good sign.</span></p><p><span style="">I wiped my hands and mouth with a napkin. Yoon Ji-hee raised her head. &quot;People rely on their original impressions. It isn&#x2019;t easy to change a negative evaluation. That bias is scary.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;...&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">I reached my hand over the table. My palm touched the back of Yoon Ji-hee&#x2019;s hand, but there was nothing sexual about it.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;But I know. I was the one who saw the most benefits from what Ji-hee did. Frankly, my first impression of Ji-hee is completely different my impression of you now. I won&#x2019;t protect&#xA0;Ji-hee. Ji-hee is a partner who maintains your own share, and you proved it perfectly on that floor.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;...&#x201D; Yoon Ji-hee remained silent. She blushed and shook her head.</span></p><p><span style="">No. She thought I was giving her too much praise. She deserved it, but didn&#x2019;t seem to receive it from anyone other than me.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Now. Tell me honestly.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;... Huh?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Your grandfather&#x2019;s surprised expression. Honestly, it didn&#x2019;t feel that bad did it? That surprised expression when he saw Ji-hee&#x2019;s face.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;...&#x201D; Yoon Ji-hee&#x2019;s eyes moved upwards like she was recalling that scene. Then she nodded.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;How was it?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;A little...&#x201D; &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;He was surprised because he underestimated Ji-hee. Isn&#x2019;t that right?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;How about those two people? Yoon Sang-ah and Yoon Sang-min?&#x201D; Yoon Ji-hee suddenly burst out laughing.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I-I&apos;m sorry.&#x201D; Yoon Ji-hee covered her mouth with a hand. &#x201C;W-When they first entered the room... Grandfather asked Sang-min oppa about what happened last night. Sang-min oppa&#x2019;s confused face... He said he broke up with his girlfriend... Then Grandfather&#x2019;s expression...&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">The effect of the joke was decreased due to the stutter, but I laughed like it was really funny.&#xA0;</span><span style="">I didn&#x2019;t know what talent it was, but managing my expression seemed to be 10 times easier than before. </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;It&#x2019;s just the beginning. You&#x2019;ll have many surprises for your grandfather in the future. Well, was it just your grandfather?&#x201D; The family that ignored her. All the people around her. &#x201C;Try to remember. Like your grandfather&#x2019;s expression, don&#x2019;t you want to make other people have that expression?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;... Yes.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Then create it. I will help you. Just follow my orders like you did yesterday.&#x201D; Cooperate only with me. It was to prevent her from going &#x2018;astray&#x2019; in the future. All the rest, except for me, were marked as targets to be overcome. &#x201C;Ji-hee can do it. You have the skills and qualifications.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;... Yes.&#x201D; Yoon Ji-hee nodded with an impressed expression. I released Yoon Ji-hee&#x2019;s hand.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Now, there is this.&#x201D;&#xA0; Yoon Ji-hee spoke.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Huh?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Yoon Ji-hee pulled out a leather booklet. The 6th floor. It was the booklet with a handprint that the 2nd ranked boy dropped after dying. Despite my reading skills, I found it difficult to decipher, so I left it to Yoon Ji-hee. &quot;I read it all. Then letters rose up... Look.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">She handed me a note. I read the words that Yoon Ji-hee had written.</span></p><p><span style="">[Seal: Gale Book. A book item. Rank C.]</span></p><p><span style="">[A book containing the basics of how to handle wind. The scroll is imprinted with three magic spells, Wind Armour, Wind Bullet and &#x2018;Flap of Wings&#x2019;. Anybody can learn it by touching their palm to the page.]</span></p><p><span style="">[Magic power will be forcibly awakened for those without it.]</span></p><p><span style="">[Learning Difficulty Level: With a magic aptitude of 11 or less, a &#x2018;schizophrenia&#x2019; effect will always be applied. The penalty can be reduced according to the value of the &#x2018;willpower&#x2019; and &#x2018;mental resistance&#x2019; abilities.]</span></p><p><span style="">Indeed. It was now understandable to a certain extent why the 2nd ranked boy had acted like that. I had no &#x2018;magic aptitude&#x2019; in my stats. In other words, this meant 10 or less. None of the talents I gained so far had raised this figure. Unless I had a magic aptitude of 11 or more, I couldn&#x2019;t help but suffer schizophrenia.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I can&#x2019;t use this.&#x201D; It wouldn&#x2019;t hurt to have such a strong wind but it had no meaning if I became schizophrenic. My willpower was 15 points. My mental resistance increased with Pain Tolerance, but I hadn&#x2019;t received a message that it exceeded 10 points yet. The default value was quite low.</span></p><p><span style="">There was no need to take the risk. If I kept it, then one day I would be able to use it.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;What is it?&#x201D; I asked. </span></p><p><span style="">Yoon Ji-hee was smiling quietly as I passed the note back. She seemed to be a little shy, like she was expecting something. Was there something else that I could praise her for?</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Like this...&#x201D; Like a traditional choreographer, Yoon Ji-hee slowly moved her hands. At that moment...</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Eh? Is the door open?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Where is this wind blowing from?&#x201D; In the restaurant with a closed door, a cool wind was blowing. I looked at Yoon Ji-hee with amazement.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Did you learn it?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes, that... This is &#x2018;Flap of Wings.&#x2019; I can arbitrarily adjust the wind intensity or range.&#x201D; No, wasn&#x2019;t there a penalty?</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Magic aptitude, I&#x2019;ve had it for a while... I didn&#x2019;t know until the sixth floor... I thought it was somewhat useless...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;How much?&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;13 points.&quot; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Please compliment me.&#x2019; Yoon Ji-hee smiled with such an expression. It was because I was so surprised that I stiffened for a moment.</span></p><p><span style="">&amp;</span></p><p><span style="">[How come you only answer a phone call?]</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Should I have been replying?&#x201D; As I spoke in a firm tone, Yang Su-jin was speechless for a moment. I had no intention of giving her the cold shoulder. Just...</span></p><p><span style="">Yang Su-jin: </span><i><span style="">Oppa.</span></i> <i><span style="">What are you doing?</span></i></p><p><span style="">Yang Su-jin: </span><i><span style="">I&#x2019;m now in school &#x314B;&#x314B; &#x3160;&#x3160;&#x3160;&#x3160;&#xA0;</span></i></p><p><span style="">Yang Su-jin: </span><i><span style="">Oppa.</span></i></p><p><span style="">Yang Su-jin: </span><i><span style="">Oh.</span></i></p><p><span style="">Yang Su-jin: </span><i><span style="">Pa!</span></i></p><p><span style="">Yang Su-jin: </span><i><span style="">Pa!!</span></i></p><p><span style="">She bombarded me with Kakao talk messages every 30 minutes. (Kakao= Korean messaging app).</span></p><p><span style="">There was a limit to replying to each one. &#x201C;Did you have nothing to do?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">[No, well... Call me if you don&#x2019;t have anything to do. Well...]</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I am exercising.&#x201D; I replied bluntly. I was at a closed sports park in the evening. I had sneaked over the fence.</span></p><p><span style="">I hadn&#x2019;t been able to confirm my physical specs in detail on the seventh floor. For example, how fast could I run at a certain speed? I checked the endurance of my body by seeing if it could withstand a barrage of Ravenous Wolf Fist. So far, I hadn&#x2019;t become Superman.</span></p><p><span style="">I was able to reach the top of the basketball goal with a high jump. The car navigator application that I downloaded from the app store told me that I ran 58km, the distance of the park, in an hour. After the run, I did 20 minutes of shadow boxing. Finally, I sat down to rest, but I had recovered within three minutes.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;If you don&#x2019;t have anything to report, then I&#x2019;m going to sleep. Today there is no staircase, so I will rest well.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">[No, I have something to report!]</span></p><p><span style="">I didn&#x2019;t think it was very important.</span></p><p><span style="">[I met a crazy woman.]</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">[I was walking on the street when she spoke to me. She just suddenly asked if I went into the dungeon. She asked me that!]</span></p><p><span style="">I focused back on my cell phone. &#x201C;Did you do anything that would make her say that?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">[I didn&#x2019;t do anything. I was just on the way home from karaoke with my friends. She suddenly spoke to me in the middle of downtown.]</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;So, what did you do?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">[That... In fact, I should&#x2019;ve followed her but she was gone. I&#x2019;m going home now on the subway and bus.]</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Where?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">20 minutes later, I met up with Yang Su-jin. It was a street without any people. I couldn&#x2019;t sense anyone tailing her.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;This is a little exciting. It is the first time a man has walked me home.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Instead of responding, I asked her. &quot;What did that woman do?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Don&#x2019;t you want to know what she said instead?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;What did she say?&quot; Yang Su-jin&#x2019;s expression became strange at this question.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I said she was a crazy woman... She laughed and wanted to cooperate with me. If we combined our strengths, then we could break through the dungeon without dying. She said this.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Bullsh*t.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;It is bullsh*t. I felt goosebumps and refused as soon as I heard it.&#x201D; How did she know that Yang Su-jin entered the dungeon? Did she have the ability to detect a person? Maybe it wasn&#x2019;t the ability to pick out who entered the dungeon, but rather, it identified the abilities of a person? &#x201C;Then... It became really weird.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Hrmm?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Nobody needs to be hurt. I tried to stop her talking such nonsense but... It was only for a moment, but it didn&#x2019;t sound like bullsh*t.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Did you get hypnotized?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Eh?! I really don&#x2019;t know! Then what if I did?&#x201D; I just threw out the word but Yang Su-jin had an anxious expression on her face. &quot;I don&#x2019;t know if she looks bad, but it was strange. Her voice was very good. It was like... Like a mother, I felt that sense of peace? Honestly, if it wasn&#x2019;t for Oppa then I might have followed her.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Yang Su-jin shook as she spoke.&#xA0;</span><span style="">&quot;If it was hypnosis then a little jolt will solve it right? Can you go into an alley and beat me up?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;... Don&#x2019;t say such strange things.&#x201D; If somebody heard then it would be a big deal. Once I saw Yang Su-jin&#x2019;s response, a possibility other than hypnosis emerged. </span></p><p><span style="">&quot;She might have developed a persuasion related talent.&#x201D; I had changed people&#x2019;s reactions and even intimidated Lee Sang-yoon today, despite having no evidence.</span></p><p><span style="">I leaned more towards physical abilities, but what if I was the opposite? It wouldn&#x2019;t be impossible to manipulate people with words. &#x201C;But even so, it should feel quite bad.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes... It really was weird. If they survive by joining forces, they might be able to turn this reality into a better place... It would be like Jesus.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;... Certainly.&#x201D; It seemed stupid at first glance. In a world like this, people were more likely to live in a harsh manner. But that woman caused even Yang Su-jin, who wasn&#x2019;t a fool, to shake for a moment. She had enough eloquence to make a person change their minds. Or maybe she spoke sincerely... &#xA0;If so, she was a rare human being these days.</span></p><p><span style="">After leaving Yang Su-jin, I returned home and showered. Speaking of which, it had been seven days since I lay in my bed. While falling into the comfortable drowsiness, I felt a slight unrest. Was it due to the woman that Yang Su-jin met?</span></p><p><span style="">A woman with a great sense of purpose, who was gathering people to cooperate and change this reality. If she really existed, she was several times more dangerous than a liar who was a hypocrite. Either way, she was completely incompatible with me.</span></p><p><span style="">At least, inside the dungeon.</span></p><p><span style="">Well... It was unlikely she existed. There was &#x2018;no such thing&#x2019; in reality.</span></p><p><span style="">I fell asleep.</span></p><p><span style="">It was a very sweet sleep.</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p>
