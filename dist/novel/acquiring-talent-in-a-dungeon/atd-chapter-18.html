<p><span style="">Chapter 18 - Day 5, 5th Floor Social Standing</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p><p><span style="">According to my estimate, there were 30 people left, which was more than I thought there would be.</span></p><p><span style="">The remaining people weren&#x2019;t communicating with each other. They knew those left at the end would have to form a team so they just watched each other&#x2019;s faces. It seemed like they wanted to stay until the end.</span></p><p><i><span style="">Tak.</span></i></p><p><span style="">There was a loud sound as I closed the book and 30 pairs of eyes focused on me. &quot;Please hand me the leftovers from our meal and water.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Yes!&quot; I ate the remaining food and drank water. I had already eaten but some time had passed and I was quite hungry, so why shouldn&#x2019;t I eat the remaining food? Of course, I finished it quickly and turned my attention back to the book.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Again? I&#x2019;m bored because you&#x2019;re only looking at books.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Read this.&#x201D; I threw the mathematics book at Yang Su-jin and concentrated.</span></p><p><span style="">[Reading Comprehension. Lv 3. 44/400]</span></p><p><span style="">[Language Acquisition Lv 2. 187/200]</span></p><p><span style="">[English (Reading, Writing) &#xA0;Lv 3. 13/400]</span></p><p><span style="">Some time passed and I saw a shadow in front of me. I looked up to see a man standing over me. His angular face and thick eyebrows gave off a tough impression. When he opened his mouth, a thick and calm voice came out. &#x201C;I&#x2019;d like to go with you.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Your name?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Kwak Yu-han.&#x201D; I looked at the list on the wall. Kwak Yu-han was in 7th place. &quot;If you let me go with you...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Wait there.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Do you want to go with me? Then wait until everyone is gathered.&#x201D; Kwak Yu-han&#x2019;s eyes widened like he was surprised and he nodded. He sat down against the wall and leaned on it.</span></p><p><span style="">That was the beginning. After seeing me accept Kwak Yu-han so easily, the rest of the people started to gather around. &#x201C;I-I will go as well.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;My name is...&#x201D; I had put on a wicked act. In order to get what I wanted, I was a powerful person who did terrible things without changing my expression. </span></p><p><span style="">So what were their motives for going with someone like this? Kill me or &#x2018;eat me&#x2019;? It was an easy way of thinking, but would all thirty something people think the same thing? I needed to think more realistically.</span></p><p><span style="">I looked at the crowd of people gathered and raised my index finger before I made a &#x2018;shh&#x2019; gesture and everyone fell silent. This compliant response was my evidence. In general, there weren&#x2019;t many who would choose to fight someone stronger than them. They would rather choose to go under that strong person.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Excuse me, you there in the front. Your name?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Kim Jong-gyu. I...&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Rank.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;125...&#x201D; I raised my hand to stop him. &#x201C;Huh?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I would appreciate it if you get out of the way so I can see the others.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Kim Jong-gyu&#x2019;s complexion changed. &quot;Nope. Can you just listen to me for a minute? Just please take me. If you let me accompany you then I will do whatever Kim Hee-chul ssi tells me to do. So...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">He was a fairly educated person so his words flowed smoothly, but it didn&#x2019;t matter. &quot;Excuse me, Ajusshi.&#x201D; I interrupted Kim Jong-gyu and pointed a finger. His head looked in the direction of my finger like a dog. He saw the people silently watching the conversation.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;See them? Do you think that any of these people will be less hardworking than Ajusshi?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;...&#x201D; Kim Jong-gyu&#x2019;s expression was embarrassed. It was a smart idea but he had too many competitors. A person with the strength of two people. Two people who moved as one. I had wondered if it was easy to break through this dungeon, but I hadn&#x2019;t been able to find a good answer.</span></p><p><span style="">But that was before killing someone in this dungeon. I would gain the &#x2018;talent&#x2019; they had in the dungeon. It wasn&#x2019;t 1+1, but rather 1+0.1~0.2. I hadn&#x2019;t suddenly become a genius just because the loser was killed. </span></p><p><span style="">Moreover, considering that techniques weren&#x2019;t passed down if someone was killed, the best way to break through this dungeon was to work as a team. Of course, it wasn&#x2019;t that easy. Trust didn&#x2019;t suddenly sprout from the ground.</span></p><p><span style="">Even if two people who were similar in skill were able to hold hands and negotiate, it was hard to trust one another unless they believed in each other thoroughly. But what if they weren&#x2019;t equal? What if there was a clear hierarchical relationship?</span></p><p><span style="">Obedience. Rather, the one on the bottom could be comfortable as they obeyed the one above. By giving up that initiative, I had to be confident that the person wouldn&#x2019;t betray me.</span></p><p><span style="">The second successful candidate was a boy around 20 years ago. He was somewhat defiant and handsome. Compared to the well-grown body, his face was still immature. &#x201C;Kim Ha-jong. 19th place.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Go wait at the wall.&#x201D; Ever since Kim Jong-gyu&#x2019;s exclusion, half the people had turned away silently. Perhaps they were ranked lower than Kim Jong-gyu. There wasn&#x2019;t the least bit of value in bringing them with me.</span></p><p><span style="">The third and fourth people that I picked were a set. There was one girl who looked around Yang Su-jin&#x2019;s age. The other person was a boy who seemed to be one or two years older. &#x201C;Siblings?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes. My brother is Lee Sang-hoon. I am Lee Min-ju.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Compared to the older sister&#x2019;s attitude, the younger brother seemed to be in a poorer condition. There was no eye contact and his shoulders were slumped. &quot;My brother is ranked 185th but I am 15th.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Are you a set deal?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;My brother&#x2019;s share... No, I am confident that he can do it.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;This pair would be useless.&#x201D; Yang Su-jin spoke in a mocking voice towards Lee Min-ju. She was looking at Lee Min-ju with dissatisfaction. Lee Min-ju was glaring back.</span></p><p><i><span style="">Clack!</span></i></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ah!&#x201D; I hit Yang Su-jin in the back of the head and nodded to Lee Min-ju.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Go to the wall and wait.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Thank you!&quot; The sister pulled her little brother away with saying a word.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;A-Are you really going to take them?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Are you jealous of a younger woman?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;... It isn&#x2019;t like that. I just don&#x2019;t like her expression. She is trying to create an image that she works hard.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;She is the 15th ranked. What are you?&quot; Of course, I already knew Yang Su-jin was ranked 41st.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Still...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;You just have to follow my instructions. Clearly understand the line separating both of us. You don&#x2019;t seem like the type of make a mistake like this.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;...&#x201D; Now there was only one spot left. Among all the people, one woman walked out. I thought she would come out, and I had been watching her from the beginning.</span></p><p><span style="">3rd rank.</span></p><p><span style="">The second time I saw her, Yoo Su-jeong had a creepy smile on her face. I had seen her kill and take An Su-hyun&#x2019;s abilities two days ago. &quot;I thought you would be popular, but this is beyond what than I imagined. You even caught a cute schoolgirl.&#x201D; There was admiration mixed in, causing Yang Su-jin to feel &#xA0;uncomfortable. </span></p><p><span style="">In fact, I was quite uncomfortable as well. Yoo Su-jeong was wearing a grey dress that showed off her body and seemed to be intended to maximize her sex appeal.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Go back and wait.&#x201D; I interrupted before Yoo Su-jeong managed to completely speak.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Eh? Aren&#x2019;t you going to listen to my story?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;You are the 3rd ranked, so what do I need to hear?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Still...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I don&#x2019;t want to hear one more word.&#x201D; As soon as I finished speaking, I beckoned to the people leaning against the wall. I headed towards the nearby stage. Then I beckoned to Yoo Su-jeong.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;...Well, okay. It wouldn&#x2019;t be bad to&#xA0;let you follow me.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Yoo Su-jeong shook as she walked back towards me. </span></p><p><span style="">As she looked at me with discomfort, I grabbed Yang Su-jin&#x2019;s shoulder, lowered my voice and whispered, &quot;Walk with me.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes...? Yes.&quot; She slowed down as naturally as possible, without making it seem like she had deliberately slowed down. On the other hand, I repeated numbers one by one.It was my cell phone number.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Memorize it.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Contact me as soon as you leave.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;... Are you going to buy me a meal?&#x201D; What was she talking about? Obedience was good. There was the Leadership talent so I was sure that there were plenty of talents in this field. Finally, after climbing onto the stage, I looked at all the ones left out.</span></p><p><span style="">To be honest, a leader might prefer leading those with insufficient abilities. However, the more competent and ambitious a person was, the more they would expect an equal relationship. Yoo Su-jeong was separate from that.</span></p><p><span style="">[Is this group of seven okay?]</span></p><p><span style="">The stone statue asked me. Once again, I read the invisible expression. It was smiling like it knew everything.</span></p><p><span style=""> &#x201C;Yes.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">I answered despite the statue&#x2019;s ability to read my mind. I never thought I would be a leader. A person should know their capabilities. &#x2018;Not being able to do it now&#x2019; was different from &#x2018;not being able to do it.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">Right now, I wasn&#x2019;t going to take care of those on the stage. I was better than them. I had enough talent to be ranked first and would receive new talents on the sixth floor. Yang Su-jin also had the means of distinguishing between potions and poisons.</span></p><p><span style="">On the next floor, I would kill five people. In reality, I would cooperate with Yang Su-jin and start the poisoning first. Subtracting one of the siblings, the actual number was four. It was fortunate that I could bring in someone slightly lacking due to his older sister.</span></p><p><span style="">Even if I had poison, it was a big risk to take down five people.</span></p><p><span style="">[Now, move on to the 6th floor!]</span></p><p><span style="">[5th floor cleared.]</span></p><p><span style="">&#x25CE;</span></p><p><span style="">My eyes opened. &quot;...Well.&#x201D; Today, I had a test. I brushed my teeth, went to the bathroom and organized my schedule in my head.</span></p><p><span style="">I would go to school early in the morning and study with a friend until lunch. The test was at 2 p.m. And in the evening... I would meet with Yang Su-jin to make a plan.</span></p><p><span style="">However, there still wasn&#x2019;t a phone call from Yang Su-jin. There was also no rice in the rice cooker. I had forgotten to buy rice yesterday. Should I eat at the convenience store?</span></p><p><span style="">I put on sweatpants and left the front door. The elevator was just coming down from the fifth floor. My place was on the fourth floor. Ah, I missed it...</span></p><p><i><span style="">Dding.</span></i></p><p><span style="">The elevator stopped. Why was it was stopping at the fourth floor? There was no one I knew upstairs who would stop here except for the caretaker. I expected to see An Su-hyun&#x2019;s face when the door opened. However, it was the face of a woman.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Ah, you were coming out.&#x201D; Yoo Su-jeong greeted him with a sincere expression.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;The day before yesterday. The manager told me. Hee-chul ssi lives in No. 405.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">I formed fists inside my pockets. I was conscious of the CCTVs in the corridor. My expression didn&#x2019;t change. &quot;I don&#x2019;t want to be stalked.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Is that so? Hehe. I&apos;m sorry if you are offended. But it couldn&#x2019;t be helped. I definitely needed to see you.&#x201D; I clicked my tongue and walked towards the elevator. The next moment, Yoo Su-jeong fell to her knees.</span></p><p><span style="">I pulled my fists out of my pockets and&#x2026; Yoo Su-jeong was begging on her knees. &quot;What are you doing? This...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Well. Isn&#x2019;t this the basic posture when asking for a request?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">A request? </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Please don&#x2019;t kill me. Please.&#x201D; Yoo Su-jeong smiled brightly as she begged.</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p>
