<p><span style="">Chapter 56 - &#xA0;Day 13, 10th Floor Demon</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p><p><span style="">Jin Soo-young didn&#x2019;t immediately accept after receiving the request, but she didn&#x2019;t refuse. </span></p><p><i><span style="">Seuk.</span></i></p><p><span style="">Instead, she walked towards the door of the room and pushed the steel door with her hand. </span></p><p><i><span style="">Tang.</span></i></p><p><span style="">Once it closed, she locked it and headed to a corner of the room. I soon realized that it was a blind spot in the CCTV system. A lighter and cigarette emerged from a cabinet attached to the wall. </span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Your parents gave you cigarettes?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;...There are occasionally smokers among the people I killed.&#x201D; &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">Of course, she had to act crazy so she couldn&#x2019;t be seen smoking peacefully. She took the cigarettes from the dead bodies. &#x201C;Hoo.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">As expected for a dungeon exploration, her lung capacity meant that half the cigarette was gone with one suck. There was no tragic image in the appearance of Jin Soo-young who closed her eyes and belched out smoke. I had no prejudices towards smoking women. Yang Su-jin also smoked in front of me. </span></p><p><span style="">But Jin Soo-young was quite different. A decadent aura emerged as soon as she shook off her acting. </span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Will you serve as my bodyguard while sucking out the honey?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Jin Soo-young was a shield. While she survived, I could almost completely shake off any legal or physical problems in the real world. She asked, &#x201C;Aren&#x2019;t you being too greedy? Do you really think you can afford me?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Jin Soo-young gazed at me with a provocative look and smiled. &#xA0;&quot;I admit that you are good for recognizing that I&#x2019;m not suffering, but can you really handle me? I&#x2019;m telling you ahead of time, but as soon as my act reappears, I am going to kill you. As soon as we enter the dungeon, I will go after you and try to kill you.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;...&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Don&#x2019;t take on something that you can&#x2019;t handle. You should just accept the reward for treating me just now. But thanks to that, it made my act more natural.&#x201D; </span></p><p><i><span style="">Chobeok.</span></i></p><p><span style="">I took a few steps. Then I extended my palms towards Jin Soo-young. </span></p><p><span style="">&quot;What?&quot; </span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Doesn&#x2019;t this apply to me as well? The CCTV blind spot?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Why...&#x201D; </span></p><p><i><span style="">Pahat!</span></i></p><p><span style="">A light emerged from my palms and struck right next to Jin Soo-young&#x2019;s head. This was a bomb shelter. Although the metal layer underneath couldn&#x2019;t be pierced, the concrete surface behind Jin Soo-young completed caved in. Was it because she already had the thought? Jin Soo-young didn&#x2019;t even react. </span></p><p><i><span style="">Tok.</span></i></p><p><span style="">The cigarette butt she was biting fell to the ground. </span></p><p><span style="">I smiled and said, &quot;It won&#x2019;t be that easy to catch me with your bare hands. Humans are still creatures who use tools. Isn&apos;t that right?&quot; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;...You can&apos;t kill me.&#x201D; Jin Soo-young muttered. </span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I can&#x2019;t. However, the second best thing is burning your limbs so that you are quiet for the rest of the day. Of course, it will be a different story if you cooperate.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;...&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&quot;There is a way to communicate with every person.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">I immediately approached her. I picked up the cigarette butt and threw it in the bin. </span></p><p><span style="">&quot;A threatened dog will bite. You can&#x2019;t get rid of it.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">[The merger request has been accepted.] </span></p><p><span style="">[The queen of &#x2018;Vermouth&#x2019; has been annexed by the monarch of &#x2018;Talia.&#x2019;] </span></p><p><span style="">[&#x2018;City-Vermouth&#x2019; has been integrated in Talia&#x2019;s territory.] </span></p><p><span style="">[The location coordinates have become synchronized with the monarch.] </span></p><p><span style="">The location coordinates were synchronized. It meant she wasn&#x2019;t moved to the city. </span><span style="">That seemed to be the case. </span></p><p><span style="">If she could attack, then attack. However, there was no attack as I walked to the closed door. &#xA0;</span></p><p><i><span style="">Ching.</span></i></p><p><span style="">The door was opened to reveal a confused Director Oh. Despite the door being closed, had the sound of the explosion leaked? </span></p><p><span style="">&quot;What&#x2019;s going on?&quot; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;It&#x2019;s not a big deal. There were some symptoms so I took care of it.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">I turned and looked at Jin Soo-young. &#xA0;Then I briefly winked. </span></p><p><span style="">Please take care. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">&amp; </span></p><p><span style="">The reconstruction was done quickly. The area where Yang Su-jin and Yoon Ji-hee were staying was supposed to be a laboratory. There were glass bottles filled with chemicals and simple experiments set up on the newly installed tables.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Wah... This sort of thing... I never thought I would see it. No, frankly, I thought about it, but it was unrealistic. Even Ji-hee unni won&#x2019;t be able to get these type of things...&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">But it actually happened. Some of the chemicals and experiments could be brought into the dungeon by Yang Su-jin. She also had more drugs to combine, and could increase her talent experience. </span></p><p><span style="">&quot;If you need anything then tell me.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;...Aren&#x2019;t we strong now?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Then.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">This bomb shelter was an invincible space. It wasn&#x2019;t because of Yang Su-jin and Yoon Ji-hee, but because of the tough security to protect the VIP Jin Soo-young. In addition, even though points existed in the past, the points couldn&#x2019;t be used on these chemicals for fear of them being noticed by the private sector. Therefore, it felt like &#x2018;renting&#x2019; the chemicals. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">Of course, points weren&#x2019;t required either. Originally, I had planned on spending my points for all three people, but now it was on Jin Soo-young&#x2019;s book. </span></p><p><span style="">Once it neared midnight, Yang Su-jin told me before heading off into different rooms. &quot;There are surveillance cameras, but please still be careful. You don&#x2019;t know what might happen when a man and woman are in the same place.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&quot;You shouldn&#x2019;t be saying that to me.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">I laughed but Yang Su-jin just looked at me. Ah. Yang Su-jin looked at Yoon Ji-hee. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;...&#x201D; Although it wasn&#x2019;t as much as before, there was a dark shadow on her face. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">Su-jin cried out, &#x201C;T-Then have strength. Oppa! Fighting!&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;...&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Unni should do it too! Fighting!&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;...Please be careful.&#x201D; I said and started to leave.</span></p><p><span style="">Yoon Ji-hee spat out briefly just before I closed the steel door. </span><span style="">&#x201C;...Fighting.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">I waved my hand and headed for our room once the door closed. There was a bit of time left, so I headed to my private bedroom. I was carefully choosing the books I would carry into the dungeon. Then I heard the sound of footsteps heading towards me. </span></p><p><span style="">Jin Soo-young was standing on the threshold. She was in a bathrobe and water vapour was still rising from her skin. </span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Is there something you wanted?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Didn&#x2019;t you say it?&#x201D; She pulled the towel covering her head away, revealing still wet hair. </span><span style="">&quot;Everybody has a different approach at communication.&#x201D; &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">Like the towel covering her head, her bathrobe fell down. &quot;I thought about it before. What is the right approach?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">To be honest, it wasn&#x2019;t hard to resist her charm. I hadn&#x2019;t seen many naked bodies in my life, but I could see it through the media or the Internet rather than reality. The expression on her face also wasn&#x2019;t good enough to &#x2018;seduce&#x2019; me. The slightly narrowed eyes were looking this way confidently. </span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Let&apos;s do it.&quot; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;...&#x201D; It was nothing new but I was a little surprised at her honesty. </span></p><p><span style="">&quot;The dungeon will open soon.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&quot;There is still an hour. Isn&#x2019;t that enough time?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Do you think there will be a significant change in that hour?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Jin Soo-young shrugged. She didn&#x2019;t care that the action shook her upper body as she moved towards me. </span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Some things can happen in an hour.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">I made a calculation error. Jin Soo-young was far bolder than the sheltered girl I thought she was. </span></p><p><span style="">&quot;It is necessary to worry? Even one hour can allow us to move together more smoothly. Or...&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Her eyes narrowed further. She boldly stated. &#x201C;Are you scared? Do you think I will kill you while it is happening? Or are you afraid that something meaningful will happen in that hour?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">This was why I refused to have relationships. At the same time, there were two reasons for Jin Soo-young to try this. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">I closed my book. As I got up from the bed, Jin Soo-young sighed with ridicule and raised a hand to poke my chest. &quot;No courage...&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">My mouth covered Jin Soo-young&#x2019;s. </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;...!&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">A rough breath emerged as my tongue stimulated her mouth. She was at a loss. &#xA0;Her gazed dropped down to my mouth and she looked at me with embarrassment. I said, &quot;I won&#x2019;t deny what you are giving me.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">I didn&#x2019;t care if she really tried to kill me during it or if something changed. I wouldn&#x2019;t allow both situations. &#xA0;Then wasn&#x2019;t the conclusion obvious? Late at night. I was a man. I also have an overly healthy body. &#xA0;There was no reason to resist an opportunity like this. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">I wrapped my hands around Jin Soo-young&#x2019;s waist and hips to lift her and laid her on the bed. The smell of a familiar brand of body wash swept over me. &#xA0;As Jin Soo-young said, one hour was enough. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">...Was it enough? </span></p><p><span style="">&amp; </span></p><p><span style="">The 10th floor was an open space and the wind blowing was quite chilly. I had entered soon after I took a shower. I thought about wiping away the water. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">It wasn&#x2019;t a floor but a dirt ground. There were sand, stones and sparse plants scattered around. An outdoor area. I saw a light from far away. Mountain? Or maybe a tower. I couldn&#x2019;t guess the shape because the distance was quite far, but it was lit up and quite high. </span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Let&#x2019;s go over there.&#x201D; I looked behind me. </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;....&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hey.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;...Uh!&#x201D; Jin Soo-young jumped at my voice. </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Let&#x2019;s go over there. Or run away like you said before.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;...U-Understood.&quot; </span></p><p><span style="">Jin Soo-young moved next to me as I walked. She touched her head. She had laid down before the water dried properly, so her hair was a mess. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;There was plenty of time to wash. Isn&#x2019;t that uncomfortable?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;...I don&#x2019;t know.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Well, you are free to do what you like.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">As I got closer to where the light was coming from, the shape started to become slightly clearer. It was a mountain. A castle that resembled the castled of old Europe was surrounded by towering icicle shaped mountains. The lights were distributed evenly between the mountains and the plains. </span><span style="">It meant people were residing there. The scale indicated that there were more people than the Tellans living in the forest. </span></p><p><span style="">&quot;If you know they are Tellans, don&#x2019;t attack first as I want to talk to them.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;...&#x201D; Jin Soo-young didn&#x2019;t agree or deny my words but I didn&#x2019;t care. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">She suddenly asked me, &#x201C;...Aren&#x2019;t you acting really casual?&#x201D;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&quot;You really do feel nothing. Maybe I am just conscious but...&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">I tapped a finger. &#xA0;</span></p><p><i><span style="">Clack!</span></i></p><p><span style="">Jin Soo-young&#x2019;s eyes widened at the sound. &#x201C;What...?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Think about where we are now.&#x201D; I gazed at Jin Soo-young with narrowed eyes. </span><span style="">&quot;It is you who offered yourself. You were the one who made the calculations, so don&#x2019;t be so annoying about it.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&quot;A-Am I annoying?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Then what? Unfortunately, but I think that was the last chance for you to get me in your bed.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Killing intent emerged from Jin Soo-young. Her face was flushed. </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;You... Even if you want to, I won&#x2019;t...&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&quot;This is getting annoying.&#x201D; I waved my hands and started walking again. </span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Strike my back. Or follow. Just pick one of them.&#x201D; Whether Jin Soo-young followed me or not, I headed towards the nearest light. </span></p><p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">I smell something.</span></i></p><p><span style="">As I thought, the sacred creature was a good detector. As soon as I entered the 10th floor, the sacred creature told me that it could smell desires. </span></p><p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">Several tasteless things...</span></i> <i><span style="">And there is one that is less tasteless.</span></i></p><p><span style="">It meant there was one strong person and several weak ones. If they were Tellans, then they weren&#x2019;t opponents that could harm me. I moved in the direction that the sacred creature pointed as quickly as possible. &#xA0;If the Tellans lived in the castle then I would reach out and offer them citizenship. </span></p><p><span style="">While running quickly, one man entered my sight. &#xA0;It was an explorer. His eyes were wide open. Blood was pouring from the explorer&#x2019;s mouth. A spear was protruding through his chest. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;What?&quot; </span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Another person!&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Tellans were behind him. I could tell that there were more than 20 of them just by looking. Unlike those seen in the forest, these Tellans were armed with a spear and metal armor. I didn&#x2019;t hesitate to offer them citizenship. Words simultaneously appeared in front of their eyes. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">But... &#x201C;Demon!&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Kill! Be sure to kill it!&#x201D; &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">Their reaction was different than I anticipated.</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p>
