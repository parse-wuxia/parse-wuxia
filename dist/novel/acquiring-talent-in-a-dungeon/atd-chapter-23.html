<p><span style="">Chapter 23 - &#xA0;Day 6, 6th Floor Eating</span></p><p><strong>TL Note:&#xA0;</strong>I know that some people are having trouble remembering the names. Fortunately, my editor has been making a glossary and I&apos;ve decided to share it with you. <a href="www.wuxiaworld.com">Check it out here.</a></p><p>There is also a glossary of common Korean terms such as hyung etc. that can be accessed from the table of contents.</p><p></p><hr><p></p><p><span style="">[Essence - Rock Lizardman.]</span></p><p><span style="">[As long as the owner &#x2018;grips&#x2019; it, muscle strength +2.]</span></p><p><span style="">[Increases HP regeneration by 100%. The rate of restoration will dramatically increased against injuries such as burns. There is a slight decrease in the base metabolic rate of the body. Grants immunity against various heat sensing abilities. Body&#x2019;s resistance to cold is decreased. 50% more vulnerable to ice attacks.]</span></p><p><span style="">The first thing I felt was a change in temperature. &#x201C;Huu.&#x201D; Even though it wasn&#x2019;t that cold, I felt like it was almost as cold as the beginning of winter. From now on, I couldn&#x2019;t wear cheap padding or I would die.</span></p><p><span style="">The lizardman dropped 15 silver coins and a item that was similar to a lighter called the &#x2018;Sun Stone,&#x2019; but that was all. There were also coins scattered around Lee Chang-ju&#x2019;s remains. The book that fell to the ground... Ah, it wasn&#x2019;t a book?</span></p><p><span style="">It looked like a thick book that would have hundreds of pages, but there were actually only a few pages. It was an eight page mini-booklet made of heavy leather pieces instead of paper. &#xA0;There were unknown letters carved on the outside. As he flipped through the booklet, the same type of letters filled the pages. </span></p><p>On the other side of the page was a man&#x2019;s palm-shaped groove etched into the thick leather. Should I place my palm there? ... No. I would hold off for now. It was too risky to use it right now when I didn&#x2019;t know its purpose.</p><p><span style="">I got up. I was sure that the other people would have heard the shouting just now. But they didn&#x2019;t come up. I thought about it and descended the stairs. The next moment, I felt my heart sinking in my chest.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;You came here to die.&#x201D; Yoo Su-jeong said with a wide smile. She was standing approximately 30 stairs away. Yang Su-jin groaned as a dagger was held to her neck.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;... What is this?&#x201D; I spoke in a calm manner while calculating how long I had until this peak collapsed. It would happen in less than five minutes. It wasn&#x2019;t hard to grasp the circumstances.</span></p><p><span style="">Kim Ha-jong was holding a blade to Yang Su-jin&#x2019;s neck. Kwak Yu-han was overpowering the three lower ranked members, including Yoon Ji-hee.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Did you kill the two above?&#x201D; The two bodies collapsed on the peak were high ranking. Their deaths certainly weren&#x2019;t due to the lizardmen.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;It couldn&apos;t be helped. Those people, they secretly tried to descend when there was a gap. I killed one while Kwak Yu-han here murdered the other.&#x201D; Kwak Yu-han had a sour expression on his face. I could roughly imagine her trick. She must have put a knife to the back of one person while yelling at Kwak Yu-han to kill the other.</span></p><p><span style="">Although he was confused, he swung his sword because Yoo Su-jeong was higher ranked. Kwak Yu-han avoided my eyes and muttered an excuse. &quot;I thought you were dead. What could I do...?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;That&apos;s right. Everybody&#x2019;s mental state is a little shaken. So this girl made a stupid choice.&#x201D; Yoo Su-jeong lifted a bottle. It was the poison bottle that I had shared with Yang Su-jin. &quot;She sneaked to the back and tried to splash us with this. It is a shame that I knew what would happen ahead of time. It was lucky.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Yang Su-jin&#x2019;s bottle was like the one I had used on the leader of the other group. &quot;Just a little while ago, I explained it. You colluded with this girl to kill us and I was threatened so I had no choice.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;...&#x201D; Kwak Yu-han and Kim Ha-jong made strange expressions. They understood Yoo Su-jeong. Even if it fit to a certain degree, the two people didn&#x2019;t believe 100% of her words. But the important thing was the flow. In the short time I was &#x2018;dead,&#x2019; they had already joined Yoo Su-jeong&#x2019;s side.</span></p><p><span style="">Anyway, it was just a temporary team. There was no need to bother with words. Kwak Yu-han and Kim Ha-jong&#x2019;s posture showed that they were aiming this way. &quot;You better not come down. If you do, all three of us will fight to the death.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Yoo Su-jeong pushed Yoon Ji-hee forward. She was the &#x2018;most rubbish&#x2019; so she was used as bait. &quot;Let&apos;s win together. I will give this girl to Hee-chul and you can go down the other stairs. Okay?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Instead of answering, I raised an index finger. Then I pointed it at Kim Ha-jong. &#x201C;... Is it decided that you will kill Yang Su-jin?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;... Yes.&#x201D; Kwak Yu-han and Yoo Su-jeong had both already killed one person. So this would somewhat maintain the balance between the three of them.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Then what are you waiting for?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Wha...t?&quot; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;If you are going to eat her talent then just cut her neck right there. Why, do you feel sorry because you saw that I survived?&#x201D; I spoke without thinking and it seemed correct to some extent. </span></p><p><span style="">Yoo Su-jeong glared at Kim Ha-jong. &#x201C;Kill her. Now.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;No...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Cut her! Aren&#x2019;t you going to eat? Or do you want me to eat her instead?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Cut!&quot; Kim Ha-jong gritted his teeth and moved his blade.</span></p><p><i><span style="">Seokeok.</span></i></p><p><span style="">It was a smooth slice and Yang Su-jin&#x2019;s head rolled down the stairs. As everyone&#x2019;s gaze followed her head, I jumped down the stairs.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;...!&#x201D; I aimed for Kim Ha-jong who was standing at the front. I grabbed his head and kneed him in the face with all my weight behind it. </span><span style="">Quite tasty. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">As something broke, </span></p><p><span style="">[All the talents and experience of the loser will belong to the winner.]</span></p><p><span style="">Letters rose up. They described the talents that I had absorbed from Kim Ha-jong, but there was no time to examine each one.</span></p><p><span style="">[Agility has exceeded the limit.]</span></p><p><span style="">[Agility: 12]</span></p><p><span style="">[Reflexes has exceeded the limit.]</span></p><p><span style="">[Reflexes: 14]</span></p><p><span style="">[Muscle strength has exceeded the limit.]</span></p><p><span style="">[Muscle strength: &#xA0;13]</span></p><p><span style="">[Health has exceeded the limit.]</span></p><p><span style="">[Health: 12]</span></p><p><span style="">I saw something flying at the edge of my vision and moved my head to avoid the bottle.</span></p><p><span style="">One of the bottom three screamed as the bottle hit them. I hoped it wasn&#x2019;t Yoon Ji-hee but I was too busy countering Yoo Su-jeong&#x2019;s daggers.</span></p><p><i><span style="">Rattle!</span></i></p><p><span style="">It was obviously a proper hit, but the feeling on the other end of my fist was quite subtle. &#xA0;It felt like Yoo Su-jeong&#x2019;s body had disappeared the moment I struck. Then someone embraced me from behind--Kwak Yu-han. He was really strong. He tried to lift me with his arms, but I put strength into my legs and resisted.</span></p><p><span style="">The next moment, something cold touched my abdomen.</span></p><p><span style="">[Current Balance: 192/256]</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hah...&#x201D; Yoo Su-jeong appeared in front of me with a wild smile. As she drew her dagger back to strike me in the stomach again, I spat in her face.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Kyak!&#x201D; Yoo Su-jeong flinched for a moment and gritted her teeth.</span></p><p><span style="">I was in a disadvantageous situation but in the end, Kwak Yu-han&#x2019;s strength was weaker than mine. By using all my strength, the arms around me were released.</span></p><p><span style="">I could finish him off, but I instead chose to move forward. I aimed towards Yoo Su-jeong who was wiping the spit off her face. She was capable of disappearing every time she was hit, but I thought it would be okay if I grabbed her.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ugh!&#x201D; In fact, this wasn&#x2019;t a skill from Ravenous Wolf Fist, but one I saw from wrestling. She became off balance and fell down along with me.</span></p><p><span style="">As I predicted, we fell exactly into the darkness. Before my dizzy vision could recover, I felt something moist and enormous wrap around my body.</span></p><p><span style="">I was swallowed by a leech. It was disgusting as I felt my whole body being dragged down. But it wasn&#x2019;t like I couldn&#x2019;t move my body. I took out the &#x2018;Sun Stone&#x2019; from my inventory. It was the stone that I got from the lizardman chieftain.</span></p><p><span style="">As described in the explanation, once pressure was applied, the stone would start to shine and emit the temperature of boiled water. Then the body of the leech became visible.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;...&#x201D; The first thing I saw was Yoo Su-jeong. In fact, I was a little worried because I couldn&#x2019;t hear her screaming. Maybe I was the only one swallowed, but that wasn&#x2019;t the case. Yoo Su-jeong had also been swallowed.</span></p><p><span style="">However, unlike me, she was being &#x2018;eaten.&#x2019; There were thousands of reddish black hairs surrounding and wrapped around her body. They penetrated her skin and entered her blood vessels. In a short amount of time, many hairs had entered and half her body was filled with black lines.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;...Ah...&#x201D; Yoo Su-jeong&#x2019;s wide eyes stared at me. She reached out like she was asking me to save her...</span></p><p><span style="">I responded to the call. I was safe. It had been a gamble, but one I thought I could try. After acquiring the immunity to &#x2018;heat detection methods&#x2019; from the lizardman essence, I thought that the leeches wouldn&#x2019;t recognize me as prey. But there was also a problem.</span></p><p><i><span style="">Kuuong.</span></i></p><p><span style="">The hairs around me were shaking and pushing me away from Yoo Su-jeong. It perceived me as unable to be eaten and was spitting me out. Of course, it was a good thing, but I should at least kill Yoo Su-jeong.</span></p><p><span style="">I grabbed the hairs with my hand and reached out towards Yoo Su-jeong, but I wasn&#x2019;t the only one moving. Yoo Su-jeong was being pulled deeper into the body.</span></p><p><span style="">I tried to somehow grab her neck but... In the end, Yoo Su-jeong disappeared from my sight. Instead, I could feel something cold in my hands after desperately fumbling for her body. A ring? I placed it in my inventory and pulled out something else.</span></p><p><span style="">Elmer&#x2019;s Dummy Destroyer. &#xA0;It was the only cutting instrument that I had. I cut the hairs with the blade while using Limiter Release. The hairs shook. Blood gushed from them as they were sliced apart.</span></p><p><span style="">I put my hand in that gap. The leech also felt pain so the gloves became more effective. I grasped something in my strong grip.</span></p><p><span style="">The hairs shook even more violently. As more blood poured out, I could feel that some hairs had penetrated my skin. Even if it couldn&#x2019;t suck my blood, the hairs perceived me as a threat and was attacking to remove me.</span></p><p><span style="">[Current Balance: 182/256]</span></p><p><span style="">[Current Balance: 169/256]</span></p><p><span style="">I tore the area in front of me open. Again and again&#x2026; Oh, I could taste it. I was almost suffocating due to all the blood coming from the torn hairs.</span></p><p><span style="">[Current Balance: 42/256]</span></p><p><span style="">As the disgusting blood entered my throat and nose, I desperately sought some air. Then a light shone in front of me.</span></p><p><span style="">[Essence - Shadow Leech.]</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p>
