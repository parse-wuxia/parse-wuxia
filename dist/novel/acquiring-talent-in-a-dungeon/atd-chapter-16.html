<p><span style="">Chapter 16 - Day 5, 5th Floor Hunger</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p><p><span style="">The next moment, the stone statue melted down.</span></p><p><span style="">[Please step away from me.]</span></p><p><span style="">Just like an ice cream in summer, the stone statue became a puddle &#xA0;and started to form a shape on the floor. It was a large plate that was one metre in height. The square plate filled 1/5th of the entire floor.</span></p><p><span style="">The stone statue, which was no much smaller than before, stood on top of the &#x2018;stage.&#x2019; &#xA0;Even so, the statue was still three metres tall.</span></p><p><span style="">[Originally, I wanted to do a tournament but there is a space constraint. Some people will also want to take a break. Those who are willing can come up at any time.]</span></p><p><span style="">As soon as the stone statue finished talking, dozens of people rushed towards the stage at once. There were the words &#x2018;no risk&#x2019; so they thought there was nothing to lose. The man who was first on the stage was the one who had neared the statue to question it. The people behind him were pushed out.</span></p><p><span style="">[Then, we will now begin.]</span></p><p><span style="">The very next moment, a number came up in front of me. The man on the stage asked with a confused expression.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Eh? What is this number three?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The statue answered everyone, not just the man.</span></p><p><span style="">[The number in front of you is the number of competitors you will have to defeat in order to get the talent on top of this stage. With a minimum of two people, the number has been assigned as fairly as possible considering your abilities and grades.]</span></p><p><span style="">Some people were sulking.</span></p><p><span style="">[Now, please come up on stage to challenge this person.]</span></p><p><span style="">A man immediately jumped onto the stage. He had a confident expression. It wasn&#x2019;t hard to guess the reason why.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Does he have a higher number?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style=""> &#x201C;Yes.&#x201D; It was like Yang Su-jin thought. The number was the same as a person&#x2019;s strength. The man on stage had unintentionally said &#x2018;three.&#x2019; Therefore, those with a higher number would feel confident.</span></p><p><span style="">[Even if your HP becomes zero, there is no out. Now. Start.]</span></p><p><span style="">The fight began. The man with the number three was pushed back. it was almost one-sided as his health fell to the bottom.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Eek!&#x201D; He swung a fist at the opponent&#x2019;s chest.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Heh!&#x201D; The opponent snorted like it was ludicrous... Then his complexion gradually changed and he spat up blood. There was a needle in his chest where the number three man had punched. Even though it wasn&#x2019;t deep, the opponent&#x2019;s HP decreased in a very short amount of time.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Poison?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Poison.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">[You have won the match. Who will be the next challenger? If a challenger doesn&#x2019;t appear in less than a minute, then he will get half the talent!]</span></p><p><span style="">I took my eyes off the stage and moved further into a back corner.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Aren&#x2019;t you watching?&#x201D; Yang Su-jin asked. There was no need to do so. The man only had a three. Rather, it was better to wait until the fervour had died down. Didn&#x2019;t they know that the poison and needles were equipment that they were throwing away when it was needed for future dungeon progression?</span></p><p><span style="">[You have lost.]</span></p><p><span style="">It wasn&#x2019;t surprising. The number three man had quickly received another challenger. He was showing signs of weariness. The opponent also knew his trick so he couldn&#x2019;t use it again.</span></p><p><span style="">[Now! Do we have a next challenger? If your number is &#x2018;two&#x2019; then you only have to win once!]</span></p><p><span style="">That was impossible. I pulled out the cloth bag. There were three thick books.</span></p><p><span style="">[Learn Programming Efficiently]</span></p><p><span style="">[The Basics of Mathematical Problem Solving]</span></p><p><span style="">[Advanced English: Reading] </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ah...&#x201D; Yang Su-jin&#x2019;s face was filled with shock. The talents you could get inside a dungeon were limited. But... what if I took books from different fields and read them? Would I be able to gain different abilities?</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Check the situation on stage. Tell me immediately if it seems like someone is going to get the talent.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ah, yes!&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">I started with &#x2018;Learn Programming Efficiently.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">[Talent has been acquired.]</span></p><p><span style="">[Talent - Reading Comprehension: &#xA0;The ability to read words faster. Understand the meaning of words will rise according to the level. Memory, thinking power and concentration have slightly increased.]</span></p><p><span style="">I continued reading.</span></p><p><span style="">[Reading Comprehension. Lv 1. 34/100]</span></p><p><span style="">I didn&#x2019;t receive programming. I had expected it, but it was worth trying. In the previous dungeon floors, I had tried wrestling with the air or swinging a fist at the wall. If I could raise the level of Punching then I would stay in the dungeon until I could no longer hold out.</span></p><p><span style="">However, it was useless. The level didn&#x2019;t increase because the experience rise was too slow. A condition was that the action needed to be valid.</span></p><p><span style="">In the case of programming, the talent didn&#x2019;t appear because I was merely skimming a theoretical book. Then... What about the second book? The Basics of Mathematical Problem Solving. It was the easiest mathematics book for beginners.</span></p><p><span style="">Mathematics. It was an area I wasn&#x2019;t particularly good at in middle or high school, but would there be some results since it was all in my head?</span></p><p><span style="">[Talent has been acquired.]</span></p><p><span style="">[Talent - Mathematics: &#xA0;The ability to clearly understand numbers, volume and space problems related to various objects and phenomena will rise according to the level. Thinking power, spatial perception and insight have slightly increased.]</span></p><p><span style="">Okay. Although it was slow, experience was definitely rising as I read the book. Now I was down to the last book. Advanced English: Reading. &#xA0;If I could get Mathematics then of course this should work.</span></p><p><span style="">The question was, what would the result show up as?</span></p><p><span style="">[Talent has been acquired.]</span></p><p><span style="">[Talent - Language Acquisition: &#xA0;The ability to learn languages other than your native language. Language acquisition will become faster and more accurate. Thinking power has slightly increased.]</span></p><p><span style="">[Talent has been acquired.]</span></p><p><span style="">[Talent - English (Reading, Writing): &#xA0;The ability to read and write English will rise according to the level. Thinking power, reading comprehension and planning have slightly increased.]</span></p><p><span style="">[English (Conversation) will be corrected according to the level.]</span></p><p><span style="">There was also this. I read the book without hesitation.</span></p><p><span style="">[Reading Comprehension Lv 2. 177/200]</span></p><p><span style="">[Language Acquisition Lv 2. 4/200]</span></p><p><span style="">[English (Reading, Writing) Lv 2. &#xA0;99/200]</span></p><p><span style="">[Concentration has exceeded its limit.]</span></p><p><span style="">[Concentration: 12]</span></p><p><span style="">Suddenly, a small water bottle was pushed in front of my face. It was Yang Su-jin;s doing. &quot;Your lips, they are dry.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">I became aware that I had a really sore throat. I opened the lid and asked, &#x201C;How much time has passed?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Well. Two or three hours?&#x201D; So quickly?</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;It is the first time I&#x2019;ve seen someone concentrate like this. Not even the best student in my class...&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">I ignored the burdensome gaze and looked towards the stage. &quot;Ah, that&apos;s right!&quot; There was a clap as Yang Su-jin started looking through her bag. I had given one of the two bags to Yang Su-jin so she would be able to bring what she needed in with her.</span></p><p><span style="">Her brain was young and quick so she might bring something that I would never think about. I was half filled with expectation. Yang Su-jin pulled out something that I never imagined from her bag.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Voila.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">There were two very big thermos. No, it wasn&#x2019;t a thermos&#x2026; They were heated lunch box tins. Although I accepted it unconsciously, the water bottle was also strange. As soon as Yang Su-jin opened the lid, the scent of hot steaming food wafted out.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;What is this smell?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Soy sauce stew...&#x2019; As the smell of food spread, gazes moved from the stage towards this area. They looked dumbfounded. I was also the same.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What? What is with that look? I brought this.&#x201D; Yang Su-jin clearly wasn&#x2019;t a normal schoolgirl in many ways.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Well. I would have brought a book like Oppa if I had thought about it. Honestly, I came up with this the moment I received the bag.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I se...e.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;It isn&#x2019;t instant food nor does it have MSG. Everything is homemade. Except the meatball! They are the three minute ones.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">I... I picked up the box. In fact, I was hungry. Two or three hours had passed, and it was a lot more time then I had spend on the 1-4th floors. As long as it filled me up...</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Eh?&#x201D; A sound emerged from my mouth.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;How is it? Delicious. Is it delicious?&#x201D; It wasn&#x2019;t because of the flavour. Letters had appeared the moment I took a bite.</span></p><p><span style="">[Hunger has recovered by two.</span></p><p><span style="">[Current hunger: &#xA0;58/100]</span></p><p><span style="">I looked at the water bottle. I had forgotten to drink it after opening the lid due to the appearance of the lunchbox, but if I drank it now...</span></p><p><span style="">[Thirst has recovered by 20.]</span></p><p><span style="">[Current thirst level: 91/100]</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Is it that delicious?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Seeing was believing I picked up a meatball and held it out to Yang Su-jin.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;No... Uh...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Why are you paying attention to the surroundings? Eat it quickly.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;....&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">She blushed, sweeping her hair behind her ears as she opened her mouth&#x2026; Something was strange but I kept holding it.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;..!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Yang Su-jin made a shocked expression. I was conscious of all the people looking at us. Anyway, it was nice that she brought some food. This discovery was quite meaningful.</span></p><p><span style="">So far, clearing the dungeon floors had only taken one or two hours at most. If there were no problems on the fourth floor then it would have only been one or two hours.</span></p><p><span style="">But what if the space kept expanding? Or there might be a time consuming event like this one.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Eat as much as you can now. As long as you can still move.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes.&#x201D; I looked over at the stage. </span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Excuse me, but is it delicious?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">There was a policy that people couldn&#x2019;t challenge the ring a second time, but this was still taking an unexpectedly long time. The reason for the constant fighting was that the number of opponents couldn&#x2019;t be precisely known. If I remained idle then there was a chance the game might be over.</span></p><p><span style="">In fact, I didn&#x2019;t think it was a good idea to jump in at the beginning. I had seen the first fight. I would jump in once the number of competitors decreased. I also wanted some time to read the books since I didn&#x2019;t know what would happen in the future. But now I was decided.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;What is your number?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Me? Well... Seven. I don&#x2019;t have many capabilities other than my regeneration ability.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">I nodded and waited. &#xA0;Once everyone was hungry...</span></p><p><span style="">Otherwise...</span></p><p><span style="">[Twenty-two.]</span></p><p><span style="">I wasn&#x2019;t confident about fulfilling this nonsense number. I wasn&#x2019;t a martial arts hero.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x25CE;</span></p><p><span style="">The time had come. I climbed up to the stage.</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p>
