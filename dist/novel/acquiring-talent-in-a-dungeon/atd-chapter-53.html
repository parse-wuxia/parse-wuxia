<p><span style="">Chapter 53 - &#xA0;Day 13 Natural Enemy</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p><p><span style="">Reality in the movies was a lot different from the real world. For example, the CIA wasn&#x2019;t an adventurous group that took missions like Mission Impossible everyday. It was just a government organization that had a lot of tedious paperwork. </span></p><p><span style="">Of course, this was just a passage that I read in a book, but it was something that I unconsciously accepted. Actual reality was far less than virtual reality. Funnily enough, I still thought like this despite the existence of the dungeon. </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;...&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">I couldn&#x2019;t help feeling surprised. Although this might be slightly exaggerated, it seemed like the whole mountain had been hollowed out to become this facility. It felt like a military base from a movie. There were armoured cars and tanks scattered throughout the wide space. </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Wait in the car for a moment.&#x201D; &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">Once the car parked inside the tunnel, Director Oh got out of the car. The facility was very wide, but the figures of people could rarely be seen. It looked like there was only a maintenance crew. </span></p><p><span style="">&quot;...Sheesh.&#x201D; &#xA0;Kim Tae-hyuk clicked his tongue from the front seat. It seemed like the sound wasn&#x2019;t directed towards me. </span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I guess this is something that you can&#x2019;t resolve.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;...!&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Kim Tae-hyun blushed at my words. Now his reaction was clearly visible. It seemed like Director Oh&#x2019;s request was something that incited jealousy in Kim Tae-hyun.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Was it due to an enormous reward? No, Director Oh hadn&#x2019;t said anything specific about a reward. Then&#x2026; Maybe it was something not connected to Director Oh. There might be someone else involved. </span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Do you have some advice as a person who failed? I would really appreciate it.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;...I could succeed. I just encountered a natural enemy...&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Natural enemy?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Kim Tae-hyun didn&#x2019;t say anything else. He just looked irritated. &#xA0;</span></p><p><i><span style="">-A delicious smell.</span></i></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&quot;...What?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Kim Tae-hyun turned around at my question. The voice I heard wasn&#x2019;t his. </span></p><p><i><span style="">-A delicious smell.</span></i></p><p><span style="">It was a voice I had heard before. And it wasn&#x2019;t a sound from the &#x2018;outside.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I&#x2019;m sorry. I have a habit of talking to myself.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">After that, I closed the soundproof barrier. Then I once again started &#x2018;talking to myself&#x2019;. </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What is with this bastard?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">The voice was coming from the divine creature. Isaiah had planted the bug in me and said it would soon wake up. Instead of answering, a shape popped out from my chest. It fell onto my thigh and then the backseat before wriggling its four legs. </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;...Dog?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">It wasn&#x2019;t a curse. It didn&#x2019;t look like an alien creature from the movies. Instead, it was like a puppy that wasn&#x2019;t even one month old yet. The breed... Siberian Husky? No. That wasn&apos;t the important thing. </span><span style="">The tail that hadn&#x2019;t fully grown wagged excitedly as he approached the nearest window. He lifted his legs and somehow raised his head to the window. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">Delicious!</span></i> <i><span style="">Delicious...</span></i></p><p><i><span style="">Deopsseok.</span></i></p><p><span style="">I grabbed the back of the dog&#x2019;s neck. There was a whining sound as the puppy&#x2019;s eyes met mine. </span></p><p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">It hurts!</span></i></p><p><span style="">I had no idea he could look so pitiful and cute but I ignored him. It was just like looking at a child throwing a tantrum. </span></p><p><span style="">&quot;What are you doing?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">I was wrong!</span></i> <i><span style="">I won&#x2019;t do it again.</span></i> <i><span style="">I won&#x2019;t.</span></i> <i><span style="">There is a delicious smell coming from there..</span></i><span style="">. </span></p><p><span style=""> I had footsteps stop outside the car. I growled at the sacred creature. </span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Whatever it is, enter my body again. If you look out then you will die.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Of course, I didn&#x2019;t really intend to kill it. The body of the small dog trembled with terror. It was shaking so much that I felt like I was holding an electric massage machine. </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Come along.&#x201D; I followed Director Oh. </span></p><p><span style="">I could see hatches placed at regular intervals on the walls. Finally, there was a steel door with locks that could be turned, like a bank vault. Maybe the real bomb shelter was beyond that door. It was a place where someone could survive a nuclear weapon. </span></p><p><span style="">Director Oh didn&#x2019;t take me through straight away, but instead moved to a control room where people were watching the situation. &#xA0;They had communication equipment and monitors on their desks. Just like a CCTV system, different areas were being shown on the monitors. </span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Has anything been caught?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&quot;No. Perhaps they are asleep. The sleep cycle is becoming noticeably irregular...&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Director Oh clicked his tongue. Then he looked at me and said. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;My request is simple. You would&#x2019;ve seen the door as we passed. There is someone I want you to restrain beyond that door.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Restrain? Not kill?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Director Oh nodded. </span><span style="">&quot;You absolutely can&#x2019;t kill or create a serious injury. If you think that you can&#x2019;t win then just give up and go. After the suppression is over, we should be able to put restraints on the person without any problems.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I understand. I still haven&#x2019;t heard about the compensation.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&quot;If this is completed successfully, I won&#x2019;t ask you to &#x2018;restrain&#x2019; someone again in the future.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">The meaning, &quot;Does that mean you will accept the offer from me?&#x201D; I asked. </span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I will permit it.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Director Oh nodded and we left the control room. Outside, armed soldiers were waiting. Their uniform wasn&#x2019;t that of simply soldiers. &#xA0;Although they were armed with tasers instead of normal guns, there was clearly tension on their faces. </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Based on the premise that you successfully subdue the person inside... I will accept all your requirements.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Okay.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">We crossed the bomb shelter. As we moved, I asked Director Oh. &#xA0;&quot;Is there anything else I should know?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Not really. But is there anything that you want to ask?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">There were many things. &quot;Who is inside?&quot; </span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I&#x2019;m not in a position to say.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">But the candidates had already been narrowed a lot. A human who could use this shelter at their own discretion. </span></p><p><span style="">&quot;In the first place, they aren&#x2019;t &#x2018;confined&#x2019; in there are they?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;...&#x201D; I understood the director&#x2019;s silence as agreement. </span></p><p><span style="">I had looked at the CCTV. It looked like a comfortable living space. It was a place suitable for &#x2018;refuge&#x2019; rather than &#x2018;confinement.&#x2019; Even if this was a bomb shelter, there were various places more suitable to confining someone. </span></p><p><span style="">Therefore, I guessed that the person wasn&#x2019;t trapped because they couldn&#x2019;t be controlled. A person might abuse the secure air base for dungeon exploration. In addition, the location of this place was confidential. There was virtually no threat to reality. </span></p><p><i><span style="">Ching.</span></i></p><p><span style="">The door to the bomb shelter was opened. The soldiers aimed their tasers at the entrance. Director Oh&#x2019;s body was shaking. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Close the door as soon as I enter.&#x201D; I stated.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Then...&quot; </span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I won&#x2019;t even think about running away.&#x201D; I asserted before taking a step inside. </span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Rather, it stops a path of retreat.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&quot;You look confident.&#x201D; Director Oh laughed bitterly. </span><span style="">&quot;Good luck.&quot; </span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Thank you.&quot; </span></p><p><i><span style="">Ching.</span></i></p><p><span style="">The door closed and I looked at the open space before me. It was the living space that I had seen on the CCTV. It looked like a VIP room from a luxury hotel. &#xA0;Of course, that wasn&#x2019;t what I was looking at. </span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;...Well.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">I took a few steps and saw the bodies. They wore suits instead of soldier uniforms. The bodies of unarmed men. Next to the couch, there were the bodies of two men in uniform, like the ones outside. </span><span style="">I now knew for certain. The extent of the corruption was confirmed. The men in the suits died much earlier. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">Delicious...</span></i> <i><span style="">The smell...</span></i></p><p><span style="">The voice sounded a little depressed. &#xA0;Just like when I opened my stats window, I asked a question in my mind. </span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;What is the delicious smell?&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style=""> -</span><i><span style="">Just my food...</span></i> <i><span style="">At that time, I ate a food that smelt good.</span></i> <i><span style="">Master as well...</span></i></p><p><span style=""> Then he added in a trembling voice. </span></p><p><span style=""> -</span><i><span style="">Ah...</span></i> <i><span style="">I...</span></i> <i><span style="">I will never eat Master.</span></i> <i><span style="">I won&#x2019;t eat.</span></i> <i><span style="">Don&apos;t bite me.</span></i></p><p><span style="">At that moment, the sound of footsteps overlapped with the voice. I turned around. </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;....&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">A woman with disheveled hair stood in front of me. &#xA0;The shadows under her eyes seemed to be due to extreme stress, not just lack of sleep. She hadn&#x2019;t washed in a few days, so a foul odor spread from her. &#xA0;Blood dripped from the thumb she was biting. </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;...You.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What?&#x201D; I knew what the girl was saying but I pretended not to so that I could step closer. &#xA0;</span></p><p><i><span style="">-A delicious smell!</span></i></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;...Don&#x2019;t...&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Fix your pronunciation. I can&#x2019;t understand.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Get away from me! You son of a bitch!&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;...!&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Despite how prepared I was, I still felt surprise. The women&#x2019;s atmosphere changed so dramatically. She was now foaming at the mouth and her bloodshot eyes were shaking. At the same time, a dark killing intent could be felt from her! </span></p><p><span style="">Of course, I heard her words but hadn&#x2019;t really understood the meaning. There was a shocking amount of hatred directed not at me, but at the world. </span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Kihi!&#x201D; She made a noise like a goblin and rushed towards me. </span></p><p><span style="">Fast! </span></p><p><span style="">Nevertheless, it was at a level that I could cope with. I stepped back and extended my fist. It was a punch at the abdomen with my strength restrained. I thought it would be enough to overpower her. &#xA0;It was a miscalculation. </span></p><p><i><span style="">Tak!</span></i></p><p><span style="">As she grabbed my fist with her arms, she raised her legs and wrapped them around my arms and shoulders. In the blink of an eye, one arm was broken. </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hihihi!&#x201D; She spat crazily as she looked at me and didn&#x2019;t move. The firmness and flexibility of my newly formed muscles and bones were good. I took a deep breath and grasped the hem of the woman&#x2019;s clothes with my locked arms. &#xA0;Then I swung the woman hanging onto my arm down towards the ground. &#xA0;</span></p><p><i><span style="">Teong!</span></i><span style=""> A groaned flowed from the woman&#x2019;s mouth. I wasn&#x2019;t aiming to hurt her but she was injured. I could tell from the force around my arm. As the force squeezing my arm weakened, I lifted her up and swung a second time. &#xA0;Her limbs were completely detached from my arms and I let go of her clothes. Her body flew to the other side. </span></p><p><i><span style="">Kung!</span></i></p><p><i><span style="">Jjeolgurong!</span></i></p><p><span style="">The place that she crashed into was a small bar/kitchen so there was a loud noise as the glass broken and household utensils fell. As expected, she immediately got up. &#xA0;Even though she experienced a tremendous force, she wasn&#x2019;t that hurt. &#xA0;The killing intent just thickened even further. &#xA0;</span></p><p><i><span style="">Syuok!</span></i></p><p><span style="">A frying pan hit my cheek and I fell back over the sofa. It wasn&#x2019;t just that. She threw all types of pots and utensils before rushing over to me. One hand was holding a knife used for meat. </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hiit!&#x201D; As she threw the knife at me, I slid down. Before the action was over, the knife she threw passed over my head in a breathtaking way. &#xA0;I rolled to avoid it and got up. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">I triggered Darkness Cloud. But surprising, apart from a momentary stiffness, she avoided my outstretched hand in the darkness. She backed away a few steps and stared for a moment, before continuing with her throwing attacks like she had spotted the core of the darkness. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">She seemed to have something that improved reflexes. I wasn&#x2019;t sure whether it was a talent or technique, but her movements couldn&#x2019;t be explained with simple agility. Furthermore, just looking at the physical abilities, she was the most outstanding among the individuals I had met so far in the dungeon. If I encountered her after just finishing the seventh floor, then I would probably be covered in blood by now. </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hihi! Hi! Hihihihi!&#x201D; &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">But my patience had already reached its limit. I lifted Darkness Cloud. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hihit!&#x201D; She grasped a frying pan and knife and rushed at me once again. The frying pan was aimed at my head while the knife headed towards my body. </span></p><p><i><span style="">Puok!</span></i></p><p><span style="">A cold blade was stabbed in my abdomen. </span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I got you.&#x201D; </span><span style="">I grabbed her wrists and growled. She seemed to want to use the same move as before but I wouldn&#x2019;t fall for the same trick twice. </span></p><p><i><span style="">Hwik!</span></i></p><p><span style="">As I held her wrists, I swung her entire body towards the ground. Despite not using my maximum strength, the impact from hitting the ground was no joke. &#xA0;I pulled out the knife stuck in my abdomen and slammed the blunt end down. Indeed, her face flattened like a pancake. A groan emerged from her mouth as her crushed nose started bleeding. I got on top of her. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">And I waited. </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hey!&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Shortly afterwards, the soldiers arrived with Director Oh. </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;...Didn&#x2019;t I tell you not to hurt her?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&quot;It is just a broken nose, not a serious injury.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">My words were irrefutable. Director Oh gave a command to the soldiers. Soon the soldiers approached and placed her in a straitjacket. </span></p><p><span style="">&quot;That will have no meaning. Perhaps after entering the dungeon and becoming stronger, she will just tear out of it.&#x201D; If it was put on me, then I would be able to tear out of it straight away. </span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I know. But... A mother wants to talk to her daughter for a little bit. She hasn&#x2019;t been able to be knocked out for a few days.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">I nodded as I looked at the people clearing the bodies in the room. </span><span style="">&quot;Anyway, I have fulfilled your request?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style=""> &#x201C;...Yes. In the future, I will leave the explorers to you... If you can&apos;t control them then I give you the right to kill them. I can give you this position if you want.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">This was a lot easier than I thought. </span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Soo-young!&#x201D; Shortly afterwards, a woman in her 50s entered the bomb shelter. &#xA0;She held the cheek of the woman called &#x2018;Soo-young&#x2019; in the cleaned room and cried while saying something. No matter what she did, Soo-young was still out of her mind. She even bit the woman&#x2019;s hand touching her cheek. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;...In the end, the most important thing in this world is power.&#x201D; Director Oh said while smoking his electronic cigarette. </span></p><p><span style="">&quot;In other words, you have to kill general explorers with your own hands.&#x201D; He was standing at the threshold of the bomb shelter with me. He looked at the painful reunion of the middle-aged woman. Then he started explaining.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;The signs started on the third day. On the third day that she left the dungeon, she sliced apart one of her friends.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Did you settle it?&#x201D; &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I still think about that day.&#x201D; Even though he had done many dirty work behind the scenes, he still reacted to that horror. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;The next day... I thought about gathering people like you together. There was a bitter taste in my mouth.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Although it might be sensitive information, there was a reason why the director told me this. A few days had passed so there was no evidence remaining and... First of all, he thought that I already knew the identity of the middle-aged woman. It was natural. Anybody with common sense would know that face. </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Anyway, thank you for the trouble. The additional compensation for this work... To be honest, I can&#x2019;t do it right now. Since that person is crying like that... But I&#x2019;ll submit the report later. I will surely keep my promise.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I believe you.&#x201D; I replied and took a few steps. It was towards the inside of the bomb shelter. Towards the middle-aged woman and Soo-young. </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;...Hey.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Director Oh knew where I was heading and grabbed my arm. &#xA0;&quot;I told you. You don&#x2019;t need to do anything with that girl anymore. I will keep my promise.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes. I also told you that I believe you. But...&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">I touched my abdomen. &#xA0;My natural recovery had grown to such a degree that an injury like this was easily healed. But I had still been stabbed by a knife. </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;There is something I need to get.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">With those words, I gently pulled my arm away from Director Oh. &#xA0;I immediately headed to the sofa where Soo-young was. </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;You...&#x201D; &#xA0;The woman, who was crying as she watched her daughter try to bite her, looked over at me. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I think it is terrible.&#x201D; I lowered myself to my knees and faced Soo-young. </span><span style="">&#x201C;If there was a way to get your daughter back, what would you do?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;...!&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Even if a person she didn&#x2019;t know was saying this, it was putting words into the ears of a desperate person. It was why cancer patients were deceived by scams and bought panaceas. This woman had confined her daughter, who had become a serial killer, instead of subjecting her to the laws of the country, so I knew her mindset. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I-If you can, anything...&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Think about your words carefully. Although this is a fairly important story.&#x201D; I smiled as I looked at the First Lady. </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Why don&#x2019;t you try talking about it with your husband?&#x201D;</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p>
