<p><span style="">Chapter 60 - &#xA0;Day 13, 10th Floor Big Picture (4)</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p><p><span style="">The two people on the top floor were in the same state as they were before. &#xA0;Perhaps these two were the owners of the castle. Outside the window, the noisy sounds of fighting were still continuing. It might be because the Chinese had wiped out most of the people in the castle, but it seemed like the tragedy inside wasn&#x2019;t known yet. &#xA0;It was better to get this done before it became louder. </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Si... Sister Sis...&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Oh, she is your sister?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">The boy groaned and stood up as I untied him. After all, it was only one arm that was broken. &#xA0;His legs trembled due to fear. </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;B... B... Bad people...&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Not demons?&#x201D; The boy looked at me with an expression like he didn&#x2019;t understand my words. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What is your name?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;...&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">I pulled out a bottle from my inventory. It was the potion taken from Kim Tae-hyun that I hadn&#x2019;t used much of. Now there wasn&#x2019;t much left. &#xA0;I poured a small drop on my finger, forced the boy&#x2019;s mouth opened and shoved it in. </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ugh... Kek... Keok...&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Did he think that he was eating poison? Then the boy felt something and he touched his broken arm. i asked, &#x201C;Has the pain gone away? The bones should be recovering.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">The boy took one step back and stood in front of his sister. She was hidden but I could hear constant groaning. </span></p><p><span style="">&quot;If you give me a good answer then I will drop the same thing into your sister&#x2019;s mouth.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Crazy. Dog scum...&#x201D; It wasn&#x2019;t a good answer, but then Jin Soo-young spoke. </span></p><p><span style="">&quot;You had such a thing... Give me a little...&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">I ignored her and looked at the boy, who shrugged his shoulders. </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I am&#x2026; Kino.&#x201D; &#xA0;Even though he was crying a lot, he quickly grasped the situation. The boy, Kino, continued speaking. &quot;W-We have no treasure. I told those people earlier several times. We just inherited this castle and the residents...&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ah. I don&apos;t care about that.&quot; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;...?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">I interrupted and checked that the woman hadn&#x2019;t stopped breathing before continuing. &#x201C;To the people below, you taught them that we are &#x2018;demons&#x2019;.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">The offer of citizenship appeared in front of Kino. Even though he was startled, Kino didn&#x2019;t show much amazement on his face. I couldn&#x2019;t find any signs of religious fear or horror. </span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Did the rule of rejecting people like us first begin in your generation?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Nope... No. I heard that...&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Oh, you don&apos;t need to explain in detail. What I really want to ask is the reason for such an education.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Sometimes the ruling class themselves were brainwashed by the myths and propaganda that they created, but I couldn&#x2019;t find any signs of that in the child in front of me. It was evidence that there was a purpose for that rule being created and taught. </span></p><p><span style="">Kino explained.&#xA0;</span><span style="">&quot;The words in front of me... If I respond to this &#x2018;revelation&#x2019; then I know that our land will be merged with yours. I learned that from my father and so on.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&quot;So?&quot; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;But... I learned that the result of such a unification has always been hopeless.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Through my experience in the jungle, I knew that several explorers had visited the dungeon before &#x2018;our world.&#x2019; So it was natural for some areas to have experience with integration in the past. </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;A &#x2018;king&#x2019; integrated this territory a few times, but there were always disputes with the residents. We weren&#x2019;t the only people living there.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Currently in Talia, two forces existed. The inhabitants of the forest and the residents from Jin Soo-young&#x2019;s city. Even if they were &#x2018;Tellans&#x2019;, it was clear that they would have cultural differences. It would be strange if there were no disputes. Maybe they were still fighting now. </span></p><p><span style="">&quot;My ancestors constantly brought the matter before the king to mediate the strife, but the king... He didn&#x2019;t solve the problem at all. According to the rules of the gods...&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&quot;We haven&#x2019;t been here long.&#x201D; Well, it wouldn&#x2019;t be much different from explorers of other worlds. I couldn&#x2019;t afford to act as king if it meant giving up time in the real world. </span></p><p><span style="">&quot;In the end, the king constantly brought in new forces without resolving the conflicts, creating more... In the end, the kingdom was destroyed and the territories split apart again. There was no meaning and the fallout was just disorder and disputes...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I see. It&#x2019;s okay. That is sufficient.&#x201D; I waved my hands. </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Once again, we really have no treasure. So please spare my sister.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Well... Unlike you, your sister will need a lot of potions. To be honest, I really don&#x2019;t want to use such a precious thing.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Kino&#x2019;s face distorted at my words. Of course, I had already made a decision from the beginning. I poured the last few drops of the potion into Kino&#x2019;s sister&#x2019;s mouth. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;T-Thank you!&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">I looked around the room. It was clearly a place where the lord resided, but there was a scruffy feeling that was no different from the rest of the castle. The wall decorations and furniture were definitely old-fashioned and showed the signs of age. However, they must be well managed to maintain the original antiquity after such a long time. </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Do the people here listen to you?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Huh?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Despite having no treasures and your sister only being a few years older than you, the both of you have managed to make the people outside listen. That makes me wonder.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">He didn&#x2019;t have a clear answer. I changed the question. &quot;What do you or your sister do as the lord?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Kino saw that his sister was being healed and answered with a more relaxed atmosphere than before. &quot;I, I just help out my sister... We are responsible for conducting the planting of the moss and the funerals for the old... If a new baby is born then we officiate the ceremony. Everything in the castle, such as management and...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Indeed.&#x201D; Kino&#x2019;s sister started coughing. &#x201C;Bring the water.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Kino quickly obeyed. As he poured water into her mouth from the kettle, she started coughing out blood. </span></p><p><span style="">I poured the rest of the water on her face. A face that wasn&#x2019;t that much older than Kino was revealed. If Kino looked like he was in the 2nd year of high school, then she would be around a 3rd year university student? </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;...Ah.&#x201D; Eyes with deep double eyelids stared at the ceiling. Then she became astonished as she saw me. </span></p><p><span style="">As her eyes flashed, I quickly stepped back. Then I gave Kino instructions. &quot;Calm her down. Do it until we can have a conversation.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Kino ran into his sister&#x2019;s arms. He touched his sister&#x2019;s cheeks, that were neatly restored, and whispered a few words while sobbing. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;You are a saint.&#x201D; In the meantime, Jin Soo-young was sitting down to alleviate her pain. Her voice was quite clear. </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes. Doesn&#x2019;t the sight fill you with pride?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Not at all.&quot; Jin Soo-young frowned. I looked down at her. </span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I thought your mind wasn&#x2019;t bad.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Still. You should study more, like your father. Your mind will improve if you read a few history books.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Leaving the speechless Jin Soo-young behind me, I walked forward again. Kino had told his sister that I had saved them. However, her eyes didn&#x2019;t seem friendly as she gazed at me while hugging her brother. </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;... Thank you for sparing the life of me and my brother, King.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&quot;It&apos;s nothing.&quot; </span></p><p><span style="">&quot;But we... We won&#x2019;t follow you.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Shouldn&#x2019;t you listen before deciding?&#x201D; Obviously, there was a place somewhere in this castle where integration was possible. </span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Of course, it is possible but you should&#x2019;ve seen it. Even if you bring the people of this land to your territory... Only chaos will occur. You won&#x2019;t be able to keep it.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;... Aha.&#x201D; I was impressed. </span><span style="">&quot;Is that why you developed the rules of the religion?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;...I just finished what Father planned.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">At first, it was just a rule to reject the offer of citizenship. However, wouldn&#x2019;t a third party frown at the thought of a religion? In fact, Jin Soo-young had already described the residents of this place as fanatics. </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Great.&#x201D; To an outsider, this was just a barren territory with fanatics. The idea of integration would be dropped instantly. Even if they killed the lord for the sake of treasure, the territory would just be ignored instead of integrated. </span></p><p><span style="">But rather, I needed to integrate this land. &quot;You know the integration place, right? Please guide me.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;...!&#x201D; The woman&#x2019;s eyes shook. </span></p><p><span style="">&quot;What... Didn&apos;t I tell you? This place...&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes. I still want to do it.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&quot;If you are looking for treasures, of course there was a time when my family had relics. But after several integrations...&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&quot;One remains.&#x201D; I pointed my finger and declared. &#x201C;You.&#x201D; Kino&apos;s sister. </span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Aren&#x2019;t you at the top of this religion? Despite the religion only have a short history, you only need to say a few words and the residents will follow you.&#x201D; &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I will never...&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I will give you the right to rule.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">I heard Jin Soo-young take a sharp breath from behind me. It was the same for the woman. </span></p><p><span style="">&quot;What...?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&quot;It is like I said. I will give you the right to rule my territory and all the people living in it.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">So far, I hadn&#x2019;t paid much attention to the governance of my city. When I thought about it, the city was definitely part of the dungeon. Even Isaiah would get more power the more the city was active. Instead of neglecting the inhabitants, was there a way to organize them into one community? </span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I think your skills are sufficient.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">In history, the means that the ruling class used to justify their rights varied. They could monopolize information only they knew, promote social discipline or lead ceremonies. Of course, that alone didn&#x2019;t make them a ruler. Sometimes it was necessary to borrow the power of armed forces or wealth, but that wasn&#x2019;t the case in this castle. &#xA0;It was the planting of moss, management of goods and various ceremonies. It felt like they had squeezed everything possible from this land. The difference was more prominent compared to the forest. A culture and rules were maintained here under a unified leader, compared to the forest where the population was scattered. </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;My city has a sun. There are no metals to be used as raw material yet, but there is a blacksmith for quality goods and breeding grounds for livestock. I will leave it to you.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Their ancestors had been tired of the chaos. But, that was when their ancestors were one of the many neglected. &#xA0;They didn&#x2019;t have a position as the ruler. </span></p><p><span style="">&quot;But by what authority...&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Authority? Why worry about it? It is my authority.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">I could still wield ultimate power in the city. I could give and take citizenship away at will. I just couldn&apos;t pour my effects into the city due to time being the same as reality. </span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I can give you as much authority as you like. I will support you... Well, a more reliable guarantee should be given when thinking about the people who would come in the future. I want you to be my empress.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;...!!!&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">I just threw a word that I thought of. It seemed they needed to discuss it. </span></p><p><span style="">I moved away and gave a signal to Kino. The boy had distanced himself from his sister without knowing it while listening to the conversation. I approached his sister&#x2019;s chair and bowed. After lowering myself to my knees so that we were eye level, I placed my hand on her thigh and asked. </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What is your name?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;...Mino...&#x201D; &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes. Mino. I need a companion. Someone who will rule my city when I&#x2019;m not there. Don&#x2019;t you also want your people to live in a better environment? These are people who followed you and your family faithfully. </span><span style="">They deserve to see the sun.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Eye contact was always effective. &quot;And once again, I think you are well qualified.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;...&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Let&#x2019;s go together.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">At that time, I heard yelling from outside the door. The news of intruders had spread and the people outside were coming up. </span></p><p><i><span style="">Tang!</span></i></p><p><span style="">There was the sound of the door opening and the desperate expressions of the residents calling their lord. &quot;Lord!&quot; </span></p><p>As the agitated residents tried to storm the room, &#xA0;&quot;Stand down.&quot; Mino raised her palm and stopped them.</p><p><span style="">&#x201C;This person, he came to save us.&#x201D;</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p>
