Honestly, it would be best to eat up everything alone. If I took care of all the monsters without any help then I could gain all the experience and get the boxes.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">But I couldn&#x2019;t send the two people away.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">There was a large number of goblins. I had a 50/50 chance to succeed alone, but the odds weren&#x2019;t stable. Instead, I chose the middle ground. &#x201C;Let&#x2019;s go together.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;I-I don&apos;t want to. No, I can&apos;t go.&#x201D; An Su-hyun was shaking.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;There were two E ranked... That enemy upstairs...&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;I will take care of both E ranks.&#x201D; In fact, it had to be like this. Killing the two E rank goblins would give better rewards, and I wanted them. &quot;And I will allow you to pick one box.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;O-one?&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">An Su-hyun stuttered with an absurd expression. I pulled a sword from my inventory. It was the &#x2018;Elmer&#x2019;s Dummy Destroyer&#x2019; that An Su-hyun dropped yesterday.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;That is my...&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Why is this yours?&#x201D; I frowned at An Su-hyun who was about to approach. I didn&#x2019;t bring it out to give to him.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;You dropped it. Now it&#x2019;s mine. It isn&#x2019;t just this. Thanks to you, I received the Punching skill. It was easier than I thought to fight against the dummy. The reward was good.&quot;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">I mixed my words with lies and twirled the sword in front of me.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;I won&#x2019;t prevent you if you go down the safe stairs. Go down right now if you want. It will be a bit riskier, but I&#x2019;ll get one more box. You gave it up. Just like this sword.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;...&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;I wonder what&apos;s down on the fourth floor. You don&#x2019;t know what type of person will come down and there might be harsher conditions than these goblins. Will you also whine and try to move onto the next floor?&quot;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;No.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;No what?&#x201D; I snorted with derision.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Didn&#x2019;t you come down here yesterday with the expectation of receiving something?&#x201D; I knew An Su-hyun to a certain extent. He was a type that was 180 degrees different from me, but he also wasn&#x2019;t satisfied with the reality given to him.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Until when will you live as a bug crawling up your parents&#x2019; backs?&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Be careful...&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;What will you do if I&#x2019;m not careful? There is no reason for me to care. You are garbage that has no room for improvement.&#x201D; An Su-hyun was silent.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;Then... Give me more boxes.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;No.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;T-There are so many. Are you going to keep all of them to yourself?&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;Yes.&#x201D; It didn&#x2019;t matter if it was appropriate distribution or not, because I was the one making the decision about the distribution. The most important thing was my own survival.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;If you feel wronged then try to do better on the next floor. Wouldn&#x2019;t it be better to obtain one box before going down?&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;...&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">[Talent has been acquired.]</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">[Talent - Persuasion: The ability to persuade others to follow you without violence.

Personally, I thought it would be useless. Of course, a woman&#x2019;s body was never weak. &#xA0;They were capable of wielding a blunt weapon just like adult men. However, the important thing was the mental state. She didn&#x2019;t seem to have the mental state to kill something.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;Me too... I understand after listening to your words. If I go down to the next floor then I won&#x2019;t be able to do anything... If you give me a box then I&#x2019;ll be grateful.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;I won&#x2019;t stop you, but if you get in the way or try to interfere then there will be no box.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;Yes, I&#x2019;ll work hard.&#x201D; I beckoned to both of them. I stopped just before the hallway and issued instructions.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;I&apos;ll will sneak to the other side using the pillars. Stay here, but as I go to the other side, scream and draw attention.&#x201D; The narrow passage meant the two of them would be able to fight quite a lot of goblins.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">It would have been crazy if they tried to lure all the goblins. It was good to fight against the safe stairs.

I stood on the opposite side of the entrance and waited.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;Ack!&#x201D; An Su-hyun started shouting. The goblins responded immediately. 1/3rd of them rushed towards the direction of the passage. As I speculated, the two E ranked didn&#x2019;t move. Rather, they paced to the opposite side.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">I waited for 30 seconds. Once the moving goblins were completely uphill, I activated my ability.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Activate. Limiter Release.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">All sensation in my body disappeared. I jumped down the stairs, and there was a goblin warden not far away. &#xA0;I ignored the smaller ones and threw a punch with all my strength.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt"><em>Ujik.</em></span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">There was the loud sound of facial bones breaking and the goblin warden collapsed. What? Was it the same level as regular goblins?

Endure. Endure. I also had the Pain Tolerance talent. I could do it. I clenched my fist and went to work. Two goblins fell down. I felt a pain flare up on my side.

The experience was causing Pain Tolerance to rise. Once I finished the 14th goblin, I had three rows of nail marks on my thighs but there was a gap in their ranks.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">I took care of 25 enemies.

You&#x2019;re stepping backwards again.&#x201D; If I told the truth? I&#x2019;d rather have everything. If not, I would have been very angry. I also didn&#x2019;t like this guy. He was the type of person who chose to give up and die when things became even a little difficult. I formed a fist.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt"><em>Baduk.</em></span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#xA0;A smile spread across my face.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;Once again.

The hand holding the club dropped down and his body started shaking as he moved backwards.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;Ah... Ohh...&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">An Su-hyun reached the area that was right in front of the stairs.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;I have nothing to give you so take the stairs together.&#x201D; Yoo Su-jeong, who had a look of dismay on her face, bowed. She spoke with a small sigh.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;... Really useless.&#x201D; The next moment, blood was strewn across the staircase.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Kuk...!&#x201D; An Su-hyun&#x2019;s eyes widened with surprise and he couldn&#x2019;t grasp the situation at all.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;Ahh.

She pulled the knife out of An Su-hyun without any hesitation. Blood gushed out like a fountain and he stared with disbelieving eyes&#x2026; Yoo Su-jeong paid no attention to him at all.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;I had hoped, but I guess it was too greedy to think about killing Hee-chul ssi. But even so, he was a very pathetic person... Isn&#x2019;t that right?&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Yoo Su-jeong moved backwards towards the safe stairs while smiling at me. It seemed like she wasn&#x2019;t a stupid woman.</span></p><hr><p></p><p></p></div><p></p>
