Even so, I hadn&#x2019;t thought about always killing my opponents. The &#x2018;Persuasion&#x2019; talent existed, so I had thought about solving some things through intimidation or a conversation.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">But if the system was like this then things were different. If I killed instead, then wouldn&#x2019;t I get the talents of that person?

It was the same with negotiations and deals. Who would do such ineffective things? It was impossible for faith to be established.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">I needed to be prepared. From now on, there would be no self-defense.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">I moved in the direction that the goblin pharmacist had escaped to. I wanted to encounter someone else after gaining Scratchy&#x2019;s strength, but the fourth floor was quite spacious. The goblin pharmacist had thrown bottles. Scratchy had suffered greatly from only two bottles. If I could obtain them, then I would gain an advantage when fighting others.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">[The level of a talent has risen.]</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">[Cartography.

My hands were free! I could respond more quickly. I raised my hands into a combat stance and prepared for any bottles that could come flying. One step forward. Another step.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">[Talent has been acquired.]</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">[Talent - Stealth: The ability to walk covertly, concentration and agility will rise according to your level.]</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">I walked around for 20 minutes, and my stealth was close to reaching level two. Then I stiffened as I heard a scream from outside my field of view.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">It was a scream-- A woman&apos;s scream. I walked for a while and light started to appear in front of me. There was a curve in the path that I peeked around, trying to stealthily see the sights that stretched out before me.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Just like the hallway last time, the source of light were torches. There was a village in a wide space, with conical tents and goblins scattered around them.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">The screams were coming from there. I had to pass through the area that the scream came from anyway. I moved my head slightly and shouted as hard as I could.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;KYAH?&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Kyak!&#x201D; The goblins among the tents reacted. I immediately pulled back. My fists were waiting in front of the curved path. Within a few seconds, the first victim popped out from around the corner.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;Kik?&#x201D; My fist slammed straight into its face.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt"><em>Bakak.</em></span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">The hit made the goblin stumble backwards and become entangled with the ones behind it.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">The terrain was good. The curve of the narrow passage was to my advantage. No matter how many goblins came at me, only one or two could attack at a time-- and there was no need to worry about things thrown from a distance.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">The only thing left was for me to punch without making any mistakes in my timing.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Pant... Pant...!&#x201D; I panted harshly as the corpses of the goblins came up to my knees when everything was finished. I moved my head past the curve and yelled again.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">No more goblins came out. I walked between the tents and looked carefully in each one. There was nothing. Even if there were some boxes, only japtem of E rank or less appeared.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;Ahh!&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;...!&#x201D; &#xA0;The screams stopped for a while before starting again. But unlike earlier, the screaming sounded strange. I passed through the tents.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">At the end of the tents and near another passage leading to a big and colourful tent. I went inside, then stiffened for a moment.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;Kyak?&#x201D; I was looking at the back of a goblin pharmacist.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">It was holding the handle of a pulley and trying to raise something so it would be &#x2018;hanging&#x2019; off the ground. It wasn&#x2019;t holding a bottle in its hand. I immediately extended my fist.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt"><em>Kung.</em></span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Once the goblin died, the &#x2018;thing hanging&#x2019; fell to the ground. I looked at it... No, I was looking at a person.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;Hi... Ugh...&#x201D; The high school girl was naked and groaning on the ground. It would have been hard to recognize her if her face hadn&#x2019;t been mainly left alone. The schoolgirl smelt of medications. Had she been experimented on?</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">There was a funnel in her mouth. There were already many empty bottles rolling around. At a glance, all the blood vessels in her body had been poisoned and her limbs were spasming.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;...Ah.&#x201D; As the funnel moved inside her mouth, I could see that a section of her tongue had been cut. This was the cause behind the different screams. Her eyes were bleary with pain as she looked at me. Astonishment crossed the pain-filled face.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;Eu, euuuuh...!&#x201D; Her body wriggled desperately. I took one step towards her.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;Ple... se... P-please...&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;What are you saying?&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;Hah... Don&#x2019;t do i... Don&#x2019;t...&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">It wasn&#x2019;t &#x2018;help me&#x2019; but &#x2018;don&#x2019;t do it.&#x2019; What shouldn&#x2019;t I do? It seemed she was conscious of her nakedness. She raised her knees and used both hands to cover her groin. I didn&#x2019;t care about her nakedness.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">She thought I would do something. The motions were something she did unconsciously. Tears formed in her eyes as she begged.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;Please... Please&#x2026;&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;....&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">I thought about tearing her apart. To be honest, there was still some anger remaining. Being framed for rape was a very disgusting experience. The schoolgirl still had a lot of HP left, but she was paralyzed and couldn&#x2019;t move her body.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">If I wanted, I could make her feel pain until she died. It was a shame that a woman absolutely didn&#x2019;t want to go through. I approached her and knelt down.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Close your eyes.&quot;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;Hi...&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;I will kill you. But I won&#x2019;t do anything shameful.&#x201D; Her eyes gazed at me. I raised a fist. &quot;I&apos;ll finish it as painless as possible.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Opportunity shouldn&#x2019;t be wasted. Not only would it take time, but I was about to take her life. It was the most precious thing for a human. &#xA0;No matter how much I was filled with greed, I didn&#x2019;t desire anything else from her.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;So... Close your eyes.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;....&#x201D; Tears flowed down as the schoolgirl closed her eyes. Fear? No, it was subtle, but it felt different. Relief... Maybe it was remorse.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;S... Sorr... Really... Really sorr...&#x201D; I accepted the apology as I formed a fist.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt"><em>Jaengurang.</em></span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt"><em>Wuk.</em></span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">I was in shock for a moment. My whole head felt wet. Fragments of broken glass feel to the ground.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">I turned to look, and there was a goblin pharmacist at the entrance of &#xA0;the tent. There was apparently one left, but there was nothing wrong with my body.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">I immediately turned and rushed to the entrance as I tackled the goblin.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;Kyakyak!&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">I struck the back of its head. Two hits. Three hits. The floor was soaked with the blood of the goblin.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Blood? Why was I bleeding? Ah, a nosebleed. My body started wobbling. I raised my hand from the ground. Nose, mouth and eyes. Blood dripped on the floor, escaping from every hole on my face.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Activate. Limiter Release.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">The dizziness didn&#x2019;t disappear. I tried to stand up, only for my head to hit the ground.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">[Current Balance: 115/140]</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">[Poison - Bleeding/ Nerve paralysis.

My eyes couldn&#x2019;t open so I had no way of knowing what it was. I just knew that a bitter liquid was being poured into my mouth.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;Dri... You should drink it al...&#x201D; But what was it? ...No, before that. Who? But the questions didn&#x2019;t emerge from my mouth as I lost consciousness again.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x25CE;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">My eyes opened, and I sat up. I was inside the goblin tent. It was the tent where I found the schoolgirl. I turned to look, but the place where the schoolgirl had been was empty.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;...Ah.&#x201D; There was a little surprised noise. I looked back and saw the schoolgirl. She was fine.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">... Of course, she was naked but that was all. She was standing on her own two feet and watching me. All the poisoned blood vessels and wounds were gone.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;Excuse me...&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Her mouth only opened slightly but I was certain. Her severed tongue had grown back again. &#x201C;Hey. What are you?&#x201D; I frowned and approached with clenched fists. I knew the situation. I didn&#x2019;t know what she was, but the girl had fully recovered from her wounds. She was the one who poured something down my throat.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">But the question was why she did it. If she killed me then she could get everything. &quot;What are you up to?

I want to stay here a bit more...&#x201D; The girl stuttered like she realized what strange things she was saying. &quot;First of all, r-receive this.&#x201D; She handed over a bag full of bottles.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;T-they are all safe.
