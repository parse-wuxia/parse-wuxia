<p><span style="">Chapter 21 - &#xA0;Day 6, 6th Floor Leading Figure</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p><p><span style="">The stairs continued to disappear.</span></p><p><span style="">Once half the staircase disappeared, the peak started to shake. Of course, at that point we had already gone down the stairs. &quot;They&#x2019;re looking at us.&#x201D; Like Yang Su-jin said, the people from the other staircase were looking at our group. I had a gut feeling about the circumstances. We had arrived at the peak almost simultaneously.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;What&#x2019;s your name? I&#x2019;m Han Sang-ho, 35 years old.&#x201D; A considerably large man came out as a representative of the seven of them with an axe on his shoulder. I hadn&#x2019;t seen any of their faces on the 5th floor. Were they gathered from &#x2018;another&#x2019; 5th floor? Maybe there was a balance.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Kim Hee-chul.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;You look young, approximately 20 years old?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;23.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;What rank were you on the 5th floor?&#x201D; It was a very natural transition.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Number one.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;...&#x201D; A slight hesitation was seen. Then a dubious expression crossed Han Sang-ho&#x2019;s face. He studied me with a smile and shrugged. &#x201C;I suppose it doesn&#x2019;t matter. I was fourth. Well, that isn&#x2019;t important. Have you thought of a way to break through that?&#x201D; Han Sang-ho pointed to the stairs going down.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;It is impossible to get through without sacrificing at least one person. So I have a suggestion for you.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Han Sang-ho turned and pointed to his companions. I could guess before even hearing it. Two of the six people. One was a pale teenage boy and the other a frightened girl. &quot;There is no guarantee that we won&#x2019;t encounter other people at the end. Furthermore, they might be &#x2018;people like us,&#x2019; so isn&#x2019;t it better to leave the stronger people to the end?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">He had selected scapegoats. That was Han Sang-ho&#x2019;s main point. &#x201C;I will pick three people and you should also pick some from your side. How about it, isn&#x2019;t it a decent offer? There is no need for useless conflicts. Let&#x2019;s go peacefully. Huh?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Han Sang-ho placed the axe on the ground and extended a burly arm. I took his hand. &#x201C;Okay. Let&#x2019;s be friends.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Han Sang-ho grinned. At the same time, Han Sang-ho poured strength into his arm. A tremendous pressure tried to crush my hand. His eyes showed that he was looking forward to my screams. He was confident in strength. This was his plan. He didn&#x2019;t believe that I was first place and decided to act.</span></p><p><span style="">If I was my original self then it would&#x2019;ve hurt. However, now I didn&#x2019;t feel any pain.</span></p><p><span style="">[Muscle strength has exceeded the limit.]</span></p><p><span style="">[Muscle strength: Fourteen.]</span></p><p><i><span style="">Crunch.</span></i></p><p><span style="">It wasn&#x2019;t the sound of my joints but the sound of Han Sang-ho&#x2019;s bones breaking. &#xA0;It was very clear who the one groaning was: they was coming from Han Sang-ho&#x2019;s mouth. &#x201C;... Uck!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">He frowned and flinched, &#x201C;Hah... This is a little...&#x201D; Then his face distorted and his upper body shook. Han Sang-ho felt himself weakening. &#x201C;Hey... S-stop.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;...&#x201D; I kept using my strength. He was the one who wanted to suppress me with strength in the first place.</span></p><p><i><span style="">Crunch.</span></i></p><p><span style="">&quot;This is crazy! Stop...!&quot; Saliva fell from Han Sang-ho&#x2019;s mouth as his face turned red. He diverted his strength into his opposite hand that reached down and grabbed the axe, but my other hand also wasn&#x2019;t empty. I threw the bottle I was holding into Han Sang-ho&#x2019;s face. &quot;Ack!&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">I grabbed Han Sang-ho at the groin area and picked him up, then walked towards the end of the peak. No one was able to stop me. Han Sang-ho couldn&#x2019;t even swing his axe, let alone the people behind me. There was a scream as Han Sang-ho was thrown in the air.</span></p><p><span style="">A leech rose from the darkness to snatch him before disappearing. Within a few seconds, the leech couldn&#x2019;t be seen in the darkness anymore. The overall level wouldn&#x2019;t be reduced just by losing one person. A handful needed to be missing before it fell apart.</span></p><p><span style="">I needed to make sure that no one tried to push me down the stairs. </span></p><p><span style="">I turned around, but everyone was stiff. Of course, there were seven of us and six of them.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;You just, Sang-ho hyung-nim...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Did you know him? Sorry. He was talking nonsense.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Does that make sense? You son of a bitch!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Don&#x2019;t be like that.&#x201D; I laughed. Then I pointed to the man complaining. &quot;You are number two?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What?&#x201D; I raised a fist.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;You&apos;re next.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;...!&#x201D; The number two took out a stick. But...</span></p><p><i><span style="">Seuk.</span></i></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Eh?&#x201D; His forearm was cut off before he could swing it. A strike from the side. It was from Kim Ha-jong&#x2019;s sword. They became familiar with something as we descended the stairs.</span></p><p><span style="">I focused on the opponent while moving my left hand. When I created a specific shape with my fingers, they had to do the corresponding action. Immediately after throwing Han Sang-ho, I had spread out the index finger and thumb of my left hand. In other words, strike the opponent.</span></p><p><span style="">Under normal conditions, people would hesitate to attack even if there was a signal. So I had made the situation easier. I got rid of Han Sang-ho and picked a second person with my taunts. This was enough to create an opportunity.</span></p><p><span style="">[The level of a talent has risen.]</span></p><p><span style="">[Leadership Lv 3 2/400.]</span></p><p><span style="">[Eloquence has exceeded the limit.]</span></p><p><span style="">[Eloquence: 10]</span></p><p><span style="">[Charisma has exceeded the limit.]</span></p><p><span style="">[Charisma: 12]</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Be careful not to kill him. As soon as he loses his breath, another person will be a substitute.&#x201D; The feedback was clear. I wouldn&#x2019;t weaken the opponent for no reason. It was a one-sided game. After getting rid of the leader and a second person, the rest became unable to think about fighting back.</span></p><p><span style="">Peace? Han Sang-ho&#x2019;s words were foolish. I laughed just thinking about it. Peace was a long distance away... Although it seemed to be a rough solution to this floor, it wasn&#x2019;t a reliable solution.</span></p><p><span style="">The leeches didn&#x2019;t just bite, but slowly squeezed out the blood of a person. It would almost certainly be painful. The idea of having scapegoats wasn&#x2019;t bad. However, everyone was at risk of being thrown except the leader and one or two other people.</span></p><p><span style="">There would be no unity. Of course, some people might follow the leader but that was because of fear. This floor needed unity. It was a device that bound seven people together, but only temporarily. If it was seven against seven then the situation wouldn&#x2019;t have changed. After all, I had already branded three people who I could throw away.</span></p><p><span style="">Six desperate faces bowed down, kneeling on the ground. Kim Ha-jong stood in front of them like an executioner and asked. &#x201C;Hyung-nim. Should we throw them all?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;... Hyung-nim?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Uh, you are older than me... Didn&#x2019;t you know? Haha.&#x201D; Kim Ha-jong awkwardly scratched his head. His original nature was very fussy but it felt like he had gradually relaxed.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;If you feel uncomfortable...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Do what you like.&#x201D; It wouldn&#x2019;t make a difference. No matter how outwardly submissive he seemed, I would only trust him when it was convenient.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Do you think that makes sense?&#x201D; Yang Su-jin&apos;s sharp voice rang out. She was confronting Lee Min-ju and Lee Sang-hoon.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;What&apos;s the problem? I already told you that I will do my brother&#x2019;s share.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;So he is just going to stay still? Everybody is risking their lives but what is he doing? Just sucking on his fingers.&#x201D; It wasn&#x2019;t hard to find the cause of the fight. In the fight against the lizardmen, Yang Su-jin had participated using the launcher. However, Lee Sang-hoon had just stayed in the background.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Hey, I&#x2019;m talking to you! Don&#x2019;t you dare avoid my gaze!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;...&#x201D; But Lee Sang-hoon didn&#x2019;t raise his eyes to the end. Yang Su-jin and Lee Min-ju simultaneously turned towards me. One side wanted punishment. The other wanted me to intervene.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;It can&#x2019;t be helped if he can&#x2019;t contribute due to a lack of ability.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">But&#x2026; &quot;But that doesn&#x2019;t mean that he can do nothing. Is this the second time? There will be no third time.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">I pointed at the cliff with my thumb.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;If you do nothing the next time we encounter something, I will treat you as the very first volunteer if I need a scapegoat.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;T-that...! You obviously promised me...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Doing the share of two people. Isn&#x2019;t that what you proposed? Can you be confident that you can do the share of two people with all these members?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;... Well, his words aren&#x2019;t wrong.&#x201D; Kim Ha-jong offered his opinion. Kwak Yu-han was just watching silently. It wasn&#x2019;t the time to be overcome by emotions. Lee Min-ju had no justification. There was already a certain level of group consciousness.</span></p><p><span style="">As the sense of belonging grew, the hostility towards those who got a free ride would grow stronger. The next time... At that time, Lee Sang-hoon would have to demonstrate his skills. Then I would be certain. The evidence pointed to him being the second ranked.</span></p><p><span style="">I asked the six who were kneeling down. &quot;From the right. Tell me your rank.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;9-98.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;15...6.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&quot;144.&quot; So far, the answers were all high numbers.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;...36.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;25. I-I will do whatever you say. S-spare me.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;12.&#x201D; Compared to the first three, the rankers seemed to have some confidence. They believed that they wouldn&#x2019;t be the first to die. I would keep them alive for as long as possible in order to take their talents.</span></p><p><span style="">That&#x2019;s what they thought, but&#x2026; &quot;Start heading down. Go in the order of the strongest ranked first.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Huh? In order of the ranking? Not the reverse? &quot;</span></p><p><span style=""> &#x201C;Yes.&#x201D; The involved people couldn&#x2019;t believe it.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;No, wait a minute. Why are we going first? Why...?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Be quiet. I don&#x2019;t want to kill you.&#x201D; It wasn&#x2019;t just about going down the stairs. They were captured prisoners, so I needed to notice any irregularities that occurred. The atmosphere made them all agree without hesitation.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yoo Su-jeong. Kwak Yu-han. Kim Ha-jong, take the lead with the three strongest ones. After that will be Lee Min-ju and Lee Sang-hoon. Yang Su-jin. I will be next. The three lower ranked will be between me and Yang Su-jin.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Then I spoke to the three lower ranked.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;You will be put in the back of the line. Still, that doesn&#x2019;t mean you are safe from the leeches. If you don&#x2019;t want to be food for a leech, then don&#x2019;t rebel.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">There will still several things I wanted from the six captured people. I wanted to make them spit out some items. However, the collapse of this peak was near. I finally stepped on the stairs.</span></p><p><span style="">Then I muttered in a low voice. &quot;Yoon Ji-hee.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;...!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Rank 156 was the lowest ranked person. The woman walking in front of me flinched. &quot;Keep walking. Don&#x2019;t show any signs. Just look in front of you. Listen to my words.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;... Do you know me?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;We go to the same school.&#x201D; However, it was different. She was in business administration. A junior one year younger than me. She didn&#x2019;t know me, but I knew her. &quot;You don&#x2019;t want to die here.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes, yes...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I will allow you to survive this floor. However, it depends on whether or not you want to cooperate with me on the next floor.&#x201D; At the moment, a moan emerged from her mouth. Joy? Relief? There was a sound, no matter how quiet she tried to make it.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Quiet.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I-I&apos;m sorry. I... What do I have to do?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Think as much as possible. Until we escape from this floor.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;...&#x201D; The people in front stopped as they reached the darkness.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;The conversation ends here. Don&#x2019;t talk now.&#x201D; Kwak Yu-han threw off the number two person at the front of the line. The sight of the leech in front of their eyes was overwhelming. Ahead of me, Yoon Ji-hee was almost crying. I never imagined that Yoon Ji-hee would be a crybaby, but it didn&#x2019;t matter.</span></p><p><span style="">Unless she had a lack of imagination, she should be able to understand what she could do for me. She wasn&#x2019;t very famous in school, but I had heard about her from a senior. She was the granddaughter of Yoon Sang-gyu, chairman of the UZ Group. Perhaps that was as valuable as this dungeon itself.</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p>
