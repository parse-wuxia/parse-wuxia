I hadn&#x2019;t tied the strings yet but I could feel that the texture perfectly adhered to the shape of my arm. Once I made a fist, the parts attached to my fingers gently folded. Indeed.

But it didn&#x2019;t feel that way at all.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">There was no need to observe An Su-hyun as the fact was soon disclosed.

What is this?&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">He expressed so clearly that he had received a talent. It was the first time he received a talent. An Su-hyun stared at his legs that were covered with the fluids of rats and salamanders.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Then he suddenly kicked the air. Was it a kick?</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Certainly An Su-hyun had successfully killed the monsters just through kicking.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;What is it?&quot; I asked and for a moment, it seemed like An Su-hyun was going to answer.

I had vambraces. It was an acquired item. If it was possible for kicks, then wasn&#x2019;t it possible for punches?

I took a few steps to the left and a wall appeared. If I walked a few steps to the right then there was another wall.
