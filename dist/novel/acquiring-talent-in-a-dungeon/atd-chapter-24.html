<p><span style="">Chapter 24 - &#xA0;Day 6, 6th Floor Closing</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p><p><span style="">[You are in a bleeding state. Health will decrease by 9 every minute.]</span></p><p><span style="">[Current Balance: 39/256]</span></p><p><span style="">The leeches had enzymes to prevent the clotting of blood. Blood constantly poured from the holes caused by the hairs. I moved my limbs and exited the stomach of the dead leech. The blood stopped flowing once the leech died, but the hairs were still stiff and weighed me down.</span></p><p><i><span style="">Puk!</span></i></p><p><span style="">Cold air touched my outstretched hands. My fingers touched the end of a stair. Lucky. In fact, I had been worried about the leech falling off the stairs. I took out my other arm, head, torso and legs and stepped on the stairs. I wiped off the sticky blood and mucus covering my eyes.</span></p><p><span style="">The first thing I saw was Yang Su-jin&#x2019;s head. Her neck hadn&#x2019;t grown yet, so it was just her head as she watched me with wide eyes. Her mouth that didn&#x2019;t have a voice, urgently mouthed something.</span></p><p><span style="">&apos;Front.&apos;</span></p><p><span style=""> I immediately formed a X with my arms. A kick from the front hit my guard.</span></p><p><span style="">[Bleeding - Anemia. Health will decrease by 9 every minute.]</span></p><p><span style="">[Current Balance: 19/256]</span></p><p><span style="">I was pushed back from the shock, but the carcass of the leech on the stairs became a cushion so I didn&#x2019;t receive any damage. I lowered my guard and looked at Kwak Yu-han.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;...&quot; He was looking at me with shock.</span></p><p><span style="">Don&#x2019;t make such an expression. If he was trying to kill someone, don&#x2019;t make a face that says &#x2018;I didn&#x2019;t want to betray you.&#x2019; I&#x2019;d rather accept an apology by eating him.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Hup!&quot; Kwak Yu-han became fired up and his arms swelled up like a gorilla. This was a technique. The attack started straight away. I wasn&#x2019;t even given time to drink a potion.</span></p><p><span style="">Despite his arms becoming swollen, his speed didn&#x2019;t seem to slow down at all as it moved through the air with a hissing sound. It was impossible for me to avoid it since the leech carcass was under my feet.</span></p><p><span style="">I read the trajectory of the arm flying towards me and caught it. It looked like both hands were clasped together. In a flash, the battle turned into a contest of power.</span></p><p><span style="">[Muscle strength: &#xA0;15]</span></p><p><span style="">Indeed, he was strong. It was a tight situation even with the strength obtained from Kim Ha-jong and amplified by Limiter Release. Kwak Yu-han&#x2019;s arm started to twitch. It was obvious that he couldn&#x2019;t maintain this technique for long.</span></p><p><span style="">Originally, I would hold on until the time ran out but...</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;...&#x201D; Kwak Yu-han quickly glanced at the top of my head. It was at my HP Bar that was still dwindling.</span></p><p><span style="">[Bleeding - Anemia. Health will decrease by 9 every minute.]</span></p><p><span style="">[Current Balance: 12/256]</span></p><p><span style="">This was a limitation for me so I had to make a decision. &#x201C;... I&#x2019;m sorry.&#x201D; He said those words. I immediately kicked his side.</span></p><p><i><span style="">Peok!</span></i></p><p><span style="">His body shook and the HP Bar decreased slightly. However, Kwak Yu-han stayed upright. He was able to withstand it. I repeated the kicks. One hit. Two hits. Three hits. After the fourth time, Kwak Yu-han&#x2019;s eyes finally shook. It wasn&#x2019;t because of the impact. He had finally noticed.</span></p><p><span style="">Something was increasing &#x2018;quickly.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Are you still sorry?&#x201D; I asked.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;...?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">[A bleeding state. Health will decrease by 9 every minute.]</span></p><p><span style="">[Current Balance: 32/256]</span></p><p><span style="">He shook due to the confusion. Thanks to this, I was able to kick his chin. Naturally, it reduced the HP by a lot more than kicking his side.</span></p><p><span style="">[Blood has been sucked according to the damage. 21 health has been recovered.]</span></p><p><span style="">I was receiving more health.</span></p><p><span style="">[Essence - Shadow Leech.]</span></p><p><span style="">[Absorbs 30% of the damage done to the opponent as HP.]</span></p><p><span style="">[Increases the amount of health reduced by &#x2018;bleeding&#x2019; by 50%. Bleeding duration and difficulty will increase by 100%.]</span></p><p><span style="">[The command &#x2018;Darkness Cloud&#x2019; consumes five health per second, allowing you to cover your field of view with a darkness that only you can see in.]</span></p><p><span style="">[50% increase to bleeding damage.]</span></p><p><span style="">[Once HP is below 20%, you will become &#x2018;anemic&#x2019; and all stats will reduce by 15%, in addition to the symptoms caused by a lack of blood.]</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;There is a shortage of blood.&#x201D; Kwak Yu-han stared at me with innocent and confused eyes. I raised my chin one more time. As he stared at me wide-eyed, the power in his arms was released.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I&apos;m sorry.&#x201D; I indifferently returned the apology that I received before.</span></p><p><i><span style="">Peok!</span></i> <i><span style="">Bam bam bam!</span></i></p><p><span style="">I punched his belly multiple times and he staggered. Kwak Yu-han&#x2019;s health fell to the bottom. Thanks to Blood-sucking, I recovered a lot of HP and was able to recover from the jaws of death.</span></p><p><span style="">[Cartography.

I looked at the top of the stairs. The three low ranking men and women were there.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;... Sob.&#x201D; There was a small cry. It was Yoon Ji-hee. She was being strangled when I emerged. The other two were already breathless.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hey.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hi... Hik.&#x201D; She closed her eyes and reacted as I stretched out a hand to her.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Hey, it&apos;s me.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Kyak!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">... Indeed, it was natural that she wouldn&#x2019;t feel relieved. My whole body was scarred and covered in blood and saliva. However, there was no time to let her intimidation die down. I grabbed Yoon Ji-hee&#x2019;s arm and dragged her up.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I-It hurts.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;If it hurts then stop blubbering and stand on your own.&#x201D; I turned back towards the bottom of the stairs.</span></p><p><span style="">Before I knew it, Yang Su-jin&#x2019;s upper body had been restored. She was turned towards this side and her eyes were asking &#x2018;is it over?&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Are you shy now?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;... What are you...? Don&#x2019;t look as much as you can. I am going to take off my clothes.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Then I turned her head without touching her neck. I quickly stripped off my clothes. If I thought about it, Yang Su-jin&#x2019;s body was covered but she was essentially naked. I didn&#x2019;t know if it was funny or creepy.</span></p><p><span style="">If I acted in this situation then I would be a real pervert. By the time I finished changing clothes, most of Yang Su-jin&#x2019;s body had regenerated.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;That is fast.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I can slow down my regeneration rate. I was in a decapitated state so there was no point in regenerating right away.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;... You should have regenerated when being stabbed earlier.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ah, I held my hand to be chest and still pretended to be hurt. Aren&#x2019;t I a genius?&#x201D; Was she really calling herself a genius?</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;That... Excuse me...&#x201D; Yoon Ji-hee approached me.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;That, can I go down first?&#x201D; The darkness of the leeches was lifted and they could see the peak that the staircase led to. The staircase to the seventh floor leading down from the peak was there.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What about the deal?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;That... Please tell me later... I can&#x2019;t stay here anymore...&#x201D; She showed a nauseous expression at the end of her words. There were dead bodies, blood and mucus strewn all over the place. I winced and nodded.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Then go down first and headed to the student union dining room tomorrow afternoon. 1 p.m. If you don&#x2019;t, I will kill you on the seventh floor.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I-I&#x2019;ll come. I will definitely come.&#x201D; She ran down the stairs as soon as she received permission. She gave a small scream as she stepped on the carcass of a leech and Yang Su-jin shook her head with disbelief.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Why is she still alive?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;There is a reason.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I heard you talking as you came down... Is she the daughter of a wealthy house?&#x201D; She was sharp.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;You heard that?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I was listening. Well... It is because I care.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;...&#x201D; I got goose bumps.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;If she doesn&#x2019;t give big money directly then... No, isn&#x2019;t it better to just kill her? I think that she will just be a burden.&#x201D; Yang Su-jin made a grumpy expression.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;When I was in the decapitated state, I looked at the weak people... They didn&#x2019;t even think of resisting. That woman will 100% be a cancer, a cancer.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;You might really get cancer as karma.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Fine, then she is a sweet potato?&#x201D; Yoon Ji-hee had disappeared down the staircase heading to the seventh floor. The stairs were still falling down so we should head down quickly&#x2026; I searched through the corpse of the leech.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;What are you looking for?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;...&#x201D; I found what I was looking for in the lower part of the body. I approached it and wielded my sword with all my strength. The firm, hard skin was torn and the thing inside was revealed.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;...&#x201D; I could hear Yang Su-jin sucking in a deep breath. Despite being beheaded, she was still capable of being shocked. Yoo Su-jeong was almost like a living corpse. Her eyes were staring blankly into the air and were discoloured like the pigment had been sucked out of it.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;...Ah...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Euh. Finish it quickly. I feel bad.&#x201D; Yang Su-jin spoke quickly as she gazed at Yoo Su-jeong. I grabbed Yang Su-jin&#x2019;s wrist.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Why? Just start eating. First...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;You eat her.&#x201D; Yang Su-jin&#x2019;s eyes widened. Just like last time when she received the essence of the goblins, she made a face like she couldn&#x2019;t believe it..</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;You are giving her to me? Really?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Didn&#x2019;t you say it? She is cancer.&#x201D; In order to continue the partnership in the future, Yang Su-jin should have more capabilities. There was no guarantee that she wouldn&#x2019;t be separated from me in between. &#xA0;Even though her method was brutal, Yoo Su-jeong was the &#x2018;woman&#x2019; who reached the third rank. It seemed appropriate to have Yang Su-jin eat her talents.</span></p><p><span style="">Well, she also helped and in the meantime, I wanted to continue making a good impression on her.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Oh yes!&quot; Yang Su-jin cheered and pulled out a bottle from the inventory. She looked back to see how long she had until the stairs would collapse and poured the bottle on Yoo Su-jeong&#x2019;s face.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ah... Euhhhhhhh!!!!&#x201D; An incredible scream emerged.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I don&#x2019;t remember that. Is it poison?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Nope. This is vinegar.&#x201D; Indeed, the smell was familiar.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;It looks like it hurts a lot... Oh, are you wondering why I am enjoying this? It is payback for stabbing me twice with the knife earlier.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I see.&#x201D; Well, as long as I wasn&#x2019;t the one receiving it... I waited silently.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;The stairs are almost collapsed.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yep.&#x201D; Yang Su-jin threw the empty bottle of vinegar away and kicked Yoo Su-jeong. Yoo Su-jeong&#x2019;s two daggers and some coins fell just as the staircase was about to collapse. It was a close call, but we arrived at the peak.</span></p><p><span style="">[6th floor clear.]</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p>
