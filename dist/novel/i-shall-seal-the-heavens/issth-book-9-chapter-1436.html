<p><strong></strong></p><p>[/expand]</p><p>At this critical moment in the fight, Meng Hao suddenly unleashed a fist strike!</p><p>It was none other than the Life-Extermination Fist!</p><p>One fist strike could not shake the air which held him tight, so Meng Hao unleashed the second fist strike, the Bedevilment Fist, and then the third, the God-Slaying Fist. Three punches were unleashed in quick succession, making one unified attack. As the power exploded out, he broke free from being locked in place and took a step forward.</p><p>In almost that exact moment, the air around him was ripped apart.</p><p>At the same time, an explosive power shot toward Meng Hao from behind. It was still... the power of Heaven Ripping!</p><p>Apparently that power wouldn&apos;t stop until Meng Hao was ripped to pieces!</p><p>Meng Hao evaded, but the Heaven Ripping power continued to close in on him. The air collapsed and shattered, and it almost seemed like Meng Hao would be incapable of escaping.</p><p>Down below, Shangguan Hong and everyone else gasped, sober expressions on their faces. It wasn&#x2019;t that they had never seen peak 9-Essences experts in action before. However, every time they did, they couldn&#x2019;t help but realize how weak they themselves were.</p><p>Seeing that Meng Hao had escaped once again, Jin Yunshan called out in a voice that brimmed with murderous intentions, &#x201C;Still not dead?!?!&#x201D;</p><p>His hands emanated boundless golden light as he once again made a ripping gesture.</p><p>Rumbling sounds surrounded Meng Hao, and a sensation of deadly crisis filled him. However, he felt no fear. In fact, that sensation of danger provoked something from within the legacy of Shui Dongliu.</p><p>&#x201C;The Three God-Slaying Fists aren&#x2019;t enough. I need... a fourth fist strike, and maybe even a fifth!!&#x201D; Countless thoughts buzzed in Meng Hao&#x2019;s mind, and at the same time, the flickering glow of augury could be seen in his eyes.</p><p>&#x201C;The first fist is Life-Extermination. The second fist is Self-Immolation. The third fist is God-Slaying. Well then, the fourth fist... should be Devil-Butchering!</p><p>&#x201C;Devils are like the dark night. The Devil-Butchering Fist is like a dispelling of the darkness!&#x201D; Meng Hao&#x2019;s breath came in ragged pants as he thought back to the divine ability the Sixth Paragon had unleashed. That combined with previous enlightenment from past years, as well as a magical technique from within Shui Dongliu&#x2019;s legacy. Gradually, the outline of an idea formed in his mind.</p><p>There was no time for lengthy contemplation. As the Heaven Ripping power built up around him, Meng Hao&#x2019;s right hand clenched tightly into a fist!</p><p>&#x201C;Fourth fist strike, Devil-Butchering!&#x201D; Meng Hao roared as he punched out. As the fourth fist strike was unleashed, his fist sent out black ripples which filled the area. Unexpectedly, it turned the entire area around him as black as night!</p><p>Then, within that pitch blackness, his fist began to shine with light!</p><p>It wasn&#x2019;t white light, but rather, red. It was as if nighttime had skin, and it was being ripped off to reveal the flesh and blood beneath. This was the fourth fist strike that Meng Hao had just now gained enlightenment of, the Devil-Butchering Fist!</p><p>It was not using dawn&#x2019;s light to dispel the darkness of night, rather it was skinning nighttime alive! This was true butchery!</p><p>Booming sounds rang out as the light spread outward. Everywhere it passed, the darkness of night was flayed in shocking fashion. It collapsed, and even Jin Yunshan&#x2019;s Heaven Ripping magic was completely destroyed. Meng Hao&#x2019;s fourth fist strike bore down on Jin Yunshan, and the golden light which had fed his power was also flayed!</p><p>Booms rang out as Jin Yunshan let out a miserable shriek. His hands were trembling, and blood oozed out of the corners of his mouth as he subconsciously backed up. When he looked up at Meng Hao, his eyes shone with disbelief.</p><p>&#x201C;What divine ability is that!?!?&#x201D; Astonishment gripped his heart. His Heaven Ripping ability was one of his trump cards, something that people normally could never break. In fact, this was the first time anything like this had ever happened!!</p><p>In the past, some people had powered their way through it, but this was someone breaking it on a fundamental level.</p><p>Even as Jin Yunshan fell back, Meng Hao emerged from the pitch black area, looking more than ever like he wanted to fight. His eyes glowed with red light as he strode forward, sending booms ringing out into the air.</p><p>&#x201C;You&#x2019;ve had your chance with your divine abilities. Now it&apos;s my turn.&#x201D; With that, he pointed his finger directly at Jin Yunshan, unleashing the Hexing magic of the League of Demon Sealers. It was none other than the Eighth Hex!</p><p>Instantly, space was locked down tight, causing Jin Yunshan&#x2019;s face to fall, and a sensation of imminent crisis to well up inside of him.</p><p>Jin Yunshan didn&#x2019;t hesitate for a moment. His eyes glowed brightly as he bit his tongue and spit out a mouthful of blood. As the blood flew through the air, it transformed into a blood-colored sealing mark, which flew up and landed on his forehead.</p><p>Rumbling could be heard as an aura appeared which could shake Heaven and Earth. As it exploded out from Jin Yunshan, it became countless bolts of lightning, each and every one of which were the color of gold!</p><p>These were golden lightning bolts from a Gold Tribulation!</p><p>At the same time, fluctuations began to emanate out from the ancient-looking blood-colored symbol. They were fluctuations which seemed to contain the passage of countless years of time, as though this symbol had existed before time even began. The fluctuations were so powerful that even the Vast Expanse outside of the necropolis began to tremble. At the same time, clouds began to descend.</p><p>Outside of the necropolis, clouds were building up; roiling, seething clouds that were simultaneously shrinking downward toward the necropolis.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, those clouds burst through whatever invisible barriers kept the necropolis hidden. Then, they appeared behind Jin Yunshan, where they began to converge into even more golden lightning bolts.</p><p>&#x201C;My ninth Essence is Vast Expanse Tribulation Lightning! I spent years gaining enlightenment of Tribulation Lightning, and even consumed the mist of the Vast Expanse to complete it. If I Transcend into the Daosource Realm, I can become the incarnation of the Vast Expanse&apos;s Tribulation Lightning. Then, all beings within the Vast Expanse will fear my Tribulation Lightning!&#x201D; Jin Yunshan threw his arms out wide as more and more Tribulation Lightning built up around him. At the same time, the aura of his ninth Essence roiled about!</p><p>Meng Hao&#x2019;s pupils constricted. He could sense how powerful this ninth Essence was, and could even tell that the lightning bolts had some vague will of their own!</p><p>He wasn&apos;t sure why, but an image popped up in his mind, something he had seen on the frescoes in the tunnel. He thought of... Allheaven destroying a world with his finger!</p><p>At this moment, Meng Hao realized that the aura of the lightning, although not completely identical to the aura of Allheaven&#x2019;s finger, was very similar!!</p><p>&#x201C;Tribulation Lightning strikes! Nine Essences fatality!!&#x201D; Jin Yunshan threw his head back and roared, throwing both hands up to point at Meng Hao. Instantly, the lightning formed from the Vast Expanse, his ninth Essence, roared forth. Countless lightning bolts converged, transforming into an enormous golden finger that could shake Heaven and Earth. Mists swirled around it as it shot toward Meng Hao.</p><p>Everything shook, and the sky went dark!</p><p><strong>Chapter 1436: Fourth Fist Strike: Devil-Butchering!</strong></p><p></p><hr><p></p>
