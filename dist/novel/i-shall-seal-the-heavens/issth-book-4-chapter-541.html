<p><strong>Chapter 541: Battle!</strong></p><p>After hearing Patriarch Huyan&#x2019;s words, Meng Hao&#x2019;s expression was the same as ever. That was his personality. The more he wanted to kill someone, the less he spoke. From the words Patriarch Huyan had spoken just now, it was obvious that he was well aware of what had actually happened.</p><p>&#x201C;What&#x2019;s the point in more talk?&#x201D; said Meng Hao coolly. &#x201C;You want to fight? Let&#x2019;s fight.&#x201D; As he spoke, he lifted up his right hand and made a snatching motion. Instantly, the black Devil Spear appeared in his hand. He hurled it out, causing a boom to ring out as the spear shot forward at an incredible speed.</p><p>As it screamed through the air, roaring sounds could be heard coming from the spear as boundless black mist appeared. Within the mist were innumerable vicious faces. Their bloodthirsty smiles were filled with greed.</p><p>In some indistinct way, the mist actually seemed to be forming into an enormous head. It was the head&#x2026; of the Devil Construct!</p><p>The Devil Spear had now completely unleashed the explosive power of Demon Weapon Lonelytomb&#x2019;s Devil Construct. It shot through the air with a droning sound.</p><p>The spear had nothing to do with Meng Hao&#x2019;s Cultivation base. Its mightiness was completely self-contained. However, it was still nothing but a strand of a Devil Construct that couldn&#x2019;t even compare to the real Demon Weapon Lonelytomb.</p><p>Even still, when the Devil Spear exploded out, it was powerful enough to slay any Nascent Soul Cultivator. As for Spirit Severing&#x2026; Meng Hao wasn&#x2019;t sure. Therefore, he had decided to test it out.</p><p>&#x201C;Area,&#x201D; said Patriarch Huyan, his voice calm and his expression unchanging. He lifted his right hand and then gestured forward. Instantly, everything within three hundred meters turned into his own Area world!</p><p>This divine ability was little different than natural law. It was a magical ability belonging to the Spirit Severing stage. The Area was not large, only three hundred meters. A three hundred meter Area which was a world only his own. Within that world, Patriarch Huyan had ultimate power. No divine abilities or magical techniques would be capable of breaking open the Area to harm him in any way.</p><p>This is what sets Spirit Severing completely above Nascent Soul. In the Spirit Severing stage, divine abilities become natural laws!</p><p>Nothing within the three hundred meter Area seemed unusual. However, in that instant, Meng Hao could sense that Patriarch Huyan had turned the space surrounding him into his own world.</p><p>A boom could be heard. As soon as the Devil Spear entered the three hundred meter region, it was defeated and transformed into a black mist. The mist spread out as if it were trying to infect the area, but Meng Hao could tell that it was actually fighting back against the world around it.</p><p>Such formidableness, such usage of natural law, was the first time that Meng Hao personally experienced the mightiness of Spirit Severing. Patriarch Reliance ran away without fighting. At Holy Snow City, he had been fused with the Agarwood legacy.</p><p>Outside of Blackgate Fort, Zhixiang had stepped in.</p><p>This was the first time Meng Hao was truly facing up against a Spirit Severing expert.</p><p>&#x201C;Childish,&#x201D; said Patriarch Huyan. He moved forward, causing the sense of pressure to grow even more intense. He didn&#x2019;t even attack; he simply advanced. As he did, the three hundred meter Space went along with him. The mist that was the Devil Spear seemed to be completely suppressed by the world around it. Popping sounds could be heard from inside as it shrank down on itself. The countless faces sucked inward, transforming into the head of the Devil Construct.</p><p>The expression on its face was one of unprecedented seriousness. Underneath the suppressive pressure, it began to howl. It then started to back up, dissipating the entire time, as if it were on the verge of being destroyed. Patriarch Huyan neared it, and it was at this moment that the Devil Construct exploded into action. Suddenly, Demonic Qi began to shot toward it from all directions, transforming into ripples that fought against the Area world and enabled the Devil Construct to successfully escape.</p><p>It fled, surrounding by roaring sounds, to return to Meng Hao. The black mist was now extremely faint, as if it were on the verge of dissipating completely. Meng Hao collected it up grimly. As of this point, Patriarch Huyan was about three hundred meters away from Meng Hao.</p><p>Meng Hao backed up. Even at this distance of three hundred meters, he could clearly sense the fearsomeness of a Spirit Severing expert.</p><p>&#x201C;There&#x2019;s no need to feel resentment,&#x201D; Patriarch Huyan said calmly as he looked at Meng Hao. &#x201C;I understand how Karma works. If you want to blame something, blame your own bad fortune.&#x201D;</p><p>At this moment, the mastiff lifted its head up and howled, the sound of which caused everything to shake. Suddenly, power exploded out, revealing its Spirit Severing aura.</p><p>As soon as the aura appeared, Patriarch Huyan&#x2019;s pupils constricted. He looked over at the mastiff with a serious look.</p><p>At the same time, a bloody glow began to shine out from the mastiff&#x2019;s eyes. It suddenly shot forward, entering into Patriarch Huyan&#x2019;s three hundred meter Area. As soon as it entered, the Area began to distort.</p><p>It roared again, causing red-colored ripples to emanate out from its body. They spread out in all directions, coming into contact with Patriarch Huyan&#x2019;s Area. Patriarch Huyan&#x2019;s face went pale, as if all the blood in his body were suddenly flowing in reverse.</p><p>A fierce glow shone up from his eyes. This entire time, he had been moving forward, but now, he stopped.</p><p>He gave the mastiff a closer look and then slowly said, &#x201C;One moment of contact, and it cost me ten percent of my Essence Blood. This Immortal Beast isn&#x2019;t bad at all. It clearly has gained enlightenment from a Spirit Severing legacy, but isn&#x2019;t of Spirit Severing itself. Still... such a will of undeath is truly rare.&#x201D;</p><p>A tremor ran through the mastiff&#x2019;s body as it was suddenly pushed back several paces. It let out a threatening growl as it stared fixedly at Patriarch Huyan.</p><p>The Blood Mastiff&#x2019;s Domain was exactly as Patriarch Huyan had said. It was acquired via a legacy, and had not been gained from personal enlightenment. However, the legacy Domain of the Blood Immortal was no trivial matter; it was a will of undeath!</p><p>The First Severing had been a Severing of blood! All the blood in the body, Severed!</p><p>Blood represents life. Therefore, Severing blood is equivalent to severing life! Life without death is&#x2026; undeath!</p><p>Therefore, this Domain of undeath could affect natural laws, and create a world in which blood was prohibited!</p><p>Almost in the same moment in which the invisible struggle between the Blood Mastiff and Patriarch Huyan unfolded, Meng Hao&#x2019;s eyes glittered. Having tested out Patriarch Huyan&#x2019;s strength, he was now able to form somewhat of an image in his mind, clarifying the differences between himself and Spirit Severing.</p><p>&#x201C;I&#x2026; CAN fight it!&#x201D; He strode forward two paces. With those two steps, roaring filled his body as he entered the Second Anima. The power of two great circle Nascent Souls exploded out in his body.</p><p>His aura radiated out like a whirlwind. His body grew taller and more intrepid. He took a third step, and instantly, entered the Third Anima of his Seven Animas Soul Transformations. The combination of three Nascent Souls caused his body to explode with battle prowess equivalent to four great circle Nascent Souls. He grew taller and even more powerful.</p><p>&#x201C;Even if you do possess some temporary way to magically power up,&#x201D; said Patriarch Huyan coolly, &#x201C;it is still&#x2026; thinking far too much of yourself!&#x201D; He waved his sleeve, causing the three hundred meter Area to distort in ripples toward the mastiff. The mastiff let out a growling roar as bloody light exploded up from its body. It also manifested an Area world to fight back, although it was only about 250 meters.</p><p>Battles of Spirit Severing were different from those of Nascent Soul Cultivators. All Spirit Severing Cultivators have Area worlds. Without breaking the Area world, the Spirit Severing Cultivator is incapable of being harmed.</p><p>Between the Mastiff and Patriarch Huyan, the Area worlds opposed each other. Meng Hao&#x2019;s wind whipped about, and his aura shot up. He took a fourth step forward.</p><p>Four Nascent Souls combined. Popping sounds rang out in waves as Meng Hao&#x2019;s body grew even taller and stronger. The aura of a scholar was now gone, replaced instead by the evil sense of an Immortal Devil. The battle prowess of eight full circle Nascent Souls exploded out.</p><p>Such battle prowess, such energy, caused the wind in the area to scream into a vortex that swirled around Meng Hao. His clothes danced in the wind, and his eyes shone with a blinding light. At this point, even Patriarch Huyan couldn&#x2019;t help but be visibly affected by such power.</p><p>Patriarch Huyan had never encountered another great circle Nascent Soul Cultivator as powerful or shocking as Meng Hao. Such fearsome strength would enable him to sweep across the entire Nascent Soul stage.</p><p>&#x201C;You have an excellent temporary power up magic&#x2026;.&#x201D; said thoughtfully, his eyes narrowing.</p><p>It was at this point that Meng Hao took a fifth step, his eyes fixed dead on Patriarch Huyan. As of this point, he had now entered Patriarch Huyan&#x2019;s three hundred meter Area.</p><p>The instant it happened, Meng Hao felt an incredible sense of pressure weighing down on him from the Area world. It felt like a mountain had suddenly been dropped onto his body, to crush it into a pulp. As soon as that incredible pressure weighed down on him, however, Meng Hao&#x2019;s body emitted a roar as five colors united and he entered the Fifth Anima!</p><p>With the Fifth Anima came sixteen times the battle prowess of a great circle Nascent Soul. Such explosive power fought back against the enormous pressure exerted by the three hundred meter Area, causing distortions to ripple out.</p><p>The sight of it made Patriarch Huyan to feel thorough astonishment.</p><p>The three hundred meter Area was something that would make the heads of any Nascent Soul Cultivator bow, even one of the great circle. All Patriarch Huyan would have to do is exercise a thought, and that person would be crushed into pieces.</p><p>Meng Hao, however, was using some astonishing technique to make himself terrifyingly powerful and fight back against his three hundred meter Area.</p><p>&#x201C;I can&#x2019;t let him live,&#x201D; thought Patriarch Huyan. &#x201C;He&#x2019;s only at the great circle of the Nascent Soul stage, and already has such terrifying power. If he ever Severs his Spirit&#x2026;.&#x201D;</p><p>It was the first time he seemed to be taking the situation seriously. His killing intent grew, and he let out a cold harrumph. He immediately took a portion of the three hundred meter Area which was resisting the Blood Mastiff, and sent it crushing down onto Meng Hao.</p><p>&#x201C;You&#x2019;ll be reaching your limit any second now, won&#x2019;t you!? In front of Spirit Severing&#x2026; it doesn&#x2019;t matter how powerful your Nascent Soul, you&#x2019;re nothing but an insect!&#x201D;</p><p>Even as Patriarch Huyan sent the Area pressure bearing down onto Meng Hao, Meng Hao set his jaw. A tremor ran through his body, and his eyes shone with a cold, fierce light.</p><p>&#x201C;Sixth Anima!&#x201D;</p><p>Boom!</p><p>Six colors combined. Meng Hao grew taller, and looked just like an Immortal Devil. An indescribably aura of valiance skyrocketed up. He now possessed a Cultivation base equivalent to thirty-two great circle Nascent Souls. This was a level of Nascent Soul power that had never been seen before in the Cultivation world!</p><p>-----</p><p><em>This chapter was sponsored by David Tang, Devon Silva, Von Neuman and Anonymous</em></p>
