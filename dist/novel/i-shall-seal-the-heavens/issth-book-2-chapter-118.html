<p><strong>Chapter 118: Without Entering Mount Heaven, Immortal Ascension is Impossible</strong></p><p>Meng Hao looked calmly at Chu Yuyan and took a few steps back. He had begun studying Confucianism and Daoism at a young age. Despite the incredible changes he had experienced, those teachings still existed in his heart. It&apos;s not that he was incapable of taking advantage of someone in trouble, but when it came to morality, he had a bottom line. He wouldn&apos;t touch Chu Yuyan.</p><p>She was his enemy, not his friend. Punishing her was one thing, but to sink to such a level of depravity would go against his very being. He might not be a complete gentleman, but he wasn&apos;t a depraved scumbag.</p><p>There were some things that he would never do. Everyone has a bottom line. To Meng Hao, it was about principles, and morality.</p><p>He thought again about the Perfect Foundation Pill. He settled his Qi and calmed his mind, then stepped onto a flying sword and flew up into the air.</p><p>Enough time passed for an incense stick to burn. Everything around Chu Yuyan was quiet. She was finally unconscious, her aura feeble, as if she were suffering from some serious illness.</p><p>Meng Hao returned. When he landed onto the ground, he looked at Chu Yuyan and let out a soft sigh. Producing another set of clothing from his bag of the Cosmos, he covered her, and then sat down cross-legged nearby.</p><p>Time slowly passed. Four hours went by before Chu Yuyan&apos;s eyes opened. As soon as they did, they filled with confusion. Then they flashed as she seemed to remember something. She sat there silently.</p><p>She didn&apos;t yell or flip out. Instead, she silently walked into the cave. Some time passed, and she came back out, her clothes back in order. Her face was pale, and she looked very weak and tired. She gave Meng Hao a look filled with complexity.</p><p>She hadn&apos;t lost her memory. It was quite the opposite, in fact. She very clearly remembered every single thing that had happened, including Meng Hao flying off into the sky.</p><p>Meng Hao&apos;s eyes opened, and he gave her a level look. &quot;I did nothing to harm you,&quot; he said slowly. &quot;That medicinal pill was a punishment for your attempt to harm my Cultivation base. You need to understand the truth of the situation here. My instructions, are everything.&quot;</p><p>There was no arrogance left in Chu Yuyan. Her feelings regarding Meng Hao were incredibly complex.</p><p>Yes, she hated him. But under the circumstances just now, he had chosen to leave rather than touch her. Chu Yuyan didn&#x2019;t want to, but she actually felt appreciation mixed together with her hatred. The complex feelings within her felt like floodwaters threatening to submerge her.</p><p>She didn&apos;t know how many similar medicinal pills Meng Hao had, but from his actions, she could guess that even though the pill she was concocting was important to him, he wasn&apos;t worried about her trying to poison him by adding or changing the recipe.</p><p>&quot;The pill formula he gave me is very strange. Because of the interactions between the various ingredients, to change the formula ratios is simply beyond my ability. I wouldn&#x2019;t be able to produce a complete pill.&#x2026;</p><p>&#x201C;However, even if I did successfully adjust the formula, given this guy&apos;s personality, it&#x2019;s possible he might make me consume it&#x2026;. Actually, it&#x2019;s impossible at all to tell if he will even consume it himself. Maybe he&apos;ll catch a viper and force it to consume it.</p><p>&quot;In fact, it&apos;s even possible... that the pill doesn&apos;t need to be consumed. Maybe he&apos;ll use some other method to melt it and provoke the lightning. Maybe that&apos;s why he doesn&apos;t care.&quot; She frowned. It was really impossible to figure out the answer, and she had no idea what to do. She looked at Meng Hao, her expression torn. The more she thought about him and the deepness of his schemes, the more frightened she became.</p><p>&quot;Compared to him, Wang Tengfei really is inferior.&quot; She sighed. After thinking for a moment, she took a deep breath and said. &quot;That skull has been here for several tens of thousands of years. Actually... I know where we are, and I know what this place is. When I saw the altar in the lake of blood, I started to suspect. I&apos;ve thought about it a lot since then, and finally realized where we are.&#x201D;</p><p>Her voice soft, she continued, &quot;This is one of the two undiscovered locations of the Legacy of the Blood Immortal. In total, there are nine. From ancient times until now, seven have appeared. This means there have been a total of seven chances throughout history to acquire the Legacy. Whenever a new location appears, it sets the entire Southern Domain abuzz. There are rules governing this place. Only Foundation Establishment Cultivators can enter. Any who does, has a chance at acquiring the Legacy.</p><p>&quot;Every time the tournament begins, the previously discovered Legacy zones will emit a glow of blood that lasts for nine days. After nine days have passed, whoever is the first person to enter into the red glow, as long as they meet the requirement of having a Cultivation base at the Foundation Establishment stage, will be transported to the Blood Immortal&apos;s Mountain.</p><p>&quot;When the Legacy tournament begins, it will last for a maximum of nine months. Only one person is permitted into each Legacy zone. From tens of thousands of years ago when the first Blood Immortal Legacy zone appeared, all the way until now, there have been seven. This means that there have been seven Legacy tournaments. Some people have had the luck to acquire various rewards, but down to this day, no one has succeeded in acquiring the true Legacy.</p><p>&quot;Of the nine total Legacy zones, there are two remaining. Throughout all these years, no one has discovered their location. Therefore, there has been no way to begin the eighth Legacy tournament.&quot;</p><p>As he heard all of these things, Meng Hao&#x2019;s eyes began to narrow. &quot;Who is the Blood Immortal?&quot; he asked.</p><p>&quot;I refuse to believe you didn&apos;t go yourself to examine the lake of blood,&#x201D; she said calmly. &#x201C;And I also refuse to believe you are unaware that underneath the surface of the lake is a massive head with an open mouth. The seven other Blood Immortal Legacy zones throughout the world all have lakes of blood and altars. Underneath each altar is a mouth. Furthermore, I refuse to believe you didn&apos;t hear the voice of the Legacy. I have no proof, but my intuition tells me that you&#x2019;ve been there, and you know. You&#x2019;re a cautious person, so you didn&#x2019;t dare to step foot inside without first bringing back those skulls to analyze, to see if you could determine their age.&#x201D;</p><p>&quot;You didn&apos;t answer my question.&quot;</p><p>&quot;The Ancient Temple of Doom. It was once a holy place for the Ancient Doom Clan. They were not looked upon with favor by the Heavens, and were punished with tribulation. There were three famous Immortals amongst them whose names were passed down through the generations after. One of them was the Blood Immortal.</p><p>&#x201C;Anyone who acquires his legacy will be qualified to fight on the path to Immortality, and step foot onto the Immortality Pillar.&#x201D; Chu Yuyan&#x2019;s voice was soft as she spoke. She continued.</p><p>&quot;The path to Immortality is an arduous one. According to the ancient legends, it can be found only on Mount Heaven. It is not a mountain on the earth, but in the sky. On its peak is an Immortality Pillar. By stepping onto the pillar and knocking on the door of South Heaven, an Immortal realm shall be opened. You shall be bathed in the light of Immortality. Step into the void, and into Immortal Ascension.</p><p>&#x201C;Since ancient times, countless heroes have fought over the ability to tread the path to Immortal Ascension. After all, if you analyze the character &#x2018;Immortal (&#x4ED9;)&#x2019;, you will find that it is composed of the character &#x2018;person (&#x4EBA;)&#x2019; and the character &#x2018;mountain (&#x5C71;)&#x2019;. That mountain is Mount Heaven, and the person... is only one person!</p><p>&quot;Ever ten thousand years, one person achieves Immortal Ascension!</p><p>&#x201C;However, there is another understanding regarding the character &#x2018;Immortal (&#x4ED9;)&#x2019;. According to this understanding, first is the character &#x2018;enter (&#x5165;),&#x2019; then is the character &#x2018;mountain (&#x5C71;)&#x2019;. Combined, they mean Immortal. It is a simple truth. Without entering Mount Heaven, one cannot achieve Immortal Ascension!&quot; She looked at Meng Hao, explaining things that were only known to members of the five great Sects and three great Clans in the Southern Domain.</p><p>What is Immortality? A person and a mountain!</p><p>What is Immortality? Entering the mountain!</p><p>In ten thousand years, one person entered the mountain, one person achieved Immortal Ascension!</p><p>Meng Hao&apos;s eyes began to shine brightly, but then, just as quickly, the glow faded. Considering that he was just a Foundation Establishment Cultivator, Immortal Ascension was far, far away for him. For him to think about it now was really just too extravagant; it was basically a daydream.</p><p>&quot;Before the path to Immortality are the Dao Seeking Stones, which only exist in the three Danger Zones. Dao Seeking is difficult, but before that is Spirit Severing and its three Severings. Each Severings requires enlightenment, and gives life. To be honest, I don&apos;t really know what all of this means. But when I was young, my father would speak these words to me and tell me to place them within my heart, and never forget them for the rest of my life.&quot; Chu Yuyan played with her hair, no longer looking at Meng Hao. She walked back to the pill furnace and slowly sat down. Taking out the jade slip with the information about the pill formula, she closed her eyes and began to analyze it.</p><p>Everything grew quiet.</p><p>Meng Hao looked at Chu Yuyan. She was different now. Her words continued to echo in his heart, and he analyzed them bit by bit. Based on the look on her face, as well as his own speculations regarding the Legacy of the Blood Immortal, he was now seventy to eighty percent sure that what she had said was the truth.</p><p>After some time passed, he spoke. &quot;Why did you give me so much detailed information?&#x201D;</p><p>&quot;Because,&quot; she said softly, looking at him, &quot;I hope that you will go after the Blood Immortal&apos;s Legacy and then... die inside. Then I can finally be rid of you. Many things have happened that shouldn&apos;t have.&quot; Having said this, she closed her eyes and continued to seek enlightenment regarding the pill formula.</p><p>Meng Hao suddenly laughed. He didn&apos;t mind hearing her words. If she hadn&apos;t spoken just now, then he would have grown suspicious. After all this time spent with Chu Yuyan, he was starting to understand her personality much better.</p><p>&quot;The Legacy of the Blood Immortal. I wonder if I should go in after it...&quot; he thought, his eyes flickering. It would be impossible for him to not be a bit tempted. A Legacy which could send waves throughout the entire Southern Domain. Anything related to the word &apos;Immortal&apos; would drive Cultivators crazy.</p>
