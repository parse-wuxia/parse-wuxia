<p><strong>Chapter 1380: Three Scriptures Seal the Almighty!</strong></p><p>&#x201C;We didn&#x2019;t take action before, and even when you first made your appearance we only focused on defense!&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Today, we three will repay our debt to the Mountain and Sea Realm!&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Three Scriptures Seal the Almighty!&#x201D; These three Doyens were extremely mysterious figures. For countless years, they had never made a single appearance. The scriptures they cultivated had been disseminated in the world, but had not actually been created by these individuals. The Doyens were merely the guardians of the scriptures.</p><p>The three old men sat down cross-legged and closed their eyes, whereupon the magical symbols of the scriptures began to swirl around them and form a sealing mark!</p><p>They planned to use the power of their scriptures to seal this female Paragon!</p><p>&#x201C;We shall sacrifice our longevity to power the three classic scriptures and seal you. It will not be an eternal seal, but it will last long enough to alter the state of this battle!&#x201D;</p><p>The 8-Essences Paragon frowned and waved her right index finger. However, she was incapable of breaking open the sealing mark. Meanwhile, Paragon Sea Dream and the Paragon puppet burst back onto the battlefield, using their Paragon power to completely change the state of the battle.</p><p>&#x201C;You really think you can change the tide of battle like this?&#x201D; the 8-Essences Paragon said with a laugh. Even as her laughter rang out, a seemingly unremarkable Outsider inside the army suddenly began to tremble, then looked up and screamed. Then, his body began to swell, and unexpectedly, he began to absorb numerous surrounding Outsiders. Within the space of a few breaths of time, he had transformed into a huge ball of flesh fully 3,000 meters across, which hovered there in the starry sky.</p><p>That ball of flesh actually had facial features, and if you looked closely, it resembled a head. When the eyes opened, they glowed with coldness. At the same time, laughter rang out.</p><p>&#x201C;Interesting. It seems that I need to make an appearance after all.&#x201D; The ball of flesh then rapidly shrank down into the shape of a person.</p><p>It was a middle-aged man wearing a long red robe. He was very odd-looking, with an extremely large head that seemed disproportionate to his body. A twisted smile could be seen on his face, and a murderous aura sprang out as he took a step forward toward Sea Dream and the Paragon puppet.</p><p>As he appeared in front of them, Paragon Sea Dream&#x2019;s face fell, as did the faces of all the other powerful experts. Even the three great Doyens&#x2019; eyes widened.</p><p>&#x201C;This aura.... You&#x2019;re not cultivators of the 33 Heavens. You&apos;re from... those other two powers!!&#x201D;</p><p>At this point, more than ten other Outsiders within the huge army began to roar, grow in size, and absorb nearby Outsiders. Soon, more than ten powerful experts had appeared on the battlefield.</p><p>Although their cultivation base fluctuations didn&#x2019;t put them at the Paragon level, based on their battle prowess, they were equivalent to Imperial Lords. As soon as they appeared, they began to laugh as they charged toward the Mountain and Sea Realm cultivators.</p><p>Their auras were very strange. Clearly, they weren&#x2019;t Mountain and Sea cultivators, nor were they cultivators from the 33 Heavens. There was even a force of expulsion pushing against them, although it was incapable of actually driving them out!</p><p>That was because they had not come as their true selves, but instead, had used their souls to perform a sort of possession, and thus force their way in.</p><p>Shockingly, one of these new arrivals possessed one of the giants, who suddenly grew far larger than before. Throwing his head back and howling, he charged forth into battle; as he did, the stars on his forehead began to spin, causing an intense murderous aura to flare up.</p><p>In the briefest of moments, the Mountain and Sea Realm once again began to suffer heavy losses.</p><p>The Seventh Sea was no more, and the Seventh Mountain... was being besieged by millions upon millions of Outsiders. It didn&#x2019;t take long before that same mountain began to collapse into pieces. Once again, the battle was completely out of balance.</p><p>As of this moment, there were only two Seas and two Mountains left in the entire Realm!</p><p>It was a moment of grave crisis, and seemingly impending destruction. Millions upon millions of Outsiders were now under the leadership of numerous powerful experts, who led them into the Eighth Sea. However, it was at that point that a light arrow suddenly shot out from the Eighth Mountain, which almost instantly appeared in front of the giant with the stars on his forehead.</p><p>Roaring, the giant clenched his right hand into a fist and punched out at the arrow.</p><p>A huge boom echoed out as the light arrow shattered. However, the giant let out a muffled groan as he staggered backward. Simultaneously, his right arm exploded, and much of his body was severely damaged. Blood sprayed out of his mouth even as a second light arrow closed in. However, that arrow didn&#x2019;t slam into the giant, but rather, the Eighth Sea itself!</p><p>The Eighth Sea had long since been laced with restrictive spells, which were now activated by that light arrow, causing the entire Sea to begin to roar. Countless rings of light appeared on the surface of the water, which rose up and then exploded in shocking fashion.</p><p>Instantly, miserable shrieks began to ring out as countless Outsiders were shredded to pieces by the explosive restrictive spells.</p><p>Of course, those deaths didn&#x2019;t count much when compared to the size of the Outsider army as a whole, and couldn&#x2019;t even be called a serious blow. The effect on their morale was significant though.</p><p>&#x201C;Who are you?!?!&#x201D; bellowed the armless, seriously injured giant, throwing his head back and roaring. All of the other powerful experts who had recently appeared also turned to stare at the Eighth Mountain.</p><p>There, a bright light appeared, which shot out from the Eighth Mountain at top speed toward the battlefield.</p><p>It was none other than Meng Hao!</p><p>Shockingly, he was followed by scores of Outsider beasts. It was impossible to determine how, but he had somehow incited them to follow his orders. Roaring, they shot toward the battlefield with vicious expressions on their faces.</p><p>The tide of battle was constantly shifting in numerous unexpected ways. Of the two 8-Essences Paragons, one had begun to fight Shui Dongliu, after which the two of them had vanished. As for the other, she was temporarily sealed in place by the three Doyens.</p><p>Paragon Sea Dream and the Paragon puppet were currently fighting a desperate battle with the large-headed cultivator.</p><p>Meng Hao&#x2019;s appearance on the scene changed things once again. He stopped the advance of the Outsider army, and yet simultaneously, was now facing the charge of the more than ten recently arrived powerful experts, some of whom were giants.</p><p>As Meng Hao began to fight them, the army itself once again began to march into the Eighth Sea. Before long, the sea itself was vanquished, and the army proceed onward toward the Eighth Mountain.</p><p>It was at this point that a light sigh suddenly rang out, and someone flew out from the Ninth Mountain and Sea to appear in front of the Outsider army. Shockingly, behind this person could be seen an illusory world, almost as if he had come from within that world itself.</p><p>&#x201C;I&apos;ve come to help, little brother,&#x201D; said an ancient voice, filled with warmth and kindness. This person was a young man, whose expression was that of extreme loneliness. It was as if he should never have appeared in this day and age, and yet, here he was.</p><p>It was none other than... Ke Jiusi!!</p><p>He had come from the Ancient Demon Immortal Sect, which had long since faded away into history, to appear on this battlefield. As soon as he appeared, another sigh could be heard from the illusory world behind him. That sigh came from... true spirit Night!</p><p>As the sigh echoed out, Night apparently opened his eyes within that illusory world. In that very instant, fully a million Outsiders suddenly vanished. When they reappeared, they were in an era of time that no one could see. They were back in the Ancient Demon Immortal Sect, during its most flourishing and golden era. Instantly, fighting broke out!!</p><p>Ke Jiusi was not the only person to appear at this critical moment in the battle. A Daoist couple suddenly flew out from the Ninth Mountain and Sea. Behind the woman were countless cultivators who had blank expressions on their faces, and yet seemed filled with madness and insanity. As for the man, every step he took caused freezing ice to spread out through the starry sky. It was as if he was walking upon frost soil!</p><p>These two were none other than... Frost Soil Demon Emperor Han Shan and his wife!!</p><p>&#x201C;Meng Hao, young friend, I&#x2019;ve come.&#x201D; Han Shan&#x2019;s appearance on the scene caused ice to spread throughout all Heaven and Earth.</p><p>Although his cultivation base was not very high, his debut filled the cultivators of the Mountain and Sea Realm with a new desire to fight, with new braveness. After Han Shan, Lord Ji appeared, as did Grandpa Meng.</p><p>Then came the experts of the Fang Clan.</p><p>All of the various sects from the Ninth Mountain and Sea joined in. Meng Hao even saw Fatty. Although he was obviously frightened, he instantly flew into battle with the Outsiders. And then there was Meng Hao&#x2019;s Master... Pill Demon, who also began to fight in this final battle with the Outsiders.</p><p>There were many familiar faces who all came to the Eighth Mountain to fight....</p><p>The Eighth Mountain was the battlefield, and it was filled with Outsiders and Mountain and Sea cultivators. Bitter and deadly fighting caused rumbling explosions to echo out constantly. Faced against such an endless sea of Outsiders, everyone put everything on the line to fight.</p><p>Meng Hao was shaken, but there was no time to ponder his apprehensions. He was incapable of going to personally help the people that he knew, and was instead forced to fight these powerful experts who were clearly not from the 33 Heavens. Their divine abilities and techniques were things that he had never seen before.</p><p>That was especially true of the giants, whose formidable fleshly body power was absolutely terrifying.</p><p>Booms rang out, and people were dying left and right. Meng Hao&#x2019;s eyes were bloodshot as he called upon the full level of his cultivation base to levy one deadly attack after another. He used the Mountain Consuming Incantation to summon numerous mountains, and he transformed into an azure roc, with infinitely sharp talons.</p><p>The Blood Demon appeared, roaring, and the Paragon Bridge descended to crush all. Meng Hao was almost like a phantom who flickered back and forth to fight more than ten enemies at once.</p><p>A boom rang out as one of the giants coughed up blood. A look of disbelief could be seen on his face as his chest caved in under one of Meng Hao&apos;s fist strikes. His heart was shattered, and blood sprayed out everywhere, completely soaking Meng Hao.</p><p>&#x201C;God blood? Not very pure, but good nonetheless.&#x201D; Sensing the extraordinary nature of the God blood, Meng Hao flickered into motion, once again leaping into the fighting. Spitting some blood out of his mouth, he faced off against the dozen or so enemies and then began to laugh heartily. Waving his hand, he summoned the copper mirror, which transformed into the Battle Weapon. Then the meat jelly flew out and became a suit of armor.</p><p>&#x201C;Alright, bring it on!&#x201D; Meng Hao roared, laughing madly, a ferocious expression on his face. His friends and family were all fighting bitterly, how could he not stand by their side!?</p><p>Off in the distance, the Three Great Daoist Societies were fighting with all the power they could muster. The boom of self-detonation occasionally rang out, as the Mountain and Sea Realm fought with utter madness. By now, they had fought the Outsider army to a standstill, and were no longer suffering successive defeats.</p><p>The Outsiders were finally facing the true madness of the Mountain and Sea Realm!</p><p>Suddenly, a voice rang out from the collapsed ruins of the Sixth Mountain. &#x201C;This is all useless. This time, you people will be completely wiped out!&#x201D;</p><p>It was none other than the female Paragon. By now, the three Doyens who surrounded her were withering away into skin and bones. However, they still held on. It was at this point that their disciples flew toward them, sitting down behind them cross-legged to support them with their own longevity!</p><p>&#x201C;How long can you keep me pinned down?&#x201D; the Paragon asked. &#x201C;Your three classic scriptures are extraordinary. Paramount Daoist scriptures from the Paragon Immortal Realm. Unfortunately, your cultivation bases are not at the Paragon level. Therefore, how could you possibly keep me sealed for any length of time? In fact, are you even capable of holding on right now? The moment that I&apos;m free, is the moment that the Mountain and Sea Realm... will face complete and utter destruction!&#x201D;</p><p></p><hr><p></p>
