It was a flame gifted to him by his Master Pill Demon, for use in pill concocting. He had observed the flame for quite some time that year, and had eventually fused the seed of the flame with his Core. After igniting it fully, it became an everburning fire inside of him.</p><p>When he finally became convinced to tread the path of the Five-Colored Nascent Soul, it didn&#x2019;t seem to have anything to do with the Everburning Flame. Meng Hao hadn&#x2019;t thought much about it. Meng Hao had assumed that in his pursuit of the five elements, he would need to find different types of totems. However&#x2026; in the blink of an eye, this flame suddenly exploded out, causing Meng Hao to be completely shaken mentally.</p><p>He suddenly realized that he had made a mistake. The Five-Colored path, and the attributes of the five elements, weren&#x2019;t necessarily limited to totems. Any blessing in Heaven and Earth had the possibility of becoming part of his Five-Colored path.</p><p>The Everburning Flame, drawn out by the power of the Joss Flame, and because of his two great totems of Metal and Wood, burned out in all directions. It melted the air itself as it raged around Meng Hao.</p><p>Suddenly, the character for fire appeared near his dantian region. The instant it appeared, the flames around him rose up into the sky. Suddenly, the Fire-type totem seed given to him by the five Crow Divinity Tribes flew out from from within his bag of holding. The tiny tongue of flame had already dissipated by more than half by now. Meng Hao instantly began to rotate the Everburning Flame, causing it to envelop the tiny seed and then assimilate it.</p><p>The moment Meng Hao absorbed the Fire-type totem seed, the Crow Flame Tribe members all looked at him, trembling.</p><p>The Fire-type totem tattoos that had been disappearing from their bodies moments ago, were suddenly changed! Now, they looked exactly like Meng Hao&#x2019;s Fire character!</p><p>Immediately, Joss Flame power shot out from their bodies toward Meng Hao.</p><p>The Crow Flame Tribe members were shaking with excitement. Their voices came out in loud shouts as they dropped to their knees to kowtow to Meng Hao.</p><p>&#x201C;Sacred Ancient!&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Greetings, Sacred Ancient!!&#x201D;</p><p>Meng Hao&#x2019;s entire body was filled with roaring sound. His aura was shocking as his body floated there in mid-air. The Joss Flame power from the more than 1,000 members of the Crow Scout, Crow Soldier and Crow Flame Tribes coalesced together and shot toward Meng Hao&#x2019;s Flame-type totem tattoo.</p><p>The ancient fire character suddenly grew even clearer. Within the space of a few breaths, it was sharp and bright and sent out a sea of flames that surrounded Meng Hao.</p><p>Meng Hao&#x2019;s aura once again climbed upward. Three characters floated around him. Metal. Wood. Fire. Three totems that emanated blinding light. The moment the Fire-type totem began to emit light, Meng Hao&#x2019;s Cultivation base rose up explosively.</p><p>As this happened, the view in front of Meng Hao began to grow blurry. It only took a moment for the blurriness to pass, though. Meng Hao suddenly noticed that the world around him was filled with what looked like countless streaks, as well as nodes like sparks of electricity. It seemed that, if he wished, he could&#x2026; make himself appear at any of these glowing nodes!</p><p>&#x201C;Minor teleportation&#x2026;.&#x201D; Meng Hao&#x2019;s mind spun as he looked around with intensely glowing eyes. Excitement filled his heart, and he took a deep breath. He didn&#x2019;t test it out right away, but he was sure that if he wished, he could merge himself into the air. He knew that he&#x2026; now possessed a divine ability that only the Nascent Soul stage could employ. Minor teleportation!</p><p>With this divine ability, he effectively increased his life force. If he faced up against a powerful enemy, he could rely on this ability to evade.</p><p>&#x201C;My decision to pick the path of the Five-Colored Nascent Soul was the correct one. This path will let me forge my own Dao!&#x201D; He took a deep breath, and his eyes filled with a bright glow of confidence!</p><p>What Cultivators cultivate is&#x2026; confidence!</p><p>Meng Hao breathed deeply as he sensed the power of the three great totems circling around him. He lifted his right hand and waved it forward, causing the sea of flames to spread out. He merged Wood-type power into it, causing it&#x2026; to rage even higher. Any Scorpion Branch Cultivator that it touched let out a bloodcurdling scream and then shot backward in astonishment.</p><p>As for the ten Nascent Soul Cultivators, they had long since fled. Their Cultivation bases were unstable, and they didn&#x2019;t dare to fight Meng Hao at the peak of his power.</p><p>Meng Hao&#x2019;s left hand flickered an incantation and he pointed out, fueling the flames with Metal-type power. They congealed together, filled with golden liquid that suddenly shot out like a golden rain. Everywhere it went, the will of Metal followed.</p><p>The appearance of these divine abilities instantly changed the circumstances of the battle. Although there were more than three thousand Scorpion Branch Cultivators, their hearts were filled with fear. Much the same as the Spider Branch Cultivators before them, they suddenly lost their will to fight.</p><p>By this point, it wasn&#x2019;t just the Crow Scout, Crow Soldier, and Crow Flame Tribe members who were bowing deeply to Meng Hao. The other two of the five Crow Divinity Tribes saw what was happening and felt deep approval for Meng Hao. They also turned toward him and bowed.</p><p>The Crow Soldier Tribe Greatfather and the remaining five Nascent Soul Cultivators all looked at Meng Hao with deep respect. They didn&#x2019;t want to put too much thought into the matter; at the moment, they were able to force their Cultivation bases to remain at the Nascent Soul stage, but in reality, once the battle was over, only three of them would be able to continue to do so. The Cultivation bases of the Crow Gloom and Crow Fighter Nascent Soul Cultivators would soon fall down, and they would no longer be of the Nascent Soul stage.</p><p>&#x201C;Sacred Ancient&#x2026;.&#x201D; Zhao Youlan watched on silently with her phoenix-like eyes. Next to her, Zhao Chunmu&#x2019;s face was pale, and the other Five Poisons Tribe members around him were starting to back up in retreat.</p><p>Meanwhile, some distance away, an old man was watching the scene that was playing out on something that looked like a giant mirror. This old man stood at the lead of an army of nearly twenty thousand Cultivators.</p><p>&#x201C;A change in Sacred Ancients. A Dragoneer turning into an Ancestor. If... if we could research this matter and figure out how this person accomplished such a feat, it would be an unprecedented windfall for the Five Poisons Tribe!</p><p>&#x201C;Pass the order down,&#x201D; the old man continued coolly, a strange light gleaming in his eyes. &#x201C;Spare no cost! Employ teleportation! I WILL lay eyes on this man in the time it takes an incense stick to burn!&#x201D; As his voice echoed out, the Tribe members at his side immediately began to spread the word throughout the Tribe. Roaring sounds filled the air along with the glow of teleportation. Even as all of them began to disappear, a violet raindrop landed on the old man&#x2019;s body.</p><p>&#x201C;Violet rain?&#x201D; said the old man. He looked at it in shock for a moment, then frowned as his body vanished.</p><p>Violet rain once again began to fall. It wasn&#x2019;t just in a small area this time. All of the mountains and even the plains that were home to the Five Poisons Tribe, experienced the rainfall.</p><p>It contained an exterminating coldness, the will of extinction, although it wasn&#x2019;t very intense, but rather, scattered in fragments.</p><p>The rain splashed down onto the ground in front of Meng Hao, mixing with the blood there. Currently, few people noticed it. It was only Meng Hao and a few others who, after seeing it, suddenly hesitated. However, considering that a battle was going on, Meng Hao didn&#x2019;t have much time to think. Floating there in mid-air, his gaze slowly turned cold as he looked across the battlefield toward Zhao Chunmu.</p><p>When this happened, Zhao Youlan&#x2019;s pupils constricted. She had been slowly and unobtrusively edging away from Zhao Chunmu this entire time. However, when she saw Meng Hao look at him, her face flickered. Not caring if her actions were obvious, she immediately shot backward, putting a greater distance between her and Zhao Chunmu.</p><p>Zhao Chunmu also noticed Meng Hao&#x2019;s gaze, and his heart trembled. When he saw Zhao Youlan falling back, his heart and mind filled with a roaring sound, as he suddenly realized that the person who cut off Zhao Youlan&#x2019;s arm&#x2026; was probably this new Sacred Ancient of the five Crow Divinity Tribes.</p><p>&#x201C;He wants to kill me!!&#x201D; he thought, his scalp growing numb. Everything that had just happened with Meng Hao caused his heart to tremble. Meng Hao had slaughtered his eighteen Stealth Guards. Even nine Nascent Soul Elders along with the Supreme Priest hadn&#x2019;t been able to shake him. All of this caused Zhao Chunmu to begin to pant, and he immediately backed up.</p><p>&#x201C;Nine Grand Elders, Supreme Priest, save me!&#x201D;</p><p>However, almost in the exact same instant that Meng Hao looked at Zhao Chunmu, he began to move forward. He shot through the air like an arrow. The nine Elders and the Supreme Priest from the Scorpion Branch hesitated. It only lasted for a moment, however. Gritting their teeth, they shot once again toward Meng Hao.</p><p>A cold smile twisted the corners of Meng Hao&#x2019;s lips. The main reason he had not employed minor teleportation right away was to attract these people over. Zhao Chunmu was nothing more than bait. Unlike Zhao Youlan, he wasn&#x2019;t important enough at the moment that Meng Hao needed to kill him. The people Meng Hao wanted to kill were none other than&#x2026; the nine early Nascent Soul stage Cultivators and the one that was of the mid stage.</p><p>As they neared him, killing intent flickered in his eyes. All of a sudden, he teleported. When he vanished, the faces of everyone who was watching instantly filled with shock. This was especially true of the ten Nascent Soul Cultivators, as they realized that what Meng Hao had just done was not the Bloodburst Flash but rather&#x2026; true minor teleportation.</p><p>&#x201C;Not good!&#x201D; said the Supreme Priest, his face flickering. He looked over at the nine Elders to see Meng Hao suddenly appearing directly behind one of them. His right hand lifted up and then smashed out with the power to destroy a Nascent Soul Cultivator.</p><p>That Nascent Soul Cultivator&#x2019;s face fell. His body immediately began to grow blurry as he attempted to flee via minor teleportation. At the same time, he spit out a colorful beam of light which transformed into talisman paper that shot toward Meng Hao. However, at the same time, Meng Hao&#x2019;s fist, filled with exterminating power, landed.</p><p>A boom filled the air along with a miserable cry. The talisman paper collapsed, giving the Nascent Soul Cultivator just enough time to finish his teleportation. As he disappeared, Meng Hao let out a cold snort. He moved forward and then performed his own teleportation. The two figures grew blurry, and in the blink of an eye Meng Hao had caught up. Once again, his fist descended.</p><p>Another boom could be heard. The Nascent Soul Cultivator spit out a mouthful of Nascent Soul aura. Within were eight magical items, all of which began to explode. Even his body exploded, as he used self-detonation to attempt to kill Meng Hao. A flying sword swept up his Nascent Soul, which borrowed the momentum of the self-detonation to flee away at top speed, clearly weakened.</p><p></p>
