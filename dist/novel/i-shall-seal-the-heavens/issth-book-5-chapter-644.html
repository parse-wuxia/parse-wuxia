<p><strong>Chapter 644: Patriarch, Save Me!</strong></p><p>&#x201C;Another one?&#x201D; Patriarch Reliance&#x2019;s rage once again flared up. He was incredibly indignant. After all the untold difficulties he had gone through to accomplish his goal of sending Meng Hao away, he had almost reached his goal.</p><p>And yet, at the critical moment, one blind fool after another came to stir up trouble. Patriarch Reliance was extremely nervous that Meng Hao would seize some new chance to stay behind on the island. Thus, his rage burned up into the sky. He was about to reach out and crush the newcomer with a palm, when suddenly, a tremor ran through his body. He looked up, and there wasn&#x2019;t a trace of rage on his face. Gone was the easily changeable mood from when he was dealing with Meng Hao. Now, his expression was very serious.</p><p>He stared off into the depths of the sea.</p><p>Next to him, Guyiding Tri-rain also got a strange feeling seemingly from nowhere. She looked up, and her expression flickered. The Boat Spirit appeared soundlessly next to her, and also looked off into the distance.</p><p>Meanwhile, the overbearing old Nascent Soul Cultivator saw the huge pile of Spirit Stones, and it caused his heart to tremble. He glanced around the area, and, seeing nothing out of the ordinary, turned to look frowning at Meng Hao.</p><p>Meng Hao looked back at him, and as their gazes met, he laughed.</p><p>The scene caused the old Nascent Soul Cultivator to get a very strange sensation. He suddenly had the feeling that something fishy was going on, and immediately backed up a few paces.</p><p>He was just about to say something when Meng Hao&#x2019;s face suddenly flickered. He jerked his head to look off onto the distance. At the same time, his entire person erupted with an intensely fierce aura. He didn&#x2019;t grow any larger, but in the eyes of the old man, he suddenly seemed indescribably huge. The old man suddenly felt as if he were nothing more than a bug in front of Meng Hao.</p><p>The explosive aura that roiled off of Meng Hao caused the old man to tremble and pant. His eyes went wide with disbelief, and his mind filled with roaring.</p><p>&#x201C;Great circle of the Nascent Soul stage!!&#x201D; he thought, both his mind and body trembling. The blood drained from his face.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, Meng Hao&#x2019;s aura continued to rise, breaking through a certain barrier that suddenly caused the wind and clouds to surge, and the sky and land to dim. The crackle of thunder could be heard.</p><p>His energy swept over everything for thousands of kilometers in every direction, and a vortex appeared. The vortex spun rapidly, rising up to the point where it seemed to connect Heaven and Earth. Rifts appeared in the air, as if the world itself couldn&#x2019;t handle the explosive power of Meng Hao&#x2019;s Cultivation base.</p><p>&#x201C;Spirit&#x2026; Spirit Severing!!&#x201D; Being in the middle of the tempest made the old man feel like he was a tiny leaf the midst of the raging sea, or a lone boat on the verge of being crushed into tiny pieces.</p><p>His mind buzzed and went completely blank, and his face completely drained of even the slightest bit of blood, until he looked almost dead. His body trembled like a screen, as he stared wide-eyed at the vortex, and Meng Hao, who looked almost like an Immortal.</p><p>&#x201C;I&#x2026; I actually tried to rob a Spirit Severing eccentric&#x2026;.&#x201D; The man&#x2019;s trembling soon was completely replaced by astonishment and indescribable fear. The turn of events left him thoroughly discombobulated. In his estimation, he had just done the most insane thing he had ever done in his entire life.</p><p>As he trembled, he was suddenly incredibly glad that he hadn&#x2019;t finished speaking earlier. Perhaps he still had time to turn around and leave.</p><p>&#x201C;Senior&#x2026;. Senior, I&#x2026;.&#x201D; Even as he began to stammer an explanation, Meng Hao flicked his sleeve. Instantly, all of the Spirit Stones vanished. Completely ignoring the Nascent Soul Cultivator, he flew up into the air and looked off into the distance.</p><p>What he saw was a long beam of light shooting across the sky above the sea. It seemed capable of splitting Heaven and Earth as it shot toward him. Rumbling could be heard, and soon, the image of a white-robed Cultivator became visible within the beam. He didn&#x2019;t look old, but rather, middle-aged. His hands were clasped behind his back as he strode through the air inside of the beam.</p><p>His hair floated around him, and everywhere he passed, distortions spread out. It seemed as if in every place that he passed, the natural laws of the world would change because of him. Waves surged in the sea down below, roaring and rumbling.</p><p>If you looked closely, you would be able to see that in that part of the sea, the waters were sunken down as if by some incredibly shocking pressure.</p><p>&#x201C;He&#x2019;s finally here!&#x201D; thought Meng Hao. His eyes glittered brightly, and without hesitation, he entered the Ninth Anima!</p><p>Boom!</p><p>His body shook violently as an energy even more powerful than before was unleashed within him. He had a Spirit Severing fleshly body, and an energy capable of shaking everything.</p><p>Down below, the Nascent Soul Cultivator coughed up a mouthful of blood and sank down to the ground, quivering. To him, it was like the Heavens were crumbling.</p><p>Of course, the approaching figure was none other than the 10th Wang Clan Patriarch!</p><p>He strode forward, his expression cold, seemingly filled with infinite killing intent. He appeared capable of causing everything around him to collapse into destruction, and each step he took made everything rumble and shake.</p><p>&#x201C;You dared to disseminate your aura to draw me here,&#x201D; he said coolly, his voice crackling like thunder. &#x201C;Who exactly are you relying on for help? Ask them out immediately.&#x201D; His voice caused the entirety of Saint&#x2019;s Island to shake. Mountains crumbled, and countless people on the island cried out in alarm.</p><p>In the Footloose Sect, dozens of beams of light flew up into the air, and the faces of everyone instantly began to flicker with various expressions.</p><p>Up in mid-air, the wind and clouds surged into an enormous, rumbling vortex. It looked almost like doomsday had arrived.</p><p>As the 10th Wang Clan Patriarch entered the airspace over Saint&#x2019;s Island, waves raged in the surrounding sea, from within which could be heard something like desolate howls that echoed about in all directions.</p><p>&#x201C;If you have nobody to rely on for help, well then, you simply won&#x2019;t be able to escape this time.&#x201D; The 10th Wang Clan Patriarch&#x2019;s voice was calm, and did not seem to contain even a scrap of emotion. His eyes were cold as his gaze fell onto Meng Hao.</p><p>As soon as the gaze touched him, a rumbling sound surrounded Meng Hao. Inside of him, the power of seven Cultivation bases within him exploded out, and the strength of his fleshly body radiated out to slam into the pressure of the gaze.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>Rumbling filled Meng Hao&#x2019;s body, and he felt an incredible pressure. This feeling was even more intense than the last time, causing his face to pale. Underneath the pressure, his Cultivation base suddenly condensed from seven parts into six!</p><p>It seemed as if the pressure from the 10th Wang Clan Patriarch was like a grindstone, and Meng Hao&#x2026; was the blade!</p><p>At the same time, the intense power of his Cultivation base exploded out and fought back.</p><p>RUMBLE!</p><p>Blood oozed out of Meng Hao&#x2019;s mouth, and he was sent spinning backward. However, a bright light shone in his eyes as he relied only on his own power to resist the pressure of the gaze.</p><p>The 10th Wang Clan Patriarch&#x2019;s eyes flickered as he gazed deeply at Meng Hao. This was not the same clone that had faced Meng Hao back in the Southern Domain. This was a flesh and blood body, a true clone.</p><p>It was far, far more powerful than the Divine Clone from last time. After all, the will within its gaze could kill a person.</p><p>Down below, the Nascent Soul Cultivator&#x2019;s astonishment had reached a pinnacle. He had no way to even imagine what level of Cultivation base could cause a Spirit Severing expert to be incapable of fighting back.</p><p>&#x201C;This place is a nightmare&#x2026;.&#x201D; He began to tremble violently, and wished he could simply lapse into unconsciousness.</p><p>Meanwhile, back in the palace, Patriarch Reliance&#x2019;s eyes were glittering as he silently observed what was happening.</p><p>A look of anxiety appeared in Guyiding Tri&#x2019;rain&#x2019;s eyes.</p><p>Hovering in mid-air in the seaside region, Meng Hao wiped the blood from his mouth and backed up.</p><p>As for the 10th Wang Clan Patriarch, he was now even more excited about Meng Hao&#x2019;s Dao foundation. &#x201C;It truly is worthy of being called the Perfect Dao foundation&#x2026;.&#x201D;</p><p>He took another step forward toward Meng Hao.</p><p>It was at this point that Meng Hao suddenly shouted out: &#x201C;Patriarch, save me!!&#x201D;</p><p>As soon as the words left his mouth, Patriarch Reliance&#x2019;s face twitched. He pretended as if he hadn&#x2019;t heard, but Guyiding Tri-rain, looking more anxious than ever, quickly turned to look at him.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>Even as he spoke the words, Meng Hao fled at top speed, his body flickering with a bloody glow. However, the 10th Wang Clan Patriarch instantly appeared in front of him.</p><p>&#x201C;Patriarch Reliance,&#x201D; said Meng Hao, using his Cultivation base to cause his words to echo out through all of Saint&#x2019;s Island, &#x201C;I&#x2019;m the only remaining disciple of the Reliance Sect. Even in the Footloose Sect, considering my level of seniority, I should be considered a respected Elder. Can you really just watch on while I get killed?&#x201D; Everyone in the Footloose Sect could clearly hear the words he had spoken. Meng Hao instantly tried to retreat again, but the 10th Wang Clan Patriarch waved his hand out. His shocking killing intent, which contained the will of Dao Seeking, transformed into a black beam that shot toward Meng Hao.</p><p>It moved with incredible speed, but Meng Hao was on guard. The Immortal&#x2019;s sword appeared, which instantly caused the 10th Wang Clan Patriarch&#x2019;s pupils to constrict.</p><p>In that instant, back in the palace, Guyiding Tri-rain gritted her teeth and then suddenly vanished. She transformed into a drop of rainwater, which then shot out of the palace. At the same time, the Boat Spirit also vanished.</p><p>When the raindrop reappeared, it was in front of Meng Hao. It instantly transformed into a sheet of falling rain, which blocked the incoming black beam of light.</p><p>Guyiding Tri-rains voice suddenly sounded out. &#x201C;Your fleshly body is strong, but you can&#x2019;t use it now. Rain is water. Water can become a lake, and that lake wishes to transform into sea. The surface of the sea can ripple; vibration can resist countless powers!&#x201D;</p><p>As soon as Meng Hao heard her, his eyes went wide. Although he recognized the voice, there was no time to reminisce right now. The words seemed to bring him to his senses, and he began to vibrate his body.</p><p>All of this takes some time to describe, but actually happened in the blink of an eye.</p><p>The black beam neared, and as it passed through the rainwater, more than half of it dissipated. What remained slammed into Meng Hao, causing a boom to rattle out. The vibrations of Meng Hao&#x2019;s body, however, transformed into a strange power that caused all the defensive power within his fleshly body to be consolidated into one location. Within the blink of an eye, a hundred vibrations occurred, fighting back against the black beam.</p><p>Meng Hao&#x2019;s body shook, and blood sprayed out of his mouth. As he fell backward head over heels, the rainwater transformed into a young girl who caught him in her arms. The Boat Spirit appeared as well. He waved his sleeve, causing the air to ripple and distort in protection of Meng Hao as they retreated.</p><p>Although they had dispelled the black beam, the ripples that had been sent out as a result had completely destroyed the surrounding land. Everything had been crushed and destroyed, leaving behind a massive crater.</p><p>As Meng Hao retreated, an angry look appeared in his eyes.</p><p>&#x201C;Old turtle Reliance, you&#x2019;re my Dao protector! I can&#x2019;t believe that the restrictive spells placed on you would allow you to just sit by and watch while I perish!&#x201D; Even as he spoke, the 10th Wang Clan Patriarch neared. A look of derision appeared on his face, and he lifted his right hand up. The will of extermination appeared in his eyes as he struck out with his palm.</p><p>As soon as the palm began to move, everything grew dark, as if the the entire world now belonged to that palm. As it descended, Meng Hao, as well as everything in the entire area, began to topple and disintegrate.</p><p>Seeing what was happening, Patriarch Reliance lifted his head up and roared. Meng Hao&#x2019;s words had stabbed him to the heart. He truly couldn&#x2019;t just sit by complacently and watch him die.</p><p>&#x201C;Fudge! Fine, the Patriarch is coming!&#x201D;</p><p>When you added in the flames of fury which still raged inside of him, and the fact that the 10th Wang Clan Patriarch was destroying the entire land with his palm, it all made Patriarch Reliance howl and finally&#x2026;</p><p>Leave the palace!</p><p>-----</p><p><em>This chapter was sponsored by Karen Nguyen, Dennis Liu, and Kristian Seljevold</em></p>
