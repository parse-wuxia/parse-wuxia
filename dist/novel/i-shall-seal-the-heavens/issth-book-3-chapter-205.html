Moonlight could be seen through the clouds, and far in the distance, the glow of the morning sun was just becoming visible. Night was beginning to fade, and sunlight approached.</p><p>As the sun replaced the moon, rain fell down, and Meng Hao proceeded onward. His expression was calm, as if nothing had just happened. This rainy day made him think about the snow back in the State of Zhao.</p><p>He wasn&#x2019;t sure exactly where he was within the Southern Domain. The only thing he could see was a mountain range that stretched off into the distance. His only company was the falling rain and the cold wind.</p><p>His battle with Zhou Jie had confirmed the battle prowess of his five Dao Pillars. He could definitely suppress Dao Children, the most powerful of the Foundation Establishment stage!</p><p>&#x201C;Unfortunately, I&#x2019;m still lacking in terms of techniques,&#x201D; he thought. &#x201C;I have a similar problem with magical items, otherwise I could have completely crushed him.&#x201D; He walked along in the rain, lost in thought. The Cultivation world was much different from the life of a scholar. He was gradually learning how to identify his weaknesses. He could not allow his weaknesses to cause his next battle to end with his own death.</p><p>&#x201C;There&#x2019;s not much I can do regarding magical techniques. Joining the Violet Fate Sect would help a lot, if I could somehow figure out a way. However&#x2026; as for magical items&#x2026;.&#x201D; Meng Hao frowned.</p><p>All of his magical items had been acquired through battle. However, the more powerful his Cultivation base grew, the less effective his magical items became. The wooden swords, the lightning mist and the little black net all grew with him, but as for the fan, the bow and the other items, they were gradually becoming less and less useful.</p><p>&#x201C;I&#x2019;m not completely stuck in this regard, though. I have two methods which can be used to forge magical items. I could go to the Black Lands to search for the Frigid Snow Larva. If I feed it the Sieve Net Thunder Mulberry Leaf, it will transform into the Eyeless Larva, which can produce indestructible silk threads! [1. The Eyeless Larva was last mentioned in <a href="www.wuxiaworld.com">Chapter 165</a>]</p><p>&#x201C;I also have the jade page from Han Bei&#x2019;s ancestor which can be used to forge the Time treasure. Either one of these two could solve my current problem. Unfortunately&#x2026; both are incredibly difficult, and can&#x2019;t be accomplished quickly. Of course, there&#x2019;s also the flag with three streamers, although I can&#x2019;t even touch it with my current Cultivation base&#x2026;.&#x201D; He shook his head, looking around at the unceasing rain. It seemed to be growing heavier. Meng Hao&#x2019;s body flickered, and he shot toward the nearby mountain range. He waved his hand, and a flying sword screamed out and carved an Immortal&#x2019;s Cave into the side of the mountain.</p><p>With the flick of a sleeve, he flitted like a nightingale into the Immortal&#x2019;s Cave, where he sat down cross-legged to meditate. His Cultivation base rippled with power, and the heat which spread out from him caused all the moisture in the newly carved cave to instantly disappear.</p><p>He spat out the lightning mist, which spread out to cover the entire cave, including the entrance. Then he closed his eyes and rotated his Cultivation base. After the time it takes half an incense to burn, he opened his eyes and slapped his bag of holding. When he lifted his hand up, it was holding the Cubic Pearl.</p><p>At first look, it appeared to be square, but upon closer examination, it actually wasn&#x2019;t. It was very bizarre. Meng Hao looked at the pearl and took a deep breath. His eyes shone with anticipation.</p><p>He took out the copper mirror and made a copy. Unfortunately, he didn&#x2019;t have many Spirit Stones left. After hesitating a moment, he decided not to make any more copies.</p><p>&#x201C;I hope this pearl can dispel the poison of the Resurrection Lily,&#x201D; he said, eyeing the pearl with glittering eyes. He wasn&#x2019;t sure exactly how the pearl worked, but he was not the same Cultivator he used to be. He was as powerful as someone from the late Foundation Establishment stage. Without a moments hesitation, he cast his Spiritual Sense into the pearl.</p><p>After a moment, he frowned, then bit the tip of his tongue and spit out some blood onto the pearl. In the blink of an eye, the pearl absorbed the blood, and then suddenly began to melt.</p><p>Strands of white light floated up, along with a delicate, purifying fragrance. Meng Hao&#x2019;s eyes began to shine. After a long moment, he waved his hand, and the Immortal&#x2019;s Cave shook. A crack spread out on the ground, and suddenly a vine burrowed up.</p><p>Under Meng Hao&#x2019;s direction, the vine stretched out toward the white strands, and then began to absorb them. The white strands instantly shot toward the vine, entering into its body. Meng Hao watched on, eyes glittering.</p><p>After the space of about ten breaths, the vine began to change color. Soon, it was no longer dark red, but pure white. A sense of purity radiated out from it.</p><p>More time passed. Meng Hao looked thoughtfully at the slowly melting pearl, and the white strands which floated up from it. His eyes filled with determination, and he began to breathe deeply. The strands flew toward him, entering his body through his mouth and nose.</p><p>He closed his eyes, and after about ten breaths had passed, his body began to quiver. Veins bulged on his face, and his eyes snapped open. Within his pupils could be seen the crying-laughing demonic faces. On top of the faces suddenly appeared layer after layer of white strands.</p><p>It appeared as if the white strands were attempting to purify the Resurrection Lily within Meng Hao.</p><p>Time slipped by. Soon, an hour had passed. Sweat poured off of Meng Hao like rain. His face was pale, but his eyes radiated stubborness. He took a breath, and more white strands floated into his body through his mouth and nose. As they did, the demonic faces in his pupils began to twist and distort.</p><p>Faint screams echoed out in Meng Hao&#x2019;s mind, and his body felt as if it were about to be torn to pieces. There seemed to be a battle of life-and-death going on inside of him. The demonic faces in his eyes were even more twisted. Ghost images appeared, and a black aura began to pour out of the top of Meng Hao&#x2019;s head. The aura twisted and coalesced into&#x2026; a three-colored Resurrection Lily!</p><p>The Cubic Pearl seemed about to darken, as if it were going to release the full power of its aura. It was now half of its original size. It seemed that it would soon have used all of its effectiveness, and the white strands would disappear.</p><p>Meng Hao&#x2019;s eyes shined brightly. Without hesitation, he reached out and grabbed the pearl. This time, he didn&#x2019;t breath in the strands, but actually consumed the entire pearl.</p><p>A roaring sound filled his body that seemed to create a harmony with the crashing thunder on the outside. The Resurrection Lily on his head writhed as if it were being buffeted by a powerful wind. Finally, it showed signs of dissipation.</p><p>Shrill shrieks filled his head, and his face distorted. However, without hesitation, he lifted up the second Cubic Pearl and, gritting his teeth at the loss of Spirit Stones, made another copy.</p><p>After making the second copy, he was now out of Spirit Stones. Eyes radiating stubborness, he lifted both Cubic Pearls and put them into his mouth.</p><p>A shocking, thunderous roar filled Meng Hao as soon as the Cubic Pearls entered his mouth. The roaring was so incredible that it expanded out to fill the surrounding mountains. White strands spread out from Meng Hao&#x2019;s pores, swirling up and surrounding his body.</p><p>The three-colored Resurrection Lily on his head suddenly quivered. It seemed to be fading, as if it would completely dissipate at any moment. As Meng Hao sat there surrounded by the white mist, the demonic faces within his eyes emitted constant ghost images, and slowly began to fade away. It seemed the pearl really was capable of dispelling the poison.</p><p>After about an hour passed, the image of the Resurrection Lily on the crown of Meng Hao&#x2019;s head was almost completely invisible. There was no trace whatsoever of the demonic faces in his eyes. But then&#x2026;</p><p>Suddenly, the mist which had been dispelling the Resurrection Lily suddenly diffused outward. Next, the white strands began to seethe, congealing above Meng Hao&#x2019;s head. A red streak appeared in their midst, followed by a bright yellow streak, and finally a streak as blue as the sky.</p><p>The four colors mixed together within the churning mist, forming together to make&#x2026; a four-colored Resurrection Lily!</p><p>Apparently, the Resurrection Lily couldn&#x2019;t be destroyed. Even as it died, it would reappear as if it had been reincarnated.</p><p>An unsightly expression appeared on Meng Hao&#x2019;s face as he observed the four-colored Resurrection Lily. His eyes glimmered darkly, but then suddenly began to shine.</p><p>Upon closer inspection, it seemed the four-colored Resurrection Lily, which resembled a demonic face, had an aura that was not any stronger than the three-colored Resurrection Lily from before. In fact, this new Resurrection Lily was trembling.</p><p>&#x201C;That&#x2019;s not the fourth color!&#x201D; thought Meng Hao, his eyes narrowing. After thinking back to the four-colored Resurrection Lily he had seen in the Blood Immortal Legacy tournament, he realized that his own Resurrection Lily was different. [1. Meng Hao encountered the four-colored Resurrection Lily in <a href="www.wuxiaworld.com">Chapter 125</a> and the chapter after that. It didn&#x2019;t mention the specific colors of the petals, though]</p><p>&#x201C;If it had actually developed a fourth color, then my consciousness would have been lost, and I would have transformed into a Resurrection Lily. But I don&#x2019;t feel strange at all. Furthermore, the color of this fourth petal&#x2026;.&#x201D;</p><p>Suddenly, the quivering four-colored Resurrection Lily spasmed. Its white petals collapsed into pieces, which then transformed into a white glowing light. The light shot toward the blue petals, and the Resurrection Lily began to tremble even more violently for the space of a few breaths. Meng Hao continued to observe, eyes shining.</p><p>He watched as the blue petals began to wither, and then disappear. Now, the Resurrection Lily was composed of only two colors. Upon closer inspection, the blue petals hadn&#x2019;t completely disappeared, but was still barely visible. In fact, it seemed as if they would gradually reappear.</p><p>The two-colored Resurrection Lily seemed weaker, yet at the same time emanated a pure aura. Apparently, after absorbing the Cubic Pearl, the Resurrection Lily had lost one of its colors. Other than that, it seemed like the poison-dispelling power of Cubic Pearl didn&#x2019;t affect the Resurrection Lily at all.</p><p>The two-colored Resurrection Lily flickered. Meng Hao was powerless to do anything as it slowly sank back down into him through the top of his head. Its aura was much weaker, however. Meng Hao stood up. After a moment&#x2019;s hesitation, his eyes filled with resolve.</p><p>&#x201C;The Cubic Pearl was somewhat effective. However, if I want to completely dispel the poison, I have no other choice than to infiltrate the Violet Fate Sect. There, I can search for a method to completely rid myself of it. This thing is really like a bone stuck in my throat!&#x201D;</p><p>-----</p><p><em>This chapter was sponsored by Fan from WA</em></p><p></p>
