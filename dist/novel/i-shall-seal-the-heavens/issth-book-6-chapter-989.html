<p><strong>Chapter 989: That Same Feeling!</strong></p><p>&#x201C;Third Cleaving, Who Is Most Honored in Heaven!?&#x201D; Zhao Yifan cried out. His Immortal meridians once again sent out incredible pressure, and soon, the power he radiated was equal to more than 140 Immortal meridians!!</p><p>As soon as this power manifested, the Heavens dimmed, and a wild wind sprang up. All of the stars in the sky trembled, and, at the same time, Zhao Yifan began to shake. Having added to his Immortal Realm power by more than fifty percent, he had reached his limit, and was in a state that he could only maintain for a short time.</p><p>&#x201C;Meng Hao, prepare to receive my most powerful attack!&#x201D; He threw his head back and roared, causing the tens of thousands of swords around him to merge together into fourteen Immortal souls!</p><p>These souls, formed by the illusory Immortal meridians of the secret magic, could not measure up to the souls created, one soul per meridian, after corroborating one&#x2019;s Dao and becoming Immortal.</p><p>To the true Immortal Chosen of the Ninth Mountain and Sea, an inhuman cultivator like Meng Hao was someone they simply couldn&#x2019;t measure up to.</p><p>Zhao Yifan&#x2019;s aura surged, and his sword descended. Behind him were 14 Immortal souls, who caused the descending sword blow to become a beam of light that illuminated the entire starry sky. Everyone was dazzled by the blinding, scintillating light.</p><p>Zhao Yifan&#x2019;s most powerful sword attack!</p><p>Rumbling echoed out as the sword shot straight toward Meng Hao.</p><p>Meng Hao&#x2019;s desire to fight seethed as he caused all of his 123 Immortal meridians to rotate at full power. Immortal souls appeared behind him, which was the first time he had used such a power when battling the true Immortal Chosen.</p><p>He advanced, clenching his hand into a fist to deliver, as usual... one punch!</p><p>It was as if, whatever enemies he faced, he would only use his most simple and direct method of attack. One punch!</p><p>RUUUUUUMMMMBLLLLE!</p><p>Massive rumbling filled the area in the starry sky where Meng Hao and Zhao Yifan met in battle. A massive hole tore open in the void. Blood sprayed out of Zhao Yifan&#x2019;s mouth. The light caused by his most powerful attack flickered and then shattered into fragments that spread out and transformed into a tempest.</p><p>Within that tempest, Zhao Yifan could be seen, smiling bitterly, coughing up consecutive mouthfuls of blood. He had lost, but his heart was not defeated. He now knew that he possessed the strength to bare his sword at Meng Hao.</p><p>Meng Hao emerged from within the tempest and then looked back at Zhao Yifan.</p><p>It was in that moment that Fan Dong&#x2019;er surged into action, as did Li Ling&#x2019;er. They attacked virtually at the same time. As for Fan Dong&#x2019;er, the Ninth Sea materialized around her. A pulsing magical symbol appeared on her forehead. With each pulse, her Immortal meridians were increased by ten percent of their original power.</p><p>After it pulsed four times, she had added forty percent to her power, and her Immortal souls had appeared around her.</p><p>She waved her hand, causing the Ninth Sea to shoot forward, filled with countless Sea Dragons. It transformed into something that looked like a huge head, with a solitary horn sticking out of the forehead. It was a Sea Giant that instantly attempted to head-butt Meng Hao.</p><p>Its bright energy surged in all directions!</p><p>In another direction, Li Ling&#x2019;er performed an incantation gesture, causing numerous trees to appear around her. Cracking sounds could be heard as the starry sky around her was transformed into a land mass. In the blink of an eye, more than ninety trees had appeared around her. She continued to perform incantation gestures, then tapped on various areas of her body. More rumbling sounds could be heard as the number of trees increased to more than 130 in total.</p><p>Either of these young women alone could not exceed Zhao Yifan. However, their combined battle prowess was such that even Zhao Yifan&#x2019;s face would turn pale if he faced them in a fight.</p><p>They did not speak to Meng Hao, they simply attacked, in the exact moment in which the fight between Meng Hao and Zhao Yifan concluded.</p><p>Meng Hao turned his head, and his eyes shone with a brilliant light. He snorted coldly and caused the power of 123 Immortal meridians to explode out. All 33 Immortal souls appeared behind him, transforming into 33 Heavens, which emanated astonishing pressure!</p><p>The domineering sensation of the Immortal Realm Paragon suddenly radiated out.</p><p>&#x201C;Think you can beat me? I&#x2019;ll just have to put you in your place!&#x201D; He took a step forward and raised his right hand, not in a fist, but in a palm. He viciously thrust his palm forward, causing the 33 Heavens behind him to shake the starry sky as they transformed into a gigantic hand, which slammed into the Ninth Sea. Huge rumbling sounds filled the air as the seawater exploded. The Sea Dragons let out shrill cries, and the giant with its horned head shattered into pieces.</p><p>As its head exploded, Fan Dong&#x2019;er&apos;s face fell, and she began to retreat. At the same time, Meng Hao advanced, causing the huge hand to rumble directly toward her.</p><p>Fan Dong&#x2019;er&#x2019;s eyes shone with a bright red light as she performed an incantation gesture. Instantly, the corpse behind her looked up and began to emanate an explosive, murderous aura; it appeared to be on the brink of attacking Meng Hao.</p><p>In the same instant that the murderous aura radiated out from the corpse, Meng Hao called out in a towering, dignified voice: &#x201C;Inky, stand down!&#x201D;</p><p>The female corpse immediately bowed its head, the murderous aura vanished, and it even retreated by several dozen meters.</p><p>Fan Dong&#x2019;er stared in shock, and her scalp went numb. In that moment, Meng Hao&#x2019;s attack closed in. Just when it was about to slam into her, though, he heard someone cough dryly in his ear.</p><p>That cough sounded ancient, and it obviously came from the throat of a very old woman. Meng Hao frowned, causing the hand to flip over. Instead of slamming directly into her like had just been about to, it slapped Fan Dong&#x2019;er&#x2019;s rear end.</p><p>&#x201C;Meng Hao, how dare you!!&#x201D;</p><p>As the slapping sound rang out, Fan Dong&#x2019;er let out a shriek, and her face fell. Her buttocks were now uneven, and intense pain filled her trembling body. In fact, it was the most intense pain she had ever experienced in her life.</p><p>Trembling, Fan Dong&#x2019;er was now on the verge of collapsing unconscious. Blood sprayed from her mouth, and she staggered backward, her hatred for Meng Hao rising to near madness.</p><p>When Li Ling&#x2019;er saw this, her expression flickered, and she suddenly stopped in place. Her face was ashen, as if she were suddenly thinking about something very frightening that had happened in the past. Glaring at Meng Hao, she backed up.</p><p>&#x201C;Not quite as good as my wifey,&#x201D; said Meng Hao, turning to look at Li Ling&apos;er.</p><p>Li Ling&#x2019;er gnashed her teeth and performed a double-handed incantation gesture. Instantly, the 130 trees surrounding her exploded, transforming into a terrifying whirlwind which shot toward Meng Hao.</p><p>At the same time as the trees exploded, Li Ling&#x2019;er spit out a mouthful of blood and retreated at high speed. Simultaneously, a cold harrumph could be heard coming from within the explosion.</p><p>&#x201C;Get back here, wifey!&#x201D; Simultaneously, an intense gravitational force latched onto Li Ling&#x2019;er. Her face flickered as she was involuntarily sucked backward towards the whirlwind.</p><p>Within the whirlwind, 33 Immortal souls swirled around Meng Hao. They instantly transformed into 33 Heavens, which bore the brunt of the whirlwind and the exploding trees. He advanced, energy surging, backed by the powerful windstorm.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, Li Ling&#x2019;er was swept up, and was being pulled close to Meng Hao. She gritted her teeth and spun to face him. At the same time, she performed a double-handed incantation gesture, after which the shocking image of a tree leaf appeared on her forehead.</p><p>The tree leaf was emerald green, and as soon as it appeared, a strong life force appeared in Li Ling&#x2019;er. A magic bottle materialized in front of her, which she grabbed and threw toward Meng Hao.</p><p>&#x201C;I knew you would use that move,&#x201D; he said coolly, waving his sleeve. The 33 Immortal souls behind him emanated shocking power, and the magic bottle instantly shattered.</p><p>Blood sprayed from Li Ling&#x2019;er&#x2019;s mouth as she tumbled backward. In that same instant, Meng Hao advanced forward, spanning the distance between the two of them to appear right next to Li Ling&#x2019;er. Then, he raised his hand high into the air, and, as Li Ling&#x2019;er&#x2019;s pupils shrank with fury blazing in her eyes, smacked his palm down onto her rear end.</p><p>This was... the third time!</p><p>Li Ling&#x2019;er let out a miserable shriek as pain exploded throughout her body. Her face went deathly white, and she was sent spinning, her body shaking. She looked back at Meng Hao with intense killing intent.</p><p>&#x201C;Meng Hao!!&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Ah, what a familiar feeling,&#x201D; he said with a cool smile. With that, he paid no further attention to Li Ling&#x2019;er. He had not even used his full power when fighting Zhao Yifan. Rather, he was taking his time to get accustomed to the various degrees of battle prowess that he could display. You could say that the true Immortal Chosen had come to fight him successively. However, this was the optimal situation for Meng Hao; he needed continuous fights like this in order to adapt to his newfound battle prowess in the quickest possible manner.</p><p>Now, he had mostly finished adapting, and his eyes glittered brightly as he looked out into the starry sky.</p><p>At this point, all of the spectators out in the Ninth Mountain and Sea were looking at Meng Hao and his power. This overt display of might caused everyone in the Immortal Realm to be filled with fear, and even caused members of the Ancient Realm to stare in shock.</p><p>&#x201C;He&#x2019;s the... number one figure in the Immortal Realm!&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;He&#x2019;s just fighting the true Immortal Chosen to hone himself! It&#x2019;s like when a mighty sword is forged from divine metal that still need to be sharpened after it comes out of the fire!&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;It&#x2019;s possible that the only person who could be his match is, not someone from his generation, but... someone from the Elder generation!&#x201D; Discussions raged in all corners of the Ninth Mountain and Sea.</p><p>Meng Hao hovered there in the starry sky, looking around calmly as he said, &#x201C;Chosen! Are there any of you left who dare to fight me! If not, then I have some personal matters to handle.&#x201D; He looked down at Planet East Victory, and his eyes flickered coldly.</p><p>If you followed his line of sight, you would see... that he was looking at Fang Wei, who hovered in midair above Planet East Victory.</p><p>Fang Wei opened his eyes slowly and calmly.</p><p>In the instant that they looked at each other, the rumbling sound of teleportation portals could be heard, as three more portals appeared.</p><p>Meng Hao frowned, and originally planned to ignore them and head directly toward Planet East Victory. However, he suddenly stopped in his tracks and turned toward one of the teleportation portals. His eyes suddenly widened, and an expression of disbelief appeared on his face.</p><p>&#x201C;You&#x2019;re not dead?&#x201D;</p><p>A young man walked out of the teleportation portal. He was tall and slender, and although he did not look physically imposing, anyone who looked at him would be able to tell that his fleshly body was terrifyingly powerful.</p><p>&#x201C;No, I&#x2019;m still alive,&#x201D; he said.</p><p>Something that looked like a star rotated slowly on his forehead. However, if you examined it closely, you would see that there were several other stars in the same position, that seemed to have been sealed, causing them to flicker somewhere between illusory and corporeal.</p><p>It was...</p><p>Wang Tengfei!!</p><p>Almost in the same moment that Wang Tengfei appeared, a figure emerged from the second teleportation portal. She floated out, surrounded by a boundless mist of Karma.</p><p>Within the mist, her cold and emotionless eyes pierced out toward Meng Hao, intense to the extreme.</p><p>She was... Ji Yin!</p><p>The last teleportation portal opened, and another young man appeared. He looked like a scholar, and even carried a bamboo scroll in his hand. He looked over at Meng Hao and smiled in a way that seemed sincere, but actually contained boundless coldness. There even seemed to be a hint of jealously buried deep inside.</p><p>&#x201C;Elder Brother Meng, I am Zhou Shui, from the Immortal Ancient Daoist Rite. My master commanded me to come here. Please give me some face by fighting with me for a bit.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Taking turns to fight me?&#x201D; replied Meng Hao. &#x201C;When will this end?! Do you really think that I won&#x2019;t dare to kill people with all of your sects looking on!?&#x201D; His eyes gleamed with intense coldness, but his words were even colder.</p>
