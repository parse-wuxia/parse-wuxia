<p><strong>Chapter 619: Night Awakens!</strong></p><p>The sound seemed to echo out from ancient times. In fact, as Meng Hao looked over, what he really saw was not a head with eyes opened, but rather, a virtually dead Greater Demon.</p><p>It was almost as if everything from before had been an illusion!</p><p>However, the ground was still shaking and rapidly shrinking. That was no illusion. Meng Hao could see, and even detect with Divine Sense, that the mirror, which was the continent, had shrunk down to only several tens of thousands of meters wide.</p><p>From his vantage point, it was now possible to see that the land was rapidly&#x2026; turning into an actual mirror!</p><p>It included all of the lives and magical items on the battlefield. All of them shrank down to become exponentially smaller along with the mirror.</p><p>The head of the Greater Demon could no longer emerge, but rather, sank back down, taking Han Danzi with it. His face was filled with terror and astonishment as he tried every method possible to break free. All were useless. He screamed miserably, hopelessly as he looked down at himself. It was at this point that he realized that&#x2026; he was also&#x2026; sinking into the mirror!</p><p>When his feet touched the land, they sank directly into the water-like surface until he was as far down as his ankles.</p><p>&#x201C;No!&#x201D; he cried out in alarm. &#x201C;How can this be!? This is impossible!!&#x201D; He howled and struggled, but it did absolutely no good.</p><p>Meng Hao trembled. The mirror was now incredibly hot, to the point where white steam was now pulsing off of his hand. He had no choice but to grip it with both hands.</p><p>By now, Meng Hao could sense the indescribable gravitational force being exerted by the mirror. It wasn&#x2019;t targeting Han Danzi, but rather, the entire mirror land.</p><p>&#x201C;It&#x2026;. Don&#x2019;t tell me it wants to suck in the entire mirror land of the Fourth Plane of the Demon Immortal Sect?&#x201D; Having reached this conclusion, Meng Hao began to pant, and his mouth was parched and dry.</p><p>If that was really what was happening, then it would mean that he had gained a colossal amount of good fortune in the ancient Demon Immortal Sect! Such good fortune would be simply unimaginable to anyone else, completely beyond anticipation or expectation.</p><p>Meng Hao palpitated with eagerness as he clutched the copper mirror tightly in his hands and watched the mirror continent below shrinking. An unprecedentedly loud rumbling could be heard filling the entire world. Han Danzi let out a bloodcurdling shriek. He was already sunk halfway down into the surface of the mirror. Next to him, the head of the Greater Demon had sunk back down to the point where its nose was covered.</p><p>&#x201C;How could this be happening! This is impossible! IMPOSSIBLE!!&#x201D; Han Danzi had gone mad; his expression was one of terror. He shouted out toward Meng Hao, begging for mercy and help.</p><p>However, because of the intense rumbling, his voice was virtually undetectable; Meng Hao didn&#x2019;t even notice it.</p><p>The Demonic Qi in the area churned. The shrinking of the land was like the lifting of a veil, revealing something beneath&#x2026;. When Meng Hao looked down, he saw something that caused his mind to reel!!</p><p>There below&#x2026; was a gigantic brain!</p><p>The brain seemed limitlessly huge, sleek and white, with black spots visible in various locations. There were also some areas where brightly colored lights flashed back and forth.</p><p>Every flash of light seemed to contain countless images, almost like memories!</p><p>The sight was completely shocking to Meng Hao. His breath came in ragged pants, and he glanced once again at the shrinking land. Suddenly, he recalled something Han Danzi had said.</p><p>&#x201C;This mirror continent is placed on top of the brain of true spirit Night!&#x201D; Meng Hao took a deep breath and looked down again at the boundless, colossally huge brain.</p><p>&#x201C;Is this place really the head of true spirit Night? If so, what exactly is that passageway?&#x201D; His scalp was numb and his body trembled as he looked around. The mirror-land seemed to be in the final process of shrinking.</p><p>It was now only about 30,000 meters wide, and looked almost exactly like the copper mirror he held, except much larger!</p><p>Han Danzi was almost completely sunk into the surface of the mirror. His face was pale, and he was no longer howling. Instead, he stared at Meng Hao with a venomous, insane look.</p><p>As for the head of the Greater Demon, it had sunk down past the eyes. Only the top of its head remained, along with the three black horns, which emanated a bizarre glow.</p><p>The entire world was shaking.</p><p>30,000 meters. 25,000 meter! 20,000 meters!!</p><p>By this point, sweat was pouring down Meng Hao&#x2019;s forehead. His entire body shook as he clutched at the copper mirror. Were it not for his incredible fleshly body, it might not have been possible to prevent the mirror from slipping out of his hands.</p><p>And yet, even in the Eighth Anima, Meng Hao was incapable of holding on for very much longer.</p><p>It was at this point that suddenly, out of nowhere, a sound could be heard. It was like a baby crying, and it seemed to be coming from the outside world, and yet, at the same time, seemed to be coming from inside, all around him. It started out somewhat weak, and then grew stronger and stronger.</p><p>At the same time, Meng Hao&#x2019;s mind filled with a roaring. Simultaneously, the dancing flashes of electric light on the surface of the brain of true spirit Night suddenly increased by tenfold, as did the speed with which they moved!</p><p>An aura of awakening suddenly covered over everything. Meng Hao&#x2019;s face twitched.</p><p>&#x201C;Hahaha! You&apos;re dead!&#x201D; cried Han Danzi. &#x201C;You shook the seals of the three Holy lands, and thus have awoken true spirit Night! When it awakens, it brings calamity!&#x201D; He began to laugh maniacally.</p><p>Meanwhile, outside of the the Fourth Plane, in the Demon Immortal Sect, the ground was quaking and the mountains were shaking. Rumbling could be heard in all directions as huge cracks and fissures suddenly appeared to spread out across the surface of the land.</p><p>The huge cracks and fissures, the massive rumbling, all of it made it seem as if the Demon Immortal Sect was experiencing doomsday. Ruins toppled and dust flew up in all directions, covering everything and making it hazy.</p><p>Off in the distance, the South Heaven Cultivators fled in shock toward the Demon Immortal Sect&#x2019;s exit gate past the First Peak. They had no idea what was happening, but they could guess. Obviously, something incredible was happening in the Fourth Plane that was connected somehow to the goings on.</p><p>Everything grew dark and the sound of rumbling rose to the Heavens. As the land was shattered, a boundless aura seeped out to flood the entire area. Rifts even began to appear in the air, one after another!</p><p>A middle-aged man stood atop the Fourth Peak, wearing a long white robe. He looked around at everything that was happening, his expression complex. Occasionally, killing intent would fill him, sometimes gentleness could be seen. This was Ke Jiusi.</p><p>&#x201C;If it was anyone else who awoke Night and caused the legacy of Lord Li to appear, I would be forced to kill him. Outsiders cannot acquire the legacy of Lord Li. But him&#x2026;.&#x201D; Ke Jiusi thought back to what he had experienced in ancient times, when he had superimposed with Meng Hao.</p><p>In the end, his father had recognized Meng Hao, acknowledged that they were father and son in that life. The killing intent in Ke Jiusi&#x2019;s eyes slowly dissipated, to be replaced by gentle warmth.</p><p>&#x201C;If he was my father&#x2019;s son in that life, then that means he&#x2026; is my little brother. Maybe I can&#x2019;t acquire the legacy of Lord Li, but if he can, it&#x2019;s the will of Heaven.&#x201D; Ke Jiusi sighed.</p><p>As everything shook, and even more rifts appeared up in the sky above the Demon Immortal Sect. Gradually, the shocking sight of the peaks of three inverted mountains became visible!</p><p>As they appeared to descend, an incredible pressure could be felt. The entire Demon Immortal Sect shook violently. The South Heaven Cultivators were arriving at the exit gate past the First Peak. In their shock, there were already quite a few who had chosen to use their Demon Spirit to leave.</p><p>However, that would take time. As the world shook more and more violently, the sound of a wailing infant suddenly filled the air. It sounded as if there was a baby sleeping deep, deep under the ground, its eyes closed. But then, as it began to awaken, it started to cry.</p><p>Once the sound could be heard, the destruction grew even more intense.</p><p>By now, the three inverted mountains were visible by more than half.</p><p>Meanwhile, back in the Fourth Plane, the great mirror continent had now shrunk down to only about 10,000 meters wide. Han Danzi was now completely submerged inside, gone.</p><p>As for the head of the Greater Demon, only a tiny bit was left visible; the rest had sunk back down into the mirror.</p><p>Meng Hao&#x2019;s face was pale, and his body was slowly moving forward. He was not moving of his own volition, but rather, was being pulled by the copper mirror!</p><p>Closer and closer!</p><p>The mirror continent continued to shrink. 10,000 meters. 5,000 meters. 2,500 meters&#x2026;. 1,500 meters&#x2026;. 1,000 meters&#x2026;. 300 meters!</p><p>The head of the Greater Demon had completely sunk back into the mirror. Back in the calm lands inside the mirror, that Greater Demon who split the Heaven into its third, continued to look up coldly at Meng Hao.</p><p>Its gaze seemed eternal, and as Meng Hao looked at it, his mind trembled. However, there was no time to think deeply about the matter right now. As of now, he was only about 100 meters away from the 300-meter-wide mirror.</p><p>As he got closer, it continued to shrink. 150 meters. 100 meters&#x2026;. 30 meters!!</p><p>25 meters. 15 meters. 5 meters&#x2026;. 3 meters!</p><p>When the mirror land reached a size of three meters, suddenly, it began to distort. Meng Hao watched as it twisted into what looked like strands of silk that then shot toward his own copper mirror.</p><p>The copper mirror seemed to consume them, bit by bit, until they were all sucked in. Within the space of only a few breaths, the entire continental mirror was sucked in by Meng Hao&#x2019;s copper mirror!</p><p>It acted almost like a tonic for the mirror. After the consumption occurred, the copper mirror experienced an unprecedented transformation; all of the bits of rust on its surface completely disappeared!</p><p>The ancient decorative patterns on its surface grew deeper and more profound. Pulses of light could be seen circulating within, and murmuring sounds could be heard like the singing of Immortals.</p><p>Meng Hao&#x2019;s mind trembled. As he looked closer at the mirror, he saw multiple cracks on its surface. They intersected with each other to form nine areas!</p><p>Right now, in the upper left part of the mirror, there was an area that looked completely different from the others. It&#x2026; actually looked like the surface of a mirror. It glowed with the light of magical items, and within, a vortex could be seen, slowly rotating. That vortex seemed to contain the secret of the origin of the world!</p><p>Within the vortex, shockingly&#x2026; was&#x2026; the ancient battlefield!</p><p>At the same time, the Fourth Plane now had no land left in it at all. Instead, the brain was fully revealed. The electric light danced about on its surface a thousandfold more than before. A shocking sound could be heard that far exceeded the wailing of before.</p><p>Night, had been provoked&#x2026; into awakening!</p><p>-----</p><p><em>This chapter was sponsored by Devroy Blake, Lam Otis, Tiago Sturmer Daitx, and Stefan from Sweden</em></p>
