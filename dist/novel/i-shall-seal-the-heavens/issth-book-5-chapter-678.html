<p><strong>Chapter 678: Intrepid Meng Hao!</strong></p><p>Spirit Severing Treasures were items that every Spirit Severing Cultivator had. They were refined in the actual moment of Spirit Severing, created from an object unique to the enlightenment of each individual.</p><p>As for Meng Hao, he chose to use the fading five-colored Resurrection Lily as the basis of his Spirit Severing Treasure, which conformed with his Dao.</p><p>The soulless Resurrection Lily was incapable of struggling. As soon as he grabbed it, it merged into his palm, transforming into the mark shaped like a flower.</p><p>He took a deep breath as he rose to his feet, his Cultivation base flaring. This was a true Spirit Severing Cultivation base, with a three thousand meter Area that belonged solely to Meng Hao.</p><p>Of course, all Spirit Severing Cultivators had their own Area.</p><p>Meng Hao was more slender, and having immersed himself in the great Dao, his fleshly body was now stronger and taller. In the blink of an eye, he reached the absolute pinnacle of the Spirit Severing fleshly body. It was actually impossible for it to progress any further. If it did, it wouldn&#x2019;t be a Spirit Severing fleshly body, but that of Dao Seeking!</p><p>His Cultivation base rocketed up; all the years of practicing cultivation while restricting himself to the Nascent Soul stage had created a buildup that could now explode out.</p><p>In an instant, he was at the limit of the First Severing, a breakthrough which gave him the power of a Second Severing Cultivation base. Now all he lacked was a Second Severing Domain.</p><p>Once he received enlightenment, and actually performed the Second Severing, Meng Hao was confident that he would instantly be&#x2026; at the peak of Spirit Severing.</p><p>His longevity also increased under the powerful life force. His hair turned black, his physique matchless. He looked younger than before, although, his features also radiated a certain ancientness that was clearly visible.</p><p>His entire person experienced a tremendous, earthshaking transformation as he was completely and thoroughly reborn!</p><p>Some distance off in the Milky Way Sea, the 10th Wang Clan Patriarch was panting as he stared off into the distance. His eyes shone with a bizarre light and intense avarice.</p><p>&#x201C;With latent talent and good fortune like that, no wonder he has a Perfect Dao Foundation. It&#x2019;s mine! Definitely mine!&#x201D; In that instant, he vanished.</p><p>At the same time, in the black depths of the Second Ring, the Dawn Immortal&#x2019;s eyes closed. When they opened again, infinite coldness could be seen therein.</p><p>In the Great Tang of the Eastern Lands, the couple stood there. Tears streamed down the face of the woman, tears of joy.</p><p>&#x201C;Without Severing the Spirit, one cannot live past one thousand. My son practiced cultivation for only two hundred years and succeeded in Spirit Severing. He even provoked the descent of a great Dao.&#x201D; She turned to look at the man. &#x201C;How does such latent talent compare to the people of your Clan, huh?&#x201D;</p><p>The man stood there silently for a long moment before sighing. &#x201C;I&#x2019;m not worried about him having poor latent talent. Even if it was worse, he&#x2019;s still our son. Is Immortal Ascension that difficult? What I fear&#x2026; is that his latent talent will be too good. The path of cultivation is not easy to tread. How many people perish upon it? How many people are completely eradicated? How many people are destroyed in body and soul&#x2026;?&#x201D;</p><p>The woman shivered and didn&#x2019;t say anything.</p><p>&#x201C;He also has to deal with his Spirit Severing Tribulation,&#x201D; continued the man softly.</p><p>The woman&#x2019;s face flickered, and she took a step forward. The man grabbed her arm.</p><p>&#x201C;This is his real Tribulation, and there is Karma in everything. If you help him, it will cause the sown Karma to grow greater. When the time comes to reap it&#x2026; the reckoning will also be greater.</p><p>&#x201C;In cultivation, you cannot build up without first tearing down. If he can transcend the Tribulation, then when his day of Immortal Ascension comes, I will take him to the lands of East Victory!&#x201D; The man spoke with determination that could chop nails and sever iron. However, what the woman couldn&#x2019;t see was that concealed in his hand was a medicinal pill.</p><p>It was a type of medicinal pill that was rarely seen in the lands of South Heaven, to the extent that it could be considered a precious treasure.</p><p>&#x201C;Hao&#x2019;er,&#x201D; thought the man, &#x201C;if you fail, father will come to look for you in the cycle of reincarnation. Even if you perish, this medicinal pill can bring you back to life&#x2026;. However, I truly wish that you&#x2026; can transcend the Tribulation on your own.&#x201D;</p><p>Back in the Milky Way Sea, Meng Hao lifted his head up and roared in laughter as his Cultivation base exploded up. The sensation of the power he now grasped filled him with passion. The feeling of finally acquiring freedom made it so that his thinking was suddenly incredibly clear.</p><p>His Divine Sense spread out. It could now reach the 300,000 meter mark. Hosts of magical techniques and divine abilities flashed through his mind, many of which he instantly gained enlightenment of.</p><p>Even as he began to fly up into the air, two beams of light appeared from off in the distance. As they sped toward him, two middle-aged men could be seen, Saint Flying Immortal and Saint Sea Divinity.</p><p>As soon as they caught sight of Meng Hao, they knew that this was the person they were searching for.</p><p>In the success of his First Severing, not only was the Resurrection Lily severed, but also his false appearance, revealing his true features.</p><p>&#x201C;Meng Hao!&#x201D; cried Saint Flying Immortal, his voice rumbling like thunder. The sea churned in response, as if it were about to explode.</p><p>A cold radiance appeared in Meng Hao&#x2019;s eyes. As soon as he looked at the two men, he knew who they were.</p><p>In the moment that Saint Flying Immortal spoke, a glittering glow covered the body of Saint Sea Divinity. Instantly, a set of armor appeared on him, and he strode forward. Even he couldn&#x2019;t help but be moved by the reward promised by the 10th Wang Clan Patriarch; if he could capture Meng Hao, the greatest benefits would go to him.</p><p>He shot with incredible speed directly toward Meng Hao, performing an incantation gesture to summon an enormous trident. Shockingly, the sea stirred, and then vast quantities of seawater shot up into the air to circulate around. As he neared, he pointed out with the trident. The seawater roared as it formed together into the shape of an enormous hand that reached out to grab Meng Hao.</p><p>&#x201C;Are you looking to die?!&#x201D; said Meng Hao. He was already somewhat displeased at the behavior of the Flying Immortal Sect and the Sea Divinity Sect. Now that Saint Sea Divinity was attacking, Meng Hao&#x2019;s killing intent flared. He did nothing to evade, but simply took a step forward.</p><p>That step caused him to slam into the incoming seawater hand. A huge boom echoed out, and the hand collapsed. Meng Hao wasn&#x2019;t harmed in the slightest, and when he emerged from the water, he was directly in front of Saint Sea Divinity. He reached out with his right hand, upon which the Mountain Consuming Incantation manifested. The wave of a hand caused a thousand mountains to appear, all of which smashed down toward Saint Sea Divinity.</p><p>Saint Sea Divinity&#x2019;s face fell and he retreated, waving his arm to cause 100,000 magical symbol spirits to appear. They formed into ten symbol beasts, all of whom radiated the power of a Spirit Severing Cultivation base as they charged Meng Hao.</p><p>Meng Hao gave a cold snort, but didn&#x2019;t dodge. A thousand mountains sent out shocking ripples, and the symbol beasts made from 100,000 magical symbols immediately exploded. It was as if they weren&#x2019;t qualified at all to stand up to the thousand mountains, which then shot toward Saint Sea Divinity.</p><p>Everything was happening too quickly. Saint Flying Immortal had no chance to even react, and Saint Sea Divinity&#x2019;s mind filled with an intense feeling of deadly crisis. He suddenly shouted out, causing his trident to begin to flicker and glow. It instantly transformed into an enormous wall of black sea water in front of him.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>The wall exploded. At the same time, Meng Hao&#x2019;s thousand mountains also disappeared. However, the aftershock of the explosion caused Saint Sea Divinity&#x2019;s face to go pale. As he retreated backward, Meng Hao strode toward him.</p><p>He raised his hand, killing intent flickering in his eyes. He did not use any sort of magical technique or divine ability, but instead, punched out directly.</p><p>As the fist descended upon Saint Sea Divinity, it seemed to blot out the sky. Energy like that of Heavenly might surged, causing Saint Sea Divinity to feel intense fear. He quickly spit a glowing, blue pearl out of his mouth, which then shot toward Meng Hao. Meng Hao&#x2019;s fist slammed into it, and the pearl shattered; it was completely incapable of standing up to Meng Hao&#x2019;s fist, which continued onward to connect with Saint Sea Divinity.</p><p>BAM!</p><p>As the sound echoed out in all directions, blood sprayed from the mouth of Saint Sea Divinity. Cracking sounds could be heard as his armor shattered into pieces. His terror had now reached a pinnacle.</p><p>&#x201C;Flying Immortal, help me!!&#x201D;</p><p>Saint Flying Immortal&#x2019;s face flickered, and he took a deep breath. He had never imagined that Meng Hao, having just stepped into Spirit Severing, would be so terrifying.</p><p>&#x201C;Dammit, even if his Spirit Severing caused strange phenomena in Heaven and Earth, and even if he caused a great Dao to descend, there&#x2019;s no explanation for him to be so inhuman!&#x201D; He was still in the midst of feeling shocked when Saint Sea Divinity called for his help. Gritting his teeth, he shot forward, raising his right hand toward the sky. Instantly, a sword of light appeared, which he grasped in his hand. At the same time, his speed increased rapidly.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, he was upon Meng Hao.</p><p>&#x201C;Area,&#x201D; said Meng Hao coolly, not even turning back to look at Saint Flying Immortal. In that instant, a three thousand foot Area sprang up, a world that contained Meng Hao&#x2019;s Dao and will.</p><p>The Area world!</p><p>Saint Flying Immortal&#x2019;s speed was suddenly reduced. His mind trembled as Meng Hao once again punched out.</p><p>&#x201C;Nine Heavens Destruction!&#x201D; The first punch of the Nine Heavens Destruction, the First Heaven, caused a boom to rattle out. Blood poured out of Saint Sea Divinity&#x2019;s mouth, and his body seemed to be on the verge of exploding. Even as he let out a bloodcurdling scream, Meng Hao stepped forward and punched out with the Second Heaven.</p><p>Then the Third Heaven, and the Fourth Heaven. Saint Sea Divinity&#x2019;s body was blasted apart . His Nascent Divinity flew out, screaming miserably.</p><p>&#x201C;Legacy treasure!!&#x201D; he howled, instantly causing a statue to fly out from inside the Nascent Divinity. The statue was pitch black, and depicted a faceless figure.</p><p>As soon as the statue appeared, it let out a pulsating aura of Dao seeking, which transformed into a wall that expanded out to surround Saint Sea Divinity.</p><p>&#x201C;Legacy treasure?&#x201D; said Meng Hao. He punched out with the Fifth Heaven and the Sixth Heaven. Booms filled the area, and the statue trembled. Then the Seventh Heaven and the Eighth Heaven. The statue shook, and the wall trembled. Inside, despair filled Saint Sea Divinity&#x2019;s face.</p><p>&#x201C;Ninth Heaven... Destruction!&#x201D; said Meng Hao calmly. He lifted his right hand, and this time, it wasn&#x2019;t a fist, but a palm that softly pushed out.</p><p>BANG!</p><p>The wall collapsed, and the statue was sent tumbling back. Inside, Saint Sea Divinity&#x2019;s Nascent Divinity let the last scream it ever would. He was now destroyed in body and spirit!</p><p>&#x201C;How can he be so strong!?!?&#x201D; thought Saint Flying Immortal. Having personally witnessed Saint Sea Divinity perishing, his scalp went numb, and his heart filled with astonishment. He quickly bit down on the tip of his tongue and spit out a mouthful of blood. He burned life force, not hesitating to waste longevity to struggle free from Meng Hao&#x2019;s Area world. He transformed into a beam of light that fled at top speed.</p><p>Meng Hao turned back to look, and his eyes flickered. He raised his hand to collect up Saint Sea Divinity&#x2019;s bag of holding, then waved his arm to summon the war chariot.</p><p>&#x201C;Anyone who chased me along with that 10th Wang Clan bastard will have to pay the price!&#x201D;</p>
