<p><strong>Chapter 200: Killing Amidst the Night Rain!</strong></p><p>At the same moment that the five Sects and two Clans appeared outside of the Sun and Moon mountains of the Song Clan, Meng Hao was inside the world of the cloud vortex, shooting upward. All eyes were upon him as he pressed down on the good luck charm in his hand, pouring power from his Cultivation base into it.</p><p>He had begun to prepare the good luck charm much earlier, so the instant he poured spiritual energy into it, an enormous black hole appeared just in front of him in the sky. All of the Chosen and Nascent Soul eccentrics saw this happen.</p><p>The swirling vortex seemed to transform into a gaping mouth that instantly swallowed up Meng Hao. From below, the Chosen of the various Sects watched on in open-mouthed shock. The Nascent Soul Cultivators could only watch as he disappeared right in front of them. How could they ever have predicted that this would happen?</p><p>Seeing Meng Hao disappear, the Nascent Soul Cultivators were incapable of maintaining their calm. At almost the exact same time, they shot to their feet and flew toward the cloud vortex. Patriarch Song Tian sighed inwardly. He&#x2019;d had no choice but to speak the words he had just now. However, even if this was Song Clan territory, it would be difficult to stand up against all the five Sects and two Clans. For Meng Hao to make an escape on his own was actually for the best.</p><p>At the moment, Song Tian couldn&#x2019;t really prevent the Nascent Soul Cultivators from attempting to pursue Meng Hao. However, moments later, unsightly expressions appeared on their faces. They could clearly see that Meng Hao had used some sort of powerful magic to teleport away.</p><p>&#x201C;It turns out a trifling Foundation Establishment Cultivator like him has a precious teleportation treasure. What other mysteries is this Meng Hao hiding?!&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;The Sublime Spirit Scripture, a precious teleportation treasure. The Violet Fate Sect will definitely get our hands on him!&#x201D;</p><p>The Nascent Soul Cultivators returned, and the representatives of the five Sects and two Clans approached. Meng Hao&#x2019;s good luck charm teleported him away. Meanwhile&#x2026;</p><p>In the Black Sieve Sect, in the number one mountain which was situated in the very center of the Hundred Thousand Mountains, smoke curled into the air above a massive incense burner. At the moment, dozens of Cultivators began to shoot up and disappear into the smoke.</p><p>Down below, Patriarch Violet Sieve and the beautiful, middle-aged woman stood there grimly. They watched as the Cultivators above began to vanish.</p><p>Patriarch Violet Sieve frowned and said, &#x201C;He&#x2019;s using that good luck charm, which makes him difficult to track. If we dispatched Core Formation disciples, or magical items that can employ the power of Core Formation, then it would interfere with the Tri-Black Incense Burner, making it difficult to accurately pinpoint the teleportation ripples. The slightest mistake, and we could be hundreds of kilometers off. Furthermore, the Tri-Black Incense Burner can only be used once per month.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;It doesn&#x2019;t matter,&#x201D; replied the beautiful woman coolly. &#x201C;We may not be able to use Core Formation disciples, but Zhou Jie [1. Zhou Jie&#x2019;s name in Chinese is &#x5468;&#x6770; Zh&#x14D;u ji&#xE9; - Zhou is a common family name. Jie means &#x201C;outstanding&#x201D; or &#x201C;heroic&#x201D;] is among the Foundation Establishment disciples we sent. Considering his Cultivation base, as well as his status as Dao Child, he&#x2019;ll be able to distract Meng Hao. He only needs to keep him in place for a bit. The others can prepare the spell, and then we can be there in an instant. At that time, Meng Hao wouldn&#x2019;t be able to escape even if he was given wings.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Don&#x2019;t forget, we don&#x2019;t know how many times he can use the good luck charm. If it was complete, then he would be able to use it seven times in total.&#x201D; He watched thoughtfully as the last of the disciples vanished into the smoke above the Tri-Black Incense Burner.</p><p>&#x201C;Don&#x2019;t worry,&#x201D; replied the beautiful woman, smiling. &#x201C;Meng Hao is only at the mid Foundation Establishment stage. Based on the information in the ancient records, I did some calculation. Based on his Cultivation base, it should take him the time it takes two incense sticks to burn to be able to activate the good luck charm. As long as Zhou Jie and the others can hold him off for that amount of time, and prepare the spell, then Meng Hao is doomed. He&#x2019;s nothing but a trifling Foundation Establishment Cultivator. Don&#x2019;t worry, Elder Brother Violet Sieve. After that much time passes, we will be there in front of Meng Hao.&#x201D;</p><p>As they continued their discussion, somewhere in an unnamed part of the Southern Domain, in the midst of a mountain range filled with hundreds of mountains, dark clouds filled the sky and lightning crashed down. A roaring filled the sky, causing the wild beasts in these desolate mountains to tremble, seemingly awed by the Heavens.</p><p>Great, bean-sized drops of rain poured down from the sky in a torrent. It was currently sunset, but the sun was completely covered by the clouds, making everything completely dark and hazy.</p><p>A lightning bolt slashed through the sky, and then suddenly ripples expanded out into the air, splitting the sheets of rain. A massive, swirling black hole appeared, and out staggered Meng Hao, his face pale. He immediately looked around.</p><p>The black hole disappeared, and rain fell onto Meng Hao. He didn&#x2019;t even seem to notice it as he examined his surroundings. Finally, he let out a sigh of relief.</p><p>A cracking sound emanated from his hand. He looked down and could see that another large fissure had appeared on the surface of the good luck charm. It seemed he would only be able to use it a few more times before it shattered.</p><p>&#x201C;This is a life-saving treasure,&#x201D; he thought. &#x201C;I can&#x2019;t just use it lightly&#x2026;.&#x201D; He hesitated for a moment, and then took a deep breath. His body suddenly vibrated. The rainwater shot away from him, and his clothes were no longer soaked.</p><p>&#x201C;At the moment, I imagine all the Sects and Clans are looking for me.&#x201D; He frowned. The golden glow of the Sublime Spirit Scripture had not been something he&#x2019;d anticipated. Of course, he&#x2019;d had no other choice than to flee.</p><p>&#x201C;Thankfully, I got the Cubic Pearl. I wonder if it will be able to dispel the poison of the three-colored Resurrection Lily&#x2026;?&#x201D; His eyes began to glow, and he decided to go search for a quiet place in the mountains to carve out an Immortal&#x2019;s cave and test out whether or not the poison could be dispelled. He had just taken a step when suddenly his expression flickered.</p><p>The place where the black hole had appeared moments ago had already returned to normal. And yet suddenly, he could see that another hole was opening up. It was pitch black inside and emanated a rippling power that caused the rain in the area to fly away.</p><p>Killing intent flickered within Meng Hao&#x2019;s eyes. He could choose to flee. After all, the sudden appearance of this vortex could not be a coincidence. It must be someone pursuing him by tracking the ripples of his teleportation.</p><p>But he did not choose to flee. Rather, a cold light, threatening and determined, appeared in his eyes. He could flee for ten or so breaths worth of time, but instead, he decided that he might as well stay and attack.</p><p>As the thought coalesced into his mind, he began to stride forward. He waved his hand, and an enormous Wind Blade and Flame Dragon appeared, which shot toward the black hole and then slammed into it.</p><p>As the roaring Flame Dragon slammed into the black hole, a booming sound filled the air. The black hole began to fall apart. As it did, the shadows of dozens of Cultivators appeared. They began to coalesce, as if they were about to emerge.</p><p>Without hesitating, Meng Hao lifted his hand and bit down hard on one of his fingers. The Blood Finger technique instantly descended onto the weakened black hole.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>The massive booming sound drowned out the sound of crashing thunder. The black hole shook and then exploded into pieces. There were no blood-curdling screams. However, of the dozens of Cultivators who had been about to emerge, only half made it out alive!</p><p>The other half were wiped out with the destruction of the black hole!</p><p>Bloodless killing. It was only possible because of Meng Hao&#x2019;s decisiveness. Had he hesitated or fled, daring not to make a move, then he would now be facing not a dozen or so enemies, but double the current amount.</p><p>The dozen or so people who had appeared immediately erupted with the power of late Foundation Establishment. One in their midst was a man with long, dark hair. He was tall, slender and handsome, with thin lips and a strange glow in his eyes. His Cultivation base was at the great circle of Foundation Establishment, the Pseudo Core stage!</p><p>&#x201C;Black Sieve Sect!&#x201D; Meng Hao&#x2019;s eyes narrowed. He instantly recognized the garments of these Cultivators. His killing intent climbed higher. Now that he knew it was the Black Sieve Sect, everything made sense. He didn&#x2019;t say another word. From this moment forth he would attack with decisiveness, and not the slightest bit of hesitation.</p><p>He stepped forward, his five Perfect Dao Pillars rotating. They didn&#x2019;t leak the slightest bit of power. The raindrops around him vibrated as he approached the nearest Black Sieve Sect Cultivator.</p><p>The man gave a cold snort. He lifted his hand, and the illusory image of a large hand appeared, which shot toward Meng Hao. Without so much as a word, the other surrounding Cultivators also made beelines for Meng Hao.</p><p>Only the Pseudo Core stage Cultivator didn&#x2019;t make a move. Off in the distance, he slapped his bag of holding to produce an incense burner about the size of a hand. He rubbed it, which caused it to ignite.</p><p>Smoke rose up into the air, congealing into concentric rings of magical symbols. It looked very much like a teleportation portal.</p><p>At the same time that the portal appeared, Meng Hao was closing in on the Black Sieve Sect Cultivator who had summoned the illusory hand. The Cultivator smiled ferociously. As far as he was concerned, this whole mission was really making a mountain out of a mole-hill. Being in the late Foundation Establishment stage, he could easily deal with a mid Foundation Establishment stage Cultivator. Wiping him out would be simple.</p><p>&#x201C;I, Xie, shall get the credit for this one!&#x201D; he said, laughing. He shot forward, and as he did so, a multitude of glowing spikes suddenly emerged from his shoulders. He clearly planned to slam them directly into Meng Hao.</p><p>Meng Hao&#x2019;s expression was the same as ever. He lifted his hand and pressed his finger into the approaching illusory hand. A boom sounded out, and the hand immediately disintegrated into countless shards. The Black Sieve Sect Cultivator named Xie stared in shock as Meng Hao closed in on him.</p><p>Meng Hao didn&#x2019;t even look at the man. The power of his Cultivation base, which he had been concealing up to now, suddenly exploded out.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>Pressure billowed out from Meng Hao, and suddenly he was directly in front of the Cultivator. His hand shot out and clasped around the man&#x2019;s neck. Eyes cold, he squeezed.</p><p>A cracking sound could be heard, and the Cultivator&#x2019;s eyes bulged in death!</p><p>This was killing amidst the night rain!</p>
