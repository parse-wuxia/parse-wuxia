He ground his teeth as he subconsciously edged backward. He was now no longer of the late Nascent Soul stage, so facing up against Meng Hao caused his heart to be half filled with fear.</p><p>Even as the words left his mouth, a whistling sound could be heard from off in the distance. It was none other than the Blood Clone. Having slaughtered the two great totemic Sacred Ancients, it was returning, its lust for blood unsated.</p><p>All of a sudden, Meng Hao realized that he couldn&#x2019;t sense a connection to the Clone. In the blink of an eye, the bloody figure was pouncing on the Five Poisons Tribe High Priest.</p><p>This was the same man who had stood lofty and proud outside of the Crow Divinity Tribes those years ago. Now his face filled with shock and he cried out in alarm. Power exploded from his Cultivation base as divine abilities and magical items appeared. He held back nothing in an attempt to block the Blood Clone. However, the Blood Clone charged directly through all the divine abilities and magical items to pounce onto the man. In that instant, time seemed to slow down for a moment.</p><p>When the Blood Clone left the High Priest, the man&#x2019;s body was withered. His life force had been sucked away; even his Nascent Soul was dried up and dead. His body was now nothing more than a desiccated corpse, completely drained of every drop of blood.</p><p>The dried up corpse fell to the ground; the expression on its face was the same expression it had worn before dying, one of dread, shock, and deep regret.</p><p>The Blood Clone shot through mid-air toward the battling Tribe members, slamming into the Five Poisons Tribe Cultivators. It passed through the battleground like a sea of blood, leaving behind only desiccated corpses.</p><p>The Five Poisons Tribe Greatfather watched what was happening, and his aged figure seemed to emanate even more Death Qi. He seemed so old that he might fall into a grave at any moment.</p><p>&#x201C;The Five Poisons Tribe has lost this battle,&#x201D; he said, as the miserable screams continued to echo out. Pain filled his heart as he turned to Meng Hao, clasped hands, and bowed deeply. &#x201C;I would like to earnestly request that the Crow Divinity Tribe totemic Sacred Ancient leave a bit of hope for the Five Poisons Tribe&#x2026;.&#x201D;</p><p>Meng Hao looked back at him silently. More and more bloodcurdling screams filled the air. After a long moment, Meng Hao calmly replied, &#x201C;If the Crow Divinity Tribe were the loser, and I made such a request, would you comply?&#x201D;</p><p>The Five Poisons Tribe Greatfather was filled with bitterness. He knew that such a thing would never happen. If the victor in the battle had been the Five Poisons Tribe, then the Crow Divinity Tribe would have been completely wiped out, including the old, the young and the ordinary Tribe members. The entire Tribe would have been completely eradicated, wiped clean off the face of the earth.</p><p>This was not a personal vendetta; it was a war between Tribes. There would be no mercy, no pity. There was only life... and death!</p><p>&#x201C;I understand. In that case&#x2026;. You and I shall fight!&#x201D; He took a deep breath as he lifted his head up. His eyes filled with the will to go to battle. However, deep within that will to fight was actually a desire for death.</p><p>&#x201C;To be killed by the hand of the Crow Divinity Tribe totemic Sacred Ancient is a worthy death,&#x201D; the Greatfather continued lightly. &#x201C;As the Greatfather of the Five Poison Tribe, I curse you and the Crow Divinity Tribe&#x2026;. On the other hand, despite having met death on this path to the Black Lands, we are both Cultivators of the Western Desert&#x2026;. I hope that in the coming days, the Crow Divinity Tribe&#x2026; will surpass even its former glory. After all, we are all Western Desert Cultivators!&#x201D; With that, his body flickered as he shot toward Meng Hao.</p><p>Meng Hao saw the Five Poisons Tribe Greatfather&#x2019;s desire to die, and inwardly, he sighed with regret. However, this caused no sloppiness in his actions. His eyes glittered coldly as he strode forward.</p><p>The two met in mid-air, causing booms to echo across the battlefield. The Greatfather unleashed one divine ability after another, like a flower who had reached the point of death and wanted to shine with as much life as possible.</p><p>Amidst the booming, magical techniques slammed into each other and divine abilities exploded. Five Poisons Tribe Cultivators were dying everywhere on the battlefield. However, the miserable screams were now growing more faint, weaker, and fewer.</p><p>After the space of ten breaths passed, the Five Poisons Tribe Greatfather coughed up a mouthful of blood. Laughing uproariously, he once again charged toward Meng Hao.</p><p>After twenty breaths, he had lost one of his arms. Still laughing toward the Heavens, he stubbornly charged Meng Hao again.</p><p>Thirty breaths later, a deafening roar filled the air as a gigantic mist rose up into the air. Meng Hao slowly slipped off the blood-colored mask, turned, and walked off. Behind him, the Five Poisons Tribe Greatfather exploded into countless chunks. In the moment before his death, confusion filled his eyes. Within that confusion, was a release from worldly cares.</p><p>He was dead, body and spirit!</p><p>It was impossible to say whether it was by some previous plan, but the instant that the Five Poisons Tribe Greatfather died was the same moment in which the Blood Clone sucked the life and blood out of the very last Five Poisons Tribe Cultivator on the battlefield.</p><p>The battle with the Five Poisons Tribe was now completely over.</p><p>However, even as Meng Hao heaved a sigh of relief, his pupils suddenly constricted. His body suddenly flickered to reappear in front of one of the members of the Crow Divinity Tribe. He lifted his hand up and pushed it out in front of him.</p><p>&#x201C;Screw off!&#x201D; he said, his expression vicious. The sound of his voice was like thunder, shaking everything and echoing out in all directions. His gesture just now seemed to cause the air to rip; ripples spread out to reveal something shooting through the air that Meng Hao had just blocked&#x2026; the Blood Clone!</p><p>This was a Ji Clan Blood Clone which looked like Meng Hao in all aspects except for the bloody glow which emanated off of it. When it appeared, it stood there in front of Meng Hao, its eyes shining with displeasure and struggle. Its lust for blood after killing the final member of the Five Poisons Tribe had caused it to instinctually seek to consume the nearest living thing to it.</p><p>As of this moment, the Crow Divinity Tribe members began to let out sighs of relief. As the frenzy of battle wore off, they quickly fell back, taking the neo-demons with them.</p><p>It took only a short moment for all of the Tribe members and neo-demons to be behind Meng Hao. Even the Outlander Beast retreated, panting, instinctively fearful of the Blood Clone.</p><p>Only the meat jelly and the parrot dared to stand, one on each of Meng Hao&#x2019;s shoulders, arrogantly looking at the Ji Clan Blood Clone who stood up ahead.</p><p>&#x201C;This bastard is too ugly,&#x201D; said the parrot appraisingly. &#x201C;No hair at all, not even one! How could something like this even exist? Although, why does his aura seem so familiar? I just can&#x2019;t seem to place it&#x2026;.&#x201D;</p><p>The meat jelly gave the Blood Clone strange, measuring look, and then greeted it in a very amicable fashion. &#x201C;Heyyy. Hi there! Hello! I&#x2019;m Lord Third. Let me tell you something, do you know how high I can count? I can count to three&#x2026;.&#x201D;</p><p>The Blood Clone stared at Meng Hao, completely ignoring the parrot and the meat jelly. There was an innate haughtiness within the thing that seemed to be at odds with the seal connecting it to Meng Hao. That conflict caused its face to twist and the suddenly let out a howl toward Meng Hao.</p><p>Its Cultivation base was special. It was impossible to sense anything like Core Formation, Nascent Soul or Spirit Severing. It was as if it didn&#x2019;t even have a Cultivation base. All it had was an aura, a fearsome aura that exceeded a Cultivation base. This aura made it seem as if it were a horrible enemy to anything in which life existed.</p><p>Furthermore, it seemed that absorbing the blood and life force of powerful experts caused its aura to grow even stronger. Meng Hao had the feeling that even though he had created it, were it not for the legacy magic of the Blood Immortal as well as various other control techniques, it would be taking instinctive, terrifying actions.</p><p>Looking at the Ji Clan Blood Clone growling there, his heart sank a bit. From the records of the Blood Immortal legacy, he knew that there was always a chance of a revolt occurring when using blood to refine spirits. Generally speaking, that would happen when a Blood Divinity emerged. It rarely happened with Blood Spirits. The chances of it happening with a Blood Clone were virtually nonexistent.</p><p>However, this Ji Clan Blood Clone, which although definitely only in the Blood Clone phase, was suddenly showing signs of revolt. This was no doubt a situation that the Blood Immortal had never anticipated.</p><p>This situation instantly caused Meng Hao to think about that mysterious drop of Ji blood.</p><p>It was at this moment that the Ji Clan Blood Clone&#x2019;s red eyes flickered. It howled and charged directly toward Meng Hao. However, in that instant, Meng Hao&#x2019;s eyes shone with a red light. His pupils turned bright red and magical symbols appeared within them.</p><p>This instantly caused the Blood Clone to scream and back away from Meng Hao.</p><p>Meng Hao gave a cold snort. Lifting up his right hand, he performed an incantation, without the slightest hesitation, using a Blood Immortal legacy technique. All of his power poured into a restrictive seal that he had placed inside the body of the clone during its refinement.</p><p>The Blood Clone screamed miserably and began to tremble. After enough time passed for half an incense stick to burn, it&#x2019;s body suddenly collapsed, transforming into a drop of blood. Meng Hao waved his hand to collect the seal, then picked up the drop of blood.</p><p>As soon as the blood touched his palm, it transformed into a strand of silk. This was a strand of Eyeless Larva silk, which was what Meng Hao had used to form the core of the Ji Clan Blood Clone.</p><p>Meng Hao&#x2019;s expression was the same as ever as he took care of the Blood Clone. However, his heart was filled with somberness. This was the first time that the Blood Clone had shown any signs of revolt, causing Meng Hao to unleash the full power of the restrictive seal. If it happened again, Meng Hao feared that using the same restrictive seal as before would be ineffective.</p><p>His eyes flickered in his thoughtfulness.</p><p>&#x201C;If I refined the Blood Clone using the conjuring method for Blood Spirits, then the effectiveness of the restrictive seal should increase quite a bit.&#x201D; His mind settled, Meng Hao led the Crow Divinity Tribe and the neo-demon horde off of the battlefield. He collected the corpses of the totemic Sacred Ancients, as well as the Five Poisons Tribe&#x2019;s flying machine, and slowly moved off.</p><p>After they left, a ripple appeared in the air atop a mountain not far away from the battlefield, an area that was nearly completely submerged in violet rainwater. Zhixiang magically appeared. She chuckled as looked off in the direction of the departing Crow Divinity Tribe.</p><p>&#x201C;It seems I&#x2019;ve underestimated him again&#x2026;. I assumed that he would have to pay a higher price to achieve victory, perhaps waste some Dancing Sword Qi. I never imagined that all he would have to do was use the power of the Agarwood.</p><p>&#x201C;Just how many times can he summon the Agarwood. And how much of the Sword Qi does he have?&#x201D; Lost in thought, Zhixiang stood there for a while, her brow furrowed. Finally she smiled.</p><p>&#x201C;It doesn&#x2019;t matter. What&#x2019;s the point of trying to figure those things out? There are still many years to go before the Primordial Demon Immortal Plane opens again. I might as well enjoy myself in South Heaven.&#x201D; Laughing, her body flickered and she disappeared.</p><p>The moment she disappeared, Meng Hao, who was leading the Crow Divinity Tribe groups, suddenly glanced over his shoulder, his eyes shining brightly.</p><p>-----</p><p><em>This chapter sponsored by Jazmin Cintora, Lim Derek and Neil Anthony Languido</em></p><p></p>
