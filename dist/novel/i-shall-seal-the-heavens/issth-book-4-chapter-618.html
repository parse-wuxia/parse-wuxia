The spirits of the Demon Immortal Sect won&#x2019;t offer help, but won&#x2019;t resist either. Not even true spirit Night will wake up because of this. Sleeping Night is intelligent, but awakened Night has no mind. It will not awaken, because it does not wish to awaken!</p><p>&#x201C;This is the body of true spirit Night, where its brain exists. They won&#x2019;t be able to escape, nor flee the Demon Immortal Sect. When the ancestor&#x2019;s Divine Clone is fully fused with me, they will become my Demon horde!</p><p>&#x201C;As for you, Meng Hao&#x2026; you will be beneath the sacred ancestor and myself to act as Dharma protector!&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Oh yeah?&#x201D; replied Meng Hao, looking coldly at Han Danzi. He performed an incantation gesture with his right hand, then pointed down at the land. At the same time, the Demonic Qi in the area began to swirl around Meng Hao.</p><p>Whistling sounds could be heard intermittently. Meng Hao suddenly began to perform an incantation gesture which seemed to cause everything in the area to tremble.</p><p>In that instant, all of the Demonic Qi in the entire world began to rotate, as if it were being pulled. Every region began to distort, making the entire world seem as if it were being twisted.</p><p>The sight of it caused Han Danzi&#x2019;s face to fill with a look of shock.</p><p>&#x201C;You&#x2026; you can actually affect Demonic Qi!!&#x201D; he said hoarsely. &#x201C;How can that be? You&#x2019;re a Cultivator, you cultivate the power of Heaven and Earth. That&#x2019;s different than Demonic Qi. They can&#x2019;t be mixed! How can you manipulate Demonic Qi!?!?&#x201D; He was thoroughly shaken, as this was his first time ever seeing Demonic Qi being manipulated by a Cultivator.</p><p>As far as he was concerned, it was inconceivable and unbelievable. Most importantly, it was clear that Meng Hao&#x2019;s manipulation of the Demonic Qi was real, and not an illusion. It was in complete contrast to himself. Whereas his apparent manipulation of Demonic Qi was actually trickery, Meng Hao really was stirring all of the Demonic Qi in the entire world.</p><p>Even as Han Danzi was feeling shaken, Meng Hao took a deep breath. He could sense a resonance between himself and this world. In the outside world, he was incapable of absorbing the power of Heaven and Earth. However, in this place, it was as if a hole had been opened up, and all the Demonic Qi was rushing into it without the slightest impediment.</p><p>And yet, it didn&#x2019;t cause any transformations within him whatsoever. Inside of him, it turned into pure power. It was not Demonic Qi, nor was it spiritual energy. It was a unique power that belonged only to Meng Hao.</p><p>That power circulated about within him, filling him with an indescribably pleasurable sensation. A bizarre light shone in his eyes as he looked down at Han Danzi and the giant head floating there in mid-air.</p><p>&#x201C;Demon Sealing, Eighth Hex!&#x201D; said Meng Hao slowly. It almost sounded as if he were issuing orders. The words echoed about like the peals of thunder.</p><p>Four words exploded like thunder. Four words&#x2026; spoken by Meng Hao!</p><p>As the words sounded out like thunder, all of the Demonic Qi around Meng Hao began to coalesce together. In the blink of an eye, the enormous character for &#x2018;seal&#x2019; appeared directly in front of him.</p><p>The character was fully three hundred meters tall, and it absorbed more and more Demonic Qi as it shot down toward the ground.</p><p>In this moment, within the Eighth Anima, Meng Hao was&#x2026; the Ninth Generation Demon Sealer!</p><p>The speed with which the character moved was indescribable. Han Danzi&#x2019;s face filled with disbelief as he felt an unprecedented pressure weighing down on him, along with a sense of deadly crisis. All of a sudden, he realized that Meng Hao was his archenemy.</p><p>Or perhaps it could be said that he was the archenemy of all Greater Demons!</p><p>Han Danzi began to pant, and suddenly, he recalled a legend.</p><p>&#x201C;According to legend, within the Nine Mountains and Seas, there are a people who can cultivate the Dao and can also fuse with Demons. No type of expulsion is effective on them. They call themselves&#x2026; Demon Sealers!</p><p>&#x201C;The character &#x2018;seal&#x2019; has two meanings. One is to restrict, the other is to aid!&#x201D; [1. In Chinese, the character &#x5C01; can mean to &#x2018;seal&#x2019; in the sense of sealing an envelope. It can also mean to &#x2018;cover&#x2019; or &#x2018;bestow.&#x2019; In Meng Hao&#x2019;s Art of Righteous Bestowal, the &#x2018;bestow&#x2019; word is this same character] Han Danzi&#x2019;s mind trembled as the &#x2018;seal&#x2019; character formed of Demonic Qi descended. All of the Demonic Qi seemed to be affected, making it so that Han Danzi was incapable of dodging or evading. He could only try to fight back directly.</p><p>A huge boom lifted up into the sky. Blood sprayed from Han Danzi&#x2019;s mouth as, in the blink of an eye, he was surrounded by glowing hex light. From a distance, the hex light looked liked strands of silk, binding up Han Danzi.</p><p>It sealed his life force, sealed his Cultivation base, sealed all of him. It sealed him, and it sealed the enormous head.</p><p>Shockingly, the light of the Eighth Hex also thoroughly enveloped the enormous head. From a distance, it looked as if there were some enormous net covering over it.</p><p>The giant net was fused with the ground in the area, and pulled down viciously. Blood oozed out of Han Danzi&#x2019;s mouth, and he trembled. Unable to control his body, he kneeled down onto the ground, his expression vicious. It sounded like he wanted to roar with rage, but was incapable of making a single sound come out of his throat.</p><p>Beneath the power of the Eighth Hex&#x2019;s giant net, the head slowly stopped emerging out. In fact, it began to show signs of sinking back. Meng Hao hovered in mid-air, trembling slightly, his finger still pointing down at the ground. From the time he became a Demon Sealer until now, this was his first time&#x2026; truly sealing a Demon.</p><p>The Demonic Qi in the area continued to rush toward him. He alone had shaken the world and used its power to push down a Demon.</p><p>Han Danzi was pushed down closer toward the ground, his face pale, his eyes filled with frenzy and an unyielding look. The giant head sank back, and soon, half of its mouth was back in the other world.</p><p>However it was then that&#x2026; the Greater Demon in the world of the mirror suddenly looked up. Its gaze seemed to pierce out from the mirror into the outside world.</p><p>A strange look appeared in its eyes, and its mouth twisted into a smile.</p><p>&#x201C;TAI!&#x201D; it said. As the bizarre word echoed out, a change occurred to the giant head emerging from within the mirror world. The aura of death which had previously swirled around it, suddenly seemed to fill with the power of life. Although it did not open its eyes, it did open its mouth.</p><p>The voice which emerged was the exact same voice which had been heard moments ago.</p><p>&#x201C;TAI!&#x201D;</p><p>The sound turned into an attack which spread out in all directions, sweeping over everything. Heaven and Earth filled with roaring, and countless fissures spread out everywhere. The net of the Eighth Hex that covered the head began to shatter into small pieces. In the blink of an eye, it was destroyed and dissipated.</p><p>The Eight Hex which suppressed Han Danzi was also swept away, completely destroyed!</p><p>The Demonic Qi in the world began to roar like exploding thunder. Up in mid-air, Meng Hao coughed up a mouthful of blood and his face went white. He staggered back several paces.</p><p>&#x201C;So, you&#x2019;re a Demon Sealer!!&#x201D; said Han Danzi. A strange light appeared in his eyes, and he lifted his head back to laugh, then shot up into the air.</p><p>&#x201C;Who cares about Demon Sealers!? I&#x2019;ll kill you, take your blood, absorb your soul, and make a Demon Sealing precious treasure!</p><p>&#x201C;It&#x2019;s just the will of Heaven!&#x201D; Han Danzi seemed overjoyed as he shot up into the air. Demonic Qi surged toward Meng Hao, and at the same time, the head began to emerge again. All of a sudden, a neck and two shoulders could be seen!</p><p>&#x201C;The will of Heaven, huh?&#x201D; said Meng Hao, stabilizing himself. He looked coldly at approaching Han Danzi, and the gigantic Greater Demon that he apparently couldn&#x2019;t prevent from emerging. &#x201C;There was no enmity between us. Neither you absorbing the power of that Demon, nor the prospect of bringing it back to life, have anything to do with me.</p><p>&#x201C;What I want isn&#x2019;t you or that Demon, but rather&#x2026; this entire place!&#x201D; A bizarre light shone in Meng Hao&#x2019;s eyes. The current situation now fit in perfectly with his requirements. There was nobody left, so he felt confident enough to&#x2026; take out the copper mirror!</p><p>Even as Han Danzi closed in, Meng Hao slapped his bag of holding with his right hand. Instantly, the copper mirror appeared, the same mysterious copper mirror that he had acquired back in the Reliance Sect all those years ago, which had accompanied him all this time!</p><p>It didn&#x2019;t look like anything special at all, and was even a bit rusted in places. It looked like a completely ordinary item.</p><p>&#x201C;A crappy mirror?&#x201D; laughed Han Danzi. &#x201C;Don&#x2019;t tell me that&#x2019;s supposed to be some kind of precious treasure or something?!&#x201D; He stopped in place, looking as if he didn&#x2019;t care at all about Meng Hao and his mirror. However, inwardly, the fact that Meng Hao had retrieved this magical item in a critical moment left him worried in a way that was quite the opposite to the way he made it look.</p><p>As soon as the copper mirror appeared, the mirror continent below suddenly trembled. Ripples spread out, looking almost like waves on the surface of the mirror-like continent.</p><p>Within the world of the mirror, everything that was alive suddenly stopped moving.</p><p>Even the head which was emerging from inside stopped in place. However&#x2026; it was in this moment that the eyes began to twitch, as if they were struggling to open and awake.</p><p>&#x201C;What is that!?&#x201D; gasped Han Danzi. He was just going to attempt to stop Meng Hao when Meng Hao pointed the mirror directly down toward the mirror continent.</p><p>The two mirrors shone on each other, and anyone who could see them would be able to spot an majestic black hole inside each one. Each black hole seemed endless, as if it contained truths inside that no one would ever be able to understand.</p><p>The great mirror land below began to rumble and shake. The ripples continued to spread out, thicker and more numerous. At the same time, the mirror Meng Hao held began to grow warm, as if it were thirsting for something, as if it&#x2026; wanted to consume the entire mirror continent below</p><p>It was then that the mirror continent, which Meng Hao could not even see the ends of, suddenly began to shrink. It grew smaller rapidly, accompanied by a roaring sound that lifted up into the sky.</p><p>It shrank and shrank, and if you were able to stand in a position far far above, you would see that the lands below&#x2026; shockingly, were actually shaped like a mirror! And as of this moment, the mirror&#x2026; was shrinking down at a rapid rate.</p><p>As the mirror continent shrank, it was possible to see that the shape of the mirror was&#x2026; absolutely identical to the copper mirror that Meng Hao held.</p><p>Han Danzi&#x2019;s face fell. Even as he was about to charge at Meng Hao, his body began to be pulled back by the great mirror continent. His body was out of his own control, and he was incapable of nearing Meng Hao. Instead, a gravitational force pulled him down toward the lands below.</p><p>At the same time, the eyes of the Greater Demon head that was emerging from the mirror land suddenly&#x2026; cracked open. An indistinct, growling voice echoed out, filled with ancientness.</p><p>&#x201C;You&#x2026; actually have&#x2026; the Mountain and Sea Mirror&#x2026;.&#x201D;</p><p>-----</p><p><em>This chapter was sponsored by David Mah and Anonymous</em></p>
