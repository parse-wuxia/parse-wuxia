<p><strong>Chapter 1437: Sealing the World-Slaughtering Finger!</strong></p><p>Lighting was a relatively simplistic Essence. Many Dao Realm experts would gain enlightenment of it as their first Essence. One of the reasons for this was that it was relatively easy to understand. Because of that, Essence of lightning was not uncommon in the starry sky of the Vast Expanse. Even in the Mountain and Sea Realm, or other worlds, Dao Realm experts with the Essence of lightning were nothing rare.</p><p>However, people who transformed the Essence of lightning the way Jin Yunshan had done for his ninth Essence... were as rare as phoenix feathers or qilin horns.</p><p>From this, it could be seen how grand Jin Yunshan&#x2019;s aspirations were!</p><p>As he said, his ninth Essence was not merely the ordinary Essence of lightning. No, his was Tribulation Lightning of the Vast Expanse. If he did manage to Transcend into the Daosource Realm, and become a Dao, then if his suppositions were correct, he could represent the Vast Expanse as the lord of Tribulation Lightning!</p><p>At that time, his level of power would be unimaginable. Although it was currently just speculation on his part, he was confident that he could do exactly that!</p><p>At that moment in the fight, he could sense how strangely powerful Meng Hao&#x2019;s Demon Sealing Hexing magics were. Therefore, Jin Yunshan didn&#x2019;t hesitate for even a moment to call upon his ninth Essence!</p><p>Endless Tribulation Lightning merged together into the shape of a huge finger that seemed capable of destroying everything. Some of the Vast Expanse could even be sensed upon the finger itself, as if anything who opposed this finger also opposed the Vast Expanse!</p><p>Rumbling could be heard as the finger smashed down toward Meng Hao. From a distance, it looked as if it were destroying the starry sky and shredding the Heavens. Even as the vicious lightning bore down on Meng Hao, his hands flashed in a double-handed incantation gesture, unleashing Hexing magic.</p><p>&#x201C;Seventh Hex!!&#x201D; The Seventh Hex exploded out, combining with the power of the Eighth Hex which had just been utilized to lock down onto the finger. Gradually, two threads could be seen, wrapping around the finger!</p><p>Based on the current level of his cultivation base, Meng Hao could now combine the eight hexes, which was his most powerful divine ability. Everything shook violently, and the entire land mass beneath them quaked as the finger rumbled inexorably toward Meng Hao, radiating power that could destroy worlds.</p><p>Meng Hao was shaking, and blood sprayed out of various wounds, as if some invisible pressure were crushing down onto him. He flickered into motion, and every step back caused the ground beneath his feet to crack and shatter.</p><p>&#x201C;DIE!!&#x201D; roared Jin Yunshan; the pressure increased, and the lightning finger continued to descend toward Meng Hao.</p><p>Meng Hao&#x2019;s eyes were crimson. He couldn&#x2019;t stop thinking about the vision from the fresco, but there was no time to contemplate the matter in detail. It was a critical juncture, and all he could do was perform a double-handed incantation gesture to unleash another Hexing magic.</p><p>&#x201C;Sixth Hex!</p><p>&#x201C;Fifth Hex!!&#x201D;</p><p>The finger was now 30,000 meters away from him. As of this moment, the Sixth and Fifth Hexes landed on it with a boom. The two Hexing magics created two more threads which swept out to connect to the Seventh and Eighth Hexes, further binding the finger!</p><p>The finger drew ever closer to Meng Hao, whose eyes widened as world-level destructive power exploded out. It was as if the Vast Expanse didn&#x2019;t even exist any more, and the only thing in the world was this enormous Tribulation Lightning finger!!</p><p>Blood sprayed out of Meng Hao&#x2019;s mouth. He was completely locked down, the ground beneath his feet was being destroyed, and yet he didn&apos;t flinch. His hands flashed in a double-handed incantation gesture as he launched more Hexing magics. The Fourth Hex appeared, and then the Third, creating two more threads which wrapped around the huge finger. As of this moment, six threads were wrapped around it, criss-crossing over each other to form something that looked like a net!</p><p>A boom echoed out as Meng Hao was shoved down again. A huge crater opened up beneath him as the finger neared to a distance of only 6,000 meters!</p><p>The finger was so large it could supercede the starry sky, and yet it was targeting Meng Hao and Meng Hao alone. It didn&#x2019;t affect anyone else present at all.</p><p>Rumbling could be heard as the finger then closed in to a distance of 3,000 meters. It was at that point that the Second Hex appeared, adding another thread to the net entangling the finger, making the net look ever more dense.</p><p>The bones in Meng Hao&#x2019;s body were beginning to emit cracking sounds, but he continued to stare at the finger with ice-cold eyes that radiated killing intent. His Demonic qi was normally kept hidden inside of him, but now it exploded out, and his pupils turned bright red. Furthermore... an aura erupted out of him that was like an Immortal, but not. Similar to a Devil&#x2019;s but also dissimilar. Comparable to a God, but different.</p><p>It was Demonic qi!</p><p>As the Demonic qi spread out, the will of the Vast Expanse which existed on the finger suddenly seemed to seethe, and at the same time, the first land mass that they were on shuddered and began to transform.</p><p>Meng Hao could sense the transformation, but didn&apos;t have the time to study it. His expression was vicious as he looked up at the finger and then began to laugh, a laughter which contained madness, murder, and impetuousness.</p><p>There was something in Meng Hao&#x2019;s aura that caused Jin Yunshan&#x2019;s heart to start pounding for some unknown reason. He wasn&#x2019;t the only one. Everyone who was watching the fight suddenly felt particularly uneasy.</p><p>It was in this moment that, all of a sudden, the Sect Leader opened his eyes and shouted, &#x201C;Jin Yunshan, enough!&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Nobody can stop me from killing this man!&#x201D; Jin Yunshan roared in response. &#x201C;Daoist Vast Expanse, I refuse to believe that you haven&#x2019;t sensed the killing intent directed at him from the necropolis itself!</p><p>&#x201C;Killing him is conforming to the will of Patriarch Vast Expanse!!&#x201D; He performed another incantation gesture, unleashing more power. Disregarding the fact that he was overdrawing his own power, he pushed the finger past the 3,000 meter mark until it was only 150 meters away from Meng Hao.</p><p>Blood poured down Meng Hao&#x2019;s body from the wounds which had been inflicted. He trembled as he stood there, red with madness. By this point, the finger seemed on the verge of touching him.</p><p>&#x201C;First Hex!&#x201D; he growled, waving his finger. At long last, the First Hex transformed into a thread which landed on the finger.</p><p>As of this moment, eight Hexing magics had transformed into threads, which in turn made an enormous net!</p><p>This was the moment Meng Hao had been waiting for. He spread his arms wide, and his eyes gleamed with the desire to do battle. From the moment the battle had begun until now, he had not shown an ounce of fear. His desire to kill Jin Yunshan had not been reduced by one iota.</p><p>&#x201C;Eight Hexes, combine!&#x201D; His hands flashed in a double-handed incantation gesture, and then he waved them out. Instantly, the eight intercrossed threads that formed the net suddenly began to shrink. As they did, they cut everything in their path. It didn&apos;t matter who stood in their way, Tribulation Lightning, Vast Expanse mist, flesh and blood, souls. Everything would be cut!</p><p>Rumbling could be heard as the eight Hexes exploded into action. Meng Hao&#x2019;s Demonic qi also erupted out, pouring into the Hexing magics, transforming the eight threads into objects sharp enough to cut anything in existence. In the briefest of moments... they sliced through the finger, which was only thirty meters away from Meng Hao&#x2019;s head. The finger... was instantly chopped into pieces! The lightning transformed into endless sparks which scattered about in all directions!</p><p>&#x201C;Impossible!!&#x201D; Blood oozed out of the corners of Jin Yunshan&#x2019;s mouth, and his expression was one of disbelief and astonishment.</p><p>&#x201C;You don&apos;t qualify to kill me!&#x201D; Meng Hao said, flicking his sleeve. As the lightning dissipated, all the fetters holding him back vanished. Instantly, he flew forward in shocking fashion.</p><p></p><hr><p></p>
