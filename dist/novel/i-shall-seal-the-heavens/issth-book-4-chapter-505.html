Their eyes radiated killing intent. Meng Hao&#x2019;s gaze was icy cold as his hand stretched out. Suddenly, a long, black spear appeared in his hand.</p><p>This was the spear given to him by Demon Weapon Lonelytomb, refined from the Devil Construct, and filled with ten percent of its power&#x2026; the Devil Spear!</p><p>As soon as the spear appeared, the clouds in the area began to roil, and shocking killing intent appeared.</p><p>The response of the Crow Divinity Tribe, and the appearance of Meng Hao&#x2019;s Devil Spear, instantly attracted the attention of the three great Tribes on the other side of the pass. Smiles appeared on their faces as they looked at Meng Hao. Although they hoped the Crow Divinity Tribe would fight with the Sea Demon Tribe, deep inside, they felt this to be impossible. The Crow Divinity Tribe would only dare to attack&#x2026; if they were crazy.</p><p>Their smiles were noticed by the tens of thousands of Cultivators inside of the pass. In this moment when anything could happen, those tens of thousands of people instantly began to discuss the matter anxiously.</p><p>&#x201C;Those Tribes on the other side of the pass have no way of getting into the Black Lands. They roam about in the area outside of it, plundering and killing. Their main goal is to rob the Tribes that have just emerged from the pass&#x2026;.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;A lot of Tribes have been destroyed in such a way. It looks like those people really do believe the rumor that people have been talking about. Who knows who started it&#x2026;.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;We believe the rumor too. Supposedly, in the final moments of the Apocalypse, when the lands are on the verge of being submerged, whichever Tribe survives the final chaotic battle will have a chance to enter the Black Lands! As long as the three leaders in the Black Lands approve of that Tribe&#x2019;s power, they will be pulled in as an auxiliary Tribe!&#x201D;</p><p>This rumor had been spreading throughout the past few years, and was now deeply ingrained in the hearts of the local Cultivators. Many of the Tribes who were here without Demon Spirits had come to truly believe in the rumor.</p><p>As the discussions continued, Meng Hao stood on the prow of the battleship, Devil Spear in hand. Instantly, black mist began to roil and seethe around him. Within the mist could be seen countless faces, each and every one was vicious and savage. Ear-piercing laughter could be heard that sounded like the cries of nightbirds. It sounded almost like skulls being grated together, cold and hair-raising.</p><p>The Crow Divinity members behind Meng Hao all began to stand up. Killing intent roiled off their bodies, and their bloodshot eyes began to burn as if with fire. Their desire to kill was intense, but their hearts were exceedingly calm.</p><p>As of this moment, each and every one looked like a heroic veteran of hundreds of battles!</p><p>&#x201C;What do you think you&#x2019;re doing?&#x201D; said the Sea Demon Tribe Elder who stood there in the middle of South Cleaving City. He gave a cold, disdainful snort.</p><p>&#x201C;You want to attack the Sea Demon Tribe of South Cleaving Pass?&#x201D; he said arrogantly. &#x201C;You&#x2019;ve got guts, but if you dare to make even a single attack, or spill even a drop of Sea Demon Tribe blood, then your entire Tribe will be exterminated within three days!&#x201D; He was convinced that the Crow Divinity Tribe would not dare to attack. All of this was just posturing in an attempt to reduce the price that would have to be paid to go through the pass.</p><p>He had seen a lot of Tribes like this. Up to this point, not a single one had dared to actually make a move. All had ended up bowing their heads in compliance.</p><p>It wasn&#x2019;t just him who thought in this way. The members of the Sea Demon Tribe up on the walls of South Cleaving City were all laughing coldly, their scorn and disdain clearly visible.</p><p>At the same time, the tens of thousands of other Cultivators within the pass were all panting as they stared at the Crow Divinity Tribe and Meng Hao.</p><p>&#x201C;Will the Crow Divinity Tribe actually dare to attack? I just don&#x2019;t believe it!&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Ever since the Apocalypse began and the Sea Demon Tribe took over the South Cleaving Pass, there has never been a single Tribe who attempted to attack and storm the pass&#x2026;. I think the Crow Divinity Tribe is just doing some saber-rattling.&#x201D;</p><p>Even as the sound of the discussions echoed out, the atmosphere up above in mid-air couldn&#x2019;t be more tense. Suddenly, coldness sprang out from Meng Hao&#x2019;s eyes.</p><p>The Sea Demon Tribe, his arrogance at its zenith, suddenly said, &#x201C;Why haven&#x2019;t you attacked yet? I&#x2019;m waiting for you, you trifling Northern Tribe. You dare to act ferocious, but I&#x2019;m waiting to see if you&#x2019;ll actually have the gall to attack!</p><p>&#x201C;In fact, as of now, I forbid you from saying that you won&#x2019;t attack. Even if you get on your knees and beg, you can forget about paying only half of your resources to get through South Cleaving Pass. You will pay ALL of your resources and ALL of your neo-demons&#x2026;.&#x201D;</p><p>It was at this moment that Meng Hao suddenly flung out the Devil Spear. The pitch black spear shot like lightning through the air. Rumbling filled the air.</p><p>A shrill, screaming sound could be heard, and a sound like something being ripped through, as if the air were being torn to pieces. The Cultivators down below saw a black beam ripping through the air, emanating a shocking aura as it shot directly toward South Cleaving Pass.</p><p>Black mist surrounded the Devil Spear, within which were maliciously laughing faces. The sound of the laughter echoed out, causing all hearts to tremble. In the blink of an eye, the Devil Spear crossed the distance between Meng Hao and the Sea Demon Tribe Elder. The Elder&#x2019;s face filled with shock as the spear appeared directly in front of him.</p><p>His heart trembled as a fierce wind blasted against his face, as well as a sharpness that caused his chest to fill with stabbing pain. His clothing whipped about, his hair was thrown into disarray, and he felt as if he were being strangled. Without even thinking about it, he retreated. Even in his wildest dreams, he would never have imagined that&#x2026; the Crow Divinity Tribe would actually dare to attack!</p><p>Waves of astonishment filled his mind, along with countless questions, making it impossible for him to have the time to dodge. At this point, he couldn&#x2019;t dodge even if he wanted to.</p><p>&#x201C;They actually attacked?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;They did! They attacked!&#x201D;</p><p>The Sea Demon Tribe Elder&#x2019;s eyes went wide and his pupils constricted. His vision was suddenly filled by a black mist. All the onlookers watched wide-eyed as the long, black spear stabbed directly into his chest, tearing apart his clothes, shredding his flesh and blood. It stabbed through his heart, piercing him through, carrying him with it as it continued to scream through the air.</p><p>Blood sprayed from the old man&#x2019;s mouth. He looked down in disbelief at the Devil Spear vibrating in his chest as it carried him through the air.</p><p>&#x201C;How is this possible&#x2026;.&#x201D; He still almost couldn&#x2019;t believe what was happening.</p><p>At the same time, massive amounts of mist poured out from the spear. It looked like countless black snakes as it poured into the Elder&#x2019;s eyes, ears, nose and mouth. It even burrowed into the pores on his skin. As the mist sank into him, countless bloodthirsty faces pounced. The sound of chewing echoed out, accompanied by the bloodcurdling screams of the old man.</p><p>Those screams were filled with indescribable pain. One could only imagine the unprecedented brutality that would cause an early Nascent Soul Cultivator to scream in such a way.</p><p>BAM!</p><p>The Devil Spear slammed into the city wall of South Cleaving City. Cracking sounds could be heard and fissures spread out across the wall as the Sea Demon Tribe Elder was impaled directly onto its surface.</p><p>Looking at the scene, however, the only thing that could be seen was a black mist. As for the horrific screaming, it had long since ceased.</p><p>Everything was deathly quiet. Meng Hao&#x2019;s expressions was the same as ever as he lifted up his hand and made a grasping gesture. Instantly, a droning sound could be heard as the spear dissipated. A black mist of countless vicious faces dispersed and then shot back toward Meng Hao, seemingly eager to report their success.</p><p>At the same time, it was revealed that in the middle of the mist&#x2026; was no body! There was only a skeleton!</p><p>The bones of the skeleton were covered in bite marks, as if they had been chewed upon. Some were even completely crushed. Without the Devil Spear to hold it in place, the skeleton crumbled apart and fell to the ground. Only a few pieces were left, stuck in the cracks in the city wall. The sight was thoroughly astonishing.</p><p>The Sea Demon Tribe members were instantly shaken. The tens of thousands of Cultivators down below in the pass stared with wide eyes and open mouths.</p><p>The three bandit Tribes on the other side of the pass had similar reactions. The scene was completely shocking, causing them to pant and look on with disbelief.</p><p>Not a single person could have predicted that the Crow Divinity Tribe would actually dare to make a move, and that Meng Hao&#x2026; would be so audacious as to slay an Elder of the Sea Demon Tribe.</p><p>Everyone who saw it happen felt as if their heads were about to explode. Each and every one was thinking the exact same thing.</p><p>&#x201C;The Crow Divinity Tribe&#x2026; did the unthinkable!!&#x201D;</p><p>The tens of thousands of Cultivators within the pass stood as still as if they were dead. Only panting could be heard as they looked at Meng Hao and the Crow Divinity Tribe. It was as if this was their first time seeing them. They were overwhelmed with shock. Meng Hao&#x2019;s decisiveness, the awe-inspiring Devil Spear, the shocking attack, all of these things transformed into something like lightning that crashed around inside their minds. The scene just now was something that they would never be able to forget.</p><p>The three Tribes on the other side of the pass, who moments ago had been greedily eyeing the Crow Divinity Tribe, even laughing at them, now felt thunderstruck. Ordinary Tribe members, Priests, and even the Greatfathers were breathing heavily and had looks of amazement plastered on their faces.</p><p>How could they ever have imagined that the Crow Divinity Tribe&#x2026; would really dare to make a move!! Furthermore, they didn&#x2019;t just simply attack. They actually killed someone!</p><p>Such decisiveness, such killing intent, such a desire to exterminate, caused the hearts of the members of these three Tribes to fill with madness. The confidence they had felt moments ago regarding their ability to defeat this opponent, was instantly shaken with grave intensity. Fear suddenly blossomed in their hearts.</p><p>The most shaken of all was the Sea Demon Tribe. Every Tribe member who saw what happened was unable to even react. From the very beginning, they had been literally incapable of believing that the scene they had just witnessed could possibly unfold. They just didn&#x2019;t believe that someone would actually dare to attack the Sea Demon Tribe&#x2026;.</p><p>After a long moment of deathly silence, enraged cries could suddenly be heard from within South Cleaving City. More than a dozen figures emerged to charge forward, followed by tens of thousands of neo-demons and twenty thousand Tribe members!</p><p>Among their number was a red-haired old man, the Greatfather of the Sea Demon Tribe. His face was filled with shock, but also fury. He was clearly flustered and discomfited.</p><p>Before he could even say anything, Meng Hao&#x2019;s black mist returned to him and formed once again into the Devil Spear. He pointed it forward and cried, &#x201C;Fight!&#x201D;</p><p>No more words were necessary. Only one word&#x2026;. Instantly, the eyes of the more than ten thousand Crow Divinity Tribe members turned red, and they began to shout.</p><p>&#x201C;Kill them!&#x201D; As the shocking sound rose up, the entire Crow Divinity Tribe shot forward. They looked like a group of fiends and monsters who had fought and survived hundreds of battles. Their charge was accompanied by dense killing intent which caused even the sky to dim. Clouds amassed up above, making it seem as if they were surging out from the depths of the yellow springs as they charged toward South Cleaving City!</p><p>Even more shocking, it was at this moment that 150,000 neo-demons appeared, bloodthirsty and furious. They blotted out the entire sky as they charged South Cleaving Pass!</p><p>-----</p><p><em>This chapter was sponsored by Allan Tam</em></p><p></p>
