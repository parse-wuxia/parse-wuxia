 <p><strong>Chapter 1317: Killing Intent of a Paragon!</strong></p><p>The sudden appearance of the Paragon Bridge completely shocked the Outsider Paragon; in fact, he recognized it! Back when the great catastrophe occurred, he had not been at the Paragon level, and thus did not play a large role in what happened. However, he had seen this very bridge before, when it was crushed by an attack by the all-powerful Nine Seals and his Mountain and Sea Realm.</p><p>Even thinking about that bitter war left him trembling. Although Nine Seals had long since been destroyed in body and spirit, when this Outsider Paragon thought about him, he was left shaken.</p><p>He didn&apos;t understand it back in those days, but later came to the realization that if Nine Seals had felt like abandoning the Paragon Immortal Realm, no one could have prevented him from leaving.</p><p>In fact, the two terrifying forces who fought in the war years ago would not have been capable of such a feat, not without unleashing their Ancestral Souls. However, the price to be paid for such an act was so high that even those two powers would be hard-pressed to bear the costs. [1. The Ancestral Soul is something that comes up in both Beseech the Devil and Renegade Immortal, mostly toward the latter parts of both stories]</p><p>It was with mixed feelings that Eegoo looked at the Paragon Bridge, and the figures on it. Those figures were shocking, but what was even more astonishing to him was the power of Meng Hao&apos;s divine sense.</p><p>However... even the fact that Meng Hao&#x2019;s divine sense was eighty percent as powerful as his own didn&#x2019;t cause his mind to reel.</p><p>What did that, what caused him to begin trembling, what caused his eyes to suddenly widen&#x2026; was that he had just sensed something within Meng Hao&#x2019;s divine sense.... He had sensed... familiar fluctuations!!</p><p>Those fluctuations left his heart pounding and his mind spinning!</p><p>&#x201C;Nine Seals.... Those are the fluctuations of Nine Seals. This man... is Nine Seals&#x2019; successor!&#x201D; Eegoo felt as if infinite lightning bolts were slamming into his mind. He raised his hand, sending Paragon power to blast away the gigantic hand summoned by Ksitigarbha. Then, killing intent flickered within his eyes as he turned his attention to the Eighth Mountain and Sea.</p><p>There was no way that he... would permit another Paragon Nine Seals to appear!!</p><p>9-Essences Paragons like that were vastly removed from his own level as a 7-Essences Paragon. Although both were called Paragons, the difference between them... was even more dramatic than the difference between 4-Essences Dao Sovereigns and 6-Essences Dao Sovereigns!</p><p>&#x201C;This kid must die! If I don&#x2019;t kill him, then the possibility exists that he will become the second Nine Seals. He could... potentially exterminate all of the 33 Heavens!&#x201D; The Outsider Paragon&#x2019;s mind was spinning as he extended his hand and made a vicious pinching gesture toward the Eighth Mountain and Sea. The power of his cultivation base exploded out, the full might of his Paragon power!</p><p>The Eighth Mountain and Sea trembled, and all the cultivators there, including the Outsiders, began to bleed from their eyes, ears, noses and mouths, as they felt intense pressure weighing down on them.</p><p>Apparently, this Outsider Paragon was even willing to sacrifice the lives of his own people in order to wipe out Meng Hao. He was attempting to crush the starry sky of the Eighth Mountain and Sea, and all living things therein!</p><p>However, it was at this point that a beam of white light shot out from within the Ninth Mountain and Sea. It split the starry sky like a white waterfall as it rose up, whistling through the air toward the 30,000-meter-tall Outsider. When it reached his hand, it exploded, instantly sending the Outsider Paragon&#x2019;s hand rebounding backward!</p><p>&#x201C;I&#x2019;ve been waiting for you!&#x201D; The voice belonged to that of a woman, and it was as cold as ice. It was none other than... Paragon Sea Dream!</p><p>Outsider Paragon Eegoo looked up, and his eyes swirled with killing intent. &#x201C;Sea Dream!! You&#x2019;ve managed to stay alive by means of a secret magic all these years, but your Essences have been destroyed. Your cultivation base is like nothing compared to back then. If you force yourself to fight, it will only hasten your death. If you had avoided resisting us, then I would have let you be. After all, the destruction of the Mountain and Sea Realm has nothing to do with you. And yet, you still dare attack me?!&#x201D;</p><p>Paragon Sea Dream appeared off in the distance, slowly striding forward. Her voice cold, she said, &#x201C;Back when I achieved my Dao, you were nothing more than an ant.</p><p>&#x201C;Later, when I was a Dao Sovereign, I encountered you, dying, whereupon you dropped to your knees and pleaded with me to prevent you from getting sucked into the cycle of reincarnation.</p><p>&#x201C;After I became a Paragon, you didn&#x2019;t hesitate to run your clan into the ground, all so that you could acquire a Celestial Emperor Flower. Why? To fawn on me in the hopes that I would give you the magic you needed to break through to the Dao Lord level.</p><p>&#x201C;And now you, a member of the Drakewyrm Tribe, dare to bare your fangs in front of me?&#x201D;</p><p>The Outsider Paragon&#x2019;s face flickered in response to Sea Dream&#x2019;s coolly spoken words. Every sentence that came out of her mouth seemed to dredge up bad memories in the Outsider, causing the killing intent in his eyes to intensify.</p><p>&#x201C;If you want to die,&#x201D; Eegoo said, &#x201C;then I&#x2019;ll fulfill your desire!&#x201D; The Outsider Paragon knew that, thanks to Sea Dream&#x2019;s interference, killing Meng Hao was now an impossibility. Furthermore, despite the words of contempt he had spoken toward Sea Dream, he still feared her.</p><p>After all, when he was still just a child, Paragon Sea Dream had been one of the Paragons of the Paragon Immortal Realm. She had an incredible standing, and could unleash shocking magical abilities so far above his own as to be utterly incomparable.</p><p>Rumbling could be heard as the Outsider Paragon attacked, and he and Paragon Sea Dream began fighting in the starry sky far up above the Mountain and Sea Realm!</p><p>Their battle caused the entire world to tremble, the Heavens to flash with colors, and the starry sky to grow dim.</p><p>In almost that same moment, the Outsider Imperial Lord&#x2019;s eyes flickered away from Meng Hao and focused onto the Fourth Mountain. Snorting coldly, he transformed into a beam of light that shot in that same direction!</p><p>His target was Ksitigarbha, who was able to wield the power of an Imperial Lord!</p><p>As he neared, Ksitigarbha looked up, and the boundless Joss Flame power transformed into a huge vortex, which shot toward the Outsider Imperial Lord, instantly enveloping him.</p><p>Shocking booms rang out as the two of them began to fight!</p><p>As for the remaining Outsider Dao Sovereigns, their eyes flickered with brutal gleams.</p><p>One of them, the one in the golden armor, slowly said, &#x201C;This kid from the Eighth Mountain and Sea is mine!&#x201D;</p><p>The other one laughed, then closed his eyes, whereupon his body twisted and distorted, becoming five separate streams of green smoke that shot in five different directions through the void.</p><p>The destinations of those streams of smoke: the First, Second, Third, Eighth and Ninth Mountains!</p><p>Their targets were not ordinary cultivators, but rather... the Mountain and Sea Lords of those very mountains!</p><p>Shockingly, he was using his own power to simultaneously fight against five Mountain and Sea Lords!</p><p>Rumbling sounds echoed out from those five mountains as powerful magical techniques suddenly exploded into being.</p><p>The golden-armored Outsider Dao Sovereign was the one who had already clashed with Meng Hao, just moments ago. He licked his lips, and killing intent swirled in his eyes as they locked onto Meng Hao&#x2019;s position within the Eighth Mountain and Sea. He wasn&#x2019;t sure why his own exalted Paragon leader specifically wanted Meng Hao dead, but he didn&#x2019;t care. Considering that his cultivation base was at the Dao Sovereign level, cutting down someone at the 5-Essences level, even if they were at the peak, would not be very difficult.</p><p>The thing he cared about the most was that Meng Hao had killed his Junior Tribesman Lord White, someone who had made heroic contributions to the 1st Heaven!!</p><p>Because of all Lord White&#x2019;s services, the tribe had already arranged for his bloodline to be awakened upon his return, which would enable him to rise to the level of a true Dao Sovereign. They had even made preparations to appoint him as a tribe Elder.</p><p>But before that could happen, he had been cut down right in front of the golden-armored Outsider.</p><p>This Outsider wanted nothing more than to kill Meng Hao, and that desire was growing stronger. The only thing he needed to be mindful of was Meng Hao&#x2019;s terrifying divine sense, but by this time, he had already taken precautions against it.</p><p>Grinning, he strode forward, then slashed out at the starry sky, which shattered apart as he bore down on the Eighth Mountain and Sea, bursting with killing intent.</p><p>&#x201C;So, how do you want to die, kid? I&#x2019;ll let you decide.&#x201D;</p><p>Sinister laughter rang out as the Outsider Dao Sovereign picked up speed. From a distance, he looked like a golden shooting star, piercing through the starry sky in Meng Hao&#x2019;s direction.</p><p>A strange light appeared in Meng Hao&#x2019;s eyes; his blood was already pumping. His cultivation base erupted as he strode forward. One step. Two steps. Three steps.... In the blink of an eye, the Outsider Dao Sovereign was upon him, but by that time, he had already taken seven steps.</p><p>When the seventh step landed, his energy spiked, increasing exponentially. At the same time, his divine sense shot out, and the Paragon Bridge rumbled down. Then, Demon Weapon Lonelytomb suddenly appeared in his right hand!</p><p>The power of Meng Hao&#x2019;s fleshly body converged on the spear, along with energy from his cultivation base and magical techniques. That rumbling power seemed to freeze the starry sky, and the killing intent became completely focused.</p><p>&#x201C;Not bad....&#x201D; the Outsider Dao Sovereign said, pupils constricting. Suddenly, he opened his mouth and roared, sending out monstrous sound waves. Astonishingly, the image of a giant appeared behind the Outsider Dao Sovereign. The power of six Essences also erupted out, forming a tempest. At the same time, a statue appeared in his hands.</p><p>That statue depicted a lizard, and as soon as it appeared, a strange aura erupted out which began to suppress Meng Hao&#x2019;s divine sense!</p><p>It took only a moment for his divine sense to drop from eighty percent of the power of a Paragon, to half of that!</p><p>Then, the windstorm began to fight back against the power of Meng Hao&#x2019;s spear.</p><p>RUUUUUUMMMMBLLLLE....</p><p>Massive sounds tore at the starry sky. After extinguishing five Soul Lamps, Meng Hao could unleash incredible power that was only a hair away from the 6-Essences level. However, when facing a true 6-Essences cultivator, that simply wasn&#x2019;t enough!</p><p>As his divine sense was suppressed, the feeling of deadly crisis in his heart grew more intense.</p><p>The Paragon Bridge collapsed, and Demon Weapon Lonelytomb recoiled backward. Blood sprayed out of Meng Hao&#x2019;s mouth as the backlash hit his cultivation base, scattering it. His fleshly body was slashed viciously, sending blood and gore flying about.</p><p>The Essence tempest surrounding the Outsider Dao Sovereign weakened a bit. Although he had been capable of suppressing Meng Hao&#x2019;s attack just now, he had been forced to go all out to do so. That was especially because of the bizarre Demon Weapon Lonelytomb, which caused him to frown.</p><p>He took a step forward, flickering to appear in front of the seriously wounded Meng Hao. Eyes glittering with a cruel light, he didn&#x2019;t attempt to kill him, but instead opened his mouth wide and lunged toward Meng Hao&#x2019;s head.</p><p>&#x201C;I&#x2019;ll eat you and absorb your power!&#x201D; Bizarre light shone in the eyes of the golden-armored Outsider. However, in the same moment that his jaws were about to latch onto Meng Hao, Meng Hao&#x2019;s eyes suddenly flickered. Although his injuries had seemed severe, the combination of the Eternal stratum and the Green Emperor&#x2019;s Eternal Incantation transformed into something like an undying, unkillable secret magic! He recovered almost instantly!</p><p>Then, he clenched his hand into a fist and began to punch the Outsider Dao Sovereign!</p><p>Life-Extermination Fist!</p><p>Bedevilment Fist!</p><p>God-Slaying Fist!!</p><p>BOOOOOOOOOMMMM!</p><p>Those three fist strikes slammed into the Outsider Dao Sovereign, who had never expected that Meng Hao would have a secret magic that would enable him to recover so quickly. His eyes went wide, but he was too slow to avoid Meng Hao&#x2019;s successive blows.</p><p>Blood sprayed out of his mouth as he was sent tumbling back. Enraged, he was just about to counterattack, but unfortunately, he was not familiar with Meng Hao&#x2019;s fighting style. Once Meng Hao won the initiative... he never let go!</p><p></p><hr><p></p>
