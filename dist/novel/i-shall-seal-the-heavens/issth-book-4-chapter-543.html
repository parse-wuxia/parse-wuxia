<p><strong>Chapter 543: Seizing Treasures!</strong></p><p>This power of Time gave Meng Hao an intense sense of grave crisis. As the blood moved backward toward him, violet light suddenly flickered in his eyes. The East Pill Division catalysis technique, the Time magic from Han Bei of the Black Sieve Sect, and the technique he had learned from the jade page, all combined into a branding mark that Meng Hao placed onto the mouthful of blood.</p><p>This was also a power of Time. However, instead of causing Time to flow backward, it did the opposite. The power exploded out, fighting back at the power from the Wheel of Time. Roaring rose up into the air. At the same time, Patriarch Huyan was incapable of avoiding the mastiff, which teleported in to once again wound him with its slashing claws. Meng Hao&#x2019;s body was currently recovering. He suddenly transformed into a green smoke and a black moon, disappearing in the blink of an eye.</p><p>Patriarch Huyan made a slight, &#x201C;Eee?&#x201D; sound. By this point, Meng Hao had already reappeared in mid-air, blood seeping out of the corners of his mouth. There was no time to wipe it away. He looked over at Patriarch Huyan, his eyes glittered with killing intent.</p><p>&#x201C;Blood Mastiff!&#x201D; bellowed Meng Hao. He shot up into the air, performing an incantation and then waving his arm. Instantly, an enormous face appeared. Simultaneously, the mastiff began to glow with a bright, bloody light that merged into the blood-colored face.</p><p>Combining the Blood Immortal divine ability with the power of the Blood Mastiff resulted in&#x2026; a true Blood Immortal magic!</p><p>Before the mastiff had awakened, what Meng Hao could utilize could be counted as skills lacking true magic. Now, however, he was using true magic, a true divine ability!</p><p>The fact that Meng Hao was able to evade the Wheel of Time left Patriarch Huyan amazed yet again. That was especially so because the method he had used to escape the Time reversal technique&#x2026; was also Time!</p><p>&#x201C;Your name isn&#x2019;t Meng! It&#x2019;s Han!&#x201D; said Patriarch Huyan. This caused Meng Hao&#x2019;s pupils to constrict, and gave birth to a new idea. He did not respond to the words. Instead, he caused the battle prowess of sixty-four Nascent Souls to explode out. Instantly, the blood-colored face transformed into sixty-four separate faces, which transformed into ghost images that then superimposed over each other. Then they combined and shot toward Patriarch Huyan.</p><p>As the blood-colored faces whizzed forward through the air, Meng Hao slapped his bag of holding to produce his Wooden Time Swords. He did not employ their power of Time, but rather treated them as ordinary flying swords. They stabbed through the blood-colored face and then shot toward Patriarch Huyan.</p><p>Patriarch Huyan frowned. He had a sneaky suspicion about what was going on. His right hand lifted up as he flashed an incantation gesture then pointed toward the Wheel of Time. Instantly, the ancient, black chariot wheel began to spin again. The power of Time then exploded out.</p><p>A massive roaring sound could be heard. Ripples caused the Violet Sea down below to seethe. Meng Hao&#x2019;s Blood Immortal divine ability face suddenly began to whither. In the blink of an eye it transformed into gray ash.</p><p>It was at this point that the Time Sword Formation appeared. The formation trembled as it shot out. For some reason, the formation seemed somewhat different than it had in the past.</p><p>It was as if encountering this new power of Time had somehow changed the Time Sword Formation.</p><p>At the same time, Patriarch Huyan&#x2019;s Wheel of Time suddenly stopped moving and seemed to fade. The Time power inside of it was as boundless as ever, though. Patriarch Huyan performed an incantation and pointed, causing the black wheel to fly screaming through the air toward Meng Hao.</p><p>Meng Hao continued to shoot backward in retreat. He spit out a mouthful of blood and then produced a medicinal pill which he immediately consumed. He then made a grasping motion with his right hand, causing the Devil Spear to appear. Although it appeared to be much more faint than before, there were still countless vicious, howling faces within its mist.</p><p>Without hesitation, Meng Hao shot backward, hurling the Devil Spear out. It buzzed through the air as it headed toward the black chariot wheel.</p><p>Next, Meng Hao&#x2019;s eyes began to shine with a strange light. He flicked his right sleeve, and at the same time, sent his Divine Sense into the Blood Immortal mask. Considering that he was currently in the Seventh Anima, as soon as his Divine Sense touched the flag of three streamers, he was able to fully employ the true power of the first streamer of the flag.</p><p>The air around him vibrated and distorted as a streamer as red as the color of blood suddenly appeared in Meng Hao&#x2019;s hand. It rippled in the air as Meng Hao waved it, causing a blood-like wind to suddenly rise up!</p><p>This was different from the times Meng Hao had wielded the flag of three streamers on previous occasions. This was the true manifestation of the first streamer, and was not illusory like before. The blood-colored tempest that the treasure gave rise to caused Patriarch Huyan&#x2019;s face to fill with astonishment.</p><p>&#x201C;That flag&#x2026;. Dammit! How could you have an Immortal treasure like that!?&#x201D; Even as Patriarch Huyan was expressing his disbelief, the flag unfurled, transforming into a red banner that stretched out in front of Meng Hao toward the Wheel of Time.</p><p>Although it takes some time to describe, the Devil Spear and the flag of three streamers instantly shot toward the black chariot wheel. There was no hesitation on Patriarch Huyan&#x2019;s part as he performed a double-handed incantation in an attempt to control the wheel treasure.</p><p>However, even in the middle of the incantation, the mastiff suddenly pounced toward him. It had reached a frenzied state, as if it didn&#x2019;t fear death at all. As it neared, the bloody light shining off of it flickered in intensity and transformed into countless threads that slashed toward Patriarch Huyan.</p><p>Patriarch Huyan was cursing inwardly. His hatred for the mastiff had already sunk deep into his bones. Yet again, he realized that if it weren&#x2019;t for the damnable Immortal Beast, the battle would have gone much more smoothly.</p><p>While Patriarch Huyan was being pinned down by the mastiff, Meng Hao&#x2019;s eyes glittered with a red light. His aura exploded up into the heavens. He was utilizing sixty-four times the battle prowess of a great circle Nascent Soul, and Divine Sense with a range of 29,999 meters. Together, they formed into&#x2026; a divine ability!</p><p>&#x201C;Demon Sealing, Eighth Hex!&#x201D; His hair whipped about and his Cultivation base rotated rapidly. Demonic Qi in the area seethed as he lifted his hand up and pointed his index finger straight out ahead of him toward Patriarch Huyan.</p><p>As he pointed, blood oozed out of Meng Hao&#x2019;s nose, ears and eyes. Popping sounds could be heard within him, and his brain and body filled with a roaring sound.</p><p>Meng Hao&#x2019;s eyes were awash with madness. However, beneath that madness was utter calm. He was sealing a powerful Spirit Severing expert, so he would of course have to pay... a heavy price.</p><p>But, why did that matter?</p><p>A tremor ran through Patriarch Huyan&#x2019;s body. The Demonic Qi in the area was boundless and majestic, and formed into something like a sea. In the blink of an eye, it wrapped around Patriarch Huyan, transforming into a seal. His Cultivation base was suppressed and he suddenly&#x2026; ceased all movement.</p><p>&#x201C;What divine ability is this!?!?&#x201D; Patriarch Huyan was completely shocked. The mastiff seized this opportunity to strike out with its paw. Roaring could be heard, and blood sprayed from Patriarch Huyan&#x2019;s mouth. His expression was one of savageness.</p><p>However, the brief pause imposed upon him damaged his connection to the Wheel of Time, almost as if his Divine Sense had been severed. Only a tiny connection remained. However, it was at this moment that the Devil Spear bore down onto the wheel. It stabbed directly into it, causing a massive explosion to ring out. Even though the spear was greatly weakened, vast quantities of mist still poured out of it, causing the wheel to tremble violently and then move about a third of a meter to the side.</p><p>It was a small movement, but it instantly weakened the final scrap of Divine Sense which connected the Wheel of Time and Patriarch Huyan. This caused Patriarch Huyan&#x2019;s face to flicker once again. It was in this moment that the flag of three streamers hit the wheel. A boom rose up into the air. Meng Hao shouted, and the flag&#x2026;</p><p>Completely wrapped around the wheel, then heaved it to the side. Booms could be heard. The wheel turned into a black, trembling beam of light that moved a full thirty meters off to the side. The movement caused any remaining connection with Patriarch Huyan to be completely destroyed!</p><p>All of this took place in the amount of time it takes for a spark to fly up into the air. The effect of the Eighth Demon Sealing Hex was already vanishing from Patriarch Huyan. Blood sprayed from Meng Hao&#x2019;s mouth as he once again used the Eighth Demon Sealing Hex, ignoring any injuries he would receive in the process.</p><p>Just when Patriarch Huyan recovered use of his Cultivation base, it was once again sealed! At the same time, the Blood Mastiff, in response to Meng Hao&#x2019;s Divine Sense, roared. Bloody light shot up, and the power of its Spirit Severing Cultivation base rocketed out as it charged again toward Patriarch Huyan.</p><p>As of now, Meng Hao was completely ignoring Patriarch Huyan. Instead, he shot directly toward the Wheel of Time. The single flag streamer teleported to join him.</p><p>A fierce light gleamed in Patriarch Huyan&#x2019;s eyes. In this critical moment of the battle, the power of his Cultivation base suddenly exploded out. He raised his head up and howled as the Demonic Qi seal surrounding him collapsed. He had extricated himself and restored his Cultivation base. But now, the mastiff was upon him, and he was forced to fight.</p><p>Temporarily, Patriarch Huyan was incapable of completely freeing himself. His fury burned like raging fires, consuming him as he howled in rage.</p><p>As for Meng Hao, he was just now slamming into the Wheel of Time.</p><p>He flicked his sleeve, causing the single streamer to wrap up the Wheel of Time, which Patriarch Huyan had lost control of&#x2026;. Then, he collected up the streamer and&#x2026; put it into his bag of holding!</p><p>He&#x2026; shockingly captured Patriarch Huyan&#x2019;s precious treasure!</p><p>Earlier, when Patriarch Huyan had claimed that his surname was actually Han, it instantly made him think of Han Bei. He also thought about that Patriarch of the Han Clan who could control the power of Time.</p><p>All of the various threads of information formed together to give Meng Hao the audacious idea of stealing Patriarch Huyan&#x2019;s treasure!</p><p>All of his actions up to this point had been aimed at snatching away the treasure! He even allowed himself to be injured in the process! The benefits of acquiring such an item were indescribable!</p><p>&#x201C;Meng Hao!!&#x201D; roared Patriarch Huyan, his eyes filling with veins of blood along with killing intent. He wanted to pursue Meng Hao, but the howling Blood Mastiff then attacked him once again. Pinned down, Patriarch Huyan could do nothing but be consumed by his indescribable rage. This mastiff, which seemingly didn&#x2019;t fear death in the least, had the power of Spirit Severing. Patriarch Huyan wasn&#x2019;t capable of killing it, nor even sealing it. He could only watch helplessly as his treasure was stolen away by a great circle Nascent Soul Cultivator. The shame and rage that he felt were virtually driving him insane.</p><p>In all the years he had practiced cultivation, he had almost never been put into such a difficult position. His rage could not grow any more.</p><p>Meng Hao&#x2019;s eyes flickered with killing intent. He had made a lot of preparations with the intent of facing Patriarch Huyan. As of this moment, his preparations had been used by about half. He still had more tricks up his sleeves. His trump card of fusing with the Violet Sea, had not been brought into play yet.</p>
