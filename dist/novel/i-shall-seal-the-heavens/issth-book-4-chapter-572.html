<p><strong>Chapter 572: The Legacy of Lord Li</strong></p><p>Meng Hao felt as if this identity he had acquired did come with its advantages, but also a lot of pressure. As a silk-pants, he could act virtually without the slightest scruple. However, this was an enormous Sect, and Sect rules could not be blithely ignored.</p><p>&#x201C;It&#x2019;s too bad I couldn&#x2019;t find Patriarch Huyan&#x2026;. I won&#x2019;t be able to track down any of the others any time soon either. In that case, there&#x2019;s no need to work so hard to try to find them. I&#x2019;ll just focus on acquiring Daoist magic legacies right here.&#x201D;</p><p>When he entered the Immortal&#x2019;s cave, Ke Yunhai was sitting cross-legged on his stone bed. He looked at Meng Hao and gave a cold harrumph.</p><p>&#x201C;Do you know what your mistake was this time?&#x201D; asked Ke Yunhai, his voice cold.</p><p>Meng Hao looked back at him but didn&#x2019;t say anything.</p><p>&#x201C;Your mistake was that you shouldn&#x2019;t have brazenly killed a fellow disciple!&#x201D; continued Ke Yunhai slowly.</p><p>Meng Hao&#x2019;s eyes glittered.</p><p>&#x201C;Your mistake was that you should have picked some other time to attack!&#x201D; Ke Yunhai waved his hand dismissively, clearly disappointed that Meng Hao was like iron who had failed to turn into steel, and had completely fallen below his expectations.</p><p>&#x201C;Killing is nothing,&#x201D; he continued. &#x201C;I&#x2019;ve killed countless people in my life. When we Cultivators practice cultivation, we must do so with a clear conscience. You surely had a good reason to kill him, that I know. You normally act with cleverness, but in this situation, were crude and rash. Did you need to get rid of him in fear that he would go into hiding?</p><p>&#x201C;Well, whatever your enmity with him, considering your status, you can&#x2019;t simply go killing people in broad daylight in front of a big crowd!&#x201D;</p><p>As Meng Hao looked at Ke Yunhai, his heart trembled. The trembling originated from his very soul, and from the vague image of his own father that existed within his memories. Suddenly, he laughed.</p><p>Perhaps he had forgotten for a moment that he wasn&#x2019;t really Ke Jiusi. Perhaps Ke Jiusi wanted to remind him that he wasn&#x2019;t really a member of the Demon Immortal Sect.</p><p>After all&#x2026; I am Meng Hao, and I am also Ke Jiusi.</p><p>He suddenly spoke. &#x201C;I think my real mistake&#x2026; was attacking with my own hand.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Eee?&#x201D; said Ke Yunhai, looking at Meng Hao.</p><p>&#x201C;I shouldn&#x2019;t have killed him myself,&#x201D; said Meng Hao softly. &#x201C;I should have talked to you about it, sir. A word from you, and he would have been dead. Then things wouldn&#x2019;t have been so problematic.&#x201D;</p><p>Ke Yunhai stared at him with wide eyes. After a moment, he started chuckling. His chuckling grew louder and louder until it wasn&#x2019;t clear whether he was furious, or actually laughing uproariously. He suddenly waved his hand, causing a gentle breeze to spring up that healed all of Meng Hao&#x2019;s wounds.</p><p>After that, he sighed deeply, and then made a grasping motion toward that oil lamp that had the body of a dragon and the wick of a phoenix. Instantly, two glimmering streams of light shot out. At the same time, the power of Heaven and Earth in the area grew intense to the extreme. It began to converge, forming together in front of Ke Yunhai as if weapons were being constructed. Soon, two large stone statues could be seen.</p><p>Each of the two statues were as tall as a person, and pitch black. They held greatswords in hand, and looked like the type of <a href="cn.bing.com" target="_blank">soldiers buried with dead bodies</a> in tombs. Banging sounds could be heard as they dropped down to slam onto the ground.</p><p>Their aura was enough to cause Meng Hao to begin to pant. He felt an incredible pressure weighing down on him that exceeded that from any powerful expert he had ever felt.</p><p>At the same time, Ke Yunhai pointed at Meng Hao. His forehead suddenly split, and two drops of blood flew out. They swirled through the air toward the two statues, then merged into them.</p><p>As soon as that happened, the eyes of the stone soldiers flickered, as if they now possessed consciousness. As Meng Hao looked at them, he got the feeling that with a mere thought on his part, he could control these two terrifying soldiers.</p><p>&#x201C;These two stone soldiers have your soul blood inside of them,&#x201D; he said, giving Meng Hao a deep look. &#x201C;No matter how many tens of thousands of years pass, no matter how many difficult situations they go through, no matter how many Masters they have, when you stand in front of them, they will recognize you as their most supreme and ultimate Master!&#x201D; Ke Yunhai&#x2019;s face was a bit ruddy, and his hair seemed a bit more gray, even white.</p><p>&#x201C;When the Ke Clan kills people, we don&#x2019;t ask for help from outsiders. Now, get out of here. Do your best to gain enlightenment regarding the Soul Divergence Incantation. Oh, and&#x2026; don&#x2019;t cause any more problems for your old man, okay? You&#x2019;re not a kid any more, try to act a bit more mature&#x2026;.&#x201D; He sighed.</p><p>Meng Hao coughed dryly and nodded. His eyes were glowing with a strange light as he suddenly looked up at Ke Yunhai, a bashful expression on his face.</p><p>&#x201C;Dad, do you have the Mountain and Sea Scripture?&#x201D;</p><p>Ke Yunhai stared in shock, then slammed his palm down onto the stone bed.</p><p>&#x201C;You little brat! The Mountain and Sea Scripture? Do you think I founded the Demon Immortal Sect?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Oh. Well, even just a bit of information about it would do,&#x201D; Meng Hao replied quickly.</p><p>&#x201C;You can&#x2019;t even get the Mountain and Sea Scripture from the three great Demon Mountains of the Second Heaven, or the two Holy Lands of the Third Heaven!&#x201D; he said angrily. &#x201C;Do you really think that your dad, mere Lord of the Fourth Peak of the First Heaven, could really request the Mountain and Sea Scripture from the slumbering Lord Li in the Fourth Heaven?</p><p>&#x201C;If you really want the Mountain and Sea Scripture, there&#x2019;s only one way to get it, and that is to acquire the legacy of Lord Li that he left behind before going into slumber. Whoever can reach the Fourth Heaven and stand directly in front of Lord Li, can get that legacy!&#x201D; With that he waved his hand dismissively.</p><p>&#x201C;If you don&#x2019;t have the Mountain and Sea Scripture, that&#x2019;s okay,&#x201D; said Meng Hao quickly. He didn&#x2019;t mind settling for second best. &#x201C;Dad, you know those 3,000 Daoist magics that you can only get through meritorious service to the Sect? Do you think you could use your influence&#x2026; to get them for me?&#x201D;</p><p>Ke Yunhai&#x2019;s eyes widened and he stared in shock at Meng Hao.</p><p>&#x201C;3,000 Daoist magics?&#x201D; Ke Yunhai spluttered furiously. &#x201C;Do you really, actually believe that the Demon Immortal Sect was founded by me?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;2,999 would also be okay, but not any less than that,&#x201D; replied Meng Hao, grinding his teeth.</p><p>&#x201C;Screw off! I don&#x2019;t have them!&#x201D; roared Ke Yunhai, waving his right hand.</p><p>&#x201C;If you give me enough techniques, then I can focus on calmly practicing cultivation on the Fourth Peak&#x2026;.&#x201D; said Meng Hao, using his trump card. When he said this, Ke Yunhai&#x2019;s hand suddenly stopped moving. He hesitated for a moment as he looked at Meng Hao. Then he let out a long sigh.</p><p>&#x201C;Considering my status, the best I can do is give you three hundred Daoist magics. If you can fully gain enlightenment of all of them, then I&#x2019;ll see what else I can do.&#x201D; Shaking his head, he made another grasping motion. His hand seemed to disappear into the air, and he closed his eyes for a moment. When he pulled his hand back, it was holding a jade slip. He tossed it toward Meng Hao, and then waved his wide sleeve, causing a raging wind to pick up Meng Hao and the two stone soldiers and send them out of the Immortal&#x2019;s cave.</p><p>In the middle section of the Fourth Peak was a luxurious area filled with glittering lights and exotic plants. The large door of the Immortal&#x2019;s cave there was imposing to the extreme. This was none other than Ke Jiusi&#x2019;s Immortal&#x2019;s cave.</p><p>Meng Hao&#x2019;s heart was beating with excitement as he carried the jade slip toward the Immortal&#x2019;s cave, as well as the two stone soldiers, which had shrunk down and now fit in his palm. There were about a dozen footmen waiting for him inside. Once they caught sight of him, they all smiled and clasped hands in greeting.</p><p>Meng Hao quickly found that no matter what he wanted to do inside his Immortal&#x2019;s cave, there would always be someone to help him.</p><p>He couldn&#x2019;t help but sigh emotionally. He had never experienced such luxury, not even when he was a Violet Furnace Lord back in the Violet Fate Sect. It was something he couldn&#x2019;t quite get used to. After a bit of time, he sent the footmen away.</p><p>Finally alone in his huge Immortal&#x2019;s cave, he sat down cross-legged to examine the stone soldiers and the jade slip.</p><p>Even after trying, he was not able to put any of them into his bag of holding. However, he was able to take items from within his bag of holding and bring them out.</p><p>At first he hadn&#x2019;t noticed anything unusual about his bag of holding. However, after he thought about it, he realized that there was something odd about Ji Mingfeng. What was odd was that he had no bag of holding. In fact, Ji Mingfeng had been nothing but a soul.</p><p>His soul had fused with the host body, but was still nothing more than that; a soul fusion.</p><p>Muttering, Meng Hao thought about what Ke Yunhai had told him about Lord Li, the three great Demon Mountains, and the two Holy Lands&#x2026;. The information regarding those things contained in Ke Jiusi&#x2019;s memories were rather vague.</p><p>&#x201C;I remember Zhixiang also told me a few things&#x2026;.&#x201D; Eyes glittering, he committed the new information to memory to think about another time. As for Zhixiang, he was confident that she would come looking for him eventually. After all, Zhixiang&#x2026; was a true disciple of the Demon Immortal Sect!</p><p>&#x201C;When that time comes, I can get answers to everything!&#x201D; He didn&apos;t consider the matter any more. Currently, there were quite a few strange things going on with his body. His Cultivation base was only of the great circle of the Nascent Soul stage, which was actually quite weak in the Demon Immortal Sect. And yet, neither Ke Yunhai nor anyone else seemed to notice that. When they looked at him, they didn&#x2019;t see anything out of the ordinary.</p><p>There were other strange things that Meng Hao could only attribute to the fact that this was the Second Plane of an ancient illusory world. This was all just a dream of the Demon Immortal Sect.</p><p>Although the dream seemed incredibly realistic, and was filled with limitless possibilities, a dream&#x2026; was still just a dream, not reality.</p><p>A thought suddenly sprang into being in Meng Hao&#x2019;s mind. &#x201C;What if it could be real&#x2026;?</p><p>&#x201C;What if all of this could be made real&#x2026;?</p><p>&#x201C;What if all of it could become true&#x2026;. What if actual changes could be made to the great river that is the flow of time?&#x201D; Then he looked at the stone soldiers, which clearly could not be put into his bag of holding, and he sighed. He knew that such an outcome was impossible. After all, this place was just a dreamland.</p><p>However, he couldn&#x2019;t help but feel a bit of pity regarding the two stone soldiers. If he could take them out with him after he left the Primordial Demon Immortal Plane, it would make him incredibly happy.</p><p>&#x201C;Daoist magic legacies are the most important part of the Second Plane!&#x201D; he thought, his eyes glowing with determination. Forgetting about the impractical matters, he took out the jade slip, closed his eyes, and began to attempt to gain enlightenment.</p><p>After a moment, his eyes opened, and they were filled with blankness.</p><p>&#x201C;Lightning Spirit Incantation&#x2026;. Borrow the will of Heavenly lightning, fuse it into the body to create a soul. Use the Soul of Lightning to refine a Spirit of Lightning. Transmogrify the fleshly body to form a bolt of lightning of Heaven and Earth, benefit from an eternally indestructible Divinity&#x2026;.&#x201D; Muttering to himself, Meng Hao continued to study the jade slip.</p><p>His expression grew more and more serious, and he was breathing heavily. Occasionally, he would open his eyes, shocked by what he had learned of the various Daoist magics. He had never imagined that there would be such a variety of divine abilities and magical techniques in the world, and that they could be so unimaginable.</p><p>There was one magic that could take the rainbows which appear after the rain and transform them into a Seven-Colored Fish. With that fish, one could leap into the starry sky and swim about the Mountains and Seas as a greater Demon.</p><p>There was another that focused on observing the clouds and wind to perform augury within the Earth and the Yellow Springs. By using an Imperial will, one could understand the Will of Heaven. By understanding the Will of Heaven, the natural law of Heaven and Earth could be changed. Planets could be destroyed, and a mere thought could shatter even the most ancient of things.</p><p>There was an entire host of divine abilities and magical techniques.</p><p>One of them was called the Fish Roc Will. It was entirely based on the use of Divine Will. When the myriad of transformations were cultivated to the very peak, one&#x2019;s body could become that of a roc!</p><p>The technique made him think of the strange roc in the Rebirth Cave.</p><p>Everything filled Meng Hao with an unimaginably fantastic feeling. As time passed, he gradually came to realize that of the techniques of the Demon Immortal Sect, more than half were actually&#x2026; Demon magic!</p><p>-----</p><p><em>This chapter was sponsored by Tyler Glembo</em></p>
