<p><strong>Chapter 1215: Single-handedly Rocking Blacksoul!</strong></p><p>&#x201C;What gall!!&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;How dare you invade the Blacksoul Society of the Heavengod Alliance! Who are you!?!?&#x201D; Meng Hao heard numerous enraged roars filling his mind that were carried by the incoming streams of divine sense.</p><p>Were he an ordinary cultivator, such a convergence of divine sense would be enough to completely eradicate his mind.</p><p>Instead, he continued to stride forward. Voice cool, he said, &#x201C;Like I said, my name is Meng Hao, and I&#x2019;m here to exterminate this sect!&#x201D;</p><p>When he spoke the final three words, his voice became like Heavenly might, crashing as loud as thunder, causing the combined power of the divine sense around him to instantly shatter like dried twigs!</p><p>RUUUUUUMMMMBLLLLE!</p><p>Countless miserable shrieks could be heard in the distant Blacksoul Society.</p><p>&#x201C;Kill him!&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;A foreigner is invading! Kill him!&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;I&apos;m going to extract his soul and refine it into a flag, then I&#x2019;ll fly that flag in the cold wind of an Arcane Pocket Realm... and let him scream for tens of thousands of years!!&#x201D;</p><p>The sky grew dim, winds screamed, and the land quaked as countless cultivators flew into the air toward Meng Hao. All of them unleashed divine abilities, and in the blink of an eye, the sky was filled with innumerable evil souls, who shot screaming toward Meng Hao.</p><p>Meng Hao&apos;s expression was as calm as ever as he continued to walk forward. He waved his sleeve, and the sky rumbled as a huge fissure opened up directly in the path of the incoming cultivators. Red mist roiled out of the fissure, along with sinister laughter. A huge blood-colored head appeared, and the fissure ripped open wider as something stepped out.</p><p>It was the Blood Demon!</p><p>The Blood Demon roared as it charged forward, transforming into a sea of blood that surged out in all directions. When it reached the cultivators, numerous bloodcurdling screams rang out. Countless evil souls were destroyed, and many of the cultivators began to shake violently. Blood then started spurting out of their eyes, ears, noses, and mouths, and they were rapidly sucked dry.</p><p>Within the bloody mist, a blood spirit appeared. Lacking any emotion, it became a blood shadow which passed about, causing cultivators to scream as they withered away rapidly and then died.</p><p>The cultivators of the Blacksoul Society were known for their cruel techniques, and all of them were the type of people who had slaughtered so many others it was impossible to keep track of how many. They believed themselves to be the most brutal entities in existence. But what they were seeing right now left the Blacksoul Society cultivators astonished.</p><p>When it came to brutality and viciousness, they couldn&#x2019;t even compare at all to the Blood Demon and the blood spirit.</p><p>Meng Hao proceeded onward calmly, waving his hand again to cause numerous Immortal mountains to descend. The rumbling sounds were so intense that it sounded like an apocalypse had arrived to this world.</p><p>&#x201C;How impudent!&#x201D; A cold snort rang out, filled with matchless, awe-inspiring power. The thunderous sound caused the Blood Demon to tremble, the blood spirit to gape in dread, and the Immortal mountains to crumble to pieces.</p><p>As the sound echoed about, pitch-black smoke began to pour out from the vicinity of the black cliff. The smoke converged together into the form of a face, that of a middle-aged man, whose eyes sparkled like lightning as he looked at Meng Hao.</p><p>The Blacksoul Society only had one Dao Realm Patriarch. However, he was no ordinary Dao Realm cultivator. When Meng Hao had seen him by means of Karma Threads, he had been able to determine that he was a 2-Essences Dao Realm expert. However, from the power radiating out now, Meng Hao could tell that this was no 2-Essences expert... this was a 3-Essences Dao Lord!</p><p>He was the one who had called Meng Hao impudent, words which shook everything above and below. In fact, those words apparently could control the spiritual energy of Heaven and Earth, which formed a powerful force of expulsion against Meng Hao!</p><p>Meng Hao&#x2019;s pupils constricted, and his heart sank a bit.</p><p>It was at this point that ten old men flew out to surround the smoke face. When they unleashed their cultivation bases, the shocking power of the great circle of the Ancient Realm exploded out!</p><p>Some of them headed directly toward the Blood Demon and the blood spirit, whereas others shot toward Meng Hao, expressions vicious.</p><p>In addition to this were over a hundred other cultivators in the Ancient Realm, surrounded by Soul Lamps. It was an impressive sight, and as their power spread out, it formed a large spell formation with towering energy that seemed capable of superseding the Heavens.</p><p>More and more cultivators of the Blacksoul Society were flying up to participate in this Dao Realm-level battle!</p><p>This was how powerful a sect could be!</p><p>&#x201C;3-Essences....&#x201D; Meng Hao said coolly. &#x201C;Well, so what? Since I&apos;ve come all this way, I&apos;m going to end things here and now!!&#x201D; He was sure of what he had seen earlier via the Karma Threads. Perhaps there was some factor he had been unaware of, or maybe the man had experienced a breakthrough in these past few days. Regardless of the reason why, Meng Hao was here, and even if he had to fight a 3-Essences expert, he would!</p><p>He took a fourth step, and his energy rocketed up, causing everything to shake dramatically. Some parts of the land even crumbled. At the same time, a roar could be heard from inside Meng Hao&#x2019;s bag of holding. The Blood Mastiff flew out, causing everything around it to shake as its great circle Ancient Realm cultivation base exploded with shocking power.</p><p>There was even a host of shrieking black imps that turned into black beams of light and shot into the crowd.</p><p>Shockingly, Meng Hao was single-handedly rocking the entire Blacksoul Society!</p><p>He didn&#x2019;t give voice to his goal of retrieving Chu Yuyan&#x2019;s soul. That was something he could not reveal, lest he advertise his weak spot. Of course, if they agreed to hand over the soul, he wouldn&#x2019;t be opposed to working out a deal with them, even if it cost him a lot financially.</p><p>But... if they disagreed and became aware of why he&#x2019;d come, it would be incredibly dangerous for Chu Yuyan.</p><p>Therefore, the simplest method... was to exterminate the entire sect and take Chu Yuyan&#x2019;s soul by force!</p><p>Meng Hao radiated a murderous aura that took form in the shape of black shockwave, which shot outward in all directions. Whatever cultivators were hit by it were instantly thrown into mental confusion and insanity.</p><p>At the same time, Meng Hao&#x2019;s Allheaven Dao Immortal cultivation base erupted with power, bolstered by his Seven God Steps. His energy soared higher and higher as he took the fifth of those steps.</p><p>As he did, dozens of Ancient Realm cultivators closed in, joined by six experts in the great circle of the Ancient Realm. They unleashed massive, destructive power that merged together into an enormous Yama Soul that looked like it had just emerged from the underworld. It was clad in black armor, and while it looked human above the waist, from the waist down it had the body of a huge snake. Roaring, it hefted a Yama Weapon and lashed out toward Meng Hao with deadly force.</p><p>It was in that exact moment that Meng Hao&#x2019;s foot touched down with his fifth step, and his energy soared even higher than before. The Heavens trembled and the Earth quaked. Numerous crevices snaked out over the ground, and one mountain after another began to crumble on the planet below.</p><p>In response to his surging energy, his cultivation base caused an explosive tempest to rise up, transforming into a barrier that the Yama Soul collided with. Immediately, the Yama Soul was sent tumbling backward. Unexpectedly... it was completely incapable of doing anything to that barrier.</p><p>It wasn&#x2019;t even necessary to say anything about it attacking Meng Hao; it couldn&#x2019;t even get within 300 meters of him.</p><p>The Yama Soul wasn&#x2019;t the only thing sent tumbling away. The Ancient Realm cultivators all coughed up blood when they were hit by the barrier, and there were even some who exploded into bits. Those who weren&#x2019;t killed in body and soul were heavily wounded as they were shoved backward.</p><p>The cultivators in the great circle of the Ancient Realm looked on with ashen, shocked faces.</p><p>&#x201C;Who are you?!?!&#x201D;</p><p>That was the question uttered as Meng Hao&#x2019;s sixth step landed. His energy once again rocketed up, and his cultivation base expanded, causing the invisible barrier to push from 300 meters to 900. Even more cultivators were affected, including Immortal Realm disciples who were pushed back relentlessly. Many were killed, and the sounds of bloodcurdling screams filled the entire planet. By this point, anyone and everyone could tell that whoever this person was, he was astonishingly powerful!</p><p>&#x201C;Dao Realm! He&#x2019;s in the Dao Realm!!&#x201D; Countless miserable screams could be heard, screams laced with terror. It didn&#x2019;t matter how brutal and fierce these people normally were, their minds were now completely occupied by one thing: fear.</p><p>Their Patriarch might be in the Dao Realm, and considered mighty even among Dao Realm experts. Yet they were still filled with fear. Any Dao Realm expert was the type of person to strike indescribable dread into all hearts.</p><p>Almost in the same moment that people began to cry out, the enormous face formed from black smoke opened its mouth, causing a black wind to seethe out.</p><p>That black wind contained Essence power. Specifically, it was the shocking Essence of wind, and even more shockingly, it was intermixed with countless vicious souls whose howls filled the air. Concealed within the all-encompassing wind, the souls shot toward Meng Hao.</p><p>Now that his power had increased thanks to the sixth step, Meng Hao performed an incantation gesture with his right hand and then pushed it up into the air as if he were going to push the sky up!</p><p>&#x201C;Essence of Divine Flame!&#x201D;</p><p>Rumbling sounds filled the world as every cloud in the sky disintegrated. This Essence was not the color of blood, nor was it black, and not a single soul could be seen within it. What it was filled with... was a boundless sea of flames. The flames roiled outwards and became all-encompassing, causing the temperature in the entire world to rapidly reach a scaldingly terrifying level.</p><p>The sky formed a reservoir for the sea of flames, and the ground became the battlefield. Meng Hao was using the Divine Flame to counter the Soul Wind!</p><p>Essence power erupted out, causing the world to tremble even more violently. Since this was not a true planet, but rather an artificial one moulded together from smaller parts, the Dao Realm pressure currently weighing down on it caused it to show signs of imminent collapse. More and more cracks had spread out over its surface.</p><p>Then... Meng Hao took a seventh step!</p><p>That step caused his will to merge with the will of the Heavens, making him like a deity!</p><p>His energy surged up in an unprecedented fashion. He had never powered up to such heights before, and truth be told, he hadn&#x2019;t even unleashed his Paragon Bridge yet. This was pure cultivation base power, which was terrifying enough to shake the Dao Realm.</p><p>He now began to grow larger; in the blink of an eye, he was like a giant, fully 3,000 meters tall. The sky began to collapse as he clenched his hand into a fist that then rocketed from the battlefield directly toward the smoke-face floating above the black cliff.</p><p>This was none other than the God-Slaying Fist!!</p><p>The face in the smoke looked grave; the feeling of intense crisis it got because of Meng Hao was something that only some of the oldest experts in the Eighth Mountain and Sea could match, something that he hadn&#x2019;t felt in a very, very long time.</p><p>However, he could also tell that this was one of Meng Hao&#x2019;s most powerful attacks, which he was only able to unleash after building up a huge amount of energy. Although the face could fight back against this attack, he didn&#x2019;t see any need to actually do so. All he really had to do was wait for Meng Hao&#x2019;s energy to be spent.</p><p>Eyes flickering coldly, the face suddenly backed up from Meng Hao&#x2019;s fist strike and began to fade away. As it did, an astute gleam appeared in Meng Hao&#x2019;s eyes.</p><p>Just as the face had almost completely faded away, his fist suddenly transformed into a palm, which made a grab for... the incense burner at the base of the black cliff!!</p><p>His primary goal had never been the extermination of the sect as he had loudly proclaimed, but rather... Chu Yuyan&#x2019;s soul! Everything from before had been carefully executed in such a way that, even if his opponent evaded his blow, he would still be able to grab the incense burner.</p><p>Similarly, if the man didn&#x2019;t evade, then Meng Hao was prepared with a follow-up move!</p>
