 <p><strong>Chapter 1268: The Door of the Ancient Realm is Coming!</strong></p><p>In almost the same moment that the eighth bloodline Patriarch conceded, the ninth bloodline Patriarch, the old man who had met Meng Hao before, suddenly roared, raising both hands into the air and then clapping them together viciously.</p><p>&#x201C;Mirror Massacre!&#x201D; he yelled. Almost instantly, the starry sky beneath Meng Hao&#x2019;s feet began to ripple as if with waves. Shockingly, the area beneath him then transformed into a gigantic mirror that reflected everything above it, including Meng Hao and everyone else involved in the fight.</p><p>&#x201C;Eee?&#x201D; said Meng Hao. He had fought with Dao Realm experts a few times, but this was his first time seeing Essence magic in the form of a mirror. He looked down at his reflection in the mirror, and the other version of himself did the same thing. When their eyes met, Meng Hao could suddenly feel a power like that of possession spreading out inside of him.</p><p>At the same time, a bloody glow was closing in on him, within which was the Essence of slaughter. It transformed into a blood-colored blade that slashed down toward Meng Hao. Meng Hao&#x2019;s right hand flashed with an incantation gesture, causing numerous mountains to descend, blocking the blood blade. However, the blood blade blasted through them and a moment later, slashed Meng Hao himself!</p><p>Meng Hao looked down at the wound on his arm, and the blood that oozed out from it; apparently even his restorative powers were incapable of healing the wound.</p><p>&#x201C;Slaughter Essence....&#x201D; he thought with some indifference. Without a moment of hesitation, he suddenly turned and raised his hand to point behind him. Instantly, the more than 1,000 green lightning bolts which had been shooting toward him stopped in place.</p><p>But then, an ancient voice echoed out.</p><p>&#x201C;Detonate!&#x201D;</p><p>BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOMMMM!</p><p>More than 1,000 lightning bolts exploded, inundating Meng Hao. At the same time, a red blade of light shot up from within the mirror down below, slashing toward Meng Hao with an air of blood and slaughter.</p><p>At the same time, the over 1,000 bolts of green lighting in the mirror also exploded; apparently the mirror was a type of magic that could cause wounds to double in severity. Meng Hao was surrounded by explosions.</p><p>The three Patriarchs who were still in the fight were staring at Meng Hao with serious expressions, having been deeply moved by his display of power.</p><p>The three old men exchanged glances, and then one said, &#x201C;Even if that didn&#x2019;t kill him, at least it should have seriously injured him....&#x201D;</p><p>But then their faces fell as Meng Hao&#x2019;s cold voice rang out from within the green lightning. &#x201C;Well, isn&#x2019;t this interesting.&#x201D;</p><p>A figure flashed through the void toward the ninth bloodline Patriarch. The old man&#x2019;s face flickered, and he bit his tongue, spitting up a mouthful of blood.</p><p>&#x201C;Second Mirror!&#x201D; he cried. Another huge mirror appeared in the void, directly in Meng Hao&#x2019;s path. When he flew into the mirror, he actually emerged from the location of the first mirror.</p><p>As he did, the other two Patriarchs unleashed simultaneous attacks. The blood blade turned into a blood sea, and the green lightning became lightning chains, which shot out toward Meng Hao.</p><p>&#x201C;Third Mirror!&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Fourth Mirror!&#x201D; As the ninth bloodline Patriarch roared, blood oozed out of his eyes, ears, nose, and mouth. Four mirrors was his limit, and as he unleashed the magic, more attacks shot out from them.</p><p>The appearance of these mirrors caused the power of the various Daoist magics aimed at Meng Hao to increase dramatically. A boundless blood sea and seemingly infinite green chains rumbled through the starry sky toward Meng Hao.</p><p>Down in the Meng Clan ancestral mansion, all of the clan members were watching excitedly. As for Grandma Meng, her eyes were filled with concern.</p><p>Just in the moment when all the other members of the Meng Clan seemed so excited, an intense rumbling sound echoed out from inside Meng Hao.</p><p>&#x201C;Nice. What a useful Daoist magic you have there!&#x201D; he said, sounding very enthusiastic. Suddenly, he began to radiate cultivation base power.</p><p>Astonishingly, he hadn&#x2019;t been using his cultivation base at all in the fight; he had relied only on his fleshly body strength. But now he called upon the power of an Allheaven Dao Immortal. His energy rose up to towering heights, causing the blood sea to evaporate and the lightning chains to shatter.</p><p>At the same time, Meng Hao&#x2019;s drawing upon the power of an Allheaven Dao Immortal caused him to experience the sensation that the Door of the Ancient Realm was coming. Although no one else could sense it, he fully understood what was happening.</p><p>The arrival of the Door of the Ancient Realm was imminent. He didn&#x2019;t need to call it; it could descend on its own at any time!</p><p>Meng Hao&#x2019;s expression was calm as he strode forward, waving his finger, a motion that caused his Allheaven Dao Immortal power to erupt out, and his four Nirvana Fruits began to rotate inside of him. That wave of a finger seemed capable of shattering the Mountain and Sea Realm. When it landed on the mirror, cracking sounds rang out, and fissures spread out all over its surface. Then it simply shattered.</p><p>When the first mirror shattered, the ninth bloodline Patriarch coughed up a mouthful of blood. Then Meng Hao waved his finger again, causing the second mirror to explode.</p><p>Then he waved his finger a third and a fourth time!</p><p>The third and fourth mirrors both shattered into fragments. The ninth bloodline Patriarch coughed up more blood, and his body withered. When they had first met, this man had acted completely arrogant, but now he was shivering, and his scalp was numb as he cried, &#x201C;I concede!&#x201D;</p><p>In almost the same moment that the two words left the man&#x2019;s mouth, the void in front of him crumbled, only a few meters away from his position. That area emanated a powerful will of destruction, and the ninth bloodline Patriarch knew that if he had been any slower in conceding, the collapse would have reached him.</p><p>The mere thought of that caused him to gasp.</p><p>&#x201C;His gaze. That happened merely from his gaze.... His cultivation base is definitely similar to that of a Dao Sovereign. But how come I can&apos;t sense much Essence on him...?&#x201D;</p><p>Even as the ninth bloodline Patriarch conceded, Meng Hao turned and waved his hand toward the Patriarch proficient with the Essences of blood and slaughter. Instantly, the starry sky began to shatter as a rift opened up and the Blood Demon emerged. It threw its head back and roared, which made everyone feel as if the blood in their own bodies had gone out of control. The Blood Demon then charged the Dao Realm Patriarch, emanating brutality, madness, and a thirst for blood.</p><p>The slaughter Essence Patriarch&#x2019;s face fell. However, instead of retreating, he suddenly shot forward to fight the Blood Demon. Meng Hao gave a cold snort, appearing suddenly in front of the Blood Demon, whereupon he unleashed a punch.</p><p>It was none other than the Life-Extermination Fist!</p><p>As the fist flew out, the Dao Realm Patriarch&#x2019;s face fell. He wanted to retreat, but had no time. The starry sky trembled, and blood sprayed out of the Patriarch&#x2019;s mouth. It was only then that he fell back, face filled with astonishment and terror. However, he wasn&#x2019;t giving up. As he retreated, his hands flashed in a double-handed incantation gesture, causing nine coffins to fly out of his bag of holding, all of which emanated a sinister, cold air. At the same time, a funeral garland appeared in his hand, filled with blood-colored flowers!</p><p>&#x201C;Using magical items and a puppet, huh?&#x201D; Meng Hao asked, looking over at the man.</p><p>&#x201C;There were never any rules that said we couldn&apos;t use magical items,&#x201D; the Patriarch replied, his eyes flickering coldly.</p><p>It was at this point that the strongest of the five Patriarchs, the one with four Essences, opened his mouth and spit out a green trident. Instantly, the starry sky trembled, and countless bolts of green lightning began to converge on him. Soon, he was shining a bright green color, which, in addition to the green lightning, made him look like an actual green lightning bolt. He hefted the trident and was just about to charge Meng Hao, when a long spear suddenly appeared in Meng Hao&#x2019;s hand. The spear looked like a dragon, and emanated a terrifying aura that caused the void to vibrate and even shatter. This was clearly a precious treasure!</p><p>Even more shocking was that as soon as the long spear appeared, the funeral garland in the hand of the slaughter Essence Patriarch began to shake. Then, the blood-colored flower petals began to wilt and dry up!</p><p>As for the nine coffins, they emanated strange droning sounds that seemed to be some sort of language. As soon as the Patriarch heard those voices, his face fell.</p><p>Things weren&#x2019;t over yet, though. The trident held by the nearly-4-Essences Patriarch almost seemed scared, as if an incredibly powerful enemy had suddenly appeared. The Patriarch&apos;s face flickered, and his heart began to thump.</p><p>This spear which could cow other treasures was none other than the weapon which Greed had unsealed. If it was the type of weapon that Greed would think was an incredible treasure, then obviously it wouldn&apos;t be weak.</p><p>&#x201C;Since you&#x2019;re using magical items, then I guess I&#x2019;ll use one of mine,&#x201D; Meng Hao said coolly. &quot;I happened to meet a kind-hearted person who helped unseal this spear for me. I still haven&#x2019;t had a chance to get used to it, so I&apos;m not sure if I can fully control it. Are you two sure you want to keep fighting?&#x201D;</p><p>He was now convinced that his battle prowess was enough to be able to fight a 4-Essences Dao Sovereign. However, as for whether or not he could fight five Essences, that was a different matter.</p><p>As soon as the words left his mouth, the remaining two Patriarchs&#x2019; faces turned very unsightly. They didn&#x2019;t believe at all what Meng Hao said about a kind-hearted individual unsealing the spear, especially one powerful enough to make their own treasures wither and tremble as if facing some arch-nemesis treasure. Who would believe that a person would voluntarily refine such a treasure for someone else? The more they thought about it, the more Meng Hao&#x2019;s line about the kind-hearted individual seemed like complete nonsense.</p><p>Besides, if kind-hearted individuals like that really existed, why had they never run into one...?</p><p>To them, Meng Hao was using those words as an excuse. An excuse... to be able to kill them under the guise of stumbling in battle!</p><p>&#x201C;I concede!&#x201D; said the Patriarch adept with slaughter Essence. Gritting his teeth, he waved his hand, causing the coffins and the funeral garland to vanish.</p><p>The nearly-4-Essences Patriarch chuckled bitterly. The green glow faded, and he put his trident away. Then he clasped hands and bowed.</p><p>&#x201C;I also concede,&#x201D; he said, looking at Meng Hao with a smile. &#x201C;We&apos;re all from the same clan, so there&#x2019;s no need to fight to the death. As for the tenth bloodline... I admit that they are the primary bloodline, and promise to support them. What do you say, young friend. Do you agree to end things here?&#x201D;</p><p>Meng Hao didn&#x2019;t respond. Instead, he looked up into the starry sky, a gleam of anticipation in his eyes....</p><p>Simultaneously, the five Dao Realm Patriarchs all looked up in shock.</p><p>The Door of the Ancient Realm was coming!</p><p></p><hr><p></p>
