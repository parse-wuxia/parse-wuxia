<p><strong>Chapter 1422: Leave My Mark!</strong></p><p>As soon as the Sixth Paragon spoke, coldness spread out in all directions. It wasn&#x2019;t frost, but rather was something that cut off the area from the outside. Beyond that barrier, Meng Hao&#x2019;s two subordinates, the 8-Essences Paragons, were shocked. Moments ago, they had been speeding forward, but now they were being pushed back.</p><p>It was as if some powerful repelling force had grabbed them, and even as they attempted to push forward, was pulling them backward. The result was that they felt like they were being ripped into pieces.</p><p>Their souls and their bodies seemed to be on the verge of separating, and the void around them looked as if it were about to be torn apart. Rumbling sounds filled the air, and blood sprayed out of their mouths. Xin Yue&#x2019;s eyes glittered coldly, and as for Su Yi, her expression was one of anger, and she let out a roar as she attempted to force her way forward.</p><p>These two were proud women, and to be disgraced in front of the Ninth Paragon was unacceptable. If Meng Hao himself did this to them, maybe they could accept it, but from anyone other than the Ninth Paragon, it was treatment they could never put up with.</p><p>&#x201C;You think a bit too much of yourselves,&#x201D; the Sixth Paragon said with a cold snort, raising his right hand. However, in that very moment, an aura filled with infinitely colder killing intent exploded out from Meng Hao on the ninth altar.</p><p>&#x201C;Those are my people,&#x201D; he said as he began to stride forward. Each step caused thunderous booms to ring out. At the same time, intense power erupted out from his head, transforming into a vortex that spread out rapidly. Colors flashed and the wind screamed, and in that same moment, he appeared in front of the Sixth Paragon and unleashed a fist strike.</p><p>He didn&apos;t need any divine abilities to deal with this Sixth Paragon. He used his most direct method, punching. Everything shook as Meng Hao&#x2019;s fist rocketed out, seemingly a black hole that caused the starry sky inside of the half-planet to tremble, and the lands around them to quake. It was as if this fist strike were backed by the power of this starry sky itself.</p><p>The Sixth Paragon&apos;s eyes widened, and he extended his right hand to meet the fist strike.</p><p>BOOOOOOOOOMMM!</p><p>As the fist strike landed, Meng Hao touched down onto the sixth altar, where he stood completely unmoving. The Sixth Paragon looked like he was standing in the middle of a violent windstorm; his hair and clothing whipped about, and he was trembling visibly. All of his skin which was visible seemed to sink into itself.</p><p>As the boom continued to echo out, the Sixth Paragon coughed up a mouthful of blood and staggered backward uncontrollably. When he came to a stop about thirty meters back, he forced himself to hold in the next mouthful of blood that he had been about to cough up, and then looked up, a vicious expression on his face. Roaring in anger, he spread his arms wide, and a massive eruption of Essence power occurred. An enormous, amorphous blade formed which seemed capable of slashing through anything and everything.</p><p>&#x201C;Old Ninth,&#x201D; he yelled, &#x201C;are you looking to die?&#x201D; The other Paragons were simply watching the events unfold, strange gleams flickering in their eyes. Meng Hao&apos;s fist strike just now had been shocking to behold, and yet none of them had done anything to interfere. As for the Sect Leader, he frowned and then looked over at the Sixth Paragon with an expression of displeasure.</p><p>Almost as soon as the Sixth Paragon spoke again, Meng Hao waved his right hand, causing a powerful force to explode out. A windstorm formed, which smashed a hole into the tunnel being created by the teleportation power. That in turn allowed his subordinates to enter.</p><p>His two subordinates looked very shaken, although Su Yi took everything in a bit easier. This was actually her second time seeing Meng Hao fight, as she had been observing when he dealt with the Black Dragon earlier.</p><p>As for Xin Yue, this was her first time seeing Meng Hao in action, and it caused waves of shock to pound at her heart. His shocking fist strike seemed capable of destroying an entire world, and left her panting.</p><p>As for the hole he had opened to let them in, it seemed to have been made in an almost casual fashion. Both of the women could only gasp in response. Without any hesitation, they flew into the area with the altars to appear standing next to Meng Hao.</p><p>&#x201C;Greetings, Paragon, we arrived late,&#x201D; they said, clasped hands and bowing.</p><p>&#x201C;I decide whether you&#x2019;re late or not....&#x201D; he said coolly. Then he strode forward to once again stand directly in front of the Sixth Paragon. &#x201C;It has absolutely nothing to do with you, Sixth Paragon. Do you think I need you punishing my subordinates? Do I look like I need your help? Who the hell do you think you are?! I think I need to leave my mark on you to help you remember what happened here today.&#x201D;</p><p>As Meng Hao spoke, the Sixth Paragon&#x2019;s eyes flickered with killing intent. He waved his arms, sending Essence power exploding out, which transformed into a huge pitch-black head.</p><p>Seeing that the two of them were about to start fighting, Shangguan Hong stepped forward. With him were three other Paragons, who stood between Meng Hao and the Sixth Paragon.</p><p>&#x201C;Old Ninth, just forget about what happened.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Old Sixth, you&#x2019;re in the wrong here.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Just forget about all of this. We&apos;re supposed to be on our way to the necropolis. Just cool down for now. If you really have so much energy to spare you can put it into getting into the necropolis.&#x201D;</p><p>A flicker of hatred passed through the Sixth Paragon&#x2019;s eyes, and despite the interference of the other Paragons, he pointed out with both fingers, causing the pitch-black head to roar as it closed in on Meng Hao.</p><p>Shangguan Hong and the others looked on with flickering expressions, but before they could do anything, Meng Hao suddenly stepped forward. In the blink of an eye, an azure roc appeared, which then slammed into the pitch-black head.</p><p>A boom rang out as the pitch black head of Essence collapsed. Meng Hao in azure roc-form then became a beam of azure light that shot directly toward the Sixth Paragon.</p><p>The Sixth Paragon&#x2019;s face fell, and he was just about to fall back when a fist shot out from the light and slammed into his chest.</p><p>The Sixth Paragon was knocked completely off of the altar, blood spraying out of his mouth the entire time. Before he could even react, green light flickered, and Meng Hao was on him again, unleashing another fist strike.</p><p>Then a third, a fourth, and a fifth!</p><p>Booms rang out as the Sixth Paragon was shoved backward over and over again. His chest was caving in, and he screamed miserably. His three 8-Essences Paragon subordinates hesitated, but realized that they had little choice other than to fly out to try to stop Meng Hao.</p><p>But then Su Yi and Xin Yue stepped forward to stop them.</p><p>&#x201C;Scram!&#x201D; Before the two groups could meet up, Meng Hao snorted coldly from within the azure light. He then appeared in bodily form and waved his sleeve, causing Divine Flame to blaze out toward the Sixth Paragon&#x2019;s three subordinates. Their faces fell, but they were incapable of evading, and were sent tumbling back 3,000 meters, blood spraying out of their mouths.</p><p>As for the Sixth Paragon, he was completely shaken. How could he ever have imagined that Meng Hao would be so incredibly powerful?</p><p>He was being attacked so viciously he could do nothing but retreat, and didn&apos;t even have a chance to fight back. He didn&#x2019;t get the feeling he wasn&#x2019;t a match for Meng Hao, but rather that he had lost the initiative and had no chance to actually fight back.</p><p>By now, regret was building up in his heart, and he wished hadn&apos;t made an attempt to test Meng Hao.</p><p>&#x201C;Dammit!!&#x201D; he roared as Meng Hao closed in again. Booming sounds rang out as he sent out divine abilities, only for them to be instantly destroyed. Next came some magical items. They didn&#x2019;t last any longer than the divine abilities.</p><p>The other Paragons watched what was happening with strange, thoughtful gleams in their eyes. As of this point, they were starting to gain an understanding of just how powerful Meng Hao was.</p><p>And that was exactly what Meng Hao wanted; to establish himself!</p><p>Coldness flickered in his eyes as he raised his right hand again. Shockingly, the power of space could be detected, slowly building up in power; it was none other that the Eighth Hex&#x2019;s Essence of space, of which he had gained enlightenment.</p><p>When the Sect Leader saw what was happening, his pupils constricted; he took a step forward and waved his sleeve.</p><p>&#x201C;Enough! How far do you plan to take this fight?!&#x201D;</p><p>The Sect Leader was at the peak of the 9-Essences level, so the wave of his arm caused an incredible force to build up between Meng Hao and the Sixth Paragon, shoving them apart.</p><p>The Sixth Paragon actually breathed a sigh of relief at being given a way out of the situation. He looked over at Meng Hao with killing intent flickering in his eyes.</p><p>Unfortunately for him, he was still underestimating Meng Hao!</p><p>&#x201C;Like I said, I need to leave my mark on you.&#x201D; Even as his cold voice rang out, the Dao eye on his forehead opened up, and a boundless will erupted out. The entire starry sky shook, and all minds began to reel.</p><p>In that instant, the power of the Dao eye caused the divine ability just unleashed by the Sect Leader to be frozen in place in front of Meng Hao. Meng Hao then shot forward at a speed far surpassing anything from before.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, he was right in front of the Sixth Paragon. The Sixth Paragon&#x2019;s mind was spinning, and wanted to fall back, but felt as if he were stuck in mud; he was simply too slow. His pupils constricted as astonishment filled his eyes.</p><p>The Sect Leader&#x2019;s face fell, and he bellowed, &#x201C;Old Ninth, stay your hand!&#x201D;</p><p>He took a step forward to appear next to Meng Hao, whereupon he flicked his sleeve. That motion blocked Meng Hao&#x2019;s hands and feet, and was just about to pull him away, when Meng Hao grinned. His aura changed, and a brutal air erupted out of him. Although his hands and feet had been immobilized, his head had not!</p><p>He stretched his head out and bit down viciously onto the Sixth Paragon&#x2019;s neck, ripping out a huge chunk of bloody flesh.</p><p>Blood sprayed out of the Sixth Paragon&#x2019;s neck, and he screamed. He clamped his hand down onto his neck and shot backward. By now, there was no killing intent in his eyes toward Meng Hao, only intense astonishment.</p><p>Of all the people he had fought in his life, this was the most brutal person he had ever encountered. He actually bit a chunk of flesh out of him! As far as he was concerned, this Ninth Paragon was completely mad.</p><p>Meng Hao calmly swallowed the chunk of flesh and then said, &#x201C;That&#x2019;s my mark.&#x201D;</p><p>Then he wiped his mouth and walked back to the ninth altar. As he did, the surrounding cultivators watched him, their minds reeling. Even Su Yi and Xin Yue were left gasping.</p><p>They would never be able to forget the brutal display put on by Meng Hao this day.</p><p>&#x201C;This guy... should never be provoked!&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Crazy! He&#x2019;s completely insane....&#x201D; The Paragons were left gasping, looks of intense vigilance on their faces.</p><p>The Sect Leader&#x2019;s face was extremely unsightly, and his mind was being battered by waves of shock. He stared at Meng Hao, and then looked over angrily at the Sixth Paragon. Finally, he headed back to the first altar, his face very grim.</p><p>The Sixth Paragon silently returned to his altar, his face pale, terror gleaming in his eyes as he looked over at Meng Hao.</p><p>He wasn&#x2019;t afraid of cultivators with a higher cultivation base, but rather those who were completely insane. And Meng Hao was the most insane person he had ever encountered among 9-Essences cultivators.</p><p>Meng Hao&#x2019;s expression was the same as ever as he stood there, hands clasped behind his back as if nothing had happened. Behind him, Su Yi and Xin Yue looked at him with awe in their eyes.</p><p>A moment later, the teleportation power was unleashed, and rumbling could be heard as a pillar of light rose into the air, and they all vanished.</p><p></p><hr><p></p>
