<p><strong>Chapter 1157: I Won&#x2019;t Buy It!</strong></p><p>To most of the people present, a jade medallion like the one in question might be worth 20-30,000,000 spirit stones at most. Since one Immortal jade was worth 10,000 spirits stones, that put its value at a few thousand Immortal jades at most, and definitely less than 10,000.</p><p>However, Guru Heavenwind had just mentioned 10,000,000 Immortal jades, a sum equal to 100,000,000,000 spirit stones....</p><p>It was difficult to imagine or even describe that much wealth. It would be an extraordinary sum to even an entire sect or clan. As for the Heavencloud Bazaar... it would take hundreds or perhaps thousands of years to accumulate 10,000,000 Immortal jades.</p><p>For him to demand such a price... was equivalent of bald-faced robbery.</p><p>Everyone in the audience gasped in response to what was happening. They were both shaken by Guru Heavenwind&#x2019;s words, and also astonished at Meng Hao&#x2019;s display of wealth.</p><p>&#x201C;10,000,000 Immortal jades and you can have the medallion!&#x201D; Guru Heavenwind said. &#x201C;Otherwise, it belongs to the Heavencloud Bazaar, and it&#x2019;s none of your business what we do with it, even if we crush it to bits!&#x201D; Guru Heavenwind&#x2019;s eyes were completely bloodshot. He knew who Meng Hao actually was, and if the sum involved was less than 1,000,000 Immortal jades, then after mulling it over, he would likely have held back from doing anything to offend him. However, the amount of wealth involved pushed him to the point where he didn&apos;t care about who Meng Hao was.</p><p>Wealth can drive people crazy, can make them lose their minds, especially when combined with strong desire. To Guru Heavenwind, 10,000,000 Immortal jades was worth risking his life for. Considering he had reached this decision, it was obvious that he had passed the point of considering whether or not it was worth it to offend Meng Hao, and had chosen to actually threaten him!</p><p>In fact, he no longer even cared about the Heavencloud Bazaar as a whole. From his perspective, if he could get his hands on that much money, he could flee to the furthest corners of the universe. Furthermore, he was sure that even if his Elder Brother came out of secluded meditation, he would be so moved by the amount of money involved that he would not interfere. After all, Guru Heavenwind knew Guru Heavencloud better than anyone else.</p><p>&#x201C;Today, he&#x2019;ll buy this thing... whether he wants to or not!&#x201D; he thought. His four red-robed followers were all panting the same as him as they joined in to intercept Meng Hao.</p><p>Meng Hao hovered in midair, staring at Guru Heavenwind, his face turning cold.</p><p>&#x201C;You shameless old fart!&#x201D; he said with a cold snort. &#x201C;I offered 1,000,000 Immortal jades, yet you won&#x2019;t accept? Fine... I won&#x2019;t buy it!&#x201D; He looked over at the auctioneer, who was rushing to leave. Being in no mood to pay any heed to Guru Heavenwind, his body suddenly flickered. He moved with such speed that Guru Heavenwind and his four red-robed followers saw nothing but a blur. Then, a moment later, Meng Hao was behind them, speeding forward to appear on the main stage, right in front of the auctioneer.</p><p>&#x201C;Give that to me!&#x201D; he said, stretching his hand out. Trembling, the auctioneer unhesitatingly threw the jade medallion toward Meng Hao and then fled, unwilling to be involved in the chaos.</p><p>Guru Heavenwind&#x2019;s face fell. &#x201C;Meng Hao, what are you doing!?&#x201D; he roared, speeding directly toward Meng Hao, eyes flashing with killing intent, energy surging.</p><p>&#x201C;What am I doing? Are you blind?&#x201D; Meng Hao replied coldly. &#x201C;Can&#x2019;t you see that I&apos;m robbing you!?&#x201D; He made a grasping motion with this left hand, and the jade medallion flew toward him. As soon as it landed in his palm, he put it into his bag of holding.</p><p>The eyes of every member of the audience went wide, especially in response to Meng Hao&#x2019;s thunderous words that echoed out in all directions.</p><p>This was their first time ever hearing someone talk about robbing others with such confidence, as if it were the most righteous and proper thing to do.</p><p>Guru Heavenwind&#x2019;s rage towered into the sky. As he and his four red-robed followers closed in on Meng Hao, they extended their hands to unleash divine abilities and magical techniques that combined to form a pagoda of magical treasures, which then smashed down toward Meng Hao.</p><p>&#x201C;Meng Hao, how dare you throw a temper tantrum here!&#x201D; Guru Heavenwind raged.</p><p>Meng Hao stood in place, neither dodging nor evading. His eyes flickered with coldness, and he waved his right hand, causing his cultivation base to erupt with power. A massive blast of force exploded out in front of him.</p><p>Rumbling echoed out, and Guru Heavenwind&#x2019;s face fell. The pagoda trembled for a moment, and cracks spread out across its surface. Then it simply exploded, as if some giant, invisible hand had crushed it to pieces.</p><p>The crushed pagoda transformed into countless chunks of ash which then shot backward in a backlash attack, rushing toward Guru Heavenwind, whose face fell as he realized he was facing a power that he couldn&apos;t fight back against. A sensation of deadly crisis instantly filled his mind.</p><p>&#x201C;Impossible!!&#x201D; Guru Heavenwind was completely astonished. He was in the late Ancient Realm, and in the Ninth Mountain and Sea as a whole, could be considered a powerful and important figure. And yet, when facing Meng Hao, he was filled with terror.</p><p>Earlier, he hadn&#x2019;t been able to see through everything about Meng Hao, although he did know that he was a mere Immortal Realm cultivator with the backing of a large clan. But now Meng Hao seemed incredibly powerful and even... almighty!</p><p>He was so strong that Guru Heavenwind could barely evade his attack. Furthermore, even his cultivation base had been thrown into chaos. Meng Hao made his eyes go wide and his entire body tremble. His heart was pounding so hard it seemed like it might simply stop beating.</p><p>He had never felt such intense pressure, not even from his Elder Brother Guru Heavencloud. Blood sprayed out of his mouth as he fell back at top speed.</p><p>He just barely managed to evade the main force of the blow. Unfortunately for the red-robed cultivators, they were not qualified to do so. A boom rang out, and blood sprayed out of their mouths. It was as if a wind of destruction swept across them, shredding their flesh and blood, turning the wind into a haze of red that left behind only their skeletons.</p><p>The skeletons remained for only a single extra breath of time before they became ash. Even their souls were completely wiped away.</p><p>Everything happened too quickly. With the simple wave of a hand, Meng Hao killed four Immortal Realm cultivators and seriously injured Guru Heavenwind. The surrounding cultivators gasped in shock, then looked over at Meng Hao with expressions of disbelief.</p><p>&#x201C;This... this....&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;What cultivation base does he have? He actually forced Guru Heavenwind into retreat!!&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;But from the look of it, he&#x2019;s clearly in the Immortal Realm....&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Guru Heavenwind just called him Meng Hao... Meng Hao.... I remember! He&#x2019;s Meng Hao, Crown Prince of the Fang Clan!! He&apos;s the sole joint disciple of all of the Three Great Daoist Societies! B-but... how could he be so strong!?!?&#x201D;</p><p>Everyone was in an uproar.</p><p>Guru Heavenwind&#x2019;s heart trembled as he came to the realization that he was simply incapable of fighting Meng Hao alone. Although his cultivation base appeared to be in the Immortal Realm, after he attacked, Guru Heavenwind could see that he was far, far stronger than he appeared.</p><p>Even as he fell back, blood oozing from the corners of his mouth, he suddenly roared: &#x201C;All disciples of the Heavencloud Bazaar, hear my command. Kill this man at all costs!!&#x201D;</p><p>The surrounding magenta-robed cultivators hesitated. Then, a few mustered their courage, roared, and charged Meng Hao.</p><p>Guru Heavenwind took advantage of this opportunity to attempt to escape.</p><p>With a cold harrumph, Meng Hao began to advance. When the magenta-robed cultivators tried to block his way, he said, &#x201C;Screw off!&#x201D;</p><p>His voice echoed like thunderclaps, slamming into the cultivators&#x2019; ears, causing their minds to reel and their cultivation bases to become unstable. Vision swimming, their minds went blank momentarily.</p><p>As for Guru Heavenwind, the words caused blood to spray out of his mouth, and he pushed himself faster as he fled.</p><p>&#x201C;Damnation! How could he be so strong!?!?&#x201D; His face was deathly white, and his heart overflowed with regret. Sweat poured down his face as he realized that, considering how viciously he had offended Meng Hao, there was no way that he would let him go.</p><p>Meng Hao sped through the air in an azure beam of light that transformed into an azure roc. An explosive wind kicked up as the distance between him and Guru Heavenwind was reduced from a few hundred meters to less than thirty.</p><p>&#x201C;Elder Brother, save me!!&#x201D; Guru Heavenwind cried shrilly. By now, his heart was filled with terror.</p><p>The entire Heavencloud Bazaar had been thrown into chaos. When the cultivators heard Meng Hao exploding into action, and then Guru Heavenwind screaming for help, they were shocked to the core.</p><p>Everyone in the shops and stalls where Meng Hao had shopped could see what was happening. They were shocked to hear who he was, but were even more shocked to discover that, not only did he have an incredible background, he was also terrifying in terms of cultivation base.</p><p>Of course, what they knew now was only the tip of the iceberg. If they knew that the Fang Clan was now an Allheaven Clan, and that Meng Hao was the true Patriarch of that clan, then their shock would reach a level that would be impossible to describe.</p><p>By now, the cultivators manning the various teleportation portals in the asteroid field had sensed the chaos erupting in the bazaar. Many of them were now flying over to see what was happening.</p><p>At about that time, Meng Hao in azure roc form appeared in front of Guru Heavenwind and slashed out with razor-sharp claws.</p><p>However, even as he did, a cold and sinister voice echoed out through the bazaar, filled with power, dissatisfaction, and rage.</p><p>&#x201C;Harm him not, lad. I can provide an explanation for everything!&#x201D; Along with the voice came a beam of sword light, bursting with killing intent. It transformed into a waterfall-like stream that surged toward Meng Hao.</p><p>It was almost as though... if Meng Hao dared to continue his attack, the waterfall would slash him to pieces!</p><p>The words implied a discussion was to be had, but from the type of attack being leveled against Meng Hao, it was clear exactly how domineering the true lord of the Heavencloud Bazaar was. This was Guru Heavencloud, who was domineering to the extreme!</p><p>However, when people tried to be domineering in front of Meng Hao&#x2026; then, he would be even MORE domineering!</p>
