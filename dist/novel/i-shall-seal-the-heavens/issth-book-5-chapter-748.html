<p><strong></strong></p><p>[/expand]</p><p>An ancient voice echoed out from Mount Blood Demon.</p><p>&#x201C;It&#x2019;s time to end this war.&#x201D;</p><p>Apart from the Blood Demon Sect disciples, everyone on the battlefield was immediately rooted in place.</p><p>Even the false Immortal puppet controlled by the black-robed Patriarch, which had been bearing down on Meng Hao, was stopped in midair.</p><p>The red-haired old man from the Golden Frost Sect, the 3rd Li Clan Patriarch, even the Dawn Immortal&#x2019;s clone, all were frozen in place. They could not move, but they could still think, and their minds&#x2026; were filled with astonishment!</p><p>&#x201C;The fact that you were able to push me this far shows that I truly did underestimate you Southern Domain cultivators,&#x201D; said the ancient voice. It sounded incredibly tired, yet at the same time, filled with a mighty and wild pride.</p><p>&#x201C;Dawn Immortal, earlier you asked me why I was so confident. Well now I&#x2019;m going to show you&#x2026; exactly why I am so confident.</p><p>&#x201C;You all believe that what sits in the Immortal&#x2019;s cave in Mount Blood Demon is actually my true self?&#x201D; Even as the voice boomed out, Patriarch Blood Demon slowly rose from his cross-legged position in the Blood Pond. He stepped forward and then&#x2026; walked out of the Immortal&#x2019;s cave on Mount Blood Demon.</p><p>As he stepped foot onto the mountain peak, a sea of blood burst out from behind him. It truly was a sea, vast quantities of blood that surged up into the sky. In the blink of an eye, it covered everything, so that everything up above&#x2026; was the color of blood.</p><p>The previous sky was no longer visible, making the entire world seem to be one of blood. Within this world of blood, atop Mount Blood Demon, stood Patriarch Blood Demon, clad in armor, looking out at the world with ancient eyes.</p><p>[caption id=&quot;attachment_65649&quot; align=&quot;aligncenter&quot; width=&quot;500&quot;]<a href="www.wuxiaworld.com"><img data-cfsrc="http://www.wuxiaworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/patriarch-blood-demon.jpg" alt="patriarch blood demon art" width="500" height="750" class="size-full wp-image-65649" style="display:none;visibility:hidden;"><noscript><img src="http://www.wuxiaworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/patriarch-blood-demon.jpg" alt="patriarch blood demon art" width="500" height="750" class="size-full wp-image-65649"></noscript></a> Official ISSTH art of Patriarch Blood Demon[/caption]</p><p>[caption id=&quot;attachment_65654&quot; align=&quot;aligncenter&quot; width=&quot;340&quot;]<a href="www.wuxiaworld.com"><img data-cfsrc="http://www.wuxiaworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/cute-patriarch-blood-demon-1.jpg" alt="Official ISSTH &quot;cute&quot; Patriarch Blood Demon art" width="340" height="409" class="size-full wp-image-65654" style="display:none;visibility:hidden;"><noscript><img src="http://www.wuxiaworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/cute-patriarch-blood-demon-1.jpg" alt="Official ISSTH &quot;cute&quot; Patriarch Blood Demon art" width="340" height="409" class="size-full wp-image-65654"></noscript></a> Official ISSTH &quot;cute&quot; Patriarch Blood Demon art[/caption]</p><p>The red-haired Patriarch from the Golden Frost Sect trembled, and an intense apprehension welled up inside of him.</p><p>The 3rd Li Clan Patriarch was equally astonished, and an unprecedented feeling of crisis filled him.</p><p>The Dawn Immortal&#x2019;s clone wore an expression of astonishment as she suddenly realized that her understanding of Patriarch Blood Demon&#x2026; was far from complete.</p><p>The false Immortal puppet controlled by the black-robed Patriarch was also shaking. The massive pressure which weighed down on him was such that he knew a mere thought could kill him!</p><p>&#x201C;Impossible! How could he be so powerful!?!?&#x201D;</p><p>Down below on the battlefield, the more than 100,000 cultivators of the allied powers were also dumbfounded.</p><p>&#x201C;There are many stories about me in the lands of the Southern Domain,&#x201D; said Patriarch Blood Demon coolly. &#x201C;According to some of those stories, I am the incarnation of a drop of blood from a Demon. That is why&#x2026; I am called Patriarch Blood Demon.</p><p>&#x201C;That story is true.&#x201D; He stood there atop Mount Blood Demon, not even the tiniest ripple emanating from his cultivation base. He seemed, for all intents and purposes, to be a mortal.</p><p>&#x201C;And yet, it is also false!&#x201D; When he said this, the land began to quake. Fissures spread out, as if some enormous creature were waking beneath the surface of the land and was about to emerge.</p><p>&#x201C;I say it&#x2019;s true because I am indeed incarnated from a drop of blood. I say it&#x2019;s false because this body formed by the drop of blood&#x2026; is not my true self!&#x201D;</p><p>Rumbling sounds could be heard as the rifts in the land grew larger. However, the cultivators were completely stuck in their original positions. Even if the land fell away beneath them, they would remain floating there in place.</p><p>As for the Blood Demon Sect disciples, they had already retreated back to the region of the five mountain peaks. Meng Hao was among their number, his mind reeling as he held Xu Qing tight at his side.</p><p>Xu Qing&#x2019;s eyes had opened and she was also looking on with shock.</p><p>&#x201C;My confidence lies in my true self. I don&#x2019;t have much life left in me, so I didn&#x2019;t want to move&#x2026;. However, this battle has earned you the right to see me.&#x201D; Even as the words began to leave his mouth, an intense rumbling could be heard from the ground.</p><p>Everything shook as, shockingly, a gargantuan hand burst out from the ground. It was followed by an arm that was thousands of meters long. It looked like a mountain as it rose up, causing everything to tremble.</p><p>The surface of the ground collapsed as a head appeared. He had blood-colored skin, and a horn protruded from his forehead. He wore an ancient, dilapidated suit of armor. It only took a moment&#x2026; for him to completely rise up from the ground!</p><p>He was nearly thirty thousand meters tall, completely crimson, and covered with innumerable complex magical symbols.</p><p>He looked almost exactly like the Demonic Incarnation of the Blood Demon Grand Spell Formation that Meng Hao had controlled before, only more ancient and more real!</p><p>The red-haired old man from the Golden Frost Sect felt his mind buzzing. His face fell, and he began to pant. Next to him, the Li Clan Patriarch gasped, and his eyes went wide with disbelief.</p><p>The Dawn Immortal&#x2019;s clone was also trembling, and the Resurrection Lily behind her was struggling. As for the false Immortal puppet controlled by the black-robed Patriarch, it was also trembling.</p><p>The instant the enormous figure appeared, the Patriarch Blood Demon that stood on Mount Blood Demon stepped out into the air and then flew up to sit cross-legged on top of the enormous head. Then, he slowly merged down into the enormous Demon.</p><p>It was at this point that the Demon&#x2019;s eyes suddenly opened.</p><p>&#x201C;This is my true self!</p><p>&#x201C;I was seriously injured, and chose this place to recuperate. I incarnated a clone with a drop of blood, and founded the Blood Demon Sect.&#x201D; His voice rumbled across the lands like thunder. Up above, the blood-colored sky glittered brightly. The more than 100,000 cultivators were trembling in shock, even the most powerful experts.</p><p>Meng Hao was equally shaken.</p><p>&#x201C;Unfortunately, I can only wield a fraction of the power that I could when I was at my peak. It would be difficult for me to harm a true Immortal. However, to kill a false Immortal&#x2026; is child&#x2019;s play.&#x201D; With that, his huge hand stretched out and grabbed the Dawn Immortal&#x2019;s clone.</p><p>Rumbling filled the air, and the Dawn Immortal&#x2019;s clone screamed miserably. The Resurrection Lily behind her writhed as she struggled to fight back. She could only hold on for a moment, though, before her body was crushed. She, along with the Resurrection Lily, began to fade away.</p><p>Before vanishing completely, the Dawn Immortal&#x2019;s cold, merciless voice rang out: &#x201C;Blood Demon, I refuse to believe that you will be able to keep ahold of that Demon body for much longer! Since you&#x2019;re dying, your Demon body will soon belong to me!&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Ah, so it&#x2019;s true&#x2026;. You came here for my Demon body.&#x201D; It was then that Blood Demon&#x2019;s eyes came to rest on the red-haired old man from the Golden Frost Sect. He stretched his finger out.</p><p>The old man trembled, but could do nothing to fight back. Blood Demon&#x2019;s finger touched him, and it was a boundless mountain smashing down onto him. He immediately was smashed into pieces, leaving behind only his Nascent Divinity. His expression was one of terror and despair, incapable as he was of fleeing.</p><p>Just when he thought he was going to disappear forever, Blood Demon calmly said, &#x201C;I&#x2019;ll leave you alive.&#x201D;</p><p>With that, a blood-red light descended from the blood-colored sky, enveloping the red-haired Patriarch, instantly transforming him into something that looked like a Blood Clone.</p><p>Along with the new body came a blank expression, as if all his previous memories had been wiped away.</p><p>&#x201C;From now on, you will be a Dharma Protector of the Blood Demon Sect,&#x201D; said Patriarch Blood Demon, his voice cool. Next, his gaze shifted to the 3rd Li Clan Patriarch, and his finger moved again.</p><p>The 3rd Li Clan Patriarch trembled, and his body exploded. As the blood and gore dissipated, his Nascent Divinity flew out, and was encased in a similar body of blood. His memories were erased, and he became another Dharma Protector of the Blood Demon Sect.</p><p>Patriarch Blood Demon seemed exhausted, and he closed his eyes, as if he didn&#x2019;t even have enough energy to keep them open. It seemed that his actions just now put quite a strain on him.</p><p>After a moment, he forced his eyes open again and looked at the puppet being controlled by the black-robed Patriarch. &#x201C;And then there&#x2019;s you&#x2026;. I think you, too, will be a Dharma Protector of the Blood Demon Sect.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;That one must die!&#x201D; said Meng Hao suddenly.</p><p>Blood Demon&#x2019;s eyes flickered. Without another word, he reached out and grabbed the false Immortal puppet and squeezed down violently. What was being crushed was in fact the Nascent Divinity of the black-robed old man.</p><p>A miserable scream could be heard as the Nascent Divinity was completely obliterated.</p><p>Having accomplished these things, the enormous Blood Demon closed his eyes. Apparently, he was now completely out of energy. He once again sat down cross-legged and then sank down into the ground. The image of Patriarch Blood Demon once again appeared at the top of his head, looking completely exhausted, and surrounded by an even stronger aura of death than before. As the enormous Demon disappeared into the earth, Patriarch Blood Demon stepped foot onto Mount Blood Demon. As he entered the Immortal&#x2019;s cave there, the sea of blood that covered the sky rushed back into the cave to reform the Blood Pond. Patriarch Blood Demon sluggishly sat down cross-legged to meditate.</p><p>It was at this point that Meng Hao suddenly heard Patriarch Blood Demon&#x2019;s exhausted voice in his ear.</p><p>&#x201C;I didn&#x2019;t want to use my real body, as it is an incredible drain on the scant bit of power I have left&#x2026;.</p><p>&#x201C;But you&#x2026; represent a hope that I cannot ignore&#x2026;.</p><p>&#x201C;I need to sleep now, and I won&#x2019;t be able to awaken again for another hundred years. Perhaps I will never awaken. As for the Blood Demon Sect&#x2026; I give it to you&#x2026;. Be careful of the Dawn Immortal. She is both a Resurrection Lily, and not a Resurrection Lily&#x2026;. Also, the great territorial war is coming soon.&#x201D;</p><p>The rift in the ground closed up, and the restrictive spell formation surrounding the area vanished. The more than 100,000 cultivators on the battlefield could now move again. Trembling, they looked with terror at Mount Blood Demon. It was hard to say who was first, but they began to retreat, scattering like a flock of birds, fighting amongst themselves to be the first to flee.</p><p>As for the 70,000 remaining Blood Demon Sect disciples, their killing intent was even more intense than ever. Their sect had narrowly escaped complete eradication in this war, and they would never rest easy unless they exacted their revenge.</p><p>&#x201C;Blood Prince!!&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Blood Prince!!&#x201D;</p><p>All of the Blood Demon disciples turned to look at Meng Hao as they awaited his decision about what to do next.</p><p>Meng Hao looked at the exhausted Blood Demon Sect disciples and then after a moment of contemplation said, &#x201C;Debts of blood can only be paid in full WITH blood! We rest for one month. After that, I will take you&#x2026; to unify the Southern Domain!&#x201D;</p><p>Their intense killing intent, along with the thirst to unify the Southern Domain, transformed their morale into one of excitement and frenzy. The mood completely enveloped the battered Blood Demon Sect!</p><p>Meanwhile, outside of the Blood Demon Sect, an old man sat cross-legged up in the sky. Beneath him was a pill furnace. He had a complex expression on his face as look down at the Blood Demon Sect.</p><p>It was Pill Demon, also known as Reverend Violet East of the Violet Fate Sect.</p><p>&#x201C;Patriarch Blood Demon, you have paid too heavy a price in order to prepare him to Sever the Devil and enter Dao Seeking. He is my apprentice, so this kindness is something that he should not have to pay for. I will take the responsibility to repay you.&#x201D; After a long, deep look at the Blood Demon Sect, he turned and vanished.</p><p>-----</p><p><em>This chapter was sponsored by Nico Zeese, Brett Flowers, Junior Fortytwo, and JQ</em></p>
