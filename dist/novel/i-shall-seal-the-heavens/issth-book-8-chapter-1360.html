<p><strong></strong></p><p>[/expand]</p><p>100,000 individuals were all thinking the same thing. Their life forces connected to the spell formation, and their souls thrummed with unyielding ardor. Their cultivation base power made them as one, as they fought together to protect Meng Hao.</p><p>Xuan Fang laughed coldly, then stomped his foot down. Instantly, everything began to shake violently, and an intense rumbling sound could be heard as the 100,000 cultivators coughed up mouthfuls of blood.</p><p>Meng Hao was in the middle of the spell formation, mind reeling. He couldn&apos;t simply sit there and ignore what was happening. He knew that he wasn&#x2019;t a match for a Paragon, and also knew that all he had to do was close his eyes and wait for enough time to pass. If enough time was bought it might be possible... to hold out for that full quarter hour until the mist dispersed.</p><p>At that time, he might be able to make it out alive!</p><p>However... Meng Hao did not choose to wait. Performing an incantation gesture, he ceased to draw upon the power of the sun. If he continued to do so in his current state, it would deplete the life forces of the 100,000 cultivators even faster than before, which was something he wouldn&#x2019;t do.</p><p>He strode forward, leaving the spell formation and heading toward Xuan Fang, who laughed loudly, eyes shining with scorn. He had actually been worried that Meng Hao would hole up, which would have been a waste of his time.</p><p>As soon as Meng Hao took action, Xuan Fang suddenly vanished, and then re-appeared right in front of him. Then, he raised his right hand, sending power slamming into Meng Hao that he couldn&#x2019;t possibly defend against. Meng Hao instantly staggered backward, blood spraying out of his mouth.</p><p>&#x201C;Crown Prince!!&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Crown Prince!!!&#x201D; The cries of the 100,000 cultivators rang out in anguish.</p><p>As Meng Hao hovered there, his Green Emperor&#x2019;s Eternal Incantation worked constantly to prevent his body from collapsing. However, under the pressure of a Paragon, he couldn&#x2019;t hold out for very long, and besides, his wounds had already reached a critical level.</p><p>Once again, Xuan Fang closed in, raising his right hand high, killing intent flickering in his eyes as he grabbed at Meng Hao&#x2019;s head.</p><p>&#x201C;Just die, would you!?&#x201D;</p><p>Even as Xuan Fang reached out to grab him, Meng Hao performed an incantation gesture with his right hand and then waved his finger.</p><p>Demon Sealing, Eighth Hex!</p><p>However, in the same moment that the Hexing magic was unleashed, and Xuan Fang stopped in place, the magic was shattered. The backlash slammed into Meng Hao, causing blood to spray out of his mouth. Even though it seemed as if he were staggering backward, suddenly, Time rippled in front of Meng Hao. Everything changed, causing a look of shock to appear on Xuan Fang&#x2019;s face. His eyes widened as Meng Hao suddenly vanished, then reappeared behind him.</p><p>Xuan Fang turned and lunged toward him, but ended up passing right through Meng Hao, as if he were nothing more than a shadow.</p><p>&#x201C;Time!&#x201D; Xuan Fang&#x2019;s eyes once again widened.</p><p>This was not some trivial change in time, but rather, contained the power of time travel. Apparently, Meng Hao had appeared several breaths of time before, right behind Xuan Fang!</p><p>This was none other than the strange time-walking technique that Meng Hao had learned from the black-robed Slaughter. When he reappeared, he was still directly behind Xuan Fang, and suddenly, his right hand transformed. Shockingly... the Battle Weapon appeared, which he raised high above his head as he took a step forward, seemingly walking from the past back into the present!</p><p>A shocking blade then slashed down!</p><p>Xuan Fang had no time to dodge. The blade slashed from the past into the present, making it impossible to evade. For the first time, a sensation of crisis filled Xuan Fang&#x2019;s mind. Although it wasn&#x2019;t a situation of deadly crisis, it was still something very rare for him to experience.</p><p>Rumbling could be heard echoing out in all directions as a bright flash of light descended onto Paragon Xuan Fang. Although he couldn&apos;t completely dodge, he managed to move slightly, ensuring that the blow didn&#x2019;t land on his forehead, but rather on his left shoulder!</p><p>A boom echoed out, and blood splashed as Paragon Xuan Fang&#x2019;s left arm was completely severed. Xuan Fang fell back at top speed, face ashen, eyes flickering with killing intent toward Meng Hao. In the next instant, his severed arm exploded, transforming into a sea of golden blood which then swept out toward Meng Hao.</p><p>Meng Hao trembled; he had already sustained serious injuries, and now he was coughing up more blood. His consciousness was starting to fade, and he was laughing bitterly. And yet, an unyielding gleam flared up in his eyes, and he sprang into motion, ignoring the damage he sustained in the process.</p><p>In the instant in which he burst into motion, Paragon Xuan Fang&#x2019;s right hand flashed with an incantation gesture, and stabbed out viciously with his finger, causing a long golden blade to appear. The blade slashed out with ferocious speed, and before Meng Hao could even react, the meat jelly flew out and blocked the blade.</p><p>A miserable shriek rang out as the meat jelly was sent flying back, clearly weakened. However, it didn&apos;t return to the bag of holding, but instead started to drag Meng Hao back into the spell formation.</p><p>&#x201C;You&#x2019;re not going anywhere!&#x201D; Paragon Xuan Fang said, his voice sinister and cold. All he had left was his right arm, which he stretched out toward Meng Hao. As he extended his fingers, Essence power erupted out.</p><p>Five Essences rumbled out, swirling together. Moments later, a sixth Essence appeared, and then a seventh. With the addition of the Essence of Time, the enormous hand that had been created was filled with completely unpredictable power. Once this hand was unleashed... it was certain to strike its target!</p><p>Meng Hao&apos;s face was deathly pale. In this critical moment, he shoved the meat jelly away, then suddenly reached his right hand out toward the incoming hand, toward Xuan Fang, then pointed his finger!</p><p>Demon Sealing, Eighth Hex!</p><p>Rumbling sounds could be heard as the huge hand ground to a halt. However, it only lasted for a moment before it lurched into motion again. As a result, blood sprayed out of Meng Hao&#x2019;s mouth because of the intense backlash. That was one of the reasons he had hesitated to use the Hexing magic before. If he tried to use it to tie up a Paragon, not only would he fail, he would also end up hurting himself.</p><p>When he had fought Eegoo, Choumen Tai had been in the process of enslaving him, which meant that the Hexing magic was possible to use. But now he was fighting a full Paragon, and it wasn&#x2019;t that his Hexing magic had a problem, but rather...</p><p>&#x201C;My cultivation base is too low!&#x201D; Meng Hao laughed bitterly and gritted his teeth. As the hand closed in on him, he unleashed his Essence of Divine Flame, then performed an incantation gesture with his right hand and waved his finger multiple times.</p><p>&#x201C;Demon Sealing, Seventh Hex!</p><p>&#x201C;Sixth Hex!</p><p>&#x201C;Fifth Hex!</p><p>&#x201C;Third Hex!</p><p>&#x201C;Second Hex!&#x201D;</p><p>If he was going to risk his life, then he might as well go all out. His eyes gleamed with madness as he unleashed all of his Hexing magic. Everything shook violently, and Xuan Fang frowned as the qi around him was thrown into chaos, and a profoundly disturbing sensation rose up.</p><p>Meng Hao was trembling, and his body was collapsing into a bloody mass because of the backlash from the Demon Sealing Hexing magic. What he really wanted to do was use the Seal the Heavens Incantation, but that relied on the power of the Mountains and Seas and, considering that he was now isolated and cut off, it had thus failed when he tried it.</p><p>Instead, he had to risk death to... combine his Demon Sealing Hexing magics into one attack!</p><p>Combining nine Hexes was the ultimate transformation a Demon Sealer could perform. But right now, Meng Hao only had mastery of six Hexes. He was missing the First Hex and the Fourth, and had yet to create his own Ninth Hex.</p><p>However, there was nothing else he could do at the moment. More than half of the quarter hour had passed, but that meant that half of that amount of time still remained. He simply couldn&#x2019;t hold on any longer. Meng Hao threw his head back and howled, pushing with all the power he had. His flesh and blood exploded, his bones shattered, all in his effort to fuse his Hexing magics together.</p><p>Massive rumbling sounds echoed out, and everyone on the sun was filled with shock. Xuan Fang gasped in astonishment at the sudden drastic transformations!</p><p>As of this moment, the entire Mountain and Sea Realm was trembling. The hosts of cultivators out in the starry sky were shocked, and the Outsiders were shaking. Even the Paragon from the 6th Heaven was astounded.</p><p>Sea Dream, and everyone else present, felt themselves trembling.</p><p>In sharp contrast was Shui Dongliu, who stood on Planet South Heaven, looking anxiously in Meng Hao&#x2019;s direction. His eyes were filled with concern, and even... turmoil!</p><p>Massive energy was rising up from the sun. Meng Hao shook violently as, all of a sudden, a sphere of light appeared in front of him. The light was in chaos, as six powers swirled around therein. It almost seemed as if that sphere of light were thinking, as if it wanted to give birth to some new entity.</p><p>The intense pressure caused Paragon Xuan Fang&#x2019;s face to flicker, and for the first time, he felt a sensation of deadly crisis. Without the slightest hesitation, he began to speed backward.</p><p>Even as he fell back, Meng Hao unleashed all the power he could muster, drawing upon even his life force, to push the turbid sphere of light forward. He was trembling, his flesh was being shredded to pieces, revealing his bones, which then shattered.</p><p>Rumbling could be heard as the sphere was pushed fully away from him. However, he was now completely drained of power. Even as he collapsed, the meat jelly scooped him up and carried him back inside the spell formation.</p><p>At the same time, the sphere of light shot toward Xuan Fang. As it closed in, Xuan Fang screamed. A sensation of deadly crisis overwhelmed him, and he suddenly began to grow in size. In the blink of an eye, he was 30,000 meters tall. Then, he instantly shrank back down, turning into a shocking golden lion.</p><p>His eyes flickered with the gleam of augury, as he drew upon his life force to unleash a magical technique that he hoped would help him identify the weakness in the magic he faced.</p><p><em>Death!</em></p><p><em>Death!</em></p><p><em>Death....</em></p><p>Xuan Fang&#x2019;s face was a mass of shock and terror. In a very short time, he performed more than ten thousand augury calculations, but no matter how he analyzed it, the end result was always the same. <em>Death!</em></p><p>&#x201C;This is impossible! Just what type of divine ability is this!?&#x201D; Xuan Fang was trembling as he fell back further. Unfortunately for him, the surrounding mist, which he had put in place to trap Meng Hao, now left him trapped!</p><p>&#x201C;Incomplete! It&#x2019;s an incomplete magic! That means I have a chance. He must have injured his soul to use it. Clearly this is a Dao in the midst of percolating, which he is drawing upon early!</p><p>&#x201C;Until he completes the Daoist magic later, it won&#x2019;t matter if he survives this day, he won&apos;t be able to use it again until then!!&#x201D; Xuan Fang&apos;s eyes flickered.</p><p>&#x201C;I still have a chance, and that is... in the shadows of Time!!&#x201D;</p><p>Roaring, his body flickered into motion as he unleashed his Dao of Time with all the power he could. His body turned blurry, and in the blink of an eye, his Undying Soul appeared.</p><p>&#x201C;I have lived for tens upon tens of thousands of years. Perhaps I have no hope of getting eight Essences, but even still, I have the ability to leave behind a soul at the end of every sixty-year-cycle. This is the ultimate magic of Time. Unless you destroy each and every one of those souls of mine, then you can never destroy my true soul!&#x201D; Xuan Fang&#x2019;s eyes were bright red. This was a magic he would only use if he had no other choice, if his life were truly in great danger!</p><p>This was a life-saving magic that he could use... only once in his life!</p><p>As of this moment, he was pushed to his very limit. If he didn&#x2019;t use the magic now, then he would die beyond the shadow of a doubt.</p><p><strong>Chapter 1360: Six Hexes Combine!</strong></p><p></p><hr><p></p>
