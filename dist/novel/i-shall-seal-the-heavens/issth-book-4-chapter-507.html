This black dragon was several thousand meters long; atop it stood over ten thousand Cultivators. Around the wrist of each one of these Cultivators was a black cord.</p><p>Killing intent pulsed out from within the black cords. The garments worn by the ten thousand Cultivators were simple, and hard looks could be seen on their faces. Their gazes were cold, and at first glance, looked very similar to the expressions of the Crow Divinity Tribe.</p><p>The main difference between the two was that, shockingly, on their foreheads could be seen the mark of a black dragon.</p><p>This was&#x2026; the great Black Dragon Tribe!</p><p>Before, they had a Spirit Severing Patriarch, and had shined gloriously for a thousand years. Unfortunately, their Spirit Severing Patriarch had perished. After that, they had relied on their own strength to plunder a Demon Spirit, and had then slaughtered their way out from within the Western Desert East region. Now they had finally arrived at South Cleaving Pass!</p><p>During their journey, their Tribe of close to one hundred thousand had been reduced to only about ten thousand. More than seventy percent of their Tribe had perished. Even still, this was the great Black Dragon Tribe. This was still that Tribe that was strong enough to strike fear into the hearts of Western Desert Cultivators.</p><p>Behind the Black Dragon was a rope that was festooned with&#x2026; skulls!</p><p>More than one hundred thousand skulls were threaded onto the black rope which was woven together to form something almost like a cape. It fluttered in the air as the black dragon flew, casting a shadow over the land beneath.</p><p>An aura of death surrounded it, and it was even possible to hear the sound of mourning souls that were sealed within the skulls, struggling to free themselves.</p><p>These were the skulls of enemies killed by the Black Dragon Clan in the battles on their journey. They were trophies of war, used to shock the surrounded thieves and robbers!</p><p>On the head of the black dragon were eight Cultivators. Most were old men with cold eyes, who made the Tribe as a whole seem like a sharp, unsheathed blade.</p><p>Among the eight men was a younger man who stuck out from the rest. He was extremely muscular and very tall, about a head taller than the average Western Desert Cultivator. He wore a simple black garment, and a fierce black dragon totem tattoo could be seen on his forehead. He looked rugged, and his eyes shone with a bright light.</p><p>Around his right wrist was wrapped a black cord. It seemed ordinary, and didn&#x2019;t appear to have any unusual characteristics, as if it were just a traditional ornamentation of the Black Dragon Tribe.</p><p>This person was none other than Xu Bai! <a id="footnoteref-1" href="#footnote-1">[1]</a></p><p>Years ago in the Realm of the Bridge Ruins, he and Chen Mo of the great Demon Talisman Tribe had attempted to snatch a Demon Spirit only to have it grabbed by Zhixiang. In the end, the three of them had watched wide-eyed as Meng Hao attacked, and then managed to grab the Demon Spirit for himself.</p><p>They gave chase, but Meng Hao was too fast. Then, Zhixiang interfered, forcing Xu Bai and Chen Mo to give up. It was with great regret that Xu Bai left the Realm of the Bridge Ruins. At the same time, he was left with a deep impression of Meng Hao and Zhixiang.</p><p>As the Black Dragon Tribe neared, it instantly attracted the attention of the tens of thousands of Cultivators who were watching the battle between the Crow Divinity Tribe and the Sea Demon Tribe. As soon as they looked over, they recognized the Black Dragon Tribe. Instantly, their faces began to flicker as they wondered what the Tribe would choose to do.</p><p>Xu Bai looked at the battle unfolding in South Cleaving Pass, and lightning seemed to dance in his eyes. He saw Meng Hao retreating from the bizarre statue, blood oozing out of his mouth.</p><p>Xu Bai saw Meng Hao, he saw the Sea Demon Tribe, he saw the strange, eight-armed statue, and he saw the three bandit Tribes whistling toward them from the other side of the pass.</p><p>He was quiet for the space of about three breaths, after which he lifted his head back and laughed.</p><p>&#x201C;Eccentric Bloodface, Meng Hao&#x2026;. I&#x2019;ve heard your name mentioned a lot recently. I&#x2019;ve been following the rumors with quite some interest&#x2026;. You led the Crow Divinity Tribe out from the Western Desert North region all the way to here. You&#x2026; have really caused me to admire you!&#x201D; His laughter was bright and crisp, without any feeling of insincerity. He truly did feel incredible admiration for Meng Hao. After all, stories about the Crow Divinity Tribe, Meng Hao and the events in the Realm of the Bridge Ruins, had long since spread far and wide.</p><p>In some ways, his feelings toward Meng Hao could be summed up in the expression, &#x201C;those who have the same illness sympathize with each other,&#x201D; or maybe even, &#x201C;people of talent appreciate one another.&#x201D; The Black Dragon Tribe and the Crow Divinity Tribe started out in much the same situation, although the Black Dragon Tribe was a bit better off. After the Apocalypse began, their Spirit Severing Patriarch perished and they lost their qualification to enter the Black Lands. The Tribe members abandoned themselves to hopelessness and despair. In addition to that, old enemies besieged and attacked them. However, the Patriarch had made certain preparations before death, and then Xu Bai rose to prominence, leading the Tribe on a path of slaughter that caused their faith to once again grow strong. At that point&#x2026; the great Black Dragon Tribe was firmly entrenched in the history books.</p><p>This was how they were similar to the Crow Divinity Tribe, and also the reason why Xu Bai next lifted his hand and pointed.</p><p>&#x201C;I, Xu Bai, detest those who interfere in the battles of others. Crow Divinity Tribe, allow my Black Dragon Tribe to obstruct the path of these three bandit Tribes!&#x201D; Instantly, the black dragon roared, and the ten thousand members of the great Black Dragon Tribe poured forth, transforming into black beams of light as they charged. They were accompanied by a sizable number of neo-demons. They shot into the battlefield, but didn&#x2019;t stop. They continued onward, directly toward the incoming three bandit Tribes.</p><p>The Greatfathers of the three other Tribes instantly shouted out.</p><p>&#x201C;Xu Bai, what are you doing?! There are no ill-feelings between us&#x2026;. We didn&#x2019;t attack you either! We&#x2019;re only helping South Cleaving Pass! Don&#x2019;t tell me that you&#x2019;re also trying to break through the pass like the Crow Divinity Tribe!?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Great Black Dragon Tribe, you need to think things through clearly! If you start fighting us, then it means you&#x2019;re declaring war on all the bandit Tribes! Once you leave the pass, you won&#x2019;t be able to move a single step!&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;I&#x2019;ve already thought things through clearly,&#x201D; replied Xu Bai, his voice cool. Rumbling killing intent spread out from the members of the Black Dragon Tribe. The faces of the members of the three bandit Tribes fell as intense fighting suddenly began!</p><p>Xu Bai laughed coldly. He truly had thought things through clearly. Even if the situation hadn&#x2019;t played out this way, he knew that after traveling through the pass, he would be surrounded by bandits. He also really did admire Meng Hao and the Crow Divinity Tribe. The fact that they dared to defy the South Cleaving Pass was something even he would not have been able to do.</p><p>In fact, before coming here, he had already grudgingly made the decision to hand over half of the Tribe&#x2019;s belongings.</p><p>But now, an opportunity existed that Xu Bai naturally could not pass up. He would never attack the Crow Divinity Tribe. That was because fundamentally speaking, in this Apocalypse, the Black Dragon Tribe and the Crow Divinity Tribe&#x2026; were the two most suitable Tribes to form an alliance!</p><p>Xu Bai had thought the matter through thoroughly. &#x201C;Divided, we fall. Forming an alliance is the best decision. If we can find the Heavenly Wind Tribe, and form a three-Tribe alliance, then we could fight directly back against those damned bandit Tribes outside of the Black Lands!&#x201D; He was certain that the Crow Divinity Tribe and the Heavenly Wind Tribe were also thinking the same thing.</p><p>The slaughter began. Booms filled the air. Meng Hao wiped the blood from his mouth as he ground to a halt. He didn&#x2019;t pay any attention to the great Black Dragon Tribe. That was because at the moment, he had to devote complete attention to this bizarre statue that he was up against.</p><p>His Devil Spear had stabbed into the statue&apos;s forehead, causing its head to crumble half apart. Furthermore, three of its arms had been shattered.</p><p>However, as the Devil Spear circled back around and then stabbed through the statue again, it didn&#x2019;t seem to inflict any damage. It was as if it had suddenly lost some of its effectiveness.</p><p>This caused Meng Hao&#x2019;s heart to tremble. The statue&#x2019;s remaining eye glittered coldly as it once again looked at him. Without hesitation, Meng Hao produced the blood-colored mask and put it on. Instantly, a bloody aura billowed up around him.</p><p>&#x201C;Ji Clan Blood Clone!&#x201D; Meng Hao&#x2019;s eyes flashed and a bright red glow of blood shined out from his forehead. At the same time, a long, blood-colored strand appeared which turned into a drop of blood. It wriggled as it suddenly expanded, transforming into a Blood Clone that looked exactly like Meng Hao. The statue&#x2019;s mouth was open as if it were about to speak again, when suddenly the Blood Clone shot toward it.</p><p>Instantly, the statue closed its mouth. It allowed the Blood Clone to pounce, and yet strangely, no injury was inflicted, not even the slightest. Meng Hao found this difficult to believe. The Blood Clone, having passed through the statue, was taken aback, as if it didn&#x2019;t understand.</p><p>It was at this point that the multi-armed statue&#x2019;s ghastly voice once again could be heard. &#x201C;Destruction!&#x201D;</p><p>A thunderous roar filled Meng Hao. Suddenly, his mind exploded with a burst of power that was a full three times stronger than his own five elements type power that he had used previously. It felt as if a sword were tearing through his brain, stabbing into his mind, ripping everything apart. Blood sprayed from his mouth and his face went pale. He suddenly felt incredibly weak.</p><p>This statue&#x2019;s divine ability was extremely bizarre, and Meng Hao was powerless to block it. He bit the tip of his tongue, using the pain to clear his head. His eyes were bloodshot as he, instead of retreating, turned into a beam of light that shot directly toward the statue.</p><p>&#x201C;The Blood Clone doesn&#x2019;t work&#x2026;.&#x201D; he thought as his speed increased. He transformed into a green smoke and a black moon. As he neared, he lifted his right hand up. Suddenly, Blood Immortal divine abilities manifested. Booms filled the air as he unleashed them all. However, just as was the case with the Devil Spear, none of them hurt the statue even the least bit.</p><p>This caused Meng Hao&#x2019;s face to fall. He waved his hand and the Lotus Time Formation appeared. It spun rapidly, rumbling as it unleashed the power of Time. It was not effective either.</p><p>&#x201C;Divine abilities are useless. Magical items are useless. The Devil Spear only worked once&#x2026;. Just what exactly is this statue made of!?!?&#x201D; Meng Hao&#x2019;s eyes flickered with killing intent as he endured the splitting pain in his head.</p><p>&#x201C;Why did the Devil Spear work once&#x2026;? When the Blood Clone neared, it was obviously about to speak, but then shut its mouth!&#x201D; Hundreds of ideas and possibilities flickered through Meng Hao&#x2019;s mind. Suddenly, his eyes narrowed.</p><p>&#x201C;Don&#x2019;t tell me&#x2026;.&#x201D; He gritted his teeth and then, without hesitation, shot toward the statue, mentally preparing himself.</p><p>The statue&#x2019;s expression was as cold as ever. The remaining eye on its half-destroyed head gleamed with mysterious coldness as it once again spoke, a third time: &#x201C;Incantation!&#x201D;</p><p>Psyche Destruction Incantation!</p><p>As soon as the third word began to leave its mouth, Meng Hao lifted his hand and employed the power of the Eighth Demon Sealing Hex. His finger pointed toward the Statue&#x2019;s open mouth. Even as the sound was coming out, and it suddenly stopped moving, Meng Hao slapped his bag of holding. Four wooden swords appeared, which instantly transformed into prismatic beams that shot toward the statue.</p><p>Simultaneously, in response to Meng Hao&#x2019;s advanced preparation just now, the Blood Clone pounced. Screaming sounds could be heard as the Devil Spear shot forward in attack. The Time Sword Formation rotated. The Blood Immortal divine abilities were unleashed. As soon as the word &#x201C;incantation&#x201D; left its mouth, booming could be heard!</p><p>A massive rumble shook everything as the entire statue began to tremble. The four wooden swords caused it to lose any power to resist. Boom! It began to collapse as the Devil Spear slammed into it. The Blood Clone absorbed its life force. The Time Sword Formation transformed it into ash. Meng Hao&#x2019;s Blood Immortal divine abilities then destroyed the ash!</p><p>At the same time, Meng Hao was coughing up blood. After the statue spoke the final word, a power three times more powerful than before exploded out inside of his body. Thankfully, it only lasted a brief instant. The statue was destroyed, making the pain last for only a short moment. Even still, blood oozed from Meng Hao&#x2019;s eyes, nose, ears and mouth. Even as he tumbled backward, he produced handfuls of medicinal pills, which he instantly consumed.</p><p>He looked up at the disappearing ash, and his eyes gleamed with coldness.</p><p>&#x201C;When its mouth was closed, it couldn&#x2019;t be hurt. When its mouth opened, it revealed its weakness!&#x201D;</p><p>-----</p><p>Xu Bai</p><p>[audio mp3=&quot;http://www.wuxiaworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/xu_bai.mp3&quot;][/audio]</p><p> </p><div class="footnotes"><ol><li><span id="footnote-1">Xu Bai&#x2019;s name in Chinese is X&#x1D4; b&#xE1;i.
