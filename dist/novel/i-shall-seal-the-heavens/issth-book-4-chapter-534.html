In front of Meng Hao&#x2019;s Seventh Anima, it was completely incapable of making a counterattack. As it retreated, its body suddenly broke up into countless pieces, transforming into thousands of bats.</p><p>The bats instantly scattered in all directions in retreat.</p><p>Meng Hao was currently consumed with the desire to kill. He gave a cold snort and then waved his right hand. The Devil Spear appeared in front of him. He slapped it, sending power from his Cultivation base exploding inside. The spear instantly exploded.</p><p>The resulting black mist expanded out, filled with innumerable vicious faces that shot toward the fleeing bats and began to consume them.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, countless miserable shrieks filled the air. After only a few breaths of time, there were only a few hundred bats left from the original group of thousands.</p><p>The remaining bats quickly reformed. A pop rang out as they transformed back into a physical form. This time, it did not look like the black-robed youth, but rather, the enormous Black Bat.</p><p>The Black Bat&#x2019;s eyes were filled with terror. The instant in which it appeared, it tried to flee, but Meng Hao shot forward, appeared directly in front of it. The Black Bat gave a cry of despair as Meng Hao lifted his hand up and pushed a finger down into its forehead. The power of extermination exploded out. It was like layered ripples of destruction that swept through the body of the Black Bat.</p><p>Booms rang out ceaselessly as the Black Bat screamed. Its body directly exploded into a haze of blood which spread out in all direction. Only the head remained, which Meng Hao grabbed and put into his bag of holding.</p><p>After the death occurred, the surroundings slowly grew quiet and peaceful.</p><p>Meanwhile, nearly a year&#x2019;s travel away in the Western Desert North region, far down at the bottom of the sea, a corpse sat cross-legged.</p><p>Half of its body was human, the other half, beastly. This was the creature from which Meng Hao had acquired the third wooden sword in the Crow Divinity Holy Land all those years ago. It was also the same creature that the black-robed youth had absorbed into his left eye and then suppressed.</p><p>Now, however, the corpse looked different than before; it had conspicuous bat wings sticking out from its back. It sat there motionless on the seafloor, lifeless, filled with an aura of death that was much like the Violet Sea around it.</p><p>Suddenly, the empty eyes of the corpse began to glow with light. The glow grew more and more obvious as an aura of life suddenly rose up within its body. Cracking sounds could be heard as it suddenly moved its neck.</p><p>Its rotten lips suddenly curved into a cold smile.</p><p>&#x201C;Petty Cultivator,&#x201D; said the corpse in a grating voice. &#x201C;He thinks he&#x2019;s clever and shrewd, but compared to a spirit like me, he&#x2019;s nothing. In the moment he was congratulating himself on his victory, I managed to slip out like a cicada shedding its skin.</p><p>&#x201C;He&#x2019;s definitely powerful, though. Thankfully, I was doubly prepared with an extremely realistic second body. Even the will of that body actually wasn&#x2019;t aware that my true self was doubly prepared. Too bad it really was killed.</p><p>&#x201C;However, that&#x2019;s also a good thing. Because he thinks that I&#x2019;ve perished, I can watch on secretly to see what conflicts develop between him and Patriarch Huyan.</p><p>&#x201C;When the crane and the clam fight, it&#x2019;s the fisherman who benefits. And I&#x2026; am the fisherman!&#x201D; The corpse&#x2019;s smile grew even colder and grimmer.</p><p>This corpse was the true Black Bat. Even as it sat there at the bottom of the sea, Meng Hao was back at the location in which he had killed the black-robed youth, frowning.</p><p>Everything had happened too smoothly, almost like water being poured down a gutter. It was like nothing had even happened at all. The profundity of Meng Hao&#x2019;s Cultivation base made everything incredibly simple.</p><p>However, Meng Hao still felt as if something weren&#x2019;t right.</p><p>Muttering to himself, his eyes flickered as he pulled out the Ji Clan fishing rod. The instant he touched the rod, a strange light flickered in his eyes. He watched as the bits of flesh and blood which were scattered around, the remains of the Black Bat, suddenly stopped moving.</p><p>On each piece of flesh or blood, Karma threads could be seen. Shockingly, almost all of the Karma threads were heading in the same direction.</p><p>Meng Hao&#x2019;s eyes flashed in concentration. His will began to follow the Karma threads through the air until they sank into the Violet Sea. They continued onward north, to the seafloor, where he finally saw the corpse with its grim smile.</p><p>As soon as his gaze fell upon the corpse, its face flickered and it looked up in disbelief.</p><p>At the same time, Meng Hao&#x2019;s will vanished from the Karma threads. He returned to his normal state and put the fishing rod away, his face extremely dark.</p><p>&#x201C;So, something WAS going on!&#x201D; he said, looking toward the Western Desert North region, killing intent flickering in his eyes.</p><p>Back in north, the Black Bat&#x2019;s eyes shone with a mysterious light, and its expression was one of fear, then suspicious. Finally, it grew even grimmer than before.</p><p>&#x201C;I musn&#x2019;t underestimate this guy. Just what method did he use to find me so easily? It gives me a very strange feeling.&#x201D; It rose to its feet thoughtfully, then shot up out from within the Violet Sea.</p><p>&#x201C;It doesn&#x2019;t matter. I can&#x2019;t stay here any more. I need to go hide in the Milky Way Sea. This Meng Hao&#x2026; is too bizarre!&#x201D; Its body flickered as it flew off into the distance.</p><p>A year&#x2019;s travel away, Meng Hao took a deep breath and then slowly sank back down into the Violet Sea. He sat down cross-legged on the seafloor, his eyes shining with an intense desire to kill.</p><p>&#x201C;I might be far away, but&#x2026; I still have ways to kill you!&#x201D; He closed his eyes. In that instant, he sent his will out to combine with the Violet Sea.</p><p>As of now, Meng Hao was being incarnated into the Violet Sea in a way much similar to what had occurred when he was in the midst of Demonic Transmigration. This time, he was fundamentally awake, so he would not lose himself.</p><p>Because of that, however, he would be incapable of wielding the complete power of the Violet Sea.</p><p>The instant in which Meng Hao&#x2019;s will fused with the Violet Sea, the entire sea instantly churned with enormous waves, and roaring filled the air. In the Western Desert North region, the corpse was speeding along. All of a sudden, streaks of blood appeared on its body. Down below, the Violet Sea roared and transformed into a whirlpool. The corpse&#x2019;s face instantly fell.</p><p>At the same time, a powerful roaring voice could be heard coming from within the whirlpool.</p><p>&#x201C;You want to frame Meng Hao and get away scot free? I don&#x2019;t think so.&#x201D; The voice became a roar like that of thunder, causing the corpse&#x2019;s face to fall even further. It took a deep breath. After pausing for a brief moment, it shot off as fast as possible.</p><p>As it fled, the water on the surface of the Violet Sea in the Western Desert North region began to congeal together. A gigantic hand suddenly began to stretch up out from the deep waters. The hand shot up toward the fleeing corpse.</p><p>The instant that the hand touched the corpse, the corpse opened its mouth to speak strange, complex words. The words transformed into a power that seemed to be of a different world, filled with ancient archaicness.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The explosive power of the words caused ripples to surround the corpse. Within the ripples could be seen reflections of an ancient world that had existed an indefinite amount of years in the past. The view was indistinct, but a roaring sound filled the air nonetheless.</p><p>The Violet Sea hand collapsed. However, the corpse&#x2019;s aura had clearly been weakened.</p><p>Without hesitation, it shot away at top speed. However, even as it did, eight more enormous hands suddenly began to rise up out of the sea, stretching out toward the fleeing corpse to reach toward it.</p><p>Booms rose up into the sky and echoed out across the sea waters. The corpse, its face filled with astonishment, spit out some life Qi. It performed a double-handed incantation, causing an undulating power to appear, some type of magical technique Meng Hao had never seen before.</p><p>It was formed of numerous bizarre magical symbols, each one of which seemed to pulse with a unique power that the Violet Sea was incapable of resisting.</p><p>Down in the Violet Sea, Meng Hao gave a cold snort. Even as the Black Bat corpse, grew weaker and weaker, an enormous face suddenly began to bulge out of the surface of the sea.</p><p>The face was none other than Meng Hao&#x2019;s!</p><p>Meng Hao might have been submerged on the bottom of the seafloor, but his will was engaged in fierce battle with the Black Bat corpse.</p><p>Meanwhile, back in the Black Lands, in a mountain valley filled with peach blossoms, was the enormous temple gate of the Heavenly Pursuit Tribe.</p><p>The valley was filled with birdsongs and the lovely fragrance of flowers. It was like a realm of Immortals. In one particular pavilion were two middle-aged men.</p><p>One was sitting in meditation, the other was standing. One wore a black robe, the other a white one.</p><p>However, their facial features were exactly alike.</p><p>The white-robed man sat cross-legged in meditation, unmoving. It seemed as if his will were eternally fused into the world. Unless some shocking event occurred that rocked the entire Heavenly Pursuit Tribe, he would remain there, unwaking.</p><p>He was completely immersed in secluded meditation, having spent years stabilizing himself after Severing his first Spirit and recovering the damage to his body.</p><p>Generally speaking, daily affairs were handled by his Divine Clone, who was of course the black-robed man who stood there across from him.</p><p>The black-robed man&#x2019;s face was extremely grim as he looked down at the shattered jade slip he held in his hand. His eyes radiated grief, and then&#x2026; a towering viciousness.</p><p>&#x201C;Someone dared to slay my only son&#x2026;. He was a bit arrogant, and often handled himself poorly. But&#x2026; he was my only son, the only son of Huyan Yunming! It doesn&#x2019;t matter what he did, no one is qualified to chide him, much less kill him!&#x201D;</p><p>The white-robed man who sat there in meditation was none other than Huyan Qing&#x2019;s father, the only Spirit Severing Cultivator of the Heavenly Pursuit Tribe, Patriarch Huyan.</p><p>The black-robed man, the Divine Clone, was also the translucent figure that Huyan Yunming had sent after Meng Hao that year to rob him of the Demon Spirit.</p><p>&#x201C;If someone cuts off the line of Huyan Yunming, then I will exterminate his entire Clan!&#x201D; The black-robed man flicked his sleeve and disappeared. When he reappeared, he was in mid-air above the Black Lands. His body flickered, and he was then outside of Blackgate Fort. Shockingly, he used greater teleportation again, and was now in mid-air above the Violet Sea</p><p>His Divine Sense shot out, sweeping about the area, looking for the location where Huyan Qing had been killed, as well as the person who killed him.</p><p>A few hours later, he found the location. As he floated there thoughtfully in mid-air, his face grew grimmer and grimmer. He waved his hand, causing Huyan Qing&#x2019;s life slip to transform into ash. As the bits of ash floated out to fill the area, they began to glow.</p><p>The softly glowing lights began to interlock, transforming into a screen. Visible on the screen was none other than the black-robed youth!</p><p>-----</p><p><em>This chapter was sponsored by TF</em></p><p></p>
