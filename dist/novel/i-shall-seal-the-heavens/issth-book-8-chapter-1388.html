<p><strong>Chapter 1388: We Mountain and Sea Cultivators!</strong></p><p>The large-headed cultivator and the female Paragon were now facing the wrath of Meng Hao; simultaneously, they unleashed Essence power that transformed into a sea of light that blocked his path.</p><p>Rumbling sounds rose up as Meng Hao shot forward and slammed head first into the sea of light, allowing it to envelop him as he fought his way forward.</p><p>The female Paragon was shocked, and the large-headed cultivator was visibly moved. They had just joined forces to unleash a shocking attack, but instead of evading, Meng Hao was trying to force his way through it.</p><p>Booms could be heard as an asteroid formed around Meng Hao, which shattered after only a few breaths of time. Then he became an azure roc, which shattered just as quickly. Finally, the meat jelly appeared, gritting its teeth as it transformed into a suit of armor. It was only at that point that Meng Hao burst out from within the sea of light!</p><p>&#x201C;Want to pass? Never!&#x201D; A venomous gleam appeared in the female Paragon&#x2019;s eyes, hatred for how Meng Hao had threatened her life during the recent fighting. She knew that he was powerful in terms of battle prowess, and that if he got past her, he would have a big influence on the fighting over Planet South Heaven. Therefore, she steeled herself in an attempt to block Meng Hao&#x2019;s path.</p><p>Neither Paragon Sea Dream, the Paragon puppet, nor Shui Dongliu were capable of forming clones, and thus were completely tied down fighting Dao Fang and the other 8-Essences Paragon. Ksitigarbha and the other Mountain and Sea Lords and powerful experts, as well as Wang Youcai and the other Chosen who had recently become Dao Sovereigns and Imperial Lords, were also caught up fighting their counterparts among the Outsiders.</p><p>Planet South Heaven was in critical danger!</p><p>The starry sky trembled as the Ninth Mountain teetered on the verge of collapse. This was absolutely the most critical moment of danger so far!</p><p>On Planet South Heaven itself, everything was shaking and rumbling. The seas and rivers ran red with blood. Emperor Tang&#x2019;s black-armored puppets were fighting fiercely, as were the ghosts of the Li Clan. Because of them, the power unleashed by the spell formation was even more shocking than before. At the moment, all Outsiders who attempted to break through the battle lines to enter Planet South Heaven were cut down.</p><p>Unfortunately, despite how the Outsiders were cut down, and despite the vast power of the spell formation itself, it was impossible for it to deal with the sheer numbers involved.</p><p>The Outsider army was too vast, and as they charged to their deaths in the spell formation, it began to grow dim.</p><p>Meng Hao&#x2019;s parents were completely spattered in blood. His sister was fighting with every ounce of strength she could muster, and Sun Hai stood by, protecting her. There were even a few times in which he sustained serious injuries to keep her safe.</p><p>Meng Hao saw all of this happening. He even saw his Master Pill Demon fighting ferociously, his alchemic flame burning bright. Although his cultivation base wasn&#x2019;t incredibly high, the medicinal pills he summoned allowed him to bolster the other Mountain and Sea cultivators with his own alchemic flame!</p><p>Fatty wept bitterly as he fought. Of his once flourishing group of beloved partners, more than half were dead. Fatty was enraged to the point of madness, eyes bloodshot as he took vicious bites out of the enemy forces.</p><p>Chen Fan was taciturn, and trembling. Although he was fighting and killing the Outsiders, his mind seemed to be in another place. It was as if some important and weighty matter had filled him with conflicting thoughts, as if he couldn&#x2019;t see through things clearly, and was struggling with a decision.</p><p>Then there was Ke Jiusi, who was able to lock down significant swaths of the Outsider army. In fact, because of Night&apos;s divine ability, some of the Outsiders&#x2019; most powerful experts were sucked away into ancient times to fight!</p><p>To see everyone he knew in such bitter situations caused Meng Hao to tremble. His eyes burned with flames as he burst out of the sea of light, ready to fight. The large-headed cultivator instantly appeared in front of him and punched out with all of the power of his flesh and blood.</p><p>A boom rang out, completely shaking Meng Hao. However, the counterstrike from Meng Hao was just as devastating. Both parties fell back, blood spraying out of their mouths.</p><p>At the same time, the female Paragon uttered a magical curse, causing the sea of light to twist and seethe, then explode out with power that inundated Meng Hao.</p><p>&#x201C;Want to get past here... I don&#x2019;t think so!&#x201D; The female Paragon chuckled coldly, backing up as she performed a double-handed incantation gesture, causing the sea of light to expand. Moments later, Meng Hao roars could be heard from within.</p><p>&#x201C;You... just don&#x2019;t know when to back down,&#x201D; the large-headed cultivator said slowly.</p><p>However, even as the words left his mouth, a new sound echoed out with the roaring in the sea of light. Suddenly, booming sounds like that of a huge drum could be heard!</p><p>Boom!</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>BOOM!!</p><p>It was almost as if a giant were walking about within that sea of light. After the sound echoed out seven times, the sound of the roaring reached a level that was difficult to put into words. Then, a colorful beam of light shot out from inside the sea of light.</p><p>It was none other than Meng Hao!</p><p>He was covered in blood, but as he shot out, the starry sky trembled, and an indescribably murderous aura exploded out, seeming to freeze everything. The large-headed cultivator gritted his teeth, sending his cultivation base into full rotation as he slammed toward Meng Hao.</p><p>Even as the boom of their collision rang out, the female Paragon suddenly bit the tip of her tongue and spat out some blood. Her hands flashed in a double-handed incantation gesture, and she suddenly seemed to age as she unleashed a strange Daoist magic that caused the glob of blood to transform into a sea, a second barrier after the sea of light!</p><p>After slamming into the large-headed cultivator, Meng Hao ignored any subsequent injuries to fly around the man, only to find a sea of blood now standing in his way.</p><p>A boom rang out, and the sea churned. The female Paragon let out a miserable cry, and her hair was thrown into disarray. She was shaking, and her skin was covered in rips and tears. However, the sea of blood held, and would not allow Meng Hao to pass!</p><p>&#x201C;You shall not pass!!&#x201D; the woman screamed. Meng Hao was stuck inside of the sea of blood, his face pale, his body trembling. It was at that point that, without the slightest hesitation, he produced the Sun Bow and drew upon his life force to unleash two arrows!</p><p>The first arrow pierced through the sea of blood, destroying more than half of it. The second arrow shot toward the female Paragon herself, causing her eyes to widen as she fell back. This in turn caused the large-headed cultivator, who had initially been focused on blocking Meng Hao&#x2019;s progress, to change his plan and move to save the female Paragon.</p><p>All of this happened in the time it takes a spark to fly off of a piece of flint. After shooting the two arrows, Meng Hao&#x2019;s body was significantly withered, but his eyes gleamed with determination. Ignoring everything else, he unleashed the top speed he could muster to shoot toward Planet South Heaven!</p><p>Unfortunately, he was a bit too late!</p><p>Outside of Planet South Heaven, Fang Wei was laughing. His eyes gleamed with ferocity, madness, and slaughter. He had lost his right arm, his left arm, and both his legs. However, he still had his torso!</p><p>&#x201C;I am Fang Wei. The Wei in my name means to defend. Defend the Fang Clan!!&#x201D;</p><p>As he fought on madly, other members of the Fang Clan chose to self-detonate, sending explosive power out to bury the Outsiders!</p><p>The Grand Elder fell in battle!</p><p>Fang Yanxu was there, hair in disarray, drenched in blood. Letting out a piercing cry, he self-detonated!</p><p>One Chosen after another fell in battle. There were many faces familiar to Meng Hao, and some which were strangers. However, as their voices rang out in the moments before their deaths, they became like swords that stabbed Meng Hao in the heart!</p><p>His parents were injured, Fang Yu was injured, Xu Qing was injured. Wounds crisscrossed Chen Fan and Sun Hai. Booms filled Planet South Heaven as the last of the black-armored puppets was destroyed!</p><p>Emperor Tang laughed bitterly as countless Outsiders blasted away at the Li Clan spell formation. Clearly, it was on the verge of complete collapse.</p><p>&#x201C;The Li Clan is one of the Allheaven Clans,&#x201D; he said. &#x201C;Back then... we sacrificed our lives to create this spell formation. Today... we will make another sacrifice. Why wouldn&#x2019;t we die for the Mountain and Sea Realm!?</p><p>&#x201C;We Mountain and Sea cultivators live and die for the Mountains and Seas!&#x201D; Emperor Tang&#x2019;s laughter grew louder and louder as he charged into the fighting, joined by the countless Li Clan ghosts from the spell formation.</p><p>One living cultivator led the ghosts of his clan into a deadly offensive, slaughtering their way into the army of Outsiders, killing one after another after another!!</p><p>In the end, Emperor Tang&#x2019;s laughter rang out as he decisively shouted out in a voice that echoed through all Heaven and Earth!</p><p>&#x201C;We Mountain and Sea cultivators live and die for the Mountains and Seas!&#x201D;</p><p>BOOOOMMMMMM!</p><p>When he chose to self-detonate, the last living member of the Li Clan exploded, after which all of the ghosts... also began to explode. In truth, the ghosts themselves could not self-detonate. What was exploding... was Planet South Heaven&apos;s spell formation!</p><p>The Li Clan ghosts, the structure of the entire South Heaven Death Formation, were all exploding!</p><p>The spell formation shook all of the lands, sending out a shockwave that blasted away all wind and clouds!</p><p>The spell formation itself became resplendent light, and a screaming tempest that raged out in all directions. The Outsiders in the army were astonished, and those looks of shock were the last expressions to appear on their faces for all eternity!</p><p>The blast rattled out, transforming one Outsider after another into nothing more than ash. The huge boom caused all fighters in the war to turn their heads to look.</p><p>Outsiders and Mountain and Sea cultivators alike couldn&#x2019;t help but look over.</p><p>What they saw was the shockwave of the spell formation spreading out in a ring, wiping out more than forty percent of the Outsider army around Planet South Heaven!</p><p>The Li Clan was an Allheaven Clan, a remnant of the true forces who had fought in the original war of the Paragon Immortal Realm. They swore to defend the Mountain and Sea Realm, and on this day, they lived up to their oath of tens upon tens of thousands of years!</p><p>Each and every member of the clan died. Not a single successor to the bloodline remained!</p><p>A wave of grief swept up into the hearts and minds of all of the cultivators of the Mountain and Sea Realm.</p><p>&#x201C;We Mountain and Sea cultivators live and die for the Mountains and Seas!&#x201D; Those words echoed out into their minds, affixing themselves there for all time.</p><p></p><hr><p></p>
