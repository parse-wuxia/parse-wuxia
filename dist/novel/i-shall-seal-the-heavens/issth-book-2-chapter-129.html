<p><strong>Chapter 129: Li Clan Patriarch!</strong></p><p>It was impossible to see clearly just how many of the green tentacles shot forth. They were fast, and within the blink of an eye were nearly one hundred meters away from Meng Hao. It seemed as if they would cross the space in an instant. But just then, the mastiff let out a roar and flew up.</p><p>Its fifteen-meter-long frame flickered as it shot to defend Meng Hao. A booming sound began to ring out, louder than the thunder, shaking the entire world. A blood-colored glow emanated out from the mastiff, slamming into the incoming tentacles. A shaking boom filled the air, which lasted for the space of about ten breaths. Then, one by one, the tentacles disintegrated into a green mist, which spread all about.</p><p>The mastiff appeared tired, but it looked down and let out a roar nonetheless. It moved to the side, and Meng Hao emerged unscathed. He pet the mastiff&#x2019;s head, then continued on toward the ancient temple.</p><p>They shot forward at high speed, man and dog together.</p><p>When they were about six hundred meters from the temple, the green mist created by the disintegration of the tentacles suddenly started moving. It began to coagulate, and then, in the blink of an eye, transformed into a gigantic mist sphere, directly in Meng Hao&#x2019;s path.</p><p>The mist roiled, emitting a rumbling sound as it gradually formed into the shape of a head. It was green colored and illusory, with glowing eyes. It opened its mouth, and more mist poured out. This mist was filled with mist horses, which flew in a beeline toward Meng Hao and the mastiff.</p><p>As they approached, Meng Hao&#x2019;s eyes narrowed. He lifted his right hand and waved it in a gesture that only he could recognize as some type of sealing incantation. Then, he pushed his hand down onto the mastiff.</p><p>When the seal mark dropped onto the mastiff, a crimson glow began to emanate out. It contained an icy coldness that froze everything it touched! The flying mist horses were instantly sealed up!</p><p>The arms below, the faces, the sludge, everything was frozen.</p><p>If he didn&#x2019;t acquire the Legacy, then Meng Hao shouldn&apos;t be able to use this technique outside of this world, because he wouldn&#x2019;t have the Blood Divinity with him. But having received the Legacy of the Eighth Demon Sealing Hex, he was familiar with sealing techniques. This new technique was relatively powerful, and Meng Hao had the feeling that with sufficient research, he could probably use it even without the Blood Divinity, were he at the proper level.</p><p>As the crimson glow swept out, sealing everything, Meng Hao continued to shoot forward. Avoiding the gigantic head, he and the mastiff sped on toward the ancient temple.</p><p>Just as it seemed they would be able to approach it successfully, an imminent sense of life-and-death danger rose up from within Meng Hao. Suddenly, the mastiff, its body trembling, grabbed his clothes in its mouth and pulled him back.</p><p>A boom resounded out as a massive sword blade nearly three meters thick, swung down right in front of Meng Hao. It stabbed into the ground, sending out massive tremors. A massive fissure spread out; at the same time, the ice seal began to split up. In an instant, everything had returned to its normal state.</p><p>The massive sword, which moments ago had been floating in mid-air, was being held by the statue which stood outside the temple.</p><p>Its descending attack had caused Meng Hao to cough up a mouthful of blood. His face was pale as the mastiff dragged him back. As they retreated, the gigantic statue suddenly seemed to come to life. It slowly lowered its head, and its gaze fell upon Meng Hao. A difficult to describe pressure suddenly enveloped him, filling him with icy cold. It was as if the thing&#x2019;s gaze could see the deepest secrets within him.</p><p>As this happened, the arms in the ooze no longer stretched out. Instead, they slowly sucked back into the sludge, as if the statue filled them with dread. The green mist head floating in the air lowered its gaze, seemingly paying respects to the statue.</p><p>The thunder and lightning in the sky, however, grew more intense. They focused on the statue, crashing onto its surface, as if the Heavens wanted the statue to crumble.</p><p>Next to Meng Hao, the mastiff trembled and stretched out prone, as if the statue&#x2019;s existence was a force that could not be resisted.</p><p>&#x201C;Tribulation Lightning has fallen for countless years. Even though it is THIS matrix, even though I am not HIM, you still try to destroy my spirit&#x2026;? Screw off!&#x201D;</p><p>The statue lifted its right hand and snapped its fingers together. An enormous boom filled the air, and the statue&#x2019;s hand seemed to become like a black hole. The lightning quivered, then began to condense together and then collapse into countless arcs of electricity which then disappeared.</p><p>In an instant&#x2026; the sky became completely devoid of lightning. Everything was quiet. The ground quivered, and the countless figures within the sludge trembled. The floating mist head bowed even lower, shaking.</p><p>The mastiff behaved the same. It seemed that the will of this statue was something it was incapable of resisting.</p><p>&#x201C;Your Dao Pillar does not conform with the requirements for the Legacy,&#x201D; said the statue, looking coldly at Meng Hao. &#x201C;You&#x2026; do not qualify to acquire the Legacy. Considering you made it through the fifth matrix, I won&#x2019;t destroy you. Screw off!&#x201D; Everything shook as its voice sounded out. Blood spurted from Meng Hao&#x2019;s mouth, and his body was thrown backward hundreds and hundreds of meters. An enormous glowing door appeared near him.</p><p>&#x201C;And you&#x2026;.&#x201D; said the statue coolly, its cold gaze lowering onto the trembling mastiff. &#x201C;Second-rate spawn of Blood. You don&#x2019;t even deserve to be consumed by me, let alone become the Weapon Spirit&#x2026;.&#x201D; Its left hand slowly lifted up the sword, preparing to slash down onto the quivering mastiff.</p><p>Meng Hao&#x2019;s eyes were bloodshot. Behind him was the glowing door. All he had to do was step through, and he could leave the sixth matrix. But what had just happened caused him to stop in his tracks. The effort caused a snapping sound to emanate from his right leg, and he coughed up a mouthful of blood.</p><p>&#x201C;Senior, if I&#x2019;m not qualified to acquire the Legacy, very well. But please, don&#x2019;t hurt it&#x2026;.&#x201D; As Meng Hao&#x2019;s voice rang out, the mastiff trembled. It wanted to look back at Meng Hao, but the pressure exuded by the statue seemed to have activated some ancient branding within it. It could only tremble, powerless to resist. A weak whine sounded out from its mouth.</p><p>The statue&#x2019;s giant sword paused. It looked at Meng Hao. &#x201C;You&#x2019;ve lost your qualifications to leave this place,&#x201D; it said coolly. The glowing door instantly began to fall to pieces.</p><p>The sword swept through the air, not toward the mastiff, but toward Meng Hao. A boom resounded out, and blood exploded from Meng Hao&#x2019;s body. He lost control of himself, tumbling down toward the sludge.</p><p>As he fell, grasping hands reached toward him, clasping onto him, preparing to drag him down inside.</p><p>It was at this moment that Meng Hao&#x2019;s Cultivation base was suddenly restricted; he couldn&#x2019;t circulate it at all. He could only watch as he was slowly pulled down into the ooze.</p><p>His eyes were red, filled with resistance and ferocity.</p><p>The mastiff, which was also being suppressed, suddenly let out a shrill howl. Trembling, it lifted its head. Its mountain-like body suddenly exploded with an unprecedented power. Cracking sounds could be heard from inside it. It suddenly seemed as if it would burst into flame, a flame of blood. Suddenly, its body began to expand; it was now thirty meters long. It burst free from the control of the statue and smashed through the ancient seal within itself. It flew up with a roar, charging toward Meng Hao, who was already half sunk into the ooze.</p><p>&#x201C;So, the burning of the Blood spirit&#x2026;.&#x201D; said the statue coldly. &#x201C;Blood Divinities are bloodthirsty, and have no feelings. You second-rate spawn of Blood. You do not deserve to have spiritual consciousness.&#x201D; It raised its left hand, and then the sword began to slash down again, to exterminate both Meng Hao and the mastiff in one fell swoop.</p><p>But then suddenly, before the sword could fall, a look of struggle appeared in the eyes of the statue. The sword paused in mid-air.</p><p>&#x201C;The will of the Blood slave&#x2026;.&#x201D; said the statue, its voice grim. &#x201C;Damn you, won&#x2019;t you just go away? I&#x2019;m trying to help your master&#x2019;s Legacy. I want his Legacy to live on, to be acquired by another. Why&#x2026; why are you resisting me!? There are no rules in this Legacy tournament, so for me to possess you is simply the will of heaven!&#x201D; The struggle in its eyes gradually began to fade.</p><p>Meanwhile, the mastiff&#x2019;s body was engulfed in a bloody flame. It slammed into the ooze, roaring as the bloody glow of flames emanated in all directions. It instantly turned countless arms into ash. The sludge caved in on itself, revealing a pale-faced Meng Hao. The mastiff grabbed him in its mouth, then flew up into the air, shooting toward the large door in the ancient temple.</p><p>It flew with incredible speed, seemingly ready to sacrifice everything to get Meng Hao to the door.</p><p>Meng Hao&#x2019;s eyes snapped open, and he looked at the mastiff. Then he glanced behind, and saw the statue. The struggle was now almost completely gone from its eyes. It stabbed its giant sword into the sludge, and suddenly, the countless arms emanated a demonic glow. They shot up, a myriad of grasping hands, flying toward Meng Hao.</p><p>The mastiff glanced down at Meng Hao, and a wistful expression appeared in its eyes. As the myriad of hands closed in, its body erupted into flames. It tossed its head, throwing Meng Hao toward the stone door. It had no time to lick his hand as it had when it was small.</p><p>The bloody glow around its body was already fading, and weakness flashed in its eyes. A death aura began to emanate out of it as the countless hands surrounded it. The tens upon tens of thousands of encircling hands wrenched it down into the ooze.</p><p>Its eyes were wistful as it seemed to recall the past. It seemed to be thinking of how it had stretched out on its master&#x2019;s palm, and how wonderful it felt to be pet on the head. It remembered all of these things, and thought of its master&#x2026;.</p><p>Meng Hao watched all of this dumbfounded. His body slammed into the half-opened door, and the world around him began to fall apart. Everything inside, including the mastiff, disappeared. And yet, what he had just witnessed could never be forgotten.</p><p>The mastiff&#x2019;s final glance into his eyes caused him to weep tears of blood, and kindled in him a blazing fury.</p><p>Back in the sixth matrix, the struggle within the statue&#x2019;s eyes was completely gone. Its right hand lowered and opened up.</p><p>There, standing on the palm of its hand, was a man. He wore a white robe, and was extremely handsome. Swirling in the air next to him was a thirty-meter long Blood Dragon. This was none other than&#x2026; the Chosen of the Li Clan, Li Daoyi!</p><p>He stood on the statue&#x2019;s palm, an expression of utmost respect on his face. He knelt down on one knee and offered a deep salute.</p><p>&#x201C;Junior pays respects to the Patriarch.&#x201D;</p><p>-----</p><p><em>This chapter was sponsored by Mai Le, Kok Yan Leung, Joshua Jacobs and Anyonymous</em></p>
