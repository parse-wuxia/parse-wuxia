In the blink of an eye, the astonishing flag&#x2026; shot toward the black-robed man.</p><p>His face instantly filled with disbelief as he was sent tumbling backward. He was fast, but not fast enough to avoid the flag of three streamers. Booms filled the air as the flag wrapped around his body and began to strangle him to death!</p><p>Popping sounds filled the air as the black spear the man held was shattered into pieces. However, after that happened, the man suddenly coalesced out of the air again off in the distance. This time, he was even more illusory and flickered even more. He was clearly much weaker.</p><p>&#x201C;That flag&#x2026; that flag&#x2026;.&#x201D; His eyes were wide as he stared at the flag circulating around Meng Hao.</p><p>The man&#x2019;s body had been exploded by the flag, and weakened greatly. Meng Hao strode forward and once again recited the scripture which he had used against Patriarch Reliance, that tool of the Demon Sealers to make death tremble, the Demon Sealing Scripture:</p><p>&#x201C;Ancient Dao; Tenacious Desire to Seal the Heavens; Benefaction for All in the Mountains; Dao Tribulation Must Come to the Nine Mountains and Seas; My Fate is the Aeon!&#x201D;</p><p>The instant the scripture was uttered, the black-robed man once more retreated backward and let out a miserable howl.</p><p>&#x201C;Dammit! Dammit! You&#x2019;re too despicable!!&#x201D; he roared. At this point, how could he not understand that Meng Hao&#x2019;s purpose in using the flag was to distract him from suppressing the scripture? It had been a very, very long time since he had felt frustration such as this. He had originally stood in a position of ultimate superiority, but in the blink of an eye had been severely weakened. His body had been shattered, and before he could even reform himself, he had been suppressed with the scripture as this damned, despicable bastard once again recited the Demon Sealing Scripture.</p><p>Almost at the exact same time as the black-robed man began to retreat, Meng Hao&#x2019;s eyes suddenly flickered. <em>Take advantage of weakness; take the opponent&#x2019;s life!</em> That was Meng Hao&#x2019;s doctrine of fighting. Without hesitation, his right hand waved through the air, causing a band of blood-colored light to shoot toward the black-robed man with incredible speed.</p><p>Shockingly, within this bloody beam of light was a Blood Clone!</p><p>Ji Clan Blood Clone!</p><p>As soon as it appeared, everything in the area was stained with a crimson glow. The black-robed man was suppressed by the scripture; his body trembled as the Blood Clone pounced onto him.</p><p>His face completely fell; there was a bang, and his body exploded into pieces. Massive amounts of black mist that made up his devilish will and life force, were absorbed by the Blood Clone.</p><p>&#x201C;I won&#x2019;t accept this!!&#x201D; Off in the distance, the black-robed man once again appeared, this time, even weaker than before. He raised his head up and howled. He really couldn&#x2019;t accept the situation. In his former peak of power, he could easily fight back against even this Blood Clone. But now, he had been weakened even further.</p><p>Instantly, a feeling of imminent death flared up in his mind. He could never have possibly imagined that a day would come in which he would actually be slain.</p><p>As the Blood Clone closed in on him again, madness filled his eyes. He suddenly raised his hand and pointed toward the vortex up in the sky.</p><p>&#x201C;Lonelytomb!&#x201D; he howled.</p><p>As the words echoed out, his body flashed. At the same time, the mist on the altar up in the vortex began to roil. It seemed to be struggling with the faces that existed on its surface. However, the faces suppressed it with the same insanity as before.</p><p>As they suppressed the mist, massive amounts of life force and Demonic Qi began to emanate out from the tens of thousands of people that had been surrounded by the mist of the Eight Branch Alliance. All of these Cultivators who had come to participate in the auction began to tremble. Their bodies withered and they aged rapidly. Their life force oozed out from their orifices to merge with Demonic Qi, which then shot toward the whirlpool.</p><p>The life force of tens of thousands of people transformed into countless bands of Qi which shot into the whirlpool. After it was madly consumed by the faces; suddenly, nearly half of the faces suddenly shot out from within the mist. They&#x2026; charged out from within the vortex, shooting through the sky toward the black-robed man.</p><p>As they left the vortex, the mist on the altar began to emit intense howls. It was as if there was something inside struggling madly to break out from being sealed.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, the faces reached the black-robed man and began to circulate around him. They were filled with cruelty, madness and a thirst for blood as they fused into the black-robed man. As they did, his aura rose up, increasing with shocking intensity.</p><p>A billowing black aura roiled, filled with massive amounts of vicious faces. Each one of these faces was a totem toward which the Eight Branch Alliance Cultivators exercised faith.</p><p>&#x201C;I am Lonelytomb, I am a Devil Construct&#x2026;. I am Demon Weapon Lonelytomb, formed from the grievances of the lives I have exterminated throughout the countless years, a Devil Construct!</p><p>&#x201C;Lonelytomb destroys, the Devil Construct rises!&#x201D; A strange light shone in the eyes of the black-robed man. His aura suddenly exploded out, and black Qi filled the area. The Ji Clan Blood Clone suddenly stopped in its tracks, staring at the black-robed man. It seemed to have sensed something threatening.</p><p>Meng Hao took a deep breath, and a look of unprecedented concentration appeared on his face.</p><p>It was at this moment that suddenly, beam after beam of colourful light appeared off in the distance. Suddenly, tens of thousands of Cultivators suddenly appeared.</p><p>These were the Cultivators from the local Tribes that were after the Crow Divinity Tribe to rob its Demon Spirit. After they appeared, their killing intent soared to new heights. However, when they saw the condition of the battlefield, they couldn&#x2019;t help but gasp and suddenly grow silent.</p><p>Their eyes were instantly fixed on Meng Hao and the black robed man who was billowing with a massive black aura.</p><p>&#x201C;DIE!&#x201D; cried the black-robed man, taking a step forward. He lifted his right hand, causing the black Qi to seethe and then transform into an enormous, ferocious face which shot toward Meng Hao.</p><p>At the same time, more black Qi swirled out and shot toward the Blood Clone.</p><p>Meng Hao slipped the blood-colored mask back on. A glint of determination could be seen as he took a deep breath, flashed an incantation gesture with this right hand, and then pointed out.</p><p>&#x201C;Without a face!&#x201D;</p><p>An equally large face suddenly appeared, which was none other than the Blood Immortal divine ability. It was Meng Hao&#x2019;s own face which shot through the air toward the face of black Qi, which was formed from countless smaller vicious faces.</p><p>Shocking rumbling filled the air as Meng Hao spoke again.</p><p>&#x201C;A single word!&#x201D; Instantly, the lips of the face he had summoned began to move. Sound waves rippled out.</p><p>&#x201C;Flames of war unify!&#x201D; He lifted both hands up and then pushed them toward the ground. Immediately smoke rose up in all directions, along with something that looked like the flames of war. This was the third form of the Blood Immortal legacy.</p><p>Amidst the booming sounds, Meng Hao&#x2019;s eyes shone with a brilliant light.</p><p>&#x201C;I need&#x2026; your faith power!&#x201D; he cried out. One by one, the members of the Crow Divinity Tribe began to kowtow. The totem tattoos on their body, which were part of Meng Hao, began to glow with light.</p><p>&#x201C;Sundered clouds&#x2026;.&#x201D; Boundless faith power poured into Meng Hao from all directions. It exploded in intensity, allowing Meng Hao to utilize something he had never used before, the fourth form of the Blood Immortal legacy!</p><p>The sundered clouds from &#x201C;sundered clouds, a bloody rain, seas that cover the sky!&#x201D;</p><p>Sundered clouds! Clouds that were once whole but then sundered. The power of these sundered clouds would give rise to a wind of sundered clouds that could crush Heaven and Earth. This power clearly vastly exceeded that of the first three forms of the Blood Immortal legacy. The shocking intensity of the power caused countless layers of clouds to suddenly spring out around Meng Hao. They spread out, causing a thick fog to fill the entire area.</p><p>This fog, was actually made of clouds.</p><p>The power of sundered clouds came from&#x2026; the breaking of clouds!</p><p>Rumbling echoed out as the cloud fog in the area suddenly looked as if it were being ripped apart by giant, invisible hands. They shattered, and in that instant of shattering, the face that had been magically summoned by the black-robed man&#x2019;s divine ability, suddenly fell to pieces.</p><p>The black-robed man staggered back, still unable to accept the situation. He was now only able to wield thirty percent of the power of his Cultivation base. The rest had been constantly weakened during the course of the battle.</p><p>When he saw his magic once again being shattered, he lifted his head up and howled. Both hands performed an incantation gesture, and once again, roughly half of the faces on the mist in the vortex flew out and fused into his body. Yet again, his aura exploded out.</p><p>His face suddenly grew incredibly vicious, and he pointed down toward the tens of thousands of auction participants down on the ground.</p><p>Desolate shrieks resulted as all of the Cultivators, with the exception of Sun Dahai who was protected by Meng Hao&#x2019;s shield, had their life forces completely sucked out of their bodies and fused into the Demonic Qi. The Demonic Qi, and even the mist that surrounded the Cultivators, all shot toward the black-robed man.</p><p>As the mist was sucked away, it revealed tens of thousands of desiccated corpses lying about everywhere!</p><p>The black-robed man howled as the mists fused into his body, causing his Cultivation base to begin to recover. He lifted his hand and made a snatching gesture toward Meng Hao.</p><p>In response to this snatching gesture, black mist exploded out from his body to transform into an enormous hand three thousand meters wide that shot toward Meng Hao.</p><p>&#x201C;A bloody rain!&#x201D; said Meng Hao, performing a double-handed incantation gesture. At this critical moment, he employed the fifth form of the Blood Immortal divine ability. Under Meng Hao&#x2019;s control, the Blood Clone exploded, transforming into countless beams of bloody light that shot toward Meng Hao. They fused with the bloody rain that Meng Hao had just summoned, causing the entire area to actually&#x2026; rain with blood.</p><p>Every single drop in this monstrous rain of blood was filled with the power of the Blood Immortal divine ability. It all shot through the air toward the mist hand summoned by the black-robed man.</p><p>The sight of it caused everyone in the area to be shocked to the core. A boom rang out that could be heard for tens of thousand of kilometers in every direction. Blood sprayed out of Meng Hao&#x2019;s mouth as he was sent tumbling backward. His divine ability collapsed. The bloody rain flew out in all directions. The Blood Clone was now listless. The black-robed man&#x2019;s body trembled as he was yet again weakened to the point that it seemed it might disappear at any moment. Because he had been weakened by the scripture, this battle was turning out to be quite challenging. However, victory was in sight. His face twisted savagely, he went all out, causing another black mist hand to shoot toward Meng Hao.</p><p>&#x201C;Die, Demon Sealer!!&#x201D;</p><p>It was at this exact moment that&#x2026;.</p><p>&#x201C;Devil Construct, dost thou dare!?!?&#x201D; An enraged voice echoed out like thunder, seemingly containing the might of the Heavens. It came from within the world of the vortex, like a raging torrent emerging from within the black mist on the altar.</p><p>As the voice exploded out, the remaining faces that were trying to suppress the black mist suddenly emitted miserable shrieks. They instantly collapsed into pieces, causing the mist to suddenly spread out in all directions to reveal&#x2026; a pale white spear that was stabbed into the middle of the altar.</p><p>This spear was&#x2026; the true Demon Weapon Lonelytomb!!</p><p>-----</p><p><em>This chapter was sponsored by ExtremeGTP, Austin Coon, Anescha Tiesbohnenkamp, Yu-Chiang Hsu, and Maxpro</em></p><p></p>
