Because of this, the Eyeless Larva could never be killed, nor could its silk be destroyed. It was truly miraculous.</p><p>&#x201C;This creature is a defiance of the Heavens&#x2026;.&#x201D; After feeling the connection with the Eyeless Larva, Meng Hao&#x2019;s eyes began to shine, and his heart pounded.</p><p>Lord Fifth looked crestfallen and filled with envy as it looked at Meng Hao, as if its heart was on the verge of exploding. It was something extraordinary and special, and was also able to sense what had just happened. Its gaze fell onto the Eyeless Larva, and after a long moment passed, it let out a sigh.</p><p>&#x201C;Lord Fifth is so handsome and debonair,&#x201D; it said, continuing to sigh, &#x201C;esteemed in all Heaven and Earth, a unique, beautiful bird. During this life, I&#x2019;ve never been able to have such a miraculous, heaven-defying creature. Why does Meng Hao suddenly get one&#x2026;. It&#x2019;s not fair, you dog-fart of a Heaven! It&#x2019;s not fair!&#x201D;</p><p>Meng Hao lifted his head up to look into the sky.</p><p>&#x201C;Parrot, it&#x2019;s time to remove whatever force you put on me to conceal me from the Heavenly Tribulation. The time has come to transcend my Gold Core Tribulation!&#x201D; His eyes glittered with an unprecedented glow. It was the glow of self-confidence, as well as a virtually imperceptible look of disdain.</p><p>The parrot glanced at Meng Hao, then flapped its wings. A multicolored glow shot out from it to cover Meng Hao&#x2019;s entire body.</p><p>As the multicolored glow passed over him, an aura suddenly emanated out from him with great intensity. This was not an aura from his Cultivation base, but rather undulations placed upon him by the parrot to conceal him from the Heavenly Tribulation.</p><p>Now that the undulations had revealed him, intense rumbling sounds immediately filled the sky. Deafening thunder rang out, reverberating out in all directions, covering everything for thousands of kilometers in all directions, shaking the land.</p><p>The lightning seemed to be furious, as if it had been searching for Meng Hao for a long time, and now that it found him, was filled with an awe-inspiring desire to crush him out of existence.</p><p>The sound of thunder reverberated around in the air; as it did, immense black clouds filled the sky, covering over everything. Layer upon layer rose up, emanating shocking sounds of thunder. Lightning twisted and crackled amidst the layers of clouds. The sight of it was astonishing.</p><p>As for the Western Desert Cultivators trapped within the spell formation, expressions of astonishment covered their faces. The face of the white-robed man from the Constellation Tribe, also caught within the fog, immediately fell.</p><p>&#x201C;That&#x2019;s&#x2026; Heavenly Tribulation!&#x201D;</p><p>Meng Hao looked up at the Tribulation clouds filling the skies, and the countless bands of silver lightning, twisting about like snakes. As the ear-splitting thunder sounded out, he coolly said, &#x201C;Get the Cultivators of the Church of the Golden Light out of here! Retreat them to a position fifteen hundred kilometers away! The rest of you, get fifteen hundred kilometers away too. For this Tribulation&#x2026; I will not need your assistance. This is MY Gold Core Tribulation!&#x201D;</p><p>The parrot hesitated for a moment, then flew up into the air. The meat jelly hovered off to the side, looking at Meng Hao. &#x201C;I hope you don&#x2019;t get killed by the lightning&#x2026;.&#x201D; it said solemnly. It put on an ancient and wizened appearance. &#x201C;If you do, there will be one less evildoer in the world. Don&#x2019;t worry, though, if the lightning does kill you, I won&#x2019;t be too heartbroken. In fact, I&#x2026;.&#x201D; Seemingly reveling in Meng Hao&#x2019;s misfortune, it was just making to leave when Meng Hao grabbed it.</p><p>&#x201C;Hey! What are you doing!?&#x201D; it howled furiously.</p><p>&#x201C;You don&#x2019;t get to leave,&#x201D; replied Meng Hao calmly. The vines surrounding Meng Hao instantly burrowed down into the ground and were gone in the blink of an eye. The parrot also shot away at top speed; within an instant, it was five hundred kilometers away.</p><p>At the same time, the parrot transmitted the information to the Cultivators of the Church of the Golden Light who were in the fog. They immediately began to scatter, fleeing as far away as possible. Soon, the only people around Meng Hao were the Western Desert Cultivators, emerging from the fog, expressions of shock on their faces.</p><p>During the same moment in which they caught sight of Meng Hao, massive thunderous booms sounded out from up above. The brutality of the sound itself threatened to cause everything around to collapse. Roughly thirty percent of the Western Desert Cultivators coughed up blood and then let out miserable shrieks as they realized they had been deafened.</p><p>Simultaneously, a bright red lightning bolt shot down toward Meng Hao from up above. As it descended, it attracted other nearby lightning toward it. By the time it was about to slam into Meng Hao, it was as thick as a human thigh.</p><p>The instant it was about to hit him, Meng Hao lifted his hand up with blinding speed. There in his hand was the meat jelly.</p><p>A boom echoed out, along with the miserable cry of the meat jelly, who instantly turned black. Meng Hao&#x2019;s body quivered as massive amounts of red sparks danced down his arm and then covered his entire body. They then passed down his feet to crawl across the ground, turning the snowy ground three hundred meters in all directions into a red lake of lightning!</p><p>&#x201C;So this is Heavenly Tribulation&#x2026;&#x201D; said Meng Hao, lifting his head up to laugh. &#x201C;Bring it on!&#x201D; His hair whipped around him, and his eyes filled with disdain as he laughed uproariously toward the Heavens.</p><p>&#x201C;Dammit, he&#x2019;s transcending the Tribulation! He&#x2019;s actually doing it!&#x201D; The nearby Western Desert Cultivators&#x2019; faces filled with shock. It was without hesitation that most of them retreated backward, their scalps numb. The only thing that they could think to do was flee.</p><p>However, some of them had a different idea. Killing intent flickered in their eyes as they shot toward Meng Hao.</p><p>&#x201C;Kill him, and the Heavenly Tribulation will go away!&#x201D; This was what they were thinking as they shot toward him as fast as possible, unleashing magical techniques to attack him.</p><p>&#x201C;How naive!&#x201D; said Meng Hao with a cold laugh, ignoring the incoming Cultivators. Even as they closed in on him, massive rumbling could be heard from the sky as another lightning bolt descended toward him.</p><p>This time, Meng Hao didn&#x2019;t use the meat jelly. That was because this particular lightning bolt, when it was about three hundred meters away from him, suddenly broke apart. It transformed into a dozen or so smaller lightning bolts that fell like rain onto both him and the Western Desert Cultivators who were charging him.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>&#x201C;Ahh, that&#x2019;s really scratching my itch,&#x201D; said Meng Hao with a laugh. After all his time dealing with the Heavenly Tribulation attacking him at intervals over the past months, his skin had grown a lot tougher. A bolt of Heavenly Tribulation lighting that could easily kill a Western Desert Core Formation Cultivator wouldn&#x2019;t so much as hurt Meng Hao.</p><p>He was used to it. Having experienced Heavenly Tribulation in a way that ordinary people could never even imagine, his body was now much more used to lightning.</p><p>As for these smaller lightning bolts, they really did feel like they were scratching an itch. When the lightning hit his body, all he felt was a little numbing sensation.</p><p>In fact, it was somewhat comfortable.</p><p>As for the dozen or so Western Desert Cultivators who had been trying to kill him, when the boom rang out, they were all instantly blackened into ash. Their magical techniques and treasures were destroyed like rotten wood.</p><p>Almost at the same time as Meng Hao&#x2019;s words rang out, their charred corpses toppled to the ground. Seeing this caused the other surrounding Western Desert Cultivators to gasp with shock.</p><p>Even the pupils of the eight Nascent Soul Cultivators constricted.</p><p>&#x201C;Is he even human?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Dammit, it looks like he&#x2019;s actually enjoying the Heavenly Tribulation. This guy is inhuman!&#x201D; The surrounding Cultivators were in an uproar. More were beginning to flee, wanting nothing more than to get out of the region of the Heavenly Tribulation. They could tell that only if they could get thousands of kilometers away would they be safe, and not attract the Heavenly Tribulation.</p><p>Suddenly, Meng Hao&#x2019;s voice echoed out, filled with coldness and killing intent. &#x201C;Congregation of the Church of the Golden Light! Encircle the surrounding three thousand kilometer area with the spell formation. Trap these people here! Do not let them step half a foot outside!&#x201D; Now that they were here with him, Meng Hao was disinclined to let them leave.</p><p>It didn&#x2019;t matter if they were Core Formation, Nascent Soul, or even the mysterious white-robed man from the Constellation Tribe. Meng Hao would keep them here to share in transcending the Tribulation!</p><p>&#x201C;Abide by the holy commands of the Patriarch!&#x201D; cried out the five thousand Cultivators. The sound of their voices turned into a powerful wave which fought back against the thunderous roars of the Heavens. It echoed out in all direction, filling the three thousand kilometer area. The five thousand Cultivators of the Church of the Golden light then began to run. As they did, a billowing fog suddenly rose up, and rumbling could be heard.</p><p>&#x201C;People are always asking me if I dare to fight. Well today, I ask you, who is there&#x2026; that dares to fight with Meng Hao!?&#x201D; He flicked his sleeve and accompanied the echo of his own voice as he flew forward toward the other Cultivators.</p><p>As he charged toward them, the sky rumbled with furious, crackling lightning that seemed to contain the might of the Heavens. A red bolt of lightning, even thicker than before, began to fall. It was when this happened that Meng Hao arrived in front of a group of a dozen or so Cultivators.</p><p>Their faces twisted, and in their hearts filled with enough curses that if they had the time, they would give voice to them for three days and three nights. Booms echoed out everywhere as the Heavenly Tribulation lightning bolt split, slamming into everyone present. Instantly, Meng Hao was surrounded by corpses. His body vibrated as sparks flowed down past his feet and across the ground. Again, he was surrounded by a lake of lightning dozens of meters in every direction. Meng Hao&#x2019;s laughter once again rang out.</p><p>&#x201C;Who dares to fight me!?&#x201D; he cried.</p><p>&#x201C;Dammit, this guy is a supernova of evil!&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Stay away! Stay away!&#x201D;</p><p>More booms filled the air. Everywhere Meng Hao went, lightning roared. Anyone within three hundred meters of him all became selfless, bosom buddies of Meng Hao, there to help him transcend the Tribulation&#x2026;.</p><p>Just as a bolt of Heavenly Tribulation lightning was descending to slaughter a dozen or so more people, killing intent suddenly gleamed in the eyes of the eight Nascent Soul experts. The Heavenly Tribulation had thrown the Qi in the area into chaos, making it impossible for them to use minor teleportation. Therefore, they all flew toward Meng Hao from different directions.</p><p>They couldn&#x2019;t use minor teleportation, but their speed was incredible. It took only a moment for them to be right on top of Meng Hao. The eight of them combined their powers into a single attack all aimed at Meng Hao.</p><p>&#x201C;DIE!!&#x201D; they screamed. They hated him to the bones. First he had trapped them, then directed lightning against them. All of that was caused by someone of the trifling Core Formation stage. They were determined to shred him to pieces, to make him understand that regardless of any circumstances, Core Formation Cultivators were like insects compared to the Nascent Soul stage.</p><p>Seeing this, the white-robed Cultivator from the Constellation Tribe&#x2019;s face suddenly flickered. Immediately, he cried out, &#x201C;Stop!&#x201D; However, he was too late.</p><p>With a slight smile and a cool look, Meng Hao ignored the eight attackers and looked up into the sky.</p><p>&#x201C;Just what is the might of the Heavens&#x2026;?&#x201D;</p><p>-----</p><p><em>This chapter was sponsored by Osamudiamen Igbinovia, Fran&#xE7;ois-Xavier Rondeau Valli&#xE8;res, Josh Lewis, Kevin Seba, Thomas Edwards, Dennis Liu, Konrad Wierzbicki, and Nicolas Gonzalez Cordero</em></p><p></p>
