<p><strong></strong></p><p>[/expand]</p><p>RUMBLE!</p><p>Blood sprayed out of Meng Hao&#x2019;s mouth as Lord White&#x2019;s divine abilities merged with each other and slammed into him. He had no choice but to fall back, his injuries worsening. By now, it was clear that his Eternal stratum&#x2019;s regenerative power could not match the magnitude of his injuries.</p><p>As for Lord White, he had his Green Emperor&#x2019;s Eternal Incantation, which was truly a mighty asset. In fact, to Meng Hao&#x2019;s consternation, it ensured that even though Lord White was in a difficult situation, he still was not at the end of the line.</p><p>Killing intent swirled in Lord White&#x2019;s eyes, but secretly, he was shocked and even terrified. His mind had been racing after everything he had just seen, and he had actually been able to put the pieces of the puzzle together and thus... identify who Meng Hao really was.</p><p>&#x201C;Lord of the Mountain and Sea Realm! The one and only Lord of the Mountain and Sea Realm.... If I can kill him, it will certainly be a huge detriment to the Mountain and Sea Realm. That would definitely count as an incredible meritorious service! I&#x2019;ll receive incredible rewards!&#x201D; The killing intent in his eyes grew even stronger. As soon as his attack had battered Meng Hao away, he suddenly raised his hand.</p><p>&#x201C;Mountain and Sea Scripture!&#x201D; he roared. Instantly, the ancient Mountain and Sea Scripture was projected behind him, radiating a mysterious light. Lord White suddenly clenched his hand into a fist, and then opened it.</p><p>&#x201C;The Mountains have three Daos. First Dao, Man-Mountain!&#x201D; Lord White performed a double-handed incantation gesture, causing the aura of the Mountain and Sea Scripture radiating from him to surge. When the words &#x2018;man&#x2019; and &#x2018;mountain&#x2019; left his mouth, his speed increased by an indescribable level, and he shot forward to appear directly in front of Meng Hao. Then he raised his hands up and shoved them forward.</p><p>That motion caused his body to transform into a mountain. His cultivation base surged, and a Heaven-destroying, Earth-extinguishing power slammed into Meng Hao.</p><p>Meng Hao didn&#x2019;t even have a chance to dodge. Rumbling sounds echoed out, and blood sprayed out of his mouth. His chest caved in, and even as he shot backwards, a bloody gleam appeared in Lord White&#x2019;s eyes.</p><p>&#x201C;Second Dao, Earth-Mountain!&#x201D; With that, he vanished again, to reappear beneath Meng Hao. There, he transformed into an even more majestic mountain, which instantly shot upward toward Meng Hao!</p><p>His speed was so great that Meng Hao was yet again incapable of evading. The mountain slammed into him, shattering his bones and sending blood spraying out of his mouth. His life force weakened, and despite the fact that he wanted to either dodge or defend himself, he simply couldn&#x2019;t.</p><p>&#x201C;Third Dao, Heaven-Mountain!&#x201D; The instant his voice rang out, he appeared up above Meng Hao as a mountain even more enormous and shocking than the previous two!</p><p>Then, he crushed down onto Meng Hao!</p><p>BOOOOMMMMMM!</p><p>Blood sprayed from Meng Hao&#x2019;s mouth. His cultivation base was crushed, and his fleshly body was on the verge of falling apart. Even as the Heaven-Mountain faded away, Meng Hao tumbled backwards like a kite with its string cut.</p><p>Lord White&#x2019;s eyes widened. &#x201C;Still not dead!?!?&#x201D;</p><p>The three Mountain Daos were peak Daoist magics of the Mountain and Sea Scripture. He rarely used them and, when he did, it always resulted in the death of his opponent.</p><p>But clearly, Meng Hao, despite being seriously injured, was not dead. This caused Lord White to frown, and his killing intent to rise.</p><p>However, things weren&#x2019;t much better for Lord White, and blood was currently oozing out of his mouth. The Mountains and Seas&#x2019; Three Daos and Three Magics were actually extremely difficult for him to control. &#x201C;The Seas have three magics....&#x201D;</p><p>Meng Hao was alarmed as he struggled to stay on his feet, and he immediately consumed some medicinal pills. His Eternal stratum was on the verge of being depleted, and his injuries were so severe that his organs were all shattered. In fact, his bones were only being kept from collapsing into fragments by sheer force of willpower. Whether it was his fleshly body or his cultivation base, Lord White&#x2019;s three attacks had virtually annihilated him.</p><p>Those three mountains left him in complete astonishment. He had never seen Daoist magics so shocking, and although they seemed relatively simple, their deadly attack power was beyond belief.</p><p>&#x201C;So that&#x2019;s the Mountain and Sea Scripture, huh...?&#x201D; he thought, panting. Then, he realized that apparently Lord White was about to unleash some other, similar Daoist magic. Shaken, he took advantage of this time when his opponent was preparing his next attack to suddenly walk in a very strange fashion.</p><p>Then, a brutal gleam appeared in his eyes as he murmured, &#x201C;Withering Flame!&#x201D;</p><p>Instantly, his body began to wither, as if he were burning his blood, transforming it into a flame that then raged outside of his body.</p><p>It was at this point that Lord White, eyes flickering with intense killing intent, unleashed his magical technique.</p><p>&#x201C;First magic, Commoner&#x2019;s Magic. The Commoner&#x2019;s lot is his body, exterminate the body to exterminate the magic!&#x201D; Lord White extended his hand and pointed his finger at Meng Hao. Instantly, the illusory ancient book behind him began to vibrate, and then, suddenly, Lord White actually vanished. When he reappeared, he was right in front of Meng Hao, towards whom he reached out with his finger.</p><p>That finger contained a bizarre magic, and Meng Hao sensed that if it touched him, his body would be broken and exterminated!</p><p>However, just before the finger touched him, Meng Hao&#x2019;s bizarre walking method suddenly caused the Dao of Time to be unleashed, and by the narrowest margin, he walked past Lord White, avoiding his finger attack. At the same time, a bizarre gleam appeared in Meng Hao&#x2019;s eyes.</p><p>&#x201C;Demon Magic!&#x201D; As soon as the words left his mouth, he began to emanate strange fluctuations, which merged with the flames, causing a stream of qi to fly out that rapidly formed a vortex.</p><p>Within that vortex, it was just possible to hear the sound of a beating heart that shook Heaven and Earth.</p><p>&#x201C;Second magic, the Minister&#x2019;s Magic. The Minister inherits the bloodline, exterminate the blood to exterminate the body!&#x201D; Roaring, Lord White waved his finger again, this time moving even faster. If this finger attack landed, then he would definitely destroy Meng Hao&#x2019;s blood.</p><p>However, in the moment before it landed, Meng Hao&#x2019;s shocking time-walking technique once again enabled him to barely avoid the danger. Lord White&#x2019;s face darkened, and he turned around to unleash the third magic!</p><p>&#x201C;Third magic, the Emperor&#x2019;s Magic. Everything under Heaven belongs to the Emperor; where his words reach, the Emperor&#x2019;s Magic is boundless!!&#x201D; As he spoke, he unleashed the third finger attack, and instantly, his finger tapped down onto Meng Hao&#x2019;s forehead!</p><p>It was as if this moment... had been fated to occur from the beginning!</p><p>A tremor ran through Meng Hao, and in the instant that the finger tapped onto his forehead, he spat, &#x201C;True Self Dao!&#x201D;</p><p>As the words were spoken, a blurry image appeared behind him that looked exactly like him in every respect!</p><p>BOOOOMMMMMM!</p><p>A massive boom rang out as the Emperor&#x2019;s Magic caused the non-illusory version of Meng Hao to be instantly killed. First his soul was destroyed, then his blood withered away, and finally his body collapsed into a pile of mangled gore.</p><p>As for the illusory version, it rapidly backed up.</p><p>At the same time, a strange gleam appeared in Lord White&#x2019;s eyes. Performing an incantation gesture, he spread his arms wide.</p><p>&#x201C;Star-Chain Eight Soulbanes, cut off the path of all souls being reborn!&#x201D; As soon as the words left his mouth, eight beams of red light shot up into the air, transforming into eight chains of blood which completely locked down the entire area. In the blink of an eye, rumbling filled the air as the entire starry sky was locked down!</p><p>Within that area, the chains cut off everything. They exploded with the intensity of rumbling lightning and shot toward the illusory image of Meng Hao.</p><p>&#x201C;Even if you have a rebirth magic that lets you send out a bit of your soul at a critical moment, you have been fated to die this day. My Eight Soulbanes is specifically designed to cut off the path of unattached souls. Your soul body will now be transformed into ash!&#x201D; Lord White was nearly purple from the effort it took to unleash the Mountain and Sea Scripture.The Three Daos and Three Magics of the Mountains and Seas were enormously powerful, and were incredibly high level techniques. In fact, rumor had it that they were collectively a Paragon magic, which meant that even Lord White was not qualified to unleash them easily. Every time he did, he had to pay an enormous price.</p><p>A boom rang out as the eight chains of blood, bursting with the power of soul-extermination, landed on the illusory version of Meng Hao. However, they ended up passing right through him without hurting him in the least.</p><p>This scene caused Lord White to stare in complete shock.</p><p>&#x201C;That&#x2019;s not a soul body?&#x201D;</p><p>Even as Lord White&#x2019;s face fell, that illusory figure suddenly turned completely clear. It was actually the real Meng Hao!</p><p>Both in terms of his facial features and his physical frame, he looked exactly like the person Lord White had just killed. However, this was no soul body, but rather, a genuine fleshly body, though it seemed somewhat gaunt, as if it had lost a lot of qi and blood!</p><p>Because it was a fleshly body, the Eight Soulbanes were completely useless against it!</p><p>That was because, in the moment before death, Meng Hao was well aware that he could not do any more to fight back against the Three Daos and Three Magics of the Mountain and Sea Scripture. Therefore, he chose to use another method, something that would have a similar effect as the Green Emperor&#x2019;s Eternal Incantation. And that was none other than the Withering Flame Demon Magic True Self Dao!</p><p>He simply... created a body substitution!</p><p>In the critical moment, he used some of his own qi and blood, along with the Withering Flame Demon Magic True Self Dao, to create a clone, a clone which could stand in his place to die!</p><p>&#x201C;Dammit!!&#x201D; Lord White&#x2019;s face fell, and he had to force himself to not cough up a mouthful of blood. The level of anger and frustration inside of him was impossible to describe. He had just paid an enormous price to unleash the Mountain and Sea Scripture&#x2019;s Three Daos and Three Magics. In terms of his longevity and the state of his body, both were a far cry from what they had been before.</p><p>He had been absolutely certain that Meng Hao was already dead, and had even unleashed his Eight Soulbanes. How could he ever have imagined that Meng Hao would have a body substitution magic!?</p><p>Now he was experiencing the same thing as Meng Hao had earlier when he had gone all out, regardless of the price, to make his killing move with the spear, only to be defeated by the Green Emperor&#x2019;s Eternal Incantation.</p><p>&#x201C;This kid has GOT to die!&#x201D; Lord White growled, glaring at Meng Hao. Gritting his teeth, he threw his hands up toward the starry sky, and a strange light gleamed in his eyes.</p><p>&#x201C;Star-Chain Eight Soulbanes, lock down the starry sky. Oh great Dao Fang, please descend to help me... destroy everything!&#x201D; As soon as the words left his mouth, the locked down section of the starry sky suddenly shuddered. Next, a roar of rage echoed out from within the void as an enormous figure suddenly appeared behind Lord White.</p><p>It was an enormous monkey holding a huge staff in its hand. Its eyes were crimson, and as soon as it looked over, Meng Hao&#x2019;s mind reeled with shock.</p><p>He had seen this figure before!!</p><p>An unsightly expression appeared on his face. He had managed to escape the deadly situation moments ago, but he had now lost the initiative. He was seriously injured, so badly that every move he made caused his entire body to teeter on the verge of collapsing.</p><p>As soon as he saw the image of that monkey, he instantly knew who it was. It was... Dao Fang!</p><p>Dao Fang, who had suppressed the Essence of Divine Flame!</p><p>However, as soon as the image of Dao Fang appeared, the Essence of Divine Flame inside of Meng Hao suddenly erupted beyond his control. It flowed out from him, spreading out to fill the area, with him at the center, creating an entire world of flame.</p><p>Gradually, within that sea of flames, a shocking will converged.</p><p>&#x201C;Dao Fang must die!!&#x201D; roared a voice filled with rage, enmity, and madness. At the same time, the Divine Flame began to form into a person.</p><p>It was a middle-aged man, wearing a set of flame armor, who was roaring at the image of the monkey.</p><p><strong>Chapter 1300: A Projection of Dao Fang!</strong></p><p></p><hr><p></p>
