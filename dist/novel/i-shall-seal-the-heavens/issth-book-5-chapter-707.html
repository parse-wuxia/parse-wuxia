<p><strong>Chapter 707: Subduing!</strong></p><p>It took Meng Hao only a single step forward to reach the first mountain peak. The instant he stepped foot onto it, all of Mount Ironblood shook. Inside their temple at the peak of the mountain, the faces of the two Ironblood Patriarchs flickered, and they erupted with shocking First Severing energy.</p><p>Rumbling filled Heaven and Earth, and the clouds and mist in all directions seethed. At the same time, an enormous face appeared in mid-air up above Mount Ironblood. It was completely the color of blood, and two horns protruded from its forehead.</p><p>It looked matchlessly vicious. As for the two Ironblood Patriarchs, their robes whipped madly in the wind, and in their hands they held enormous battle-axes.</p><p>The battle-axes were Demon Weapons; the two Patriarchs were facing a mortal enemy, and their hearts were trembling with great waves of shock.</p><p>&#x201C;I can&#x2019;t believe&#x2026; he&#x2019;s so powerful!!&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;What level is his cultivation base?! I can&#x2019;t see any traces of a Second Severing, but even at the great circle of the First Severing, he shouldn&#x2019;t have such powerful divine sense!&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Could it be that he cultivates some technique to specifically enhance his divine sense!?&#x201D;</p><p>The moment the two Patriarchs appeared was the same moment that Meng Hao stepped foot onto the stairs leading up to the peak of the first mountain. Slowly, he began to make his way toward the top.</p><p>All eyes were fixed on him, and everyone was thinking that as of this moment, Meng Hao really was worthy of his title after all.</p><p>On the second mountain peak, the scholarly looking child, Patriarch Darkheaven, could sense the result of the confrontation between the divine sense of Meng Hao and the two Ironblood Patriarchs. His face was covered with shock as he hastily stood, then instantly teleported out of his temple.</p><p>Outside, his seven apprentices gasped, and their faces filled with disbelief.</p><p>&#x201C;He resisted the divine sense of the two Ironblood Patriarchs all by himself!!&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Just&#x2026; just what type of cultivation base does he have!?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;What is he doing? Wasn&#x2019;t this just a test?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;QUIET!&#x201D; barked Patriarch Darkheaven. Shocked, his seven apprentices instantly went as silent as cicadas during winter.</p><p>On the fourth mountain peak, the three old men wreathed in flames also rushed out of their temple. Their expression were that of astonishment as they looked toward the first mountain peak.</p><p>Off to the side, the young man with the fan who had previously been observing the events with a look of disdain on his face, now stood there slack-jawed, seemingly incapable of even breathing.</p><p>He suddenly realized that this was not a situation in which the Blood Prince was being immature. Quite the opposite, his cultivation base was so high that he didn&#x2019;t need to bother with any sort of strategy or planning. He took out all of his opponents in one blow!</p><p>As soon as Meng Hao started up the staircase, the first, second, and fourth mountain peaks were sent into complete, reeling shock. In that same moment, the wind and clouds surged. A black fog appeared, within which could also be seen a white fog.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, black and white began to swirl around each other and form into the shape of two enormous pearls. Furthermore, beneath the two pearls was a mountain wreathed in mist and clouds!</p><p>The Ninth Mountain!</p><p>The Black White Pearls and the Ninth Mountain!</p><p>Together!</p><p>This was something that Meng Hao had come up with after his battle with Patriarch Six-Daos of the Black Sieve Sect. Although it was not complete, he was still able to use them to shocking effect.</p><p>Rumbling echoed out as the Black White Pearls and the Ninth Mountain crushed down onto the two Patriarchs of Mount Ironblood.</p><p>RUMBLE!</p><p>The ground trembled, and rumbling filled the air. The two Ironblood Patriarchs&#x2019; faces quivered.</p><p>Meanwhile, back on the fifth mountain peak, the hunchbacked old man&#x2019;s eyes widened, and he took a deep breath.</p><p>The pretty young woman who stood next to him was utterly shocked.</p><p>&#x201C;What&#x2026; what is he doing? Could he really be trying to fight back against Mount Ironblood? Master, didn&#x2019;t you say things wouldn&#x2019;t get serious?&#x201D;</p><p>The hunchbacked old man blinked and cleared his throat. &#x201C;Calm down, alright? Based on my experience, I can tell you that the matter definitely won&#x2019;t get extremely serious. At the most, the first mountain peak will be involved. Hahaha! It seems this Blood Prince is going to take it as a show of force!&#x201D;</p><p>In the central mountain peak, Mount Blood Demon, Patriarch Blood Demon&#x2019;s face was tranquil, but a smile of contentment could be seen on his face.</p><p>&#x201C;The ruthlessness in your heart is too intense, and can&#x2019;t be dispelled. You might as well let it condense into Devilishness. This has been a long time coming. It wasn&#x2019;t that I wanted to coerce you; rather, this was the only method that would count as being helpful to you.</p><p>&#x201C;You don&#x2019;t understand now, but when you reach your Third Severing, you will be enlightened.&#x201D;</p><p>Li Shiqi was also on Mount Blood Demon, and her eyes shone with a strange light as she watched the scene play out. After all, she knew Meng Hao much, much better than anyone else in the Blood Demon Sect.</p><p>The events in the ancient Demon Immortal Sect were imprinted indelibly in her heart, and she hadn&#x2019;t forgotten about anything that happened there. Furthermore, after returning, she told no one in the sect about what had happened, with the exception of Patriarch Blood Demon.</p><p>Most shocked of all was Wang Youcai. He stared blankly as everything happened, then began to breathe deeply. Determination began to glow in his eyes. &#x201C;Meng Hao&#x2026; is so strong! I&#x2026; can&#x2019;t let myself fall behind!&#x201D;</p><p>RUMBLE!!</p><p>A massive clamor filled the air as Meng Hao took his third step up the stairs. Up in mid-air, the pearls in the black and white mist, as well as the Ninth Mountain they orbited, shot toward the peak of the mountain. Under the force of the incredible pressure, the two Ironblood Patriarch&#x2019;s gigantic, ferocious face suddenly revealed an expression of pain.</p><p>Meng Hao&#x2019;s face was cold as he took his fourth step.</p><p>Shocking rumbling caused everything to shake. The face formed by the energy of the two Ironblood Patriarchs struggled and howled. However, it did no good. Under the crushing pressure, it shattered into countless fragments.</p><p>To the observers, it almost looked like half of the sky had been ripped apart, superseded by the Black White Pearls and the Ninth Mountain. Having seen their vicious face destroyed, the two Ironblood Patriarchs trembled and coughed up blood. In the blink of an eye, they seemed to age, and their faces filled with astonishment.</p><p>&#x201C;Just how powerful is he?!&#x201D; they thought, their minds reeling. In their wildest imaginations, they could never have guessed that Meng Hao, using only his own aura, could suppress them to this extent.</p><p>On the second mountain peak, Patriarch Darkheaven&#x2019;s face flickered as he stared at the Black White Pearls and the Ninth Mountain. &#x201C;What divine ability is that?!&#x201D;</p><p>The apprentices next to him were trembling, and so were rest of the 50,000 cultivators of the first mountain peak. They looked up at the sky, and at Meng Hao, and were terrified.</p><p>The three flame-cloaked figures on the fourth mountain peak watched on in shock.</p><p>&#x201C;Crushing! Now, that is crushing!&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;He didn&#x2019;t even attack them directly, he just used energy to pound the two Ironblood Patriarchs into such a tattered state!&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Blood Prince! He really is the Blood Prince!&#x201D;</p><p>Everyone was panting. In the Blood Demon Sect, respect was shown to the strong. Other than some of the Elite Apprentices who earned their place because of their bloodline, everyone else was now completely astonished by Meng Hao&#x2019;s show of force.</p><p>He took a fifth step.</p><p>Everything shook as the Black White Pearls and the Ninth Mountain continued to emit crushing pressure. The two Ironblood Patriarch&#x2019;s faces flickered, and with growling roars, they shot up into the air. However, even as they flew up, rumbling echoed out and they were swatted back down. They slammed into the top of the mountain, causing it to tremble violently as it sank down into the ground by a full three meters!</p><p>All observers were dumbfounded.</p><p>The two Ironblood Patriarchs coughed up blood. Their bodies were covered with wounds, and their astonishment regarding the Ninth Mountain and the Black White Pearls could not grow any further.</p><p>&#x201C;If we can&#x2019;t fight the divine ability, then we&#x2019;ll battle with his true self!&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;His magical techniques are monstrous. We can&#x2019;t fight from a distance, we need to get closer to attack!&#x201D;</p><p>The two Patriarchs roared, and their bodies emitted thumping sounds as they began to grow. They rapidly turned into thirty-meter tall, four-armed giants that looked like devilish fiends.</p><p>Their foreheads sported double horns, and they looked nothing at all like humans, but rather, Demons. Their energy exploded out violently as they hefted their battle-axes and then transforming into streaks of light that shot down toward Meng Hao with monstrous killing intent.</p><p>&#x201C;DIE!&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;KILL!&#x201D;</p><p>Meng Hao was taking his sixth step as they bore down on him. He glanced at the two Demons coldly, then lifted his right hand and slapped out violently.</p><p>His fleshly body had experienced sanctification and was essentially at the great circle of Spirit Severing. It was second only to Dao Seeking!</p><p>His cultivation base was at the Second Severing, but his true power&#x2026; placed him as the number one person under Dao Seeking in all the lands of South Heaven.</p><p>His palm roared through the air to land directly onto the two Demons.</p><p>A huge boom echoed out as the battle-axes shattered into pieces. The faces of the two Demons filled with astonishment, and blood sprayed out of their mouths. Miserable shrieks could be heard, and they appeared to be on the verge of exploding. Blood spurted out everywhere as they were sent tumbling backward.</p><p>Meng Hao&#x2019;s palm slammed them back up toward the peak of the mountain. At the same time, the Black White Pearls and the Ninth Mountain began to descend.</p><p>&#x201C;NOOO!!&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Patriarch, save us!!&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Darkheaven! Demonfire! Help us!&#x201D;</p><p>When the two Ironblood Patriarchs called out, bloody glows rose up from the second and fourth mountains. As they shot forward, a voice echoed out.</p><p>&#x201C;Enough!&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Your power has been established! Why haven&#x2019;t you stayed your hand!?&#x201D;</p><p>The ruthlessness in Meng Hao&#x2019;s eyes flickered as he took his eighth step.</p><p>&#x201C;SCREW OFF!&#x201D; he said, sending his divine sense exploding out. It transformed into a monstrous blood-colored beam that shot toward the incoming bloody glows. Its explosive intensity instantly shattered the two opposing beams, and they vanished.</p><p>&#x201C;Still want test me? Well then, take a good long look. I&#x2019;ve taken a liking to this Mount Ironblood.&#x201D; As his voice rumbled out, the Black White Pearls and the Ninth Mountain slammed down onto the peak of Mount Ironblood.</p><p>CRUSH!</p><p>Everything quaked, and a riot of colors flashed across the sky. The 50,000 disciples of the first mountain peak trembled as the two Ironblood Patriarchs screamed miserably. Their bodies were instantly smashed by the Ninth Mountain.</p><p>As their bodies were destroyed, their Nascent Divinities flew out, but were unable to escape. The Black White Pearls immediately absorbed them, and they were sealed inside.</p><p>In that moment, Meng Hao finished taking his eighth step, and reached the peak of the mountain. As he stood there alone, all of the disciples of the first mountain peak dropped trembling to their knees and began to kowtow.</p><p>&#x201C;We offer our respects, Blood Prince!&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;We offer our respects, Blood Prince!&#x201D;</p><p>The voices echoed out from the first mountain peak, rising into the air and spreading out like massive waves.</p><p>The entire Blood Demon Sect was filled with the sound of it.</p><p>However, even as the sound rolled out, a grim, penetrating voice could be heard.</p><p>&#x201C;Meng Hao, you might have a high cultivation base, but this is the Blood Demon Sect! Killing the torture chamber Patriarchs to usurp their position is against sect rules! You WILL provide compensation!&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Crushing the two Ironblood Fellow Daoists requires that you provide compensation!&#x201D;</p><p>The voices came from the second and fourth mountain peaks. Patriarch Darkheaven and the three Demonfire Patriarchs refused to give in, and in their minds, Meng Hao had already established his power. In their opinion, Patriarch Blood Demon would certainly appear soon. Since that was the case, they spoke up to maintain their own face, and make sure everyone knew that they did not fear the Blood Prince.</p><p>-----</p><p><em>This chapter was sponsored by Fabian M&#xFC;lle, Zaed Salman, Lukas A, and Daniel Jung</em></p><p></p><hr><p></p>
