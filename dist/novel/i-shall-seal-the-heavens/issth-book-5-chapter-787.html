<p><strong>Chapter 787: The Rise of a Blazing Sun!</strong></p><p>Of the powerful experts of the four powers that had waged war against the Blood Demon Sect, the Solitary Sword Sect Patriarch had perished in battle, as had the Black Sieve Sect Patriarch. Now, Patriarch Golden Frost transformed his life force into a sword, which slaughtered a Northern Reaches cultivator and then became ash in the wind.</p><p>As far as he was concerned, if the war with the Blood Demon Sect hadn&#x2019;t occurred, the Southern Domain would currently be much stronger. Even if the Northern Reaches did have eleven peak Dao Seeking experts, they still wouldn&#x2019;t have dared to send troops into the Southern Domain.</p><p>After all, the five great sects and three great clans had deep Dao reserves. Although they only had eight peak Dao Seeking cultivators, they did have several other Dao Seeking experts.</p><p>When you added in the precious treasures of the various sects and clans, it would have been more than enough to make the Northern Reaches cultivators pay a heavy price for any incursion.</p><p>But now&#x2026; all of that was mere wishful thinking.</p><p>&#x201C;Patriarch!!&#x201D; cried the Golden Frost Sect cultivators down below. Their minds were filled with grief as they watched their Patriarch fade away.</p><p>As for Patriarch Golden Frost, in his mind, he was atoning for his sins committed in the past.</p><p>Now there were only five peak Dao Seeking experts among the Northern Reaches forces. Unfortunately, the Southern Domain cultivators now only had the increasingly weakened Patriarch Song and Pill Demon, and then Meng Hao&#x2019;s second true self.</p><p>It was the three of them versus four peak Dao Seeking opponents!</p><p>Rumbling filled the air, and the fierce fighting continued down below. Heaven and Earth were wreathed in shadow, and the clouds churned. Miserable howls drifted through the air, as did the boom of magical techniques. In the final moments before death, some people chose to self-detonate. All of this transformed into something like a funeral dirge that echoed like thunder throughout all creation. Rivers of blood flowed wide and deep.</p><p>Down below, the number one most powerful person in the Northern Reaches, the Imperial Bloodline Clan Chief, had transformed into the shape of a Primordial Lightning Dragon. Lightning crackled out from his body, seemingly connecting all the way up to the sky. The power it contained as he shot toward Meng Hao was indescribable.</p><p>Meng Hao had rotated the Blood Demon Grand Magic to the pinnacle of its speed. Hundreds of thousands of enslaved souls, incapable of entering the cycle of reincarnation, had merged together to form a Blood Demon&#x2019;s head, with its vicious horn. The head was huge, and anyone who saw it couldn&#x2019;t help but be astonished.</p><p>This was a duel between a Primordial Lightning Dragon and a Blood Demon!</p><p>This was a battle that could possibly have actually occurred countless years in the past. Now, it was occurring again. The Primordial Lightning Dragon and the Blood Demon were once again locked in deadly combat!</p><p>In the blink of an eye, the Primordial Lightning Dragon and the Blood Demon slammed into each other. The Blood Demon Head shattered and then exploded into countless pieces.</p><p>Simultaneously, the Blood Demon&#x2019;s horn glittered like a sharp blade which sliced into the body of the Primordial Lightning Dragon, then slashed through it, splitting it completely in half.</p><p>A shocking boom rolled out, accompanied by the roar of the Lightning Dragon and towering Demonic qi from the Blood Demon head. It turned into a powerful blast that rapidly spread out in all directions.</p><p>All of the hundreds of thousands of cultivators on the battlefield were momentarily shaken into senselessness by the blast.</p><p>The Imperial Bloodline Clan Chief appeared in the spot where the Lightning Dragon dissipated, blood oozing out of his mouth. Veins bulged out of his forehead as he glared at Meng Hao.</p><p>Meng Hao trembled and coughed up a huge mouthful of blood. He staggered backward a few paces, and even as the Imperial Bloodline Clan Chief looked over, the lightning from his Lightning Cauldron covered him and he vanished. When he reappeared, he looked back to see a Northern Reaches cultivator standing in the spot he had just occupied.</p><p>As soon as he reappeared, Meng Hao stretched out his hands, causing vast quantities of red mist to spread out. The mist was apparently sentient, and it immediately shot toward thousands of nearby cultivators.</p><p>Miserable shrieks rang out across the battlefield as it bored into their bodies. One after another, the Northern Reaches cultivators&#x2019; bodies dried up and died; their qi, blood, cultivation bases and souls emerged and flew toward Meng Hao.</p><p>The Imperial Bloodline Clan Chief was in a rage. Lightning seemed to pulse in his eyes as he took a deep breath and caused his body to expand. In the blink of an eye he had turned into a thirty meter tall giant. As his long hair floated around him, he lifted his head and roared, a roar which contained a bizarre natural law. Everything around him ground to a halt.</p><p>It almost looked like everything around him was moving slower, whereas he was moving faster!</p><p>His body flashed as he shot toward Meng Hao and punched out.</p><p>Meng Hao&#x2019;s eyes glittered coldly. This old man was powerful, and considering his current cultivation base and divine abilities, was difficult to fight back against.</p><p>&#x201C;Unless&#x2026; I could use the sixth level of the Blood Demon Grand Magic!&#x201D; Meng Hao pushed his hand down toward the ground, then lifted it up, causing the thousands of corpses in the area to fly up and shoot like meteors toward the incoming Imperial Bloodline Clan Chief.</p><p>&#x201C;Time to die!&#x201D; cried the Imperial Bloodline Clan Chief, his voice echoing out coldly. The corpses crumbled to pieces, and he appeared in front of Meng Hao. His punch landed!</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Blood sprayed from Meng Hao&#x2019;s mouth as he suddenly vanished. He reappeared some distance away, where the Blood Demon Grand Magic suddenly surged into motion. The screams of thousands of surrounding cultivators once again rose into the air.</p><p>&#x201C;Dammit!!&#x201D; the Imperial Bloodline Clan Chief roared, enraged. He immediately shot forward in pursuit, in state of complete astonishment because of Meng Hao&#x2019;s gory technique. He couldn&#x2019;t allow Meng Hao to just sweep freely through the Northern Reaches cultivators. If he did, it wouldn&#x2019;t be long before that technique absorbed all of their lives.</p><p>&#x201C;It doesn&#x2019;t matter what age or era this evil technique appeared in, anyone would consider it Devilishly evil!&#x201D; he yelled. &#x201C;Everyone would rise together to destroy it! Cultivating a technique like this has doomed you to face the wrath of Heaven! You WILL meet a violent end!&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Magic is neither good nor evil,&#x201D; replied Meng Hao calmly. &#x201C;That exists only in the heart. You are incapable of harming the Dao heart of Meng Hao!&#x201D; He flickered to reappear in another location on the battlefield. The astonished Northern Reaches cultivators in the area tried to flee, but they weren&#x2019;t as fast as Meng Hao&#x2019;s red mist, which bored into their bodies and began to absorb them.</p><p>&#x201C;Let&#x2019;s see who&#x2019;s faster, you or me!&#x201D; said Meng Hao, his eyes flashing with the desire to kill. He could sense that he was just about to achieve the sixth level of the Blood Demon Grand Magic.</p><p>The Imperial Bloodline Clan Chief &#x2019;s eyes gleamed with a profound light as he ceased pursuit. Instead, he shot up into the air, his target being the location where the Northern Reaches&#x2019; peak Dao Seeking experts were fighting Patriarch Song and the others.</p><p>&#x201C;You kill Northern Reaches cultivators? Fine, I&#x2019;ll kill Southern Domain peak Dao Seeking cultivators!&#x201D;</p><p>As the Imperial Bloodline Clan Chief shot up into the air, Meng Hao&#x2019;s lips twisted into a cold smile. He stopped absorbing the life forces of the Northern Reaches cultivators and then caused the Lightning Cauldron to flicker. In response, the Imperial Bloodline Clan Chief laughed.</p><p>It only took a moment for his laughter to turn choked.</p><p>That was because Meng Hao had not switched places with someone nearby to block his path.</p><p>Instead&#x2026; he reappeared next to the two giants, who were barreling forward with the giant golden door and the huge tree.</p><p>&#x201C;Dammit, how insidious!&#x201D; thought the Imperial Bloodline Clan Chief, his face falling. &#x201C;This kid is vicious and merciless. If we don&#x2019;t get rid of him, it&#x2019;s going to be difficult to finish wiping out the Southern Domain!&#x201D; With that, he shot in Meng Hao&#x2019;s direction.</p><p>Meng Hao had reappeared directly next to one of the golden-armored giants, and a strange light gleamed in his eyes. Completely ignoring the fact that the Imperial Bloodline Clan Chief was closing in on him, he stretched his hands out. Rumbling could be heard as red mist exploded out from him.</p><p>It shot forward in the blink of an eye, boring into the body of one of the golden-armored giants, whose face then filled with astonishment. It let out a terrified howl.</p><p>Its body began to shake, and its eyes shone with an expression of unbearable suffering. Its body withered rapidly as its boundless qi, blood, cultivation base, and soul were rapidly extracted.</p><p>Its entire body withered in the blink of an eye. Cracking sounds could be heard as its legs, incapable of supporting the giant golden door, began to disintegrate. The giant then began to lean to the side, on the verge of collapsing.</p><p>It was then that the enraged Imperial Bloodline Clan Chief arrived. His fist slammed into Meng Hao, causing blood to spray from his mouth. Meng Hao immediately shot backward in retreat, his eyes shining with an extraordinary light.</p><p>&#x201C;Die!&#x201D; yelled the Imperial Bloodline Clan Chief, advancing at top speed. The Primordial Lightning Dragon appeared again, along with the roc, the python, as well as white tigers. The energy being unleashed was astonishing, and it all combined into a single punch.</p><p>Just when the punch was about to slam into Meng Hao&#x2026;.</p><p>The withered giant in the golden armor couldn&#x2019;t hold on any longer. Its life force vanished, and its corpse slammed into the ground. Massive amounts of red mist glittered brightly with the power it had absorbed.</p><p>The brilliance of the glow far exceeded that shown when Meng Hao had absorbed countless tens of thousands of Northern Reaches cultivators. As the red mist fused back into his body, he began to tremble.</p><p>The energy in his body was completely recovered, and the Blood Demon Grand Magic&#x2026; all of a sudden reached&#x2026;</p><p>The sixth level!</p><p>His energy was now vastly different than it had been moments before. Instantly, a blood colored tempest sprang up around him, stretching up high into the sky.</p><p>Within him, the Blood Demon Grand Magic was rotating at the pinnacle of speed. Meng Hao raised his hand in a palm strike that surged directly toward the incoming Imperial Bloodline Clan Chief.</p><p>A vortex appeared around the palm. At first it was only three meters across, but it rapidly expanded to three hundred meters. It looked like a huge mouth, biting voraciously toward the Imperial Bloodline Clan Chief.</p><p>For the first time, the Imperial Bloodline Clan Chief felt a sense of deadly crisis. He immediately put all the power he could muster into his own strike.</p><p>A shocking, thunderous boom echoed out!</p><p>The Imperial Bloodline Clan Chief was consumed by the vortex. A moment later, an enraged roar could be heard, and the vortex collapsed. From within, a blood-soaked figure flew out.</p><p>It was the Imperial Bloodline Clan Chief. He was severely wounded, with blood spurting out of various wounds. An expression of astonishment could be seen on his face as he realized that twenty percent of his power had been withered away in the brief moment that had just passed.</p><p>The collapsed vortex immediately flowed back into Meng Hao. A tremor ran through him as his fleshly body grew even more powerful. In fact, even a bit of Immortal will could be detected!</p><p>His cultivation base also surged with rumbling power.</p><p>He hovered in midair, the blood-colored tempest raging around him, the Lightning Cauldron crackling with electricity, his hair whipping around. He looked like a Paragon!</p><p>He glanced down coldly at the Imperial Bloodline Clan Chief, and the aura of a Paragon grew even more intense. Colors flashed in the sky and the wind screamed. The hundreds of thousands of cultivators on the ground, even the peak Dao Seeking experts locked in combat up above, were all completely shocked.</p><p>Meng Hao looked like a blazing sun, rising up with infinite splendor!</p>
