<p><strong>Chapter 695: Attack the Black Sieve Sect!</strong></p><p>Meng Hao&#x2019;s appearance on the scene shook the Heavens and rocked the Earth. Everything trembled, and enormous, endless ripples spread out.</p><p>A massive roaring echoed out as the war chariot appeared, shattering the air. Meng Hao stood in the middle of the war chariot as cracking sounds filled the air; countless fissures sprang into being.</p><p>The entire sky was like a mirror that someone had punched their fist into. Although it was not completely shattered, shocking cracks could be seen spreading out in all directions.</p><p>That was especially true because of the flag of three streamers that he wielded. This was his first time truly and intentionally unleashing the full, incredible power of the flag. It whipped about, its blackness covering everything, splitting the sky into two worlds, one of light, one of darkness.</p><p>Meng Hao&#x2019;s eyes were completely bloodshot as his gaze swept over the scene in the Black Sieve Sect; he saw the black mist, and he saw the domineering lotus flower!</p><p>He sent his divine sense out, but the lotus spell formation and the black mist therein formed a great spell formation that completely protected the mountains of the Black Sieve Sect. This was no ordinary spell formation; even Meng Hao&#x2019;s powerful divine sense could not penetrate inside.</p><p>His killing intent instantly surged.</p><p>&#x201C;Black Sieve Sect!&#x201D; he shouted. The sound rumbled about, more intense than lightning. His fleshly body was at the peak of Spirit Severing, and his cultivation base was at the peak of the Second Severing. This was the first time he had ever shouted in such a way after entering the Eternal stratum. He pushed his hand down onto the chariot, and instantly, the flag of three streamers swished. The blackness, which was like nighttime consuming light, swept toward the huge lotus that surrounded the Black Sieve Sect. Booms could be heard echoing out.</p><p>Heaven and Earth trembled, and the sound of explosions filled the air. The lotus instantly collapsed, but then reappeared. Apparently, the aura of the Hundred Thousand Mountains was sustaining what would be an endless succession of enormous spell formations.</p><p>Because of Meng Hao&#x2019;s shout, as well as the collision between the flag of three steamers and the great spell formation, the ground quaked violently. The sounds merged together, creating a shocking barrage that rattled out in all directions, even into the black mist within the Black Sieve Sect.</p><p>The disciples of the Black Sieve Sect suddenly could all hear Meng Hao&#x2019;s enraged voice.</p><p>&#x201C;Hand over Xu Qing!&#x201D; he said. This was his second sentence. The power of his words far exceeded that of his first sentence. An even more shocking rumbling shook everything; the lotus dimmed and the mist seethed. All of the Black Sieve Sect disciples felt their minds trembling violently.</p><p>The beautiful palace buildings began to shake, and some even collapsed under the power of Meng Hao&#x2019;s voice. The eyes of the Black Sieve Sect disciples in the Ninety-Nine Mountains went wide with shock.</p><p>The three old men who sat cross-legged around the incense burner on the First Mountain opened their eyes. Bright glows could be seen.</p><p>&#x201C;Spirit Severing!&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Second Severing!&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;A powerful expert!&#x201D;</p><p>When they exchanged glances, they could all see the serious look in each others&#x2019; eyes.</p><p>&#x201C;We only activated the spell formation to be prepared for all contingencies and to prevent other sects from detecting what was happening. Who is this stranger?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;It doesn&#x2019;t matter who he is. Even if he&#x2019;s a Spirit Severing expert, now that he&#x2019;s come to the Black Sieve Sect, he&#x2019;ll be forced to drop to his knees in front of us!&#x201D;</p><p>The three men muttered to themselves for a moment before the Third Severing old man gave a cold snort. &#x201C;He can&#x2019;t even get inside! Continue with the dissolving!&#x201D;</p><p>Surrounded by rumbling sounds, the hundreds of thousands of Black Sieve Sect disciples once again continued with their refinement, causing the incense burner glowed bright red. As for the figure inside, when she heard Meng Hao&#x2019;s voice, she suddenly trembled.</p><p>&#x201C;He&#x2026; came&#x2026;.&#x201D;</p><p>Outside of the Black Sieve Sect&#x2019;s spell formation, Meng Hao&#x2019;s eyes were completely shot with blood. He raised his hand and caused the flag of three streamers to swish through the air. Blackness roiled out to slam into the Black Sieve Sect&#x2019;s spell formation.</p><p>The incredible booms continued to rattle out. The great lotus spell formation suddenly rotated, causing the power of Heaven and Earth to emanate out. The power was indestructible, seemingly eternal. No matter what Meng Hao did to cause the formation to collapse, it would instantly restore itself.</p><p>A short period of time passed in which it seemed nothing would work.</p><p>The disciples of the Black Sieve Sect were now starting to calm down and focus on their orders from the sect. The dissolving continued. As for the old men surrounding the incense burner, cold smiles twisted their lips as they proceeded with the refinement.</p><p>They were not worried. The protective spell formation was so powerful that nothing could compare to it, except perhaps a Dao Seeking cultivation base. Any Spirit Severing expert who tried to break through the formation wouldn&#x2019;t be able to do so unless they spent months trying.</p><p>As for the refinement process, they only needed a few more days to finish&#x2026;. Then they would be able to go against this opponent with the full strength of the sect. Even if he was a Second Severing cultivator, he would be dead for sure.</p><p>&#x201C;How rash and ridiculous,&#x201D; said the Third Severing old man, his voice cool.</p><p>Meng Hao stood in the war chariot glaring at the enormous lotus. He had already destroyed the damnable thing at least a hundred times with the flag of three streamers.</p><p>However, no matter how many times he shattered it into pieces, it would completely recover, seemingly completely undamaged.</p><p>&#x201C;They mustered all the power of Heaven and Earth from all Hundred Thousand Mountains of the Black Sieve Sect to back this spell formation&#x2026;. What I&#x2019;m fighting against is not the formation, but the power of Heaven and Earth from these Hundred Thousand Mountains!</p><p>&#x201C;If the power of Heaven and Earth doesn&#x2019;t break up, then the formation cannot be pierced!</p><p>&#x201C;If only... I could use just a bit of Dao Seeking power to force the spell formation to reach its limit. Break it at least ten times in a row, to the point where the spiritual energy from the Hundred Thousand Mountains can&#x2019;t keep up. Then I can see its weak points!</p><p>&#x201C;One point of weakness is all I need to completely shatter it.&#x201D; Meng Hao lifted his right hand and made a grasping motion, causing the flag of three streamers to return to him. It swirled through the air around him, almost like a black cloak that covered his green robe.</p><p>He placed his hand onto the war chariot and rotated Immortal Shows the Way, sending pulses of Immortal qi into the chariot.</p><p>&#x201C;Unfortunately, I don&#x2019;t have the power of Dao Seeking!</p><p>&#x201C;Even the flag of three streamers can&#x2019;t smash through this succession of spell formations. Well then&#x2026; I&#x2019;ll just have to bash it head on!&#x201D; A light of madness shone in Meng Hao&#x2019;s eyes.</p><p>He would not attempt to pierce it; he would smash head on into the formation!</p><p>The war chariot began to thrum, and countless magical symbols appeared, along with numerous roaring wild beasts that began to pull it forward into a charge.</p><p>The incredible speed was difficult to describe. In the blink of an eye, the war chariot had left its original position and&#x2026; was shooting like a meteor directly into the lotus, bashing into it.</p><p>The lotus instantly fell apart, but almost at exactly the same time, began to reform.</p><p>However, the war chariot continued onward, charging forward without stop. It was like a sharp sword, stabbing madly, allowing no time for the spiritual energy of the Hundred Thousand Mountains to rush forward.</p><p>&#x201C;Ninth Anima!&#x201D; roared Meng Hao. His body was powerful to the extreme, and his Cultivation base exploding with full power. Although this was not the power of Dao Seeking, he was emminently qualified to be called the number one figure under Dao Seeking.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The war chariot shot forward another three hundred meters. Meng Hao&#x2019;s body trembled, and vast pressure bore down on him. However, nothing could prevent him from advancing. Nothing could stand in the way of the war chariot; it was like caged animal that roared as it charged forward.</p><p>The further they got, the greater was the pressure that weighed down on them. The interior of the lotus collapsed, but as before, began to heal. The Hundred Thousand Mountains rotated, and the spiritual energy poured out boundlessly. Meng Hao raised his hand up and then pointed out.</p><p>&#x201C;Demon Sealing, Eighth Hex!</p><p>&#x201C;Seal the spiritual energy of these hundred thousand mountains!&#x201D;</p><p>An incredible roar filled the air as the Hundred Thousand Mountains shuddered. Meng Hao shouted out as the war chariot charged forward madly, another three hundred meters. It was now only about six hundred meters from the position where the black mist began.</p><p>It was at this point that violent shaking overtook the Hundred Thousand Mountains. Some of the outermost mountains, perhaps a thousand in total, began to split and crack and then directly exploded.</p><p>They simply couldn&#x2019;t endure the way Meng Hao fought back against them. After having their spiritual energy sealed, a backlash occurred that instantly shattered them!</p><p>As thousands of huge mountains collapsed in the Black Sieve Sect&#x2019;s Hundred Thousand Mountains, the faces of the disciples of the Black Sieve Sect fell. As for the three old men who sat next to the incense burner, their pupils constricted.</p><p>One of them gave a cold snort, then lifted his hand up and pointed out.</p><p>&#x201C;Send 10,000 disciples to form a spell formation. Use deadly force. If they&#x2019;re capable of killing him, kill him. If they can&#x2019;t kill him, delay him for three days.&#x201D;</p><p>In response to his words, a group of 10,000 disciples flew up into the air. They shot through the black mist and then entered the lotus spell formation to sit down cross-legged on the lotuses inside. They unleashed their cultivation bases as they took control of the lotus spell formation.</p><p>In unison with their actions, the lotus spell formation began to rotate, sending out pulses of killing will. In the blink of an eye, innumerable lotus petals flew out, sweeping toward Meng Hao like sharp swords.</p><p>The lotus petals almost looked like rain, filled with a desire to kill. However, before they could even get near to Meng Hao, his eyes radiated murder and madness. He pushed the war chariot onward, then waved his wide sleeve. The flag of three streamers shot out, sweeping out with echoing booms. The 10,000 disciples who had just emerged from the black mist trembled and began to cough up blood.</p><p>As for Meng Hao and the war chariot, they shot forward with urgency, fighting back against the pressure which weighed down. They moved another three hundred meters. By this point, Meng Hao felt as if a hundred thousand mountains really were pressing down onto his body.</p><p>They would soon crush him into a pulp.</p><p>As for the Immortal qi inside of him, he couldn&#x2019;t control it any more. It would be difficult to push the war chariot through the final three hundred meters. A bright glow appeared in Meng Hao&#x2019;s eyes as, without hesitation, he put the war chariot away and then relied on the strength of his fleshly body to continue on through the last three hundred meters.</p><p>As soon as he proceeded forward, the pressure from the Hundred Thousand Mountains bore down. Meng Hao trembled, and cracking sounds could be heard. He stopped in place. Seeing him stop moving caused the 10,000 disciples to feel a bit more confident. They all began to perform incantations, causing the lotuses they were sitting on to teleport forward toward Meng Hao. Shockingly, the lotuses started forming together into a huge statue of a three headed, six-armed god.</p><p>The statue was incredibly formidable. Not only did it have three heads and six arms, but lotuses swirled around it, and it was formed from 10,000 people! The three heads all looked at Meng Hao, and the six arms all pointed directly at him.</p><p>&#x201C;Screw off from this place!&#x201D; roared the statue with the combined voices of 10,000 people. Meng Hao looked up with a vicious smile. The killing intent in his eyes was thick, and his desire to slaughter suddenly surged even higher.</p><p>Ninth Anima. Second Spirit Severing cultivation base. Eternal stratum. All of this thrummed inside of Meng Hao. He strode forward, clenching his right hand into a fist.</p><p>One man versus a great spell formation, and 10,000 enemies.</p><p>&#x201C;Time to break you!&#x201D; he cried.</p><p>-----</p><p><em>This chapter was sponsored by Sid from India, Roman Cvijanovic, Hieu Phan Trung, Joenathan Tanumihardja, Christopher Choi, and Daniel Jackson</em></p>
