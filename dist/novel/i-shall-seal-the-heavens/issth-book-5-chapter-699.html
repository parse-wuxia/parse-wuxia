<p><strong>Chapter 699: Sieve Yin Sect</strong></p><p>&#x201C;That&#x2019;s Meng Hao!!&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Violet Furnace Lord Meng Hao of the Violet Fate Sect! He even came to the Black Sieve Sect once to give a lecture about the Dao of alchemy!!&#x201D;</p><p>It had been silent before, but suddenly, the sound of gasping filled the air as everyone suddenly thought the same thing.</p><p>&#x201C;Two hundred years ago he was in Core Formation&#x2026;. But now, he can slaughter Spirit Severing Patriarchs!!&#x201D;</p><p>Meng Hao completely ignored the astonished buzz of conversation. He stared straight at the Third Severing Patriarch and slowly walked forward.</p><p>As he neared, an enormous, energy rose up from Meng Hao&#x2019;s body, which transformed into an incredible pressure that covered over everything. The hubbub instantly died down, and even the wind ceased to blow. The only thing left behind was the indescribable pressure.</p><p>At the moment, it was evening, and the sky was just starting to turn dark.</p><p>&#x201C;The Sieve Yin Sect! Her soul is in the Sieve Yin Sect!!&#x201D;</p><p>When the Third Severing Patriarch felt the pressure, and saw Meng Hao&#x2019;s gaze fixed upon him, his heart grew numb, and a sense of despair filled him. He was certain that if he didn&#x2019;t tell Meng Hao what he wanted to know, he would die this day. It was then that he remembered that the Sieve Yin Sect was actually the true Dao Reserve of the Black Sieve Sect, so he quickly blurted out the name.</p><p>The Black Sieve Sect was divided like Yin and Yang.</p><p>In accord with that division, it was split into two factions. On the surface was the Black Yang Sect. However, beneath the Hundred Thousand Mountains was the Sieve Yin Sect!</p><p>The two factions were inextricably linked, which was how the name of the Black Sieve Sect came to exist in the Southern Domain.</p><p>Of course, Meng Hao was not aware of this, but he did know a bit about the Black Sieve Sect. He knew about the countless discarnate souls that existed underground. It was years ago that he had first sensed the discarnate soul of Matriarch Phoenix in Xu Qing.</p><p>He also knew that some Chosen of the Black Sieve Sect had Sieve Yin Sect souls hidden within them.</p><p>As for which of the two factions occupied the position of leadership, and which was subservient, well&#x2026; no outsider knew the answer to that question.</p><p>Meng Hao said nothing in response. He simply lifted his right hand up, performed an incantation and then pushed his hand down toward the ground.</p><p>As he did, his Demon Sealer&#x2019;s aura exploded out. As a result, the Demonic Qi of Heaven and Earth in the area surged toward him in a constant flow. It swept about, causing his view of the entire world to change instantly.</p><p>Shockingly, he could see that the land was covered with boundless auras of sinister death. The auras swirled together to form a vortex that actually existed in the ground deep beneath the Black Sieve Sect.</p><p>Gradually, he could also make out what appeared to be a turbid river flowing underneath the surface of the ground. It was surrounded by countless discarnate souls. Surrounding the river were ten enormous, illusory palaces that floated in the air, which seemed to be guarding the river.</p><p>In the center of the ten palaces was an altar formed from bleached bones. It was filled with a bizarre, awe-inspiring aura, and above it floated a black, crystal ball. Within that crystal ball was a soul, apparently sleeping.</p><p>As soon as he saw the soul, Meng Hao&#x2019;s entire body began to shake.</p><p>It was&#x2026; Xu Qing.</p><p>Beneath the crystal ball were four blurry figures sitting there cross-legged. A sinister aura of death radiated off of them, which made it clear that these four figures were corpses that had been there for countless years.</p><p>The moment in which Meng Hao saw the four corpses, they all lifted their heads. Bizarre, underwordly light shone in their eyes as they looked at Meng Hao.</p><p>There were four corpses, but it was three wills that suddenly exploded out in Meng Hao&#x2019;s mind.</p><p>&#x201C;Screw off!&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Get the hell out of here!&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;This is not a place you can enter. If you don&#x2019;t screw off within three breaths of time, you&#x2019;ll end up remaining here forever!&#x201D;</p><p>In response, Meng Hao lifted his foot up and then stamped it down onto the ground. The surface of the land rumbled, and a huge fissure opened up. Determination filled his eyes as he shot down into the fissure.</p><p>As soon as he entered, a sinister, cold aura rose up. Furthermore, countless discarnate souls emerged from within the river. Their eyes glowed with strange lights, as well as greed, as they shot toward Meng Hao.</p><p>An archaic voice echoed out from the turbid waters below: &#x201C;In the Yellow Springs, the discarnate souls of Heaven and Earth see not the sun. They wish only to remain buried in the depths!&#x201D;</p><p>The countless discarnate souls shot forward, causing an evil wind to spring up.</p><p>A strange light gleamed in Meng Hao&#x2019;s eyes as he proceeded onward three hundred meters. He slowly extended his right hand toward the tens of thousands of incoming discarnate souls. Then, he chopped his hand down, creating an illusory blade imbued with his Dao.</p><p>The slash of this blade was like the slash of the Dao! [1. Don&#x2019;t forget that &#x201C;blade&#x201D; and &#x201C;Dao&#x201D; have almost the same pronunciation]</p><p>This blade contained Meng Hao&#x2019;s Dao of freedom and independence. His life was a journey, and he would be free and unfettered! This Dao was a severing of fetters!</p><p>Rumbling filled the air as, in the blink of an eye, the blade grew to 3,000 meters in length. It slashed down, sending out monstrous ripples that swept about in all directions. As the blade swept out, countless discarnate souls let out miserable shrieks, and burst into flames.</p><p>Meng Hao proceeded forward another measure, advancing six hundred meters. He was now only 1,500 meters from the altar. At the same time, ten streams of divine will appeared from within the ten palaces that surrounded the altar. They shot forward, carrying with them auras of death. Shockingly, they transformed into 100,000 discarnate souls, all of them with eyes full of avarice. As they flew through the air, they merged together to form what appeared to be a waning moon that sped toward Meng Hao.</p><p>Meng Hao lifted his hand again, and when it descended, a second blade appeared!</p><p>This was his second Dao, the severing of Perfection and the acquisition of a new life. It contained his determination, his will, and his enlightenment. As the blade descended, Heaven and Earth shook, as if a great Dao were arriving. In front of Meng Hao, it transformed into a blade that exceeded the 3,000 meter length of the previous blade.</p><p>The blade slashed toward the moon!</p><p>Booming sounds rattled out in all directions!</p><p>Wherever the ripples of the blade passed, the discarnate souls screamed miserably. The waning moon emitted a bright glow as it attempted to fight back.</p><p>When the two slammed into each other, the waning moon trembled. Meng Hao&#x2019;s blade slashed directly into its center, completely slicing it in two. It instantly shattered into pieces.</p><p>When the waning moon exploded, the ten temples trembled. All of the discarnate souls in the area looked completely astonished. Even as the waning moon began to reform, Meng Hao waved his hand and pointed.</p><p>&#x201C;Demon Sealing, Eighth Hex!&#x201D;</p><p>RUMBLE!</p><p>Demon Sealing magic was incredibly potent when used against the discarnate souls; the waning moon shuddered, and instantly began to disperse. At the same time, countless disconsolate wails could be heard echoing about.</p><p>&#x201C;It&#x2019;s him!&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;It&#x2019;s the Demon Sealer from that year!!&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;He&#x2019;s a Demon Sealer!!&#x201D;</p><p>Even as the voices rang out, Meng Hao advanced a third time, crossing a span of 1,500 meters to directly near the altar. At the same time, three of the four figures opened their eyes and lifted their hands to point toward Meng Hao.</p><p>&#x201C;Discarnate Soul Dao! Dao of Soul Destruction!&#x201D;</p><p>Shockingly, these three corpses had cultivation bases at the Third Spirit Severing level. When they attacked simultaneously, the power was shocking, causing the surroundings to suddenly sink into an illusory world where it seemed Heaven and Earth were transposed. In front of Meng Hao, a vortex appeared.</p><p>The vortex, which seemed capable of consuming anything living or dead, sped directly toward Meng Hao.</p><p>If that were all there were to it, it wouldn&#x2019;t be a big deal. However, before Meng Hao could employ any divine abilities, the fourth figure on the altar opened his eyes, rose to his feet, and began to walk toward Meng Hao.</p><p>&#x201C;I am the Yin Divinity. I neither descend to the underworld nor ascend to the shining Heavens. I control my own reincarnation. I possess the Yellow Springs of the Ninth Mountain&#x2026;.&#x201D; As he spoke, he passed through the vortex to appear in front of Meng Hao. He lifted his hand and pointed out.</p><p>The gesture caused what appeared to be an illusory, yellow-colored river to appear above his hand. Something appeared to exist inside the illusory image, and it struggled to emerge, releasing an incredible will of death.</p><p>The finger attack caused Meng Hao&#x2019;s entire body to fill with rumbling, along with an intense sense of deadly crisis. In his estimation, this person&#x2026; was even stronger than the three people from moments ago!</p><p>&#x201C;Back on that ancient ship, I came to understand two types of Daoist magic&#x2026;.&#x201D; Meng Hao&#x2019;s eyes glittered as he took a deep breath, and then began to perform an incantation. In the blink of an eye, the Mountain Consuming Incantation appeared.</p><p>This incantation was something he had acquired in the ancient Demon Immortal Sect. It was not the most powerful magic, however, as far as Meng Hao could tell, the limits of its power likely depended on which mountain was being replicated!</p><p>Ordinary mountains, such as the Black Sieve Sects&#x2019; Hundred Thousand Mountains, or perhaps other mountains in the Southern Domain, would be incapable of fighting back against this vortex.</p><p>&#x201C;The most powerful mountain that I have had a chance to study&#x2026; is the Ninth Mountain!&#x201D; Meng Hao&#x2019;s eyes went blank. One breath of time later, shockingly, the image of a mountain appeared in his pupils.</p><p>It was a mountain that towered among the stars, a boundless, enormous mountain that defied description.</p><p>The Ninth Mountain!</p><p>As soon as the Ninth Mountain appeared in his eyes, it also manifested in his palm. He lifted his hand up, and the Ninth Mountain grew in size. Along with it, indescribable ripples began to flow out from within it.</p><p>The self-proclaimed Yin Divinity discarnate soul in front of Meng Hao suddenly looked shocked, and it began to tremble involuntarily.</p><p>&#x201C;That&#x2019;s&#x2026; the Ninth Mountain!</p><p>&#x201C;To produce a copy of the Ninth Mountain requires incredible destiny and good fortune!</p><p>&#x201C;Not only have you summoned an image of the Ninth Mountain, but you&#x2019;ve summoned it into your palm! Such an action requires incredible luck, as well as&#x2026; vast audacity!</p><p>&#x201C;How are you capable of all of this! How could you possibly have had a chance to lay eyes on the entirety of the Ninth Mountain?!?!&#x201D;</p><p>He was shocked, as were the three discarnate souls on the altar behind him. Their faces filled with complete disbelief as they looked at the Ninth Mountain.</p><p>It must be said that South Heaven is only one of the four planets that orbited the Ninth Mountain. That made the Ninth Mountain&#x2026; something of supreme importance, above all living things!</p><p>To summon an image of the Ninth Mountain, was like summoning Heaven and Earth!</p><p>&#x201C;If he can summon the image of the Ninth Mountain, that means that if he can achieve Immortal Ascension he will have a Mountain Consuming qi! This man cannot be allowed to develop any further!</p><p>&#x201C;He only has the image of the mountain, not the will! Destroy him, seize his blood, wrest away his fortune! Transform this into a great success for the Sieve Yin Sect!&#x201D;</p><p>Instantly, the three discarnate souls on the altar shot out.</p><p>It seemed that they were just about to slam into Meng Hao, when suddenly a vast power from the Heavens above suddenly descended to the lands of the South Heaven. As it neared, South Heaven shook and trembled.</p><p>This was a great Dao. This was the arrival of the will of the real Ninth Mountain!</p><p>The will arrived because Meng Hao replicated its image. It descended because of the mountain in his hand!</p>
