As far as he was concerned, there was now nothing to worry about. He had never heard of any neo-demon capable of resisting a Demon Nurturing Pill.</p><p>However, it took only a moment for his expression to fill with shock. It wasn&#x2019;t just him; all of the surrounding members of the Crow Scout Tribe were all staring with wide eyes at the five Greenwood Wolves. They simply couldn&#x2019;t believe it.</p><p>Big Hairy hadn&#x2019;t even opened his eyes, and was still napping. Hairy #2 and the others had odd expressions on their faces. They sniffed the air and then looked with confusion over at Meng Hao.</p><p>Meng Hao didn&#x2019;t say anything. All of the wolves, except for Big Hairy, resumed their playing. As for Mo Fang and his Demon Nurturing Pill, they were completely ignored.</p><p>The neo-demons of the surrounding Tribe members were going crazy, whereas the Greenwood Wolves were completely calm. The sight of it caused Mo Fang&#x2019;s brain to be filled with what seemed like the explosion of thunder.</p><p>Nobody spoke. Nearly a hundred people all seemed as if they couldn&#x2019;t even breathe.</p><p>&#x201C;Impossible&#x2026;.&#x201D; said Mo Fang. &#x201C;How could this be? This&#x2026; this is a Demon Nurturing Pill. There&#x2019;s not a single neo-demon that could possibly resist it&#x2026;.&#x201D; His face was pale; what was happening was a huge blow to him. He staggered backward, muttering to himself and staring at his most precious, treasured Demon Nurturing Pill. Then he looked back at the five Greenwood Wolves.</p><p>His felt his mind reeling, and a look of confusion filled his eyes. Suddenly, he began to doubt himself.</p><p>Meng Hao gave a dry cough. He felt a bit bad for Mo Fang. If the man had pulled out some other item, perhaps it could have attracted the attention of Big Hairy and the other wolves. But to the wolves, this supposedly precious Demon Nurturing Pill was absolutely valueless.</p><p>From the time they were small, they had been raised on the Frigid Snow Clan&#x2019;s Demon Nurturing Pill. Most importantly, even the Frigid Snow Clan couldn&#x2019;t concoct a Demon Nurturing Pill of the same quality as Meng Hao, unless they had a Grandmaster of the Dao of alchemy like him.</p><p>By way of analogy, it was as if these Greenwood Wolves had been raised on gold and silver, only to have someone pull out a chunk of copper or iron to try to get their attention. How could they possibly care about something like that&#x2026;?</p><p>That was especially true of Big Hairy, who had eaten a real Demon Nurturing Pill!</p><p>Actually, the pill formula from the Frigid Snow Clan was not flawed. However, they were not capable of using it to create a true Demon Nurturing Pill, because they were not Demon Sealers!</p><p>Only Demon Sealers could use the Demonic Qi of Heaven and Earth, merge it into the medicinal pill, and thus, concoct a real Demon Nurturing Pill.</p><p>That was the type of pill that Big Hairy had consumed. The changes to him had been earth shattering, beyond that which exists in the mortal world.</p><p>&#x201C;If Grandmaster Mo has no other methods to try out, then I think it&#x2019;s time for me to select some of his neo-demons. Earth Priest, could I bother you to bear witness?&#x201D; Meng Hao smiled at Mo Fang, then turned to bow toward the Earth Priest with clasped hands.</p><p>How could Meng Hao not have noticed the man studying the totem tattoo on his right hand earlier? That had been his plan from the very beginning, and also the identity he had chosen to assume.</p><p>A descendant of the Frigid Snow Clan!</p><p>The totem tattoo on Meng Hao&#x2019;s right hand was none other than the Eyeless Larva, which looked very similar to the Frigid Snow Larva. People who didn&#x2019;t know the difference would naturally confuse the two. Of course, Tribes who uses larvae as totems were not very common in the Western Desert, but Meng Hao was sure that, if he showed off the talents of a Dragoneer, people would be able to put two and two together.</p><p>Earlier, this was exactly what had happened in the mind of the Earth Priest.</p><p>The Earth Priest thought for a moment and then looked over at Mo Fang. He didn&#x2019;t need to actually say anything. Not just his gaze, but the gazes of all the surrounding Crow Scout Tribe members all fell onto Mo Fang. It is difficult to get off a tiger once you start riding it, and that is just the situation Mo Fang was in right now.</p><p>He glared over at Meng Hao. As of now, the hostility he felt had reached an incredible level. After a long moment, he ground his teeth. He couldn&#x2019;t possibly violate Dragoneer custom in front of all these people. At the same time that he&#x2019;d had received approval to attempt to take Meng Hao&#x2019;s neo-demons, he had agreed to the possibility of Meng Hao taking his.</p><p>Mo Fang gave a cold harumph as he thought to himself, &#x201C;His neo-demons are just too bizarre. However, even though I have no way to make them follow me, if he thinks he&#x2019;s going to take my neo-demons away, he&#x2019;ll be sadly mistaken!&#x201D; Thinking of the strength of his own neo-demon horde, he felt quite confident. With that, he waved his right hand, causing a special bag of holding to appear. This bag of holding appeared to be constructed from the skin of beasts. It began to tremble, and suddenly multiple beams of light flew out, accompanied by powerful cries.</p><p>In total, there were 23 Greenwood Wolves, 19 Greenwood Snakes and 13 Greenwood Bats. They flew out to surround around him, emanating shocking power. The observing Crow Scout Tribe members all had looks of profound veneration on their faces.</p><p>That caused some of Mo Fang&#x2019;s embarrassment to lessen. His eyes glittered as he produced another bag of holding, which he waved in front of him. Three deafening cries suddenly shook everything as three thirty meter long neo-demons emerged. One was a burly Greenwood Python and another was an Greenwood Wolf whose body crackled with lightning.</p><p>The final of the three caused the entire horde of neo-demons to tremble. It was a gigantic bat!</p><p>This bat emanated an ancient aura, as if it had been alive for a very, very long time. Although it floated there in mid air, its wings were actually folded up, and it stood upright like a person. It glared about, its eyes cold and piercing. Anyone upon whom it gazed wouldn&#x2019;t be able to stop from trembling.</p><p>The surrounding Crow Scout Tribe members couldn&#x2019;t help but stare at Mo Fang with deep veneration.</p><p>&#x201C;Three level 5 neo-demons! All three of them are mutated! And look at that Black Bat&#x2026;. It&#x2019;s as strong as the late Foundation Establishment stage!&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;There are even a lot of level 4s, although most of them are level 3. Not a single one is level 2!&#x201D;</p><p>In the Western Desert, a level 5 Dragoneer could be considered a powerful expert. For example, this Mo Fang actually only had a Cultivation base at the mid Foundation Establishment stage. However, when it came to his fighting prowess, he would be able to cause quite a headache even for someone of the late Foundation Establishment stage.</p><p>&#x201C;This is my neo-demon horde! If you think you have the skill, just try to take them away!&#x201D; Mo Fang&#x2019;s voice echoed about, filled with self-confidence. His expression was one of pride. He was sure that at the very most, Meng Hao would take away some of the weaker level 3 neo-demons. After acquiring these neo-demons, had expended virtually all of his resources to raise them. They had been with him for years, giving him supreme confidence that they would not capitulate to Meng Hao.</p><p>Meng Hao gave a slight smile. Considering his own Cultivation base and identity, he didn&#x2019;t find it inappropriate to teach a lesson to this trifling little Cultivator. His gaze swept across the neo-demons.</p><p>&#x201C;To become one of Meng Hao&#x2019;s neo-demons can only be described as luck and good fortune. I&#x2019;ll give you the space of three breaths to decide. If you want to follow me, come over here.&#x201D; He spoke the words indifferently, but as he did, he caused Demonic Qi to begin to emanate out.</p><p>Even this small amount of Demonic Qi immediately caused a dozen or so of the neo-demons to begin to tremble and look over. It also caused the totemic neo-demons of the Crow Scout Tribe members to begin to howl. The sound of it filled the air as almost all of them left the sides of their masters to fly in the air, howling with hope.</p><p>The face of the Tribe&#x2019;s Grand Elder fell as the totem tattoo on his body began to glow and then the Greenwood Snake within charged out, howling.</p><p>The face of the Earth Priest also fell as his own totem tattoo began to emit a glow. Gasping, he waved his hand, causing the power of his Cultivation base to explode out. Invisible shields suddenly sprang up everywhere, preventing the totemic neo-demons of the Tribe members from charging forward.</p><p>Mo Fang&#x2019;s face was filled with thorough disbelief, and he was breathing rapidly. He stared at the neo-demon horde which had moments ago been obediently standing at his side. Now, they were howling crazily and charging toward Meng Hao. In the blink of an eye, only the three level 5 neo-demons were left behind struggling.</p><p>After the space of one breath passed, the Greenwood Wolf and the black Greenwood Snake shot over toward Meng Hao. Now, only the bat remained, staring fixedly at Meng Hao with its cold eyes. However, within those eyes could be seen both intelligence and shock.</p><p>&#x201C;Come here,&#x201D; said Meng Hao, staring back at the bat. He could tell that the bat was suffering from some hidden injury that others would find it difficult to be able to detect. Meng Hao was also able to sense a faint Demonic Qi emanating out from it.</p><p>The feel of it was very similar to that of Big Hairy.</p><p>However, the Demonic Qi was in disorder, which was why Meng Hao was able to detect the strange injury.</p><p>As soon as Meng Hao spoke to the bat, the gigantic creature&#x2019;s eyes flashed with a glow of intelligence. Suddenly, its body shot into the air and it flew to stand next to Meng Hao.</p><p>&#x201C;Impossible!&#x201D; shouted Mo Fang, blood spraying from his mouth as he staggered backward several paces. He felt like he was on the verge of going insane.</p><p>All of this was simply impossible to accept. His eyes were bright red and his hair was completely disheveled. Even as he roared, his eyes filled with intense killing intent. How could he possibly accept that in front of all these people, some completely unknown Dragoneer would defeat him in this way? Killing intent flared in his eyes and he suddenly lifted up his right hand.</p><p>There on his wrist was a black bone bracelet. The bracelet shattered into pieces, which exploded out into a bone ash mist.</p><p>The bone ash mist then began to congeal. As it did, it started to glow brightly and emit the light of teleportation. Roaring sounds could suddenly be heard within the teleportation spell; at the same time, streams of ash-colored light appeared, which then transformed into a gray Giant Ape, roughly twenty-five meters long.</p><p>The ape&#x2019;s eyes were bright red, and its fur was long and luxuriant. The instant it appeared, it let out a frightening roar, along with an aura equivalent to the Core Formation stage, that filled the area. The faces of the surrounding Crow Scout Tribe members were instantly filled with shock.</p><p>&#x201C;A level 6 neo-demon!!&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;That&#x2019;s a level 6 neo-demon!!&#x201D;</p><p>His voice filled with rage, Mo Fang cried, &#x201C;Kill all his neo-demons, and kill him!!&#x201D;</p><p>Immediately, the Giant Ape rose up and let out a shocking roar. Then, it charged directly toward Meng Hao.</p><p>Its face was filled with ruthlessness, as if there was no living thing that it couldn&#x2019;t rip to shreds.</p><p>Meng Hao&#x2019;s eyes grew cold.</p><p>&#x201C;Big Hairy,&#x201D; he said coolly.</p><p>As soon as the words left his mouth, Big Hairy, who had been napping the entire time, lifted his head. His body looked skinny and weak, but then suddenly exploded with shocking power. His cold eyes filled with brutality and madness that soared to the Heavens.</p><p>His savagery was usually kept suppressed by Meng Hao. Without a direct command, it would never appear. Now, it exploded out, and as it did, a bloody aura swirled out from his body. It was in this moment that his green-colored fur suddenly&#x2026;</p><p>Turned white!</p><p></p>
