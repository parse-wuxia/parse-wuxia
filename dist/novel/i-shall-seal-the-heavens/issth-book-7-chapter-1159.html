<p><strong>Chapter 1159: Forced Backward, Over and Over!</strong></p><p>Before fusing with his third Nirvana Fruit, he could only materialize a head when using the Blood Demon Grand Magic. After everything he had experienced in the Windswept Realm though, his Blood Demon Grand Magic had advanced to an astonishing degree, thanks in large part to the third Nirvana Fruit. As the void ripped open, a full Blood Demon emerged, roaring.</p><p>The hand which stretched out toward Guru Heavencloud sported razor-sharp claws, and radiated boundless blood-colored light. Guru Heavencloud&#x2019;s blood suddenly seemed to be incited to the boiling point, causing his face to flicker as he waved his finger toward the Blood Demon.</p><p>As his finger waved through the air, his forehead split apart, causing a drop of black blood to fly out. It wriggled and twisted as it sped through the air, emitting a shriek like that of a baby as it rapidly grew larger, transforming into a mosquito!</p><p>The mosquito was only the size of a hand, but it radiated a boundless murderous aura as it buzzed through the air toward the Blood Demon.</p><p>One was gigantic, the other was minuscule. However, when they slammed into each other, a huge boom rang out; apparently neither of the two could overcome the other.</p><p>The blood-colored light around the Blood Demon transformed into a sea of blood, but the mosquito was incredibly agile. It dodged to the side, and then stuck its mouthpiece in and started sucking up the blood.</p><p>&#x201C;Interesting,&#x201D; Meng Hao said with a chuckle. He had never seen a beast like this particular mosquito before. He quickly raised his right hand and performed an incantation gesture, then pointed in Guru Heavencloud&#x2019;s direction.</p><p>Numerous Immortal mountains descended, spinning around the area and crushing down toward Guru Heavencloud. Their mere appearance on the scene caused the entire asteroid to begin to tremble.</p><p>If you looked closely, you would be able to see that on the peaks of the Immortal mountains were cross-legged figures, meditating. Those figures looked almost exactly like Meng Hao!</p><p>This was a divine ability manifested because of Meng Hao fusing with the third Nirvana Fruit and reaching the Allheaven Dao Immortal Realm.</p><p>Guru Heavencloud&#x2019;s heart began to pound. The increasing threat posed by Meng Hao caused him to suddenly realize that he had acted a bit presumptuously before. However, he was still fully confident in himself.</p><p>With a cold harrumph, he waved his sleeve, causing a beam of sword light to fly out, within which was a black flying sword that fairly dripped with deadly poison. As it whistled through the air, the black sword split apart into numerous ghost images. Hundreds of beams of sword light shot toward the Immortal mountains, each one of them filled with the astonishing power of Guru Heavencloud&#x2019;s full circle Ancient Realm cultivation base.</p><p>Booms rang out as the sword light closed in on the Immortal mountains. Distortions spread out, and as the Immortal mountains began to collapse, the images of Meng Hao opened their eyes and looked around with cold gazes. They were like clones of Meng Hao, all of whom rose to their feet and flew directly toward the sword light.</p><p>A huge boom rang out through the air.</p><p>&#x201C;I&apos;m very curious to see how many magical items you have tucked away!&#x201D; Meng Hao performed an incantation gesture and pointed out, causing beams of violet light to shoot out into the air and rapidly form into the outline of a moon!</p><p>It was... a violet-colored moon!</p><p>The moon transformed into an illusory shadow which shot toward Guru Heavencloud, rapidly shrinking down until it landed on his forehead and sank down inside. Moments later, the mark of a violet moon began to form in that very spot!</p><p>It was in that moment that the magic of the violet moon exploded out!</p><p>An intense sensation of crisis swept through Guru Heavencloud, causing him to gasp. However, he had no time to consider the situation. Something inside him was telling him that he could under no circumstances allow the violet moon to fully form on his forehead. He immediately fell back, waving his sleeve, causing a white banner to unfurl around him. The banner transformed into numerous Cloud Dragons, which roared viciously as they shot, not toward Meng Hao, but toward Guru Heavencloud&#x2019;s own forehead.</p><p>In the moment before the moon fully formed, nine Cloud Dragons transformed into a protective force that exploded toward the violet moon.</p><p>Massive rumbling sounds could be heard as the nine protective dragons caused the violet moon magic to gradually dissipate.</p><p>A strange gleam appeared in Meng Hao&#x2019;s eyes. This was the first time he had encountered someone who primarily used magical items in battle, with few divine abilities. He took a step forward, making a snatching motion, which caused the previously pitch-black void in the area to suddenly erupt with white beams of light.</p><p>Numerous intense beams flew out of the ground of the asteroid, and shockingly, even the distant sun!</p><p>They rapidly coalesced into a hand-sized image of a sun!</p><p>This was Meng Hao&#x2019;s own divine ability... the Supernova Magic! [1. Meng Hao created the Supernova Magic in <a href="www.wuxiaworld.com">chapter 942</a>]</p><p>He tossed the sun out, sending the blinding globe of light shooting toward Guru Heavencloud. As it neared, it continued to suck in more light, growing larger and larger, until it began to send out shocking ripples that caused Guru Heavencloud&#x2019;s face to fall.</p><p>Meng Hao was actually very curious about this battle style which used so many magical items; it was as equally shocking as his own numerous divine abilities.</p><p>&#x201C;How could he have so many divine abilities and Daoist magics!?&#x201D; he thought, his face falling. &#x201C;Plus, each and every Daoist magic seems completely extraordinary!&#x201D; As of this moment, he no longer dared to underestimate Meng Hao. As the globe of light bore down on him, intense feelings of crisis filled him once again. He suddenly lifted his right foot up into the air and took a step forward. Rumbling filled the air as an enormous Feng Shui compass appeared, spinning through the air and shining with boundless light. Shockingly, numerous ghostly images appeared inside the light, howling viciously as they shot toward the light of the Supernova Magic.</p><p>&#x201C;Lad, I have more magical items than you can even imagine!&#x201D; Guru Heavencloud said, his voice dark and sinister. What he said was true. After all, he owned the entire Heavencloud Bazaar for years, giving him access to extraordinary amounts of cultivation resources and magical items.</p><p>Rumbling filled the air as the light of the Feng Shui compass slammed into Meng Hao&#x2019;s Supernova Magic. A boom echoed out, and a huge tempest exploded between the two of them. The entire asteroid field trembled violently, and the cultivators in the area gasped and retreated at full speed.</p><p>&#x201C;Meng Hao!!&#x201D; roared Guru Heavencloud, waving his left hand to send nine stone statues flying out of his sleeve. Their appearance was completely bizarre; they all looked like old men who, after flying out into the air, opened their eyes and began to shine with brilliant light as they shot murderously toward Meng Hao.</p><p>Guru Heavencloud&#x2019;s eyes flickered, and he smacked his bag of holding. Immediately, a crimson dust appeared, which had apparently been refined from blood. The dust writhed, causing blood to immediately begin to spread out in all directions.</p><p>However, Guru Heavencloud wasn&#x2019;t done. He stepped back, waving his sleeve again to send three violet medicinal pills flying out, which radiated boundless pressure as they flew through the air toward Meng Hao.</p><p>All of this takes some time to describe, but actually, Guru Heavencloud completed all of these numerous actions in the time it takes to blink. All of a sudden, Meng Hao was faced with a raging, murderous aura. The light from all the various magical items interlocked to create a multicolored wave of light.</p><p>&#x201C;You certainly do qualify to run a bazaar like this in the middle of an asteroid,&#x201D; Meng Hao said coolly. &#x201C;And no wonder the other sects and clans don&#x2019;t want to offend you.... You have a lot of magical items. Well, now I&apos;m looking forward to seeing how many Daoist magics you have.&#x201D; He took a step forward, and the starstone in his eye melted. In the blink of an eye, he had transformed into a shooting star!</p><p>One Thought Stellar Transformation!</p><p>He immediately sped through the air, shattering the void, causing strange colors to flash. Booms could be heard as all the magical items which blocked his path were crushed as easily as weeds or twigs!</p><p>It started with the nine statues of the old men, who roared in unison and tried to block Meng Hao in planet-form as he closed in on them. They began to tremble, and cracks spread out across their bodies. In the blink of an eye, they shattered into countless pieces.</p><p>Next was the blood-colored dust which had transformed into a sea of blood. It rumbled toward Meng Hao, sending tendrils of blood out to try to bind him up. However, as soon as the tendrils appeared, cracking sounds could be heard, and they collapsed into pieces.</p><p>They were completely incapable of causing Meng Hao to falter even half a step!</p><p>As for the three medicinal pills, they exploded with electricity, transforming into three violet lightning bolts. However, when they landed on Meng Hao in planet-form, the only effect was that the planet shrank down and eventually vanished, revealing Meng Hao himself, who shone with azure light as he transformed into an azure roc. With a flash, he shot forward, arriving directly in front of Guru Heavencloud!</p><p>The speed with which all of this happened is virtually impossible to describe.</p><p>&#x201C;Have any more magical items?&#x201D; Meng Hao asked, clenching his hand into a fist and unleashing the Life-Extermination Fist.</p><p>A massive boom rang out, and the Heavens trembled. The void shattered, and the Life-Extermination Fist, backed by the power of Meng Hao&#x2019;s cultivation base, instantly caused the sensation of deadly crisis that filled Guru Heavencloud to peak.</p><p>And yet, he didn&#x2019;t retreat. Instead, his eyes began to shine with a bright light.</p><p>&#x201C;So, I underestimated you....&#x201D; he said. Then he exhaled sharply. There was no visible reaction to his exhalation, and yet, the natural laws around him suddenly changed, and the Essences around him gradually formed together into his own personal Daoist magic.</p><p>One Breath Shatters the Heavens!</p><p>RUUUUUUMMMMBLLLLE!</p><p>Meng Hao&#x2019;s Life-Extermination Fist slammed into the breath of air, giving rise to shocking vibrations. Meng Hao&#x2019;s eyes suddenly gleamed with a vicious light as he also declined to retreat. Instead, as the backlash power hit him, he took another step forward.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>He sent the backlash attack spinning backward again, toward Guru Heavencloud, whose face fell as he suddenly fell back.</p><p>Every step that he fell back, Meng Hao took another step forward. One was forced backward over and over, the other advanced step by step!</p><p>So far, Meng Hao had seemed to control the entire battle! He was completely and utterly domineering!</p>
