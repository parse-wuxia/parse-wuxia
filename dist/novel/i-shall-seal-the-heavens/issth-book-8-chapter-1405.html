At the same time, the butterfly exploded out from within the timeshift magic!</p><p>It was as if enormous energy had built up, the eruption of which destroyed the whole area in exchange for a blessing of Time, resulting in an incredible burst of speed.</p><p>Rumbling sounds echoed out as the butterfly shot forward with indescribable speed, speeding across the starry sky to appear... directly above the vortex that Paragon Sea Dream had determined contained hope for the Realm!</p><p>The butterfly was right there over the very center of the vortex, at the source of all its power!</p><p>The power of the vortex caused Meng Hao&#x2019;s Demonic qi to scatter, instantly revealing the butterfly to the tracking magics of the Immortal God Continent and the Devil Realm.</p><p>Because of that sudden surge of energy, the Immortal God Continent and the Devil Realm both began to vibrate, and ghost images popped up around them as teleportation power was unleashed. Then, they vanished.</p><p>Meng Hao&#x2019;s mind trembled as the timeshift magic raged around the butterfly, pushing it inexorably downward toward the wild tempest that was the vortex. When you compared the butterfly to the vortex itself, it was completely miniscule.</p><p>The sight caused Meng Hao&apos;s pupils to constrict. As he stood there on the butterfly&#x2019;s back, he couldn&#x2019;t stop thinking about the words spoken just now by the green-colored entity. However, there was little time to contemplate the matter deeply. Lightning crackled endlessly within the mad tempest of the vortex that drew ever nearer.</p><p>Down below, at the center of the vortex, was what appeared to be a black hole filled with infinite rifts, within each of which was another world.</p><p>At the most inward depths of the black hole... was a green-colored coffin. When added to the black and white color that made up the vortex, that green made the entire thing three colors!</p><p>Although it seemed as though the coffin wasn&#x2019;t very far off, the truth was that after entering the vortex, it was still an incredible, even immeasurable distance away.</p><p>&#x201C;The enemy forces will be here at any moment!&#x201D; Meng Hao thought, eyes flickering. He poured his cultivation base into the butterfly, and as its wings flapped, it headed into the vortex.</p><p>It was in that very moment that, not too far off in the distance, the void rippled, and then a huge rift silently opened up. What came out was not the Immortal God Continent, but instead, a roiling black fog. As the fog spread out, a land mass that was just as large as the Immortal God Continent appeared, emanating a tremendous pressure.</p><p>Leading the land mass were several brightly colored butterflies. As for the continent itself, a huge coffin could be seen there, surrounded by countless cultivators prostrated in worship. Slowly, those cultivators began to look up, to peer out of the land mass... toward Meng Hao and the butterfly!</p><p>&#x201C;The Devil Realm Continent!&#x201D; Meng Hao said, his heart sinking. Before another moment could pass, the void in the other direction ripped open, and the Immortal God Continent appeared.</p><p>Boundless killing intent locked down onto Meng Hao, as well as the butterfly.</p><p>An incredible crisis was developing, for Meng Hao, for the butterfly, and for the living beings of the Mountain and Sea Realm.</p><p>Countless cultivators began to pour off of the Immortal God Continent, and leading them all were the same people who Meng Hao had tangled with before... the four 9-Essences Paragons. &#x201C;This time, you won&#x2019;t get away!&#x201D;</p><p>As that happened, a cold snort echoed out from the Devil Realm Continent as a rugged-looking man appeared, leading a vast, endless group of Devil Realm Continent cultivators.</p><p>There were also three beams of light that shot out, emanating energy that could shake Heaven and Earth. Meng Hao even caught sight of a giant rising up on the land mass, whose aura contained a matchless, domineering air.</p><p>Meng Hao sank further into silence as he saw the seemingly infinite hordes of cultivators. The sight of that coupled with the two vast land masses was a huge weight crushing down onto his heart.</p><p>Meng Hao looked up at the vast army of cultivators, and then spoke out in a loud voice: &#x201C;Why...? What do you people want? You want to stop the Immortal from appearing&#xFF1F; Well, there is no Immortal any more. You want that certain object? Well I have it right here! I&#x2019;ll stay behind. Let the Mountain and Sea Realm cultivators go!&#x201D;</p><p>The one to answer Meng Hao was the cold female Paragon. &#x201C;Who said there&#x2019;s no Immortal? As long as the bloodlines of the Mountain and Sea cultivators remain unsealed, the foundation for the Immortal will always exist!</p><p>&#x201C;As for that object... of course we know that you have it!&#x201D;</p><p>Based on her biting words, it seemed she wasn&#x2019;t interested in any sort of discussion with Meng Hao. Waving her hand, she shot forward at top speed, followed by the three other old men. Even as they closed in, the muscular man from the Devil Realm Continent looked on with flashing eyes. It only took him a moment to put the pieces together regarding what had already occurred, and then he also began to advance on Meng Hao.</p><p>Rumbling sounds echoed out as numerous powerful experts and countless other cultivators charged toward Meng Hao. They were like a tidal wave, backed with destructive power that could destroy anything and everything.</p><p>Meng Hao&#x2019;s face fell and he gritted his teeth. Then, he reached out and shoved the butterfly, imbuing it with power to give it a bit more speed. As it shot toward the black hole in the center of the vortex, Meng Hao unhesitatingly stepped off of its back, hovering there alone to face the incoming forces of both of the two great powers.</p><p>Back on the butterfly, Xu Qing wept, and Ksitigarbha stood there with hands clenched into fists. Fatty cried out in anger, and everyone else was trembling. These were people who had watched Shui Dongliu die, had watched Paragon Sea Dream die, and now, they were watching Meng Hao do the same thing that Shui Dongliu had. He was standing there alone to protect them.</p><p>&#x201C;Stay alive....&#x201D; Meng Hao said. &#x201C;I&apos;m not going to die. And one day, I&#x2019;ll come back for all of you.... My family, my beloved, my clan, my friends, my Mountain and Sea Realm!&#x201D; Roaring, Meng Hao lifted his right hand up and then hit the top of his head. Instantly, the precious treasure that was the Mountain and Sea Realm appeared.</p><p>Rumbling echoed out as the Mountain and Sea Realm Grand Aegis appeared, covering the entire area. Meng Hao&#x2019;s hair whipped about him as his energy rocketed up. Demonic qi swirled around him as he single-handedly began to fight against the enemy.</p><p>It was all to buy time for the butterfly, the butterfly which bore the weight of all the cultivators of the Mountain and Sea Realm into the black hole that Paragon Sea Dream had indicated... was where hope lay.</p><p>&#x201C;DIE!&#x201D; Meng Hao threw his head back and roared. His eyes were bright red, and directly behind him could be seen the enormous image of a Demon, also roaring. In the blink of an eye, Meng Hao slammed into the cold woman from the Immortal God Continent.</p><p>A boom could be heard as blood sprayed out of Meng Hao&#x2019;s mouth. And yet, he lunged out in a headbutt. The cold woman&#x2019;s face fell, and she fell back, yet in that very same moment, Meng Hao&#x2019;s right hand made a grasping motion, and the Battle Weapon appeared. Within was the parrot, silent, and taciturn. Although the parrot hadn&#x2019;t spoken out loud for a long time, there it was in the Battle Weapon, looking almost berserk.</p><p>The meat jelly appeared and transformed into a suit of armor. At the same time, the mastiff roared, becoming a bright red cape. The armor was white, and the Battle Weapon radiated madness. The image of the Demon had bright red eyes, and as Meng Hao hovered there with hair whipping around him, a murderous air swirled around him.</p><p>As he clashed with the hosts from the Immortal God Continent, the Battle Weapon wreaked havoc with every swipe and slash. Then, the rugged, muscular man from the Devil Realm Continent began to walk forward. One step. Two steps. Three steps....</p><p>He took a total of seven steps, and with each step, his energy rose higher and higher. He was like some sort of battle deity, roaring as he closed in on Meng Hao with a fist strike.</p><p>&#x201C;Seven God Steps!&#x201D; he roared.</p><p>Meng Hao spun, clenching his left hand into a fist to unleash the God-Slaying Fist.</p><p>A massive blast surged out in all directions when they met. Blood sprayed out of Meng Hao&#x2019;s mouth, and as for the muscular man, he also retreated, blood oozing out of his mouth. He was just about about to close in for another attack when he realized that Meng Hao had spun around and was attacking the Immortal God Continent forces.</p><p>The man frowned, then gave a cold snort. Next, the forces of the Devil Realm Continent surged forward, joining in with the Immortal God Continent&#x2019;s forces to attack Meng Hao.</p><p>Chaotic battle instantly erupted. Meng Hao left swaths of death wherever he passed. He moved with incredible speed, his aura changing constantly. One moment it would be domineering, the next, brutal. He grabbed an Immortal God cultivator and viciously absorbed him. Now that he had become a Demon, the Blood Demon Grand Magic was even more explosively powerful and efficient.</p><p>The Lightning Cauldron appeared, and he quickly teleported to another location, where a large group of cultivators was pursuing the butterfly. A vicious expression could be seen on Meng Hao&#x2019;s face as he waved his sleeve, causing the cultivators to cough up mouthfuls of blood. Some were even instantly killed and transformed into ash.</p><p>Meng Hao was already soaked in blood, but he was laughing, a laughter filled with madness and a desire for slaughter.</p><p>From the moment the butterfly had begun its true flight into the vortex until now, only a few dozen breaths of time had passed. However, during that time, Meng Hao had single-handedly locked down the entire enemy force, ensuring that the butterfly could draw ever closer to the black hole.</p><p>&#x201C;Are you looking to die!?&#x201D; roared the cold woman from the Immortal God Continent. Her murderous aura swirled, and as she closed in on Meng Hao, she was joined by her three fellow 9-Essences compatriots.</p><p>Meng Hao&#x2019;s eyes flickered with red light. Without any hesitation, he waved his right hand, causing numerous mountains to descend. Essence magic was also unleashed as he fought back.</p><p>At the same time, the three old men advanced, clearly not aiming for Meng Hao, but rather, the butterfly.</p><p>However, even as they attempted to pass by Meng Hao, he laughed loudly, and then waved his right arm with violent force.</p><p>The void trembled, and everything shook. The Paragon Bridge appeared, provoking immediate reactions from the cold woman and her three companions. Mixed emotions could be seen on their faces, but they didn&apos;t pause for even a moment. Meng Hao began to laugh loudly.</p><p>&#x201C;Now, I will wipe out my Paragon Bridge from my Dao for all eternity.... Detonate!&#x201D; Meng Hao&#x2019;s laughter echoed out as the Paragon Bridge trembled. Cracks spread out across its surface, unleashing blinding light. Then, the bridge exploded!</p><p><strong>Chapter 1405: Wiping the Paragon Bridge from the Dao!</strong></p><p></p><hr><p></p>
