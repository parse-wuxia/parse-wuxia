<p><strong>Chapter 1583: None Can Match My Strength!</strong></p><p>As Allheaven&#x2019;s words echoed out, the Devil souls transformed into a deep golden color. It was an ancient, upright color, filled with explosive strength.</p><p>Then came a Heaven-rending Earth-crushing roar as a giant appeared in front of Meng Hao, so large it seemed capable of propping up the Heavens.</p><p>He was tens of thousands of meters tall, and that didn&#x2019;t even seem to be the limit of how big he could be. The collapse of the starry sky seemed to expand, as if this giant could supercede the starry sky itself.</p><p>He roared, causing all of the distant observing cultivators to cough up blood. However shaken they had been before, they were even moreso now.</p><p>This was a battle that not even 9-Essences experts could participate in. They could do little more than watch from a distance. The Sect Leader and the others were completely numb, and as for all of the other living beings from the starry sky of the Vast Expanse, they were retreating at top speed and didn&#x2019;t dare to pause for a moment.</p><p>&#x201C;Meng Hao!&#x201D; the giant roared. As it turned to look at him, it revealed upon its forehead... ten stars!!</p><p>Not nine stars, but ten! [1. <strong>Quasi-spoiler information about Renegade Immortal to follow</strong>. To some extent, nine is the limit of the number of stars that could appear on the forehead of a cultivator in RI. In some ways that is not the case. You will understand what I mean eventually if you read RI. In any case, the point here is that having ten stars appear is unprecedented, and indicates that this cultivator is at an extremely high level of power]</p><p>The ten stars radiated golden light, making this giant seem like a Heavenly God. In fact, it would be correct to say that this was the God of the Heavens!</p><p>This was the fifth transformation, the Heavenly God Transformation!</p><p>Golden light emanated from the giant&#x2019;s eyes, causing everything it looked at to be bathed in gold. Meng Hao&#x2019;s expression flickered as he backed up. Even as he did, everything around him began to melt.</p><p>There was nothing around him except for the starry sky and the void, and yet it all melted, transforming into black liquid that emanated a stench of rot. Then, that liquid formed together into numerous enormous spheres with countless tentacles, almost like gigantic sea urchins.</p><p>&#x201C;None can match my strength!&#x201D; the giant roared, its gaze locking onto Meng Hao as its right hand clenched into a fist and punched out.</p><p>That fist seemed capable of wreaking ultimate destruction. It was like the pinnacle of the starry sky, and as soon as it appeared, it seemed impossible for it to miss its target.</p><p>Meng Hao&#x2019;s eyes gleamed with the desire to fight. His fleshly body had already reached the ultimate peak, Transcendence, so he unleashed his God-Slaying Fist, which slammed into the giant&#x2019;s incoming fist strike.</p><p>The resulting deafening boom sounded like the vague howl of some primordial beast. Meng Hao was shaken. It felt like a wild wind of Time was blasting into him, causing blood to spray out of his mouth as he was thrown backward like a kite with its string cut. However, the giant&#x2019;s fist was also left trembling.</p><p>That didn&#x2019;t stop the giant, though. Roaring, it took a step forward and unleashed another fist strike. Rumbling echoed out as Meng Hao defended. Simultaneously, the giant opened his mouth and let loose a powerful roar.</p><p>That roar shredded the void and destroyed natural laws. It was like a tempest that slammed into Meng Hao, causing blood to spray out of his mouth once more. Yet again, he fell back.</p><p>The power being wielded by this Heavenly God was shocking, and yet, it only caused Meng Hao to want to fight even more.</p><p>&#x201C;Who cares about Heavenly Gods?!&#x201D; he said, waving his sleeve. Then, his right hand flashed with an incantation gesture as he unleashed Demon Sealing Hexing magic.</p><p>In that instant, the Heavenly God giant&#x2019;s eyes shone with bright, flickering light, and the desire to kill. He took a step toward Meng Hao, and his right hand began to move. However, he was doing something different than before.</p><p>Even as his roar continued to echo out, his body suddenly began to wither. It was as if all of his flesh and blood were being sucked into his right arm.</p><p>It was a shocking scene to behold as the Heavenly God giant&#x2019;s entire right arm began to get larger and stronger.</p><p>Soon, it had broken through to a shocking level of power, whereupon it formed a fist that began to rumble toward Meng Hao.</p><p>The level of danger Meng Hao sensed upon that fist was the most intense he had ever felt. He had never felt power like this since Transcending. This was... a peak level power within the starry sky!</p><p>In fact, it even went beyond the natural laws of the starry sky, exceeding all limitations. This was a level of power on par with the Universe itself. This was not just simply the power of Transcendence, it went to a realm beyond that, the Ancestor Realm!</p><p>&#x201C;DIE!&#x201D; bellowed the Heavenly God giant. As its fist bore down, Meng Hao&#x2019;s pupils constricted into tiny dots. If he couldn&#x2019;t somehow handle this fist strike, he would definitely be defeated.</p><p>&#x201C;Fifth Hex. Inside-Outside Hex!&#x201D; Meng Hao&#x2019;s eyes shone brightly as he reached out with his right hand and unleashed the Inside-Outside Hex. A vortex suddenly popped up in front of his extended palm, within which pulsed the powers of both positive and negative.</p><p>Even as the fist closed in, the power of the Inside-Outside Hex pushed back toward it.</p><p>The entire starry sky went still. A power of expulsion appeared from within Meng Hao&#x2019;s palm, the core of which came from Meng Hao&#x2019;s Dao Essence. As it exploded out, the Heavenly God giant&#x2019;s fist slowed down, eventually coming to a stop only a few centimeters in front of his palm.</p><p>Meng Hao&#x2019;s eyes were completely bloodshot. The power of the Inside-Outside Hex spread out, filling the area around him with endless contradictory power.</p><p>A deadlock appeared to have formed. Madness grew within the eyes of the Heavenly God giant, and then suddenly, one of the stars on its forehead began to shatter. As it did, the giant&#x2019;s power began to rocket up.</p><p>Things weren&#x2019;t over yet though. A second star exploded, then a third and a fourth. The explosions continued, and more power built up within the Heavenly God giant&#x2019;s fist, which edged closer and closer to Meng Hao.</p><p>&#x201C;Still not enough!&#x201D; howled the giant. &#x201C;DETONATE!&#x201D; A fifth star exploded, then the sixth, seventh, eighth, ninth, and finally, the tenth. In that moment, indescribably explosive energy surged through the body of the Heavenly God giant.</p><p>The fist, backed by the power of the self-detonation of ten stars, slammed into Meng Hao&#x2019;s palm. Meng Hao&#x2019;s hand shattered, and blood sprayed out of his mouth as he was thrown backward.</p><p>Cracking sounds emanated out as his bones were shattered, and his flesh and blood were shredded. This was the most serious injury he had suffered during the entire fight with Allheaven.</p><p>&#x201C;DIE!&#x201D;</p>
