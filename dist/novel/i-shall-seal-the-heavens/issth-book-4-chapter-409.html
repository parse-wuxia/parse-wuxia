They gathered together in mid-air to observe the Crow Scout Tribe. &#x201C;For a Greenwood Tree totem like that to appear in the Crow Scout Tribe means&#x2026; perhaps someone is forming a totemic Nascent Soul?&#x201D;</p><p>Similar scenes played out in the other Tribes. The Crow Soldier Tribe seemed to be especially affected; five beams of prismatic light shot out toward the Crow Scout Tribe.</p><p>Although these five tribes were all connected by blood, there were certain conflicts between them that were impossible to dispel. As it turned out, the Crow Soldier Tribe hated the Crow Scout Tribe more than any of the other Tribes.</p><p>The five beams of light from the Crow Soldier Tribe whistled through the air as they shot toward the Crow Scout Tribe. As they neared, even before they could be seen clearly, an enormous shield of light suddenly appeared from within the Crow Scout Tribe. It enveloped the entire Tribe, covering it over and blocking the Crow Soldier Tribe.</p><p>The awe-inspiring voice of the Crow Scout Tribe Greatfather rang out: &#x201C;The Crow Scout Tribe is busy at the moment. Other Tribes are prohibited from entering. Any who does&#x2026; will be shown no mercy.&#x201D;</p><p>The Crow Soldier Tribe members outside the shield exchanged glances. There was nothing they could do but laugh coldly; passing through the shield was not an option.</p><p>Meng Hao was aware of everything that was happening on the outside. However, the majority of his energy was being spent on the totem branding and the Greenwood Tree in front of him, which was slowly growing smaller and smaller. Soon it was only three meters tall. Everything was shaking, and up above in the sky, lightning suddenly appeared, dancing back and forth. The life force emanating out caused the vegetation in and around Meng Hao&#x2019;s courtyard to burst out wildly.</p><p>In fact, it was even affecting the vegetation on the mountain, the front district of the Crow Scout Tribe, and the forest that surrounded them all. The plants and vegetation everywhere grew rapidly, which of course caused even more shock on the parts of the other Tribes. Black clouds churned up above, and howling sounds began to echo out within the forests. The surrounding neo-demons could sense the life force and were beginning to feel greedy.</p><p>It was at this moment that suddenly a thunderous roar sounded out that shook Heaven and Earth: &#x201C;Outlander!&#x201D;</p><p>The faces of the Crow Soldier Tribe members suddenly flickered. Without hesitation, they shot backward in retreat, gloating expressions filling their faces.</p><p>On the other side of the shield, the face of the Crow Scout Tribe Greatfather suddenly filled with anxiety. He looked up into the sky at a collection of black clouds that was heading toward them at high speed.</p><p>&#x201C;Dammit, the Outlander Beast was injured by the Crow Divinity half a year ago, but it didn&#x2019;t actually leave. It&#x2019;s been hiding in the area this whole time!! Unless we join forces with the other four Tribes to summon the Crow Divinity ancestor, we can&#x2019;t possibly be a match for the Outlander Beast!</p><p>&#x201C;This Grandmaster Meng&#x2019;s Greenwood Tree totem has reached an incredible level. Could it be that Ancestor Greenwood actually bestowed him with some of its essence?!?!&#x201D;</p><p>The four powerful Crow Scout Tribe experts who hovered there in mid-air were all filled with shock.</p><p>The Grand Elder looked up at the approaching black clouds and said, &#x201C;Greatfather, if the Outlander Beast is here for this vassal surnamed Meng, and we are incapable of fighting back against it, wouldn&#x2019;t it be best to just hand him over and alleviate&#x2026;.&#x201D;</p><p>Before he could finish speaking, the white-haired Greatfather interrupted him with a cold snort.</p><p>&#x201C;Don&#x2019;t mention anything like that ever again. This person was selected by Ancestor Greenwood. If we can&#x2019;t protect him, how could we ever have the face to offer worship to the ancestor? Our Crow Scout Tribe might not be classified as a great Tribe, but we keep our promises. I already said that we would offer protection. Only if we are absolutely certain that we cannot resist it will I renege! Unleash the full power of the mountain protection spell formation!&#x201D;</p><p>The Greatfather flicked his sleeve, causing a beam of green light to shoot out toward the mountain peak. The mountain trembled as a green light rose up to merge with the existing shield. The light rose up higher and higher into the sky, forming the image of a gargantuan tree!</p><p>The Crow Scout Tribe was contained inside of this tree, which would protect it from anything on the outside.</p><p>Meng Hao&#x2019;s face was pale. He had never imagined that branding the Greenwood Tree totem would be so difficult. The Greenwood Tree in front of him was now about three meters tall. However, each time Meng Hao rotated his Cultivation base, it only shrank one inch.</p><p>&#x201C;When it comes to branding totems, the optimal size is one inch&#x2026;.&#x201D; Meng Hao wasn&#x2019;t an expert when it came to totems, but he knew all the fundamentals. His eyes filled with determination. Golden light erupted out from him and he pointed his finger toward the ground, suddenly utilizing Righteous Bestowal. Imperceptible ripples flowed out across the ground as strands of Demonic Qi arose. They merged into Meng Hao, assisting in the branding of the Greenwood Tree.</p><p>Three meters. Two and a half meters&#x2026;. Soon it was only two meters tall. Then one&#x2026;. Meng Hao let out a roar, followed by a mouthful of blood. The blood contained Demonic Qi, and as soon as it splashed onto the Greenwood Tree, the tree trembled and then shrank down to the size of roughly half a meter.</p><p>Meng Hao was panting, and stubborness radiated from his eyes. It was at this exact moment that the Crow Scout Tribe&#x2019;s shield shook under the force of a mighty blow. An enormous roaring sound filled the air. Meng Hao looked up to see a patch of black clouds slamming into the shield.</p><p>A roar sounded out from within the clouds: &#x201C;Outlander!&#x201D;</p><p>Heaven and Earth shook as ripples spread out. Cracking sounds could be heard as the clouds once again slammed into the shield.</p><p>The Greatfather, the High Priests and the Grand Elder all looked shocked. Their bodies shook, and they coughed up blood. They were the ones supporting the shield, and would bear the effect of any blows levelled against it.</p><p>Suddenly, the fearsome pressure of Spirit Severing spread out from within the clouds. This was the terrifying power of the Outlander Beast!</p><p>It takes some time to describe, but the black clouds moved with incredible speed as they struck again. An enormous roaring filled the air. Cracking sounds turned into the rumbling of an explosion as the enormous shield tree formed by the Crow Scout Tribe&#x2019;s defensive spell formation collapsed into pieces. As the spell dispersed, the Greatfather and the others coughed up blood and were sent tumbling backward, their faces unsightly.</p><p>The black cloud patch hovering in mid-air shot directly toward Meng Hao.</p><p>As it shot forward, two glowing, red eyes could be seen within. They were filled with avarice and insanity. As it shot through the air, the black clouds dissipated, revealing the Outlander Beast&#x2019;s luxuriantly furred body.</p><p>It was like a giant ball covered with thick, dense fur that draped off of it. As it shot forward, the fur rippled in the wind, almost like a tail. The whole image made the Outlander Beast look like a long, furry comet.</p><p>At a glance, it was obvious that no one would be able to move to block the thing. The Greatfather and the others could only watch wide-eyed as the Outlander Beast approached. The powerful experts from the other Tribes watched the scene playing out, clearly taking joy in the calamity that was befalling the Crow Scout Tribe.</p><p>Meanwhile, Meng Hao&#x2019;s body was shining with golden light. The Greenwood Tree in front of him was only half a foot tall. Even as the Outlander Beast approached, Meng Hao lifted his finger, congealing the invisible Demonic Qi in the area and then pushing down onto the Greenwood Tree.</p><p>&#x201C;Shrink!&#x201D; he bellowed. The congealed Demonic Qi exploded out with shocking pressure. In the blink of an eye, the Greenwood Tree shrank to the size of an inch. At this point, the Outlander Beast let out a fearsome roar. The Greenwood Tree shot toward Meng Hao&#x2019;s forehead, instantly branding onto him.</p><p>A Wood-type totem! The first of the colors of the five elements, a green tree!</p><p>The instant the branding formed, Meng Hao&#x2019;s Cultivation base began to rotate. It suddenly grew until it was only a hair&#x2019;s breadth from the Nascent Soul stage&#x2026;. His life force abounded to a fearsome extent. In fact, it grew to the point that some of the injuries Meng Hao had sustained in the past from wasting his own life force were now completely recovered. Even more shocking, the incredible level of Meng Hao&#x2019;s life force made it so that no matter how ancient he grew in later years, he would always be able to maintain his current physical appearance.</p><p>Such terrifying life force also made Meng Hao&#x2019;s magical techniques even stronger than they had been before.</p><p>&#x201C;This proves that my choice to tread the path of the five elements is the correct one. This path allows me to use an alternative method to create a Perfect Five-Colored Nascent Soul that belongs&#x2026; solely to Meng Hao!&#x201D;</p><p>Meng Hao turned, lifting his hand. Totemic power flashed as the Eyeless Larva appeared. Layers of silk suddenly began to spin around him, forming a shield roughly three meters large.</p><p>A massive boom shook everything as the Outlander Beast slammed into it. Meng Hao was shoved backward, and blood sprayed from his mouth. He looked up at the Outlander Beast, which hovered in front of him in mid-air, its eyes wide. It appeared shocked that the power of its attack was incapable of shattering the silk shield.</p><p>An ominous glint appeared in its eyes. It could sense two different fluctuations of power on Meng Hao, fluctuations that frightened even it. However, the life force emanating from the Greenwood Tree brand on Meng Hao&#x2019;s forehead contained healing powers that caused greed to emanate up from within its heart.</p><p>Furthermore, the Demonic Qi on Meng Hao&#x2019;s body was driving it crazy. Its eyes began to glow red and it howled as it once more charged toward Meng Hao.</p><p>Meng Hao shot backward. As he did, he took note of the thick, luxuriant fur that covered the Outlander Beast, and suddenly, his eyes flickered.</p><p>Next, he let out an enormous shout which echoed out in all directions, filtering out into the surrounding mountainous forest: &#x201C;Parrot, there&#x2019;s a great furred beast here that you&#x2019;ve definitely never tried out!!!&#x201D;</p><p>Almost as soon as his voice echoed out, a squawk could be heard. This squawk caused the Outlander Beast to suddenly stop in its track. A look of vigilance appeared in its eyes as a multicolored streak shot toward them from off in the distance, moving with blinding speed.</p><p>Within the colorful streak, the parrot&#x2019;s eyes emitted a bright glow, and its body quivered with excitement. A dubious expression covered its face as it looked over the Outlander Beast&#x2019;s luxuriantly furred body. It shivered with anticipation.</p><p>&#x201C;I haven&#x2019;t tried out this before. I really haven&#x2019;t! Ahhhhhhh! Lord Fifth is happy!&#x201D; The parrot seemed on the verge of going crazy. It exploded forward, utilizing all the power it possessed to shoot toward the fearful, vigilant Outlander Beast.</p><p>Meng Hao had a strange expression on his face. A short distance away, he stopped moving as he watched the parrot approaching. Suddenly, he sighed inwardly.</p><p>&#x201C;It seems certain unique indulgences really can release the ultimate potential power. It didn&#x2019;t even notice that the Outlander Beast has a Cultivation base with power similar to Spirit Severing&#x2026;&#x201D;</p><p>-----</p><p><em>This chapter was sponsored by Allan Tam</em></p><p></p>
