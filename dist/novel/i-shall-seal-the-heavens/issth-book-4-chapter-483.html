The former Crow Soldier Tribe Greatfather, who was now the Greatfather of the entire Crow Divinity Tribe, as well as Wu Chen, Wu Ling, and all the other Tribe members who had participated in the bloody war, all let out unbridled roars of fury.</p><p>Killing intent sprang out from their eyes as all the enmity from the past exploded out within them. They shot forward, totems magically materializing. Immediately, booms filled the air.</p><p>Behind them, the rest of the more than ten thousand members of the Crow Divinity Tribe all joined them as they charged into battle.</p><p>The Crow Divinity Tribe members had experienced many battles in their two years of migration. In the beginning, they had been small and weak. Over time, they had grown stronger and more powerful in their rise to prominence. It wasn&#x2019;t just the physical strength of the Crow Divinity Tribe which had grown, but also the strength of their hearts!</p><p>As for the Tribe members who had surrendered to the Crow Divinity Tribe and exercised faith in Meng Hao, his totems not only caused their Cultivation bases to soar up, they also benefited from his medicinal pills. This caused their faith in the Crow Divinity Tribe as a whole to grow strong.</p><p>Most importantly, after joining the Crow Divinity Tribe, they had hope. This was especially so considering that their former Tribes did not exist any more. As of now, the Crow Divinity Tribe was their only hope.</p><p>They looked forward to the day when the Crow Divinity Tribe would enter the Black Lands. After two years of constant victories in battle, their hope was incredibly strong.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, the battle began&#x2026;. The Crow Divinity Tribe did not shrink back in the slightest. Even as the Five Poisons Tribe was still nearing, the more than ten thousand Crow Divinity Tribe Cultivators, joined by 80,000 neo-demons, instantly charged into battle. That was when the slaughter began!</p><p>No words were exchanged. The Five Poisons Tribe and the Crow Divinity Tribe were long-standing enemies. The enmity which existed between the two had been interrupted by the arrival of the violet rain Apocalypse.</p><p>Were it not for that war, the Crow Divinity Tribe would never have sunken into such decline and would already have been able to migrate out of the Western Desert North region. As far as the Five Poisons Tribe went, it was because of the war that the Scorpion Branch split off, and their Sacred Ancients now lacked a spider and a scorpion!</p><p>Of the Five Poisons, two were gone. To the Five Poisons Tribe, this was a catastrophic blow. At any other time, it wouldn&#x2019;t have been too much of a problem. With time, they could have recovered. But at that critical juncture, the violet rain arrived, forcing the Five Poisons Tribe to migrate. Their overall level of power was reduced, causing further complications for their migration.</p><p>This was why the desire to destroy the Crow Divinity Tribe was so strong in the hearts of the Five Poisons Tribe.</p><p>Shocking booms filled the air. Heavy casualties were immediately inflicted in the initial fighting. There were even members of Crow Divinity Tribe who chose to self-detonate, causing the Five Poisons Tribe to recall the frenzied fighting from years ago.</p><p>However, the Five Poisons Tribe also fought with madness. The war years ago had been one of invasion; this battle, however, was one in which they were fighting for their own survival as a Tribe. Even some Five Poisons Tribe Cultivators began to self-detonate.</p><p>The Crow Divinity Tribe only had seven Nascent Soul Cultivators, whereas the Five Poisons Tribe had more than ten Priests. However, the Crow Divinity Tribe&#x2019;s advantage was not in the number of Cultivators they possessed, but rather, their neo-demons.</p><p>They had powerful neo-demons. 80,000 of them. There were even high-level neo-demons in the horde who could compare to Nascent Soul Cultivators. As of this moment, the two Tribes were relatively evenly matched.</p><p>The Crow Divinity Tribe Greatfather faced off against the Five Poisons Tribe High Priest. Their battling shook Heaven and Earth. The Greatfather was actually not a match in terms of his Cultivation base. However, he had long since chosen to burn his Cultivation base and life force, all of himself, to temporarily increase his level of power. Only by doing so could he hold his own against the High Priest.</p><p>In truth, what he was trying to do was hold up the High Priest and prevent him from attacking anyone else.</p><p>As for the Five Poisons Tribe&#x2019;s totemic Sacred Ancients, they were missing a spider and a scorpion. However, their viper, toad, and centipede still emanated explosive pressure.</p><p>Before the Apocalypse, their presence would have been astonishing. However&#x2026; because of the years of violet rain, as well as the totemic sealing of the Crow Divinity Tribe years ago, they were much weaker than before.</p><p>Right now, their level of power exceeded that of the Nascent Soul stage, and they were incredibly powerful. The ones to match up against them were the Outlander Beast, the parrot, and the meat jelly. As the battle began, it became apparent that, whether it be it in terms of their top fighters, or even the ordinary Tribe members, the Crow Divinity Tribe was slightly at a disadvantage. Although it couldn&apos;t be said that they were being crushed, it was quite close to that. Thankfully, Meng Hao&#x2019;s 80,000 neo-demons were there, allowing them to just barely hold on.</p><p>However, it was clear that they would only be able to hold on for a short period of time!</p><p>In the middle of the battlefield was a bizarre area that no one could enter. It was an empty area roughly three hundred meters across.</p><p>In the very middle of the three hundred meter area was an enormous, rippling sphere of blood. Roaring sounds could be heard emanating out from it, as if someone inside were struggling, trying to break out.</p><p>This blood sphere was formed by none other than the Ji Clan blood. Because of the power of the Agarwood, it had changed forms in this way. Instead of recklessly trying to kill Meng Hao, it was now acting like a seal, trapping him inside.</p><p>&#x201C;Kill them!&#x201D; roared the Crow Divinity Tribe members.</p><p>&#x201C;Press on! The Sacred Ancient will definitely break out!&#x201D; To the Crow Divinity Tribe members, Meng Hao was their Sacred Ancient, almost like a god.</p><p>With Meng Hao there, all dangers and all catastrophes could be overcome!</p><p>They had staunch faith in Meng Hao. They truly believed that all they had to do was endure; their Sacred Ancient would break free from the blood sphere. Once he appeared, he would lead them into victory over the Five Poisons Tribe!</p><p>The Five Poisons Tribe Greatfather&#x2019;s eyes glittered. His Cultivation base was at the late Nascent Soul stage. With a cold snort, he charged into the battle. Wherever he went, death followed. Any Crow Divinity Tribe member who tried to block his way exploded into death.</p><p>His body turned into a beam of light as he shot directly toward the three hundred meter wide area. No one could stop him. As he neared, he flashed an incantation with both hands, sending an attack to roar toward the blood sphere.</p><p>This was a special technique, a divine ability which could actually pass inside of the blood sphere. He wanted to kill Meng Hao and acquire the Demon Spirit!</p><p>Moments ago....</p><p>Roaring echoed out. Within the blood-colored sphere, Meng Hao&#x2019;s face was grim. He looked around him at the rippling, bloody light that surrounded him like a wall. It was like a gigantic seal, with him locked in the middle, unable to emerge.</p><p>Meng Hao&#x2019;s hands flickered as one magical technique and divine ability after another slammed into the blood-colored wall. The sound of it all was deafening, but the blood-colored wall wasn&#x2019;t harmed in the slightest.</p><p>He also had no way to know what was happening outside. Just before being sealed inside, he saw the Five Poisons Tribe approaching. It was in that moment that he knew that this battle&#x2026; was a disaster for the Crow Divinity Tribe!</p><p>Meng Hao was worried and anxious. It wouldn&#x2019;t matter if he was stuck inside this place for a short period of time. But if too much time passed, he knew that the Crow Divinity Tribe would not be able to hold out against the Five Poisons Tribe.</p><p>The Five Poisons Tribe had obviously planned things out well. Their goal was obvious; eradicate the Crow Divinity Tribe and snatch their Demon Spirit. You could say that in the past two years of battle, they had never faced a situation as dangerous as this.</p><p>Even as Meng Hao was frowning in thought, the blood-colored wall suddenly contracted, and then moments later, expanded outward. During this period of contraction and then expansion, three strands suddenly bored through the wall. As soon as they entered, they transformed into a gigantic viper, centipede and toad. Three of the five poisons magically appeared. Instantly, they let out piercing cries and shot toward Meng Hao.</p><p>On the bodies of each of these three creatures, Meng Hao could see the image of an old man.</p><p>That old man was none other than the Five Poisons Tribe Greatfather, who was outside of the blood-colored seal.</p><p>Meng Hao&#x2019;s eyes glittered as he waved his hand. Instantly, his Cultivation base exploded out with the power of four of the five elements. A ferocious, gale-force wind swept across the three poisons. The viper instantly broke apart and disappeared.</p><p>Meng Hao let out a cold snort. Cracking sounds could be heard from within his body as he moved forward like a fiend. A fist descended, and the toad let out a miserable shriek as it exploded into pieces.</p><p>At the same time, the centipede&#x2019;s body twisted as it shot like lightning toward Meng Hao. Meng Hao&#x2019;s eyes flickered as he spit out a mouthful of Alcohol Qi.</p><p>The Alcohol Qi was like a mist that instantly enveloped the centipede. Its body began to wither, and it let out a shriek. It was at this point that a mark like a black moon appeared on Meng Hao&#x2019;s forehead.</p><p>Employing the evil magic, the moon flickered as it branded down onto the body of the centipede, using it as a conduit with which to attack the Five Poisons Tribe Greatfather to whom it was currently connected. The black moon Spiritual Sense attack bubbled forth rapidly.</p><p>Moments ago, the Five Poisons Tribe Greatfather was outside of the blood-colored seal, flashing an incantation with both hands, his expression vicious and filled with killing intent. However, his face suddenly flickered as the viper was killed!</p><p>Without thinking about it, he backed up a bit. Before he could barely move a single pace, his expression suddenly filled with shock. That was the moment that Meng Hao&#x2019;s fist slammed into the toad, causing it to explode.</p><p>Then, his eyes suddenly widened.</p><p>&#x201C;Not good!&#x201D; Without hesitating, he made to retreat. His hand moved as he prepared to sever his magical connection to the centipede. Before he could complete his action, the image of a black moon suddenly appeared on his forehead.</p><p>The instant the seal appeared on his forehead, violent, explosive pain like lightning filled the Five Poison Tribe Greatfather. It felt like an invisible blade were stabbing into his Sea of Perception. Blood sprayed from his mouth, and he tumbled backward, face filled with astonishment. He instantly severed the connection between himself and the centipede.</p><p>After the connection was severed, the Greatfather coughed up another mouthful of blood. His face was pale and filled with intense shock.</p><p>&#x201C;His Cultivation base is so powerful!&#x201D; he thought, panting. It was at this point that intense ferocity emanated from within his eyes.</p><p>&#x201C;It&#x2019;s a good thing that in my planning I told the Heavenly Blood to seal him if it couldn&#x2019;t kill him. If he weren&#x2019;t sealed right now, then we would have to pay a heavy price to win this battle!</p><p>&#x201C;He must absolutely not be allowed out of that seal! The Demon Spirit is most likely on his person; therefore, we must keep him sealed while we slaughter the Crow Divinity Tribe. Afterward, we will use all of the power of the Tribe to destroy him, body and soul!&#x201D; A vicious smile twisted the lips of the Five Poisons Tribe Greatfather. He no longer made any attempts to attack through the blood-colored seal. Instead, he began to add further seals on top of the original seal, determined to keep Meng Hao thoroughly trapped inside.</p><p>-----</p><p>This chapter was sponsored by Rune M&#xF8;ller and Omar Hamad</p><p></p>
