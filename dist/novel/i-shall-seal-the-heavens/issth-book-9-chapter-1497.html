 <p><strong>Chapter 1497: Borrowing Power for the Search!</strong></p><p>The Icemountain Giant&#x2019;s pupils constricted; as of this moment, he could sense how powerful Meng Hao&#x2019;s aura was, and knew that he was absolutely no match. However, he was still sure that Meng Hao wouldn&#x2019;t be able to kill him. He took a step forward, and struck out with his fist.</p><p>The Flamephoenix erupted with power, transforming back into her avian form. A sea of flames erupted around her as she shot toward Meng Hao. In the blink of an eye, intense booms echoed out as the three of them began to fight.</p><p>The ground quaked. The world shook. Meng Hao performed an incantation gesture with his right hand, and the pitch-black head behind him howled and shot toward the giant and the phoenix.</p><p>The Icemountain Giant&#x2019;s body vibrated, cracks spreading out across his surface before he completely exploded. However, in almost the same instant, he formed back together, and seemed no less willing to fight.</p><p>The Flamephoenix also fell back, her eyes shining brightly as countless flaming magical symbols appeared around her.</p><p>&#x201C;Too weak,&#x201D; Meng Hao said coolly as he hovered there in midair. &#x201C;Time to use your trump cards. If I win, you must tell me the location of the mirror shard. If you win, then I&#x2019;ll leave immediately.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Very well,&#x201D; said the Icemountain Giant. &#x201C;The outcome of this battle will determine everything.&#x201D;</p><p>The Icemountain Giant didn&apos;t seem surprised at all about what was happening. Meng Hao wasn&#x2019;t sure exactly how he and the Flamephoenix were communicating, but that didn&#x2019;t matter. The giant roared, beating at his chest with his fists. As a result, countless chunks of ice fell off of him, which then formed together into an enormous greataxe.</p><p>The Flamephoenix flickered as more flaming magical symbols appeared, and her body grew in size until it was 30,000 meters long. Intense, terrifying heat radiated out from her, causing the surrounding icy landscape to melt. And yet, only a moment later, it froze back up again.</p><p>Meng Hao&#x2019;s eyes flickered, and his mouth twisted into a cold smile as he stepped forward and unleashed a fist strike. It was none other than the Devil-Butchering Fist!</p><p>That fist strike contained the Life-Extermination Fist, the Self-Immolation Fist, and the God-Slaying Fist. All of those fist strikes became the Devil-Butchering Fist. The sky dimmed, as if this fist were replacing everything above and below as it rocketed toward the Flamephoenix.</p><p>The giant howled, hefting the greataxe and then slashing it down toward Meng Hao&#x2019;s fist. The giant simultaneously performed an incantation gesture with his left hand, causing intense coldness to spring out, creating an all-freezing windstorm that swept over Meng Hao.</p><p>The Flamephoenix let out a long cry, and the flames around her emitted Essence aura as they transformed into a crimson claw.</p><p>It was a bird-like claw, bright red, that shot directly toward Meng Hao.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, the giant and the Flamephoenix met Meng Hao&#x2019;s Devil-Butchering Fist. When they slammed into each other, the sky shattered, and the lands were destroyed. The entire world shook violently, and Meng Hao fell backward seven or eight paces. As he looked on, the giant&#x2019;s axe transformed into ash, and the giant himself shattered. A moment later, though, he formed back together, although he seemed a bit smaller than before.</p><p>As for the Flamephoenix, blood sprayed out of her mouth, and she was trembling visibly. Her injuries were serious, but only a moment later, the flames around her roared back to life.</p><p>The fear in their eyes as they looked at Meng Hao was clear. And yet, there was also an uncompromising gleam. Clearly, they would not agree to Meng Hao&#x2019;s demand, and just hand over their precious treasure. Not unless there was absolutely no other choice.</p><p>However, it was at this point that Meng Hao suddenly vanished. When he reappeared, he was right in front of the giant, whereupon he waved his finger.</p><p>Rumbling sounds echoed out as the giant fell back, icy coldness exploding off of him. Even as he prepared to fight back, Hexing magic Essence suddenly erupted out onto from Meng Hao&#x2019;s finger, after which he unleashed another punch.</p><p>The giant roared as cracking sounds emanated out. In the blink of an eye, he recovered, but he was still sent tumbling backward by 3,000 meters. Meng Hao instantly followed up, and at the same time, the Flamephoenix closed in.</p><p>Before the Flamephoenix could even get close, Meng Hao began to spin, his left foot sweeping through the air to create a powerful cyclone that slammed into the giant.</p><p>The giant howled, trembling as he fell back yet again. His body collapsed, but instantly recovered. At the same time, coldness exploded out of him as if to consume Meng Hao. Meng Hao snorted coldly, opening his fist up into a palm, wherein appeared a sealing mark.</p><p>He shoved his hand out in front of him, unleashing the Inside Outside Hex. A force of expulsion appeared, shoving the coldness away. Simultaneously, Meng Hao unleashed another fist strike.</p><p>The blow landed directly onto the giant&apos;s chest. Cracks spread out, and the giant exploded into fragments of ice. Meng Hao subsequently waved his sleeve, causing a wind to spring up and scatter the fragments.</p><p>Those fragments seemed capable of piercing through any barrier, and they quickly began to form back together. However, Meng Hao&#x2019;s eyes flashed with red light, and he performed an incantation gesture, then waved his finger, unleashing the Eighth Hex&#x2019;s Essence of space. His target was the Flamephoenix, who was closing in behind him.</p><p>The power of space erupted out, and the Flamephoenix&apos;s eyes widened. She let out a piercing shriek, and flames erupted off of her as she summoned a huge flame giant to take her place within the sealing power.</p><p>However, even as the Flamephoenix used a substitute to escape the Spatial Sealing, Meng Hao arrived and unleashed a fist strike. Flames burst out, but she quickly recovered, but Meng Hao then continued to unleash one fist strike after another.</p><p>He struck a total of thirteen blows. Each time, the Flamephoenix would collapse into flames, but then reform. After every blow, her face was a bit paler, and she was trembling even harder. When the final blow landed, she was sent flying backward 3,000 meters, blood spraying out of her mouth.</p><p>Just as Meng Hao was about to give chase, a furious roar echoed out.</p><p>&#x201C;Foreigner, you&#x2019;ve forced our hand. It&#x2019;s time for you to die!&#x201D; It was the reformed giant, who spread his arms wide and howled, &#x201C;Ice-Plains Flower!&#x201D;</p><p>As he howled, intense coldness rose up from the ice plains around him. The coldness rushed toward the giant, and at the same time, the layers of ice in the area vanished, to reappear atop his body. It only took a moment for all of the cold and ice to form together into a huge flower on his right hand!</p><p>It was a flower made of ice, resplendent and beautiful, and as it grew larger, a terrifying aura emanated out from it. The entire world shuddered, and suddenly seemed to grow completely devoid of sound.</p><p>Next, the Flamephoenix, which Meng Hao had shoved 3,000 meters away, wiped the blood from her mouth and glared at him with a powerful murderous aura raging out. Eyes flickering with killing intent, the sea of flames around her roared even more powerfully than before, transforming into a pillar of fire that shot up into the sky.</p><p>The sky turned bright red, like a sea of fire, and at the same time, the Flamephoenix cried, &#x201C;Crimson-Flame Flower!&#x201D;</p><p>Almost immediately, the crimson sea of flames began to form together into a gigantic flower. The seemingly everlasting flame stretched from the sky to the land, filling half the world with matchlessly intense heat.</p><p>At the same time, the ice flower emanated intense coldness which froze everything it touched.</p><p>Meng Hao watched all of this happening with an expectant gleam in his eyes.</p><p>At the same time, the giant and the phoenix said, &#x201C;Combined attack!&#x201D;</p><p>The giant&apos;s body shattered, swirling up to merge into the ice flower, which radiated even more resplendent light than before.</p><p>The Flamephoenix likewise merged into the flame flower, ensuring that both of the flowers were the peak existences in this entire world.</p><p>The two flowers then shot toward Meng Hao.</p><p>Meng Hao threw his head back and laughed uproariously.</p><p>&#x201C;I&apos;ve been waiting for this trump card of yours!&#x201D; As soon as the words left his mouth, his energy skyrocketed. His hair rose up, and his black armor flashed as he performed an incantation gesture with his right hand. The Essence of the Eighth Hex appeared, then the Seventh, and the Sixth... all the way to the Essence of the First Hex. Then, they began to merge together.</p><p>&#x201C;Eight Hexes, combine!&#x201D; He threw his arms out in either direction, as the eight Hexing magic Essences transformed into threads, which then became a huge net.</p><p>The net spread out in all directions, and in the moment that it made contact with the ice and flame flowers, the world shattered. Heaven and Earth distorted as a huge shockwave blasted out in all directions. Within the blast, Meng Hao coughed up a mouthful of blood, and his body was shredded into a mass of bloody flesh.</p><p>And yet, his eyes shone brightly. This was the moment he had been waiting for!</p><p>&#x201C;Copper Mirror Armor, Shake the Heavens!&#x201D; The armor on his body suddenly flew off him, transforming back into seven shards. Then, they merged together, forming the almost-complete shape of a mirror!</p><p>This was the second true function of the copper mirror!</p><p>Almost as soon as that mirror appeared, the terrifying blast created by the ice and flame flowers, and the eight combined Hexes, was deflected by the mirror, changing it from an outward blast... into... a focused attack aimed at the ground!</p><p>Within the ice and flame flowers, the faces of the giant and the phoenix both fell. However, there was no time for them to do anything in response. Meng Hao&#x2019;s cultivation base power exploded out like a sharp blade, joining the blast as it slammed into the ground.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, the terrifying peak power of all three of these powerful experts slammed into the layers of ice below.</p><p>BOOOOOOOOOMMM!</p><p>The lands quaked in response. Meng Hao couldn&#x2019;t single-handedly break open the ground, but the combined power of all three of them caused the plains around them to collapse. An enormous crater opened up, to reveal... a sprawling necropolis!</p><p>Underneath this world of ice and fire, there was a necropolis that stretched out in all directions.</p><p>In the moment that the necropolis appeared, the aura of the eighth mirror shard erupted with unprecedented intensity. Meng Hao laughed heartily as he flew down toward the necropolis.</p><p></p><hr><p></p>
