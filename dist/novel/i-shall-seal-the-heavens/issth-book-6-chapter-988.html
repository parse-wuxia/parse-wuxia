<p><strong>Chapter 988: Wanna Get Married, Wifey?!</strong></p><p>Fang Xiufeng wore a strange expression as he stood there on Planet South Heaven, looking at Meng Hao&#x2019;s A Writ of Karma. He also noticed Meng Hao&#x2019;s expression, and couldn&#x2019;t help but sigh emotionally.</p><p>Off to the side, Meng Li was chuckling. When she saw the look on Fang Xiufeng&#x2019;s face, she knew exactly what he was thinking.</p><p>&quot;This kid was a charmer from the moment he was born,&quot; she said, laughing.</p><p>&#x201C;Charmer?&#x201D; said Fang Xiufeng, gaping. He hesitated for a moment. &#x201C;He&#x2019;s your son. Right before he left, he did say that he wanted all of the Chosen in the Ninth Mountain and Sea to owe him money&#x2026;.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;When Hao&#x2019;er was born, I always knew that he would set different aspirations than everyone else. As for me, I was hoping that his grand ambition would be to get all of the pretty girls in the Ninth Mountain and Sea to become his beloved concubines.&#x201D; Meng Li smiled, and from her expression it could be seen how much she loved spoiling Meng Hao.</p><p>Fang Xiufeng stood there silently, shaking his head and smiling wryly. Only he knew that deep within his heart, there was something he felt somewhat indignant about, and that was the &#x201C;Foster Father&#x201D; Meng Hao had mentioned when Ke Jiusi gave him the Immortal meridian.</p><p>As Meng Hao&#x2019;s real father, the feelings that had been on display at that moment had caused a sour feeling to rise up in his heart. He couldn&#x2019;t quite accept the situation.</p><p>&#x201C;You still haven&#x2019;t told me why you sent Hao&#x2019;er to Planet East Victory. I know it&#x2019;s not just for those two Nirvana Fruits. I&apos;ve asked you many times, and you never tell me, but this time, I want an answer!&#x201D; Meng Li turned and gave Fang Xiufeng a serious look.</p><p>Fang Xiufeng looked quietly at his wife for a moment before finally saying, &#x201C;You&#x2019;ll know soon enough.&#x201D;</p><p>Currently, the Ninth Mountain and Sea was completely silent, and everyone was staring at Meng Hao. Meng Hao, who had single-handedly defeated all of these Chosen of the various sects and clans of the Ninth Mountain and Sea.</p><p>Some had even joined forces, and yet, had still been defeated. Many of the observers were left completely shaken.</p><p>As Meng Hao hovered there in the starry sky, he looked around at the more than ten true Immortal Chosen, who were staring at him wrathfully. Unfortunately for them, there was nothing they could do. It was at this point that another teleportation portal suddenly blazed into existence in front of Meng Hao.</p><p>Zhao Yifan suddenly walked out of the teleportation portal, accompanied by a massive pillar of sword qi which billowed up from him. The stars trembled as mighty rumbling echoed out in all directions. The true Immortal Chosen in the area instantly stared over at him.</p><p>The cultivators of the Ninth Mountain and Sea were all watching as Zhao Yifan made his appearance.</p><p>&#x201C;Meng Hao,&#x201D; he said. &#x201C;Or should I say... Fang Mu! Long time no see!&#x201D; As ever, he wore a long, cyan robe, which rippled as he walked, and had a sword strapped to his back. At the moment, the energy that emanated off of him far, far exceeded that which he had displayed at the three Great Daoist Societies&#x2019; trial by fire. It was like the difference between Heaven and Earth.</p><p>Zhao Yifan of the Sublime Flow Sword Grotto!</p><p>Meng Hao had fought him twice before. The first time was on Planet South Heaven, when the two had been separated by quite a distance, and had exchanged a single sword attack in midair.</p><p>The second time was during the Three Great Daoist Societies&#x2019; trial by fire. They had vied for first place, a battle in which Meng Hao had been forced to draw on all his battle prowess, and had even allowed a hidden Devilish will to send his heart and mind into chaos, all to be able to only injure Zhao Yifan!</p><p>Now, the two of them stared at each other, scenes from the past playing out in their mind&#x2019;s eyes.</p><p>&#x201C;Zhao Yifan....&#x201D; Meng Hao said slowly. Suddenly, the desire to fight rose up in his eyes. No further words needed to be spoken. There was no enmity between them, only... the need to do battle for the sake of their own Daos in this new era.</p><p>The surrounding true Immortal Chosen quickly grew silent and backed up. They had all been defeated, and would not attack again. Furthermore, they knew how powerful Zhao Yifan was, so their eyes flickered as they prepared for the battle which was about to take place.</p><p>The observing cultivators out in the Ninth Mountain and Sea were recalling the things which had happened in the past between Meng Hao and Zhao Yifan.</p><p>&#x201C;A battle between those two deserves to be the center of attention!&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Back in the trial by fire, Zhao Yifan suffered a huge defeat. But now... he&#x2019;s become a true Immortal. Now that he&#x2019;s making another appearance, I wonder... if he&#x2019;ll get defeated again?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Going up against someone as inhuman as Meng Hao... Zhao Yifan will definitely suffer defeat!&#x201D; As everyone discussed the matter, Meng Hao and Zhao Yifan faced off with proverbial swords drawn. Just when they were about to explode into action, a second teleportation portal suddenly appeared, then, immediately afterward, a third. Bright light filled the starry sky as Fan Dong&#x2019;er walked out, the female corpse behind her, hair draped over its body. The incredible aura of a powerful expert instantly erupted out of Fan Dong&#x2019;er.</p><p>&#x201C;Meng Hao!&#x201D; she said calmly, her alluring voice so icy that everything turned as cold as winter.</p><p>The corpse behind her had long black hair, and emanated the aura of death, causing anyone who looked at it to tremble.</p><p>&#x201C;Eee?! Hello, Inky! I&#x2019;ve missed you!&#x201D; Meng Hao said, eyes shining brightly. After a moment, he continued, a bit embarrassedly, &#x201C;And as for you, little sis Dong&apos;er, it&#x2019;s time you paid my money back!&#x201D; His words caused Fan Dong&#x2019;er&#x2019;s face to immediately darken. She didn&#x2019;t know why, but the instant she saw Meng Hao face to face, and heard his voice, and especially upon seeing the expression on his face&#x2026; her Dao heart filled with an almost uncontrollable urge to give him several vicious kicks.</p><p>Even as she gritted her teeth, the third teleportation portal opened up behind her, and Li Ling&#x2019;er slowly stepped out. She wore a long red gown, and her eyes blazed like lightning as she stared at Meng Hao. Her expression actually seemed a bit torn.</p><p>Meng Hao blinked, then smiled and said, &#x201C;Heyo! Ling&#x2019;er! Wifey! You&#x2019;re here too? Did you want to get married or something?&#x201D;</p><p>When the observers in the Ninth Mountain and Sea heard his words, their eyes went wide. It was as if their ears had been struck by lightning.</p><p>&#x201C;What did he just call Li Ling&#x2019;er?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Dammit! He dared to call Li Li Ling&#x2019;er wifey?!?!&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Now that I think about it, this Fang Hao.... Years ago, the Fang Clan and the Li Clan were supposed to have made a marriage alliance....&#x201D;</p><p>As the audience in the Ninth Mountain and Sea went into an uproar, Li Ling&#x2019;er stared at Meng Hao and then suddenly smiled. In that moment, the complex look in her eye faded away. She was inherently beautiful, and when she smiled, she instantly radiated a bewitching charm.</p><p>&#x201C;Husband,&#x201D; she said, smiling a beautiful smile, &#x201C;you&apos;ve gotten yourself involved with far too many beauties. Once you sever ties with them, then we can get married.&#x201D;</p><p>Meng Hao&#x2019;s eyes went wide. He had never imagined that Li Ling&#x2019;er would accept his statement. When he saw the grin on her face, it made him feel that the there was something suspicious about the whole situation. He laughed it off awkwardly, then his gaze turned cold as he turned to look at Zhao Yifan.</p><p>As soon as his gaze fell upon Zhao Yifan, Zhao Yifan&#x2019;s sword qi erupted, and he took a step forward, reaching his hand out, within which appeared an illusory, azure-colored sword. As his fingers closed around the hilt of the sword, he did not speak. Instead, his body bent like a drawn bow, and then he suddenly slashed the sword out toward Meng Hao.</p><p>The sword caused everything to vibrate; the Heavens dimmed, and more than ninety Sword Dragons appeared within the sword light. They rapidly merged together to form a gigantic Azure Dragon, which roared as it slashed at the void with its claws. Its long whiskers floated in the air as it charged Meng Hao. Everywhere it went, the void shattered and was rent asunder, as if this Azure Dragon could destroy any and all obstacles that got in its way.</p><p>As the Azure Dragon closed in on Meng Hao, he raised his right hand and pointed out. Instantly, massive rumbling sounds could be heard as the Azure Dragon roared to a halt, and was incapable of moving forward even a centimeter.</p><p>&#x201C;Shatter,&#x201D; Meng Hao said coolly. A boom could be heard as the Azure Dragon collapsed, transforming into countless glittering sparks that rapidly dissipated.</p><p>The scene that was playing out instantly caused quite a few people to recall what had happened in the Three Great Daoist Societies&#x2019; trial by fire. What was happening now was somewhat similar, except that back then, Meng Hao had used a palm, and now he was using the casual wave of a single finger.</p><p>Zhao Yifan&#x2019;s eyes glittered brightly as he reached out with his right hand, causing what appeared to be an ordinary sword to appear. It was none other than... his Cloud Sealing Sword!</p><p>He took five quick steps forward, and with each step, his energy soared higher and grew stronger!</p><p>&#x201C;First Sword, Felling the Mortal!</p><p>&#x201C;Second Sword, Shocking the Spirit!</p><p>&#x201C;Third Sword, Severing the Immortal!</p><p>&#x201C;Fourth Sword, Shattering the Ancient!</p><p>&#x201C;Fifth Sword, Trampling the Heavens!&#x201D; With every step, his energy surged, and he would slash out with his sword. Five steps, five Heaven-shaking sword attacks. The starry sky seemed to be on the verge of collapse. Cracking sounds could be heard as a huge fissure appeared, from within which appeared a gigantic claw that lashed out toward Meng Hao.</p><p>The claw looked like the five-taloned claw of a Sword Dragon, formed from five swords. As soon as it appeared, the Heavens trembled, and the expression of all onlookers instantly flickered. The audience in the Ninth Mountain and Sea gasped.</p><p>The desire to do battle gleamed even brighter in Meng Hao&#x2019;s eyes. His expression was cold as his own energy surged, and the power of 123 Immortal meridians erupted!</p><p>He had seen these same sword forms the last time he had fought Zhao Yifan, but this time, they were far, far more powerful! Furthermore, at the moment, Meng Hao wanted nothing more than to see exactly how strong he was.</p><p>He took a step forward and raised his hand. He didn&apos;t use any sort of divine ability, just one punch, which rocketed toward the incoming five-taloned claw!</p><p>123 Immortal meridians erupted, combining with the power of his fleshly body to form an astonishing aura that instantly slammed into the five-taloned claws.</p><p>Massive roaring filled the air, and everything shook. The claw shook for a moment and then shattered into countless pieces. Meng Hao continued to advance, his hair whipping about, his aura surging.</p><p>&#x201C;Zhao Yifan, it&#x2019;s time to use your most powerful secret magic. Otherwise... you&#x2019;re just no match for me!&#x201D; Meng Hao&#x2019;s voice echoed out, and the domineering tone rose with each step he took. Zhao Yifan suddenly felt an intense pressure and urgency weighing down on him. Fan Dong&#x2019;er&#x2019;s face flickered, and Li Ling&#x2019;er&apos;s pupils constricted.</p><p>Zhao Yifan threw his head back and roared, then performed an incantation gesture with his right hand.</p><p>&#x201C;Five Cleaving Swords, Rising Sword Form!&#x201D; He waved his right hand, causing his Immortal meridians to rotate at full power. His more than 90 Immortal meridians now erupted with the battle prowess of more than 110 meridians.</p><p>&#x201C;First Cleaving, Swords Cleave the Heavens!&#x201D; Instantly, tens of thousands of flying swords filled the starry sky above Zhao Yifan. Under the shadow of all those swords, Zhao Yifan looked like a Paragon among swords, shocking to the extreme. Now, the power of more than 120 Immortal meridians exploded out within him!</p><p>&#x201C;Second Cleaving, Immortal: Why Sever the Mundane World?!&#x201D; Zhao Yifan&#x2019;s aura exploded up. In their previous battle, he had been forced to destroy his Dharma Idol in order to fuel the second cleaving. This time, he unleashed the form without the slightest hitch. Furthermore, using this power caused his energy to surge to something similar to more than 130 Immortal meridians!</p><p>This was a true display of the Sublime Flow Sword Grotto&#x2019;s Five Cleaving Swords. It was also the Sublime Flow Sword Grotto&apos;s secret magic for the Immortal Realm. It was actually powerful enough to create a number of illusory meridians which could surpass the normal limit of 123 meridians. However, the Immortal souls that could be formed from those meridians were still limited to one soul per 10 meridians. Furthermore, because of the constraint of 33 Heavens, the maximum number of meridians possible, including those granted by secret magics, was 330, which was considered the great circle.</p><p>Throughout countless years, no one had ever been able to achieve that!</p><p>Meng Hao raised his head, and his eyes shone with brilliant light, like a cold, sharp sword.</p>
