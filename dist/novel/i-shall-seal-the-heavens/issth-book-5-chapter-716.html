<p><strong>Chapter 716: Overbearing!</strong></p><p>&#x201C;You want to leave?&#x201D; said Meng Hao, killing intent radiating out of his eyes. The instant he laid eyes on the cultivators from the Black Sieve Sect, that desire to kill had become insuppressible! Nor did he want to suppress it!</p><p>He wanted catharsis! He wanted&#x2026; to kill!</p><p>Others could leave, but as for the cultivators from the Black Sieve Sect, well, if he hadn&#x2019;t seen them, it wouldn&#x2019;t matter. But now that he had&#x2026; they had to die!</p><p>They absolutely, positively had to die!</p><p>Even as the words left his mouth, Meng Hao was moving forward at an incredible speed. He shot toward the Third Severing Patriarch, whose face instantly fell. Of course, he had long since prepared himself, and immediately shot backward in retreat.</p><p>&#x201C;Meng Hao, you can have our Dao Lake, we&#x2019;re leaving this place!!&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Not happening!&#x201D; was Meng Hao&#x2019;s cold reply. It was with incredible speed that he shot forward to appear directly in front of the Patriarch. He waved his hand, giving rise to an intense rumbling sound that caused everyone in the area to begin to pant and look over.</p><p>That was especially true of the Spirit Severing Patriarchs, whose eyes glittered. They assumed that this was going to be a fierce battle, like a fight between a dragon and a tiger. However, even as the thought occurred to them&#x2026;.</p><p>Meng Hao lifted up his hand and made a gesture toward the Black Sieve Sect&#x2019;s Third Severing Patriarch. Instantly, an enormous blood-colored vortex appeared around him. At the same time, a gigantic blood-colored hand magically appeared, which grabbed down onto him mercilessly.</p><p>RUMBLE!</p><p>&#x201C;NO!!&#x201D; shrieked the old man from the Black Sieve Sect. He went all-out as he tried to struggle free, but was completely incapable. His fleshly body withered away with incredible speed as his qi and blood was absorbed by Meng Hao.</p><p>The sight of it caused the onlookers to gasp with shock. Amazed exclamations could be heard from all directions.</p><p>&#x201C;Blood Demon Grand Magic!&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;That&#x2019;s the true magic of the Blood Demon Sect, the Blood Demon Grand Magic!&#x201D;</p><p>Sir Jian from the Solitary Sword Sect stared at what was happening, his expression one of unprecedented seriousness. His eyes shone with an intense, bright light, and he was breathing heavily.</p><p>The 19th Li Clan Patriarch&#x2019;s pupils constricted, and his heart skipped a beat.</p><p>In the Song Clan was a cultivator who appeared to be an ordinary old man. Suddenly, he lifted his head up, and his eyes shone with a bizarre glow.</p><p>In the Violet Fate Sect, Reverend Withered-Dao&#x2019;s face was covered with a strange expression. He looked at Meng Hao and let out a long sigh in his heart.</p><p>All of this takes some time to describe, but actually happened in the space of only a few breaths. The Black Sieve Sect Patriarch&#x2019;s miserable screams rang out in all directions. However, he was a decisive individual. He saw his body withering rapidly, and realized that he couldn&#x2019;t break free. When the decisive moment arrived, he gritted his teeth and chose to self-detonate.</p><p>His fleshly body exploded, causing the power of qi and blood to surge out; Meng Hao&#x2019;s Blood Demon Grand Magic trembled. At the same time, the Black Sieve Sect Patriarch&#x2019;s Nascent Divinity shot out at top speed from within the blood-colored vortex.</p><p>&#x201C;Damn you, Meng Hao!&#x201D; howled the Nascent Divinity. &#x201C;I should have tortured that slut Xu Qing even more when I had the chance!&#x201D; He shot through the air toward a rip that had just appeared, and was about to enter it, when&#x2026;.</p><p>When Meng Hao heard the old man&#x2019;s words, his killing intent skyrocketed to the pinnacle. He lifted his right hand and then pushed it out in front of him.</p><p>In response, the Black White Pearls and the Ninth Mountain appeared in mid-air. They were almost like Meng Hao&#x2019;s hands, smashing down onto the fleeing Nascent Divinity.</p><p>BOOOMMMMMM!!</p><p>The ground quaked and the air vibrated. The Ninth Mountain crushed down, drowning out the miserable scream that rang out. When the mountain vanished, the Black Sieve Sect Patriarch&#x2019;s Nascent Divinity was in fragments; he was completely and utterly dead.</p><p>The entire process lasted only for about ten breaths of time. To Meng Hao, slaughtering a Third Severing expert was like turning over his hand. The sight caused all onlookers to be thrown into deathly silence.</p><p>Of course, the Blood Demon Sect members were all quite excited, and looked at Meng Hao with more fanaticism than ever.</p><p>&#x201C;Fall back!&#x201D; said Sir Jian. The words echoed in the hearts of the Solitary Sword Sect cultivators as they returned to their places in the three Dao Lakes.</p><p>The Golden Frost Sect cultivators also retreated without the slightest bit of hesitation, as did the Li Clan members. All returned to their various Dao Lakes, keeping a vigilant eye on Meng Hao the entire time.</p><p>&#x201C;Do not leave any Black Sieve Sect cultivators alive,&#x201D; said Meng Hao calmly. Immediately, the several dozen remaining Blood Demon Sect disciples shot toward the Black Sieve Sect cultivators next to the Dao Lake.</p><p>This was not Meng Hao engaged in random killing. No, these Black Sieve Sect disciples had all been part of the spell formation used to dissolve Xu Qing. Sad and shrill screams filled the air for about ten breaths worth of time as the Black Sieve Sect&#x2019;s force was completely slaughtered. Although everyone in the vicinity saw what was happening, no one tried to interfere.</p><p>There were also quite a few 300-meter Dao Lakes in the area surrounding the 3,000-meter Dao Lakes. Meng Hao immediately flew toward one of them and waved his hand, causing a blood-colored flag to stab into the dirt next to the lake.</p><p>&#x201C;This lake is mine!&#x201D; he declared.</p><p>The blood-colored flag was of course the standard of the Blood Demon Sect, and its surface was embroidered with the character &#x2018;Meng &#x5B5F;.&#x2019; This was actually Meng Hao&#x2019;s Blood Prince standard, of which quite a few had been specially crafted by the disciples of the Blood Demon Sect during the past year.</p><p>A standard like this was an item that, as Blood Prince, he had to possess as a token of his authority.</p><p>When he stabbed the flag into the ground, and his voice echoed out, the faces of the people in the area flickered, especially those of the cultivators who were standing guard next to that particular lake.</p><p>Meng Hao approached another nearby lake, then waved his hand to send another flag flying down.</p><p>&#x201C;This lake is mine.</p><p>&#x201C;This lake is mine, too!</p><p>&#x201C;And this one!</p><p>&#x201C;This one also!&#x201D; Meng Hao flashed back and forth. Shockingly, in the blink of an eye, more than half of the 300-meter Dao Lakes were marked with Meng Hao&#x2019;s Blood Prince standard.</p><p>It took only a moment for blood-colored flags to fill the area. Meng Hao was like a surging flood, domineering to the extreme.</p><p>It didn&#x2019;t matter which sect or clan the Dao Lakes originally belonged to, as long as the people guarding a particular lake weren&#x2019;t from the Violet Fate Sect, Meng Hao would occupy it.</p><p>The other sects and clans were shaken by Meng Hao&#x2019;s slaughter of the Black Sieve Sect disciples, and didn&#x2019;t dare to do anything to stop him. He whistled through the air, much to the excitement of the Blood Demon Sect disciples, who flew after him to occupy the various lakes.</p><p>As for the cultivators who were originally occupying those lakes, they unhesitatingly retreated one by one.</p><p>While Meng Hao was in the middle of seizing one Dao Lake after another, there was suddenly a minor eruption. Not many items emerged from the Dao Lakes, especially in the center zone that Meng Hao was in. However, there was one 300-meter Dao Lake up ahead of him that did spit something out.</p><p>In this case, it wasn&#x2019;t a Dao Shadow, nor a magical item, but rather&#x2026; a violet-colored humanoid beast. It was completely ferocious in appearance, with bat-like wings and a horn sticking out of its forehead. As it shot out of the Dao Lake, it transformed into a violet beam of blinding light.</p><p>It roared as it shot forward to try to break through the shield that surrounded the lake.</p><p>Immediately, excited cries rang out.</p><p>&#x201C;It&#x2019;s a beast! A violet beast!!&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;That&#x2019;s a violet beast! Its body is like a treasure! You can refine countless items from it! Violet beasts like that are virtually extinct!!&#x201D;</p><p>Some people were so shocked they were speechless.</p><p>The instant the beast appeared, the cultivators guarding the lake shot forward toward it. Before they could get near, a boom echoed out. The beast roared, its sound transforming into ripples that surged toward the cultivators.</p><p>The cultivators retreated, but Meng Hao moved forward. He slapped his hand down, causing the image of a gigantic hand to appear, which then shot toward the violet beast.</p><p>The violet beast let out a shrill cry and was about to fight back when the huge hand smashed onto it. Its body began to crumble, and then it was smashed into the surface of the lake, a mess of flesh and bones. Meng Hao quickly collected it up.</p><p>&#x201C;This lake is also mine,&#x201D; he said calmly, throwing down a flag.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, Meng Hao had occupied nearly seventy percent of the 300-meter Dao Lakes. When he finally finished, everyone watched with complex expressions as he returned to the area with the 3,000 meter Dao Lakes.</p><p>Along with other Blood Demon Sect members, he occupied the Dao Lake formerly held by the Black Sieve Sect. After that, the Blood Demon Sect members explained everything that had happened before, including the matter of the Violet Fate Sect offering them a Dao Lake.</p><p>After hearing the explanation, Meng Hao looked over toward the Violet Fate Sect. There were many people looking back at him, and their gazes met.</p><p>Meng Hao saw Chu Yuyan and Hanxue Shan. He saw An Zaihai, Lin Hailong, and Ye Feimu, as well as that other old man.</p><p>&#x201C;Bai Yunlai&#x2026;.&#x201D; he thought, instantly recognizing the man who had been a fellow apprentice alchemist with him when he joined the Violet Fate Sect.</p><p>In his former days, Bai Yunlai had been known as the young man who knew everything about the East Pill Division. Now, he was an old man in his declining years.</p><p>Meng Hao avoided Chu Yuyan&#x2019;s gaze. In his heart, there was only Xu Qing.</p><p>Chu Yuyan seemed to be able to sense his state of mind, and a tremor ran through her. She lowered her head.</p><p>Meng Hao sighed inwardly, then glanced over at Fatty and Chen Fan. Finally, he closed his eyes for a moment. When they opened, his pupils were once again as cold as ice.</p><p>He turned his gaze to the Li Clan, then began to walk over to them. Blood Demon Sect cultivators followed him excitedly.</p><p>The 19th Li Clan Patriarch&#x2019;s face flickered. Four other old men from the Li Clan walked out to stand with him, as if they were about to face a mortal enemy. The other members of the Li Clan nervously produced magical items.</p><p>&#x201C;Meng Hao, what are you doing?!&#x201D; bellowed the 19th Li Clan Patriarch.</p><p>&#x201C;Screw off!&#x201D; replied Meng Hao. It was a single command, but it rang out like claps of thunder. Everyone in the Li Clan who was under the Spirit Severing stage coughed up blood. As for the 19th Li Clan Patriarch and the other four Spirit Severing Patriarchs, their faces went pale, and two of them even staggered backward.</p><p>&#x201C;You&#x2019;re going too far!&#x201D; cried the 19th Li Clan Patriarch. &#x201C;Fellow Daoists Sir Jian and Han Yun, don&#x2019;t tell me you&#x2019;re just going to ignore this matter?!&#x201D; Clearly, the 19th Li Clan Patriarch was terrified of Meng Hao because of the slaughter that had just occurred with the Black Sieve Sect.</p><p>&#x201C;SCREW OFF!&#x201D; repeated Meng Hao, his eyes flashing with murderous intent. Again, it was only a single command, but it caused Heaven and Earth to tremble. With the exception of the 19th Patriarch, all the Spirit Severing Patriarchs coughed up blood. As for the ordinary cultivators, some couldn&#x2019;t endure, and their bodies exploded.</p><p>-----</p><p><em>This chapter was sponsored by Jusaz</em></p>
