The Tribe happened to have a gigantic magical item capable of flight. It was a colossal, extremely life-like viper.</p><p>It was roughly three thousand meters long and emanated pressure in all directions. This flying magical item was actually the transmogrified corpse of a Sacred Ancient which had perished many years in the past. The Five Poisons Tribe paid an exorbitant price to the great Heaven&#x2019;s Work Tribe to use their skill to transform the corpse into the flying magical item.</p><p>Normally speaking, its capacity was several thousand people. However, in their fervor to slaughter the Crow Divinity Tribes, the Five Poisons Tribe spared no amount of Spirit Stones, and even ignored any possible damage it might cause, to overload it with more than 30,000 Cultivators. They, along with the Greatfather and nine Priests, immediately headed in the direction they knew Meng Hao to be.</p><p>Among their number was Zhixiang. After returning from the Realm of the Bridge Ruins, she had maintained a low profile and concealed her Cultivation base. No one had picked up on anything out of the ordinary. At the moment, she stood there, eyes glittering, her brow slightly furrowed.</p><p>&#x201C;I never imagined that this Five Poisons Tribe would have a drop of blood of the Ji Clan. The Blood Qi is viscous; it seems to be from a powerful expert of the Ji Clan from ancient times. It has grown weak over the years, to the point where the power of the bloodline won&#x2019;t even spread out. That must be why the Ji Clan is unaware that some of their ancestral blood is on the loose.</p><p>&#x201C;Even still, it is still Immortal blood&#x2026;. Well, it still won&#x2019;t be sufficient to kill Meng Hao.&#x201D; Eyes flickering, she maintained her silence.</p><p>The giant viper flew through the air for a few days. Eventually, it reached a lake, which it quickly crossed.</p><p>The Five Poisons Tribe Greatfather sat there cross-legged atop the giant viper. &#x201C;I can sense that the Heavenly Blood is already nearing its target,&#x201D; he said. &#x201C;It will go in for the kill tonight! Since the Crow Divinity Tribes&#x2019; Grand Dragoneer will die, we must make top speed and arrive in less than a day!&#x201D; With that, he closed his eyes.</p><p>That night, the sky was dark and there was no moon. Everything was pitch black. The Crow Divinity Tribes were resting, having erected simple tents which were organized in concentric rings.</p><p>Regarding the miscellaneous affairs of the Tribe, the Greatfather of the Crow Soldier Tribe had recently been elected to serve as the Crow Divinity Tribe Greatfather. Various rituals were performed which the other Nascent Soul Cultivators also attended. During the past two years, the Crow Divinity Tribe had become a well-oiled machine.</p><p>At the moment, Meng Hao sat cross-legged in his own tent, which was located in the very center of the encampment, an indication of the venerated position he occupied. Outside of the tent, Crow Divinity Tribe Cultivators stood guard day and night.</p><p>Currently, his eyes were closed, and he held an alcohol flagon in his right hand. Throughout the two years, he had kept Han Shan&#x2019;s flagon close at hand. Inside was an unending supply of alcohol. Although drinking it did not give him any Dancing Sword Qi, it left him with a warm feeling inside that kept him quite comfortable despite the violet rain.</p><p>He couldn&#x2019;t drink too much, though. At the most, he would drink three small mouthfuls per day.</p><p>He sat there cross-legged, his eyes closed. His attention was currently focused inside the blood-colored mask, on Ji Nineteen, who was still bound by the flag of three streamers. Whenever he had time these past years, Meng Hao would take the time to study him. The four deadly wooden swords were kept stabbed into him the entire time. Despite Ji Nineteen&#x2019;s raving and cursing, his Cultivation base was incapable of restoring itself. It was completely restricted by Meng Hao&#x2019;s wooden swords.</p><p>Next to Ji Nineteen was the Li Clan Patriarch, who sat there rubbing his hands together excitedly. His body was covered with crackling lightning that danced back and forth. After experiencing the Heavenly Tribulation those years ago, he was almost completely transformed into a Soul of Lightning.</p><p>In compliance with Meng Hao&#x2019;s requirements, he had turned into a sort of jailer, responsible for keeping an eye on Ji Nineteen. Every time Meng Hao came to torment Ji Nineteen, the Li Clan Patriarch would get extremely excited. He would even offer bits of advice to Meng Hao to help him transform Ji Nineteen into a Soul of Lightning.</p><p>As far as Ji Nineteen was concerned, all of that was not the worst of the situation. The worst was that during the two years, the meat jelly had taken a strong interest in him. Every few days it would come in and try to convert him. Ji Nineteen was on the verge of collapse. Every time the meat jelly came to try to convert him, the Li Clan Patriarch would get even more excited, and his face would be covered with a sinister smile.</p><p>&#x201C;Tell me, how does one use the Karma of the Ji Clan? If you tell me, I&#x2019;ll keep the meat jelly away for an entire month. What do you say?&#x201D; Meng Hao spoke slowly and methodically, but all he got in return from Ji Nineteen was raving and cursing.</p><p>Meng Hao&#x2019;s face began to grow colder. His Cultivation base was not weak like it had been all those years ago. He had already reached the point that he was strong enough to kill this weakened Ji Nineteen. Right now, his eyes flickered with coldness for a moment before turning calm again. He was just about to go call for the meat jelly when suddenly, his body completely disappeared. Simultaneously, back in the tent, a fissure suddenly opened up in the air in front of seated Meng Hao.</p><p>As soon as the fissure opened, a blood-colored hand stretched out from within, completely silent and undetectable by anyone. This hand was very strange looking; it had no prints on the fingers or palm, and in the very center of the palm, tens of thousands of magical faces could be seen. This bizarre hand immediately shot toward Meng Hao, extending its finger to in an attempt to tap him on the forehead.</p><p>When the blood-colored hand was only about seven inches away from Meng Hao&#x2019;s forehead, his eyes snapped open. A profound sense of deadly crisis filled him, wrapping up his mind. He instantly moved backward, but the blood-colored finger followed at the same speed. As it did, a blood-colored arm and then a body emerged from the fissure.</p><p>As Meng Hao retreated, he hit the wall of the tent. His eyes flickered as Metal-, Wood-, Water-, and Earth-type totems magically appeared in front of him, slamming into the blood-colored finger.</p><p>A boom rang out, shaking everything and echoing out into the silent night. The tent instantly exploded into bits as Meng Hao shot out from within. The more than 10,000 shocked members of the Crow Divinity Tribe all began to emerge from their tents. When they looked over, they saw their Sacred Ancient, Meng Hao, shooting through the air in retreat.</p><p>Pursuing him was a blood-colored figure which emanated a bloody glow. Its finger was only seven inches away from Meng Hao, blocked by four great totems, which prevented it from moving any closer.</p><p>Meng Hao&#x2019;s face flickered as he retreated. The blood-colored mask instantly appeared; when he donned the mask, a bloody glow shot out of Meng Hao to rise up into the air. A gigantic face appeared which shot toward the blood-colored figure.</p><p>A rumbling boom could be heard as the blood-colored figure pierced directly through the face. Now, it was not seven inches away from Meng Hao, but five.</p><p>&#x201C;What is this thing!?&#x201D; thought Meng Hao, his pupils constricting. At this crucial moment, an azure glow suddenly appeared in his eyes. He opened his mouth, causing an azure Immortal&#x2019;s Sword to fly out. It shot like lightning to slam into the blood-colored figure.</p><p>A boom could be heard as the speeding sword slashed into the figure. Suddenly a sound could be heard that resembled tens of thousands voices all screaming at the same time. The blood-colored figure instantly exploded into countless fragments. Meng Hao saw tens of thousands of magical faces twisting and shattering.</p><p>As the boom echoed out, the Crow Divinity Tribe members down below looked up with anxious expressions. When they saw the blood-colored figure finally collapse, they heaved sighs of relief.</p><p>Meng Hao floated there, his expression grim.</p><p>&#x201C;That thing showed up far too unexpectedly. So strange. It wanted to kill me, which would then cause the Cultivation bases of the entire Crow Divinity Tribe to fall&#x2026;</p><p>&#x201C;Ah?! Wait, something else must be going on. No matter what Tribe it is that wanted me dead, they would not pass up an opportunity to attack after my death. They would definitely follow up in attack! That means the Crow Divinity Tribe is still in danger!&#x201D; Having reached this conclusion, Meng Hao&#x2019;s face flickered. He looked off into the night sky and was just about to summon his neo-demon horde when the grave danger he had predicted appeared. His eyes narrowed as his body transformed into a black moon, which then shot forward in a wisp of green smoke.</p><p>Right behind him in mid-air, countless dots of blood suddenly began to form back together into a blood-colored figure.The bloody glow was a bit weaker this time, but the feeling Meng Hao got was that it was purer. The sense of deadly crisis he felt was even stronger now!</p><p>The blood-colored flickered as it suddenly shrank down into a single, dark drop of blood. The drop of blood instantly caused Meng Hao to begin to breathe heavily.</p><p>&#x201C;Soul Blood! That&#x2019;s a drop of Soul Blood!!&#x201D;</p><p>The Soul Blood turned into a streaking line as it shot toward Meng Hao with indescribable speed. As it did, an incredible, overwhelming aura emanated out. At the same time, the feeling of Karma could also be sensed within the blood.</p><p>It was in this instant that inside the blood-colored mask, the flag of three streamers suddenly began to tremble. It emanated a feeling of hope, and an aura that suggested it had suddenly encountered its archenemy!</p><p>As for Ji Nineteen, a roaring filled his body, and his face filled with disbelief.</p><p>&#x201C;Ancestral aura? It&#x2019;s ancient, extremely ancient, maybe even more ancient than the Ji Clan itself&#x2026;. This is impossible. What generation does this patriarchal blood come from? Whose blood is it?!?!&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Ji Clan blood!&#x201D; thought Meng Hao. His eyes went wide as he realized that all his divine abilities, all his magical techniques, and all his totems were useless against this blood. Even using the green smoke escape art, he wasn&#x2019;t fast enough to evade it. In the blink of an eye, it was upon him.</p><p>Meng Hao didn&#x2019;t even have time to use the Dancing Sword Qi.</p><p>The only thing he had time to do, in the moment just before the blood reached him, was wave his hand. Immediately 80,000 neo-demons emerged. Upon Meng Hao&#x2019;s order, they shot down to protect the Crow Divinity Tribe.</p><p>He just had time to accomplish this. Then, the blood hit his forehead, filling him with roaring pain.</p><p>It was at this time that Meng Hao roared: &#x201C;Agarwood!&#x201D;</p><p>Instantly the power of the Agarwood exploded out from within Meng Hao, fighting back against the power of the blood drop. It was unclear exactly what was happening, but the blood was incapable of killing Meng Hao. After hitting him, the boundless might of the Agarwood expanded out, enveloping Meng Hao.</p><p>It was in this exact moment that the Five Poison Tribe&#x2019;s gigantic viper could be seen up in the sky, whistling through the air. Tens of thousands of Five Poisons Tribe Cultivators transformed into beams of colorful light that shot down toward the ground.</p><p>They were joined by tens of thousands of neo-demons which were under the control of a handful of Five Poisons Tribe Dragoneers. In addition, powerful Nascent Soul Cultivators teleported down, filled with determination to eradicate the Crow Divinity Tribe.</p><p>Off in the distance, the air rippled as the Five Poisons Tribes totemic Sacred Ancients, with the exception of the spider and scorpion, appeared.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, the one thousand Crow Divinity Conclave Tribe members recognized who these people were. The Five Poisons Tribe. Instantly, their eyes turned red.</p><p>When you face up against your archenemy, you won&apos;t rest until they are dead!</p><p></p>
