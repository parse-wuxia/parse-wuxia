 <p><strong>Chapter 806: The Wind Stirs in the Ninth Mountain and Sea!</strong></p><p>Twenty days earlier on Planet South Heaven, Meng Hao&#x2019;s father had slashed out with his sword, causing sword qi to descend on the Eastern Lands. It had pierced into a mountain range, to a dilapidated old temple, whereupon the illusory images of a Daoist rite temple had appeared. The whole thing had been unsealed by Meng Hao&#x2019;s father.</p><p>When such a thing happened, it was only the beginning. The invisible ripples that spread out were very difficult to conceal, and in fact made their way from Planet South Heaven out into the starry sky, whereupon many almighty figures sensed them.</p><p>On Planet East Victory, about half of the entire planet belonged to the Fang Clan. Actually, if the Fang Clan wished it, they could easily take control of the entire planet.</p><p>When the invisible ripples spread out from the Immortal Ancient Daoist Rite Temple on Planet South Heaven, an ancient voice floated out from inside of an archaic temple on Planet East Victory.</p><p>&#x201C;So, another Immortal Ancient Daoist Rite Temple has been unsealed&#x2026; and in the lands of South Heaven&#x2026;. Have the Array Chosen of the clan go to acquire good fortune&#x2026;. Fang Xiangshan. Fang Yunyi. Fang Donghan. You three have a predestined connection to go seek your fortunes there. Your clan uncle Fang Xiufeng is there on South Heaven, so he might be able to provide you with some assistance.</p><p>&#x201C;As for the other clan disciples, although you might not have the destiny, if you wish to go&#x2026; you may.&#x201D; The voice echoed out throughout the entire planet, and in response, incredible energy surged up from three specific locations. One such location was a lake, on the surface of which was a solitary boat. Sitting cross-legged in the boat was a woman wearing white garments, who seemed graceful in an otherworldly way. Her long, lustrous hair fell like a cape down her back, and she seemed ethereal, beyond that which was mortal. On either side of her were two indistinct figures, guards who were there to protect her at all times.</p><p>The woman&#x2019;s eyelashes fluttered as her eyes opened.</p><p>&#x201C;If this is your order, Patriarch, then Xiang&#x2019;er will definitely make the trip.&#x201D;</p><p>In another location was a wild stretch of mountains that was constantly filled by roars of wild beasts so shocking they seemed capable of ripping the sky apart. This place was actually referred to as a restricted area, and was incredibly dangerous. Standing there in the mountains was a young, bare-chested young man currently locked in deadly combat with a gigantic ape that glowed with glittering, golden light. The ape roared, and shockingly, a Dharma Idol appeared. However, the vicious young man still managed to rip the ape in half, showering himself with copious amounts of blood.</p><p>&#x201C;Immortal Ancient Daoist Rite Temple?&#x201D; said the young man. &#x201C;That means that an Immortal Ancient Daoist Medallion will certainly appear! Fang Wei is out training and won&#x2019;t be back any time soon. This good fortune will certainly fall to me, Fang Donghan!&#x201D; The young man drank a huge mouthful of ape blood then rose to his feet. Two beautiful woman materialized, not with physical bodies, but with spirit bodies. Any worldly-wise person would know at a single glance that these were Wind Spirit bodies, something that only members of the Wind Spirit people could possess. Few members of their people existed like this; only a handful would be born in any given generation that were suitable to cultivate this type of Wind magic.</p><p>The two women picked up a cloak, which they draped over the young man.</p><p>The third location was an enormous basin filled with countless chunks of broken stone. These were no ordinary stones; each and every one came from outside in the starry sky, and had fallen to this place as meteors.</p><p>As a result, the basin was filled with incredible pressure, and any cultivator inside would find it hard to even take just a few steps. When inside, it felt as if one&#x2019;s entire body were bound tightly, and if you managed to force yourself to be able to walk, your body might explode.</p><p>Currently, a young man could be seen sitting cross-legged in the depths of the basin. He had no hair, and wore golden clothing. Cracking sounds could be heard ringing out from inside of him; his fleshly body was powerful to the extreme. In fact, he could rely on that power alone to resist the shocking pressure that surrounded him.</p><p>After a few moments passed, he opened his eyes. Within each of his eyes was the image of what appeared to be a planet, bizarre and strange.</p><p>&#x201C;Interesting. An Immortal Ancient Dao Medallion&#x2026;. If I could acquire that and give it to Goddess Zhixiang, it would probably improve her impression of me.&#x201D; The bald young man smiled and rose to his feet. He walked out of the basin, where he was met by two old men who stood guard at his side.</p><p>In addition to these three people, there were more than ten others from Planet East Victory who chose to compete for this particular opportunity.</p><p>Meanwhile, a slender young man stood in the middle of a desert on Planet West Felicity. He wore a green robe which swayed in the wind, and the sword strapped to his back emanated a monstrous sword aura that caused the desert around him to seem like a lake of swords. The music of a Dao floated in the air, and the entire area seemed like a Holy Land. As he stood there, he appeared to be respectuflly listening to someone. After a moment, a brilliant glow appeared in his eyes.</p><p>&#x201C;Immortal Ancient Daoist Rite Temple&#x2026;. I have the strange feeling that if I don&#x2019;t go, I&#x2019;ll regret it. In that case&#x2026; I&#x2019;ll just have to go check it out.&#x201D; He smiled faintly, then transformed into a sword beam that shot off into the distance.</p><p>In another location on Planet West Felicity, a veiled woman sat cross-legged on a mountain peak. Demonic qi swirled about, causing wind and thunder to roll through the air. The woman&#x2019;s eyes were closed, and her aura seemed Demonic, and yet not; Immortal, and yet not.</p><p>&#x201C;Immortal Ancient Daoist Rite Temple,&#x201D; she murmured softly, her voice mesmerizing and charming. &#x201C;The Southern Domain&#x2026;.&#x201D; She smiled as she seemed to visualize the image of a young man.</p><p>&#x201C;Ah, why not go and see some old friends?&#x201D; she said. &#x201C;I wonder if that little punk succeeded in Spirit Severing.&#x201D;</p><p>At the same time, on Planet North Reed, a shocking scene was playing out.</p><p>The Li Clan of the Southern Domain had merely been a collateral branch. The real Li Clan was extremely famous in the Ninth Mountain and Sea. Currently, a massive airship was flying out of the Li Clan. It was fully 30,000 meters long, and at the front of the ship stood ten clan members, who looked out as the ship shot through the starry sky.</p><p>One of those clan members was an icily arrogant woman who sat ramrod straight at the head of the group. Moonlight flickered in her eyes, and the mark of a willow leaf could be seen on her forehead. Her expression was as cold as freezing ice.</p><p>&#x201C;The Immortal Ancient Dao Medallion must be mine!&#x201D;</p><p>There were two other locations on Planet North Reed where similarly shocking sights could be seen. In one location, an old man suddenly materialized outside the mouth of an enormous volcano. He clasped hands and bowed deeply.</p><p>&#x201C;Young Lord Luodan, the Patriarch has issued a command. He wants you to lead some people to Planet South Heaven. An Immortal Ancient Daoist Rite Temple has been activated. He wants you to go do your best to seize the good fortune.&#x201D;</p><p>Rumble!</p><p>A flame-cloaked figure strode out from inside the volcano. He stopped in front of the old man, whereupon the flames that surrounded him merged together to form a flame crow that perched on his shoulder.</p><p>He was a tall, strapping young man with a scar that ran from his forehead all the way down to his neck, giving him a thoroughly fearsome appearance. His garments were composed of magical flame symbols, merged together into robes.</p><p>&#x201C;I understand,&#x201D; he said coolly, then made his way off into the distance.</p><p>In another location was a pitch-black bamboo forest, within which lurked numerous recently deceased souls that flew back and forth wildly. A young man sat cross-legged on a bamboo stem. He was handsome, with eyebrows like swords and eyes like stars. His eyes shone brightly as he looked over at another nearby bamboo stem.</p><p>On that other piece of bamboo was an old man who resembled a monkey. He was staring at the young man with arrogance and contempt, and the young man was staring back at him.</p><p>&#x201C;You&#x2019;re coming with me!&#x201D; the young man said.</p><p>&#x201C;Like hell I am!&#x201D; the old man replied with arrogant disdain. &#x201C;Your Grandpa Xu has been famous for years. You think I&#x2019;m going to go around with a wimpy little brat like yourself? Scram! If I was like the old me, I would already have beaten the crap out of you!&#x201D; [1. Grandpa Xu is most likely a character from Renegade Immortal named Xu Liguo, who first appeared in <a href="www.wuxiaworld.com">chapter 128</a> of that book]</p><p>&#x201C;I&#x2019;ll remind you I&#x2019;m surnamed Wang!&#x201D; the young man through gritted teeth said.</p><p>&#x201C;Wang Shmong! You bastard!&#x201D; the old man said impatiently. He waved his hand, sending the young man flailing backward, blood spraying from his mouth.</p><p>When he rose to his feet, a ghost flitted over, came to a stop next to the young man, and whispered in his ear. The young man&#x2019;s eyes flickered with irritation.</p><p>&#x201C;You just wait, you crotchety scoundrel! After your Young Master gets the Immortal Ancient Dao Medallion, I&#x2019;m gonna come back here and boil you to death! You belong to me!&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;SCREW OFF!&#x201D; echoed the old man&#x2019;s impatient voice. &#x201C;Listen to Grandpa Xu and screw the hell off!&#x201D;</p><p>The unsealing of South Heaven&#x2019;s Immortal Ancient Daoist Rite Temple sent great waves crashing throughout the entire Ninth Mountain and Sea. In addition to the super planets, there were many other smaller powers who detected the matter. Orders were issued, sending the disciples of many sects to Planet South Heaven to fight for good fortune.</p><p>Even the Ji Clan of the Ninth Mountain was sent into motion. Their clan was located on the peak of the Ninth Mountain, where they ruled over all of the Ninth Mountain and Sea!</p><p>Inside the Ji Clan, several figures approached a teleportation portal. One of them was a tall, slender man who was surrounded by boundless, swirling Karma. It was difficult to clearly make out his features, but the other Ji Clan members backed up as he neared, expressions of reverence and fanaticism on their faces.</p><p>He said nothing as he entered the teleportation portal and sat down cross-legged. When he closed his eyes, boundless Karma surged around him, transforming into thin strands that glowed with brilliant light when they touched each other. Everyone who looked at the scene was dazzled, and felt as if their souls were being tugged over, completely beyond their control.</p><p>&#x201C;This Immortal Ancient Daoist Rite Temple was activated when the Son of Ji is in secluded meditation and can&#x2019;t emerge. I never thought that Ji Yin would chose to go!&#x201D; [1. This &#x201C;Yin&#x201D; is the same yin from yin-yang, which connotes aspects such as the moon, darkness, hidden things, female thing, negative things]</p><p>&#x201C;The year when those three fought over the title of Son of Ji, the Heavens and Earth fell into darkness. Even the sun and moon trembled. The whole Ninth Mountain and Sea was shaken and countless people looked on&#x2026;. In the end, Ji Yin was defeated, and yet, he is still so powerful that he is viewed as a major rival by the Chosen of the Three Churches and Six Sects, the Three Great Clans, and the Five Great Holy Lands.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;In this generation&#x2026; not many could stand up to people like him. Although, I heard that in the Fang Clan there&#x2019;s someone named Prince Wei who beat Ji Yin in a fight once. I&#x2019;m not sure if that&#x2019;s a true story though&#x2026;.&#x201D;</p><p>The whole Ninth Mountain and Sea was in a stir. Countless sects and clans were spurred into motion and sent Chosen disciples toward the lands of the South Heaven, to try to acquire good fortune in the Immortal Ancient Daoist Rite Temple.</p><p>Even the Ninth Sea, which was located between the Ninth Mountain and the Eighth Mountain, was included in the commotion. You could say that it was a sea, but actually, it was composed of countless fragments of heavenly bodies that emanated spiritual energy, which then turned into a sea of mist.</p><p>Rumbling could be heard within that starry sea as an enormous door rose up. As the door appeared above the surface of the sea, countless sea dragons flew out. Trembling, they prostrated themselves in front of the door, which emanated a boundless light, as well as the music of a great Dao. It almost seemed like countless Immortal Divinities were sitting cross-legged in meditation surrounding the door. The energy was completely shocking.</p><p>Slowly, the door opened, giving view to an entire world.</p><p>A woman walked out from that world. She had long hair that stretched all the way to her calves. She was incredibly beautiful, as if all the charm in Heaven and Earth were collected on her person. She emanated the air of an orchid as she waved her hand, causing the door to close behind her and then sink back down to the bottom of the sea.</p><p>&#x201C;Currently, the Three Great Daoist Societies&#x2019; Immortal Ancient Daoist Rite only has four Conclave disciples,&#x201D; murmured the woman. &#x201C;That&#x2019;s one less than my Nine Seas God World. I can&#x2019;t let that daoist medallion fall into anyone else&#x2019;s hands.&#x201D; She took a step forward, and a roaring sea dragon flew out obediently beneath her feet, then carried her off into the distance at top speed.</p><p>In the great Ninth Mountain and Sea, the ancient Fang Clan, the Three Great Clans, the Three Great Daoist Societies, the Five Great Holy Lands, the Three Churches and Six Sects&#x2026; were all mobilized into action. A vast group of Chosen were all heading toward Planet South Heaven.</p><p>-----</p><p><em>This chapter was sponsored by Eric Espinoza</em></p><p>-----</p><p><strong>Note from Deathblade:</strong> Wow, there were a lot of characters introduced in this chapter, few of whom were named.
