<p><strong></strong></p><p>[/expand]</p><p>When the red-haired old man from the Golden Frost Sect saw the blood drop fly out, he loftily said, &#x201C;Patriarch Blood Demon, you&#x2019;re fighting all of us at the same time, and still want to split your attention? It seems you really don&#x2019;t have any regard for us at all.&#x201D;</p><p>At the same time, he performed an incantation, which caused numerous puppets to magically appear around him. Each of the puppets was thirty meters tall, and seemed both real and illusory at the same time. As soon as they appeared, they transformed into beams of colorful light that shot toward Patriarch Blood Demon.</p><p>&#x201C;Patriarch Blood Demon, your destruction is imminent,&#x201D; said the 3rd Li Clan Patriarch. &#x201C;You can&#x2019;t escape our net! Once Mount Blood Demon falls, your true self will face the light of the Heavens and be destroyed in body and spirit!&#x201D; He snorted coldly and then waved his hand, causing the Feng Shui compass to emit blinding light as well as countless magical symbols. The magical symbols formed together into layer upon layer of spell formations as they shot forward.</p><p>Patriarch Blood Demon said nothing, and not even a trace of alarm could be seen on his face. His expression was actually indifferent. No matter what happened, he was confident that he could reverse any setback.</p><p>&#x201C;Senior Blood Demon,&#x201D; said the Dawn Immortal&#x2019;s clone, her voice soft. &#x201C;I know full well that your true self cannot face the glory of the Heavens. You were originally a drop of blood that transformed into a Demon, and the Heavens can turn your true self back into a drop of blood. What I don&#x2019;t know is, at this point&#x2026; what tricks do you have left?&#x201D; Behind her, the ferocious, illusory Resurrection Lily&#x2019;s tentacles whipped about, and an intense pressure radiated out. Rumbling sounds could be heard as countless tentacle incarnations shot out to surround Patriarch Blood Demon.</p><p>The Dawn Immortal was his strongest opponent, so Patriarch Blood Demon focused sixty percent of his attention on her. The other forty percent was divided between the red-haired Patriarch of the Golden Frost Sect and the 3rd Li Clan Patriarch.</p><p>Both parties had each other locked down. Although it looked like they were engaged in magical battle, in reality, both sides were being cautious, waiting for the other to expend enough cultivation base power that, at the critical time, a lightning-like strike could be made.</p><p>Down below, a rumbling sound echoed out over the battlefield. Meng Hao stood inside the second shield layer, the wooden sword swirling through the air around him. A droning sound could be heard from the sword, and pulses of Time power caused the air around it to distort. The Blood Demon Sect disciples were all behind the second shield layer, staring at the hundreds of thousands of cultivators on the other side, as well as the black-robed old man from the Solitary Sword Sect, who was in a frenzy and burning his own longevity to gain power.</p><p>The black-robed old man&#x2019;s fury and frustration was impossible to describe. He wanted nothing more than to slaughter Meng Hao over and over again and then take back the Solitary Sword Sect&#x2019;s precious treasure.</p><p>As he attacked, although he held no sword in his hand, the sword will which emanated out from his body transformed into an amorphous sword which repeatedly slashed into the second shield layer.</p><p>The layers of the Blood Demon Sect&#x2019;s five-layered shield got stronger the closer they got to the sect itself. In addition, the counter-attacks from the shields became even more intense.</p><p>Most importantly, the second shield layer was now the color of blood, thanks to the drop of blood from the Blood Pond inside Mount Blood Demon. Its power was not something that could quickly be broken.</p><p>Furthermore, the second shield layer had not been punctured by the leaf earlier; only the fifth, fourth and third layers had. The second shield layer was intact.</p><p>The shield rumbled and distorted as the black-robed old man vented his fury on it. However, the shield held!</p><p>The Blood Demon Sect forces sat there reticently, as did Meng Hao. He looked out coldly as the black-robed old man attacked and attacked. Killing intent flickered in his eyes, which the wooden sword could apparently sense, as it began to emit an intense droning sound.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The shield vibrated, and the black-robed man fell back. He lifted his head up and roared at the top of his lungs: &#x201C;All cultivators, heed my command! Attack the shield with everything you have! Break it down!!&#x201D;</p><p>The hundreds of thousands of cultivators hesitated for a moment. The first to spring into action were the Solitary Sword Sect disciples. Tens of thousands of flying swords whistled through the air toward the shield. They were followed by the the Golden Frost Sect disciples and the members of the Li Clan. There were also some rogue cultivators. All of them unleashed divine abilities to blast against the blood-colored, second layer shield.</p><p>Instantly, a massive roaring filled the air. The land quaked violently, and nearby vegetation was destroyed. Mountains were leveled, and the entire ground seemed to be gouged out by an entire meter by the force of the combined attack.</p><p>From a distance, the mountain range in which the Blood Demon Sect was located was now crushed into a flat plain. The vegetation in the area was completely dead, and no life existed at all.</p><p>Everything was in ruins, except for the very center of it all, where the blood-colored shield glittered brightly. Although it rippled and distorted violently, it did not fall!</p><p>The Blood Demon Sect&#x2019;s five mountain peaks were now the focus of all attention.</p><p>Aftershocks from the divine abilities exploded out, and the forces of the allied powers also sustained injuries from the backlash, causing countless cultivators to cough up blood and retreat. However, others immediately surged forward to take their place.</p><p>Such a cycle continued on as countless attacks were made.</p><p>The black-robed old man from the Solitary Sword Sect was especially focused on attacking. Every time he made a move, boundless sword qi would rumble out against the blood-colored shield. Two days later, the shield was finally starting to show signs of breakage.</p><p>When the third day arrived, more and more cracks spread out across the blood-colored shield. The Blood Demon Sect disciples sat there silently. Meng Hao&#x2019;s eyes flashed.</p><p>Finally, a snapping sound echoed out. The countless cracks merged together into something that looked like a huge wound. The black-robed Patriarch from the Solitary Sword Sect exploded out with peak Dao Seeking cultivation base power. Natural law descended and swirled about, transforming into an incredible Heavenly sword.</p><p>As soon as the sword appeared, lightning crackled up above. The sword suddenly flashed, seemingly filled with the power of lightning as it shot toward the second shield layer.</p><p>BOOOOMMMMMM!</p><p>The second shield layer could not stand up to the blow. The amorphous sword stabbed into it, and it shattered, sending out a huge shockwave in all directions. The Blood Demon Sect disciples and Meng Hao had already retreated behind the final remaining shield layer.</p><p>&#x201C;Do we fight, Blood Prince!?!?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;The point of death has arrived! It would be better to charge out and slaughter to our heart&#x2019;s content than be stuck in here!&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;If we can&#x2019;t avoid perishing, then let&#x2019;s die in battle!&#x201D; The Blood Demon Sect disciples&#x2019; eyes shone bright red, and even the Spirit Severing experts were looking in his direction.</p><p>This first shield layer was the final line of defense. Once it broke, the Blood Demon Sect would be powerless to defend itself. Hundreds of thousands of cultivators would charge into it. When that happened&#x2026; they might be able to hold out for a little bit, but in the end, they would all die.</p><p>Wang Youcai looked at Meng Hao, awaiting his decision.</p><p>Li Shiqi was also looking at Meng Hao. He was the Blood Prince, and had earned respect through his strength. His lone charge into battle with no thought of personal safety gained him the utmost esteem.</p><p>Everyone was watching him.</p><p>However, Meng Hao&#x2019;s gaze&#x2026; fell upon Xu Qing.</p><p>She had been standing outside of Blood Prince Gorge the entire time watching the battle. Now that Meng Hao looked over at her, she turned to look back.</p><p>In that moment it was just the two of them in the Blood Demon Sect, behind the blood-colored shield, surrounded by the booms from the outside world. They looked at each other, and Meng Hao could see the encouraging look in her eyes. As well as&#x2026;</p><p><em>You live, I live. You die, I die!</em></p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The shockwave from the destruction of the second shield layer faded away, and the black-robed Solitary Sword Sect Patriarch took the lead in the charge. Boundless sword light surrounded him as he shot toward the first shield layer to attack.</p><p>Explosions echoed about everywhere. Of the hundreds of thousands of cultivators from the original force, only around 200,000 were left. All were wounded and tired. The battle had lasted for a long time, and regardless of whether it was in terms of them or the Blood Demon Sect disciples, it had been a long and fierce fight.</p><p>&#x201C;It&#x2019;s almost over!&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;All we have to do is break this final line of defense, and the Blood Demon Sect&#x2026; will be exterminated!&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Four more days! In four days, there will be no Blood Demon Sect in the Southern Domain!&#x201D; The 200,000 cultivators&#x2019; eyes were bright red. Despite their injuries, they roared and attacked the shield with all the strength they could summon.</p><p>RUMMMBLLLLLE!</p><p>The shield rippled. However, this first layer shield was even sturdier than the second layer, and had even more counterattack power. It only took a moment for thunderous roars to rise up into the sky. Clearly, the shield would not break in any short period of time.</p><p>Unfortunately, even a stronger shield would not be able to stand up for very long under the combined assault of 200,000 cultivators.</p><p>&#x201C;Blood Prince, let&#x2019;s fight!!&#x201D; The Blood Demon Sect disciples inside the shield had risen to their feet. Their energy was focused and ready, their killing intent more and more intense than before.</p><p>Meng Hao was silent for a moment, then gritted his teeth and said, &#x201C;Wait four more days!&#x201D;</p><p>His second true self needed exactly that amount of time before it woke up!</p><p>These were the final four days!</p><p>Meng Hao had no way to assess exactly how powerful his second true self would be upon awakening. Had he used something other than the soul of an Immortal, he would have been able to speculate. But since it was an Immortal&#x2019;s soul in his second true self, he had no way to guess. He would have to wait until it awakened&#x2026; to see if it was truly Heaven-defying.</p><p>&#x201C;It HAS to be strong!&#x201D; he thought, looking out beyond the shield.</p><p>One day passed.</p><p>The shield trembled violently under the attacks of 200,000 cultivators, pushing it to its limit. The counterattacks sent out into the 200,000 cultivators caused numerous serious injuries.</p><p>Two days!</p><p>The shield rippled and distorted in virtually every spot, and was even trembling. In fact, cracks were visible in some locations, although they quickly sealed back up.</p><p>The black-robed Solitary Sword Sect Patriarch was on the offensive; every time he launched an attack, the shield seemed as if it might collapse.</p><p>Three days!</p><p>&#x201C;BREAK!&#x201D;</p><p>Rumbling filled the air as, for the first time, a crack spread out that could not be sealed back up. The death knell had been struck for the shield. The 200,000 cultivators had endured counterattacks for three days, which had sapped many of them of their ability to fight, forcing them to retreat from the battlefield.</p><p>The remaining cultivators&#x2019; numbers exceeded 100,000, but they still crowded the battlefield, making it virtually impossible to see the end of the army. As they continued to attack, more and more cracks appeared!</p><p>Finally, the fourth day arrived!</p><p>On the fourth day, the blood-colored shield was covered with cracks. Many of them stretched out and then combined to form huge gaps.</p><p>The shield trembled, and cracking sounds could be heard. It didn&#x2019;t seem like it would be able to hold on for very much longer.</p><p>At the same time, intense killing intent and even madness could be seen in the eyes of the black-robed Patriarch from the Solitary Sword Sect. He suddenly flew high up into the air and then waved his sleeve. Immediately natural law transformed into a sword up above.</p><p>This was his Dao Seeking sword!!</p><p>&#x201C;The Blood Demon Sect will be eradicated on this very day!&#x201D; cried the Patriarch. He pointed out, and the sword rumbled as it shot down toward the shield.</p><p>The Blood Demon Sect disciples were in a frenzy. Their eyes were red, and they were completely ready for the moment when the shield collapsed. Then, they would fight to the death.</p><p>However&#x2026; even as the amorphous sword shot toward the shield, a tremor ran through Meng Hao as he sensed an incredibly familiar aura rising up from within Blood Prince Gorge.</p><p>His eyes glittered. The day he had been waiting for had finally arrived.</p><p>&#x201C;Arise, second true self!&#x201D;</p><p>-----</p><p><em>This chapter was sponsored by Alex Tsue</em></p>
