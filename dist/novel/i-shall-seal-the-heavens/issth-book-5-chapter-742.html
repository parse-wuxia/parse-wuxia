<p><strong>Chapter 742: Time To Come Home, Darling</strong></p><p>As the words left the mouth of the Dawn Immortal&#x2019;s clone, Meng Hao felt the pressure weighing down on him increase. It was as if a will of extermination was about to thoroughly crush him.</p><p>Behind him, the Resurrection Lily was in a frenzy, prismatic colors flickered across it, and its tentacles writhed violently. It even seemed to be emitting voiceless screams.</p><p>Meng Hao felt himself shaking, and he gritted his teeth as he continued to stare at the Dawn Immortal. He had heard of her way back in the Reliance Sect, but it wasn&#x2019;t until this moment&#x2026; that he saw her personally.</p><p>The Dawn Immortal lifted her right hand, within which a leaf appeared. She waved it gently, and brilliant light exploded out as it shot down toward Meng Hao.</p><p>Everything in Heaven and Earth went still except for the leaf. It transformed into a streak of light that instantly bore down on Meng Hao. But then&#x2026; an ancient hand stretched out and grabbed hold of the leaf.</p><p>The hand clenched into a fist, and the leaf was crushed.</p><p>When the hand opened, dust drifted out into the wind.</p><p>The hand belonged to none other than the composite clone of Patriarch Blood Demon!</p><p>&#x201C;Facing the likes of you people, so what if I can&#x2019;t use the Blood Demon Grand Magic?&#x201D; he said coolly. All of a sudden, he was surrounded by the glow of blood, which shot up into the air to encompass even the enormous face up above. Shockingly, a ferocious horn grew out of the face, which suddenly looked exactly like that of the Demonic Incarnation Meng Hao had been in control of earlier.</p><p>&#x201C;Blood Realm, Activate!&#x201D; said Patriarch Blood Demon. Rumbling filled the sky, and red mist roiled out in all directions. At the same time, the Dawn Immortal clone&#x2019;s eyes flickered and she waved her hand, causing a Resurrection Lily to magically appear behind her. It shone with boundless radiance that spread out to battle against Patriarch Blood Demon.</p><p>The black-robed old man from the Solitary Sword Sect, the Golden Frost Sect Patriarch, and the Li Clan Patriarch unleashed divine abilities to aid the Dawn Immortal in resisting Patriarch Blood Demon!</p><p>As for Six-Daos of the Black Sieve Sect, he was just about to lend his assistance when the Dawn Immortal suddenly said, &#x201C;Six-Daos, there&#x2019;s no need for you to participate in this fight. Go wipe out the foundation of the Blood Demon Sect, and destroy Mount Blood Demon. That is where this Blood Demon&#x2019;s true self lies!&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Kill that kid Meng Hao while you&#x2019;re at it!&#x201D; added the black-robed old man from the Solitary Sword Sect. He waved his hand, causing the Solitary Sword Sect&#x2019;s legacy precious treasure, the bamboo sword, to fly toward Six-Daos. &#x201C;Here, I&#x2019;ll even lend you my sword!&#x201D;</p><p>At first, Six-Daos was about to refuse. Seeing Meng Hao slaughter the early Dao Seeking expert from the Solitary Sword Sect had shocked him to the core. When he saw the bamboo sword flying toward him, however, he was suddenly enlivened.</p><p>He was well aware that the Solitary Sword Sect&#x2019;s legacy precious treasure was shockingly powerful. As soon as his hand closed around the hilt, he flickered and shot down toward the ground.</p><p>Patriarch Blood Demon frowned as the rumbling explosions of magical battle filled the air.</p><p>Six-Daos shot down from the sky, eyes fixed on Meng Hao and flickering with the desire to kill. He raised his hand, and the bamboo sword began to emanate blinding light. The air distorted, and an amorphous aura began to seep out from within it. The sword seemed to be emanating the power of Time, and its might was reminiscent of a gigantic mountain.</p><p>Meng Hao&#x2019;s face was unsightly, but as soon as he sensed the aura of the Bamboo Sword, he stared in shock, and a look of disbelief appeared on his face.</p><p>As the sword grew closer, his brow furrowed. Patriarch Six-Daos&#x2019; cultivation base was between the early and mid Dao Seeking stages. However, with the added might of the Bamboo Sword, he was beyond Meng Hao&#x2019;s ability to threaten.</p><p>&#x201C;Get back into the shield!&#x201D; said Meng Hao. He and the rest of the Blood Demon Sect disciples immediately fell back behind the fourth layer of the shield.</p><p>As Six-Daos neared, he laughed coldly and gestured toward the fourth layer of the shield. &#x201C;BREAK!&#x201D;</p><p>The wave of his hand caused an enormous incense burner to appear.</p><p>The incense burner was none other than the Black Sieve Sect&#x2019;s legacy precious treasure, although cracks could be seen on its surface, the result of the pressure exuded by Patriarch Blood Demon&#x2019;s clone back in the Black Sieve Sect.</p><p>The incense burner exuded an ancient aura as it smashed down toward the fourth shield layer.</p><p>A massive boom echoed out. Although the incense burner was cracked, it was still a legacy precious treasure of a great sect. As it smashed downward, shocking green smoke surged out of it, transforming into countless vicious, evil spirits that joined the smashing attack.</p><p>As they neared the shield, cracking sounds could be heard, and the shield began to collapse.</p><p>Thankfully, Meng Hao and the other Blood Demon Sect disciples had already retreated behind the third layer of the shield. As the fourth layer exploded, massive power was unleashed, causing intense vibrations to rock the incense burner.</p><p>Six-Daos laughed coldly, lifting the Bamboo Sword and rotating his cultivation base. The most powerful sword beam he could summon appeared, fully 30,000 meters long, seemingly capable of splitting Heaven and Earth. It was filled with boundless Time power as it slashed down toward the third layer of the shield.</p><p>The bizarreness of the sword was now becoming even more apparent. Gradually, the exterior of the Bamboo Sword was filling with more and more rips and fissures, within which could be seen another sword. It was as if the inner sword were a sapling in springtime, sprouting from a wilted bough!</p><p>An even more intense aura of Time emerged from the sword, causing the black-robed old man from the Solitary Sword Sect to be even more pleased than before.</p><p>Six-Daos was even happier, and he lifted his head up to laugh uproariously. &#x201C;Meng Hao, you&#x2019;re DEAD!&#x201D;</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The third layer of the shield only lasted for the space of a few breaths before it shattered. As it did, Meng Hao&#x2019;s face should have been extremely unsightly, but instead it held an odd expression, and his eyes were glittering.</p><p>&#x201C;Fall back again!&#x201D; he said, leading the Blood Demon Sect cultivators behind the glow of the second shield layer.</p><p>At the same time, the hundreds of thousands of enemy cultivators felt their spirits lifting. They surged toward the Blood Demon Sect as Six-Daos once again unleashed a massive attack toward the second shield layer.</p><p>Night had fallen, and the bright moon hung high in the sky. However, the ground trembled, and the fighting had reached such intensity that no one was paying attention to whether it was day or night.</p><p>&#x201C;Meng Hao, you scamp, the day you stepped foot into the Black Sieve Sect, you must have known that this day would come!&#x201D; As Six-Dao&#x2019;s voice echoed out in all directions, the incense burner rotated in the air above him. The bamboo sword swirled around him, emanating a brilliant aura.</p><p>Six-Dao&#x2019;s eyes were filled with venomous rancor. His animosity toward Meng Hao had long since seeped into his very marrow. He wanted to exterminate the Blood Demon Sect and destroy Meng Hao in body and soul. To achieve that goal, he would sacrifice anything and everything.</p><p>&#x201C;DIE!!!&#x201D; he howled, laughing maniacally as he raised his hand and unleashed the full force of his cultivation base into the bamboo sword, causing it to explode with an incredible sword beam.</p><p>The sword beam was shocking to the extreme!</p><p>Cracking sounds could be heard as the light beam burst out. More tears spread out across the Bamboo Sword and, finally, a bang could be heard as it exploded.</p><p>In the instant in which it was ripped open, shockingly, a wooden sword appeared in its place!</p><p>The wooden sword had been hidden inside the bamboo sword all along! Now that the bamboo sword had shattered, the wooden sword was revealed!</p><p>As soon as it appeared, boundless Time power radiated out, and an incredibly ancient aura flooded the area. Even the Dawn Immortal&#x2019;s and Patriarch Blood Demon&#x2019;s faces flickered when they sensed the aura.</p><p>The black-robed old man from the Solitary Sword Sect was going wild with joy. He lifted his head up and laughed heartily. Although he had loaned the sword to Six-Daos, it was still the legacy precious treasure of the Solitary Sword Sect, something that had been handed down from generation to generation. Despite being in the hands of another, it still belonged to the Solitary Sword Sect; no one could ever steal it away!</p><p>There was one fact unknown to outsiders that was passed down only to the successive generations of Solitary Sword Sect Patriarchs. The primary master of this sword was the Solitary Sword Sect itself. When it was originally discovered, it was actually nothing more than a stick of bamboo which possessed a naturally-occurring, intrinsic sword qi. The Solitary Sword Sect had taken it to be a supreme treasure, and had refined it into a sword. [1. I was curious about what the bamboo sword might look like as opposed to a wooden sword, so I did some image searching on baidu.com. <a href="www.wuxiaworld.com">Check out the interesting results here</a>]</p><p>&#x201C;That&#x2019;s the heart of the bamboo! The heart of the bamboo is transformed into wood, so naturally it would be a sword!!&#x201D; The black-robed old man from the Solitary Sword Sect and Patriarch Six-Daos were both laughing loudly. Six-Daos&#x2019; eyes shone brightly as he abruptly pointed toward Meng Hao.</p><p>&#x201C;DIE!&#x201D; he cried, his voice booming like thunder, and filled with unmatchable confidence. He was absolutely certain that even with the shield protecting him, Meng Hao would definitely die beneath the power of this sword!</p><p>In response to his words, the wooden sword began to rumble and then shot toward the second layer of the shield.</p><p>The hundreds of thousands of cultivators in the area breathlessly watched the dazzling sword and its aura. Shocking pressure emanated from it as it shot magnificently through the air.</p><p>&#x201C;Time became bamboo,&#x201D; murmured the Dawn Immortal, &#x201C;and the bamboo concealed time. It transformed into bamboo wood&#x2026;.&#x201D; Her battle with Patriarch Blood Demon did not slow down, but instead grew even more intense.</p><p>As the wooden sword descended, the ground trembled and fissures appeared, as if it couldn&#x2019;t withstand the incredible pressure of Time.</p><p>The grass withered, and time itself seemed to distort. A Time tempest appeared, shocking the surrounding cultivators, who immediately fell back.</p><p>The sword was now on the verge of slamming into the second shield layer. Inside, the Blood Demon Sect disciples had looks of despair on their faces. In contrast, the surrounding hundreds of thousands of enemies wore expressions of anticipation.</p><p>All eyes were fixed on the sword flying through the air.</p><p>Six-Daos&#x2019; laughter echoed out across the battlefield.</p><p>Meng Hao had an odd expression. Earlier, he had sensed something familiar about the aura of the bamboo sword. When the rips appeared on its surface earlier, that familiar sensation grew stronger. When the bamboo shattered and the wooden sword appeared, a connection appeared between him and the sword that only he could sense!</p><p>He was connected to the wooden sword!!</p><p>At a certain point, a bashful smile appeared on Meng Hao&#x2019;s face, and he cleared his throat. Even as the eyes of all the Blood Demon Sect disciples and enemy cultivators were fixed on the wooden sword, he suddenly stepped out from behind the second shield layer.</p><p>This action immediately attracted everyone&#x2019;s attention, and the buzz of conversation rose up into the air.</p><p>&#x201C;What is he doing? Don&#x2019;t tell me he&#x2019;s going to try to fight the legacy precious treasure of the Solitary Sword Sect!?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;He really overestimates his ability! He might be strong, but he&#x2019;s going to die for sure!&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Hahaha! I never thought someone could be so arrogant! He actually dares to step out from behind the shield? That sword is going to destroy him in body and soul!!&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Looking to die?&#x201D; laughed Six-Daos. He assumed Meng Hao must have become so frightened that he lost his senses. A normal person would never step out from behind the shield, they would cower behind it.</p><p>What attracted even more attention was how Meng Hao not only stepped out from behind the shield, but then stretched his hand out&#x2026; directly toward the shockingly powerful wooden sword that was slashing toward him&#x2026; as if he were beckoning toward it.</p><p>He cleared his throat and then said, &#x201C;Time to come home, darling!&#x201D;</p><p>-----</p><p><em>This chapter was sponsored by Valera McDaniel</em></p>
