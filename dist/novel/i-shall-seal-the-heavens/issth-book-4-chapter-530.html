<p><span style=""></span></p><p><strong>Chapter 530: Slaughter!</strong></p><p>From the very beginning, Meng Hao had kept his Cultivation base in the First Anima, which possessed the battle prowess of one great circle Nascent Soul. However, because of his incredible foundation, his battle prowess actually far exceeded anyone in the same stage as him.</p><p>His attack exploded with the power of extermination.</p><p>The exterminating power stemmed from Meng Hao&#x2019;s Violet Sea and blood totems. They combined to form a powerful Water-type totem that contained both life and death. In Meng Hao&#x2019;s hands, it formed an essence that could send a life back to the dust.</p><p>The mid Nascent Soul Cultivator&apos;s death happened incredibly quickly, literally in the blink of an eye. Everyone watching was instantly shaken mentally. Even Huyan Qing just stood there with that wicked smile of his plastered on his face.</p><p>Sir Wu took a deep breath. As he thought about, he realized that although he could kill a mid Nascent Soul stage Cultivator, it wouldn&#x2019;t be possible for him to do so as casually as Meng Hao just had.</p><p>&#x201C;Now that we&#x2019;ve attacked, we have to kill him!&#x201D; thought Sir Wu, sighing inwardly. His eyes glittered with killing intent as he went on the attack, shooting toward Meng Hao. As he neared, his right hand lifted up in a clawing gesture. Instantly, the air around him transformed into a yellow river filled with roaring waters and yellow sand. It looked like a yellow dragon as it swept out in all directions. In the blink of an eye, it had enveloped the entire area. Shockingly, it then became a spell formation.</p><p>Within the spell formation, yellow sand roared up into the air. A raging wind screamed, transforming into a vortex. It was like a Wind Dragon and a Yellow Dragon, interlocked, pinning Meng Hao down inside.</p><p>At the same time, killing intent radiated out of Sir Wu&#x2019;s eyes. His body flickered as he entered the spell formation, his right hand flashing an incantation gesture. Countless green leaves magically appeared, each one of which contained destructive power. They swirled around, congealing together rapidly to form one sharp sword after another.</p><p>Almost in the same moment that the spell formation finished forming, Sir Wu was closing in on Meng Hao. At this point, Meng Hao suddenly disappeared again. When he reappeared, he was next to another of the mid Nascent Soul stage Cultivators. He reached out in a seemingly leisurely fashion toward the shocked man, then tapped on his forehead.</p><p>BAM!</p><p>The power of extermination once again appeared. The old mid Nascent Soul stage Cultivator&#x2019;s body instantly exploded.</p><p>As he died, another Nascent Soul Cultivator suddenly appeared behind Meng Hao. Around his body rotated nine spinning awls which send out pulsing whimpers and were surrounded by a pulsating green aura that seemed to be filled with extremely toxic poison. The green aura blasted against Meng Hao&#x2019;s face.</p><p>Meng Hao&#x2019;s expression was calm as he completely ignored the poison weapons. He simply raised his hand and pointed.</p><p>Demon Sealing, Eighth Hex.</p><p>The single finger cast a powerful hex which caused the late Nascent Soul Cultivator&#x2019;s body to shake. He suddenly stopped moving, and was stuck there in midair. Having lost his connection to his magical items, they then fell down into the Violet Sea. The man&#x2019;s body hovered in the air motionless. Shock filled his face as he realized that even his Cultivation base was completely sealed.</p><p>&#x201C;This&#x2026;.&#x201D; He couldn&#x2019;t feel shocked for long, because Meng Hao passed him and flicked his sleeve. Roaring waves suddenly surged up from the Violet Sea below, completely submerging the old man.</p><p>Meanwhile, Sir Wu was closing in. Meng Hao turned, completely ignoring him. He waved his arm, causing a bloody glow to rise up into the sky. Shockingly, an enormous blood-colored face suddenly appeared.</p><p>This was the Blood Immortal divine ability. As of now, Meng Hao didn&#x2019;t need to wear the mask to unleash it. As of this point, the mask&#x2026; could be done without.</p><p>The battle power of the great circle of the Nascent Soul stage gathered within the blood-colored mask. Sir Wu&#x2019;s face filled with shock as the face slammed into him with an enormous boom. The leaves surrounding him shattered into pieces, and he was sent tumbling backward, blood spraying from his mouth. Before he could emerge from within the sandstorm spell formation, Meng Hao teleported behind him, then lifted up his right hand and pointed.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>A jade slip appeared in front of Sir Wu. It emanated a soft glow which resisted Meng Hao&#x2019;s finger. However, it only lasted for the space of three breaths before it collapsed.</p><p>Sir Wu coughed up more blood. However, he used the three breaths worth of time to employ a blood escape technique to speed away. Even as the blood escape technique was unleashed, Meng Hao&#x2019;s cold voice could be heard in his ear.</p><p>&#x201C;Blood?&#x201D;</p><p>It was only a single word, but it caused a roaring to fill Sir Wu&#x2019;s body. Even in the midst of using his magical escape technique, he was injured again. His face fell. Disregarding the pain, he quickly retrieved a second jade slip from his bag of holding which he violently crushed between his fingers. Another protective shield spread out to surround him and defend against Meng Hao&#x2019;s second finger attack.</p><p>A popping sound rang out as the second shield shattered. Sir Wu was finally able to flee outside of the sandstorm spell formation. In that instant, he lifted his head up and roared. Hair disheveled, he performed a double-handed incantation gesture, causing the spell formation&#x2019;s sandstorm to whip about and block the area between him and Meng Hao.</p><p>As soon as the sandstorm touched Meng Hao, he stopped moving, unable to continue forward. He looked up and saw Sir Wu on the other side, wiping the blood from the corner of his mouth and staring back tenaciously at him.</p><p>Sir Wu was filled with shock. Just now, their brief encounter in the spell formation caused him to realize just how valiant and fearsome Meng Hao was. If it weren&#x2019;t for the two life-saving jade slips bestowed upon him by Patriarch Huyan, he would certainly have perished just now.</p><p>&#x201C;Guard the spell formation with all your power,&#x201D; he said through clenched teeth. &#x201C;This man must die!&#x201D;</p><p>The faces of the remaining three Nascent Soul Cultivators were pale. The scene they had just witnessed had left them completely shaken. Huyan Qing&#x2019;s eyes were wide with disbelief.</p><p>The sandstorm was filled with shocking killing intent as it closed in around Meng Hao. On the outside, Sir Wu&#x2019;s eyes filled with a strange glow. He flashed a double-handed incantation, causing the sandstorm to tighten around Meng Hao. The other three Nascent Soul Cultivators went all out with the power of their Cultivation bases to assist.</p><p>Meng Hao began to move forward. Booming sounds filled the air as the Wind Dragon and the Yellow Dragon inside of the spell formation roared and interlocked. Meng Hao&#x2019;s body trembled and he was forced backwards a few paces, his eyes shining with a strange light.</p><p>&#x201C;Interesting,&#x201D; he said coolly. &#x201C;It has some impressive sealing power.&#x201D; Outside the spell formation, Sir Wu smiled coldly. He performed an incantation with his right hand and then pointed forward.</p><p>&#x201C;Eight Dragons Defense Expulsion!&#x201D; Suddenly, a second Wind Dragon appeared within the spell formation, then a third, then a fourth. Three more Yellow Dragons also appeared.</p><p>In total, there were eight dragons cycling about. Their appearance caused the spell formation to be even more shocking than before. Each grain of sand in the storm was equipped with the power of an early Nascent Soul stage Cultivation base. The dense masses of sand suddenly began to congeal together, rapidly transforming into more than ten figures. More sand began to congeal, and more figures appeared.</p><p>This spell formation was Sir Wu&#x2019;s trump card. Considering how seriously he took Meng Hao, he didn&#x2019;t hesitate to use the spell formation&#x2019;s true power.</p><p>This aspect was not actually a formation, but rather, the magical manifestation of a divine ability. In the past, he had relied on its intense power to kill three powerful experts of the same level as himself.</p><p>Seeing that Meng Hao was incapable of escaping from within the spell formation, Huyan Qing breathed a sigh of relief. He stood there in the sedan chair, laughing.</p><p>&#x201C;Let&#x2019;s see how you charge out now! Sir Wu&#x2019;s Sandstorm Noose has been praised even by my father. You&#x2019;re dead! No one has ever dared to provoke me. Since you did, since you dared to threaten me, you&#x2019;re going to die!&#x201D;</p><p>Meng Hao smiled a cold smile. As the spell formation rotated around him, four of the dragons emitted roars of shocking power. There were now over twenty congealed sand figures as well. Each of the figures possessed a Cultivation base of the mid Nascent Soul stage. Harboring no fear of death whatsoever, they immediately charged directly toward Meng Hao. They did not unleash divine abilities, but rather&#x2026;.</p><p>&#x201C;BURST!&#x201D; howled Sir Wu. This was the deadly function of the spell formation, the self-detonation of the divine ability!</p><p>Every detonation was completely equivalent to the self-detonation of a mid Nascent Soul stage Cultivator. The power of twenty mid Nascent Soul stage self-detonations was something that would strike fear into the heart of even someone of the great circle of the Nascent Soul stage.</p><p>By relying on the power of this spell formation&#x2019;s divine ability, Sir Wu had earned a high reputation in the Heavenly Pursuit Tribe. Throughout all the Black Lands, he was ranked as one of the most powerful experts under the Spirit Severing stage. Were that not the case, Patriarch Huyan would not have assigned him the job of protecting his only son.</p><p>Right now, his expression was calm and his heart proud as he looked coldly at Meng Hao within the spell formation.</p><p>&#x201C;It doesn&#x2019;t matter how shocking your Cultivation base is. Within my eight dragons spell formation, you can only curse your own bad fortune. There is no one else to blame.&#x201D;</p><p>The other three old men outside the spell formation wore expressions of pleasant surprise, along with vicious, murderous intent. They smiled coldly as they looked at Meng Hao, who seemed to be trapped like a cornered beast within the spell formation.</p><p>Huyan Qing&#x2019;s laughter became ear-splitting.</p><p>Within the spell formation, Meng Hao watched on as the twenty mid Nascent Soul figures began to self-detonate, then coolly said, &#x201C;Interesting. I never imagined that after coming out of secluded meditation that I would run into someone so strong. It looks like you have the qualifications to make me enter my...</p><p>&#x201C;Second Anima!&#x201D;</p><p>Boom!</p><p>Meng Hao&#x2019;s body instantly grew more powerful. He grew half a head taller, and his shoulders widened. His physical body grew stronger as he was filled with the battle prowess of two great circle Nascent Souls. When he looked up, his eyes shone brightly. Popping sounds could be heard coming from within his body as his aura climbed up. Instantly, the faces of the Cultivators outside of the spell formation filled with intense shock.</p><p>It was at this moment that the more than twenty mid Nascent Soul self-detonations exploded out. The power unleashed was shocking, but Meng Hao&#x2019;s expression was the same as ever. He moved forward through the explosions, which didn&#x2019;t even cause him to tremble in the slightest. The sight caused Sir Wu to gasp. His pupils constricted; he was stupefied.</p><p>As for the three other old men, they were even more astonished and filled with disbelief.</p><p>&#x201C;Just&#x2026; just what level Cultivation base does he have?!?!&#x201D;</p><p>Even as shock caused the four men&#x2019;s hearts to tremble, Meng Hao shot up into the air. He flew with incredible speed toward Sir Wu. A boom could be heard as he burst out from within the spell formation. The eight dragons roared and tried to encircle him, but Meng Hao waved his hand toward them. Instantly&#x2026; eight enormous blood-red faces appeared. As soon as they appeared, they exploded, transforming into an attack that swept out in all directions.</p><p>Eight bloodcurdling howls could be heard as the dragons were shredded into pieces. The sandstorm spell formation shuddered three times, and then collapsed into fragments. Everyone on the outside of the spell formation was filled with shock. Meng Hao suddenly disappeared, then reappeared directly in front of shocked Sir Wu.</p><p>The collapse of the spell formation caused Sir Wu to cough up a mouthful of blood. However, he was an old hand at close-quarters combat. Without hesitation, he fell back, both hands flashing in an incantation gesture. Instantly, wind and sand surrounded him, forming a shield, along with a third jade slip, adding even more protective power.</p><p>Unfortunately&#x2026; as soon as Meng Hao appeared, he pointed with his finger. The shield of wind and sand was ripped apart. The light from the jade slip lasted only for the space of a single breath before collapsing. Sir Wu let out a miserable, despairing cry as Meng Hao&#x2019;s finger tapped onto his forehead.</p><p>All it took was one tap.</p><p>Bam!</p><p>The power of extermination exploded out within Sir Wu. His body exploded out in all directions. It didn&#x2019;t matter that he was of the great circle of the Nascent Soul stage. Meng Hao was currently equipped with twice that level of power. As for Sir Wu&#x2026; how could he possibly fight back?!</p><p></p>
