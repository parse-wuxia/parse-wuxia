<p><strong>Chapter 615: Speculation and Cooperation</strong></p><p>&#x201C;This continent is like a mirror, and within the mirror is a battlefield,&#x201D; murmured Meng Hao. &#x201C;The objects on the battlefield can emerge into the outside. However&#x2026; those same objects still remain on the battlefield inside the mirror&#x2026;.</p><p>&#x201C;This&#x2026; this&#x2026;.&#x201D; Meng Hao&#x2019;s mind was filled with intense rumbling. He was starting to feel that he knew what was happening, but the explanation caused him to begin to pant, and his face to flicker.</p><p>&#x201C;Strange, it&apos;s so similar to the copper mirror and its duplication powers!&#x201D; That was what caused him to be so agitated.</p><p>He was the only person who could make such a connection. No one else had his copper mirror, nor did they know of the mirror&#x2019;s Heaven-defying qualities. Therefore, it would naturally be impossible for anyone to reach the same conclusion.</p><p>After all, everyone&#x2019;s thinking is limited by the scope of what they know. Thinking outside of one&#x2019;s own scope is something extremely difficult.</p><p>Meng Hao&#x2019;s breathing grew heavier the more he thought about it. The situation just seemed to become more and more bizarre. His eyes flickered, and he suddenly leaped up into the air. He did not proceed along in the same direction he had been traveling, but rather, went straight up into the air.</p><p>As he rose up, his heart began to pound faster, and he grew more nervous. He had possessed the copper mirror for many years now, and in the past, he had often wondered where it came from. However, the meat jelly and parrot were always very enigmatic when it came to the subject. Every time he brought it up, they acted like it was some type of taboo. The parrot would even begin to fume with rage.</p><p>Meng Hao had tried to get information about it on numerous occasions, all to no avail. Eventually, he put the matter to rest inwardly. Now, however, he had the feeling that he suddenly had an opportunity to understand more about the copper mirror!</p><p>It was in such a mental state that he flew higher and higher. Moments later, he had reached the highest area possible. Down below, the continent stretched out in all directions. He took a deep breath as he lowered his head to look down.</p><p>As before, the continent looked completely endless. The surface was sleek and glossy, and it was impossible to see what the continent actually was shaped like.</p><p>&#x201C;I could keep going and look for the border. Maybe I can find some answers there.</p><p>&#x201C;Or, I could take out the copper mirror and shine it down. Perhaps&#x2026; that would reveal some clues!&#x201D; He thoughtfully rubbed his bag of holding, a profound look gleaming in his eyes.</p><p>He had the feeling that if he produced the copper mirror, but nothing happened, then it wouldn&#x2019;t really matter. However, if any types of transformations did occur, then&#x2026; they would certainly be enough to shake Heaven and Earth. In fact, considering how many people were here, it would be impossible to keep the matter of the copper mirror hidden unless he killed everyone.</p><p>&#x201C;The copper mirror is the most mysterious object I possess. I can&#x2019;t let anyone know that I possess it, otherwise it will lead to terrible calamity.</p><p>&#x201C;&#x2018;The innocent man will be lead to disaster by possessing a treasured object!&#x2019;&#x201D; Meng Hao&#x2019;s eyes glittered. He had been intelligent even as a child, and had experienced the law of the jungle in the Cultivation world. The truth of what would happen should he reveal the copper mirror was something he knew all too well.</p><p>After some thought, Meng Hao&#x2019;s eyes flickered, and he turned to look off into the distance, a cold smile tugging at his lips.</p><p>Even as he smiled, distortions appeared in the air in the direction in which he was looking. An old man emerged. It was none other than the emaciated Cultivator from before. He had been approaching in secret, but as soon as he neared, had been detected by Meng Hao. Without waiting for Meng Hao to say anything, he revealed himself.</p><p>&#x201C;Fellow Daoist Meng, your Cultivation base is extraordinary. It seems I&#x2019;ve incurred your ridicule.&#x201D; The old man laughed and then clasped hands and bowed.</p><p>Seeing that Meng Hao wasn&#x2019;t going to say anything, the old man smiled and continued, &#x201C;My name is Han Danzi [1. Han Danzi&#x2019;s name in Chinese is &#x97E9;&#x4E39;&#x5B50; h&#xE1;n d&#x101;n z&#x1D0;. Han is a common family name, and yes, it is the same character as Han Bei. That doesn&apos;t mean they are related, although the possibility couldn&apos;t be precluded based on the name alone. Dan means &#x201C;red&#x201D; or &#x201C;pellet.&#x201D; Zi means &#x201C;child&#x201D; or &#x201C;son&#x201D;], a rogue Cultivator from the Southern Domain. Your fame has resounded like thunder in my ears for many years, Fellow Daoist Meng. Grandmaster Pill Cauldron is an example for all Cultivators like myself. I can&#x2019;t tell you how happy I am to be able to meet you here in the ancient Demon Immortal Sect.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Did you really secretly follow me just to say some fawning words?&#x201D; said Meng Hao, a cold glint in his eyes. &#x201C;State your purpose.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Fellow Daoist Meng, you don&#x2019;t beat around the bush!&#x201D; He laughed, apparently ignoring Meng Hao&#x2019;s tone of voice. &#x201C;I could see you hesitating about what to do earlier. I&#x2019;m not sure exactly what you were thinking about, but I was curious, so I followed you.</p><p>&#x201C;However, now that you mention it, I actually do have something interesting to share with you.</p><p>&#x201C;The greatest treasures hidden in this place are not the magical items of the Cultivators and the Demon Tribes, but rather&#x2026; the objects held in the hands of those three Paragons. Whether it be the spear, the seven globes of fire and wood, or those two pearls, each and every one are shocking precious treasures.</p><p>&#x201C;Any one of them would enable a Cultivator to murder an Immortal!&#x201D; As Han Danzi spoke, he observed Meng Hao to see how he might react. However, Meng Hao&#x2019;s expression did not reveal even the slightest bit of a change in his mood.</p><p>&#x201C;This guy is smart and has a rock-hard will,&#x201D; thought Han Danzi with an imperceptible frown. &#x201C;I won&#x2019;t be able to fool him easily&#x2026;.&#x201D;</p><p>Meng Hao&#x2019;s expression was the same as ever as he looked coldly at the old man. For some reason, the old man caused a feeling of vigilance rose up within him. He appeared to be at the great circle of the Nascent Soul stage, not very far from Spirit Severing.</p><p>However, what he had accomplished earlier with the flame bird was not something that a great circle Nascent Soul Cultivator should be able do. This man clearly was hiding something mysterious. Perhaps others might not be able to sense it, but as the Ninth Generation Demon Sealer, Meng Hao could tell that the man actually had two auras.</p><p>The first contained the ripples of a Cultivator&#x2019;s Cultivation base. The other&#x2026; was deeply hidden, and had&#x2026; Demonic Qi!</p><p>This Demonic Qi was borderline vile!</p><p>Han Danzi looked at Meng Hao and said, &#x201C;I can&#x2019;t get the treasured items of those three Paragons by myself. That is why I hope to form a cooperation with you, Elder Brother Meng. After we acquire the treasures, we can split them evenly.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Which one do you want to acquire?&#x201D; asked Meng Hao, his eyes glittering.</p><p>&#x201C;The seven globes of fire belonging to the Demon Tribes Paragon, of course,&#x201D; said Han Danzi with a smile. &#x201C;At the very least, we can extract one for each of us. That way we won&#x2019;t waste any energy.&#x201D;</p><p>Meng Hao also smiled. He did not refuse, but instead, nodded in agreement.</p><p>Seeing Meng Hao agree so easily caused vigilance to rise up within Han Danzi. Previously, of all the people who came from South Heaven, he had paid closest attention to Patriarch Huyan.</p><p>However, he had recently been shocked to sense that Patriarch Huyan had been killed. Later, when laid eyes on Meng Hao, he understood that Patriarch Huyan was most likely killed by him.</p><p>When he thought about his own techniques and trump cards, Han Danzi felt at ease. With a hearty laugh, he and Meng Hao turned into colorful beams of light that shot off into the distance.</p><p>Meng Hao didn&#x2019;t speak at all. He temporarily suppressed any notions of producing the copper mirror. Now was not the time. He needed to wait until the right critical juncture had arrived, then he would pull out the copper mirror to see if it provoked any transformations.</p><p>It seemed that Han Danzi was bringing him to just such a critical juncture.</p><p>Of course, Han Danzi was wrapped up in his own thoughts as the two of them proceeded onward. Before long, they reached what was actually the very center of the whole continent.</p><p>&#x201C;The locations of the three Paragons are actually where the seal is strongest over this ancient battlefield,&#x201D; said Han Danzi with a smile. &#x201C;There are some special restrictive spells which prevent anyone from even getting close.</p><p>&#x201C;However, I happen to know of a special technique. I tested it out earlier, and it seems possible to bypass the restrictive spells. However, it requires a certain level of Cultivation base. Elder Brother Meng, considering how extraordinary your Cultivation base is, I don&#x2019;t think you will have any problems.&#x201D; With that, he shot down toward the continent below. He quickly performed an incantation with his right hand, then pushed down onto the surface of the continent.</p><p>Instantly, the land shook, and Meng Hao could see a vortex forming inside the mirror. There was no black hole within it, though, and it maintained its shape. At the same time, Han Danzi took a deep breath and lifted his hand back up. Then he stood; the vortex remained within the mirror.</p><p>Han Danzi turned to look at Meng Hao.</p><p>&#x201C;Elder Brother Meng, presumably, you know what to do. I&#x2019;ll wait for you up ahead.&#x201D; With that, his body flickered and he moved forward. As he moved, the vortex beneath his feet followed him.</p><p>Meng Hao&#x2019;s eyes glittered as he watched Han Danzi proceed onward for what appeared to be several hundred meters. However, he had actually not traveled for several hundred meters, but several hundred kilometers!</p><p>&#x201C;Interesting,&#x201D; murmured Meng Hao. He moved down toward the surface of the land, then landed on its surface. After that he lifted his foot up and slammed it down onto the ground. A boom could be heard, and then, shockingly, a vortex appeared beneath his feet inside the world of the mirror.</p><p>It maintained its vortex state, not forming into a black hole, but rather, connecting to Meng Hao&#x2019;s Cultivation base. Then Meng Hao proceeded forward. For every meter he moved&#x2026; he actually moved half a kilometer!</p><p>&#x201C;What a technique!&#x201D; he thought, his eyes flickering. He couldn&#x2019;t help but think that if this technique could be used in the outside world, it would definitely be considering an incredibly powerful divine ability.</p><p>Using this technique, Meng Hao and Han Danzi moved what appeared to be several hundred meters, but was in fact hundreds of kilometers. They sped along at top speed within the center region of the mirror continent.</p><p>At the same time, the other Cultivators from South Heaven were in other locations, attempting to acquire their own bits of good fortune. They continued to stimulate the surface of the land, attempting to cause it to spit out magical items. However, most of the magical items ended up being destroyed in the process of emerging.</p><p>Few of the Cultivators were actually able to acquire anything.</p><p>Even still, the mirror-like land was like a huge treasure trove for everyone. All of the Cultivators who had come to this place were profoundly wise and intelligent, and soon, their glittering eyes came to be drawn to the center region of the land. That was clearly the location of the three most powerful experts who split everything under the Heavens.</p><p>In fact, there were more than a few people who were trying to make their way in that very direction.</p><p>Two hours passed. Shockingly, Meng Hao and Han Danzi had just appeared in the area near the Greater Demon with the seven rotating globes of fire.</p><p>A strange light appeared in Han Danzi&#x2019;s eyes. He took a deep breath as he exchanged a glance with Meng Hao. At the same time, he began to rotate his Cultivation base. Meng Hao directly entered the Fifth Anima; his fleshly body was shocking, and his Cultivation base boundless. Han Danzi&#x2019;s eyes flickered as he too unleashed his full power. The twisted Demonic Qi within him also began to circulate.</p><p>The two attacked the surface of the land together, causing an enormous rumbling to fill the air. The two vortexes beneath them in the world of the mirror suddenly touched each other. They merged, then suddenly ripped open an enormous black hole.</p><p>The gravitational force that suddenly surged out was impossible to describe. However&#x2026; it was incapable of causing the seven globules of fire to even tremble in the slightest. In contrast, quite a few other magical items in the area were sucked into the vortex.</p><p>Ten magical items were sucked in, but only five flew out. They shot up into the air in beams of prismatic light. Han Danzi&#x2019;s eyes flickered, but he did nothing to attempt to take them. Meng Hao&#x2019;s eyes also flashed, yet he did not chase after the items either.</p><p>Both of the men were wrapped up in their own thoughts as they watched the five beams of light shoot like beautiful pearls up into the sky.</p><p>At the same time, the other Cultivators from South Heaven watched on in shock. The looked at the five beams of light, and could sense the intense ripples emanating out from within.</p><p>&#x201C;Incredible treasure!!&#x201D; That was the thought that ran through all of their minds. Their eyes shone brightly as they flew up into the air. In the blink of an eye, nearly all of the South Heaven Cultivators flew from all directions toward the five beams of light.</p><p>-----</p><p>Han Danzi</p><p>[audio mp3=&quot;http://www.wuxiaworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/han_danzi.mp3&quot;][/audio]</p>
