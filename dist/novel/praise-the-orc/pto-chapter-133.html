<p><span>Chapter 133 - Mountain of Sabres, Forest of Swords (2)</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p><p><span>&#x201C;Phew, it is nice and warm,&#x201D; Crockta muttered.</span></p><p><span>It felt like all his fatigue from his adventure in the north dispersed as he immersed himself in the hot water.&#xA0;</span><span>This was a public bathroom in the basement of their inn.&#xA0;</span><span>Crockta glanced elsewhere. Anor was looking around with an awed expression, amazed at the hot water that appeared like magic.&#xA0;</span><span>When faced with the level of civilization in Quantes, he didn&#x2019;t stop asking questions like a curious little boy.</span></p><p><span>&quot;I guess Tiyo&#x2019;s still playing around.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;It&#x2019;s been a while so he will be unburdening his heart.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Tiyo had yet to return.&#xA0;</span><span>The members of the Quantes Gnomes Garrison welcomed his return and held a big celebration. Obviously, his stories about their adventures in the north would be greatly exaggerated.</span></p><p><span>Kenzo&#x2019;s voice was suddenly heard from where his body was buried in the bathtub.&#xA0;</span><span>&quot;It is lacking compared to natural hot springs, but this type of bath is still good. Having such a facility in an inn, Quantes is great.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;I guess you like hot springs.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Of course. Where I used to live, there was a famous hot spring and the hot sulfur water was like paradise itself. There are many good elements for the body.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Considering the place where he used to live, the white star on his forehead, and the name Kenzo, Crockta guessed that he was Japanese.&#xA0;</span><span>He looked at Crockta and said, &quot;But when is training...?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;I don&#x2019;t want to sweat again after bathing, so we will start tomorrow.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;I understand.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Crockta decided after seeing Kenzo&#x2019;s swordsmanship.&#xA0;</span><span>The two wouldn&#x2019;t have a great teacher and student relationship, but rather one where he would advise Kenzo on his skills while they stayed in Quantes.</span></p><p><span>Crockta was pleased by Kenzo&#x2019;s decision.&#xA0;</span><span>If this was any game, he could become stronger just by hunting. But Elder Lord was different.&#xA0;</span><span>Many users appreciated the importance of meeting a good teacher because enlightenment and competence could make a big difference.&#xA0;</span><span>Kenzo felt the desire not to miss out on this opportunity.</span></p><p><span>&quot;We have been in here for a while. Get up soon.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Yes.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Crockta raised his body.&#xA0;</span><span>The sound of someone humming was getting closer and Crockta wanted to leave the bath before it became noisy.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Ohh! Everybody is here! Kahahat!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Tiyo drunkenly staggered into the bathroom.&#xA0;</span><span>The guests not from Crockta&#x2019;s group glared at the appearance of a drunkard.</span></p><p><span>&quot;Ah, I made a noise. I&#x2019;m sorry </span><i><span>dot</span></i><span>. Kyahahaha!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Tiyo twisted and fell down. Then he raised his head and smiled again.&#xA0;</span><span>He wasn&#x2019;t himself right now.&#xA0;</span><span>Crockta exchanged glances with Anor. Someone had to take care of the drunkard. If they left him alone, he might die from placing his head under the water all night.</span></p><p><span>The two reached out at the same time.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Hat!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x2018;&quot;Yap!&quot;</span></p><p><span>Rock paper scissors!&#xA0;</span><span>Crockta won. Anor sighed and trudged over to handle Tiyo while Crockta looked at him and laughed.</span></p><p><span>&quot;Just like a nanny.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Anor grabbed Tiyo. Anor was in the process of raising Tiyo up when the drunken gnome &#xA0;suddenly jumped and plunged into the big bathtub. Water splashed everywhere.&#xA0;</span><span>Anor grabbed his head and forced Tiyo to apologize to the guests around them.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;I&#x2019;m sorry, I&#x2019;m sorry. This friend has no wisdom.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Sorry </span><i><span>dot</span></i><span>, uhihi.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;No, what is with this attitude? Bow your head!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>There were no problems because it was Anor.</span></p><p><span>Crock and Kenzo walked out of the public bath together.&#xA0;</span><span>Attention was focused on the fierce orc warrior Crockta and the slightly lacking, but still well-disciplined human warrior Kenzo.&#xA0;</span><span>They stood tall and put on their clothes.</span></p><p><span>&quot;Do you want to drink beer?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Okay.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>After the bath, they headed up to the pub on the first floor of the inn.&#xA0;</span><span>Several gnomes were gathered and drinking alcohol.&#xA0;</span><span>Crockta and Kenzo sat down and ordered beer. The gnome employee brought them cold beer and dry snacks.&#xA0;</span><span>It was a special order made to fit the size of an orc and human.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;You...&#x201D;&#xA0;</span><span>Crockta opened his mouth, making Kenzo stop as he was about to take a sip.</span></p><p><span>&quot;Ah, yes.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Why do you want to become stronger?&quot;&#xA0;</span><span>Crockta asked with a deep expression in his eyes.</span></p><p><span>It was an important question.&#xA0;</span><span>He wanted to teach someone but he didn&#x2019;t want to do something wrong. That&#x2019;s why he recalled the best teacher that he knew.&#xA0;</span><span>Baek Hanho&#x2019;s face surfaced but was quickly replaced by the great warrior Lenox.&#xA0;</span><span>Harsh, severe, yet passionate. Because he was there, Crockta could become who he was now.</span></p><p><span>Crockta became Lenox and looked at Kenzo.&#xA0;</span><span>Deep eyes that seemed like they could penetrate straight through him.</span></p><p><span>&quot;......!&quot;</span></p><p><span>Kenzo gulped.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>There was common knowledge that every user in Elder Lord knew.&#xA0;</span><span>NPCs considered this world to be real and everyone had their own philosophy.&#xA0;</span><span>Users needed to breathe and consider this a real world; their mindset was expressed as the assimilation rate.&#xA0;</span><span>If he answered with the flimsy mindset of a user, he might not be able to learn from this orc.</span></p><p><span>He closed his eyes and concentrated. He asked himself: &apos;Why do I want to become stronger?&apos;</span></p><p><span>His previous memories passed by.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;I...&quot;</span></p><p><span>He was a common otaku.&#xA0;</span><span>He wasn&#x2019;t a hikikomori who always stayed in his room, but a friendly sales office worker caught up in the turmoil of society.&#xA0;</span><span>He just had a secret hobby of anime appreciation and figurines collection.&#xA0;</span><span>And the character he loved the most was&#x2026;</span></p><p><span>Sword demon Matsui!</span></p><p><span>He was a character who had a bad personality, smoked cigarettes, and always had a dull expression on his face. His hobbies were Pachinko and Mahjong, and was a man who always drunkenly wandered the streets with matted hair.</span></p><p><span>However, at night, he became the city&#x2019;s dark knight who wielded his magical claymore against the monsters who killed his former lover.&#xA0;</span><span>He was always cynical and committed criminal acts casually, but at crucial moments, he became the anti-hero who helped the weak.</span></p><p><span>Kenzo went to a dojo that taught swordsmanship because of him. However, he couldn&#x2019;t wield the sword like Matsui in reality. He plunged into the world of Elder Lord to be like Matsui.&#xA0;</span><span>But he lacked the abilities to be a hero. The same was trying for gaining higher levels. The wall of the NPCs and creatures was high.</span></p><p><span>In Elder Lord, he was just an ordinary warrior with a sword.</span></p><p><span>Kenzo opened his mouth, &quot;Become stronger...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>His current assimilation rate was over 60%. It was the highest it had ever been.</span></p><p><span>&quot;I want to help people who have fallen into despair.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>It was the reason why he admired and wanted to be like Matsui.&#xA0;</span><span>At one time, he had severe fright of human relationships. He was bullied on a daily basis at school. At that time, it was a friend who saved him.</span></p><p><span>A friend who learned karate. He knocked out the people tormenting Kenzo. Kenzo expressed his gratitude, but the friend just asked for a banana milk and handed him a book.&#xA0;</span><span>It was Miyamoto Musashi&#x2019;s The Book of Five Rings.&#xA0;</span><span>Then he disappeared with the words to not be pathetic. It was more shocking because he was a person who normally didn&#x2019;t speak a lot.</span></p><p><span>Kenzo read The Book of Five Rings all night. Then he started changing from that day.&#xA0;</span><span>He tried to fix his passive attitude and to get along with the people in his surroundings. Therefore, he could take his place in society.</span></p><p><span>A single person&#x2019;s hand was enough to save him.&#xA0;</span><span>If one person hadn&#x2019;t showed up, he would&#x2019;ve continued to just sink.&#xA0;</span><span>He wanted to be that one person to reach out his hand to people in despair.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;I see.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span><span>Crockta nodded. Kenzo&#x2019;s serious heart was conveyed.</span></p><p><span>Kenzo replied firmly again, &#x201C;That&#x2019;s right.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;People who have fallen into despair...&#x201D;&#xA0;</span><span>Crockta contemplated his words before faintly smiling.&#xA0;</span><span>He beckoned, &quot;Drink.&quot;</span></p><p><span>Crockta drank his beer in one gulp.&#xA0;</span><span>Kenzo supported his neck and did the same.&#xA0;</span><span>The large glass filled with beer was gone in a flash. Both of them downed the beer in one shot.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Kuoooh!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Ugh!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>It was a universal sound after drinking. The two of them shook as they felt the aftermath of the beer.</span></p><p><span>&quot;Then go to sleep early. My approach is tough so tomorrow will be a hard day.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>They were set to stay a week in Quantes.&#xA0;</span><span>It was enough time for Tiyo to meet his family and friends, as well as prepare for the trip. Of course, Anor also needed to see the city.&#xA0;</span><span>Meanwhile, Crockta would preach his enlightenment to this man.</span></p><p><span>The two of them headed up to their room.</span></p><p></p><p style="text-align: center"><span>***</span></p><p></p><p><span>Kenzo couldn&#x2019;t sleep because his heart was pounding.</span></p><p><span>He needed to focus properly during this week with the orc. He had already taken some time off at his company.&#xA0;</span><span>It was a strong desire to learn everything from this NPC, an orc who could instantly slay an ogre. Maybe he could obtain a hidden class or skill from this.</span></p><p><span>He moved his gaze.&#xA0;</span><span>Crockta wasn&#x2019;t sleeping yet.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;......?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>He was sitting on the bed with his eyes closed. The faint moonlight leaking through the window showing his serenity.</span></p><p><span>&quot;......!&quot;</span></p><p><span>At that moment, he felt the same energy as when the ogre was slain.&#xA0;</span><span>A hazy atmosphere appeared around Crockta&#x2019;s body. It was like he was separated from the world.&#xA0;</span><span>His flesh became distant and he seemed to disappear from Kenzo&#x2019;s perspective.&#xA0;</span><span>There was an invisible aura moving through the air. It was calm and silent, but Kenzo&#x2019;s muscles shook like he was on the battlefield.</span></p><p><span>It was a strange phenomenon.&#xA0;</span><span>Kenzo kept lying down as he forgot the time. Some time passed.</span></p><p><span>Crockta opened his mouth.&#xA0;</span><span>&quot;When you reach this level, you can practice without even breaking a sweat.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;......!&quot;</span></p><p><span>He was aware of the fact that Kenzo was watching.</span></p><p><span>&quot;Keep in mind that in this world, the will of an individual can make a big difference.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>It was something Crockta had learned directly.</span></p><p><span>In reality, no matter how much he trained his will, he couldn&#x2019;t jump a few meters or break a rock. Even if he practiced for a lifetime, he might be able to kill a wild animal with his bare hands. Limits existed.</span></p><p><span>But this was the world of Elder Lord. A person could grow infinitely if they trained and had a strong will.&#xA0;</span><span>A place where the possibilities of individuals were expanded beyond infinity, that was Elder Lord.&#xA0;</span><span>Crockta realized this from Hoyt, then he reached a higher ground due to Gushantimur.</span></p><p><span>Now it was possible to simulate a fight with a virtual enemy by raising his will and imagining it.&#xA0;</span><span>The realm of a Hero beyond the Pinnacle.&#xA0;</span><span>Crockta knew this very well, so he planned to help Kenzo experience the realm of the Pinnacle in this week.</span></p><p><span>Seeing was believing.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Sleep. Tomorrow, you will regret not sleeping earlier.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Ah, I understand.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Kenzo hurriedly closed his eyes.&#xA0;</span><span>Maybe he would experience something life-changing tomorrow.&#xA0;</span><span>Elder Lord was a symbol of this era. Even if he wasn&#x2019;t a ranker, there were many users who earned a big profit through Elder Lord. It usually depended on how strong a person was and their level.</span></p><p><span>Through this opportunity, he could hopefully become a professional user who earned a living through Elder Lord.&#xA0;</span><span>It was the dream of all Elder Lord users.</span></p><p><span>He couldn&#x2019;t wait for tomorrow&#x2019;s training.&#xA0;</span><span>He didn&#x2019;t worry much.&#xA0;</span><span>No matter how harsh the training was, it wouldn&#x2019;t kill him.</span></p><p><span>But...</span></p><p><span>It actually happened.</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p><p><a href="www.wuxiaworld.com">Glossary of Common Korean Terms.</a></p><p>Praise the Orc:&#xA0;<a href="docs.google.com">Glossary Link.&#xA0;</a></p><p>Current schedule:&#xA0;There will now be 14 chapters a week, meaning two chapters every day.</p><p>I have also updated my&#xA0;<a href="www.patreon.com">Patreon</a>&#xA0;to reflect my new novels.
