<p><span>Chapter 136 - Mountain of Sabres, Forest of Swords (5)</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p><p><span>&#x201C;......&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Kenzo grabbed his head.</span></p><p><span>&quot;......!&quot;</span></p><p><span>He slammed his head into the table.&#xA0;</span><span>The nearby gnomes looked up at his behavior.</span></p><p><span>&quot;Hey, young man.&quot;&#xA0;</span><span>A large, muscular gnome approached. Contrary to his manly body, his face showed the traces of time.&#xA0;</span><span>&quot;I don&#x2019;t know what it is, but it seems like you are worried about something.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>He placed a big beer glass in front of Kenzo. It seemed bigger in comparison to the average gnome&#x2019;s size.&#xA0;</span><span>In the hands of the muscular gnome, the beer looked even bigger.</span></p><p><span>&quot;I&apos;ll buy you a glass.&quot;</span></p><p><span>&quot;...Thank you.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>This was Quantes Bar.&#xA0;</span><span>It was located near the inns, but it was a place where men drank forlornly under the dim lighting.&#xA0;</span><span>They both drank the beer at the same time.</span></p><p><span>&quot;Yes, what is worrying you? Is it okay if I listen once?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Kenzo looked at the man, studying his wrinkled face and his deep eyes. He looked like a senior in his past life.</span></p><p><span>There was a strange mood.</span></p><p><span>In reality, he had no such experiences. At most, there were salary men who got drunk and old men whispering about the past. They didn&#x2019;t care of other drunk people.&#xA0;</span><span>It was a bleak period where people became suspicious of any young person who entered a bar.</span></p><p><span>But because he watched a lot of dramas and movies, Kenzo felt like he could get something from this man.&#xA0;</span><span>In movies, weren&#x2019;t there always advisers who gave answers when protagonists lost their way?&#xA0;</span><span>This gnome&#x2019;s appearance seemed to suggest that.</span></p><p><span>&quot;My problem...&#x201D;&#xA0;</span><span>Kenzo opened his mouth.&#xA0;</span><span>It was just an artificial intelligence anyway. He could confess his problem without any hesitation.&#xA0;</span><span>&quot;I am learning under someone right now. He asked me to do one thing, but I will be in a difficult position if I do it. So, should I do this or not...?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Kenzo was troubled.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>They might be moneylenders, but they were still users.&#xA0;</span><span>It was their play style to attack NPCs.&#xA0;</span><span>They didn&#x2019;t consider it a crime to act against NPCs. If Kenzo attacked them, he could be stigmatized as someone who attacked fellow users.</span></p><p><span>That was the source of his troubles.</span></p><p><span>&quot;I don&#x2019;t know the details, but you seem to be in a rough spot.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;That&#x2019;s right.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>The gnome touched his chin and ordered something from the bartender.</span></p><p><span>&quot;Bartender. Please do what I asked before.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;I understand.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>The bartender approached with something.&#xA0;</span><span>The gnome laughed and shook the contents of the bottle.</span></p><p><span>&quot;This is Mukarasanebo.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Mukarasanebo...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>It was a very precious wine in Elder Lord.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Yes. Did your teacher make you do that while knowing your position is difficult?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;That&apos;s not it. He doesn&#x2019;t know about my position.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span><span>He couldn&#x2019;t explain to Crockta about the relationship between users.</span></p><p><span>&quot;He doesn&#x2019;t know?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Yes. He won&#x2019;t understand.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;I see. Huhuhu.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>The man laughed and poured Mukarasanebo into their cups.&#xA0;</span><span>Kenzo quietly stared without drinking.</span></p><p><span>&quot;This precious thing...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;It&#x2019;s okay. Drink.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Thank you.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Kenzo and the gnome drank the Mukarasanebo. He could feel the unique aroma and taste; it was indeed worthy to be a product called the nobility of wine.</span></p><p><span>&quot;Do you know why your teacher did it?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Well, that...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Crockta hadn&#x2019;t mentioned why he wanted Kenzo to get rid of the moneylenders.&#xA0;</span><span>Maybe it was to get rid of the bad guys harming the city or there was a hidden element that Kenzo didn&#x2019;t know.</span></p><p><span>The gnome laughed.&#xA0;</span><span>&#x201C;You don&#x2019;t know anything about each other.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;......&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Then is your mentor a trustworthy person?&quot;</span></p><p><span>Kenzo thought about it. Was Crockta trustworthy?&#xA0;</span><span>He didn&#x2019;t know much about Crockta.&#xA0;</span><span>Unlike the image of his species, he was very gentlemanly until he turned into an unmatched warrior in battle.&#xA0;</span><span>But Crockta had saved him from the creatures in the forest. When Kenzo asked to be taught and said that it was to help people, he nodded with a satisfied expression.&#xA0;</span><span>It was a short time, but Kenzo could feel what he was like as a person.</span></p><p><span>Kenzo nodded.&#xA0;</span><span>&#x201C;Yes. He is.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>The gnome smiled and said, &quot;Then trust him.&quot;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Huh?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;I could tell the answer just by looking at your face.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span><span>The gnome shook the Mukarasanebo. There wasn&#x2019;t much left. He gave Kenzo the last cup.&#xA0;</span><span>&quot;It is a precious drink but you can have the last cup.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Kenzo looked at the cup and shook his head.</span></p><p><span>The gnome said, &quot;I&apos;ll tell you my story. I have lived my whole life in Quantes, but I am leaving today.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Today?&quot;</span></p><p><span>&quot;As you can see from the Mukarasanebo, I had a lot of money. I was a successful businessman, but thanks to a little mistake, I&#x2019;ve lost everything. All I have now is my body, so I am going to another city to work.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>The gnome&#x2019;s expression was so serene that Kenzo couldn&#x2019;t imagine such a story.&#xA0;</span><span>The gnome continued speaking, &#x201C;It is because of a loan.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;......!&quot;</span></p><p><span>Kenzo&#x2019;s eyes widened.</span></p><p><span>&quot;A friend who was my most reliable adviser told me not to trust them, but I believed I could control everything. They used a crafty method to cause me to pay a tremendous amount of money. I shouldn&#x2019;t have believed in the foreigners who suddenly appeared...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>He laughed bitterly, &quot;I lost everything.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Kenzo couldn&#x2019;t say anything. The weight of his life felt like it was pushing down on his shoulders.</span></p><p><span>&quot;Somehow, I feel like I caused your mood to become worse.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Ah, no.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Either way, everything is your choice. But if someone you trust is giving you advice, you should listen.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>The gnome rose from his spot.&#xA0;</span><span>Kenzo tried to catch him, but the gnome had already stepped back.&#xA0;</span><span>&quot;I was lonely but I&#x2019;m glad I got to meet you at the end. This is the last of the Mukarasanebo, the last cup. Please enjoy it slowly.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>He handed money over to the bartender.&#xA0;</span><span>They briefly exchanged glances. The gnome must have a long relationship with the bartender here.</span></p><p><span>&quot;Be well.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;You too.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>The gnome left the bar, walking in a regal manner under the moonlight.</span></p><p><span>Kenzo looked at the clear liquid in the cup. Mukarasanebo, the wine that was called nobility due to its flavor.&#xA0;</span><span>He raised the last cup to his mouth.</span></p><p><span>It was bitter.</span></p><p></p><p style="text-align: center"><span>***</span></p><p></p><p><span>Kenzo moved through the darkness.&#xA0;</span><span>It wasn&#x2019;t difficult to find the users in Quantes. He tracked those who showed suspicious tendencies.&#xA0;</span><span>They were careful, but he had imitated a ninja and learned tracking and stealth skills.</span></p><p><span>In the process, he learned how they tightened the noose.&#xA0;</span><span>They lent money to people. They used tricks to increase the interest rates, harassing those who couldn&#x2019;t pay it off.&#xA0;</span><span>By the way, a lot of gnomes were deceived. The inhabitants of Elder Lord were familiar with these tricky methods, so they had no choice but to believe.</span></p><p><span>In addition, there were users who bribed the officials of Quantes. The gnomes who appealed to the officials were dismissed.</span></p><p><span>The gnome who gave Kenzo the Mukarasanebo had also been hit like this.&#xA0;</span><span>The users were reproducing the scams of reality in the game.</span></p><p><span>&quot;Why aren&#x2019;t you giving me the money?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Money, I don&#x2019;t have it. I just borrowed 100 silver but the interest rate...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;It is written! Didn&#x2019;t you see the contract?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;I tried to pay it back but you weren&#x2019;t there...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Then try to find us! It can&#x2019;t just be given to you! Do whatever it takes! Am I wrong? You should be familiar with all the people here.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span><span>They were no different from the gangsters, or Yakuza, in reality.&#xA0;</span><span>&quot;If you don&#x2019;t have the money, there is this. Your house. Sell your house. Then all the money will be paid back. Eh?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;This house has been in my family for generations...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Then give us the money!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Hiik!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>There was a disturbance as the furniture in the house started to be smashed.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;P-Please stop!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;The money?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;......&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Nothing?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;The rate is too...we no longer...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Then get out of this house! Foreclosure!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Users armed with weapons and armor entered the house and threatened the gnomes.&#xA0;</span><span>The guards of Quantes arrived after being informed of the turmoil. The users immediately changed their attitude, showing their papers and letters.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Ah! You worked hard! We&apos;re a little noisy, so we&#x2019;re sorry. Do you see these papers here? We are doing legitimate work. Don&#x2019;t worry.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>The guards faced the users and saw that there were no problems with the documentation. They looked at each other and nodded.&#xA0;</span><span>&quot;Please be careful of making a lot of noise. A report was received.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Ah. I&#x2019;m sorry. Hahaha.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Then.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>After the guards left, it was a repetition of the previous situation.</span></p><p><span>&quot;Typical NPCs. Kukuk. Hey guys, shake this house. What is going to happen?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Brother. Is this little one yours?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>It happened when they tried to touch the family of the victim.</span></p><p><span>Kenzo felt something inside him break.&#xA0;</span><span>A memory from his past.&#xA0;</span><span>Whenever he was bullied, he could endure anything about himself; however, he couldn&#x2019;t stand any insults to his family. However, he didn&#x2019;t have the power to resist.&#xA0;</span><span>The wounds from that period time still hadn&#x2019;t healed, and felt like it had festered over with gangrene.</span></p><p><span>It was why he wanted to become like a hero in cartoons and help people.</span></p><p><span>&#x2018;Don&#x2019;t be stupid.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span>Kenzo revealed his body and entered the house.&#xA0;</span><span>The people inside were bewildered at the emergence of another user and called out, &quot;Who is it?&quot;</span></p><p><span>Kenzo replied with his sword instead of words.&#xA0;</span><span>He was a high-level user, and in recent days, he had gone through Pinnacle training with Crockta.&#xA0;</span><span>The overall level of the users had increased a lot, but he could nonetheless slaughter these types of people.</span></p><p><span>His claymore slashed at the users.&#xA0;</span><span>They turned into white particles in an instant. The only gnome NPC working with the moneylenders was trembling.&#xA0;</span><span>Kenzo grabbed his collar and demanded.</span></p><p><span>&quot;If you don&#x2019;t want to die, tell me where all the people in your organization are.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>The gnome started thinking.&#xA0;</span><span>Kenzo swung his greatsword. A few pieces of hair from the gnome fell down. If it was a little more angled, the gnome would&#x2019;ve died instantly.&#xA0;</span><span>The gnome shook.</span></p><p><span>&quot;This is your last chance. One. Two...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>The gnome came clean before he finished speaking.&#xA0;</span><span>He told Kenzo all the important points, including the number of people in their group and the position of the leader.&#xA0;</span><span>Kenzo gained the information and brandished his sword. The gnome&#x2019;s head was hit and he fainted.</span></p><p><span>The night wasn&#x2019;t over yet.&#xA0;</span><span>Kenzo began to move. The moneylenders were spread all over the place, but their core force was together.&#xA0;</span><span>Kenzo dealt with the remnants. He repeated this work until it was daytime.</span></p><p><span>As the users got in contact with each other, he soon became surrounded by a lot of them.</span></p><p><span>Strong.&#xA0;</span><span>A few were on a level similar to Kenzo.&#xA0;</span><span>This made it more annoying.&#xA0;</span><span>The level of the users was good enough not to bother anyone this way. Nevertheless, they gave out loans and bullied anyone who couldn&#x2019;t pay.</span></p><p><span>It didn&#x2019;t matter that they were committing evil against NPCs.&#xA0;</span><span>Just...he remembered the deep eyes of the gnome who bought him the Mukarasanebo.&#xA0;</span><span>There was also the face of the child who looked up at the users surrounding him with fear.&#xA0;</span><span>The family begging for the child not to become hurt.&#xA0;</span><span>The mother&#x2019;s tears as she embraced her children.</span></p><p><span>All of this meant he couldn&#x2019;t hold back his irritation.&#xA0;</span><span>He couldn&#x2019;t bear these feelings and wielded his blade.</span></p><p><span>&quot;You are a user like us. What are you trying to do?&#x201D; They asked him.</span></p><p><span>Kenzo ignored them and rushed in.&#xA0;</span><span>It was an unfavorable fight.&#xA0;</span><span>There wasn&#x2019;t much difference in level and they outnumbered him. Maybe some of them were superior to Kenzo. He was alone.</span></p><p><span>However, it didn&#x2019;t feel like that.&#xA0;</span><span>He grasped his claymore and recalled the time with Crockta.&#xA0;</span><span>Swords were flying towards him.&#xA0;</span><span>There were many of them. A fast speed.&#xA0;</span><span>He shouldn&#x2019;t have been able to avoid them.</span></p><p><span>However, Kenzo didn&#x2019;t die.</span></p><p><span>[Your assimilation rate has risen.]</span></p><p><span>[Your assimilation rate has risen.]</span></p><p><span>[Your assimilation rate has risen.]</span></p><p><span>[Your assimilation rate has risen...]</span></p><p><span>Unity with the world.&#xA0;</span><span>The world of Elder Lord was pushing at his back.</span></p><p><span>Kenzo gripped his claymore and plunged into the encirclement.</span></p><p><span>Then.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>The world slowed.</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p><p><a href="www.wuxiaworld.com">Glossary of Common Korean Terms.</a></p><p>Praise the Orc:&#xA0;<a href="docs.google.com">Glossary Link.&#xA0;</a></p><p>Current schedule:&#xA0;There will now be 14 chapters a week, meaning two chapters every day.</p><p>I have also updated my&#xA0;<a href="www.patreon.com">Patreon</a>&#xA0;to reflect my new novels.
