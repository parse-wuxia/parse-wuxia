<p><span>Chapter 141 - When I was down (1)</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p><p><span>Crockta cocked his head as he walked down the street.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Execute me? Kulkulkul.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>What cute people.&#xA0;</span><span>They had accidentally captured him, and yet they were confident that they could execute him?&#xA0;</span><span>Their actions were too hasty.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Edgar. Do you only have this much?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Crockta remembered drinking with Edgar, the one who imprisoned him.&#xA0;</span><span>Edgar might&#x2019;ve forgotten it, but Crockta remembered the stories that were shared.&#xA0;</span><span>He was a decent man.&#xA0;</span><span>Crockta appreciated the fact that he noticed Crockta&#x2019;s identity and quickly imprisoned him, as well as Edgar&#x2019;s cold and rational behavior in front of his men.</span></p><p><span>Edgar did what he had to do.&#xA0;</span><span>Their positions were different. As the leader of a group, he was a man who knew exactly what he had to do.&#xA0;</span><span>Kill the symbol of the enemy. The more that morale fell, the less the enemies would be able to fight back.</span></p><p><span>However, the opponent was Crockta. Edgar was too impatient.</span></p><p><span>&quot;You said that a leader should be a castle,&#x201D; Crockta muttered.</span></p><p><span>Edgar had drunkenly told Crockta, </span></p><p><span>&apos;I&#x2019;m the leader. The leader, a castle. Who would want a castle who shakes when the wind blows? I must be an unshakable castle. Cool and hard. Sometimes it is hard, but it is part of being a man. Brother!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Who was Crockta to judge a man acting like a solid castle?</span></p><p><span>&quot;Well, put in front of a bit person like me, he will just get hurt.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Crockta nodded.&#xA0;</span><span>It was unfortunate.&#xA0;</span><span>Crockta had decided on war on the Heaven and Earth clan. Therefore, if they wanted to execute him, Crockta would come to them directly.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Hey.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span><span>Crockta approached a user on the street.&#xA0;</span><span>He had hidden himself as soon as Crockta appeared and kept looking at Crockta.&#xA0;</span><span>He was one of the clan members who had been standing next to Edgar.</span></p><p><span>&quot;......!&quot;</span></p><p><span>He thought that he had hidden himself well, but Crockta easily found him.&#xA0;</span><span>Crockta grinned in a relaxed manner. The other person turned pale.</span></p><p><span>&quot;Did you think you would stop me with steel bars?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;How...?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Tell this to Edgar. I never run away.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span><span>Crockta touched the handle of Ogre Slayer.&#xA0;</span><span>&#x201C;You guys have nominated the place so let&#x2019;s play properly. If you win, it will be a wonderful execution like you planned.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;......!&quot;</span></p><p><span>&quot;If you are scared then you can back out. The Heaven and Earth clan is only this much. Kulkul.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>The user stared blankly at the laughing Crockta.&#xA0;</span><span>They were eyes filled with faith.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Hey, Orc. You have no clue about the Heaven and Earth Clan. Okay, then I&#x2019;ll see you later. Let&#x2019;s see how your smug face becomes distorted.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Hoh. That seems good.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span><span>Crockta also laughed and then raised a fist as he hitthe user&#x2019;s forehead.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Aack!&#x201D;&#xA0;</span><span>It was very painful because his knuckles were solid.&#xA0;</span><span>The user grabbed his forehead with a yelp.&#xA0;</span><span>&#x201C;What?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Do you have any complaints?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;......&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Don&apos;t be cocky.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>The chance was good, but the user was annoying, so Crockta had used violence.&#xA0;</span><span>This was Elder Lord, a world where the fist was similar to the&#xA0;</span>law.&#xA0;<span>The user shook because he didn&#x2019;t dare go against Crockta.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;You, I&#x2019;ll see you later!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>He snapped at Crockta and ran away. Crockta gazed after him and laughed.</span></p><p></p><p style="text-align: center"><span>***</span></p><p></p><p><span>The plains outside Maillard.&#xA0;</span><span>There was a group of humans.&#xA0;</span><span>The lead warrior was Edgar. As he waved the flag of the Heaven and Earth Clan, the users following him shouted.&#xA0;</span><span>It was a sign of fear to anyone playing Elder Lord.&#xA0;</span><span>This flag had flown on devastated battlefields. The name &#x2018;Heaven and Earth&#x2019;, the strongest clan in Elder Lord.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;No matter how skilled or powerful Crockta is, he can&#x2019;t deal with all of us.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span><span>Someone next to Edgar said. Edgar nodded. His expression was still cool and sober.</span></p><p><span>&quot;The hastily collected mercenaries can disturb our rhythm.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span><span>Not all of them were the Heaven and Earth members, as he gathered people to participate in the battle using money.</span></p><p><span>&quot;Nevertheless, there is still a lot of room.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Yes.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Deal with Crockta. And...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>He looked around.&#xA0;</span><span>He didn&#x2019;t feel anyone approaching.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;These rehabilitation people who will come.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>They announced that they would publicly execute Crockta. It was to stimulate the Rehabilitation Brothers.&#xA0;</span><span>The Rehabilitation Brothers, whose power started in Maillard, weren&#x2019;t large in number. However, they stuck together and obstructed the Heaven and Earth Clan.&#xA0;</span><span>The mission of the Heaven and Earth branch in Mallard was to mainly keep them in check.</span></p><p><span>This time, if possible, he would put an end to them as well as Crockta.&#xA0;</span><span>For the sake of today, Edgar had harshly trained his clan members and helped them level up.&#xA0;</span><span>The Heaven and Earth&#x2019;s leadership trusted him and appointed him in charge of Maillard, so he would do what was necessary to get results.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;He isn&#x2019;t coming.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;It seems like it.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Time passed by Crockta didn&#x2019;t show. The sun was slowly moving above their head. The clan members started murmuring.</span></p><p><span>&quot;Everyone, don&#x2019;t be shaken.&quot;&#xA0;</span><span>Edgar calmed everyone.</span></p><p><span>&quot;Is he imitating Miyamoto Musashi?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;...Crockta doesn&#x2019;t know Musashi, but he is a warrior who has gone through many battles. He might instinctively be aiming for a similar effect.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Japan&apos;s swordsman Miyamoto Musashi deliberately arrived late for his duel with Sasaki Kojiro, messing with Kojiro&#x2019;s composure. This allowed Musashi to gain a psychological advantage in the ensuing duel.&#xA0;</span><span>It was uncertain if this story was true, but based on the situation with Crockta, it seemed to be effective.</span></p><p><span>Some members were nervous and others were too excited.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Will he really come?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;......&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Edgar was silent.&#xA0;</span><span>He had a point.&#xA0;</span><span>Edgar might be deceived by the title of Righteous Orc, the honorable warrior. If he lured them here and went elsewhere...</span></p><p><span>Edgar looked up at the sky again and saw that the sun was started to descend. The appointed time had already passed.&#xA0;</span><span>His back started tingling. Right now, he had gathered all of the clan members. In other words, there was a minimum number of people at their facilities in Maillard.</span></p><p><span>The number was too small to fight against Crockta.&#xA0;</span><span>It would be a big loss if those facilities were destroyed.&#xA0;</span><span>Crockta had escaped from the prison by luring Lee Jungmin. He wasn&#x2019;t merely a strong warrior. He was a fighter who didn&#x2019;t hesitate to use sneaky plots.</span></p><p><span>He was known as a righteous orc, but inside he was more cunning.</span></p><p><span>Edgar snapped at his members.&#xA0;</span><span>&#x201C;Leave...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>However, he couldn&#x2019;t say anything else.&#xA0;</span><span>There was a group coming from far away.</span></p><p><i><span>Ching.</span></i> <i><span>Ching.</span></i> <i><span>Ching.</span></i></p><p><span>It was the sound of steel armor. Edgar sighed.</span></p><p><span>&quot;They have come.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>They were waving a flag with the letters &#x2018;Rehabilitation&#x2019; on it!&#xA0;</span><span>There was no one in Maillard who didn&#x2019;t know the &#x2018;Rehabilitation&#x2019; flag. The members of Rehabilitation Brothers.</span></p><p><span>&quot;It is a joke when I look at it.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Unlike the Heaven and Earth&#x2019;s uniform, the Rehabilitation Brothers members were all dressed freely.&#xA0;</span><span>The Heaven and Earth gazed at them fiercely, and the Rehabilitation Brothers responded with bloody gazes.</span></p><p><span>&quot;All this tension.&quot;</span></p><p><span>The members of the Rehabilitation Brothers stood before them.&#xA0;</span><span>Since they were non-clan users, their equipment and combat power was less than the Heaven and Earth Clan.&#xA0;</span><span>But they were armed with a strong will and never retreated in the face of the Heaven and Earth Clan.</span></p><p><span>The one who led the Maillard branch of the Rehabilitation Brothers was the hunter class &#x2018;Robina&#x2019;, who was rumored to be a national representative in archery.&#xA0;</span><span>She came forward and spoke to Edgar.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Is it hard to see my face?&#x201D;&#xA0;</span><span>Robina grinned.</span></p><p><span>Edgar didn&#x2019;t smile.</span></p><p><span>&quot;Where is Crockta? I heard there was an orc wandering around and that he is called Crockta. You do have him right?&#x201D;&#xA0;</span><span>She looked around.&#xA0;</span><span>&quot;Where is he?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Not here.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;What are you talking about?&quot;</span></p><p><span>&quot;He escaped.&quot;</span></p><p><span>She narrowed her eyes, but once Edgar&#x2019;s expression didn&#x2019;t change, she burst out laughing.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Hahahahat, I knew it. How would you be able to catch Crockta?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;......&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;How dull.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span><span>She shrugged.&#xA0;</span><span>&quot;Then and now, you are always disappointing me.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Edgar&apos;s face twitched.&#xA0;</span><span>He closed his eyes so that his face wouldn&#x2019;t twist.&#xA0;</span><span>He settled his emotions and thought about a cool lake to sink his head into. An unshakable and serene water surface with no ripples.&#xA0;</span><span>His emotions faded.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Robina. They don&#x2019;t have Crockta so can&#x2019;t we fight? Just looking at the traitor&#x2019;s face makes my stomach hurt,&#x201D; said the man standing next to Robina.</span></p><p><span>At that moment, the Heaven and Earth members simultaneously raised their weapons.</span></p><p><span>&quot;Shut up. If you talk to Edgar like that, we will kill you without mercy.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;I&#x2019;ll kill him right away and stop his stomach from hurting.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Edgar, let&#x2019;s kill them.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Edgar opened his eyes. </span></p><p><span>Robina&#x2019;s face was clear.&#xA0;</span><span>At one time, they were together.&#xA0;</span><span>Edgar was once a member of Rehabilitation Brothers.</span></p><p><span>He said, &quot;I wanted to get rid of you along with Crockta anyway.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Is that so?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;This is the last offer. Take everything you own and leave Maillard.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>It was a proposal that couldn&#x2019;t be accepted.</span></p><p><span>Edgar&#x2019;s Heaven and Earth members were ready to fight as their blades shone under the sun.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Do you really have to do this?&#x201D;&#xA0;</span><span>Robina said while stepping back.&#xA0;</span><span>Her fingers moved to her quiver. Her strong point was her continuous fire. An arrow would leave the bow as soon as there was the slightest movement.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;I never thought you were a man like this. Ah, there is a lot of disappointment.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span><span>She said with a smile</span></p><p><span>&quot;Disappointment...&#x201D;&#xA0;</span><span>Edgar repeated her words and then began to laugh.&#xA0;</span><span>However, his lungs and diaphragm were cramping and he didn&#x2019;t know if it was really laughter. He just smiled as emotions clashed inside him.</span></p><p><span>&quot;Yes, how can we understand others?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Edgar pulled out his sword.&#xA0;</span><span>The momentum of the clan members was pushing at his back.&#xA0;</span><span>It was the feeling of being uplifted. But he couldn&#x2019;t get too excited. &#xA0;The fact that there were trustworthy allies calmed him down.</span></p><p><span>He looked at the Rehabilitation Brothers. At one time, he was with them.&#xA0;</span><span>Now they were Edgar&#x2019;s enemies.&#xA0;</span><span>He turned towards Robina in the front.&#xA0;</span><span>She was still beautiful.</span></p><p><span>&quot;Heaven and Earth!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>At one time, they had been lovers.&#xA0;</span><span>She was a special existence to him.&#xA0;</span><span>Once he fell into hell, he was so caught up in his own problems that he couldn&#x2019;t look around and she left him.&#xA0;</span><span>After losing the special figure in his life, he felt like he had lost the whole world.</span></p><p><span>But now it was different.&#xA0;</span><span>He was more special than her.&#xA0;</span><span>He would climb to the top. He would climb until she could no longer be seen.&#xA0;</span><span>So he didn&#x2019;t feel regret anymore.&#xA0;</span><span>He was just a little sad.</span></p><p><span>&quot;War!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>In the future, his exciting adventure would continue to unfold and she couldn&#x2019;t accompany him.</span></p><p></p><p style="text-align: center"><span>***</span></p><p></p><p><span>&#x201C;Hah, so those two were dating each other</span><i><span> dot</span></i><span>?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;It isn&#x2019;t obvious based on their conversation, but he confessed all sorts of things to me while drunk. Kulkulkul! Things like &#x2018;I love her more than life.&#x2019; Aigoo.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;It sounds like a play. Their relationship, that is.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Crockta was chewing on fried corn with Tiyo and Anor.</span></p><p><span>&quot;Who will win?&quot;</span></p><p><span>&quot;I guess the Heaven and Earth Clan.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Rehabilitation </span><i><span>dot</span></i><span>! The rehabilitation group will win! Look at the strong eyes of that girl </span><i><span>dot</span></i><span>! It is like frost covering the sea </span><i><span>dot</span></i><span>!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>They hid behind a rock and watched the battle between the Heaven and Earth Clan and the Rehabilitation Brothers.&#xA0;</span><span>The two groups failed to notice as the fierce fight began. In its own way, it was a battle between two clans in Elder Lord.&#xA0;</span><span>But it seemed dull compared to the great battles they fought in the north.</span></p><p><span>&quot;I don&#x2019;t like the small number of people </span><i><span>dot.</span></i><span>&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>The scale was much smaller than the desperate battle between the dark elves and orcs of the Great Clan.</span></p><p><span>&quot;Don&apos;t say that. War isn&#x2019;t a game.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span><span>Anor started arguing with Tiyo.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;I-I&#x2019;m just saying <em>dot</em>.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Just saying what? Tsk tsk.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;......&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>As Edgar pursued Robina, she retreated while firing arrows.&#xA0;</span><span>As the two lovers transformed into enemies aiming weapons at each other, the hands eating the fried corn became busier.</span></p><p><span>&quot;But Crockta, shouldn&#x2019;t you help? Aren&#x2019;t the Rehabilitation Brothers Crockta&#x2019;s allies while the Heaven and Earth Clan are your enemies?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>The Rehabilitation Brothers had shown up to rescue Crocktam but now Crockta was just watching.&#xA0;</span><span>Anor&#x2019;s eyes narrowed.</span></p><p><span>&quot;I don&apos;t know.&quot;</span></p><p><span>Edgar stumbled as Robina&#x2019;s arrow pierced his shoulder.&#xA0;</span><span>Crockta focused even more. He chewed on the fried corn as his eyes sharpened.&#xA0;</span><span>In a fight like this, it was best to watch them struggle first. Besides, users would survive even after dying.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;I&#x2019;ll just watch first.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Good attitude <em>dot</em>!&quot;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Phew.&#x201D;</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p><p><a href="www.wuxiaworld.com">Glossary of Common Korean Terms.</a></p><p>Praise the Orc:&#xA0;<a href="docs.google.com">Glossary Link.&#xA0;</a></p><p>Current schedule:&#xA0;There will now be 14 chapters a week, meaning two chapters every day.</p><p>I have also updated my&#xA0;<a href="www.patreon.com">Patreon</a>&#xA0;to reflect my new novels.
