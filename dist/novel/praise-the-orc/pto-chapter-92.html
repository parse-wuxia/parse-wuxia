<p><span>Chapter 92 - Nameragon (1)</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p><p><span>&quot;Thanks again.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Crockta extended a fist to Gushantimur and the other creatures. It was the first time the creatures experienced the orc&#x2019;s greeting and they bumped fists with glee. In particular, the ogre looked at Crockta with passionate eyes as they said farewell.</span></p><p><span>The cyclops stared with his one eye and said slowly, &quot;Next. You. I. Fight.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Kulkulkul. I&apos;m looking forward to it.&quot;</span></p><p><span>The cyclops had been watching Crockta since he first came. There was no opportunity to compete since he received guidance from Gushantimur all day.&#xA0;</span><span>The cyclops was bigger than the ogre and was full of hulking muscles!&#xA0;</span><span>It would be an exciting match.</span></p><p><span>Tiyo was chatting with the goblin archer as well as the kobold guerilla archer.&#xA0;</span><span>&quot;Next time we meet, I will turn you into a bee&#x2019;s nest with Vulcan.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;</span><i><span>Kyak</span></i><span>! I will drill a hole in your abdomen, a perfect hole </span><i><span>kyak</span></i><span>!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;I will make you a tomb of arrows!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>It wasn&#x2019;t a good conversation but he could feel their desire not to say goodbye.&#xA0;</span><span>Anor also exchanged farewells with the lich. The lich and its skeletons waved their handkerchiefs towards Anor.</span></p><p><span>Gushantimur was last.&#xA0;</span><span>The mysterious hermit of the Black Forest.&#xA0;</span><span>His true identity was a friendly black dragon who helped practitioners break through the walls they encountered.</span></p><p><span>&quot;Listen to the very end.&quot;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;That&#x2019;s okay </span><i><span>dot.</span></i><span> I will hear it next time </span><i><span>dot</span></i><span>.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Gushantimur spoke to Tiyo.&#xA0;</span><span>Gushantimur knew right away that Tiyo was Hedor&#x2019;s son. They had a similar appearance and General had been Hedor&#x2019;s weapon. Gushantimur tried to tell him about Hedor but Tiyo refused.</span></p><p><span>Now he had the goal to get rid of the crazy chieftain with Crockta. If he found out about his father, his goal might become clouded.&#xA0;</span><span>After killing the great chieftain, Tiyo would return to this place and listen to Gushantimur&#x2019;s words about his father. It was also a pledge to come back here. Gushantimur respected his opinion.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;But I will ask one thing </span><i><span>dot</span></i><span>.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span><span>Tiyo&#x2019;s face was determined.&#xA0;</span><span>&quot;Is my father alive?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Gushantimur looked quietly at Tiyo and nodded.&#xA0;</span><span>&#x201C;He is.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;That is enough. The rest will be told at the next opportunity.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span><span>Tiyo turned away. Kiao clapped behind him.</span></p><p><span>Gushantimur&#x2019;s gaze focused on Crockta.&#xA0;</span><span>&#x201C;You are going to the Temple of the Fallen God.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Yes.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;That&apos;s right. There...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Gushantimur was still expressionless, but there was something in his eyes.&#xA0;</span><span>He seemed to become lost in memories whenever he talked about the Temple of the Fallen God. However, Crockta didn&#x2019;t ask about it.</span></p><p><span>&quot;When things are done, can we come back here?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Gushantimur nodded.&#xA0;</span><span>&quot;Of course. You are my friends.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Crockta felt his chest become hot.&#xA0;</span><span>Crockta extended his fist and touched it with Gushantimur&#x2019;s fist.. Gushantimur met that fist.</span></p><p><span>&quot;Let&#x2019;s see each other again. Stay alive.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;You too.&quot;</span></p><p><span>It was a farewell.&#xA0;</span><span>The moment he was going to turn around,</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;......&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Then someone spoke.&#xA0;</span><span>Crockta looked towards the source of the sound.&#xA0;</span><span>It was his waist.</span></p><p><span>The demon&#x2019;s skull with steel teeth at his waist, the Demon&#x2019;s Mouth.&#xA0;</span><span>At the moment, it spoke.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;What did you say?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>He couldn&#x2019;t hear because it was a small sound. Crockta touched the belt. But it didn&#x2019;t say anything else. It looked like a normal steel belt like it had gone back to sleep.</span></p><p><span>&quot;This guy&#x2019;s situation...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>It was the moment he turned to explain to Gushantimur,</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;......!&#x201D;&#xA0;</span><span>Gushantimur was watching Crockta with a surprised face.</span></p><p><span>And...</span></p><p><span>A flower bloomed.&#xA0;</span><span>There was a faint smile on his face.&#xA0;</span><span>The thin corners of his mouth covered in a bright smile for a short time.&#xA0;</span><span>It was a beautiful expression on Gushantimur that Crockta had never seen before.&#xA0;</span><span>His eyes were filled with laughter.</span></p><p><span>&quot;It was like that.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Gushantimur kept the bright smile as he said to Crockta, &#x201C;I&#x2019;ll be waiting for the day that we meet again.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Crockta didn&#x2019;t ask any more as he nodded with a smile.</span></p><p></p><p style="text-align: center"><span>***</span></p><p></p><p><span>They left the Black Forest and headed to Nameragon.</span></p><p><span>&quot;Crockta, perhaps you&#x2019;ve fallen </span><i><span>dot</span></i><span>.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;What do you mean?&quot;</span></p><p><span>&quot;You looked stunned at Gushantimur&#x2019;s smile</span><i><span> dot.</span></i><span>&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Ah, no. I never...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Hihihit, I didn&#x2019;t know that Crockta&#x2019;s taste was like that.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Crockta shook his head.</span></p><p><span>&quot;What are you talking about? I am a heterosexual person who likes women.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Why does that matter </span><i><span>dot</span></i><span>?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;......?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Anor started laughing.&#xA0;</span><span>&#x201C;Crockta doesn&#x2019;t seem to know about dragons.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Too ignorant </span><i><span>dot</span></i><span>!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Crockta frowned and said, &quot;I don&#x2019;t know what you are talking about.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Tiyo climbed Crockta&#x2019;s body and rode him like a horse. &#xA0;</span><span>He stared at Nameragon in the distance and said, &#x201C;Dragons have no gender </span><i><span>dot</span></i><span>. Wow, Nameragon is a big city.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;What?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Was there no gender, or were they a hermaphrodite?</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Nameragon is big. There are many people </span><i><span>dot</span></i><span>.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;The thing before that...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Ah, a dragon can be a man or a woman whenever necessary. Didn&#x2019;t you know? The next time you meet, Gushantimur might be a wonderful woman, hihihit.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;What, is this a scandal? Love between a dragon and orc? Ahh, good. Hahahat!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Tiyo and Anor laughed at him. Crockta shook his head.&#xA0;</span><span>It was clear that Anor was taking after the wrong role model.</span></p><p><span>&quot;We are almost there.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Crockta ignored them and identified Nameragon in the distance. It was still far away so he couldn&#x2019;t see it clearly.&#xA0;</span><span>He used Heart and Soul Penetration. Not only did it have the ability to see through the enemy, but it also improved his eyesight.</span></p><p><span>Wait.&#xA0;</span><span>That reminded him, he got a new skill.</span></p><p><span>[Status Window]</span></p><p><span>&#x2018;One who wants to become a hero&#x2019; Crockta, Orc Warrior.</span></p><p><span>Level: 65</span></p><p><span>Achievement Points: 545400</span></p><p><span>Assimilation: 86%</span></p><p><span>Abilities: </span></p><p><span>Peerless Mountain Seizing Strength (Pinnacle)</span></p><p><span>Regeneration Authority (Pinnacle)</span></p><p><span>Leyteno&#x2019;s Heart Swordsmanship (Pinnacle)</span></p><p><span>Extreme Fighting Spirit (Pinnacle)</span></p><p><span>Heart and Soul Penetration (Pinnacle)</span></p><p><span>Tattoos of War, Honour and Fighting Spirit (Pinnacle)</span></p><p><span>Army Crushing Roar of Madness (Pinnacle)</span></p><p><span>Creatures Butcher (Essence)</span></p><p><span>Unknown Mysterious Skill Before Use (???)]</span></p><p><span>His new title &#x2018;One who wants to become a hero&#x2019; was quite similar to the previous &#x2018;Person Pursuing the Pinnacle.&#x2019; His skill experience would be accelerated until he reached the Hero rank. Since Pinnacle rank required more enlightenment than proficiency, it involved Crockta&#x2019;s proficiency and enlightenment.</span></p><p><span>His level and achievement points had risen significantly. His ranking would also rise.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>Lastly, there was the mysterious skill that he wouldn&#x2019;t know what it was until he used it.&#xA0;</span><span>It really was a mystery.</span></p><p><span>Crockta stopped trying to use it.&#xA0;</span><span>If the skill caused an explosion, there was a chance that Tiyo and Anor might get hurt.&#xA0;</span><span>Or maybe it was something like a huge blade storm that would sweep around him and create a huge crater.&#xA0;</span><span>Maybe a meteor would fall from the sky and cause an area of death.&#xA0;</span><span>Or like a cartoon, his hair would turn blonde and his whole body would power up.</span></p><p><span>&quot;It is very difficult... Kulkulkul.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>That&#x2019;s right.&#xA0;</span><span>Crockta was filled with great anticipation.</span></p><p><span>Big expectations might lead to greater disappointment, but Crockta&#x2019;s chest was burning at the thought of the skill. Moreover, it was a skill he got from a dragon. There was no doubt that the skill would match the fury of a dragon.</span></p><p><span>&quot;Your expression is sneaky Crockta. What are you thinking... perhaps...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Nothing.&quot;&#xA0;</span><span>Crockta held out his hand.</span></p><p><span>&quot;Hmm, it is suspicious.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Tiyo got down from Crockta&#x2019;s neck.</span></p><p><span>&quot;Anyway, Nameragon is right in front of us! I&apos;m running </span><i><span>dot</span></i><span>! Let&#x2019;s go Anor!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>He started running towards Nameragon. Anor followed with the agile movements of a dark elf.&#xA0;</span><span>Crockta was left alone.&#xA0;</span><span>Crockta hesitated as he looked at the status window before using the skill.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Unknown Mysterious Skill Before Use, activate!&#x201D;</span></p><p></p><p style="text-align: center"><span>***</span></p><p></p><p><span>&quot;Crockta, why are you so slow </span><i><span>dot</span></i><span>?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;No reason.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Crockta&#x2019;s face was strangely dark as he followed. Tiyo was confused.</span></p><p><span>&quot;Do you not want to get further away from Gushantimur? Look...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Crockta picked up a stone and threw it. Tiyo agilely avoided it.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Hu, huhut! So sensitive </span><i><span>dot</span></i><span>!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Don&#x2019;t push him too hard. Doesn&#x2019;t Crockta need time to realize his feelings? Hahahahat.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>This guy Anor, he really knew how to trigger a person&#x2019;s anger.&#xA0;</span><span>After Tiyo, he threw a stone towards Anor. Anor screamed and ran away.</span></p><p><span>They arrived at the entrance of Nameragon.&#xA0;</span><span>It was lacking compared to the continent, but the size was similar to Arnin that Crockta visited in the past.&#xA0;</span><span>The moment they stood in front of the gate, dozens of bows aimed at them from the wall.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;......!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Crockta grabbed the handle of his greatsword. Tiyo raised General.&#xA0;</span><span>Anor hid behind Crockta.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Who are you?&#x201D;&#xA0;</span><span>A dark elf on top of the gate said. He was dressed similar to the other dark elves on the wall, but a red cloak was wrapped around him.&#xA0;</span><span>&#x201C;Orc, gnome. And a half breed with his ears cut. What a bizarre combination.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Crockta&#x2019;s eyes narrowed.&#xA0;</span><span>Then he politely said.</span></p><p><span>&quot;We have come to seek Nameragon&#x2019;s cooperation. I was recognized by the leaders of Orcheim, Dejame, and Altanas in the Luklan Mountains, as well as Nadia of Nuridot. My name is Crockta.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Ahh. Those guys.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span><span>The dark elf placed a foot on the railing of the wall.&#xA0;</span><span>&quot;I heard that a trio was playing as a group of heroes in the north.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>It was an obvious taunt.&#xA0;</span><span>Crockta realized that talking wouldn&#x2019;t change the outcome.&#xA0;</span><span>He wasn&#x2019;t a person who would bow down in this type of situation.</span></p><p><span>&quot;It will be difficult if you want to get our permission.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;The conditions?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Hrmm... perhaps if you cut the necks of 50 of your kin? Or give me a box of gold. That much is needed for an orc to enter Nameragon.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;It is too much.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;It is reasonable, not too much...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Crockta pulled out his greatsword before the elf finished speaking.&#xA0;</span><span>&quot;Don&apos;t misunderstand.&quot;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Pulling your sword in front of us, are you crazy?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Listen up.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>A huge momentum came from Crockta&#x2019;s body. The gate in front of him was big and thick. It was something that most people wouldn&#x2019;t even think about breaking through.&#xA0;</span><span>But he was different.</span></p><p><span>The world slowed down.&#xA0;</span><span>It was the world of the Pinnacle that he could freely enter after training with Gushantimur.&#xA0;</span><span>In the world of the Pinnacle, the gate was just a piece of wood.</span></p><p><span>Crockta&#x2019;s vision was different now.&#xA0;</span><span>&#x201C;I might not be allowed in here, but I am being polite and understanding.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Crockta&#x2019;s greatsword crossed the space.&#xA0;</span><span>A tremendous amount of power poured from Ogre Slayer. It crossed the space and slammed against the gate.</span></p><p><i><span>Kwa kwa kwa kwa!</span></i></p><p><span>A large crack was formed on the ground between Crockta and the gate.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;What?&#x201D;&#xA0;</span><span>The dark elf yelled with surprise.</span></p><p><span>The gate collapsed.&#xA0;</span><span>Beyond the ruined gate, the landscape of Nameragon could be seen. It was moderately developed. The dark elves passing by stared at him in astonishment.&#xA0;</span><span>Crockta told the dark elves above the gates.</span></p><p><span>&quot;We can enter Nameragon whenever we want. Please know that.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;......!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;I won&#x2019;t enter out of consideration for you.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>The dark elves who witnessed Crockta&#x2019;s action couldn&#x2019;t say anything.&#xA0;</span><span>Then the one in charge opened his mouth again.</span></p><p><span>&quot;You, doing this, you&#x2019;ve become our enemy...!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>But Crockta just turned around.&#xA0;</span><span>&#x201C;Let&#x2019;s go.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Crockta turned his back to Nameragon without any fear. Tiyo asked.</span></p><p><span>&quot;It is okay </span><i><span>dot</span></i><span>? The Temple of the Fallen God is beyond there.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;It&#x2019;s okay.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>The dark elves were rushing around behind him, but Crockta didn&#x2019;t care.</span></p><p><span>&quot;They will need us in a few days.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;What are you saying</span><i><span> dot</span></i><span>?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Crockta recalled what he saw before.</span></p><p><span>Two days. Two days. Two days. Two days. Two days. Two days. Two days. All of them, two days.</span></p><p><span>That was their remaining lifespan.</span></p><p><span>[The Gray God&#x2019;s Eyes (Outside the Ratings), it is a skill outside the ratings that has the power of a god.
