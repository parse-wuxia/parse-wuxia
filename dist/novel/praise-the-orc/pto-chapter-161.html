<p><span>Chapter 161 - Empire&#x2019;s Public Enemy (2)</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p><p><span>Crockta was waiting for the emperor&#x2019;s army in the vicinity of Nataliya Forest.&#xA0;</span><span>He couldn&#x2019;t deal with a large army alone, so he chose the forest.</span></p><p><span>He would do guerrilla warfare.&#xA0;</span><span>If the field of view was limited and wild beasts were present, he was confident that he could face the enemies.&#xA0;</span><span>Of course, it was on the premise that there weren&#x2019;t any people like Adandator present.</span></p><p><span>Crockta held his greatsword as he recalled the duel with Adandator.&#xA0;</span><span>It was a good test. Crockta was able to see that Adandator&#x2019;s swordsmanship was the result of patience and hard work.&#xA0;</span><span>All the movements were repeated and his swords worn out. It was an extreme obsession.</span></p><p><span>Crockta was reminded of Hoyt when he saw Adandator. He had some resemblance to Hoyt, who repeated the movements hundreds of thousands of times.&#xA0;</span><span>If there were more knights like Adandator, this fight would be dangerous.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Bul&#x2019;tar!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>A blow to the air. There was a shallow scratch on the tree.&#xA0;</span><span>Crockta wielded his sword like crazy. Every time he wielded it, the blade tore at the tree. But despite his violent movements, the trees only received a few minor injuries.</span></p><p><span>It was extreme control.&#xA0;</span><span>He only touched the tree with the tip of his sword before releasing it.</span></p><p><span>He dropped the sword.</span></p><p><span>Crockta took a deep breath.&#xA0;</span><span>He looked up at the sky.&#xA0;</span><span>In the thick forest that covered the sky, a few crows looked down at him and cried out.</span></p><p><span>&quot;A crow is auspicious, but it is also a disaster.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>In South Korea, the crying of a crow was a bad omen, but it was auspicious in the west.&#xA0;</span><span>If so, what about the guest who had just come?</span></p><p><span>Crockta turned around.&#xA0;</span><span>It was a guest he hadn&#x2019;t expected. Crockta raised his hand towards the person riding towards him.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;It has been a while.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>A man holding a sword.&#xA0;</span><span>Adandator.&#xA0;</span><span>He wasn&#x2019;t dressed as a knight.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Have you been well? Orc.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;I am Crockta. Human.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Crockta laughed.&#xA0;</span><span>Although he won, Adandator was certainly powerful. They knew each other&#x2019;s level, so there was an unknown bond between them.&#xA0;</span><span>There was respect, despite the fact that they might kill each other.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Why did you come? I thought you just followed the Emperor.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;The emperor doesn&#x2019;t have anything to do with me.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span><span>Adandator dragged the baggage he was carrying on his back.&#xA0;</span><span>&#x201C;I came because I have a request.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;A request?&quot;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Yes. A request.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span><span>He approached Crockta.&#xA0;</span><span>&quot;Tell me about your sword.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Crockta looked at Adandator.&#xA0;</span><span>It was an intense gaze. Adandator came here because of the light that appeared when he was defeated.</span></p><p><span>Crockta formed a fist.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Keok!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Adandator flew a short distance before hitting a tree and falling to the ground.&#xA0;</span><span>He was stunned by the impact.</span></p><p><span>Crockta approached.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Kuk...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;I don&apos;t believe those who break their oaths.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Crockta placed his foot on Adandator&#x2019;s body. Then he used his strength.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Cough...!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Get lost.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Crockta spat out.</span></p><p><span>Their duel was definitely a fight for Alaste&#x2019;s freedom. Crockta won.&#xA0;</span><span>However, Alaste was devastated.&#xA0;</span><span>Then Crockta decided to destroy the empire.&#xA0;</span><span>Crockta gradually increased his weight. Adandator was unable to withstand it and started trembling.</span></p><p><span>However, he looked up at Crockta and smiled.&#xA0;</span><span>&quot;I guess, cough, you are angry.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Of course.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;I will let you know. All the nobles opposed the invasion of Alaste.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Crockta&#x2019;s eyes narrowed.&#xA0;</span><span>&#x201C;So?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;I did as well.&quot;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Then why didn&#x2019;t you stop it?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;The emperor arbitrarily sent his troops. Those who were cursed by the stars.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;......&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Then I came to realize. The empire is galloping. It is a horse that can no longer be stopped. I can&#x2019;t stop the emperor&#x2019;s decisions.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span><span>Crockta removed his foot from Adandator. He barely managed to get up.&#xA0;</span><span>&#x201C;Cough, the empire and the emperor have nothing to do with why I&#x2019;m here. I want to know about your sword.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Crockta turned around.&#xA0;</span><span>&quot;I don&#x2019;t believe you.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;I will give you information.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span><span>Adandator shouted.&#xA0;</span><span>&quot;I&#x2019;ll tell you about the empire. It is necessary if you want to fight the emperor.&quot;</span></p><p><span>Crockta turned to him.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;......&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Are you interested now?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Why are you going so far?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Didn&apos;t I already say it? I want to know about your sword.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;That&#x2019;s it?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;That&apos;s it.&quot;&#xA0;</span><span>Adandator took out a sword.&#xA0;</span><span>&#x201C;That is all. Since you and I fought, I can barely hold my sword. When I raise the sword, you appear and block me. I&#x2019;m going crazy. Give me the answer.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;That is your reason.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;What other reason is needed? I am sincere right now.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Crockta laughed.</span></p><p><span>He was a stupid guy.&#xA0;</span><span>Crockta was sometimes curious about the person called the empire&#x2019;s best talent. He wanted to know how Adandator became so strong.&#xA0;</span><span>Crockta realized something. Adandator wasn&#x2019;t that mysterious or great.</span></p><p><span>He was just obsessed.&#xA0;</span><span>If he didn&#x2019;t get what he wanted, he wouldn&#x2019;t be able to breathe until he got it.&#xA0;</span><span>And this guy only wanted the sword.</span></p><p><span>&quot;Are there any knights in the empire as strong as you?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;No. Earl Bendeker is retired. The rest aren&#x2019;t at my standard. Some knight leaders have reached the Pinnacle but not beyond that.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Crockta raised his greatsword.</span></p><p><span>&quot;What does the emperor want? A species war?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;I don&#x2019;t know. There isn&#x2019;t enough interview.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>The bushes would constrain his movements.&#xA0;</span><span>It was an unfavorable battlefield for Crockta since he used a greatsword. However, he didn&#x2019;t care. Those who failed to kill the opponent were dead warriors.&#xA0;</span><span>They wouldn&#x2019;t always fight in an open environment that was favorable to them.</span></p><p><span>Crockta swung his greatsword first. Adandator promptly responded. The two blades hit each other.</span></p><p><span>&quot;What is the Heaven and Earth Clan&#x2019;s position in the empire?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Those who were cursed by the stars.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Their swords collided.&#xA0;</span><span>Gradually, their attacks reached the area of the Pinnacle. In the tranquil forest, the two of them moved quickly.&#xA0;</span><span>Crockta&#x2019;s sword smashed the forest while aiming at Adandator&#x2019;s body. Adandator desperately defended.</span></p><p><span>&quot;Are you going to just defend?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;......&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Adandator was unable to attack.&#xA0;</span><span>It was the same as when he was handling a sword alone. Crockta kept blocking him.&#xA0;</span><span>He couldn&#x2019;t attack.</span></p><p><span>&quot;...They came up under the sponsorship of Duke Christian and now they are by the emperor&#x2019;s side. Rommel is excellent at commanding in battle. I have to admit it.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;How so?&quot;</span></p><p><span>&quot;He turns fools into trained soldiers.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;......&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;I have never seen such a commander. While he did go through a few wars in the past, his abilities are still amazing nonetheless.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Crockta nodded.&#xA0;</span><span>It was thanks to the War Maestro class.&#xA0;</span><span>As far as he knew from the broadcasts and media, Choi Hansung had the skills to strengthen the soldiers, control them and eliminate any fear of war.</span></p><p><span>&quot;This time, the emperor even gave him a troop of knights. Be careful.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;I see.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Well-trained knights would bring tremendous synergy to Rommel.</span></p><p><span>Crockta once again pushed Adandator back.&#xA0;</span><span>Adandator was perplexed.&#xA0;</span><span>He thought he would be okay if he met Crockta in person and swung the sword. However, it wasn&#x2019;t the case. He could only act passively.&#xA0;</span><span>He didn&#x2019;t dare swing his sword at Crockta, as it felt like he was facing a dead end wall.</span></p><p><span>Adandator laughed.&#xA0;</span><span>&#x201C;...Have you become stronger?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;A little.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>After beating Adandator, Crockta had more experience with the Hero realm.&#xA0;</span><span>His overall abilities had increased since then, so he was able to deal with Adandator much easier.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;......&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Adandator grit his teeth.&#xA0;</span><span>It would be the same in the future.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Show me.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span><span>Adandator raised his sword and declared, &quot;Crockta, I can wield my sword after facing you. Even now I can&#x2019;t swing my sword. That light, what on earth is it?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;That...&#x201D;&#xA0;</span><span>Crockta puffed up his chest and shamelessly stated, &#x201C;I don&#x2019;t know.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;......!&quot;</span></p><p><span>&quot;It just happened. I can&#x2019;t do it again.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>That&#x2019;s right.&#xA0;</span><span>Since then, Crockta couldn&#x2019;t use that power again. It was a realm that he only glimpsed for a moment.</span></p><p><span>&quot;What?&quot;&#xA0;</span><span>Adandator was dumbfounded.&#xA0;</span><span>&#x201C;Really?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Really.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;......&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Adandator&#x2019;s face distorted.</span></p><p><span>&quot;Only...I was defeated by a technique you accidentally used?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;That&#x2019;s right. Defeated.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;That...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>His first official defeat in front of everyone.&#xA0;</span><span>He had lost when it was a significant battle for the empire.&#xA0;</span><span>However, it was just a coincidence.&#xA0;</span><span>It wasn&#x2019;t Crockta&#x2019;s real ability.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Huhuhu...&#x201D;&#xA0;</span><span>Adandator laughed and raised his sword before suddenly rushing forward.&#xA0;</span><span>&quot;This fucking orc bastard!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Opportunist bastard, you reveal your true nature.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span><span>Crockta raised his sword and declared, &quot;I tested you once in order to understand you.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;......!&quot;</span></p><p><span>&quot;I can actually use it.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Adandator stopped his sword.&#xA0;</span><span>&#x201C;R-Really?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;That&#x2019;s right.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;......&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Adandator coughed, &quot;I reacted too early. I will apologize. It was only once...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>At that moment, Crockta&#x2019;s fist hit his abdomen.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Cough!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Trying to cheat again? You are naive.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Y-You jerk...!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;I was lying. &#xA0;But even without it, you are below me, Adandator.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Bastard!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Adandator threw down his sword and ran at Crockta, who also abandoned his weapon.&#xA0;</span><span>Adandator threw his body at Crockta.&#xA0;</span><span>The two opponents dumped their swords and continued to struggle for awhile. Their fists hit each other&#x2019;s faces.</span></p><p><span>It was an unsightly dog fight between the empire&#x2019;s strongest knight and the orc warrior who defeated him.</span></p><p><span>&quot;Wait a minute, wait a minute!&quot;&#xA0;</span><span>Crockta was on top of him and Adandator shook his head.&#xA0;</span><span>&#x201C;Wait a minute!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;What?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Crockta paused his fist and looked down.&#xA0;</span><span>Adandator was holding both hands together.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;I lost.&#x201D;</span><span>&#x201D;.......&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Don&#x2019;t hit my face. I surrender.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Crockta grinned.&#xA0;</span><span>&quot;It is good that you can admit it.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>He got up.&#xA0;</span><span>At that moment, Adandator grabbed some dirt on the ground and threw it into Crockta&#x2019;s face.</span></p><p><span>&quot;......!&quot;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;You were tricked!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Crockta rubbed his eyes as Adandator threw his battered body forward.&#xA0;</span><span>It was a big size difference, but Adandator was able to build up a lot of strength over the past few years.&#xA0;</span><span>His fists relentlessly hit Crockta.</span></p><p><span>&quot;Cough! C-Coward...!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;It isn&#x2019;t like that!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>These types of techniques were also required in knight training. Adandator was good in boxing techniques.&#xA0;</span><span>He threw out a jab and once Crockta protected his face, he hit Crockta&#x2019;s forehead with a wind hook fist.</span></p><p><i><span>Papak!</span></i></p><p><span>Crockta&#x2019;s body shook.</span></p><p><span>&quot;It is the end...!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>The moment he was going to kick Crockta&#x2019;s chin...</span></p><p><span>Crockta disappeared.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;What...?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>His body had bent down.&#xA0;</span><span>Then Crockta picked up Adandator&#x2019;s body.</span></p><p><span>&quot;Wait a minute, wait a minute, that is cheating...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Were there any rules in this fight?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;It is supposed to be bare fists. I will die. That is a rock.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Crockta&#x2019;s body shook.&#xA0;</span><span>He was laughing.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Huhuhuhu...&#x201D;&#xA0;</span><span>Crockta told him.&#xA0;</span><span>&#x201C;Then die.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>He leaned forward.&#xA0;</span><span>Adandator screamed as he headed towards the ground.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Kyaaaack!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>His head was about to hit the ground.&#xA0;</span><span>Just before his skull collapsed, his body stopped moving.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;......&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Crockta had stopped just before Adandator would be killed. Crockta lifted him again and placed him safely on the floor.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;......&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Adandator was speechless.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Hey, is it that scary? Did you pee?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;......&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Hey?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Crockta called out to him.</span></p><p><span>Adandator.&#xA0;</span><span>He was teary-eyed.</span></p><p><span>&quot;......!&quot;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;You...bastard orc...!&#x201D;&#xA0;</span><span>Adandator swung his fist. Of course, the target was Crockta.&#xA0;</span><span>&quot;That isn&#x2019;t true, you bastard...!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Are you a crybaby? Haha.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;I will kill you!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Yes yes, a crybaby.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;You son of a bitch!&#x201D;&#xA0;</span><span>Adandator grabbed his sword on the ground and swung it at Crockta.&#xA0;</span><span>&quot;Ahhhhhhh!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>He reached the realm of Hero in an instant and attacked Crockta.&#xA0;</span><span>Crockta also used the Hero realm to deal with the attack.&#xA0;</span><span>The tentacles of causality tangled together. But in the end, Adandator was pushed back.&#xA0;</span><span>Crockta was more experienced with the Hero realm and Adandator, who had fallen into a slump, was unable to narrow that gap.</span></p><p><span>Crockta looked down at him and said,&#xA0;</span><span>&#x201C;Hey.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;This bastard...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;How is it? Can you now wield the sword against me?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;......!&quot;</span></p><p><span>Adandator&#x2019;s eyes widened.</span></p><p><span>Crockta grinned.&#xA0;</span><span>&quot;That light, you will know what it is if you keep training. You were just afraid.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Nonsense...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;We are creatures who like using our fists and stumble when the temple is hit. Don&#x2019;t choke.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Talking nonsense...&#x201D;&#xA0;</span><span>Adandator covered his eyes and laughed.&#xA0;</span><span>&quot;Orc bastard who is good at lying, talking nonsense...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;This is the end.&quot;</span></p><p><span>Crockta sprinkled dirt from the floor on Adandator&#x2019;s face. Adandator spat out the dirt and cursed.&#xA0;</span><span>Crockta burst out laughing.</span></p><p><span>The &#x2018;He&#x2019;s an Orc, yet still Praiseworthy&#x2019; members returned to the forest.&#xA0;</span><span>They found a laughing Crockta and a man lying on the floor.</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p><p><a href="www.wuxiaworld.com">Glossary of Common Korean Terms.</a></p><p>Praise the Orc:&#xA0;<a href="docs.google.com">Glossary Link.&#xA0;</a></p><p>Current schedule:&#xA0;There will now be 14 chapters a week, meaning two chapters every day.</p><p>I have also updated my&#xA0;<a href="www.patreon.com">Patreon</a>&#xA0;to reflect my new novels.
