<p><span>Chapter 150 - Evil Empire</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p><p><span>The two sides confronted each other on the plains.&#xA0;</span><span>The kingdom&#x2019;s and Alaste&#x2019;s flags danced in the wind.&#xA0;</span><span>The king and the lord of Alaste headed towards each other on horseback.</span></p><p><span>&quot;It is great to see you.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;It has been a while, Earl Alaste.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>The king was a young man, the epitome of a noble with blonde hair and observant, blue eyes.&#xA0;</span><span>Of course, he was more than a mere noble. He was the king who would soon stand at the top.</span></p><p><span>&quot;It&apos;s a good day. I will cleanly accept the result today. In the name of the gods.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Yes. I will as well. I hope Your Highness keeps the words you said beforehand.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>The king&#x2019;s eyes narrowed. Earl Alaste&#x2019;s expression didn&#x2019;t change.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>The king asked, &#x201C;You seem to have confidence. How is Galadin?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;He&#x2019;s as upright as always. Do you want to see him?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;It&#x2019;s okay. It is enough to see you instead of that old man&#x2019;s face.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Both of them didn&#x2019;t avoid the other&#x2019;s eyes.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;...Okay.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>The king&#x2019;s lips twisted before he smiled and said, &quot;Once the sun comes up to the middle, the duel will start. I&#x2019;ll tell Adandator to control his strength in consideration for Galadin&#x2019;s old age.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Thank you for your words. Just...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Just?&quot;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Galadin won&#x2019;t be fighting today.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;What?&quot;&#xA0;</span><span>The king gazed at the lord with a suspicious expression.&#xA0;</span><span>&quot;Then who will come out?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;You will see when the sun rises to the middle.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;......&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>The king&#x2019;s face twisted at the lord&#x2019;s relaxed attitude.&#xA0;</span><span>He was dissatisfied with the lord&#x2019;s relaxed attitude and confused about the unknown warrior.&#xA0;</span><span>He spat out in a rough voice, &#x201C;Yes, I&#x2019;ll see soon.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>They turned around and returned to their camps.&#xA0;</span><span>Lord Alaste immediately sought out Crockta who was in a tent at the rear of the camp. His face was stiff with tension.&#xA0;</span><span>However, he couldn&#x2019;t help smiling at the sight within the tent.</span></p><p><span>Crockta was lying on a bed and humming, while Vigo was sitting next to the bed and fanning Crockta.</span></p><p><span>&quot;Are you cool?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Harder.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Hiyah!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Do it properly. You will be responsible if my condition isn&#x2019;t good.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;No! Brother!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;A knight should have a better wrist snap.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>He didn&#x2019;t seem like a warrior who had the fate of the city on his shoulders. That made him seem more reliable.&#xA0;</span><span>This was none other than Northern Conqueror Crockta. He would clearly be able to cope with Adandator.</span></p><p><span>Even Galadin acknowledged that Crockta was stronger than him. The lord decided to give up worrying.&#xA0;</span><span>It had already left his hands. He had dealt the best hand he could.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Vigo.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Yes, Lord!&quot;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Fan him properly. The future of Alaste hangs on your fan.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Cough! Yes!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Tiyo and Anor came together and weren&#x2019;t worried at all. They were dozing in a corner of the tent. They had drunk alcohol all night.&#xA0;</span><span>They were friends who had no tension at all.</span></p><p><span>&quot;Crockta, I want to thank you once again. Thank you for your willingness to go to such a dangerous place.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Kulkulkul. There is no need for thanks, I am just doing the work of a warrior.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span><span>Crockta leisurely stretched while enjoying the breeze from the fan.&#xA0;</span><span>&quot;So when is the duel?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Noon.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Crockta looked at the sky through the open gap in the tent.&#xA0;</span><span>It was pretty soon.</span></p><p></p><p style="text-align: center"><span>***</span></p><p></p><p><span>Trumpets sounded.&#xA0;</span><span>Both sides were nervous.&#xA0;</span><span>The sun had risen above their heads. Now the duel would begin.&#xA0;</span><span>It was a fight to determine the future of each side. So many things were involved.</span></p><p><span>Adandator appeared first.&#xA0;</span><span>The king placed a hand on his shoulder and spoke to him. Adandator answered in a short manner.</span></p><p><span>&quot;It is lively.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Adandator was a beautiful young man. His body was well balanced.&#xA0;</span><span>He was still young, but he was a seasoned knight who had gone through many battles.</span></p><p><span>Then it was time for Alaste&#x2019;s representative to come out.&#xA0;</span><span>Crockta walked forward.</span></p><p><span>&quot;......!&quot;</span></p><p><span>The kingdom&#x2019;s side was shaken and murmurs gradually spread.&#xA0;</span><span>They all expected the warrior for Alaste to be Galadin.&#xA0;</span><span>It was common knowledge that the best knight in Alaste was Galadin, and there was no stronger knight.&#xA0;</span><span>The kingdom was convinced of their victory because Galadin was too old compared to Adandator.</span></p><p><span>However, a surprising figure appeared.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>An orc.&#xA0;</span><span>A warrior with a heinous face and tattoos all over his body.&#xA0;</span><span>His enormous mass and greatsword could be seen clearly from afar.</span></p><p><span>Adandator looked at him curiously.&#xA0;</span><span>It wasn&#x2019;t a tense face. He thought it would be a tragic comedy.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;I am Adandator Paklinche. Who are you?&#x201D;&#xA0;</span><span>He was curious about the orc standing in front of him.&#xA0;</span><span>&quot;Are you really the representative of Alaste?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Crockta nodded.&#xA0;</span><span>The plains gradually became quiet.</span></p><p><span>Crockta smiled and looked at Adandator.&#xA0;</span><span>&#x201C;My name is Crockta. I came from Orcrox and stand here to guard Alaste.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;......!&quot;</span></p><p><span>Adandator&#x2019;s eyes widened.</span></p><p><span>Crockta.&#xA0;</span><span>He knew that name.&#xA0;</span><span>It was the unidentified orc who killed the great chieftain and blocked them before the call for the northern war began in earnest.&#xA0;</span><span>On that day, all the gods whispered to his name.</span></p><p><span>&quot;Alaste has prepared a hidden card.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>His expression recovered and he lifted his sword.&#xA0;</span><span>Adandator didn&#x2019;t use a greatsword like Crockta. It was a thin and long sword that looked elegant.&#xA0;</span><span>Both of them used Paklinche&#x2019;s swordsmanship, but they had different attitudes and atmosphere.</span></p><p><span>Crockta asked, &#x201C;Do you know Leyteno Paklinche?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Hoh?&#x201D;&#xA0;</span><span>Adandator laughed.&#xA0;</span><span>&quot;The traitor Leyteno. Orcs should know him. Yes, I know Leyteno. He is a coward on the side of the orcs. The traitor who turned his sword against us. That is why he is a blot to the rest of the Paklinche family. In the end, he died miserably.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;A coward. A traitor. A blot.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span><span>Crockta laughed out loud.</span></p><p><span>The Leyteno that Crockta heard about was absolutely not a coward.&#xA0;</span><span>He wasn&#x2019;t a traitor or a blot, but a shining star.&#xA0;</span><span>The hero who followed the path of his sword.&#xA0;</span><span>Everyone would&#x2019;ve blamed him. If Leyteno just closed his eyes and aimed his sword at the orcs, he could gain wealth and honor.</span></p><p><span>However, he gritted his teeth and did what he believed was right.&#xA0;</span><span>He wasn&#x2019;t a slave but his own master.&#xA0;</span><span>If he followed the same direction that all the other fingers were pointing, he was just a slave.</span></p><p><span>However, Leyteno shook his head and pointed to the other side alone.&#xA0;</span><span>He straightened up, pointed to his own beliefs and moved.&#xA0;</span><span>That was why he would stand forever in the Hall of Fame.&#xA0;</span><span>Leyteno Paklinche would never die.&#xA0;</span><span>None of the warriors in the Hall of Fame would die.</span></p><p><span>&quot;Right now, I will connect to Leyteno Paklinche&#x2019;s will.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Crockta raised his greatsword.&#xA0;</span><span>As Crockta reached a higher ground, he had gone beyond Leyteno&#x2019;s swordsmanship but it was still alive in Ogre Slayer.</span></p><p><span>&quot;Feel it yourself. Paklinche.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Show me your blade, Orc.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span><span>Adandator grinned.&#xA0;</span><span>&#x201C;You are ignorant. I can see an echo of the traitor. Okay, just once...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>At this moment, everyone on the plains was watching Crockta and Adandator.</span></p><p><span>&quot;Let&apos;s do it!&quot;</span></p><p><span>Adandator plunged in first.&#xA0;</span><span>Crockta watched him.&#xA0;</span><span>The world slowed.&#xA0;</span><span>Adandator&#x2019;s handsome face was shining with a mixture of arrogance and self-confidence. Crockta&#x2019;s greatsword swung towards his shining face.</span></p><p><i><span>Kaaaang!</span></i></p><p><span>Adandator was a genius and was waiting for Crockta in the realm of the Pinnacle.&#xA0;</span><span>The two blades met several times.&#xA0;</span><span>It was a battle that ordinary eyes couldn&#x2019;t follow.&#xA0;</span><span>They exchanged blows for a long time. As explosive sounds were heard from both sounds, small wounds appeared on their bodies.</span></p><p><span>Blood splattered on both their faces.</span></p><p><span>There would be cheers from both sides whenever dust rose as a result of the collision between swords.&#xA0;</span><span>It was a fight of absolute power that could rarely be seen!</span></p><p><span>At that moment, Crockta&#x2019;s battle cry shook the plains.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Bul&#x2019;tarrrrrrrrrr&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>It was like an earthquake occurred as the audience member&#x2019;s legs shook from the roar.&#xA0;</span><span>Adandator, who faced it directly, felt like his heart was going to stop.&#xA0;</span><span>Crockta&apos;s overwhelming presence was pouring toward him.&#xA0;</span><span>As his eyes flicked, the trajectory of the greatsword flying towards him changed in a subtle way.</span></p><p><span>Adandator tried to block it but was thrown back by a huge power.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Kuheeok!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>The moment of the attack, Crockta&#x2019;s fist struck Adandator&#x2019;s abdomen.&#xA0;</span><span>Adandator flew through the air and landed on the ground.&#xA0;</span><span>Crockta&apos;s powerful blow!</span></p><p><i><span>Waaaaaaaaaaaah!</span></i></p><p><span>Alaste&#x2019;s side cheered. On the other hand, the side of the kingdom became completely quiet.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;......&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Adandator stood up.&#xA0;</span><span>He shuddered from the impact as blood poured from his nose.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>Crockta laughed and raised his finger, signalling his opponent to quickly come at him.&#xA0;</span><span>&quot;Kulkul, are you okay?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;You aren&#x2019;t a mere child. I understand...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Adandator laughed. He spat out the blood in his mouth. Then he took a serious posture with his sword.&#xA0;</span><span>His body started to enter the Pinnacle. Over and over, he once again reached a high ground.&#xA0;</span><span>The world was still.</span></p><p><span>He jumped and brandished his sword at Crockta.&#xA0;</span><span>Crockta blocked it with Ogre Slayer.&#xA0;</span><span>However, his skin was torn and blood poured out. Crockta hurriedly stepped back.</span></p><p><span>&quot;......!&quot;</span></p><p><span>This time, it was the kingdom&#x2019;s side that cheered.&#xA0;</span><span>Adandator smiled and repeated Crockta&#x2019;s words, &quot;Are you okay?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Crockta responded with a smile, &quot;You also aren&#x2019;t a mere child.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Kilkilkil.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Crockta calmly raised Ogre Slayer.</span></p><p><span>Adandator was a genius.&#xA0;</span><span>He could believe that.&#xA0;</span><span>Adandator had surpassed the realm of the Pinnacle. It was the realm of the Hero that Crockta had learned while crossing life and death.&#xA0;</span><span>If so, Crockta should do the same thing.</span></p><p><span>The cheers and boos became mixed together. The sun was shining above their heads. Sweat was pouring down their cheeks as they recognized the weight of the weapons they held.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>A formidable opponent.&#xA0;</span><span>A high level of swordsmanship where anyone could win was implemented.&#xA0;</span><span>An interesting opponent.</span></p><p><span>They moved their bodies while thinking the same thing.&#xA0;</span><span>The strands of causality started to converge on both of them.&#xA0;</span><span>The strands of causality stretched out like tentacles towards each other.&#xA0;</span><span>One step, one stroke, a stepping motion, every time the blades moved, they aimed to create a life or death injury.</span></p><p><span>Indeed, Paklinche&#x2019;s blood was very deep.</span></p><p><span>&quot;I never thought you would follow this far...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Adandator was inwardly impatient.&#xA0;</span><span>He was convinced that he could win without fail if Galadin was his opponent.&#xA0;</span><span>But then this orc appeared instead of Galadin.&#xA0;</span><span>His instincts sent a warning. They were both on the same ground.&#xA0;</span><span>This orc had also surpassed the Pinnacle.</span></p><p><span>Maybe he would die today.&#xA0;</span><span>The chains of causality stretching from Crockta sought to swallow Adandator.</span></p><p><span>The sun was blazing above his head.&#xA0;</span><span>It was hot.&#xA0;</span><span>Adandator&#x2019;s eyes were dazzled. If he was careless, the orc would cause him to die under this sun.</span></p><p><span>In the infinitely slow world, Crockta and Adandator met each other. Sweat trickled down Adandator&#x2019;s face. But he never looked away.&#xA0;</span><span>Now the plains were still.&#xA0;</span><span>They felt that the fight had reached a realm that they didn&#x2019;t dare to evaluate.</span></p><p><span>The first one to move was Adandator.&#xA0;</span><span>He exploded his power in order to win the battle before it lengthened even further.&#xA0;</span><span>Pressure rose from his body.&#xA0;</span><span>His power reversed causation and rushed towards Crockta&#x2019;s death.</span></p><p><span>It was like a tsunami was heading towards Crockta.&#xA0;</span><span>Numerous blades were aiming at his neck.&#xA0;</span><span>Causality sped towards Crockta&#x2019;s death. Crockta aimed for Adandator&#x2019;s death and canceled out the attack.</span></p><p><span>Blood poured from wounds on his limbs.&#xA0;</span><span>The blades from Adandator inevitably fell towards Crockta from all angles.&#xA0;</span><span>They pierced his shoulders, sides, and thighs at the same time.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Ugh!&#x201D;&#xA0;</span><span>Crockta fell down.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Waaaaaaack!&#x201D;&#xA0;</span><span>Adandator didn&#x2019;t miss this gap and rushed forward. He wanted to finish this in one blow.</span></p><p><span>A huge wave pushed towards Crockta.&#xA0;</span><span>Death seemed unstoppable.&#xA0;</span><span>The handful of wind, bubbles, nail-sized mass and every other trivial thing could cause death.&#xA0;</span><span>Compared to that, the tool called a sword, which was made to kill others, was like a large army advancing towards death.</span></p><p><span>Dozens then hundreds of swords poured towards Crockta.&#xA0;</span><span>The probability of survival and probability of death were reversed.&#xA0;</span><span>Life itself led to death.&#xA0;</span><span>However.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Bul&#x2019;tar.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Crockta whispered.&#xA0;</span><span>As Adandator&#x2019;s tsunami of death flew towards him, he started weaving together the causation of the world.&#xA0;</span><span>It was risky.</span></p><p><span>This was the first time Crockta thought about death since the battle against the great chieftain.&#xA0;</span><span>He needed to risk everything to overcome Adandator&#x2019;s blow. Crockta held Ogre Slayer. He would fight back with his life on the line.</span></p><p><span>However, at that moment...</span></p><p><span>Crockta suddenly saw something.</span></p><p><span>&#x2018;I am alive.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span>He didn&#x2019;t know what it was.&#xA0;</span><span>However, Crockta instinctively leaned towards the line that was passing through the world.&#xA0;</span><span>It was a color that was hard to describe.&#xA0;</span><span>It was a color that didn&#x2019;t exist in the world.</span></p><p><span>That line penetrated both the visible world that people could see, the world of the Pinnacle and the world of the Hero that reversed causality.&#xA0;</span><span>Even death couldn&#x2019;t bear it.</span></p><p><span>&#x2018;Honor.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span>What was that line?&#xA0;</span><span>In addition, the color as well.&#xA0;</span><span>Why was it so radiant?&#xA0;</span><span>The moment that his body touched that line.&#xA0;</span><span>The whole world pushed Crockta&#x2019;s back.&#xA0;</span><span>It was a helping hand to raise all the sinking things.</span></p><p><span>Crockta rushed towards the infinitely unfolding tsunami of death. He flew towards the infinite expanse of the abyss.</span></p><p><span>Bul&#x2019;tarrrrrrrrrr&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;!</span></p><p><span>There was light.</span></p><p></p><p style="text-align: center"><span>***</span></p><p></p><p><span>It was a long fight.&#xA0;</span><span>Crockta and Adandator gradually entered a state of fighting that couldn&#x2019;t be understood.&#xA0;</span><span>Only a few senior ranking knights could feel the level.&#xA0;</span><span>The two repeated the gains and losses as they kept attacking each other. Blood sporadically splattered but they didn&#x2019;t back down.</span></p><p><span>The king stared blankly and inadvertently dropped his wine glass.&#xA0;</span><span>However, the king and his knights were conscious of the pieces of glass.&#xA0;</span><span>It might be a fight that they could never see again in their lives.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;I can&#x2019;t believe it...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>At that moment, Adandator rushed like crazy.&#xA0;</span><span>It was an attack on everything.&#xA0;</span><span>As if a storm was taking place around his body, countless attacks were launched.&#xA0;</span><span>Crockta blocked with his greatsword but fell down to one knee.</span></p><p><span>Adandator didn&#x2019;t miss this and chased him.&#xA0;</span><span>Everyone sensed that it was the final blow.&#xA0;</span><span>There was a black wave.</span></p><p><span>In that instance, the kingdom was convinced that Adandator had won.&#xA0;</span><span>It was a blow containing everything.&#xA0;</span><span>No one could survive that hit.</span></p><p><span>Then...</span></p><p><span>A bolt of light.&#xA0;</span><span>It was a very short moment.&#xA0;</span><span>Light enveloped the plains.&#xA0;</span><span>It was a color that had never been seen before. They didn&#x2019;t know what color it was. It destroyed Adandator&#x2019;s black wave.</span></p><p><span>&quot;......!&quot;</span></p><p><span>The light disappeared and dust rose up.&#xA0;</span><span>They could only see that Adandator&#x2019;s sword was broken and Crockta&#x2019;s Ogre Slayer was pointed at his neck.&#xA0;</span><span>Silence fell over the plains.&#xA0;</span><span>The winner and loser didn&#x2019;t move. There was silence. The clouds moving through the sky stopped.</span></p><p><span>Then a gnome standing on Alaste&#x2019;s side broke the silence.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Kahahahat! Victory <em>dot</em>!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>There was no tension in the voice.&#xA0;</span><span>Then Alaste&#x2019;s side understood the situation and started cheering. They threw their weapons and helmets and yelled.&#xA0;</span><span>Everyone embraced each other as they shouted.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Waaaaaaah!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;We won!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Hooray Alaste! Alaste!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Hooray Crockta!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Alaste! Alaste!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>The kingdom&#x2019;s side was silent.&#xA0;</span><span>The faces of the young king, his knights and the Heaven and Earth executives stiffened.&#xA0;</span><span>They hadn&#x2019;t expected Adandator to be defeated.&#xA0;</span><span>However, the orc Crockta had ruined their ambitions.</span></p><p><span>&quot;Dammit, that person...I knew it.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>The former master of Thawing Balhae and current vice master of Heaven and Earth, Keynes muttered.&#xA0;</span><span>That Crockta kept continuing to disturb him.&#xA0;</span><span>The guy who got rid of Thawing Balhae. Now he was chasing the Heaven and Earth Clan and hindering their work.&#xA0;</span><span>He gritted his teeth.&#xA0;</span><span>Somehow, he had to get rid of that orc.</span></p><p><span>Rommel kept silent with a stiff face.</span></p><p><span>Adandator dropped his weapon and declared his surrender, causing the duel to completely end.</span></p><p><span>The lord of Alaste approached the king.&#xA0;</span><span>Now that victory had been decided, the Alaste lord descended from his horse and bowed towards the king in a polite manner.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Please accept the result. Your Highness.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;......&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Instead of answering, the king quietly turned his head away.&#xA0;</span><span>The lord of Alaste smiled and stepped back. He felt very uncomfortable.&#xA0;</span><span>But it didn&#x2019;t matter now.&#xA0;</span><span>It was time to go back to Alaste and celebrate.</span></p><p></p><p style="text-align: center"><span>***</span></p><p></p><p><span>Alaste scheduled a city wide festival. The protagonist was Crockta.</span></p><p><span>Everyone praised him as the hero who saved Alaste.&#xA0;</span><span>Crockta&#x2019;s group traveled through the streets and shared food and alcohol with the citizens.&#xA0;</span><span>To the children, he wasn&#x2019;t an orc but an orc knight.&#xA0;</span><span>The children gathered every time he appeared. They were all calling Crockta&#x2019;s name.</span></p><p><span>There was a proposal to build a statue of Crockta in commemoration of today. All the sculptors in Alaste volunteered.&#xA0;</span><span>Crockta shook his head but was forced to accept their will.&#xA0;</span><span>His appearance, made of marble, was to remain in Alaste forever.</span></p><p><span>There were women confessing to Anor. Anor didn&#x2019;t avoid them, staring straight into their eyes as he politely refused.&#xA0;</span><span>They smiled and expressed their thanks for Anor&#x2019;s gentlemanly attitude.
