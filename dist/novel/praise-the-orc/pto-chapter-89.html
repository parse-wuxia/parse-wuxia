<p><span>Chapter 89 - The Black Forest (2)</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p><p><span>An unbelievable storm of light struck. At the center of the storm was a furious arrow.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Waaaaah!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Tiyo barely avoided the arrow but he fell into the forest in the aftermath of the storm. The whirlwind swept the spot where Tiyo had been standing.&#xA0;</span><span>Tiyo lay down in the collapsed wreckage of the forest.</span></p><p><span>Crockta and Anor froze.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Tiyo!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Tiyo was lying down like he was dead. His fingertips moved. His eyelids shook before he slowly opened his eyes. Tiyo staggered as he raised his body.&#xA0;</span><span>He was still holding onto General tightly.</span></p><p><span>&quot;Don&#x2019;t interfere </span><i><span>dot</span></i><span>...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Tiyo glared at the goblin. The goblin still had a relaxed expression on his face. Rather, this time he raised a hand like he was yielding.&#xA0;</span><span>It provoked Tiyo.</span></p><p><span>&quot;You might be confident but I am a gnome soldier from Quantes.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Tiyo aimed General&#x2019;s muzzle.</span></p><p><span>&quot;You will regret the day you upset me </span><i><span>dot</span></i><span>.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>But the goblin didn&#x2019;t care. He just laughed at Tiyo. The ridiculing smile of the goblin further stimulated Tiyo.&#xA0;</span><span>The goblin frowned and said to Tiyo.</span></p><p><span>&quot;Let&#x2019;s go, garrison gnome, I&#x2019;ll make you regret it kyak! Don&#x2019;t just talk with your mouth kyahahak!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;This bastard!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Tiyo rushed forward and fired General.&#xA0;</span><span>It was an assault meant to contain the enemy while he approached. But the goblin didn&#x2019;t allow him to get closer.&#xA0;</span><span>It was like teleportation as the goblin moved backward, sideways and even over some trees. Every time Tiyo&#x2019;s barrage stopped, the goblin fired an arrow.</span></p><p><span>Tiyo avoided any fatal shots but the arrows tore his skin. The number of wounds gradually increased.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Kuock...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Tiyo stared at the wound on his arm with wild eyes.</span></p><p><span>&quot;I have to acknowledge your confidence despite your lack of skills kyahahak!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;......!&quot;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Your shooting skills are the worst kyak!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Tiyo&#x2019;s hands shook.&#xA0;</span><span>He was the best shooter in Quantes. He had been recognized as the best every time he fired. Yet this goblin was hurting his pride.</span></p><p><span>Tiyo nodded.&#xA0;</span><span>&quot;Okay, Goblin.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>He moved his feet until they were shoulder width apart and stood firmly on the ground.</span></p><p><span>&quot;Let me give you a taste of my shooting </span><i><span>dot</span></i><span>.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;It is in vain kyak!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Tiyo&#x2019;s General aimed at the goblins. The goblin also aimed at Tiyo with his arrow.</span></p><p><span>&quot;Never interfere </span><i><span>dot</span></i><span>...!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>The situation had become worse than he thought so Crockta had tried to intervene with his greatsword. However, Tiyo had a determined expression on his face.&#xA0;</span><span>Crockta was forced to take a step back.</span></p><p><span>Suddenly, the wind blew.&#xA0;</span><span>The Black Forest shook.&#xA0;</span><span>The wind twisted the branches. The leaves fell to the floor.&#xA0;</span><span>The leaves fell down between Tiyo and the goblin.&#xA0;</span><span>Like a joke of fate, the leaves passed through the point where they were aiming.&#xA0;</span><span>The moment that their view of each other was blocked...</span></p><p><span>The arrows and bullets fired towards each other.</span></p><p><i><span>Susususuk.</span></i></p><p><i><span>Shyaaaaaah!</span></i></p><p><span>At the same time, the goblin and Tiyo&#x2019;s body twisted.&#xA0;</span><span>The arrow narrowly passed by Tiyo&#x2019;s cheek.&#xA0;</span><span>The magic bullet passed by the goblin&#x2019;s side and broke the tree.</span></p><p><span>&quot;......!&quot;</span></p><p><span>None of his bullets touched the goblin. The goblin laughed and did a thumbs down towards Tiyo.</span></p><p><span>&quot;This is the difference between you and me kyak.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>The goblin laughed.&#xA0;</span><span>At that moment.</span></p><p><i><span>Jeeeok.</span></i></p><p><span>The tree that Tiyo&#x2019;s magic bullet broke started to tilt slowly. The tree cast a shadow over the goblin. The goblin&#x2019;s face stiffened.</span></p><p><span>Tiyo said.&#xA0;</span><span>&quot;Goblin, you might have learned the official language but...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Tiyo imitated the goblin&#x2019;s actions by lowering his thumb.&#xA0;</span><span>At the same time, the tree slammed into the goblin.</span></p><p><span>&quot;It seems like you haven&#x2019;t learned physics </span><i><span>dot</span></i><span>.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>The goblin moaned as it was crushed by the tree.</span></p><p></p><p style="text-align: center"><span>***</span></p><p></p><p><span>They passed through the Black Forest and met many monsters.</span></p><p><span>There was an ogre who learned martial arts, the goblin archer was followed by a lich who summoned skeleton warriors, there was a troll that skillfully wielded a giant axe, a ninja direwolf who struck in the darkness and a lizardman who used a spear. They had to deal with all types of enemies.</span></p><p><span>All of them weren&#x2019;t ordinary monsters. They all had unique skills, like specialists pursuing their own roads.</span></p><p><span>&quot;The Black Forest is a really strange place...&#x201D; muttered Tiyo.</span></p><p><span> He had just knocked out a kobold archer.&#xA0;</span><span>The kobold was a bipedal creature with the head of a dog, and it hid in various parts of the forest and fired at them before hiding again. One would be okay, but there were many of them.</span></p><p><span>Tiyo used his sophisticated shooting to hit the real one and the illusions. In the end, the kobold had admitted defeat after being hit and collapsing.</span></p><p><span>&quot;Doesn&#x2019;t it seem like we&#x2019;re being tested </span><i><span>dot</span></i><span>?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>The level of the creatures kept increasing.</span></p><p><span>&quot;What type of hermit is living in a place like the Black Forest?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Be careful. It&#x2019;s time for new enemies to emerge.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Uhh...I&#x2019;m scared.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>They had walked for a long time after suppressing the kobold. According to the pattern, it was time for someone new to appear and stop them.&#xA0;</span><span>What type of enemy would it be this time?&#xA0;</span><span>They felt a mix of expectations and tiredness. They moved slowly through the forest.</span></p><p><span>An unfamiliar landscape appeared in front of them.</span></p><p><span>&quot;You came up to here.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>A young man was sitting in a rocking chair and reading a book. He glanced at Crockta&#x2019;s party over his spectacles. It was a young man with pitch black hair.</span></p><p><span>&quot;It has been a long time since I&#x2019;ve had visitors.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>At first, his appearance looked like an elf, but this man had a face that was a level higher than that. He put away his book and rose from his seat. A beautiful man.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>He placed the book on his chest and said, &#x201C;Then I will ask a question.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Crockta&#x2019;s groups looked at each other at the sudden words. He continued speaking.</span></p><p><span>&quot;I had a dream a long time ago.&quot;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;......?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>It was suddenly a story about a dream. They were silent as they listened to the man&#x2019;s voice.</span></p><p><span>&quot;In the dream, I was a father with a son. He was a lovely son, and I felt like I could give everything in the world for him. Then one day, I found out that my child was sick. He was struck with a terminal illness that would slowly but surely lead to his death.&quot;</span></p><p><span>His face and voice were calm.</span></p><p><span>&quot;It was such a scary disease that I thought it was a &#x2018;promised death&#x2019;. My child&#x2019;s death was promised and no one could avoid it. It was the worst illness that caused terrible pain that no one could bear. That&apos;s why I decided. Rather than let my son die in agony, it was better for me to end his life.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>The man closed his eyes.</span></p><p><span>&quot;But when I talked about this, everybody called me crazy. This was because there were few people who know about the &#x2018;promised death.&#x2019; I said everything was for my child, but they didn&#x2019;t listen to me and exiled me so that I couldn&#x2019;t see my son. It was a thorough isolation. Now I will ask.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>They couldn&#x2019;t figure out what he would ask. Crockta listened closely.</span></p><p><span>The man asked, &quot;What do you think about me in the dream?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>It was a comprehensive question.&#xA0;</span><span>He didn&#x2019;t ask if what he thought was right or wrong, but wondered what they thought about him. Crockta touched his chin.&#xA0;</span><span>It felt like a test, just like the fights they encountered as they passed through the Black Forest.&#xA0;</span><span>If so, was this man the hermit of the Black Forest and was this the ultimate test?</span></p><p><span>The first one to answer was Anor.&#xA0;</span><span>&quot;It is too much. Even if your child is sick... what if your child wants to live for longer? Wanting to kill...maybe talk to your child...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;A child wouldn&#x2019;t understand what the &#x2018;promised death&#x2019; is. Wouldn&#x2019;t it be wrong to cause him pain just because of the future?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;What about the child? Even if it is painful, the child could want to live more...</span></p><p><span>&quot;A child wouldn&#x2019;t understand it.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;What...&quot;</span></p><p><span>&quot;How terrible the pain is.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;......&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Is that the end of your answer?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Anor wasn&#x2019;t able to say anything more and closed his mouth.</span></p><p><span>Tiyo replied next, &quot;You are foolish in your dream </span><i><span>dot</span></i><span>!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Why?&quot;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Anyway, life is about being alone! If there is the promised death, that is your son&#x2019;s share. You don&#x2019;t need to kill him. Besides, killing the child is simply futilely meddling in his fate!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Hrmm, is it like that?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;That&#x2019;s right </span><i><span>dot</span></i><span>.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;You don&#x2019;t understand the dream.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;What are you saying </span><i><span>dot</span></i><span>!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;My son fell in the water. If the child drowns, will you let that be the child&#x2019;s share?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;That is a different story </span><i><span>dot</span></i><span>!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;It is the same story.&quot;</span></p><p><span>Tiyo moaned and shook his head. The man started mumbling to himself.</span></p><p><span>Now it was Crockta&#x2019;s turn.&#xA0;</span><span>The hermit of the Black Forest looked at Crockta. He seemed to be waiting for the next answer. Crockta thought carefully.</span></p><p><span>The promised death.&#xA0;</span><span>Somehow, it was a familiar notion.&#xA0;</span><span>It was similar to what he heard from the desperate demon sleeping at his waist and the orc&#x2019;s story about the nameless god. The dream that the man was talking about felt like a dream.</span></p><p><span>Those who were desperate always had the same reason.</span></p><p><span>&quot;It was scary.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Crockta spoke up.&#xA0;</span><span>The hermit of the Black Forest shook his head.</span></p><p><span>&quot;No, the child didn&#x2019;t understand it.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Not the child.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Crockta looked at the hermit of the Black Forest. It was an emotionless face where no feelings could be found. Like a doll. Within the dark eyes that didn&#x2019;t show any contrast, was there a human mind that he could sympathize with?</span></p><p><span>&quot;You were scared.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>At that moment, the hermit&#x2019;s face seemed to shake.&#xA0;</span><span>But then his face became still again.</span></p><p><span>Crockta continued speaking, &quot;In a world where you can&#x2019;t understand the promised death, you were struggling with fear when you discovered your child&#x2019;s ending.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;......&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;You trembled with fear as you understood the true reality, and spent many nights before making the tragic decision for your child.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span><span>Crockta closed his eyes.&#xA0;</span><span>&quot;Just you.&quot;</span></p><p><span>He was a soldier fighting on the front lines. Therefore, he often went to a counselor to have his mental state checked. In the process, it was easy to know their consultation strategy.&#xA0;</span><span>There was the first step that the counselor had to take when dealing with clients.&#xA0;</span><span>It was to build up rapport!&#xA0;</span><span>The building of mutual trust through empathy!</span></p><p><span>Crockta said with tearful eyes, &quot;You must&#x2019;ve been very lonely. Really...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Then Crockta squinted at the hermit&#x2019;s expression.&#xA0;</span><span>The hermit of the Black Forest&#x2019;s face didn&#x2019;t change.</span></p><p><span>Damn, it was a failure.&#xA0;</span><span>The moment that Crockta was about to modify his strategy,</span></p><p><i><span>Churuk!</span></i></p><p><span>A tear flowed from the hermit&#x2019;s eyes.</span></p><p><span>&quot;......!&quot;</span></p><p><span>The expression still looked like ice but tears were flowing down from both eyes. He realized the change and stuttered.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Ah...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>He caught a teardrop with his fingertips and stared at it.&#xA0;</span><span>He was still expressionless, but he somehow gave off a lonely feeling.</span></p><p><span>His eyes turned to Crockta again.&#xA0;</span><span>Crockta felt like an intense scorer who broke past the goalkeeper and finished the game smoothly.</span></p><p><span>&quot;I also can&#x2019;t understand the promised death. But I can see that you had to make a really lonely and painful decision in your dream. I am really sorry.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Then he stared up at the sky. It was great directing.</span></p><p><span>The hermit stared at Crockta&#x2019;s face. Then he opened his mouth.&#xA0;</span><span>&quot;Yes.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>He waved his hand over his face and it became clean. It was magic.</span></p><p><span>&quot;It would have been really painful and lonely.&quot;</span></p><p><span>The corners of the hermit&#x2019;s mouth slowly went up.&#xA0;</span><span>It was a beautiful smile.</span></p><p><span>&quot;I&#x2019;m glad to know you.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>He clapped and the landscape changed.&#xA0;</span><span>Crockta&#x2019;s party was petrified.&#xA0;</span><span>The scenery in front of them was no longer the forest.&#xA0;</span><span>It was a huge castle.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;My name is Gushantimur. Travelers, welcome to my lair.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;...Oh my god.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>[Oh my god.]</span></p><p><span>The system was also filled with admiration.</span></p><p><span>[I pay my respects to you, the one who has melted the heart of the cool beauty, the black dragon Gushantimur!]</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p><p><a href="www.wuxiaworld.com">Glossary of Common Korean Terms.</a></p><p>Praise the Orc:&#xA0;<a href="docs.google.com">Glossary Link.&#xA0;</a></p><p>Current schedule:&#xA0;<strong>Next Patreon goal has been reached!!
