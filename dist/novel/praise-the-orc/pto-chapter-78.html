<p><span>Chapter 78 - Orcheim (3)</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p><p><span>&quot;I have traveled around the world. I wandered to the northernmost part of the continent and saw the most beautiful lands,&#x201D; Caburak said.</span></p><p><span> They walked from the hot spring towards the Holy Land of the orcs hidden deep in the forest.&#xA0;</span><span>The ecology of the forest gradually changed. There were strange plants that he saw for the first time. The green forest gradually became white, silver and a mixture of other colors.&#xA0;</span><span>Flowers and plants with a strange beauty that couldn&#x2019;t be seen anywhere else stood in front of them.</span></p><p><span>&quot;Wasn&#x2019;t the land of the dark elves in the north?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;At that time, such limits didn&#x2019;t apply to me. Kyulkyulkyul.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span><span>Caburak laughed.</span></p><p><span> &quot;Did you change your appearance?&#x201D; Crockta asked.</span></p><p><span>&quot;Kyulkyul, something like that.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>It was said that changing his appearance and deceiving others was very difficult magic. Crockta nodded. Caburak was certainly a mighty shaman.</span></p><p><span>&quot;I found an ominous presence in that place.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Caburak recalled his memories. It was the presence of a demon. It had been sleeping a long time to regain its strength, and its power was so strong that the fallen beings of that land were raising themselves into undead.</span></p><p><span>&quot;I asked for support from the dark elves but...they didn&#x2019;t believe me.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Um...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;The demon was soon about to wake up. I had no choice but to get rid of it alone.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>He was a great demon who called himself the demon king. He still hadn&#x2019;t recovered his strength but his undead army made him the worst to face alone.&#xA0;</span><span>If left alone, he would be resurrected and not just the dark elves, but the orcs and most of the north would be devastated.</span></p><p><span>That&#x2019;s why Caburak faced him alone.&#xA0;</span><span>He used the treasure of his family, the artifact called &#x2018;Constellation Staff&#x2019;, but it was destroyed during the battle.</span></p><p><span>Caburak was determined to die to stop it.&#xA0;</span><span>He fought using everything he had.&#xA0;</span><span>Thus, after using all his powers, he succeeded in killing the demon. &#xA0;</span><span>The price was his magic power, the Constellation Staff and...</span></p><p><span>His life force.</span></p><p><span>&quot;I won&#x2019;t be able to live for a long time...kyulkyulkyul!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;......!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Caburak laughed like it didn&#x2019;t mean anything.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Since I lost my strength and couldn&#x2019;t freely move around the north like before...I tried to return to Orcheim. I had just barely reached the territory of the orcs when I was captured by the Great Clan and sold as a slave. Then we met, Crockta!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>His eyes were telling the truth.&#xA0;</span><span>Caburak omitted a lot of the story, but Crockta knew of his hard work. Caburak, the orc shaman who sacrificed his life to save the world.&#xA0;</span><span>But his story wouldn&#x2019;t be remembered by anyone in history. His noble sacrifice wasn&#x2019;t recorded anywhere.</span></p><p><span>Now Caburak didn&#x2019;t look like a normal orc to Crockta.&#xA0;</span><span>Crockta asked, &quot;How can you laugh?&quot;</span></p><p><span>&quot;We&apos;re here.&#x201D; Caburak</span><span>&#xA0;pointed to the front instead of answering. Crockta turned his head.</span></p><p><span>There was a cave.&#xA0;</span><span>An unknown, refreshing feeling was felt from it. It was the opposite of the demonic energy of the Forest of Creatures.</span></p><p><span>&quot;Something feels good </span><i><span>dot</span></i><span>.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Kyulkyulkyul, follow me.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Upon entering the cave, Crockta felt a sense of deja vu.&#xA0;</span><span>Yes, it looked similar.&#xA0;</span><span>It resembled the path that he walked towards the Hall of Fame in Orcrox. The cave was artificially cut, like someone had touched the wall.</span></p><p><span>They walked through the darkness. Caburak created a light at his fingertips to light up the way.&#xA0;</span><span>They kept walking.&#xA0;</span><span>Finally, there was a large space at the end of the cave.</span></p><p><span>A monument stood there.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;This...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>It was the same as the monument that had the warrior&#x2019;s laws carved on it. There was writing in the ancient orc language that he couldn&#x2019;t understand.</span></p><p><span>&quot;It is a unique object from our god,&#x201D; said Caburak. </span><span>&quot;We don&apos;t believe in the gods. The Goddess of Benevolence, God of Light, God of War, etc. They aren&#x2019;t gods, they are just stronger than we are.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Tiyo nodded. Gnomes traditionally didn&#x2019;t have a religion. They were usually atheists.</span></p><p><span>Caburak laughed. The sound of his low laugh rang through the space. He raised the light to reveal the words written on the monument.&#xA0;</span><span>They were different from the warrior&#x2019;s laws.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Crockta,&#x201D; Caburak called out.&#xA0;</span>His eyes were clear. It was no longer Caburak&#x2019;s voice.</p><p><span>&#x201C;The world is like dust that runs into the void.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Crockta&#x2019;s eyes widened.&#xA0;</span><span>He heard a similar story somewhere before.</span></p><p><span>&quot;If you look at the universe, the world is empty and all living things will eventually sink into the void.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;......&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Some people believe in heaven after death, but it is inevitable that they will sink downwards.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>It was the story told by the demon when Crockta obtained the Demon&#x2019;s Belt. Crockta touched the belt. It didn&#x2019;t respond.&#xA0;</span><span>Caburak was talking about the same nothingness, but his voice was somewhat gentler.</span></p><p><span>&quot;In this tiny world, is your Bul&#x2019;tar meaningful?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;......!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;I killed the demon and saved the world. That was my honor. But Crockta, in a world that will sink anyway, is our clamoring meaningful? Don&#x2019;t you think?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Caburak was still laughing.</span></p><p><span>Crockta couldn&#x2019;t answer.&#xA0;</span><span>If he hadn&#x2019;t obtained the Despairing Demon&#x2019;s Mouth, he might not have considered his answer.&#xA0;</span><span>But he had been infused with the idea of the voice by the Demon&#x2019;s Mouth.&#xA0;</span><span>He witnessed it, making this question too difficult.&#xA0;</span><span>In the end, everything would die.</span></p><p><span>Caburak kept laughing as he looked at Crockta.&#xA0;</span><span>&quot;What do you think, Crockta?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Crockta looked at Caburak. The face of this broken orc seemed to already have its own answer.</span></p><p><span>Crockta replied, &quot;It doesn&apos;t really matter.&quot;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Hoh.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;No matter what meaning it has, I will do what I believe. I&#x2019;ll just do what I have to. Even if it doesn&#x2019;t make sense, I will walk along my own path.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Even if no one acknowledges you? What if no one understands, or if the world is against your beliefs?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;It will be the same.&quot;&#xA0;</span><span>Crockta also laughed as he looked at Caburak.&#xA0;</span><span>&quot;If the road is solitary, I will be a little lonely. But that is it.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Caburak&#x2019;s expression changed.&#xA0;</span><span>His eyes grew larger and he started to laugh out loud.</span></p><p><span>&quot;Only loneliness...you really are an orc. Crockta.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span><span>Then he pointed to the monument.&#xA0;</span><span>&quot;His voice came and he looked at us. He promised us only one thing.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Caburak cried out loudly, his voice echoing throughout the cave.</span></p><p><span>&quot;We will look so that you aren&#x2019;t lonely.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>He also heard this somewhere before.&#xA0;</span><span>A familiar face popped into his head.</span></p><p><span>Lenox.</span></p><p><span>&#x2018;God, please acknowledge me. See that our honor won&#x2019;t be lonely.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span>Lenox had said this before passing on the warrior&#x2019;s laws.</span></p><p><span>Caburak&apos;s voice continued, &quot;He who we don&#x2019;t understand or can&#x2019;t understand. He who builds the world and supports the world. And he who always watch us.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Crockta and Tiyo listened. Caburak&#x2019;s voice sounded like a spell in their heads.</span></p><p><span>&quot;He who blows the wind along our back when we walk the road alone.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span><span>Caburak&#x2019;s eyes turned towards the monument.&#xA0;</span><span>&quot;This is our god... no, our pathetic belief.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;......&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;I sacrificed my life to save the world. But nobody knows. If this was meaningless, how lonely would I be?&#x201D;&#xA0;</span><span>Caburak hit Crockta&#x2019;s shoulders.&#xA0;</span><span>&quot;So I desperately hoped. Someone is watching. That is why we walk through life with a sense of honor.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;That is the case.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;We believe in the forgotten god of the orcs, the nameless god.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Silence filled the space.</span></p><p><span>Tiyo spoke like he wanted to break the atmosphere.</span></p><p><span>&quot;We are the same dot. We gnomes are atheists. One gnome said that if there is something they can&#x2019;t understand, it isn&#x2019;t worthy of their faith. If they couldn&#x2019;t understand, there is no reason to believe in it. But we gnomes sometimes pray for salvation. Orcs are like gnomes.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Then Tiyo, you also believe in our nameless god. You can shout Bul&#x2019;tar nicely.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Bah, people who preach are disgusting dot!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Gnomes too. Kyulkyulkyul!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>They left the Holy Land.&#xA0;</span><span>It was called a Holy Land, but it was just a cave and monument.</span></p><p><span>He asked Caburak, &quot;Well, the reason why... it is the only relic left by our god, so we call it the Holy Land.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;I see.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Crockta looked up at the sky.&#xA0;</span><span>There was no difference from the sky in reality.&#xA0;</span><span>If he kept on playing Elder Lord, he would forget that this is a game. Once he heard about the orc&#x2019;s beliefs, he felt like this world was more realistic.</span></p><p><span>Looking at the smiling Caburak and straight-backed Tiyo, he could hardly think of them as meaningless existences.&#xA0;</span><span>The nameless god.</span></p><p><span>As Caburak said, he was watching over them.&#xA0;</span><span>Crockta was locked in his thoughts.&#xA0;</span><span>And at that moment, an arrow flew out from among the bushes.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Again?&#x201D;&#xA0;</span><span>Tiyo rolled his body and cried out like he was tired. Caburak ran towards the place where the arrow had fallen, while Crockta lowered his position and grabbed his greatsword.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;This isn&#x2019;t an arrow from a dark elf.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Then who</span><i><span> dot</span></i><span>?&#x201D;&#xA0;</span><span>Tiyo asked.</span></p><p><span>&quot;It is from a gnome&#x2019;s crossbow.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;What?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Tiyo&#x2019;s eyes widened. Arrows flew again. Crockta&#x2019;s group flung themselves down.&#xA0;</span><span>Then a voice was heard, &quot;This is the Holy Land of the orcs.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>An alluring female voice.&#xA0;</span><span>&quot;We can get rid of all of them. Kill them all.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Crockta looked for the source of the voice and saw a gap in the bushes.&#xA0;</span><span>A female gnome wearing armor was commanding the unit. She was small but she looked like a beautiful woman. </span><span>The gnomes followed her order and advanced quickly. They were all carrying crossbows.</span></p><p><span>&quot;Gnomes...</span></p><p><span>Tiyo&#x2019;s expression changed. He immediately seized General on his back.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Tiyo?&#x201D;&#xA0;</span><span>Crockta called out to him but Tiyo got up from the ground and fired General towards the front.</span></p><p><span>&quot;The ones who have forgotten the honor of the gnomes, die</span><i><span> dot</span></i><span>!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Colorful flashes hit the gnomes. There was a rain of magic bullets and due to the small size of the species, the gnomes couldn&#x2019;t endure the hit and collapsed.&#xA0;</span><span>Other gnomes tried to aim their crossbows but Tiyo moved quickly and disturbed them.</span></p><p><span>Crockta plunged in with his greatsword whenever there was a gap.</span></p><p><span>&quot;Be careful!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Crockta blocked the crossbow arrows with his greatsword. The gnomes shouted and tried to reload the arrows. However, giving such a moment to an orc warrior was a precursor to a slaughter.&#xA0;</span><span>A few gnomes held up shields and spears to stop Crockta. But it was clearly the difference between David and Goliath.</span></p><p><span>&quot;There is a gnome with an artifact.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>The gnome commander gritted her teeth. </span><span>She shouted in Tiyo&#x2019;s direction, &#x201C;You are a gnome! A gnome joining forces with those hostile to us, you should be ashamed!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Stop talking nonsense </span><i><span>dot</span></i><span>!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Tiyo jumped up.&#xA0;</span><span>Then Tiyo flinched and stopped as he was about to shout. He was at a loss after seeing the commander&#x2019;s face.</span></p><p><span>&quot;A tremendous beauty</span><i><span> dot</span></i><span>...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Tiyo muttered. The commander was embarrassed.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;...S-Shut up.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Tiyo soon regained his spirit.&#xA0;</span><span>&#x201C;I-In any case! Gnomes who are linked with trafficking slaves are shameful </span><i><span>dot</span></i><span>!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Bah, how old-fashioned!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Their eyes flashed as they glared at each other.&#xA0;</span><span>At that moment.&#xA0;</span><span>The bush next to Tiyo started shaking.&#xA0;</span><span>It was the enemy. A gnome soldier jumped out and aimed a spear at Tiyo.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;...Tiyo!&#x201D; Crockta shouted.</span></p><p><span>The spear was heading towards Tiyo&#x2019;s chest.&#xA0;</span><span>It was only for a moment.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Stupid child.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Tiyo skillfully dodged the attack and placed his arm around the enemy gnome&#x2019;s neck.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;...K-Keok!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Tiyo seemed hesitant, but he soon put strength in his arms.</span></p><p><i><span>Crunch.</span></i></p><p><span>The gnome&#x2019;s neck was broken and he fell down.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;......!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>An outstanding body!&#xA0;</span><span>Tiyo truly was like Bruce Lee.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Hoo.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Tiyo let go of the dead and stared up at the sky.&#xA0;</span><span>He never killed his own people.&#xA0;</span><span>He was a gnome of the Quantes garrison. He protected gnomes and never imagined that he would kill another gnome.</span></p><p><span>But the time had come for him to do so.&#xA0;</span><span>He killed the gnome with his own hands.</span></p><p><span>&apos;We walk our lives with honor.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span>He remembered Caburak&#x2019;s words. Then Tiyo nodded.&#xA0;</span><span>He would just believe as well.&#xA0;</span><span>His path was right.</span></p><p><span>Tiyo turned his head. The gnomes flinched. In addition to the powerful artifact, they were afraid of his ability to kill a soldier in a flash.</span></p><p><span>Tiyo met Crockta&#x2019;s gaze.&#xA0;</span><span>Crockta nodded. They were eyes that seemed to understand everything. Tiyo smiled at him.</span></p><p><span>He was a reliable colleague.&#xA0;</span><span>If so, there was nothing to hold him back.</span></p><p><span>&quot;Let&apos;s go, Crockta!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Yes!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Tiyo shouted as he rushed forward with General.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Bul&#x2019;tarrrr!&#x201D;</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p><p>I&apos;m going New Zealand tomorrow for 5 days.
