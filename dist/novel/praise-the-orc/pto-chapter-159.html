<p><span>Chapter 159 - Evil Solidarity (3)</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p><p><span>&quot;He is either stupid or clever,&#x201D; Keynes muttered.&#xA0;</span><span>He was currently talking about Crockta.&#xA0;</span><span>&quot;He isn&#x2019;t stupid, so why would he do such a stupid act?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;In my opinion...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;I&#x2019;m not asking you.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Keynes glared at Luin, who fell silent. It was rare for Keynes to show such a temper tantrum.&#xA0;</span><span>Instead, the silent Rommel opened his mouth, &quot;He is a beast.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Keynes nodded and said, &quot;A beast, a plausible yet strange analogy.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;He is smart, but only in comparison to other stupid beasts.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;And humans are people?&#x201D;&#xA0;</span><span>Keynes said with a laugh.</span></p><p><span>He appreciated Rommel.&#xA0;</span><span>He respected the parts of Rommel that couldn&#x2019;t be controlled, and that he had high abilities.</span></p><p><span>&quot;Don&#x2019;t you know that humans sacrifice themselves for others? But in the end, their instincts are to survive and reproduce.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span>&quot;I saw it in a book.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Sacrifice is an emotional thing. Follow the calculations of reasoning, not emotions. That is what a human is. Monkeys are those who follow emotions. Of course, it is funny when speaking about NPCs who have an artificial intelligence.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;It is interesting.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Keynes nodded. The answer was interesting. He learned a bit more about the person called Rommel. Keynes&#xA0;</span><span>was a person who controlled others, but sometimes he needed people like Rommel. A partner who could think along the same lines as him.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Luin.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Yes, Brother.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Are the clan kids arriving soon?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Huh? Yes.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;I am speaking of the &#x2018;fortunate&#x2019; kids...&#x201D;&#xA0;</span><span>Keynes touched his chin.&#xA0;</span><span>&quot;If you think about it, you should do it properly. Then you can achieve your lifelong dream here.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Huh?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;You don&#x2019;t understand?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;One person...are you saying you sent it?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Keynes laughed,&#xA0;</span><span>&quot;Hey, it is a joke. Threaten them. Intimidate them. Do it well. Be a bad person. A bad person who properly manages those fortunate kids.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Ahh...&#x201D;&#xA0;</span><span>Luin nodded.&#xA0;</span><span>&#x201C;Yes. That is my specialty. I will manage the kids.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Luin grinned and left the room. He was in such a hurry that he didn&#x2019;t even close the door.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>Keynes looked at his back and clicked his tongue.&#xA0;</span><span>&#x201C;Tsk tsk...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Rommel suddenly asked.&#xA0;</span><span>&quot;What are you playing at in regards to Luin?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Playing?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Don&#x2019;t you consider controlling people a game? You play with Emperor Akantor. Duke Christian was just a game.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Keynes laughed. That&#x2019;s right. He steered people. It was possible because he gave them what they wanted.&#xA0;</span><span>He made them think it was what they intended to do.&#xA0;</span><span>People were engrossed in Keynes&#x2019; sweet words and played like he wanted.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Luin wants to play a bad guy.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Play a bad guy...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;As a child, he was ignored while growing up. What could he do, when he didn&#x2019;t have any power? So he just pretended to live a good life. Then once he got money and a nice car, he did bad things and spit in God&#x2019;s face. A truly clumsy bastard.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;But I thought you regarded him as a brother.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Slightly. But this is this and that is that. I like him. His thoughts are transparent.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Keynes chuckled. Rommel also smiled and examined the map of the southern continent on the wall.&#xA0;</span><span>The class &#x2018;War Maestro&#x2019; wasn&#x2019;t just a name. He was always working.</span></p><p><span>&quot;How about me?&#x201D; Rommel asked.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;You?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;What type of play are you doing with me?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Rommel looked at Keynes.</span></p><p><span>Keynes laughed and opened the bottle placed on the table,&#xA0;</span><span>&quot;You are playing next to me. It is interesting.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Keynes acknowledged Rommel in his own way. Rommel received a cup.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;What about you?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Me? I...&quot;</span></p><p><span>Keynes and Rommel made a toast.&#xA0;</span><span>Soon they would lead the emperor&#x2019;s army.&#xA0;</span><span>It was the best accomplishment they could enjoy as a user. The message window to celebrate their achievements kept flashing.</span></p><p><span>&quot;I&#x2019;m not playing. This is just me.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Keynes drank the alcohol and laughed.</span></p><p></p><p style="text-align: center"><span>***</span></p><p></p><p><span>Crockta lifted a pen.&#xA0;</span><span>The world of Elder Lord was really mysterious. He wrote a letter while thinking in Korean, but the words that appeared were in the continent&#x2019;s language instead of Korean.&#xA0;</span><span>Nevertheless, he could understand the meaning.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;We, what are we doing now?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>A member of &#x2018;He&#x2019;s an Orc, yet still Praiseworthy&#x2019; asked miserably while moving his pen.&#xA0;</span><span>Unlike his facial expression, his hand was dazzling.</span></p><p><span>&quot;I don&#x2019;t know, we...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Gilgamesh listened to their conversation and said,&#xA0;</span><span>&quot;Perhaps it is &#x2018;fear&#x2019;...? Kukuk, I&#x2019;m envious...I lost such emotional nuances a long time ago... Kukukuk...!</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;......&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Whew...Shaq should&#x2019;ve been...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Every time Gilgamesh said such things, Shaq would promptly attack him.&#xA0;</span><span>Now there was no one restraining him. One person sighed.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;What is going on with Shaq?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;He posted on the forum. It seemed like something happened.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Shaq wrote on the forum that he wouldn&#x2019;t be able to connect to Elder Lord for a while. Everybody accepted it because they had their own lives.&#xA0;</span><span>But due to his writing, the five members with Crockta became known.&#xA0;</span><span>Shaq was lost so there were now only four, but they started to be called Crockta&#x2019;s five apostles in the community.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;There is no one else coming?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;They can&#x2019;t come to the south.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>There were people who wanted to join. But when Crockta had been fighting the empire, they withdrew from the south.&#xA0;</span><span>The type of users who could fight against the knights of the south wasn&#x2019;t common.</span></p><p><span>&quot;It looks like we really will die...&#x201D; one of Crockta&#x2019;s five apostles muttered.</span></p><p><span>They were currently writing letters of propaganda that provoked the emperor.&#xA0;</span><span>Each of them would show their talent at mocking the emperor, drawing cartoons that would be sent to him.&#xA0;</span><span>The letters would target everywhere, from the nobles to commoners, scholars, mages and even the Imperial Palace.</span></p><p><span>A person with the stealth skill would infiltrate the empire and sneak it into the post office.&#xA0;</span><span>The goal was to provoke the emperor.</span></p><p><span>&quot;Just send this amount and then stop. They will begin to start tracking it.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Yes.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Unlike her worries, she started to show off her artistic talents.</span></p><p><span>Everyone did their best.&#xA0;</span><span>Gilgamesh even drew a picture of the naked emperor being whipped.</span></p><p><span>Crockta scratched his head.&#xA0;</span><span>&#x201C;It is a bit...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Kukuk...Crockta, perhaps...&#x201D;&#xA0;</span><span>Gilgamesh lowered his voice.&#xA0;</span><span>&quot;Are you afraid of the emperor...?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;What are you talking about?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Then it doesn&#x2019;t matter what the level of this letter is.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;That is true.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;So Crockta, take this pen and add things. More irritating! Make the emperor so angry that he loses his hair!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Yes!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Crockta lifted the pen. Then he began to add his own style to Gilgamesh&#x2019;s work.&#xA0;</span><span>An arrow was placed above the head of the stripped and whipped emperor, then words added.</span></p><p><span>[This is a wig. The emperor is bald.]</span></p><p><span>It was propaganda stating that the emperor was bald.</span></p><p><span>&quot;Hah...!&#x201D;&#xA0;</span><span>Gilgamesh covered his mouth with his hands.&#xA0;</span><span>It was hard to believe his eyes.&#xA0;</span><span>&#x201C;No blood, no tears, no slander...! Any adults looking at this will shake in anger, not just the emperor. This is truly...! Kukuk...!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;This is the scale of Crockta.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Indeed, your sense of justice is unlike anyone else...kukukuk...!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Everyone finished their work.&#xA0;</span><span>A member of the thief class grabbed the packet of letters. He would go into the empire and send letters.&#xA0;</span><span>There would even be a letter sent directly to the emperor.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Will the emperor truly move?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Those with power are surprisingly simple.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Crockta intended to bring the enemy&#x2019;s attack to himself. Using a common word, it was to attract aggro.&#xA0;</span><span>The imperial troops were spread out over the entire south.&#xA0;</span><span>Villagers who surrendered were already provided labor for the empire&#x2019;s convenience.&#xA0;</span><span>If this happened, it would be hard to save the people.&#xA0;</span><span>It was better to anger the emperor and gather the army.</span></p><p><span>&quot;However, once the emperor has gathered his troops...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>But the others were worried.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Are you sure about this?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Crockta&#x2019;s point was true, but for this strategy to be successful, they needed to be able to deal with the enemy.&#xA0;</span><span>There was no point gathering the enemy only to die.&#xA0;</span><span>And they believed that Crockta had a clear way. Maybe an army of orcs would appear. Or maybe the cities of the continent will help...</span></p><p><span>But Crockta just shrugged his shoulders.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;I don&#x2019;t know.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Huh?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;I have no thoughts.&quot;&#xA0;</span><span>Crockta told them.&#xA0;</span><span>&quot;I will think about if after the enemies gather.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;......!&quot;</span></p><p><span>It was a shocking answer. He had no thoughts.&#xA0;</span><span>However, they strangely weren&#x2019;t worried.&#xA0;</span><span>As long as they were with Crockta, it felt like they could succeed in anything.</span></p><p><span>&quot;Let&#x2019;s think about it later. Kulkulkul, bul&#x2019;tar!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Huhu.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Kukuk!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>They nodded.&#xA0;</span><span>If they worried about the future, they wouldn&#x2019;t have succeeded in the many fights they experienced.</span></p><p><span>In the video of the fight at Chesswood, Crockta had said,</span></p><p><span>&#x2018;That is the calculations of a human.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span>He had different calculations than humans. His formula didn&#x2019;t consider things like the size and strength of the enemy.&#xA0;</span><span>Even though it changed from a village to the empire, this person&#x2019;s calculations hadn&#x2019;t changed at all.</span></p><p><span>How far could this man go?</span></p><p><span>The users exchanged glances.</span></p><p><span>&quot;Everyone, are you going to do it all the way?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Of course.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Kukuk...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>They would die.&#xA0;</span><span>From the viewpoint of the users, this was a reckless quest. It was an impossible mission with a hell difficulty, where the odds was close to zero.&#xA0;</span><span>But it didn&#x2019;t matter.&#xA0;</span><span>They were now with Crockta.&#xA0;</span><span>This was the most fun they had in Elder Lord.</span></p><p><span>Crockta told them.&#xA0;</span><span>&quot;If the emperor&#x2019;s eyes turn away from other villages and come to catch us, that is enough.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>The &#x2018;He&#x2019;s an Orc, yet still Praiseworthy&#x2019; decided to just follow Crockta and see what would happen.&#xA0;</span><span>Anyway, he was a man impervious to calculations.</span></p><p><span>Their plan was successful.&#xA0;</span><span>There was news that the imperial army was converging.</span></p><p></p><p style="text-align: center"><span>***</span></p><p></p><p><span>&quot;Guys! Everybody listen,&#x201D; Keynes said.</span></p><p><span>Those in front of him were the elites of the Heaven and Earth Clan.</span></p><p><span>&quot;At this time, Rommel and I have become nobles.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>The members of the Heaven and Earth Clan applauded.&#xA0;</span><span>It hadn&#x2019;t been possible for a user to become a noble since the launch of Elder Lord, so this was an unimaginable accomplishment.</span></p><p><span>&quot;Guys. Is Elder Lord fun?&#x201D;&#xA0;</span><span>Keynes smiled.&#xA0;</span><span>&quot;Where else could you kill people and pillage villages? This is why Elder Lord is fun. We can do things we&#x2019;ve always wanted to do, but never could.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>The Heaven and Earth members laughed.&#xA0;</span><span>In the past, they had won wars, trampled the rebels under the emperor&#x2019;s name, and enjoyed all sorts of looting.&#xA0;</span><span>They carried out the actions without any hesitation because it was a game.</span></p><p><span>They finally understood why there were endless wars in human history.&#xA0;</span><span>The winners who were given rights coveted it again, just like drugs.</span></p><p><span>&quot;Dialph, no, Park Kwangchul.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>He called a clan member. The clan members focused their attention.&#xA0;</span><span>Keynes only called their real name when something important happened.</span></p><p><span>&quot;Weren&#x2019;t you praised because you worked well before?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Yes!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;I sent money to your account.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Huh?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;You&#x2019;ll die if you use it for something else.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span><span>Keynes approached him and touched his shoulder.&#xA0;</span><span>&quot;Use it for a car, a foreign car. Understood?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;......!&quot;</span></p><p><span>The clan members all understood his will. Prior to any important work, Keynes would raise morale by giving out rewards.&#xA0;</span><span>It was a message that all of them could get a reward like Dialph.&#xA0;</span><span>In addition, the prize was enormous.</span></p><p><span>&quot;After buying it, send me a picture to prove it.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Keynes laughed and Dialph bowed with a thrilled face.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Brother, thank you!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;You should thank your parents, for giving birth to such a wonderful son. I just showed my appreciation.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Thank you, Brother!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;This brat. Come on everyone. I don&#x2019;t want him to be the only hard worker.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span><span>Keynes tapped his shoulder before going to stand next to Luin. Luin grinned as he raised his shoulders.</span></p><p><span>&quot;When the war begins, listen to Rommel. Rommel is the best.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Of course, there was no need to ask.&#xA0;</span><span>Rommel&#x2019;s &#x2018;War Maestro&#x2019; was a fraudulent class that forced soldiers on the battlefield to obey him.</span></p><p><span>&quot;Let&#x2019;s play a fun game today.
