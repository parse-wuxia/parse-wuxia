<p><span>Chapter 93 - Nameragon (2)</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p><p><span>Crockta&#x2019;s party set up camp near Nameragon.</span></p><p><span>Tiyo was messing around with General and trying to imagine a new form for his weapon.</span></p><p><span>Along with the Vulcan form that could fire many bullets at once, Tiyo wanted to develop the same destructive power as the cannon showed by Gushantimur. But it didn&#x2019;t seem to be working out very well.</span></p><p><span>Tiyo examined General and exclaimed, &#x201C;It is hard </span><i><span>dot</span></i><span>.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Then he looked at Anor who was playing with bones on the side.&#xA0;</span><span>Anor had received a few bones from the lich and was advised to diligently handle them in order to use the power of a necromancer in a more sophisticated manner.</span></p><p><span>He didn&#x2019;t know what animal bones they were, but they came alive once Anor injected his strength.&#xA0;</span><span>He wondered if they were dog bones as they ran around and rubbed themselves against Anor.</span></p><p><span>&quot;Can we really go into Nameragon </span><i><span>dot</span></i><span>?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>According to Crockta, Nameragon would need them two days later. The exact meaning was unknown but Crockta didn&#x2019;t explain, so they just waited silently.</span></p><p><span>&quot;Where is Crockta <em>dot</em>?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;He is going to look around.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Tiyo accidentally stepped on a bone.</span></p><p><span>&quot;Ah, don&#x2019;t step on my bones!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;You dark elves are really stiff </span><i><span>dot</span></i><span>. I didn&#x2019;t know Nameragon would react like this.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;That&apos;s right. They are very bad guys, which is why I cut my ears off.&quot;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;......&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Anor&#x2019;s ears were healed but traces of the forceful cutting remained. It wasn&#x2019;t a nice sight to see.&#xA0;</span><span>He didn&#x2019;t understand the impact it must&#x2019;ve had on Anor.</span></p><p><span>&quot;Which way did Crockta go </span><i><span>dot</span></i><span>?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;That way. Ah, totally cool. Did you change it again?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Huhuhu, this is the sniper edition. Sniper.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>General had grown longer and Tiyo placed it on his shoulder.&#xA0;</span><span>They were currently on the plains and could see Nameragon. They had decided to stay under a large zelkova tree.&#xA0;</span><span>There was a forest growing around Nameragon. It was a forest leading from the mountain side where the Black Forest was, but there were no threats like creatures present.&#xA0;</span><span>Crockta was going to take a look at it.</span></p><p><span>Tiyo looked for Crockta.&#xA0;</span><span>He felt Crockta&#x2019;s presence not long after he entered the forest. The orc&#x2019;s distinctive large body could easily be seen.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Crockta! What do you find </span><i><span>dot</span></i><span>?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Tiyo.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span><span>Crockta was standing in the middle of the forest and looking somewhere.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Did you find something </span><i><span>dot</span></i><span>?&#x201D;&#xA0;</span><span>Tiyo stood next to Crockta and looked in the direction of his gaze.</span></p><p><span>&quot;They&#x2019;ll need us in two days so you must know something.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Um...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Crockta frowned.</span></p><p><span>He was able to identity the lifespan of the elves on the walls of Nameragon using the Gray God&apos;s Eyes. All of them had two days remaining. This meant that most of the dark elf soldiers would die in two days.</span></p><p><span>The most likely thing was the orcs attacking, just like Nuridot.&#xA0;</span><span>A skill was used to secretly infiltrate Nuridot, so it was possible to use the same method to attack Nameragon.</span></p><p><span>So he looked around to see if he could find enemy scouts near Nameragon.&#xA0;</span><span>The best place to hide around Nameragon was the forest. It looked like it was flowing down from the mountain. After leaving the forest, it would only be a short walk to Nameragon.&#xA0;</span><span>It was strange no matter how he thought about it.</span></p><p><span>Crockta told Tiyo honestly.</span></p><p><span>Tiyo touched his chin and fell into thought.&#xA0;</span><span>&#x201C;Hrmm... The ability to see the remaining lifespan... and furthermore, two days </span><i><span>dot</span></i><span>?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;I was surprised as well.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;If we wait we&#x2019;ll know.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span><span>Tiyo nodded.&#xA0;</span><span>&quot;Can the lifespan change?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;I don&apos;t know yet.&quot;&#xA0;</span><span>Crockta checked the description of the skill but it didn&#x2019;t reveal anything else.&#xA0;</span><span>It wasn&#x2019;t a common skill as it was outside the ratings. Maybe that was the only way to obtain the skill.&#xA0;</span><span>&#x201C;We will find out in a few days.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Tiyo&#x2019;s eyes looked through the scope of General in sniper form.</span></p><p><span>&quot;But I don&#x2019;t see anyone aiming for Nameragon...&#x201D;</span></p><p></p><p style="text-align: center"><span>***</span></p><p></p><p><span>Two days passed.&#xA0;</span><span>There weren&#x2019;t any invaders like Crockta expected.</span></p><p><span>Crockta, Tiyo, and Anor sat around a campfire and eat a light stew while looking at Nameragon.</span></p><p><span>&quot;Crockta, the day has come</span><i><span> dot</span></i><span>. Are you certain?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Um...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>If the system&#x2019;s description was true, it was definitely happening today.&#xA0;</span><span>At that moment,</span></p><p><span>Anor cried out as he looked at Nameragon&#x2019;s walls, &#x201C;Ehhh...?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;What is it </span><i><span>dot</span></i><span>?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;I feel something.&quot;</span></p><p><span>&quot;What do you feel </span><i><span>dot</span></i><span>?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Anor rose from his spot with a hard expression.&#xA0;</span><span>&#x201C;Death.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span><span>He was a necromancer who dealt with death. His senses had developed after training with the lich at Gushantimur&#x2019;s lair.&#xA0;</span><span>&#x201C;Something is happening within Nameragon.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Tiyo devoured his bowl of stew before rising.&#xA0;</span><span>His hands naturally grabbed General.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;It is coming from inside.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Crockta also grabbed his greatsword.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;There.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>He saw smoke rising from Nameragon.</span></p><p><span>&quot;Something seems to be happening.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Crockta and Tiyo stepped forward first.&#xA0;</span><span>They approached Nameragon&#x2019;s gate but didn&#x2019;t see the soldiers who greeted them before. It was the same when Crockta knocked on the gate.&#xA0;</span><span>What was happening?</span></p><p><span>Crockta and Tiyo looked at each other.</span></p><p><span>&quot;Enter.&quot;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Good </span><i><span>dot</span></i><span>!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Crockta pulled out his greatsword.&#xA0;</span><span>The gate was hastily repaired so it wasn&#x2019;t as hard to destroy as before.</span></p><p><span>Crockta felt a little guilty as he swung Ogre Slayer again.&#xA0;</span><span>His blade tapped the gate.&#xA0;</span><span>Then the inside of Nameragon was revealed.</span></p><p><span>&quot;......!&quot;</span></p><p><span>Fires were occurring all over the place. Arrows were flying in the distance.&#xA0;</span><span>Crockta and Tiyo entered. They never imagined Nameragon looking so bleak. Battle noises were coming from everywhere.</span></p><p><span>The subjects of the fighting were all dark elves.&#xA0;</span><span>The dark elves of Nameragon had split in two and were fighting each other.</span></p><p><span>Crockta gulped at the sight.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;An internal schism...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Then all his questions were answered.&#xA0;</span><span>Crockta&#x2019;s party were well-known in the north.&#xA0;</span><span>They were good news for the dark elves who had to defend against the Great Clan&#x2019;s attacks after Nuridot.&#xA0;</span><span>The Luklan Mountains and Nuridot would&#x2019;ve sent messengers, but the reaction of the dark elves defending the walls was strangely hostile.</span></p><p><span>There was something wrong.</span></p><p><span>&quot;There, someone is collapsed </span><i><span>dot</span></i><span>!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Crockta and Tiyo discovered a dark elf. He was collapsed on the ground and bleeding.</span></p><p><span>&quot;Hey, are you okay</span><i><span> dot</span></i><span>?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Uhh...&#x201D;&#xA0;</span><span>He stared at Tiyo with blurry eyes.&#xA0;</span><span>&quot;Dwarf... it is futile...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;It isn&#x2019;t futile and I&#x2019;m not a dwarf </span><i><span>dot</span></i><span>!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Tiyo slapped his head.</span></p><p><span>Then the dark elf&#x2019;s face became more vivid as his spirit returned.</span></p><p><span>&quot;You are...?&quot;</span></p><p><span>&quot;I am Tiyo and this is Crockta. What is happening in Nameragon?&#x201D;&#xA0;</span><span>Anor poured a potion on his wound. If the dark elf received treatment then he wouldn&#x2019;t die.</span></p><p><span>&quot;Travelers... right now, Nameragon is divided.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;What are you talking about?</span></p><p><span>&quot;Those who want to keep the dark elf&#x2019;s legacy. And...&#x201D;&#xA0;</span><span>The dark elf got up.&#xA0;</span><span>&quot;The reformists who joined hands with the Great Clan to move forward.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;What about you?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;I can&apos;t trust the Great Clan. Holding hands with the crazy chieftain...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>He coughed. Blood flowed out. Anor stabilized him.</span></p><p><span>&quot;The dark elves who didn&#x2019;t trust the Great Clan were predominant, but at some point, a person named Aden appeared and started to recruit people. Their numbers grew until this bloodshed began in Nameragon...&#x2019;</span></p><p><span>It was at that moment.&#xA0;</span><span>An arrow flew towards the dark elf.</span></p><p><span>Crockta&#x2019;s hand moved and caught it.</span></p><p><span>&quot;......!&quot;</span></p><p><span>The dark elf gulped as he belatedly noticed that the attack.&#xA0;</span><span>Crockta glanced in the direction of the attack. There was a group of dark elves holding arrows and knives.</span></p><p><span>&quot;Who are you?&quot;</span></p><p><span>Crockta got up.&#xA0;</span><span>The dark elves became nervous at the sight of the orc&#x2019;s burly body. It was like a bunch of foxes greeting a tiger.&#xA0;</span><span>Crockta stepped forward while they retreated.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;A-Are you from the Great Clan? Then we aren&#x2019;t enemies.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>A dark elf said. Crockta and Tiyo exchanged glances.&#xA0;</span><span>At that moment, the enemy was identified.</span></p><p><span>&quot;Not the Great Clan, but those who came to hunt the Great Clan </span><i><span>dot</span></i><span>!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Tiyo fired General.&#xA0;</span><span>The elves couldn&#x2019;t respond to the sudden burst of continuous fire and fell down. Crockta ran and subdued them.</span></p><p><span>&quot;Maybe we should meet the leader of Nameragon </span><i><span>dot</span></i><span>.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Crockta agreed.&#xA0;</span><span>He didn&#x2019;t know who he should wield his sword against.</span></p><p><span>They brought the collapsed dark elf with them and walked through Nameragon.&#xA0;</span><span>Arrows were flying here and there. Dead bodies were scattered all over the place.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Where can I find the leader?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>The dark elf helped by Anor answered Crockta&#x2019;s question.&#xA0;</span><span>&quot;He will be building a line of defense at City Hall...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;City Hall?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;If you go that way...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>They turned the corner and saw a group of dark elves.&#xA0;</span><span>The dark elves discovered Crockta&#x2019;s party and also raised their weapons.</span></p><p><span>Crockta also raised his greatsword.</span></p><p><span>&quot;We have come to help Nameragon. Which side are you on?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;I came to help Nameragon.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>A dark elf came forward. It was a dark elf with scars on his face. Everyone watched his movements like he was the leader.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;An orc with a red headband and a greatsword, yes, you are clearly Crockta.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;......!&quot;</span></p><p><span>He knew Crockta.</span></p><p><span>&quot;And the dwarf who is Crockta&#x2019;s...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;What </span><i><span>dot</span></i><span>?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Tiyo raised General.</span></p><p><span>The dark elf continued.&#xA0;</span><span>&#x201C;Half breed trash with the ears cut off...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;I wonder how your face will look once I smash it into the ground, you fucking bastard.</span></p><p><span>Anor used his unique cursing defense mechanism before the words were over.&#xA0;</span><span>The dark elf looked stunned for a moment.</span></p><p><span>&quot;Very vulgar...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Crockta stepped forward with his greatsword.</span></p><p><span>&quot;It is bullshit, especially after seeing how relaxed you are. Whatever the case, reveal yourselves first.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Huhu, excess self-confidence is like poison.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>He clapped his hands.&#xA0;</span><span>Then a dark elf walked forward. The dark elf was holding a sword in both hands.&#xA0;</span><span>His eyes stared blankly at Crockta. There were no emotions in them, like he was a doll.</span></p><p><span>&quot;Kill the trash that disturbs the north.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Yes.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>The dark elf with the double swords came at them.&#xA0;</span><span>Crockta felt an unknown momentum from him. His movements were light. This guy wasn&#x2019;t trash.&#xA0;</span><span>He glanced at Tiyo and Anor and already plotted a battle strategy with them.</span></p><p><span>&quot;I&#x2019;ll go first</span><i><span> dot</span></i><span>!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Tiyo fired General.&#xA0;</span><span>General&#x2019;s colorful magic bullets flew towards him.</span></p><p><span>At that moment, the dark elf with the double swords muttered.</span></p><p><span>&quot;......!&quot;</span></p><p><span>A magic circle floated in the air and absorbed all of Tiyo&#x2019;s attacks. The magic circle shone as it received more energy and revolved around the dark elf.&#xA0;</span><span>His expression was still calm.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Magic swordsman?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>A dark elf with long grey hair, wielding double swords and magic.&#xA0;</span><span>Crockta gulped.&#xA0;</span><span>This didn&#x2019;t seem easy.</span></p><p><span>Crockta blinked.&#xA0;</span><span>In the short moment that he closed his eyes and opened them again...</span></p><p><span>The dark elf&#x2019;s double swords were already before him. &#xA0;</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p><p><a href="www.wuxiaworld.com">Glossary of Common Korean Terms.</a></p><p>Praise the Orc:&#xA0;<a href="docs.google.com">Glossary Link.&#xA0;</a></p><p>Current schedule:&#xA0;<strong>Next Patreon goal has been reached!!
