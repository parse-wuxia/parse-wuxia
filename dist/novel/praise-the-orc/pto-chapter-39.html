<p><span>Chapter 39 - Honorary Citizen</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p><p><span>Under the cover of night, Crockta crossed the wall. Mayor Elsanad&#x2019;s mansion was quiet.&#xA0;</span><span>He walked past the garden and up to the front door. He turned the doorknob, opening the door. A deep darkness blanketed the inside.</span></p><p><span>Crockta stepped forward.&#xA0;</span><span>His footsteps echoed thanks to the structure of the mansion.&#xA0;</span><span>His eyes scanned the darkness. The mansion, which was beautiful under the sun, looked creepy in the darkness.</span></p><p><i><span>Chobeok.</span></i> <i><span>Chobeok.</span></i></p><p><span>He crossed the corridor while looking in the rooms.&#xA0;</span><span>None of the doors were locked.&#xA0;</span><span>He passed by the deserted ones. Then suddenly, Crockta saw a shape looking at him in the darkness.</span></p><p><span>&quot;......!&quot;</span></p><p><span>It was a statue.&#xA0;</span><span>The faint moonlight shining through the windows gave him a glimpse of the outline. It was a statue of an elf staring into the air.</span></p><p><span>Crockta reached out to it. The texture of cold plaster could be felt.&#xA0;</span><span>The physical shape looked real, and it seemed like it would move in the darkness.</span></p><p><span>Crockta slowly turned his gaze to the side. The elf statue was guarding something. The door was firmly closed.&#xA0;</span><span>He grabbed the handle, but the door didn&#x2019;t open.&#xA0;</span><span>It was the only locked place that he had discovered in Elsanad&#x2019;s mansion.</span></p><p><span>Crockta looked around. It was dark but his eyes could see the shape of everything.&#xA0;</span><span>Nothing moved.&#xA0;</span><span>There were no indications of any people.&#xA0;</span><span>It was eerie.&#xA0;</span><span>Crockta gave strength to his hand. He gripped the doorknob tightly. It gradually creaked until it fell off with a low sound. Pieces of the door fell off.</span></p><p><span>The door opened.&#xA0;</span><span>Crockta entered. Then he flinched once again.&#xA0;</span><span>In the large room, there were several statues similar to the one at the entrance. They looked so alive that he almost swung his greatsword at them.</span></p><p><span>Crockta explored inside. In addition to the statues, paintings were hung on the walls. The paintings were expensive pieces of artwork signed by the artist.&#xA0;</span><span>It was a room where Elsanad&#x2019;s aesthetics could be felt.</span></p><p><span>Crockta wandered through the room and paused in front of a painting.&#xA0;</span><span>It was crude compared to the other paintings. However, it was the signed name below that made him stop.</span></p><p><span>Elwina.&#xA0;</span><span>Elsanad&#x2019;s daughter.</span></p><p><span>It was a crude work with a human and elf standing side by side. Elwina had tried to draw every detail, despite her lack of skills. It was a painting drawn by a person with a high interest in the human body.</span></p><p><span>Crockta looked at it for a while before lifting the painting from the wall.&#xA0;</span><span>He found it.&#xA0;</span><span>There was a recess in the wall where the painting was hanging, with a button inside.</span></p><p><span>Crockta pressed it.&#xA0;</span><span>The floor started to tremble slightly.&#xA0;</span><span>Crockta turned his head towards the sound. The bottom of the floor was slowly opening. Slowly, stairs leading downwards were revealed.&#xA0;</span><span>They were stairs heading to the basement.</span></p><p><span>Alsein&#x2019;s voice telling him to visit Elsanad&#x2019;s basement popped into Crockta&#x2019;s head.</span></p><p><span>It was here. Crockta took one step. It was a small passage for him. One step, two steps, his footsteps echoed as he descended.</span></p><p><span>He headed downwards for a while before reaching the end of the stairs. There was a door.&#xA0;</span><span>Something was beyond it.&#xA0;</span><span>Crockta remembered Alsein&#x2019;s eyes. His eyes had been shaking. What did he know? What was he troubled over?</span></p><p><span>Crockta opened the door.&#xA0;</span><span>Then he took one step.</span></p><p><span>&quot;......!&quot;</span></p><p><span>A chill went down his spine.&#xA0;</span><span>There were the dark shadows of dozens of people who were looking at Crockta in the darkness.</span></p><p><span>He lowered the hand that had moved to the handle of his greatsword. His fingers shook.&#xA0;</span><span>They didn&#x2019;t move.</span></p><p><span>Inside the basement there were people staring blankly at the air, not at Crockta. Crockta&#x2019;s heart sank as he saw their faces.</span></p><p><span>The face of Elwina, who greeted visitors at the entrance of Arnin, popped into his head. He later found out that she was Elsanad&#x2019;s daughter. He thought that she was just a spoiled person.&#xA0;</span><span>But that wasn&apos;t it.</span></p><p><span>In fact, she had a world of her own that she couldn&#x2019;t communicate with others.&#xA0;</span><span>It was a world that could never be tolerated.</span></p><p><span>Crockta reached for a nearby elf. He felt soft skin, but it was cool and didn&#x2019;t feel alive.</span></p><p><span>&#x2018;Is this why she&#x2019;s so obsessed with working as a guard?&#x2019;</span></p><p><span>Alsein had said this in passing and Crockta now realized what he meant.&#xA0;</span><span>She chose victims that no one would care about if they died. No one would know where and how they had disappeared. Visitors disappeared in droves after visiting Arnin.</span></p><p><span>Elwina&#x2019;s goal was those visitors.&#xA0;</span><span>Crockta was no exception.</span></p><p><span>&quot;It is a tragedy.&quot;</span></p><p><span>Crockta muttered.&#xA0;</span><span>His head dropped as he was surrounded by dozens of stuffed victims.</span></p><p><span>All of them were beautiful.&#xA0;</span><span>A face with beautiful proportions. Dark blue eyes. Unusual hair color or pinkish red lips. The slender legs, elegant shoulders, and long, delicate necks made them victims.</span></p><p><span>Elwina had stuffed them to maintain their beauty and to keep them forever in her collection.&#xA0;</span><span>It was a horrible tragedy.</span></p><p><span>Crockta closed his eyes.</span></p><p><span>Their sins weighed heavily on him.&#xA0;</span><span>Arnin was a beautiful city, but it was an abode where numerous beasts with human faces were tangled together.</span></p><p><span>A demon sold his people for wealth and power, deceiving his victims with a smile.&#xA0;</span><span>The other demon, who stuffed the visitors of the city, strolled among the citizens under the protection of her mother.</span></p><p><span>All of the citizens believed in and followed them.&#xA0;</span><span>It was a terrible mess of deception and evil.&#xA0;</span><span>There was no truth anywhere.</span></p><p><span>Crockta&#x2019;s hand clenched into a fist, his body starting to uncontrollably shake. The stuffed truths were staring at Crockta.&#xA0;</span><span>He raised his eyes.&#xA0;</span><span>His eyes met those of an elf child.&#xA0;</span><span>The little elf child was smiling.&#xA0;</span><span>That smile was stopped forever.</span></p><p><span>Crockta sighed.</span></p><p><span>Lenox.&#xA0;</span><span>His face popped into Crockta&#x2019;s head.</span></p><p><span>&#x2018;What would you do?</span></p><p><span>Would you have an answer for this tragedy?&#x2019;</span></p><p><span>Lenox looked at him and smiled. He slowly opened his mouth.&#xA0;</span><span>Lenox&#x2019;s voice echoed. He only said one word to Crockta, but it was enough.</span></p><p><span>There was always only one answer.</span></p><p><span>Crockta nodded.</span></p><p><span>Bul&#x2019;tar.</span></p><p></p><p style="text-align: center"><span>***</span></p><p></p><p><span>The sun shone in the sky.</span></p><p><span>Ilya and Mayor Elsanad met again in the square to debate over the controversial issue and to determine who the next mayor would be.&#xA0;</span><span>The two mayor candidates. Elsanad and Ilya.&#xA0;</span><span>Depending on the outcome of this debate, the future of Arnin would be decided.</span></p><p><span>&quot;Elsanad, changing the topic is meaningless. You are the culprit. There is clear evidence with this book, yet you would deny your sins until the end?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;I can&#x2019;t say anything. It is a fake book, anyone could make that. I could also forge a book and claim that you were behind it.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Do you admit that you would handle things that way? Did you run the city like this? Through forgery and deceit?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;You use cowardly means. Don&#x2019;t change the topic. Right now, what you are doing is deception.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>The conversation was going nowhere. Elsanad countered calmly, but Ilya was excellent at stirring up the citizens.&#xA0;</span><span>The crowd split in half and cheered for the politician they were supporting.&#xA0;</span><span>Arnin guards were around the stage in case of an emergency.</span></p><p><span>Ilya and Elsanad continued the debate on the stage.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>Now no one was concerned about the victims.&#xA0;</span><span>The story of the elves being trafficked had been forgotten, and the voices of the victims vanished without a trace as no one in Arnin cared for such things.</span></p><p><span>One orc ran across the square.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;W-What?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>The man who was bumped into turned his head away as he met the orc&#x2019;s fierce gaze.&#xA0;</span><span>The orc had a determined expression on his face.&#xA0;</span><span>His greatsword was on his shoulder as he walked towards Elsanad and Ilya.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Entry isn&#x2019;t permitted.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>The guards around the stage blocked him. The orc didn&#x2019;t go any further. He stood there and looked at the two politicians.&#xA0;</span><span>Ilya suddenly noticed his presence and turned his head towards the orc. However, he didn&#x2019;t care about the orc, and kept criticizing Elsanad. Elsanad&#x2019;s eyes darkened.</span></p><p><span>There was no guilt in them.&#xA0;</span><span>The orc confirmed this fact and turned towards the citizens.&#xA0;</span><span>He saw the faces of the citizens. Interest, tension excitement etc., all types of emotions were swirling.</span></p><p><span>However, there wasn&#x2019;t what he needed most.&#xA0;</span><span>It was anger.&#xA0;</span><span>No one was truly angry.</span></p><p><span>The orc felt anger fill his chest as he shouted.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Everyone&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>The orc&#x2019;s voice rang out in the square.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Quiet&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>An intense cry that shook the eardrums of the listeners.&#xA0;</span><span>The shouting of an orc warrior, which hadn&#x2019;t been heard for a long time in Arnin, shook Arnin Square.</span></p><p><span>&quot;......!&quot;</span></p><p><span>A sobering voice!&#xA0;</span><span>The square became quiet in an instant.&#xA0;</span><span>Everyone looked at the orc who was the epicentre of the sound.&#xA0;</span><span>The guards didn&#x2019;t know what to do and just watched him. Ilya and Elsanad, who were making claims on the stage, also quieted down.</span></p><p><span>All the eyes and ears in the square were focused on the orc.&#xA0;</span><span>The orc lifted something up.&#xA0;</span><span>A crystal ball was in his thick hands.</span></p><p><span>Ilya&#x2019;s face turned pale.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Now.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Crockta declared. Then a human came forward.</span></p><p><span>It was a human magician, Puri. He had been helped by Crockta on the plains along with Gilliam, so he was now paying back the favor.&#xA0;</span><span>Puri raised a hand, his magic power wrapping around the crystal ball.</span></p><p><span>The crystal ball started shining.&#xA0;</span><span>In the air, a giant video appeared.&#xA0;</span><span>It was the memory playback magic that could play videos in the crystal ball!&#xA0;</span><span>It was an expensive item, and the magic required to activate it was difficult. The citizens paid attention to it.</span></p><p><span>The video that appeared was stabilized.&#xA0;</span><span>Someone&#x2019;s face appeared.&#xA0;</span><span>It was Ilya, his face floating in the air. He moved within the crystal ball and spoke. His remarks were reproduced.</span></p><p><i><span>-...Yes, I will tell you everything.</span></i> <i><span>I sold the elves together with the people from Thawing Balhae.</span></i> <i><span>I had a deal with them.</span></i></p><p><span>Ilya jumped up.</span></p><p><span>-...</span><i><span>And I got tired of them.</span></i> <i><span>I had drained just enough from them.</span></i> <i><span>Those cursed by the stars, did they really think I would deal with them forever?</span></i> <i><span>Thank you for your help.</span></i></p><p><span>The citizens started murmuring again.&#xA0;</span><span>The truth that they were arguing over had finally been revealed. Ilya&#x2019;s ugly remarks followed.</span></p><p><span>-...</span><i><span>Anyway, I will become Arnin&#x2019;s next mayor.</span></i> <i><span>That&#x2019;s it.</span></i> <i><span>You can leave quietly.</span></i></p><p><span>The eyes of the citizens turned towards Ilya in unison. His face distorted and Elsanad&#x2019;s face brightened.&#xA0;</span><span>She didn&#x2019;t know who the orc was, but he had given evidence of her innocence. She used this momentum.</span></p><p><span>A complacent expression appeared on her face.</span></p><p><span>&quot;Citizens! Have you seen everything? This man tried to discredit me and fool the citizens!&#x201D;&#xA0;</span><span>She raised her fist.&#xA0;</span><span>&quot;As the mayor of Arnin and a citizen, I will make a formal accusation against the coward Ilya!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Then she shouted to one of the Arnin guards.</span></p><p><span>&quot;Guard, take him to jail right now!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>The citizens alternated looking between Elsanad, Ilya, and the orc. They were confused due to the sudden situation.&#xA0;</span><span>However, the citizens soon responded to Elsanad&#x2019;s words.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;That guy!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Ilya was the culprit!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;The mayor is innocent!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>But the video didn&#x2019;t end there.&#xA0;</span><span>The screen jumped and this time a white mansion at night appeared.</span></p><p><span>It was a building that every citizen in Arnin knew.&#xA0;</span><span>The mansion was one of the most beautiful buildings in Arnin.&#xA0;</span><span>Elsanad&#x2019;s home.</span></p><p><span>The citizens stopped again.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;......?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>The video moved gradually as it followed the eyes of the filmer.</span></p><p><span>Over the wall and once inside, the person arrived at a room filled with statues and paintings. Elsanad&#x2019;s mansion continued to be shown. The citizens looked at the screen with confusion over what they were seeing.</span></p><p><span>Elsanad&#x2019;s face stiffened as she saw it.</span></p><p><span>&quot;Stop that right now!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>She tried to run off the stage.&#xA0;</span><span>But Ilya grabbed Elsanad&#x2019;s wrist. He sensed something in her reaction.</span></p><p><span>On the video, the secret door to the basement opened.&#xA0;</span><span>The video started going down.</span></p><p><span>Elsanad shouted, &quot;Guards! Stop that orc! Stop him!&#x201D;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>But the video continued without stopping.</span></p><p><span>&quot;......!&quot;</span></p><p><span>The terrible truth was revealed.&#xA0;</span><span>The citizens were surprised to see the elves and humans inside the room, and were shocked as they understood what it meant.&#xA0;</span><span>It was a terrible scene that they had never imagined.</span></p><p><span>The owner of the video gazed at the stuffed animals for a while. On the screen, the faces of the elves, humans, and a smiling child could be seen. The screen moved along with his eyes.&#xA0;</span><span>At first glance, there were more than 20 stuffed people. Everyone looked alive and motionless, like they were still breathing.</span></p><p><span>There were citizens who stumbled at the scene. The truth was harsh. This demon, who was a &#xA0;serial killer, was the leader of the city.&#xA0;</span><span>The gaze of the person filming moved downwards.</span></p><p><span>He looked at his feet. The screen displayed the floor.&#xA0;</span><span>The murmur of the person filming resonated in the ears of the citizens.</span></p><p><i><span>-It is a tragedy.</span></i></p><p><span>It was a calm voice. Then the screen showing the floor cut off.</span></p><p><span>The crystal ball finished its role and broke into pieces.&#xA0;</span><span>The video ended, but nobody moved.</span></p><p><span>Silence.&#xA0;</span><span>Everyone in the square had stopped moving.&#xA0;</span><span>In that stillness, the orc alone moved.</span></p><p><span>He turned around. He gazed towards Ilya and Elsanard, the two demons, and said.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Ilya and Elsanad.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>They didn&#x2019;t move.</span></p><p><span>&quot;With the evidence I just presented, I accuse you.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>The stunned guards recovered their spirits.&#xA0;</span><span>They looked at each other and then started walking towards Ilya and Elsanad.&#xA0;</span><span>Now they were horrible criminals.</span></p><p><span>Elsanad exclaimed, &quot;Don&apos;t make me laugh! This is all fabricated! You might have a pass to enter Arnin, but you aren&#x2019;t a citizen! Not even a citizen, yet a dirty orc dares accuse me? Impossible!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>It was her last-ditch effort.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&quot;On the subject of the orc! Who the hell are you listening to? Guards, do you believe an orc over your mayor? Someone who isn&#x2019;t even a citizen?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>It was Elsanad&#x2019;s futile struggle to delay her downfall.&#xA0;</span><span>Even Ilya stared at Elsanad with disgust in his eyes.&#xA0;</span><span>But Elsanad was the mayor. The guards stopped moving the moment they heard her cry. Then they looked at the orc accusing her.</span></p><p><span>All eyes fell on the orc once again.&#xA0;</span><span>But he had a cold expression on his face.</span></p><p><span>The orc opened his mouth, &quot;Listen up, Elsanad.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>The orc spoke in a distinctively thick and low voice.&#xA0;</span><span>&quot;I am someone who is equal to the citizens of Arnin.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>His voice rang out through the square.</span></p><p><span>&quot;All rights enjoyed by the citizens of Arnin are equally applied to me. It is a legitimate right granted for the dedication and merits I have contributed to Arnin, one that nobody can withdraw unless I commit an offense that undermines Arnin&#x2019;s justice.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>He pulled something out. His evidence sparkled under the sun.&#xA0;</span><span>Everyone&#x2019;s gaze turned to the proof of identity.</span></p><p><span>The orc declared, &quot;I am Crockta, the one given an honorary citizenship by Enyanis, the plains administrator.&#x201D;</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p><p>Reminder, I will be having a monthly Q&amp;A on the Wuxiaworld Discord Channel.
