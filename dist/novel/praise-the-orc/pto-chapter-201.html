<p><span>Chapter 201 - Opening of the War (1)</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p><p><span>The military expedition also received a cold shoulder in Quantes.&#xA0;</span><span>Crockta was a hero who saved the city from the cursed item called the &#x2018;Demon&#x2019;s Mouth&#x2019;, but Aklan didn&#x2019;t care, as he had now stopped worrying about Crockta.</span></p><p><span>No matter what Crockta did, he was an enemy. A saint could kill a saint, and a wicked man could kill a wicked man.&#xA0;</span><span>He erased all previous doubts.</span></p><p><span>&quot;Something&#x2019;s wrong.&quot;</span></p><p><span>Peros was a noble who knew Anail&#x2019;s back alley very well.&#xA0;</span><span>His plan to put pressure on Thompson failed.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;The head of the underworld has changed, and the new leader is Crockta&#x2019;s friend. Rather, the messenger was beaten to death...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Friend...&#x201D;&#xA0;</span><span>Aklan laughed.&#xA0;</span><span>&#x201C;It is funny.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;T-That&#x2019;s right.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Thompson said the same thing.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Really? He has really wide feet. Hahahat...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;......&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Haha...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Peros laughed awkwardly.&#xA0;</span><span>The aura coming from Aklan was sharper and darker than ever.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;It doesn&#x2019;t matter. This is a little inconvenient, but having extra help is unnecessary. We have a sufficient number of troops and plenty of funds.&quot;</span></p><p><span>They had difficulties in some of the major cities, but there were enough volunteers.&#xA0;</span><span>The scale of the military expedition was unthinkable, and was perhaps the largest number of people in history gathered under a single flag.&#xA0;</span><span>The orcs would be trampled on by this army and forgotten.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;The gods are helping us.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Yes...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;The gods are still whispering. In the end, we will win.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>The expedition didn&#x2019;t need anything else.&#xA0;</span><span>Aklan was convinced.&#xA0;</span><span>No matter how strong the orcs were, they wouldn&#x2019;t be able to resist the wrath of the gods.</span></p><p><span>&quot;Victory is only a matter of time. Please relax your mind.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>An unknown power emerged from Aklan as he said this.&#xA0;</span><span>He gripped his fists tightly.&#xA0;</span><span>His body shuddered as his whole body filled with an unknown strength.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;The war god has spoken.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Ah, I understand.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Peros stepped back, confused by Aklan&#x2019;s changed appearance.&#xA0;</span><span>The smell of fanaticism was coming from Aklan.&#xA0;</span><span>Adandator watched Aklan and asked, &#x201C;Are you okay?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;I am as okay as ever.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;You know...&#x201D;&#xA0;</span><span>Adandator studied Aklan and sighed.&#xA0;</span><span>He could see that Aklan was in an unknown state.&#xA0;</span><span>&quot;Any more divine power will break your body.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>The power of a god dwelt in Aklan.&#xA0;</span><span>It was an arrangement for the future war.&#xA0;</span><span>Adandator didn&#x2019;t know what the war god was planning, but a tremendous amount of divine power was entering Aklan.</span></p><p><span>Aklan smiled and said, &quot;It&apos;s okay. It is different from what you are concerned about. I am more powerful than ever.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;...Yes. You would know best.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Adandator shrugged. In fact, he didn&#x2019;t care about Aklan&#x2019;s condition.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;We are finally at Orcrox.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Yes. I can see the end.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Aklan smiled.&#xA0;</span><span>At last, this expedition was heading towards the climax.&#xA0;</span><span>The expedition passed through Quantes and arrived in Anail.&#xA0;</span><span>They also didn&#x2019;t receive hospitality in Anail. The king of the underworld, Jeremy, and Thompson were close to Crockta.</span></p><p><span>Everywhere they went, they saw people who saw Crockta as their savior.</span></p><p><span>He was the one who made the volunteer group, the hero who saved a village, the honorary citizen who exposed the ugly side of the mayor, the warrior who stopped the demon in a city, and the savior of many influential people.</span></p><p><span>But he had brought the wrath of the gods on him.&#xA0;</span><span>No matter what Crockta had done, he was defined by the last line.&#xA0;</span><span>Anyway, everything was decided by the gods.&#xA0;</span><span>Human work was useless against divine matters.</span></p><p><span>The lead riders waved their flags. They reported something to Aklan and Adandator.&#xA0;</span><span>Indeed, as they said, something could be seen in the distance.&#xA0;</span><span>All the leaders were agitated.&#xA0;</span><span>Aklan smiled.</span></p><p><span>They were orcs.&#xA0;</span><span>They had come out, rather than hiding in Orcrox.</span></p><p><span>A battlefield suitable for the climax.&#xA0;</span><span>It was the opening of the great war.</span></p><p></p><p style="text-align: center"><span>***</span></p><p></p><p><span>Ian looked at Yiyu with a mouth full of Burger King&#x2019;s extra large burger.</span></p><p><span>&quot;Why do you look like that?&#x201D; she asked.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;You&#x2019;re acting like a beggar.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;......&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Yiyu snorted before eating her hamburger again and drinking some soda with her straw.&#xA0;</span><span>Ian picked up some fries and placed them in his mouth.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Eat slowly.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>He had accessed Elder Lord for so long that he hadn&#x2019;t seen her in a while, so they went out together.</span></p><p><span>&quot;You know what? There will be another great war in Elder Lord. Will Oppa be taking part? You have been living in the game lately.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>The fight between the expedition and the orcs was a hot topic in reality.&#xA0;</span><span>This time, users weren&#x2019;t involved since it was a dispute between NPCs. Thus, it was difficult to predict who would win.&#xA0;</span><span>On the gambling sites, the dividends for who would win were quiet even, while users who wanted to fight were waiting impatiently.</span></p><p><span>As well as the expedition, the orcs of Orcrox were fighting together, causing a lot of confusion.</span></p><p><span>&quot;Let&apos;s see...&quot;</span></p><p><span>Ian&#x2019;s voice trailed off.&#xA0;</span><span>In fact, he couldn&#x2019;t not go.&#xA0;</span><span>He was one of the parties involved in the war, but Ian couldn&#x2019;t tell her that.&#xA0;</span><span>He started stretching inside the fast food restaurant.</span></p><p><span>&quot;Isn&#x2019;t Oppa a ranker now? You aren&#x2019;t still a beginner, are you? A few of my friends are playing it full-time. Tsk tsk. They don&#x2019;t study and play games instead.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;What have you been doing in the meantime?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Yiyu laughed with the straw in her mouth.&#xA0;</span><span>&quot;I will receive a scholarship this semester.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;I&#x2019;m not expecting anything, so you don&#x2019;t have to.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Really.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Just work hard.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Wow, you don&#x2019;t believe your little sister.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;It will be bad if you overdo it.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>The expression of her goal was good, but if she couldn&#x2019;t keep her word after declaring it so badly, she would be the most embarrassed.</span></p><p><span>&quot;Hrmm...&quot;&#xA0;</span><span>Ian looked at Yiyu and smiled as he said, &#x201C;Jung Yiyu.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Huh?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Can you do it?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Haven&#x2019;t I always done well?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Then I&apos;m glad.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Ian nodded.&#xA0;</span><span>As he told Yoo Jaehan, he refrained from playing Elder Lord often and was going to stay away from dangerous events.&#xA0;</span><span>But it didn&#x2019;t help the situation.&#xA0;</span><span>His assimilation rate was still at 100%.</span></p><p><span>The grey god no longer spoke to him, but her words about dying in Elder Lord were still valid.&#xA0;</span><span>He wasn&#x2019;t a game player anymore. His status window had also disappeared. There was no such thing as skill level or item rating.&#xA0;</span><span>The moment he accessed Elder Lord, he became the orc warrior Crockta.</span></p><p><span>&quot;Then once things finish, I should go...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;What? Where? Why?&quot;&#xA0;</span><span>Anxiety filled Yiyu&#x2019;s eyes. </span></p><p><span>Ian shrugged and replied,&#xA0;</span><span>&quot;I was thinking about going on a trip...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Alone?&quot;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Yes.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;I will go too!&quot;</span></p><p><span>&quot;You will?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Ian laughed as he saw Yiyu&#x2019;s excitement.&#xA0;</span><span>There was a battle ahead of him.&#xA0;</span><span>He couldn&#x2019;t step back here. Elder Lord might be a game in the past, but he couldn&#x2019;t escape now that he knew they were alive.</span></p><p><span>He was Crockta.&#xA0;</span><span>Due to that, all the orcs were being threatened.&#xA0;</span><span>He vowed to avoid dangerous situations but he couldn&#x2019;t do so. The moment he joined Elder Lord, he became Crockta and thought like an orc warrior.&#xA0;</span><span>He wanted to consider Yiyu but the moment he became Crockta, living as a warrior became more important than anything else.</span></p><p><span>&quot;I know all about your trip,&#x201D; Yiyu said. </span></p><p><span>Ian was confused.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Huh?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;You aren&#x2019;t going on a trip alone.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Uhh...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Aren&#x2019;t I quick to notice?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Ian rolled his eyes.</span></p><p><span>Yiyu grinned.&#xA0;</span><span>&#x201C;Don&#x2019;t you have a girlfriend?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;...Eh?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Oppa finally got a girlfriend and you&#x2019;re thinking about marriage. So you say that you&#x2019;re going alone. It is great, so I respect Oppa&#x2019;s thoughts. Of course, you should introduce me to your girlfriend.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;No...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Is she perhaps younger than me?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;That...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;I&#x2019;ll still understand. Don&#x2019;t worry about me. I originally do well alone. I don&#x2019;t want you to sacrifice yourself because of me.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Right now, I am sacrificing the value of those hamburgers...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Quiet!&#x201D;&#xA0;</span><span>Ian smiled as Yiyu pointed her finger at him and placed the last piece of hamburger in her mouth.&#xA0;</span><span>&quot;Anyway, Oppa should do whatever you want. Have I ever been in an accident when Oppa wasn&#x2019;t with me? No?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>When Ian was a soldier, she had stayed with some relatives. They weren&#x2019;t relatives with a strong affection for their kin.&#xA0;</span><span>Rather, they were more interested in Ian&#x2019;s money.&#xA0;</span><span>It wasn&#x2019;t a comfortable place, but Yiyu never complained or caused problems. She behaved too well.</span></p><p><span>Ian smiled bitterly.&#xA0;</span><span>He knew. Yiyu had endured some difficult times. People would experienced hardships would become tougher. Yiyu was probably stronger than he knew.</span></p><p><span>&quot;I&apos;m pretty and have a good head, so I live in a comfortable world. Oppa doesn&#x2019;t have to worry about me.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Good head?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Oh, my grades are like this because I don&#x2019;t study! My mind is good.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;I see.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Ian laughed.&#xA0;</span><span>His will had been written since he was a soldier. Between then and now, nothing had changed in the contents of the will.&#xA0;</span><span>Furthermore, he could trust his teacher Baek Hanho.&#xA0;</span><span>Yiyu hadn&#x2019;t known it, but Baek Hanho had kept watch to see if her relatives would harass her.&#xA0;</span><span>He would protect Yiyu if something happened to Ian.</span></p><p><span>&quot;Let&#x2019;s really go on a trip later. Where do you want to go?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;The Maldives!&quot;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Okay. Let&apos;s go.&quot;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Kyah, really?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>This was the most important thing.&#xA0;</span><span>He couldn&#x2019;t die.</span></p><p><span>&quot;When have I ever lied?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Indeed. I acknowledge that.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Ian had always survived. This time would be the same as well. He would become Crockta and defend Orcrox.&#xA0;</span><span>When Crockta held God Slayer, he was confident that he couldn&#x2019;t lose to anyone.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&#xA0;Once this fight ended, he had the feeling that the grey god would appear. Then he would ask her the question he really wanted to ask.</span></p><p><span>***</span></p><p><span>-</span><i><span>Hello.</span></i> <i><span>Thank you to the viewers who have always loved the Undergames Channel.</span></i></p><p><span>-</span><i><span>Today is the day when the battle between the orcs and the expedition will occur.
