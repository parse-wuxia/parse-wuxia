<p><span>Chapter 200 - Dragon and Tiger Cave (TL: i.e. a very dangerous place)</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p><p><span>As they approached the entrance to Orcrox, they saw two orcs in chain armor standing like stone statues. Their blades flashed in the sun.&#xA0;</span><span>The guards found Crockta and laughed. They were laughing but due to the tusks and heinous appearance, their faces seemed evil.</span></p><p><span>&quot;Hey. Are you alive?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>They hadn&#x2019;t changed.&#xA0;</span><span>Crockta stood in front of them.&#xA0;</span><span>He was no longer an apprentice warrior. He returned to Orcrox as a great warrior.</span></p><p><span>&quot;At that time, it didn&#x2019;t seem likely...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;The warrior who shook the continent has returned to Orcrox.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>The guards laughed and Crockta laughed with them.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;You are alive.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Of course. I&#x2019;m not weaker than you.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Crockta bumped fists with the two guards.&#xA0;</span><span>It wasn&#x2019;t enough for Crockta so he hugged them. The orc guards burst out laughing.</span></p><p><span>&quot;Crockta has been doing great things!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;It was great to hear.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;How embarrassing.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Crockta remembered when he first came here.&#xA0;</span><span>At that time, he really hadn&#x2019;t known anything. He thought they were just well-formed NPCs.&#xA0;</span><span>But that wasn&apos;t it.&#xA0;</span><span>The orcs and the orcs of Orcrox lived in the world of Elder Lord, as well as all the warriors who died that day.</span></p><p><span>Grom, Kim Hyunchul who was now in jail, Lenox, Gulda and all the orcs he met crossed his mind.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Anyway, I am glad to see you again.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>The guards laughed with their arms around Crockta&#x2019;s shoulder. Then they looked at Zankus.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;If it isn&#x2019;t Zankus.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;It has been a while.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>There were no orcs who didn&#x2019;t know Zankus, the hunter who penetrated the sun.&#xA0;</span><span>The guards bumped fists with Zankus.</span></p><p><span>&quot;You are unchanged.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span><span>Zankus explained to Crockta&#x2019;s group.&#xA0;</span><span>&#x201C;These guards have been protecting this place longer than Lenox. They were standing here when I first arrived.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Really?&quot;</span></p><p><span>They were very old veterans.</span></p><p><span>Crockta introduced Tiyo and Anor.&#xA0;</span><span>&quot;They are my colleagues.&quot;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;I&#x2019;ve heard the story. Very brave friends.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Tiyo nodded.</span></p><p><span>&quot;Huhu, my reputation has spread</span><i><span> dot</span></i><span>!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Tiyo was several times smaller than an orc, but he was the epitome of a man.&#xA0;</span><span>Tiyo imitated the orcs with the fist bumps, before entering Orcrox.&#xA0;</span><span>There was a stir in Orcrox as soon as Crockta&#x2019;s group appeared.</span></p><p><span>Orcs passing by discovered them and opened their mouths, &#x201C;Crockta and Zankus are together!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;It is an honor to meet you. I am alive!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Welcome back!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Crockta first came to Orcrox as a stupid newcomer.&#xA0;</span><span>Now he became a great warrior who people respected.</span></p><p><span>&quot;It feels like home.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Crockta headed towards the training ground where Hoyt was.&#xA0;</span><span>As he came closer, he could hear the orcs.&#xA0;</span><span>He remembered the old days when he ran around the training ground under Lenox&#x2019;s command.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;First hit! First one! Focus every time you swing! Wield it like it is your life!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Uwaaaaah!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Is that lousy swing the best you can do? Is it? Burochwi!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Nooooooooo!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Then swing again! Don&#x2019;t be afraid to die!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Bul&#x2019;tarrrrrrrrrr&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>It was a familiar voice.&#xA0;</span><span>Hoyt, who was standing in the middle of the training grounds, shouted like Lenox. &#xA0;</span><span>Crockta breathed in deeply and shouted.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Are you alive, Hoyt?!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Everyone stopped for a moment as Crockta&#x2019;s group appeared at the camp.&#xA0;</span><span>Orcs were sparring, swinging their weapons in the air and building strength through push-ups.</span></p><p><span>Hoyt, Orcrox&#x2019;s instructor, just laughed.&#xA0;</span><span>&quot;You came back.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Yes.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>It was Hoyt.&#xA0;</span><span>It was the first time since the battle where Lenox died.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;You are alive. Bul&#x2019;tar!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Bul&#x2019;tar!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Crockta and Hoyt bumped fists and embraced each other.&#xA0;</span><span>It was a meeting of two great warriors.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Is that Crockta?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Just like the rumors, he has a fierce face and a menacing greatsword.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Even orcs felt fear at his appearance!&#xA0;</span><span>In addition, his representative greatsword was much bigger than the rumors. The orcs nodded at the sight of Crockta.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Indeed, the warrior who fought the north and the empire.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>After Crockta finished his greeting with Hoyt, Zankus also extended his fist. They were familiar with each other.</span></p><p><span>&quot;Stop running around and stop by Orcrox often.&#x201D; Hoyt scolded.</span></p><p><span>&quot;Kulkul, a hunter doesn&#x2019;t settle down.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Then it was Tiyo and Anor&#x2019;s turn. Hoyt welcomed Crockta&#x2019;s companions.</span></p><p><span>&#x2018;Magic Bullets Berserker&#x2019; Tiyo and &#x2018;Death&apos;s Ruler&#x2019; Anor were already famous as Crockta&#x2019;s companion.</span></p><p><span>&quot;We haven&#x2019;t met in a long time, so let&#x2019;s have a drink...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Good. Let&#x2019;s go quickly!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;But I don&#x2019;t want these guys to relax.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Hoyt looked around. This was the orc&#x2019;s training ground.&#xA0;</span><span>A place where men were created. He was no less harsh than Lenox.&#xA0;</span><span>Hoyt scanned the area like he was uncomfortable.</span></p><p><span>Crockta went forward,&#xA0;</span><span>&#x201C;Leave it to me.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;You?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;I was once one of them, so I know their minds very well.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>All orcs focused on him as Crockta placed the greatsword on his shoulder.&#xA0;</span><span>He was &#x2018;Northern Conqueror&#x2019; and &#x2018;Empire&#x2019;s Deficit&#x2019; Crockta. He was already a legend. Countless orcs who wanted to be like him flocked to this area.&#xA0;</span><span>In addition, it wasn&#x2019;t just the orcs here.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;That Crockta...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Awesome...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>There were many users who became orcs because of Crockta.&#xA0;</span><span>Ever since the legendary broadcast of Crockta&#x2019;s fight against the empire, the influx of orc users greatly increased. Those who selected the warrior class were present on the training ground.&#xA0;</span><span>Crockta&#x2019;s fans willingly came to the training ground where no one wanted to train before.</span></p><p><span>Crockta threw away their expectations.</span></p><p><span>&quot;Your eyes are cloudy!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Crockta yelled loudly. The sudden rant made everyone&#x2019;s eyes go blank.</span></p><p><span>&quot;The eyes of the weak!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Crockta grinned as he looked over at Hoyt.&#xA0;</span><span>There was a time when he wielded the sword like these people.&#xA0;</span><span>Crockta looked at every one of them.</span></p><p><span>&quot;Can you be a warrior with such weak eyes? It is better to pull such rotten eyes out!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>The orcs in training looked at Crockta with a face filled with complaints. Their pride as an orc was hit.</span></p><p><span>&quot;Is there a problem? Then let&#x2019;s make a bet! If you win the bet, there will be no more training for today! You can go to the pub for a beer and Instructor Hoyt will forgive you!&#x201D;&#xA0;</span><span>Crockta shouted.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>The orcs were shaken.&#xA0;</span><span>It was an opportunity to take a day off from harsh training and drink a cold beer.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;But! If you lose, you will have to sleep here. Train until the sun rises tomorrow!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;L-Late night training?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;That&#x2019;s right.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Ugh..!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>A harsh bet!</span></p><p><span>&quot;Then what is the bet?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Crockta grinned.&#xA0;</span><span>He placed the greatsword on the ground. Crockta raised a hand towards the orcs and gestured.</span></p><p><span>&quot;Come at me all at once. Do whatever it takes. You will win if I fall to the ground once.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;That...!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>In the end, it was a fight.&#xA0;</span><span>The orcs looked at each other.&#xA0;</span><span>They could win based on numbers, but the opponent was Crockta. There was no chance of winning, even with so many people.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;You can&#x2019;t do it? All of you are cowards!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;......!&quot;</span></p><p><span>&quot;I am standing alone without a weapon! Look at you now!&#x201D;&#xA0;</span><span>Crockta moved forward and pointed to the nearest orc.&#xA0;</span><span>&quot;Carrying a blade! Carrying an axe! You are acting like this despite holding a hammer! You aren&#x2019;t orcs. Humans! Elves! Not even dwarves!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Don&#x2019;t insult us!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Insult? Do you feel insulted?&#x201D;&#xA0;</span><span>Crockta grinned.&#xA0;</span><span>&#x201C;Then come.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;......!&quot;</span></p><p><span>The nearest orc snorted. His axe shook before he aimed at Crockta.&#xA0;</span><span>As expected from someone who trained under Hoyt, it was a great blow despite him being an apprentice.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Bul&#x2019;tarrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>However, the opponent was Crockta. The axe didn&#x2019;t reach him. Instead, Crockta&#x2019;s fist hit his abdomen.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Keheok!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>This was just the beginning.&#xA0;</span><span>All the orcs on the training ground ran towards Crockta. A huge cloud of dust rose up as a massive number of orcs ran towards one person, concealing their appearance.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;It is hot.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span><span>Hoyt muttered as he watched the scene.</span></p><p><span>&quot;Hehet, I remember when I fought 17 people in Quantes </span><i><span>dot</span></i><span>!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;This is more like 40-50 than 17...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>There were punching and moaning sounds from all over the place.&#xA0;</span><span>Orcs flew through the air.&#xA0;</span><span>Then after some time had passed, Crockta stood alone.&#xA0;</span><span>He raised his fist and declared, &quot;You are lacking. Very lacking. Insufficient!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>But there were no longer any orcs who could challenge him.&#xA0;</span><span>They moaned while clutching their wounds in pain.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Is it hard? Painful? Nobody cares! Train! Get up and swing your weapon!&quot;&#xA0;</span><span>Crockta kicked the orcs to hurry them up off the ground. The orcs rose to their feet after Crockta&#x2019;s kicks.&#xA0;</span><span>&#x201C;Stand up!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Keok, so painful...!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Training is practical! Will you stop fighting due to pain when going against enemies on the battlefield! Rise! Everything is hard! Nobody cares!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Ugh!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;I will go to drink a cold beer with Instructor Hoyt. You keep training! Kuhahahahat!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>The orcs trembled at Crockta&#x2019;s vicious appearance.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;This is the real Northern Conqueror!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;I&#x2019;m glad that Hoyt is the instructor...&#x201D;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>Zankus shook his head and said, &quot;If that guy were the instructor, he would be an unparalleled demonic teacher compared to Lenox and Hoyt.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;That&apos;s right.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Crockta finished arranging the training grounds and returned to Hoyt with an innocent expression.</span></p><p><span>&quot;Now it is resolved. Kulkulkul!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;......&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Anyway, thanks to Crockta&#x2019;s work, Hoyt could leave his position with a relaxed mind.&#xA0;</span><span>Crockta suddenly stopped before he was about to leave the training ground. There was a stick in a corner of the training ground.</span></p><p><span>All orcs knew what it was.&#xA0;</span><span>The stick where Lenox&#x2019;s helmet had been. After he died, the steel helmet had always been watching the training ground.</span></p><p><span>&quot;Hoyt. I should put the helmet back.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;No. You should continue to use it.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Immediately before the battle against the empire, he had received Lenox&#x2019;s helmet from Simba and Kumarak.&#xA0;</span><span>Crockta had continued carrying Lenox&#x2019;s helmet.</span></p><p><span>&quot;There is more work to do in the future.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span><span>Crockta nodded.</span></p><p><span>The military expedition was on the verge of arriving. &#xA0;</span><span>At that time, Lenox&#x2019;s helmet would cover Crockta&#x2019;s head again.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Where is Kumarak?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;He went out for a walk with Simba, and they will be back soon. Not just that, Anya, Wallachwi and other promising orcs have come.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Promising orcs?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Zankus said with a smile,&#xA0;</span><span>&#x201C;I&#x2019;ve met them. They will be your competitors. They are still immature, but I am looking forward to them.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>The orcs like Zankus had already built their achievements and became legendary, but there would be a new generation like Crockta.</span></p><p><span>&quot;Tiyo and Anor, you are their targets as well, so be ready.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Anor jolted with surprise.&#xA0;</span><span>&#x201C;M-Me?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;There are high-level shooters and necromancers who want to prove they are better than you.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Tiyo burst out laughing. &quot;</span><span>Stupid bastards</span><i><span> dot</span></i><span>! They won&#x2019;t be able to think such a cheeky thing after they taste General</span><i><span> dot</span></i><span>! I want to see it!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Kulkul, you are a very spirited gnome friend.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>They chatted while entering the pub.</span></p><p><span>Crockta&#x2019;s eyes became distant.&#xA0;</span><span>This was the place where he met Gulda and asked for advice about how to become qualified to be a warrior.&#xA0;</span><span>The cheerful warrior Gulda who laughed and talked a lot.&#xA0;</span><span>Even when he was about to die in the dungeon, he didn&#x2019;t lose his sense of humor as he laughed.</span></p><p><span>At that moment.</span></p><p><span>&quot;Kuhalhalhalhalhal!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Suddenly, Crockta heard familiar laughter.&#xA0;</span><span>He doubted his eyes.&#xA0;</span><span>There was an orc warrior resembling Gulda, who had the same laugh.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;That is Gurokchwi, Gulda&#x2019;s son.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Gulda&#x2019;s son...!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Crockta grinned.&#xA0;</span><span>His appearance seemed to awaken Crockta. &#xA0;</span><span>He was an orc warrior. Orc warriors didn&#x2019;t look at the past. He would enjoy this moment, like Gulda&#x2019;s son.</span></p><p><span>&quot;Drink!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>They started drinking beer with the orcs.&#xA0;</span><span>Others soon appeared.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;What? The Crockta from that time has become so big? You&#x2019;ve become a pretty big guy.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Everybody is gathered! Drinking beer without me! Drink! Grrung!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Kuaang!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Within a short time, Anya, Kumarak, Simba and other orcs in Orcrox were gathered.</span></p><p><span>&quot;I&apos;ll drink a beer as well...kuhul...hul!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Wallachwi appeared in front of them and smiled while drinking a beer.&#xA0;</span><span>Anyone who saw this sight would doubt their eyes.&#xA0;</span><span>Here, in a pub in Orcrox, was a gathering of those lauded as legends.</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p><p><a href="www.wuxiaworld.com">Glossary of Common Korean Terms.</a></p><p>Praise the Orc:&#xA0;<a href="docs.google.com">Glossary Link.&#xA0;</a></p><p>Current schedule:&#xA0;There will now be 14 chapters a week, meaning two chapters every day.</p><p>I have also updated my&#xA0;<a href="www.patreon.com">Patreon</a>&#xA0;to reflect my new novels.
