<p><span>Chapter 137 - Mountain of Sabres, Forest of Swords (6)</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p><p><span>Crockta looked up at the night sky.&#xA0;</span><span>It was the eve of the full moon.&#xA0;</span><span>It had been several days since he first gave Kenzo the mission.</span></p><p><span>Tiyo and Anor had finished their sightseeing tour of Quantes and all the preparations were finished.&#xA0;</span><span>They were leaving Quantes tomorrow.&#xA0;</span><span>After leaving Quantes and Maillard, they were thinking of going to the southern part of the continent where Tiyo&#x2019;s father was. It was also the place where the Heaven and Earth Clan was based, and they were one of Crockta&#x2019;s targets.</span></p><p><span>He heard that the Heaven and Earth Clan might be related to his enemy, the Thawing Balhae Clan. Therefore, they would decide on their next move after purchasing information from Maillard&#x2019;s Information Guild.</span></p><p><span>Apart from that, he also didn&#x2019;t like the person called Choi Hansung. Someone needed to put a stop to the war he perpetrated.&#xA0;</span><span>If he refused, Choi Hansung would get to see Crockta&#x2019;s Ogre Slayer.</span></p><p><span>As he thought about the future, he noticed something moving in the darkness.&#xA0;</span><span>Crockta turned his head and said, &quot;You came.&quot;</span></p><p><span>It was Kenzo.</span></p><p><span>Crockta grinned. &#xA0;</span><span>Kenzo&#x2019;s appearance made it obvious as to what he had done.&#xA0;</span><span>Kenzo was covered in blood.&#xA0;</span><span>That wasn&#x2019;t all. Crockta could feel something in him that wasn&#x2019;t there before.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;You have reached the Pinnacle.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Kenzo&apos;s atmosphere was different now. Now that he reached the early realm of the Pinnacle, he couldn&#x2019;t be compared to other high-level users.&#xA0;</span><span>The realm of the Pinnacle was for those who realized the true value of Elder Lord. It was a rating that only a few of the strongest, often called rankers, reached.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Yes, I&#x2019;ve reached the Pinnacle.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Kenzo&apos;s voice was tired.&#xA0;</span><span>He attacked the moneylenders infecting Quantes day and night.&#xA0;</span><span>He didn&#x2019;t bother with tools. He killed them when they were alive, then again when they reconnected. He continued to kill.</span></p><p><span>Due to Kenzo&#x2019;s persistent pursuit, the users eventually gave up and withdrew from Quantes.&#xA0;</span><span>Kenzo lunged a sword in their leaving backs to stop them from ever considering coming back to Quantes.</span></p><p><span>&quot;That wasn&#x2019;t the only realization.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>His emotions had been shaken as he watched the NPCs being persecuted, causing his assimilation rate to rise sharply. Only then was he able to reach the Pinnacle.&#xA0;</span><span>At the same time, he realized something else.</span></p><p><span>He made a decision: if a wicked person ever appeared in front of him, regardless of whether they were an NPC or a user, he would raise his sword.</span></p><p><span>That...</span></p><p><span>They were people.</span></p><p><span>Crockta smiled.&#xA0;</span><span>When Kenzo first said he wanted to help others, Crockta smelled something from him. Kenzo had fulfilled Crockta&#x2019;s expectations.&#xA0;</span><span>Now he would do what he believed.</span></p><p><span>Crockta asked, &quot;Yes, did I help you?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Kenzo bowed his head and replied, &#x201C;Yes. It is thanks to Crockta.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Then listen to my condition.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Of course.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>If he reached this ground, he was supposed to listen to what Crockta wanted.&#xA0;</span><span>Kenzo was nervous.&#xA0;</span><span>He didn&#x2019;t know what the condition would be. Crockta said it would be within a capable range, but it was still ambiguous. Maybe he would be faced with a difficult request.&#xA0;</span><span>However, he also believed in Crockta.</span></p><p><span>&quot;My request is simple.&quot;</span></p><p><span>Crockta moved Ogre Slayer.&#xA0;</span><span>Kenzo also glanced at his claymore.&#xA0;</span><span>What did he want to do?</span></p><p><span>Crockta slowly moved his greatsword.&#xA0;</span><span>It was slow.&#xA0;</span><span>It wasn&#x2019;t the realm of the Pinnacle, but there was no shaking.&#xA0;</span><span>Crockta&#x2019;s blade moved on a gentle curve. Kenzo watched from a distance.</span></p><p><span>He didn&#x2019;t move.&#xA0;</span><span>At that moment.&#xA0;</span><span>The blade touched his neck.</span></p><p><span>&quot;......!&quot;</span></p><p><span>It was impossible.&#xA0;</span><span>It was minor, but Kenzo got goose bumps as he realized the meaning.&#xA0;</span><span>It was an attack beyond the level of speed.&#xA0;</span><span>An area that he couldn&#x2019;t reach.&#xA0;</span><span>It was the realm of miracles.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;This...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;The next stage after the Pinnacle.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;......!&quot;</span></p><p><span>&quot;It means that the Pinnacle isn&#x2019;t the end.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>After reaching the realm of the Pinnacle, he knew that there was &#x2018;something more.&#x2019; But this couldn&#x2019;t even be called that.&#xA0;</span><span>The word &#x2018;impossible&#x2019; was all he could think.</span></p><p><span>&quot;Now I will tell you what I want.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>It wasn&#x2019;t the end.&#xA0;</span><span>Kenzo once again shook after hearing Crockta&#x2019;sn next words.</span></p><p><span>&quot;Do some good with that strength.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>It was an unimaginable demand.&#xA0;</span><span>Kenzo realized that Crockta was a much bigger man than he thought.&#xA0;</span><span>Kenzo nodded. It felt like Crockta&#x2019;s eyes were penetrating inside him.&#xA0;</span><span>Did Crockta know that Kenzo would stand in front of him with this mindset after taking care of the moneylenders?</span></p><p><span>Kenzo bowed his head.&#xA0;</span><span>He could only say one thing, &quot;I understand.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>For him, Crockta wasn&#x2019;t simply a person in the game.&#xA0;</span><span>He was someone with a great spirit.</span></p><p><span>Kenzo said, &quot;I will pass your teachings onto other people. The realm of the Pinnacle, and what to use it for. Will you also let them know it?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Of course.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Kenzo would gather people.&#xA0;</span><span>There were a variety of ways to play the game.&#xA0;</span><span>There would be those who harassed NPCs for profit.&#xA0;</span><span>That was the way they played.&#xA0;</span><span>Therefore, they needed to take care of such villains.&#xA0;</span><span>They would be good for NPCs and bad for users.</span></p><p><span>What was this? Anyway, a hero needed to have a coexistence of darkness and light.</span></p><p><span>&quot;Please make a name for the group,&#x201D; Kenzo requested.&#xA0;</span><span>He wanted a name from Crockta. If they were to follow him, it seemed right that he give them a name.</span></p><p><span>&quot;The road that Kenzo walks will be long and full of blades. The path of pandemonium that not everyone can walk!&#x201D;&#xA0;</span><span>Crockta declared, &quot;With that type of mindset, I will call it Mountain of Sabres, Forest of Swords.</span></p><p><span>&quot;Mountain of Sabres, Forest of Swords!&quot;</span></p><p><span>A cool name.&#xA0;</span><span>The words were true. Last night, he had gone through the moneylenders.&#xA0;</span><span>In the place where the moneylenders turned into white particles, only their weapons and equipment were left behind.</span></p><p><span>It really was a mountain of sabres, a forest of swords.</span></p><p><span>&quot;Those who follow you will be part of a Mountain of Sabres, Forest of Swords.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Kenzo looked at the red headband around Crockta&#x2019;s forehead.&#xA0;</span><span>The red headband would be their symbol.&#xA0;</span><span>This was the beginning of &#x2018;Mountain of Sabres, Forest of Swords&#x2019;, following &#x2018;Rehabilitation Brothers&#x2019; and &#x2018;He&#x2019;s an Orc, yet still Praiseworthy.&#x2019;&#xA0;</span><span>Unfortunately, the name &#x2018;Mountain of Sabres, Forest of Swords&#x2019; was unknown to most people.</span></p><p><span>The red headband was so intense that people just called them &#x2018;Red Headband&#x2019;...</span></p><p></p><p style="text-align: center"><span>***</span></p><p></p><p><span>&quot;Did something good happen </span><i><span>dot</span></i><span>?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Kulkulkul. No. Kulkul.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Anor and Tiyo stared at the laughing Crockta.&#xA0;</span><span>They were leaving Quantes and heading to Maillard. They planned to go through there towards the cities in the south.&#xA0;</span><span>The party was riding the caruks that they obtained from the north.&#xA0;</span><span>The caruks were slower than horses, but they had good endure and physical strength. They moved well even when carrying someone of Crockta&#x2019;s size.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Look at your expression. Tell me quickly. I want to know the good thing.&quot;</span></p><p><span>&quot;It is really nothing.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Then why do you look so bright?&#x201D;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>Crockta was thinking about his meeting with Kenzo before leaving Quantes.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Kulkul.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Kenzo had punished the moneylenders brilliantly. Furthermore, he even reached the Pinnacle.&#xA0;</span><span>Then he declared that he would make a group to follow Crockta.&#xA0;</span><span>The name was Mountain of Sabres, Forest of Swords!</span></p><p><span>Crockta hadn&#x2019;t done much, but it was pleasing to see, just like a filial child.&#xA0;</span><span>Now the name of Crockta would once again shake the world.&#xA0;</span><span>If he logged out at this time, he could see what his fanclub &#x2018;He&#x2019;s an Orc, yet still Praiseworthy&#x2019; was doing.</span></p><p><span>The fame that everyone desired!&#xA0;</span><span>It was healing.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;It is difficult to be famous. Kulkulkul!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>He wondered if he would be stalked by some fans. Crockta worried about this alone.</span></p><p><span>&quot;I don&#x2019;t know what it is but...&#x201D;&#xA0;</span><span>Anor shook his head.</span></p><p><span>They rode steadily on the caruks and soon saw the sign for Maillard. They would soon arrive.</span></p><p><span>Maillard was a place containing the Information Guild and where Stella worked at the Blacksmith Company. In addition, there was the legend of the &#x2018;Rehabilitation Brothers&#x2019; who rehabilitated problematic users.</span></p><p><span>Crockta recalled his old memories and drove the caruk quickly.&#xA0;</span><span>Suddenly, they were able to see a group of people.&#xA0;</span><span>Their eyes met Crockta&#x2019;s party. Crockta greeted them respectfully first.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Hello. I am alive.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;...Ah, yes.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>They gazed at Crockta, then checked Tiyo and Anor&#x2019;s foreheads before looking unimpressed.&#xA0;</span><span>They were users.&#xA0;</span><span>Users didn&#x2019;t have much interest in NPCs. In particular, they were users on par with NPCs.&#xA0;</span><span>As the level of the users increased, they became more arrogant.</span></p><p><span>&quot;They have a very cheap way of greeting peopled </span><i><span>dot</span></i><span>,&#x201D; Tiyo muttered.&#xA0;</span><span>He talked to himself but everyone could hear him. The eyes of the users turned to him. Tiyo just shrugged.</span></p><p><span>The atmosphere became slightly tense.&#xA0;</span><span>However, both sides didn&#x2019;t do anything else so there wasn&#x2019;t a conflict.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Put up with it. He looks like a kid.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Have you see them? I can&#x2019;t wait to catch those GB bastards.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Wait and watch. Stay still until we get instructions from Brother.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Crockta heard their conversation.&#xA0;</span><span>They said &#x2018;GB&#x2019;, which was the abbreviation for Rehabilitation Brothers.&#xA0;</span><span>It looked like a group that wasn&#x2019;t on good terms with them.</span></p><p><span>&quot;Hrmm...&quot;</span></p><p></p><p style="text-align: center"><span>***</span></p><p></p><p><span>Crockta&#x2019;s group continued until they reached Maillard.&#xA0;</span><span>They were able to reach Maillard, the great and beautiful city of the elves.</span></p><p><span>Anor&#x2019;s eyes widened.&#xA0;</span><span>If Quantes was a city built with the technical skills of the gnomes, Maillard was a large elf city.&#xA0;</span><span>The buildings were in harmony with nature, and the form was so beautiful that it felt perfectly with Anor&#x2019;s dark elf sensibilities. It was truly a city of elves, the cradle of elf users.</span></p><p><span>Anor wandered around with wide eyes and couldn&#x2019;t take his eyes off Maillard.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Isn&#x2019;t it cool?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Really great. Wow...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Bah, this is nothing compared to Quantes.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>They were able to easily enter because Maillard didn&#x2019;t have any restrictions on access.&#xA0;</span><span>He was planning to leave after finding the Information Guild and Stella, so they weren&#x2019;t going to stay long.&#xA0;</span><span>But the atmosphere inside was strange.</span></p><p><span>To be exact, it was the atmosphere among the users.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;......?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Crockta was confused.&#xA0;</span><span>The Maillard citizens were still the same. As inhabitants of Elder Lord, they were living their own lives.</span></p><p><span>By the way, the users with white stars on their foreheads were looking around and watching something.&#xA0;</span><span>They were holding their weapons and seemed prepared to fight at any time. Some users stared at each other in a confrontational manner when passing by.&#xA0;</span><span>A tight tension could be felt between the users.</span></p><p><span>&quot;Interesting,&#x201D; Crockta muttered.</span></p><p><span>What was happening in Maillard?</span></p><p><span>&quot;We will stay here tonight. Look around and come back again.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;I understand </span><i><span>dot</span></i><span>.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;I&#x2019;ll go explore!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Wait, let&#x2019;s go together </span><i><span>dot</span></i><span>!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Crockta headed towards the Information Guild first.&#xA0;</span><span>He headed towards the darker part of the city, towards the streets lined with shabby pubs.&#xA0;</span><span>He was coming back.&#xA0;</span><span>It was the place where there were real men.&#xA0;</span><span>The headquarters of Maillard&#x2019;s Information Guild.</span></p><p><span>&quot;Kulkulkul, it is still a beautiful inverted triangle.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Crockta muttered as he looked at the sign for the pub.&#xA0;</span><span>It was right there.&#xA0;</span><span>The &#x2018;Where are my Brothers?&#x2019; pub!</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p><p><a href="www.wuxiaworld.com">Glossary of Common Korean Terms.</a></p><p>Praise the Orc:&#xA0;<a href="docs.google.com">Glossary Link.&#xA0;</a></p><p>Current schedule:&#xA0;There will now be 14 chapters a week, meaning two chapters every day.</p><p>I have also updated my&#xA0;<a href="www.patreon.com">Patreon</a>&#xA0;to reflect my new novels.
