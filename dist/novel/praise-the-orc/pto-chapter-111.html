<p><span>Chapter 111 - Great Northern War (7)</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p><p><span>Crockta looked at the sky from the pumpkin carriage.&#xA0;</span><span>It was the end of the lunar cycle. The thin moon made him the most sensitive. Darkness distracted the enemy&#x2019;s vision and hid his stature.</span></p><p><span>He just needed his greatsword.</span></p><p><span>He was currently floating above the tent of the great chieftain, Calmahart.&#xA0;</span><span>But the area still hadn&#x2019;t calmed down. Orcs were carrying food into Calmahart&#x2019;s tent. They were carrying an enormous amount of meat.&#xA0;</span><span>Calmahart&#x2019;s overeating was good for Crockta. Digesting a lot of food required energy, so it inevitably made the brain sleepy. The body would become dull and dull bodies created gaps in battle.</span></p><p><span>&quot;Not bad.&quot;</span></p><p><span>Once the orcs fell asleep, Crockta would descend from the carriage and hit Calmahart.&#xA0;</span><span>The night was still young.</span></p><p><span>The next space time movement of this pumpkin was at midnight. He still had some time.&#xA0;</span><span>Crockta touched the surface of the pumpkin carriage. It was really a pumpkin and a pegasus made of translucent light pulled it.</span></p><p><span>It was summoned by Jamero&#x2019;s &#x2018;Boundary Pumpkin.&#x2019;&#xA0;</span><span>He used it and a pumpkin carriage suddenly appeared.&#xA0;</span><span>It was a carriage that only appeared in Crockta&#x2019;s eyes and allowed him to infiltrate wherever he wanted without a sound.&#xA0;</span><span>If there wasn&#x2019;t a restriction that only one person could use it, perhaps he would&#x2019;ve been able to pull off a greater surprise attack.</span></p><p><span>Crockta carefully searched below.</span></p><p><span>It was a large army.&#xA0;</span><span>It was the spectacular sight of many orcs camping together.&#xA0;</span><span>If all those orcs appeared in the north, it would be impossible for the dark elves to handle them.&#xA0;</span><span>Crockta reinforced how important this opportunity was.&#xA0;</span><span>If he stabbed Calmahart in the heart here, maybe the war would be over. The origin of all this was Calmahart.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;One, two, three.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>He confirmed the number of guards around Calmahart&#x2019;s tent. There weren&#x2019;t many due to Calmahart&#x2019;s &#xA0;confidence.&#xA0;</span><span>Warriors on patrol sometimes roamed, but overall, the defense was lax. They didn&#x2019;t expect a surprise attack at all.</span></p><p><span>Of course, they were right.&#xA0;</span><span>If it weren&#x2019;t for this mysterious artifact, Crockta would&#x2019;ve never reached here.&#xA0;</span><span>It was a one person raid.</span></p><p><span>The moon went behind a cloud.&#xA0;</span><span>There was perfect darkness on the plains.&#xA0;</span><span>The pumpkin started to descend gradually, according to Crockta&#x2019;s will. Gradually, the campsite of the orcs came closer.</span></p><p><span>He occasionally heard the steps of the orc soldiers walking around.&#xA0;</span><span>Crockta quietly added his own footsteps to the sounds.&#xA0;</span><span>There was an orc soldier with his back to Crockta.</span></p><p><i><span>Step.</span></i></p><p><span>Suddenly, the orc soldier looked around.</span></p><p><i><span>Spit.</span></i></p><p><i><span>Patter.</span></i></p><p><span>Blood spattered as the orc&#x2019;s head turned around.&#xA0;</span><span>Crockta caught the falling head and eliminated the sound of impact. Once again, blood poured on him.</span></p><p><span>Then silence.</span></p><p><i><span>Step.</span></i></p><p><span>Crockta walked forward.&#xA0;</span><span>There were three guards around at the tent. Crockta moved behind them in the darkness.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;I&#x2019;m tired,&#x201D; an orc muttered while yawning. </span></p><p><span>He had a halberd tied to his back.&#xA0;</span><span>He never noticed as Crockta secretly approached.</span></p><p><span>[The skill Infiltration (Common) has been acquired.]</span></p><p><span>[You seem to be getting used to sneaking around? Your Infiltration skill has upgraded.]</span></p><p><span>[Shadow Infiltration (Rare) has been acquired.]</span></p><p><span>He shut the message windows off.&#xA0;</span><span>Then in the same manner, he cut the neck of the orc from behind.</span></p><p><span>&quot;......!&quot;</span></p><p><span>The orc responded.&#xA0;</span><span>He felt something and quickly twisted. However, he couldn&#x2019;t avoid it and most of his neck was cut.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Kuheeok...!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>His throat was cut and he couldn&#x2019;t shout properly.&#xA0;</span><span>The orc looked up at Crockta with surprised eyes. Gradually, bubbles rose and the eyes became blurred.&#xA0;</span><span>Crockta used his greatsword to completely separate the dangling head.</span></p><p><span>The orc&#x2019;s eyes died.&#xA0;</span><span>Now there was only one left.&#xA0;</span><span>The remaining orc was completely asleep.&#xA0;</span><span>Crockta didn&#x2019;t bother using the greatsword. Instead, he reached out his hands to the orc&#x2019;s neck and twisted.</span></p><p><i><span>Crunch.</span></i></p><p><span>The orc still seemed to be sleeping. There would&#x2019;ve been no pain.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Now it is starting.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Crockta muttered in a small voice.&#xA0;</span><span>He stood directly before Calmahart&#x2019;s tent. Such a large tent was being used by only one person. It was as big as a building.&#xA0;</span><span>The opponent wasn&#x2019;t easy, but Crockta wasn&#x2019;t an ordinary orc.</span></p><p><span>His greatsword was crying. Crockta smiled.</span></p><p><span>Then he took out a scroll and tore it.</span></p><p><span>[Wide Area Silence Scroll (Essence) has been consumed.]</span></p><p><span>He barely sensed it. It was like the invisible membrane enveloping the area. Now no sound would leak out.</span></p><p><span>Crockta opened the tent.</span></p><p></p><p style="text-align: center"><span>***</span></p><p></p><p><span>The interior was bright.</span></p><p><span>There was a fire blazing in the middle of the tent. One side contained fearsome weapons such as axes, hammers, and halberds, while the other side had a tactical map showing the current march of the orcs.</span></p><p><span>Crockta skimmed it. It wasn&#x2019;t significantly different from what the dark elves had figured out.&#xA0;</span><span>At the end, there was a huge mass lying on the bed.</span></p><p><span>Calmahart.&#xA0;</span><span>He was lying beside a huge throne decorated with all types of bones. Just looking at him from a distance, Crockta could guess his size.&#xA0;</span><span>Crockta felt sick and tired.&#xA0;</span><span>That really was an orc.&#xA0;</span><span>He seemed one head bigger than Crockta.&#xA0;</span><span>There was an axe under the bed. It was a huge double edged axe that seemed to be his main weapon.</span></p><p><span>Crockta approached.&#xA0;</span><span>Calmahart hadn&#x2019;t noticed anything yet as his breathing was still the same. His face twisted as if he was doing something terrible in his dreams.</span></p><p><span>Crockta pulled out his greatsword.&#xA0;</span><span>He hadn&#x2019;t come here to fight or play around.</span></p><p><span>This was an assassination.&#xA0;</span><span>The sword descended.&#xA0;</span><span>It was at that moment.</span></p><p><i><span>Kakang!</span></i></p><p><span>Calmahart raised his arm.&#xA0;</span><span>He was wearing a steel guard on his forearm. It blocked Crockta&#x2019;s greatsword.</span></p><p><span>Calmahart&#x2019;s eyes tinged red.&#xA0;</span><span>He laughed.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Hoh.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Crockta stepped back.&#xA0;</span><span>It had been just a hair away.&#xA0;</span><span>How was he noticed?</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;It is the first time that I&#x2019;ve seen you. I would remember someone with tattoos.&quot;&#xA0;</span><span>Calmahart got up.</span></p><p><span>His huge body looked down at Crockta. His head seemed to reach the top of the tent.&#xA0;</span><span>He grabbed his double edged axe.&#xA0;</span><span>It was a huge weapon that wasn&#x2019;t inferior to Crockta&#x2019;s Ogre Slayer.</span></p><p><span>Calmahart looked down at Crockta. His expression was interested. His arms were trembling because he wanted to wield the double edged axe right away.&#xA0;</span><span>Crockta caught his breath calmly.</span></p><p><span>This had developed into a fight.&#xA0;</span><span>He lifted Ogre Slayer.&#xA0;</span><span>Anyway, he had been expecting this.</span></p><p><span>Crockta grinned.</span></p><p><span>Calmahart and Crockta, the two orcs stood facing each other.&#xA0;</span><span>Then their worlds slowed.&#xA0;</span><span>Extremely keen senses.&#xA0;</span><span>A sudden exchange of attack and defense occurred in a short amount of time.&#xA0;</span><span>Ogre Slayer and the axe hit each other.</span></p><p><i><span>Kakakaang!</span></i></p><p><span>&quot;Kuhuhu...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Kulkulkul.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>The two looked at each other and laughed.&#xA0;</span><span>And at the same time.</span></p><p><span>Strong.&#xA0;</span><span>With that exchange, they were able to gauge the other person&#x2019;s level.</span></p><p><span>Crockta plunged in. He aimed the sword at Calmahart&#x2019;s lower body. At the same time, Calmahart&#x2019;s axe lowered.&#xA0;</span><span>Crockta twisted his body to avoid the axe and corrected the sword&#x2019;s trajectory.&#xA0;</span><span>The blade swung into Calmahart&#x2019;s abdomen. Ogre Slayer bounced off.</span></p><p><i><span>Kakang!</span></i></p><p><span>&quot;Kuhuhu...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Calmahart grinned. He was wearing steel armor on the inside.</span></p><p><span>&quot;Shall we do it properly?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>He stretched his back. Then he approached Crockta.&#xA0;</span><span>Crockta nodded.</span></p><p><span>&quot;Yes, let&#x2019;s do it right.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>At the same time, huge momentum burst out from their bodies. A storm raged into the tent.&#xA0;</span><span>The two of them grinned at each other. Then they fought again.&#xA0;</span><span>At a speed that wasn&#x2019;t visible, they aimed their weapons at the other&#x2019;s neck and heart.</span></p><p><span>Tremendously loud sounds like a thunderstorm occurred. Crockta became bruised while blood flowed from Calmahart&#x2019;s body.</span></p><p><i><span>Kakang!</span></i></p><p><span>Once again, their weapons collided. The power struggle continued.&#xA0;</span><span>Crockta kicked Calmahart&#x2019;s legs.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Kuhuk!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Calmahart fell over, causing the tent to shake fiercely.&#xA0;</span><span>Crockta jumped forward and aimed his greatsword downwards. Calmahart hit the greatsword with the axe and grabbed Crockta&#x2019;s neck with the other hand.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Kuock...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>There was a strong grip on his neck. Crockta struggled. Calmahart smiled and gave more strength to his hands.&#xA0;</span><span>It was a tremendous force.&#xA0;</span><span>Crockta grabbed the wrist and tried to pull it away, but it didn&#x2019;t move.</span></p><p><span>Then Crockta bit the hand with a wicked expression.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Kuaack!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Calmahart screamed and let go. One finger was tattered.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;You...!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Crockta smiled and spat out the blood.&#xA0;</span><span>&#x201C;There isn&#x2019;t much taste.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Calmahart&#x2019;s eyes turned red with anger as he laughed.&#xA0;</span><span>&#x201C;Kuhuhuhuk, kuhuhut!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>This guy was for real.&#xA0;</span><span>He was someone who knew how to really fight.</span></p><p><span>Calmahart&#x2019;s mouth rose.&#xA0;</span><span>A warrior like himself, who knew what slaughter and fighting for their lives were.&#xA0;</span><span>This guy knew.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;What is your name?&#x201D; Calmahart asked.</span></p><p><span>Crockta placed the greatsword on his shoulder.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Crockta.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;I see. You...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Calmahart remembered what happened earlier in the day.</span></p><p><span>A real orc.&#xA0;</span><span>Calmahart laughed.&#xA0;</span><span>A real warrior would appear and kill him.&#xA0;</span><span>The name was Crockta.&#xA0;</span><span>An orc who was stronger and larger than average orcs. His eyes were deep and sharp. He wore a red headband and steel belt at his waist. The big greatsword used as a weapon.</span></p><p><span>Strong.&#xA0;</span><span>An orc who reached the same &#x2018;stage&#x2019; as him.</span></p><p><span>And...</span></p><p><span>That was all.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;You are a real orc...?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Crockta laughed.&#xA0;</span><span>He had also seen what happened during the day.</span></p><p><span>&quot;What is a real orc, Calmahart?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Calmahart raised his axe.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Strong.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span><span>The axe contained a fearsome momentum. His muscles swelled up. The originally large body became even bigger.&#xA0;</span><span>&quot;Stronger than anyone else. That is an orc.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>He approached Crockta, who pulled out his greatsword.</span></p><p><span>&quot;And I am the strongest,&#x201D; declared Calmahart.</span></p><p><span>At the same time, the axe lowered.</span></p><p><i><span>Swaaaack!</span></i></p><p><span>Space was severed.&#xA0;</span><span>Crockta&#x2019;s eyes changed. It was an unusual attack. Crockta immediately moved to the side to avoid it.</span></p><p><i><span>Kaaaang!</span></i></p><p><span>The axe struck a part of the skull protruding from his belt.&#xA0;</span><span>Crockta lost his balance in the aftermath and fell to one knee. He rolled to avoid the next strike from the axe.</span></p><p><span>&quot;......!&quot;</span></p><p><span>The Demon&#x2019;s Mouth was scratched.&#xA0;</span><span>This was the first time.</span></p><p><span>He raised his head. The axe was coming in succession.&#xA0;</span><span>Instead of stepping back, Crockta bowed his head and moved forward.&#xA0;</span><span>The axe passed over Crockta&#x2019;s head. The oversized Calmahart was bent down low and defenseless against Crockta&#x2019;s incoming rush.</span></p><p><span>Crockta aimed his greatsword.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Kuheok!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Blood emerged from Calmahart&#x2019;s mouth.&#xA0;</span><span>Crockta twisted his greatsword.&#xA0;</span><span>But the handle didn&#x2019;t move.</span></p><p><span>&quot;......!&quot;</span></p><p><span>Calmahart&#x2019;s abdominal muscles held on to the blade.</span></p><p><span>He couldn&#x2019;t believe it.&#xA0;</span><span>Crockta raised his head. Calmahart was smiling as he looked down at Crockta.</span></p><p><span>&quot;I got you.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Calmahart threw the axe away and grabbed Crockta&#x2019;s neck with both hands.&#xA0;</span><span>Crockta desperately pulled his greatsword but it didn&#x2019;t budge.&#xA0;</span><span>What a monstrous body.</span></p><p><span>Calmahart laughed. Crockta&#x2019;s eyes became blurry as he looked up into Calmahart&#x2019;s face.</span></p><p><span>&quot;......!&quot;</span></p><p><span>Calmahart&#x2019;s grip became stronger.&#xA0;</span><span>His consciousness faded.</span></p><p><span>Then he saw something shimmering on Calmahart&#x2019;s forehead.</span></p><p><span>His consciousness went to a distant place.</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p><p><a href="www.wuxiaworld.com">Glossary of Common Korean Terms.</a></p><p>Praise the Orc:&#xA0;<a href="docs.google.com">Glossary Link.&#xA0;</a></p><p>Current schedule:&#xA0;<strong>Next Patreon goal has been reached!!
