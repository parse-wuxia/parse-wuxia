<p><span>Chapter 18 - Warrior&#x2019;s Qualifications (2)</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p><p><span>A goblin stood in front of Grom.&#xA0;</span><span>It had a small body, and a grumpy face that displayed an angry expression as it threw a stone at Grom.</span></p><p><span>&quot;Ouch!&quot;</span></p><p><span>The rock hit his shin and Grom jumped, grabbing his leg in pain.&#xA0;</span><span>The goblin started throwing stones even harder.</span></p><p><span>&quot;This bastard!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Grom raised his axe and ran towards the goblin.&#xA0;</span><span>The goblin rushed away quickly. In the meantime, he kept throwing dirt and rocks back at Grom.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Wait there!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>The goblin hid behind some thick bushes.&#xA0;</span><span>Grom jumped over the bushes.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Got you...!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>As Grom landed on the ground, goblins surrounded him.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Kyahahak! Kyak!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Kyah! Kyak!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>The goblins no longer held rocks.&#xA0;</span><span>They held things like blunt axes, rusty swords, spears, and other weapons that seemed to have been stolen.</span></p><p><span>The goblin who lured Grom into the crowd shot a nasty smile at him and threw a rock again.&#xA0;</span><span>Grom was hit in the head and fell over. Detestable. Really detestable. He wanted to rush over and give it a good thrashing, but he was outnumbered. It was a group of goblins with over a dozen people.</span></p><p><span>Grom fell back.</span></p><p><i><span>Thud, thud.</span></i></p><p><span>Someone touched Grom&#x2019;s back.&#xA0;</span><span>He turned around to see a goblin holding a handaxe. He laughed. His rear was also dominated by goblins.</span></p><p><span>Grom laughed awkwardly, &#x201C;...Kulkul.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Grom was now able to laugh like an orc.&#xA0;</span><span>However, he looked a bit subservient.</span></p><p><span>The goblin raised his axe and started a slicing motion towards Grom&#x2019;s neck. His head would be cut off now if he didn&#x2019;t run away. As the goblin smiled mockingly, Grom felt a sense of d&#xE9;j&#xE0; vu.</span></p><p><span>Something boiled up inside him.&#xA0;</span><span>He was angry.&#xA0;</span><span>It was really detestable.&#xA0;</span><span>Yes, this emotion, it was like when someone told him off for being too loud in an Internet cafe.&#xA0;</span><span>It felt like that time, when he hit the reset button and ran away.</span></p><p><span>Grom&apos;s axe flashed.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Keeeeek!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>The goblin&#x2019;s head was split apart.</span></p><p><span>&quot;These kids&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>The goblins were astonished and simultaneously rushed towards Grom.&#xA0;</span><span>Grom wielded his axe.&#xA0;</span><span>There were goblins everywhere.&#xA0;</span><span>He spun the axe around and around in order to survive. The goblins didn&#x2019;t dare approach the wildly spinning axe and retreated.</span></p><p><span>It was his last hurrah, but it worked!</span></p><p><span>Grom shouted as old memories flashed through his head.</span></p><p><span>&quot;Whirlwind&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Then messages popped up.</span></p><p><span>[Congratulations!]</span></p><p><span>[You struggled to survive and have learned an hidden axe technique!]</span></p><p><span>[You are like a terrible trolley car that spins round and round, destroying everything around you in its wake, no matter what!]</span></p><p><span>[This is an attack that enemies can&#x2019;t deal with!]</span></p><p><span>[All enemies will be unconditionally killed!]</span></p><p><span>[A terrible massacre, a feast of blood is anticipated!]</span></p><p><span>[The wild attack that will decimate everything!]</span></p><p><span>Oh my god!&#xA0;</span><span>Grom&#x2019;s expression brightened.</span></p><p><span>It was clear.&#xA0;</span><span>A hidden piece.&#xA0;</span><span>This was a hidden piece of Elder Lord, a hidden skill!</span></p><p><span>[Overwhelming Assault (Common) has been acquired!]</span></p><p><span>Grom wobbled.</span></p><p><span>The name was cool, but it was just an ordinary Common grade skill.&#xA0;</span><span>As soon as he lost balance, the goblins charged towards Grom.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Keook!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>He rolled and avoided their attacks, but his skull was soon smashed by a goblin&#x2019;s stone hammer. His head started spinning. He could see goblins raising their weapons out of the corner of his eye.</span></p><p><span>This would be his first death since becoming an orc.&#xA0;</span><span>Grom closed his eyes.</span></p><p><span>At that moment, the earth started to shake.</span></p><p><span>The goblins flinched.&#xA0;</span><span>A thunderous sound hit their ears.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Bul&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Tarrrrrrrr&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Grom opened his eyes.&#xA0;</span><span>10 orc warriors came rushing like crazy.&#xA0;</span><span>Their broad shoulders made it seem like they numbered in the dozens, or in the hundreds. They were like a runaway train as they swept through the goblins. The goblins&#x2019; bodies flew through the air.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Kyaaaaak!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Kyak!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Kieeeek!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>The goblins started screaming and crying.&#xA0;</span><span>With one assault, dozens of goblins were torn into rags.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Keooook!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Grom shrieked.</span></p><p><span>The orc warriors didn&#x2019;t care as Grom fell down.</span></p><p><span>[You are in critical condition!]</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;......&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Grom slumped down.</span></p><p><span>The fight was over in a flash.&#xA0;</span><span>The goblins were twitching on the ground. The orc warriors killed those goblins without mercy.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Apprentice! Where are you? Are you alive?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Euh....&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Grom got up.&#xA0;</span><span>The faces of the warriors were visible.&#xA0;</span><span>All of them looked fearsome. Their faces and bodies were full of tattoos, and they were covered with blood. &#xA0;They had relaxed gestures and an imposing walk!</span></p><p><span>The real warriors recognized by Lenox!&#xA0;</span><span>The warriors who found Grom laughed out loud, &#x201C;Kulkulkulkul! You&#x2019;re alive, Apprentice! Wonderful!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;You lured the goblins very well! Great talent!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Pushovers who see other pushovers would want to catch them!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;The goblins truly have discerning eyes! They judged perfectly! They are perfect at judging pushovers! Kuhahahah!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>That&#x2019;s right.&#xA0;</span><span>Grom had been acting as the pushover, or bait, all day.</span></p><p><span>The goblins were very wary of orcs, but once they saw Grom, they would provoke him and pull him into a large crowd.&#xA0;</span><span>Then the orc warriors would rush in to slaughter the group.</span></p><p><span>As the bait, Grom had suffered and almost died many times. The goblins were too much, and he could barely resist for a minute every time. Then, once Grom was surrounded, the orc warriors would charge in and sweep up the goblins.</span></p><p><span>This had happened several times already. The goblins would wither away due to the orc warriors from Orcrox Fortress.</span></p><p><span>The warriors urged Grom to hurry.</span></p><p><span>&quot;Then, I&#x2019;ll ask you to prepare new goblins again, Apprentice!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Grom shook his head.</span></p><p><span>&quot;Warriors, I think it will be hard now.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;What do you mean?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Goblins are also intelligent monsters! At this point, they might&#x2019;ve noticed your strategy.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Hrmm.&quot;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Besides, I have grown in the battles. I am different from before, I have become stronger. The goblins won&#x2019;t be able to easily mess with me. They have eyes!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>That&#x2019;s right.&#xA0;</span><span>Grom had fought with the warriors. Although he almost died several times, he was able to accumulate skill proficiency and achievement points.&#xA0;</span><span>Furthermore, he had gained the Overwhelming Assault (Common) skill.&#xA0;</span><span>The goblins wouldn&#x2019;t be able to defeat Grom, who was more powerful.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;That makes sense.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Yes! That&apos;s right.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;But we don&#x2019;t know if we don&#x2019;t try one more time.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;I understand. However, it is a waste of time.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Grom walked through the forest with the warriors behind him.&#xA0;</span><span>He was different from before.&#xA0;</span><span>He puffed out his chest and showed the attitude of a warrior. Now, Grom was a warrior who stood among the orcs!&#xA0;</span><span>He was still an apprentice, but the goblins couldn&#x2019;t come near him...</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Keek! Keek!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>A goblin appeared before his thought finished!</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Keek! Keeek!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Grom felt resigned.&#xA0;</span><span>The two goblins circled around Grom. They exchanged glances.&#xA0;</span><span>Grom was able to guess their meaning.</span></p><p><span>Pushover!&#xA0;</span><span>A pushover!</span></p><p><span>Resignation became anger.&#xA0;</span><span>Grom cried out as anger rose in his body. His temper blazed fiercely towards the goblins.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;These guys&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>It was the skill Overwhelming Assault!</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Kyakak, kyaack?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Kek? Keehek?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Why did a pushover suddenly become like this? Let&apos;s see? Was it money?</span></p><p><span>The goblins stepped back with surprise.&#xA0;</span><span>Dozens of suddenly goblins emerged from the rocks!&#xA0;</span><span>But Grom, who had become crazy, charged towards them without stopping his assault.&#xA0;</span><span>He was like a runaway train!</span></p><p><span>&quot;Buuuuuuuuul&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500; taaaaaaaaar&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;!&#x201D;</span></p><p></p><p style="text-align: center"><span>***</span></p><p></p><p><span>-</span><i><span>Then this corner!</span></i></p><p><span>-</span><i><span>A video is the topic!</span></i> <i><span>Video of a video!</span></i> <i><span>A distilled version is given!</span></i></p><p><span>-</span><i><span>It is like red ginseng extract!</span></i></p><p><span>-</span><i><span>Oh, Jaehan-ssi.</span></i> <i><span>Don&#x2019;t you think red ginseng is too much?</span></i></p><p><span>-</span><i><span>Hahaha.</span></i> <i><span>I&#x2019;m sorry.</span></i> <i><span>I don&#x2019;t know because I have been taking red ginseng medicine lately.</span></i></p><p><span>-</span><i><span>Distilled?</span></i> <i><span>Ohoho, who told you that it was good for you?</span></i></p><p><span>-</span><i><span>It is a secret.</span></i> <i><span>Ahahahaha. </span></i><span>(TL Note: red ginseng can be taken as an aphrodisiac and used to help with male erectile dysfunction)</span></p><p><span>&quot;They are playing around.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Yiyu shook her head.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;The atmosphere around the two of them is what wins viewers.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;What are they going to discuss?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Yiyu was at Caf&#xE9; Reason with her friend, Yoon Bora.&#xA0;</span><span>They were meeting for a group assignment. But as always, various accidents and illnesses occurred, meaning that only the two of them attended.&#xA0;</span><span>The two of them quickly quit the task.</span></p><p><span>They watched as the two hosts of [Elder Road Times], Yoojung and Jaehan, introduced the topic.</span></p><p><span>-</span><i><span>The fourth video is a comedy in Elder Lord and will make your stomach hurt just watching it!</span></i> <i><span>It is a behind the scenes video of the militia leader, Kim Dalkwang.</span></i></p><p><i><span>-Isn&#x2019;t another name for Kim Dalkwang &#x2018;Capitalist Monster&#x2019;, a monster born from capitalism?</span></i></p><p><i><span>-Yes!</span></i> <i><span>He boasts exceptional role-playing skills.</span></i> <i><span>Of course, he isn&#x2019;t just funny but also has great abilities.</span></i> <i><span>Now, then please watch!</span></i></p><p><span>The door of Caf&#xE9; Reason opened.&#xA0;</span><span>It was Ian. He entered and discovered that Yiyu was here.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;You came?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Yes, Oppa.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Oppa, hello!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Ian smiled at Yoon Bora&#x2019;s greeting.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Hello. Bora-ssi right?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Yes, you remembered. It&#x2019;s been a while.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;That&apos;s right. You must be busy. You should come here more often.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Yes!&quot;</span></p><p><span>Yiyu elbowed Yoon Bora.</span></p><p><span>&quot;Why, what is it?&quot;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Look at this.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Ian also eyed the tablet.&#xA0;</span><span>He was now an Elder Lord player. It was necessary to know the hot topics.</span></p><p><span>-</span><i><span>Hahahaha.</span></i> <i><span>That is really funny.</span></i></p><p><span>-</span><i><span>Yes.</span></i> <i><span>Kukuk.</span></i> <i><span>My belly button has fallen off.</span></i> <i><span>Jaehan-ssi, please find my belly button.</span></i> <i><span>It is gone.</span></i></p><p><span>-</span><i><span>Hahaha.</span></i> <i><span>Belly button?</span></i></p><p><span>-</span><i><span>Yes, belly button.</span></i> <i><span>Find it!</span></i></p><p><i><span>I&#x2019;ll find it after the recording.</span></i> <i><span>Please believe in me.</span></i></p><p><span>-</span><i><span>Oh, impressive!</span></i></p><p><span>&#x201C;Hu...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Ian shook his head.</span></p><p><span>-</span><i><span>I&#x2019;m sorry.</span></i> <i><span>Hahaha!</span></i> <i><span>This time, Youvidser Laney filmed a video that is very hot!</span></i></p><p><i><span>-Orc users, wake up!</span></i> <i><span>The force of an orc warrior!</span></i> <i><span>Let&#x2019;s feel it altogether!</span></i></p><p><span>Ian focused on the orc.&#xA0;</span><span>What orc had done a wonderful job of spreading the taste of orcs to the ignorant humans?</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;......&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>However, the scene was familiar.&#xA0;</span><span>An orc quickly slaughtered three users.&#xA0;</span><span>The face that looked into the air as he held his weapon was familiar.&#xA0;</span><span>That was obviously...</span></p><p><i><span>-Today, I met three wicked people and killed them, implementing justice.</span></i></p><p><span>&#x201C;Cough...&#x201D;</span></p><p><i><span>-Where are the people who know honor?</span></i></p><p><span>&quot;C-Cough! Cough!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Oppa, what is it?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;No, that, cough! Cough!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Did you swallow something the wrong way?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>He had choked with dismay.&#xA0;</span><span>Yiyu gave some water to Ian. Ian sipped the water while calming his surprise.&#xA0;</span><span>Ian was confused by the complicated emotions he felt as he listened to Yiyu and Yoon Bora talk about how cool and manly the orc was.</span></p><p><span>&apos;Who filmed that?&#x2019;</span></p><p><span>At that moment, the notification bell rang as the door to Caf&#xE9; Reason opened.</span></p><p><span>A woman entered.</span></p><p><span>She was a considerable beauty. She walked in gracefully with expensive clothes that seemed to shine. Her hair was wavy, as if it was copper wire, and each sweep of her head was a seductive gesture that made the people who saw it tremble.</span></p><p><span>Had a real celebrity appeared for a photo shoot?&#xA0;</span><span>People who looked like bodyguards waited outside the door. No, they were bodyguards.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Pretty&#x2026;&#x201D; Yiyu admired.</span></p><p><span>The woman headed to the counter.</span></p><p><span>&quot;Yes, what would you like to order?&#x201D; The part time worker, Han Yeori, asked.</span></p><p><span>&quot;The boss, is he here?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Eh? The boss?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Yes, Jung Ian-ssi.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;That...Boss, over there...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Han Yeori pointed to Ian.&#xA0;</span><span>The woman turned slowly.&#xA0;</span><span>She smiled as she found Ian.&#xA0;</span><span>That face was familiar.</span></p><p><span>On the other side, Ian recalled the name of the woman who cried out to him.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Ji Hayeon-ssi?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>The beautiful woman, Ji Hayeon, grinned. It was a bright smile, like a flower blooming in the spring.&#xA0;</span><span>She walked over and held out a hand to Ian.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;It&#x2019;s been a while.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;I didn&apos;t know you would come find me like this.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;I thought I should go see my saviour.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Ian and Ji Hayeon shook hands.</span></p><p><span>&quot;Raven, no, is it Jung Ian-ssi?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Ian smiled a the old name that reminded him of the past.&#xA0;</span><span>&#x201C;Just call me Ian-ssi.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Yes, I will. No. I actually know a little bit about Ian-ssi. Ah, don&#x2019;t worry. I found out after that incident.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>That incident. Ian smiled wryly.&#xA0;</span><span>&quot;Yes.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>She said, &#x201C;Jung Ian-ssi is a little older than me.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Ian cocked his head.&#xA0;</span><span>&quot;Indeed.&quot;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;So it makes sense.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span><span>Ji Hayeon smiled brightly again.&#xA0;</span><span>&#x201C;Is it okay if I call you Oppa?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>On Yiyu&#x2019;s side, there was a frozen silence.</span></p><p><span>In this short meeting, Ian smiled again for a third time.</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p><p><a href="www.wuxiaworld.com">Glossary of Common Korean Terms.</a></p><p>Praise the Orc:&#xA0;<a href="docs.google.com">Glossary Link.&#xA0;</a></p><p>Current schedule: &#xA0;Next Patreon goal reached!!
