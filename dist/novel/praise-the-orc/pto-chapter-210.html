<p><span>Chapter 210 - War of the Gods (8)</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p><p><span>&#x201C;Kyulkyulkyulkyulkyulkyul!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>It was different from Wallachwi&#x2019;s laugh.&#xA0;</span><span>The god looked around.&#xA0;</span><span>There was an orc shaman standing there. However, his teeth were broken and his size was small, like a dwarf.</span></p><p><span>But the god instinctively realized.&#xA0;</span><span>This wasn&#x2019;t a normal shaman.&#xA0;</span><span>The traces of power that the shaman in front of him emanated drew the eyes.&#xA0;</span><span>If Wallachwi was the master of the abyss, this orc was in change of unorthodox magic. And that type of power was at its peak.&#xA0;</span><span>It was the most fearful type of enemy.</span></p><p><span>&quot;It has been a long time since the gods have been concerned!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>The god used his power without any worry. The power went straight through and pierced the orcs. It would&#x2019;ve been nice if he had fallen straight away.&#xA0;</span><span>However, nothing happened.&#xA0;</span><span>The orc was standing next to Wallachwi.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;The abyss. You use a dangerous power! Fight! Kyulkyulkyulkyul!&#x201D;&#xA0;</span><span>He couldn&#x2019;t pronounce words properly but this orc was dangerous.&#xA0;</span><span>&quot;So let me borrow your strength!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>He reached out to Wallachwi. Then Wallachwi&#x2019;s magic power started to be absorbed into the unknown orc.&#xA0;</span><span>He had very little magic power compared to his high status. The magic power he had in the past was broken. It was due to the aftermath of a fight, or maybe an overload of magic.</span></p><p><span>But once the orc absorbed the magic power from Wallachwi, he overcame his only weakness.&#xA0;</span><span>Magic power swelled in his body.&#xA0;</span><span>The same tool would have completely different results depending on who used it.&#xA0;</span><span>It might be the same magic power, but once held in the hands of an unknown orc, it became a more formidable force.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;It has been a while! Kyulkyulkyulkyul!&#x201D;&#xA0;</span><span>As the magic power entered his hands, the orc closed his eyes like he was savoring the aroma.&#xA0;</span><span>&#x201C;This is the first time I&#x2019;ve had so much juice since hitting the &#x2018;demon king!&#x2019;&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>The god tried to destroy the orc before the magic was used, but the attack disappeared into the air as if it had hit a wall.</span></p><p><span>One.</span></p><p><span>Two.</span></p><p><span>Three.</span></p><p><span>In addition, countless magic spells maintained a defensive position around him.&#xA0;</span>The magic surrounded him and blocked all attacks.</p><p><span>&#x201C;You!&quot;</span></p><p><span>The god didn&#x2019;t know what the orc would do, but he desperately used his remaining power. The strong blow aimed at the orc.&#xA0;</span><span>However, rather than disappearing in front of the orc, the attack returned to the god.</span></p><p><span>As his own power swept towards him, the god hurriedly evaded in order to avoid hurting himself. It was the first time he had been hit like this by an enemy. A chill went down his spine.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Kyulkyulkyulkyulkyulkyul! What a funny show!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>The god was angry at the ridicule, but he no longer had any power to attack.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;You dare...!&#x201D;&#xA0;</span><span>Due to his anger, light emerged from the god&#x2019;s eyes.&#xA0;</span><span>&quot;I will show you the full power of the gods!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Kyulkyulkyul! Be patient!&#x201D;&#xA0;</span><span>The orc shook his head.&#xA0;</span><span>&quot;The gods don&#x2019;t have anything else to show! I noticed!&quot;</span></p><p><span>&quot;......!&quot;</span></p><p><span>&quot;I knew long ago. If the gods can use all their strength, how can us mortals survive?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Now Wallachwi regained his spirit and rose.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Kuhul...hul!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>His nasty laugh had returned.</span></p><p><span>Besides.</span></p><p><span>&quot;This is enough, so how about we end it here?&#x201D; A voice was suddenly heard.</span></p><p><span>An elf wearing luxurious clothes and an elegant expression appeared.&#xA0;</span><span>Once he appeared, silence fell on the battlefield. The fighting stopped.&#xA0;</span><span>There was a grass-like smell.&#xA0;</span><span>The hearts of those fighting calmed. Anger, hatred, fear and struggle, they all faded away. Their wounds and pain were healed.</span></p><p><span>The gods knew who the elf was.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;You!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>It was the embodiment of the world tree.&#xA0;</span><span>The world tree who looked after the elves.&#xA0;</span><span>He refused to enter this war just before it started. Now he showed himself.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;What do you mean by that?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>He was very high among the gods, so the voice of the god who questioned him was polite.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Stop now.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;The fight has already begun. Someone must lose.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Whether it was them or the orcs, someone had to get results.</span></p><p><span>&quot;But it seems like you are losing strength.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;......&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;There might be a problem when you use more power.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>As the world tree said, the battlefield was currently in a confrontational stage and the other gods were slowly being pushed back.&#xA0;</span><span>The power of the orcs was great. The gods&#x2019; power was limited so their attacks were being prevented. After the army from the north appeared, the gods started to be pushed back.</span></p><p><span>If this was the case, they truly might lose.&#xA0;</span><span>Many gods agreed with the world tree&#x2019;s words and nodded.</span></p><p><span>&quot;Do you want us to step back now? We can&#x2019;t do that.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span><span>But some gods, like Tartatod, never thought about stopping the fight.</span></p><p><span>The world tree said,&#xA0;</span><span>&quot;Then let&apos;s do this.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>He pointed to a distant place.&#xA0;</span><span>It was the middle of the battlefield.&#xA0;</span><span>It was the fight that hadn&#x2019;t stopped since the war began.</span></p><p><span>&quot;They won&#x2019;t be able to stop anyway, so the result of that battle will decide the war.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Crockta and the war god.&#xA0;</span><span>They were continuing their fierce fighting without looking around.&#xA0;</span><span>Every swing tore up the inside of the Colosseum, a part of a series of attacks that could scatter the earth.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;They...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>The proposal of the world tree wasn&#x2019;t just towards one god.&#xA0;</span><span>It was passed onto all the gods on the battlefield.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;......&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>The expedition was also in such a severe state that they didn&#x2019;t want to fight anymore. His proposal was really tempting for them.</span></p><p><span>&quot;The war god won&#x2019;t lose.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Crockta will win.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Both sides said at the same time.&#xA0;</span><span>Tired of fighting, they nodded at the world tree&#x2019;s offer. This flow spread throughout the battlefield.&#xA0;</span><span>The gods discussed it in their own language before agreeing to the world tree&#x2019;s offer.</span></p><p><span>They were also tired of this war. Under the circumstances, they might really receive an irreversible blow from mortals.</span></p><p><span>&quot;I understand.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>The great war, which started with the collision of the expedition army and the orcs, would be ended by Crockta and the war god.&#xA0;</span><span>The war stopped.&#xA0;</span><span>Once the act of dying and killing ceased, the battlefield became still.</span></p><p><i><span>Kung!</span></i> <i><span>Kwaang!</span></i></p><p><i><span>Kuaaaaang!</span></i></p><p><span>Only the sound of the war god and Crockta fighting was heard.&#xA0;</span><span>All eyes turned to them.&#xA0;</span><span>They gathered around the Colosseum.&#xA0;</span><span>In a harsh space where no one could escape until one of them was dead, Crockta and the war god attacked unceasingly. Everyone watched them.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Kyulkyulkyulkyul!&#x201D;&#xA0;</span><span>The shaman, Caburak laughed.</span></p><p><span>&quot;Our great chieftain is strong. A warrior who isn&#x2019;t pushed when facing the war god!&quot;</span></p><p><span>The northern orcs had nothing but praise for Crockta.&#xA0;</span><span>The expedition army cheered for the war god.</span></p><p><span>And the parties involved, Crockta and the war god.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;You are good, War God.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Impertinent fellow.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>They didn&#x2019;t pay any attention to the people around them. Their focus was on the enemy.</span></p><p></p><p style="text-align: center"><span>***</span></p><p></p><p><span>Crockta&apos;s attack didn&#x2019;t reach the war god.&#xA0;</span><span>At best, he struck the shield.</span></p><p><span>After the Colosseum formed, the war god revealed his fighting skills and it was phenomenal.&#xA0;</span><span>Indeed, this was the god of war. There was no waste in his movements and every move had a clear purpose.</span></p><p><i><span>Kwaang!</span></i></p><p><span>He struck Crockta with the shield, then wielded his sword. Crockta was unable to avoid it due to the aftermath of the shield hit, blocking with God Slayer instead.&#xA0;</span><span>Iron hit iron and sparks flew.</span></p><p><span>&quot;A great sword. These flames are good.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>The war god said.</span></p><p><span>Crockta&#x2019;s sword God Slayer was something that Zakiro, blacksmith of the Golden Anvil Clan, had smelted with the last fire. It was a masterpiece that was at least the legend rank.&#xA0;</span><span>The scariest thing about the sword was that it contained the power of the sun god.</span></p><p><span>A strike from this sword could severely damage the godhead. Maybe a god would even die.&#xA0;</span><span>The war god could clearly feel it from within the sword: that he shouldn&#x2019;t take a hit from this sword.&#xA0;</span><span>Therefore, he had to protect himself. He covered his body with the shield and aimed the sword towards Crockta from behind.</span></p><p><span>&quot;How long will you be on the defensive, War God!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Crockta&#x2019;s body surpassed the Pinnacle.&#xA0;</span><span>Now he had reached a transcendent realm.&#xA0;</span><span>It was unclear how it would work against the gods.&#xA0;</span><span>However.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Ugh!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>The sudden and transcendental attack broke one arm of the war god, causing flames to sprout from the blunt injury.&#xA0;</span><span>The war god was furious.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Insolent!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>He certainly blocked the attack, but causality reversed and he was hit by God Slayer.&#xA0;</span><span>The war god&#x2019;s power meant that flames already burned around his body, but God Slayer had a divine attribute and damaged the god of war.&#xA0;</span><span>It was shameful, experiencing such humiliation from a mortal.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Crocktaaaaaaaaaa!&#x201D; shouted the war god, throwing his shield. Crockta stabbed with the greatsword, but the strength was tremendous and his balance was twisted.&#xA0;</span><span>The war god approached and stabbed his sword in the gap.&#xA0;</span><span>Blood splattered from Crockta&#x2019;s body.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Ugh!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Crockta stepped back. The war god kept approaching.</span></p><p><span>&quot;I made a mistake.&quot;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;......&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;I was arrogant, trying to win against you without receiving any damage. Now I recognize you as my real opponent.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>He picked up the shield that fell to the ground.&#xA0;</span><span>However, he didn&#x2019;t hide behind the shield as before. Rather, the shield also attacked Crockta.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;This is the real Colosseum.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>The war god gestured around him.&#xA0;</span><span>Crockta&#x2019;s gaze followed his actions.&#xA0;</span><span>The war had stopped.&#xA0;</span><span>The orcs, expedition members and northern orcs, they were all standing on the battlefield and watching the fight between the war god and Crockta.</span></p><p><span>&quot;Kulkulkul...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Crockta laughed.&#xA0;</span><span>He didn&#x2019;t know the details, but the northern orcs had come to help him.&#xA0;</span><span>There were familiar faces.&#xA0;</span><span>There was Caburak who was laughing, Surka who placed a hand on his chest, Driden with his calm eyes and the old warrior Hammerchwi.</span></p><p><span>&quot;The fight is now ours.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Now the war god and Crockta were the only ones holding a weapon.</span></p><p><span>The war god said with a blazing face,&#xA0;</span><span>&#x201C;The gods have expressed their opinions. The result of the war will be determined with our fight. We will withdraw if you win.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Kulkulkul, the packaging is done well. In the end, you were just scared of us.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Impertinent fellow.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span><span>The fires of the war god became even stronger.&#xA0;</span><span>&quot;If we really used all of our power, this place and Orcrox would disappear forever from the map.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>But Crockta wasn&#x2019;t concerned about his anger.&#xA0;</span><span>He just closed his eyes.&#xA0;</span><span>A cold wind chilled the sweat on his body.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;A fight that has to be won...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Once again, everything was on his shoulders.&#xA0;</span><span>Tens of thousands of lives depended on him. His defeat meant everyone&#x2019;s defeat, and his victory meant everyone&#x2019;s victory.&#xA0;</span><span>The audience of those dangerous duel was the entire world.</span></p><p><span>He could feel the gazes staring at him.&#xA0;</span><span>There were countless eyes. The orcs, gods, and people watching through the screen.&#xA0;</span><span>All the gazes were pushing at Crockta&#x2019;s back.</span></p><p><span>Crockta grinned,&#xA0;</span><span>&quot;Not bad.&quot;</span></p><p><span>His opponent was the war god.&#xA0;</span><span>The master of war, born for war, tempered by war and someone who looked forward to war. He was literally the god of war.&#xA0;</span><span>The most honorable foe.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Hey.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Crockta placed the greatsword on his shoulder and called out.&#xA0;</span><span>But there was no answer. Crockta continued speaking.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Are you alive right now?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;...Impertinent fellow.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span><span>The war god chuckled in a low voice. He also knew the saying of the orcs.&#xA0;</span><span>&#x201C;Yes, indeed.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;I&apos;m glad.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span><span>Crockta grinned.</span></p><p><span>There was no need to say anything else.&#xA0;</span><span>The two people turned slowly, gazing at each other.&#xA0;</span><span>The war rushed towards the end.</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p><p><a href="www.wuxiaworld.com">Glossary of Common Korean Terms.</a></p><p>Praise the Orc:&#xA0;<a href="docs.google.com">Glossary Link.&#xA0;</a></p><p>Current schedule:&#xA0;There will now be 14 chapters a week, meaning two chapters every day.</p><p>I have also updated my&#xA0;<a href="www.patreon.com">Patreon</a>&#xA0;to reflect my new novels.
