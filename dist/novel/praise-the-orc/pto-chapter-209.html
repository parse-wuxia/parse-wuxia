<p><span>Chapter 209 - War of the Gods (7) &#xA0;</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p><p><span>&#x201C;Is it up to here </span><i><span>dot</span></i><span>...?&#x201D;&#xA0;</span><span>Tiyo laughed bitterly while aiming General&#xA0;</span><span>&#x201C;Anor, are you okay </span><i><span>dot</span></i><span>?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;No...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Anor was staggering after consuming his strength. The undead he summoned were destroyed by the persistent resistance of the expedition forces and the power of the gods.&#xA0;</span><span>The remaining enemies headed towards Tiyo and Anor, the necromancer who summoned the dead and the gnome who slaughtered the soldiers with a magnificent weapon.</span></p><p><span>They were approaching.&#xA0;</span><span>General made a dull clang as it turned round and round. However, Tiyo didn&#x2019;t have the strength to control it anymore.</span></p><p><span>&quot;Crockta...&#x201D;&#xA0;</span><span>Anor saw Crockta fighting with the war god far away. Every time the swords collided, fire flashed.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&quot;He is fighting well </span><i><span>dot</span></i><span>...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>It might be because the god was in a human body or because he was overwhelmed by Crockta&#x2019;s power. Crockta was slowly pushing the enemy back.&#xA0;</span><span>Ordinary human eyes wouldn&#x2019;t be able to see their movements.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Kahahahahat!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Tiyo fired General. Now it was in an ambiguous shape that wasn&#x2019;t a rifle or pistol.&#xA0;</span><span>It felt like Tiyo&#x2019;s current condition.&#xA0;</span><span>However, he raised his gun once again.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Come on </span><i><span>dot</span></i><span>! Tiyo won&#x2019;t run or hide!&#x201D;&#xA0;</span><span>The expedition members withdrew at the shout of the small gnome. There were some lower gods, but Tiyo&#x2019;s momentum overwhelmed them all.&#xA0;</span><span>&quot;Anor</span><i><span> dot</span></i><span>! Are you ready?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;R-Ready for what?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Of course</span><i><span> dot</span></i><span>! Ready to die!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;I don&#x2019;t...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;How wonderful </span><i><span>dot</span></i><span>! Fight until the end!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>The expedition members rushed.</span></p><p><span>Tiyo rolled to the side, evading the attacks and firing General. The obviously weakened magic bullets struck them, and while they couldn&#x2019;t kill them, they were capable enough to make the enemies fall to the ground.</span></p><p><span>Tiyo pulled something out, a dagger, and aimed it at the necks of the fallen enemies. Blood splattered every which way.</span></p><p><span>&quot;You are lucky to see the knife fighting of Quantes&#x2019; Gnomes Division </span><i><span>dot</span></i><span>.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Tiyo wiped the blood off his face and grinned.&#xA0;</span><span>The expedition members rushed angrily.&#xA0;</span><span>Then those who were just killed by Tiyo jumped up and started attacking. Anor exerted his power.&#xA0;</span><span>However, the power of the gods disturbed the necromancer&#x2019;s energy. The corpses fell back to their rest.</span></p><p><span>&quot;Kuuack! Tiyo. Attack!&quot;</span></p><p><span>Anor shouted. Tiyo&#x2019;s General struck them before the enemies could rearrange themselves.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;There are many enemies. The other orcs...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Now Tiyo and Anor were the only ones in the area. The other orcs had died.&#xA0;</span><span>Both sides suffered irreparable damage from the fierce fighting, but the expedition had more numbers and survived until the end.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;This...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>More members encircled Tiyo Light filled the eyes of a believer as a god entered. The god wanted to finish off Tiyo and Anor.</span></p><p><span>&quot;Gnome and half-dark elf...you made a foolish choice. Standing on the side of the orcs.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span><span>One god said.&#xA0;</span><span>&quot;In particular, the necromancer is a dirty bloodline.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;......!&quot;</span></p><p><span>Anor&#x2019;s face turned sour.</span></p><p><span>&quot;You aren&#x2019;t associated with the grey god but... I see you well. You guys are worthy of death.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;What the hell are you saying, you bast...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>The moment that Anor was going to furiously curse...&#xA0;</span><span>A spear of light flew from the god&#x2019;s hand. It headed for Anor&#x2019;s heart.</span></p><p><span>&quot;......!&quot;</span></p><p><span>Anor stared blankly at it.&#xA0;</span><span>A light flashed.&#xA0;</span><span>There was a moaning sound.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Hoh...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Tiyo!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Tiyo pushed Anor away and was hit by the spear instead.&#xA0;</span><span>It wasn&#x2019;t a mortal wound but blood was flowing from his abdomen. Tiyo fell to the ground and coughed up blood.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Kuhuhuhut... Cough, cough! Kuhut, kahahat! Cough!&#x201D;&#xA0;</span><span>Tiyo jeered while coughing up blood at the same time.&#xA0;</span><span>&#x201C;Only this much </span><i><span>dot</span></i><span>...?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Tiyo stood up on trembling legs. Anor tried to stop him, but Tiyo pushed his hand away.&#xA0;</span><span>As Tiyo stood up, an expression of admiration appeared on the god&#x2019;s face.</span></p><p><span>&quot;Who are you? I&#x2019;ve never seen a gnome like you.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Me </span><i><span>dot</span></i><span>?&#x201D;&#xA0;</span><span>Tiyo raised his chin. He was bloody but his expression was still confident.&#xA0;</span><span>&quot;I am the son of the great adventurer Hedor, the former captain of Quantes&#x2019; Gnomes Garrison and a friend of Crockta and Anor, Tiyo</span><i><span> dot</span></i><span>!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Tiyo...&#x201D;&#xA0;</span><span>The god nodded at his dignified declaration.&#xA0;</span><span>&quot;I&apos;ll remember it.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Then he created a light spear again. It flew in a clean line towards Tiyo&#x2019;s heart.&#xA0;</span><span>It was an unwavering trajectory.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Tiyo!&#x201D;&#xA0;</span><span>Anor screamed.</span></p><p><span>Tiyo closed his eyes.&#xA0;</span><span>All things born were meant to die in the end. The important thing wasn&#x2019;t when he died. It was where and how he died.&#xA0;</span><span>He had no regrets in that regard.&#xA0;</span><span>He didn&#x2019;t want to die in a place that wasn&#x2019;t worthy.&#xA0;</span><span>Therefore, he was able to laugh at the last moment.</span></p><p><span>&quot;Adios.&quot;</span></p><p><span>The light spear headed straight for Tiyo&#x2019;s heart.&#xA0;</span><span>It flew straight at him.&#xA0;</span><span>It would split his body apart in one blow.</span></p><p><i><span>Kwajik.</span></i></p><p><span>The spear was crushed.&#xA0;</span><span>An arrow had pierced through it and entered the abdomen of a soldier surrounding Tiyo.</span></p><p><span>&quot;......!&quot;</span></p><p><span>The soldier coughed up blood.&#xA0;</span><span>But that wasn&apos;t the end.&#xA0;</span><span>The arrow started to rotate fiercely in his abdomen.&#xA0;</span><span>It became a storm that sucked in the soldiers around it. The bodies of the soldiers were shredded and flew through the air.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Kuaaaaah!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;What?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;This...!&quot;</span></p><p><span>Everyone looked at the flying flesh with shock.&#xA0;</span><span>It was an incredible sight.</span></p><p><span>There.&#xA0;</span><span>A goblin was holding a bow.</span></p><p><span>&quot;Goblin...?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>However, the goblin didn&#x2019;t care about them. His eyes were only focused on Tiyo, who was ready to die.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Hey </span><i><span>kyak</span></i><span>!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Tiyo&#x2019;s eyes widened.</span></p><p><span>&quot;Y-You...!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Hedor&#x2019;s son</span><i><span> kyak</span></i><span>! Captain of Quantes&#x2019; Gnome Garrison</span><i><span> kyak</span></i><span>! Crockta&#x2019;s follower! Why did you omit one </span><i><span>kyak</span></i><span>?&#x201D;&#xA0;</span><span>The goblin pointed to his chest and laughed.&#xA0;</span><span>&quot;Tiyo, the goblin Kiao&#x2019;s disciple</span><i><span> kyak</span></i><span>!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>The goblin who pursued the path of the strong, the shooter who wiped out the enemy by causing a spatiotemporal storm, Kiao.</span></p><p><span>&quot;How did you come here </span><i><span>dot</span></i><span>?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Don&#x2019;t complain </span><i><span>kyak</span></i><span>! You were yelling at me to save you </span><i><span>kyak</span></i><span>!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;I never said that </span><i><span>dot</span></i><span>!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;How funny that you&#x2019;re trying to deny it</span><i><span> kyak</span></i><span>!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;B-Bullshit </span><i><span>dot</span></i><span>!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Adios </span><i><span>kyak</span></i><span>? Adios</span><i><span> kyak</span></i><span>! I will play alone </span><i><span>kyak</span></i><span>!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;This bastard!&#x201D;&#xA0;</span><span>The face of the god with the light spear distorted as he watched Tiyo and Kiao fight.&#xA0;</span><span>&quot;Where did this monster come fro...!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>The answer came from elsewhere.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Say it again.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>The god flinched. A huge shadow covered his body.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Monster, cancel, what you said.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>The god turned his head.&#xA0;</span><span>A giant cyclops was looking down at him.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;We aren&#x2019;t! Monsters! Cancel it!&#x201D;&#xA0;</span><span>The cyclops shouted and swung his fist. The god barely escaped but had to roll across the ground in an ugly manner.&#xA0;</span><span>&#x201C;I am Hawkeye! He is Kiao! We aren&#x2019;t monsters!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>It was the giant Hawkeye, who fought with Crockta.</span></p><p><span>The expedition panicked at the sudden appearance of the monsters. It wasn&#x2019;t just Kiao and Hawkeye. There was a varity of species, a centaur, a lich, an unknown robed person, and a terrifying ogre.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;How are you...?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Came with the orcs! We! Go together!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>The cyclops pointed to another direction.</span></p><p><span>There.</span></p><p><span>The northern orcs were charging forward. The enemies were easily broken when the orcs attacked the expedition.&#xA0;</span><span>The divine message spread in the north as well. Gushantimur&#x2019;s friends heard about it and came down with the Great Clan orcs to help Crockta.</span></p><p><span>The balance was reversing again.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;You guys...&#x201D;&#xA0;</span><span>The faces of the gods watching distorted.&#xA0;</span><span>&#x201C;Taste the true wrath of the gods!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Their bodies shone white. Then their power started to wriggle. The expedition members were screaming from the pressure but they didn&#x2019;t care.&#xA0;</span><span>Tiyo, Anor, and the creatures retreated with an alert expression. They could feel that the gods were really angry.</span></p><p><span>A storm of power headed to them.</span></p><p></p><p style="text-align: center"><span>***</span></p><p></p><p><span>Kumarak laughed at the appearance of the orcs he had never seen before.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;I don&#x2019;t know what is going on, but I will crush you!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>He looked up at the dwarf holding the hammer.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;We won&#x2019;t lose!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>The dwarf, the father of all underground creatures, Tartatod looked down at him with cold eyes.</span></p><p><span>&quot;It doesn&#x2019;t matter. It is obvious that you will die right now.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Kulkulkul! Kill grrung! Warriors aren&#x2019;t afraid of death!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;I will get revenge for Almutad today.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>The dwarf raised his hammer.&#xA0;</span><span>Then he brought it down with no hesitation.&#xA0;</span><span>It was an intense blow that would split anyone&#x2019;s head apart. It contained enough power to every cause an earthquake.</span></p><p><span>But just before the hammer hit Kumarak.&#xA0;</span><span>The dwarf felt something targeting his neck and heart at the same time, and reflexively twisted his body.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;What?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Sharp blades passed by him. Blood dripped down.&#xA0;</span><span>Tartatod backed away, but the double swords continued to chase him.&#xA0;</span><span>The source was a dark elf with black skin and grey hair.</span></p><p><span>&quot;There will be many interesting people on the continent. Those words are true.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span><span>He waved his double swords and stared at Tartatod. Killing intent was emitted from his body.&#xA0;</span><span>&quot;Gods, are there any better opponents?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Who are you?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>He smiled faintly. Then he briefly replied,&#xA0;</span><span>&#x201C;Driden.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Soon after, he disappeared. Tartatod felt something aim at him from behind and leaned forward. Then a blade stabbed his side. It was a whirlwind linked attack that was hard to stop.&#xA0;</span><span>The genius Driden, who competed with Crockta, had come down to the continent with the Great Clan.</span></p><p><span>Tartatod shouted.&#xA0;</span><span>Now Tartatod&#x2019;s opponent was Driden The two of them wielded their weapons towards each other.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;They are the north...&#x201D;&#xA0;</span><span>The goddess of mercy frowned.</span></p><p><span>She was overpowering Anya in a place not far away.&#xA0;</span><span>She was covered with multiple stab wounds from Anya&#x2019;s axe. The goddess treated herself with her own power, but she was stained with blood.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;I have to help. The battlefield is becoming strange.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>The northern orcs were destroying the expedition. The goddess of mercy&#x2019;s expression soured.&#xA0;</span><span>Her mind was troubled.</span></p><p><span>Anya laughed,&#xA0;</span><span>&#x201C;Where do you want to go? It is an honor to die by the goddess of mercy.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;......&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>The goddess of mercy&#x2019;s lips firmed. Then she started to put strong pressure on Anya&#x2019;s neck.&#xA0;</span><span>Anya&#x2019;s complexion changed. Her face turned white as she ran out of air.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Kuooock...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>In the midst of it, Anya scoffed.&#xA0;</span><span>She wouldn&#x2019;t yield to the enemy under any circumstances.&#xA0;</span><span>There was a warrior who admired that.</span></p><p><span>&quot;There are female orcs with spirit on the continent!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>The goddess of mercy looked around.&#xA0;</span><span>An old orc with a giant hammer stood there.</span></p><p></p><p style="text-align: center"><span>***</span></p><p></p><p><span>Wallachwi collapsed on the ground and sighed. He used all the magic he had, but it wasn&#x2019;t enough to overcome the power of the gods.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Foolish guy.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span><span>The old man declared. His body was half eaten by darkness due to Wallachwi&#x2019;s magic.&#xA0;</span><span>&quot;Did you really think you would win?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Kuhul...hul!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;That laugh makes me feel bad to the end.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span><span>His face twitched.&#xA0;</span><span>&quot;Laugh a lot. If you want to laugh underground, you can never laugh at all.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Wallachwi laughed again, but the god&#x2019;s hands grasped his neck. Wallachwi could no longer make any noise.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Die.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Light emerged from the god&#x2019;s body. Vitality began to disappear from Wallachwi&#x2019;s body.&#xA0;</span><span>His eyes became faint.&#xA0;</span><span>Wallachwi wanted to give one last laugh.</span></p><p><span>He had to laugh. He was the abyss seeker, the shaman who wanted to touch the bottom of the endless darkness.&#xA0;</span><span>He looked deep into the abyss and the abyss looked back at him. He always laughed so that he wouldn&#x2019;t be swallowed by the unknown darkness, and so he wouldn&#x2019;t choke on the fear.</span></p><p><span>Kuhul...hul!</span></p><p><span>But there was no sound.&#xA0;</span><span>Too bad.&#xA0;</span><span>In the distant, invisible darkness, the abyss was licking at him.&#xA0;</span><span>The moment his mind was about to become faint.</span></p><p><span>Suddenly, a loud laugh rang in his ears and woke him up.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Kyulkyulkyulkyulkyulkyul!&#x201D;</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p><p><a href="www.wuxiaworld.com">Glossary of Common Korean Terms.</a></p><p>Praise the Orc:&#xA0;<a href="docs.google.com">Glossary Link.&#xA0;</a></p><p>Current schedule:&#xA0;There will now be 14 chapters a week, meaning two chapters every day.</p><p>I have also updated my&#xA0;<a href="www.patreon.com">Patreon</a>&#xA0;to reflect my new novels.
