<p><span>Chapter 198 - Like a Slave, Like a King (2)</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p><p><span>&quot;What are you thinking about?&#x201D; asked Crockta.</span></p><p><span>The furrowed lines on the elf&#x2019;s face didn&#x2019;t disappear as he continued simultaneously thinking, walking, and eating.&#xA0;</span><span>Yet he kept looking at Crockta, Zankus, and Arakunta, as if he were observing them.</span></p><p><span>Crockta felt a monkey being studied by a zoologist.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&quot;I don&#x2019;t know what it is, but I might be able to help.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>The elf stared at Crockta with an intense gaze.&#xA0;</span><span>However, his answer was a refusal.&#xA0;</span><span>&#x201C;No, it is a problem that I have to answer.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Then please stop. Do you have to look at us to find the answer?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>The elf nodded in agreement, &#x201C;That&#x2019;s right.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Then what&#x2019;s the problem? I feel worried when you look at us.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;I can&#x2019;t tell you.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Ohh, how frustrating!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Arakunta laughed as he watched both of them.&#xA0;</span><span>&quot;He&#x2019;s a person with many secrets. Still, he isn&#x2019;t a bad person so calm down.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Crockta nodded as he chewed on meat.&#xA0;</span><span>&#x201C;I understand. By the way....&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>They were eating the venison that Zankus hunted and Tiyo cooked.&#xA0;</span><span>Their speed was a little slower after Arakunta and the elf joined, but they were steadily heading towards Orcrox.&#xA0;</span><span>They would arrive soon.</span></p><p><span>&quot;Setting aside the elf friend for now, what&#x2019;s that noise?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Isn&#x2019;t it someone passing by </span><i><span>dot</span></i><span>?</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;They seem to be hiding.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Zankus chewed on the venison and said, &#x201C;Sounds like bandits.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>They were talking about a rustling bush.&#xA0;</span><span>While Crockta&#x2019;s group was eating, the bushes moved and a group of humans approached.&#xA0;</span><span>They seemed to be sneaking around, but it was impossible to fool Crockta&#x2019;s group.&#xA0;</span><span>They all knew about the approach of the humans and kept quiet.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Y-You noticed quickly!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;But that doesn&apos;t change anything, Orcs!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>The humans popped out from the bushes, all wearing the same equipment: leather armor, a sword, and a shield.&#xA0;</span><span>Their posture was poor, but their willpower was good.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;In the name of the gods!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Punish the orcs!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>They rushed forward.&#xA0;</span><span>Crockta&#x2019;s group exchanged glances, as if passing on the burden, before eventually settling on Crockta.&#xA0;</span><span>Crockta couldn&#x2019;t hold up against their heavy gazes and stood up with God Slayer in hand.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Annoying.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Crockta stepped forward and wielded the sword. The wind blew. The enemies were pushed away by the wind pressure and fell.</span></p><p><span>&quot;Hup!&quot;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;What?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Their momentum was quickly dampened by his overwhelming dance.&#xA0;</span><span>They couldn&#x2019;t come any closer and stared at Crockta. The fallen people raised their bodies. Their weapons trembled.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;What strength...!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>They grabbed their necklaces and prayed to their god.&#xA0;</span><span>The group wasn&#x2019;t made up of bandits, but fanatics targeting the orcs. Apart from the expedition, there were also small groups raiding orcs.&#xA0;</span><span>However, they found the wrong opponents.</span></p><p><span>&quot;Follow the divine message! For the god of war!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;We shall shed blood for the goddess of mercy!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;For the divine message!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>They rushed towards Crockta&#x2019;s group again. However, Crockta broke all their weapons using God Slayer. As soon as the greatsword hit it, the shields flew away from the shock.&#xA0;</span><span>They weren&#x2019;t his opponents.</span></p><p><span>&quot;Do you still want to continue?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Crockta headed towards the fallen humans. The humans wriggled as the shadow approached.&#xA0;</span><span>Crockta smiled and placed his foot on the chest of one person, who let out a moan.</span></p><p><span>&quot;Yes, the gods want to kill us?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Kuock...that&#x2019;s right. The goddess of mercy, no one else, said that! How wicked must you be for the goddess of mercy and compassion to want to kill you! For the goddess!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>They wielded their weapons again but were forced to drop them due to Crockta.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Keeeok...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;The gods...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Crockta shrugged and asked,&#xA0;</span><span>&quot;Have you ever wondered about the gods you are following?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;What nonsense is this...?&quot;</span></p><p><span>&quot;I will let you know. They aren&#x2019;t perfect. They lie as we do and deceive others for their own benefit.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Crockta knew about the divine message.&#xA0;</span><span>So he knew that the gods weren&#x2019;t absolutely omnipotent. The gods believed that Crockta and the orcs were colluding with the grey god.&#xA0;</span><span>This was false.&#xA0;</span><span>Crockta had met the grey god. But they were closer to enemies than allies.</span></p><p><span>The situation was ridiculous in Crockta&#x2019;s eyes, so he thought that the people who believed in the divine message were pitiful.</span></p><p><span>&quot;We aren&#x2019;t conspiring with the grey god.&quot;</span></p><p><span>&quot;What nonsense are you saying?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;We have no intention of causing a war.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Shut up! We will get rid of you!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;I see.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>The humans had no intention of listening to Crockta&#x2019;s words.&#xA0;</span><span>Was it because Crockta was pointing a sword at them? Or was their beliefs really that high?&#xA0;</span><span>Crockta lifted God Slayer to confirm it.&#xA0;</span><span>He moved the blade.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;W-Wait a minute...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>The greatsword slowly fell down.&#xA0;</span><span>The struggling man caught the blade with his hand. He couldn&#x2019;t wrap his hand around God Slayer&#x2019;s huge blade.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Kuooooh...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>He also couldn&#x2019;t beat Crockta&#x2019;s strength.&#xA0;</span><span>He closed his eyes as the blade of the sword pointed at his neck.</span></p><p><span>&quot;W-Wait a minute...!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;I&apos;m going to kill you.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span><span>Crockta grinned.</span></p><p><span>The man shouted as it was about to touch him,&#xA0;</span><span>&#x201C;S-Spare me!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>The blade stopped.</span></p><p><span>&quot;Spare you?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Y-Yes. Stop for a second...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Didn&#x2019;t you say you wanted to kill me and the orcs?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;I lost. I admit it.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span><span>The man shouted with closed eyes. Moisture emerged from the tightly closed eyes.&#xA0;</span><span>&quot;I surrender! Spare me!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>His hands shook while holding onto the blade and he shouted.</span></p><p><span>&quot;Do the rest of you have the same thoughts?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Crockta looked around at the believers. Their breathing was rough as they watched Crockta and the man.&#xA0;</span><span>Then they nodded.&#xA0;</span><span>Crockta pulled God Slayer away.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Understood.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>The man got up quickly and stood with his party. They all looked at Crockta.</span></p><p><span>Crockta declared,&#xA0;</span><span>&#x201C;Throw away your weapons.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>They exchanged looks before slowly dropping their weapons. The spears, swords, shields, etc were all dropped.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;And...&#x201D;&#xA0;</span><span>Crockta placed God Slayer on his shoulder.&#xA0;</span><span>&#x201C;Get out of here. The scared humans started to run away.</span></p><p><span>Crockta admired their quick movements before returning to the party. His face was calm because it was a natural victory.</span></p><p><span>&quot;Daring to go against Crockta... humans are so stupid!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Arakunta was delighted after seeing their movements.&#xA0;</span><span>Crockta laughed as he sat back down and picked up the venison. It hadn&#x2019;t cooled down yet.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Hey.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span><span>At that time, the elf opened his mouth.&#xA0;</span><span>&quot;Why did you just let them go?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Crockta chewed on the venison and replied.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Why?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;They will come back again after running away. They will join the expedition or attack the other orcs.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Crockta nodded.&#xA0;</span><span>&quot;I guess so.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Then why did you leave them alive?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;That...&#x201D;&#xA0;</span><span>Crockta laughed. He swallowed the venison and said.&#xA0;</span><span>&quot;It is a good day.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;What are you talking about?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;The sunshine is good and the wind is cool, so I let them go. They are just following the gods&#x2019; divine message, and haven&#x2019;t sinned.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;......&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;In addition, a warrior doesn&#x2019;t attack unarmed people!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>The lines on the elf&#x2019;s face thickened further.&#xA0;</span><span>&quot;Are you serious?&quot;</span></p><p><span>&quot;I&#x2019;m serious.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span><span>Crockta got up after the meal.&#xA0;</span><span>&quot;There is one thing I want to say.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;What is it?&quot;</span></p><p><span>&quot;I don&apos;t know what you are so worried about. Anyway, all of us will die someday. Life is short so we should just focus on the present.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span><span>Crockta grinned.&#xA0;</span><span>&quot;You are alive right now.&quot;</span></p><p><span>The elf&#x2019;s eyes widened at Crockta&#x2019;s words. At the same time, the wrinkles on his brow disappeared.&#xA0;</span><span>His face was like a pure and bright elf youth.&#xA0;</span><span>He looked at Crockta quietly before the lines reappeared.&#xA0;</span><span>But there was a slight smile on his face.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;I see. Yes, that is your greeting.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span><span>He muttered.</span></p><p><span>Crockta&#x2019;s group started moving again. Now Crockta knew the terrain.&#xA0;</span><span>Orcrox was around the corner.</span></p><p></p><p style="text-align: center"><span>***</span></p><p></p><p><span>Anail&#x2019;s king of the underworld.&#xA0;</span><span>No one could go against him.&#xA0;</span><span>It didn&#x2019;t mean he terrorized the citizens. However, he penetrated into people&#x2019;s psychology and deliberately seduced them into a contract.&#xA0;</span><span>If they cheated and broke the contract, a pain worse than death waited.</span></p><p><span>That was his way.&#xA0;</span><span>As such, he also kept his promises.</span></p><p><span>&quot;Thompson.&quot;&#xA0;</span><span>Then he slowly called the opponent&#x2019;s name.&#xA0;</span><span>The opponent&#x2019;s face was distorted with pain.&#xA0;</span><span>&#x201C;Your answer?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;......&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;It will just get worse...&#x201D;&#xA0;</span><span>Anail&#x2019;s king teased.&#xA0;</span><span>A pained moan emerged from Thompson&#x2019;s mouth.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Ugh..!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>The man grinned,&#xA0;</span><span>&quot;It would be easier if you listened to me.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Thompson gritted his teeth and replied,&#xA0;</span><span>&#x201C;Don&#x2019;t make me...laugh.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;You don&#x2019;t seem to know your situation.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>The man&#x2019;s laughter rang out in the sealed room.&#xA0;</span><span>Thompson&#x2019;s body shook as he closed his eyes. He didn&#x2019;t expect this man to be like this. He had been silent, only to suddenly push the blade towards Thompson.&#xA0;</span><span>Thompson tried to resist as much as possible, but it couldn&#x2019;t be helped.</span></p><p><span>He visualized many scenes in his head as the man&#x2019;s hand moved again.</span></p><p><span>Then he cried out, &#x201C;Stop.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Now give up.&quot;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Stop. I understand.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>The man laughed,&#xA0;</span><span>&quot;People are fun. You know the result yet still want to challenge it. Continue and continue. In the vain belief that one day you will win.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;......&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;It is human weakness. Thompson.&quot;</span></p><p><span>Thompson couldn&#x2019;t resist anymore and shouted,&#xA0;</span><span>&quot;Ah, don&#x2019;t imitate that bastard&#x2019;s tone!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>The man was surprised at the sudden shout,&#xA0;</span><span>&#x201C;W-Why are you shouting all of a sudden, Brother?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span>&#x201C;That&#x2019;s it. You cheated! That&#x2019;s right!&#x201D;&#xA0;</span><span>Thompson pointed at the chessboard located between them.&#xA0;</span><span>&quot;You were a novice before the bet, yet your skills suddenly improved? Isn&#x2019;t this cheating in chess?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Oh, I didn&#x2019;t study. Brother, there is no need to be angry. I don&#x2019;t study but my mind is good. I got better after a few matches. Brother&#x2019;s mind is too stiff!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Eek...!&#x201D;&#xA0;</span><span>Thompson took deep breaths from where he was sitting.&#xA0;</span><span>&#x201C;Pant, pant. Ah, shit.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>The man laughed at Thompson&#x2019;s voice and said,&#xA0;</span><span>&quot;The game is over. Then, I will enforce the contract...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Don&#x2019;t follow Derek!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;What&apos;s wrong with that?&#x201D;&#xA0;</span><span>The man whistled.&#xA0;</span><span>&quot;He has already died.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Jeremy grinned.&#xA0;</span><span>&quot;Isn&#x2019;t that right, Kids?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>The big men in black outfits, watching the chess match, bowed their heads and shouted.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;That&#x2019;s right! Brother!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;That&#x2019;s correct!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Dead!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Brother killed him!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Jeremy shrugged.&#xA0;</span><span>&quot;Right.&quot;</span></p><p><span>Thompson shook his head at the scene.&#xA0;</span><span>&quot;Derek didn&#x2019;t do this but...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;This fits my taste. By the way...&#x201D;&#xA0;</span><span>Jeremy coughed.&#xA0;</span><span>&quot;Doesn&#x2019;t the expedition want you to sell supplies to them?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Ah, there was something like that.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Are you going to sell it?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;What?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Sell goods...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;You bastard, are you disregarding me? Eh!&#x201D;&#xA0;</span><span>Thompson jumped up and overturned the chessboard.&#xA0;</span><span>&#x201C;I am Thompson. I&#x2019;m not a man who will break faith. Crockta and Hoyt are my friends! I absolutely won&#x2019;t sell to them!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Ah, no! Uh!&#x201D;&#xA0;</span><span>Jeremy&#x2019;s face distorted.&#xA0;</span><span>&quot;Why is the chessboard overturned!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Eh? My mistake. Why did you say something like that? It is your fault.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;This is completely cheating!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Aren&#x2019;t you trying to swindle a merchant living on one credit?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>The two big shots of Anail.&#xA0;</span><span>Thompson of the Thompson Company and Jeremy, king of Anail&#x2019;s underworld, hollered at each other.</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p><p><a href="www.wuxiaworld.com">Glossary of Common Korean Terms.</a></p><p>Praise the Orc:&#xA0;<a href="docs.google.com">Glossary Link.&#xA0;</a></p><p>Current schedule:&#xA0;There will now be 14 chapters a week, meaning two chapters every day.</p><p>I have also updated my&#xA0;<a href="www.patreon.com">Patreon</a>&#xA0;to reflect my new novels.
