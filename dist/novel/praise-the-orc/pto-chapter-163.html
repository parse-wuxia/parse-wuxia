<p><span>Chapter 163 - Empire Strikes Back (2)</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p><p><span>&#x2018;Undergames&#x2019;, a broadcasting channel specialized for games, acquired a tip first.&#xA0;</span><span>It was news that Elder Lord&#x2019;s best-selling &#x2018;War Maestro&#x2019; Rommel and the Heaven and Earth Clan were beginning their large-scale quest.</span></p><p><span>The quest wasn&#x2019;t an ordinary raid.&#xA0;</span><span>War-content that couldn&#x2019;t be seen on a peaceful continent. This time, it wasn&#x2019;t a small, contained skirmish, but rather a vast, extensive war that made use of a great army. </span></p><p><span>Recently, the Heaven and Earth Clan had formed a closer relationship with the kingdom and it was reported that they were leading the empire&#x2019;s army.&#xA0;</span><span>It was a real war.</span></p><p><span>Channel Undergames, which had grown quickly through Elder Lord, didn&#x2019;t want to miss this event.&#xA0;</span><span>So they decided to postpone the PvP contest and organized a special program that relayed the quest progress in real time.</span></p><p><span>They negotiated with the Heaven and Earth Clan and paid a large amount of royalties. Then they launched a new online channel filled with commentators aside from BJ Heaven and Earth.</span></p><p><span>The name:</span></p><p><span>&lt;I am my own Lord through Heaven and Earth - Empire Strikes Back Chapter 0&gt;</span><span>(TL: Seems to have taken the name from a Buddhist saying that includes Heaven and Earth)</span></p><p><span>They just used words that looked great, but this childish name attracted people&#x2019;s attention.&#xA0;</span><span>Then the broadcast started.&#xA0;</span><span>It was a hardcore program that tracked the Heaven and Earth Clan 24 hours a day in real time.</span></p><p><span>The storytelling was already overflowing.&#xA0;</span><span>They were the knights of the emperor who fought for the empire&#x2019;s revival, and those who opposed it were rebels.&#xA0;</span><span>Towards the unrighteous, the empire knights and the Heaven and Earth Clan would raise their swords.</span></p><p><span>The Heaven and Earth Clan became the hottest topic.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Aren&#x2019;t they just slaughtering weak people?&#x201D;&#xA0;</span><span>There were some people who said it, but their opinions were ignored.</span></p><p><span>Those were just human rights people.&#xA0;</span><span>The ones being killed were NPCs.</span></p><p><span>It was enough to create a Heaven and Earth mania.</span></p><p></p><p style="text-align: center"><span>***</span></p><p></p><p><span>&quot;The goal is the occupation of Espada.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Rommel explained.</span></p><p><span>&quot;If necessary, wipe them out.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>-</span><i><span>Rommel truly is incredible.</span></i> <i><span>Look at that charisma.</span></i> <i><span>The NPCs can&#x2019;t even move their heads and are being conducted.</span></i> <i><span>That is the dignity of a general</span></i></p><p><span>-</span><i><span>The one who makes that formation is Rommel.</span></i> <i><span>He was such a person from the beginning.</span></i> <i><span>Choi Hansung was a professional gamer in the past.</span></i> <i><span>He was always an imposing friend.</span></i> <i><span>I always knew he would become big.</span></i></p><p><span>The other leaders were riding beside Choi Hansung.&#xA0;</span><span>Keynes chewed on his apple and laughed.</span></p><p><span>&quot;Disgraceful bastards are trying to use tricks to ruin the empire. Cut off the bud here. So reconciliation is no longer a choice.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;What about those who resist?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Don&apos;t be na&#xEF;ve. We have already given them enough opportunities. This price is their own fault.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Kuoong. I understand.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>-</span><i><span>That is the vice master of the Heaven and Earth Clan, Keynes.</span></i> <i><span>He was the leader of the now disappeared Thawing Balhae Clan.</span></i> <i><span>If Rommel is the field commander of Heaven and Earth, Keynes is the brain.</span></i> <i><span>The Zhuge Liang of Elder Lord!</span></i> <i><span>Then isn&#x2019;t it General Rom and Keynes Liang?</span></i> <i><span>Kelkelkel!</span></i></p><p><i><span>-General Rom and Keynes Liang!</span></i> <i><span>Those nicknames are good.</span></i> <i><span>Hahahat.</span></i></p><p><span>&#x201C;And Crockta.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span><span>Keynes said while chewing on the apple.&#xA0;</span><span>&quot;Let&apos;s show it well before he gets here. How many people will die because of him.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>-</span><i><span>Crockta!</span></i> <i><span>He is now rebelling against the empire.</span></i> <i><span>He is an NPC who entertained people&#x2019;s eyes and ears, but isn&#x2019;t his opponent the Heaven and Earth Clan?</span></i></p><p><span>-</span><i><span>It is regrettable.</span></i> <i><span>While it is difficult to make conclusions, an individual and an army are two different things.</span></i> <i><span>It is a fact that there is an objective difference in power.</span></i> <i><span>A fact.</span></i> <i><span>Perhaps Crockta&#x2019;s biography will end here...</span></i> <i><span>I feel like that.</span></i> <i><span>It is too bad.</span></i> <i><span>What would it be like if Crockta was a human and joined Heaven and Earth? I have such regrets.</span></i></p><p><span>The knights and infantry commanders nodded.&#xA0;</span><span>They retreated.&#xA0;</span><span>Now only Keynes and Rommel remained in the tent.&#xA0;</span><span>They looked at each other.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;In the end, we&#x2019;ve arrived here.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Indeed.&quot;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Let&#x2019;s make it cool. Now it is starting.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Huhu.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Rommel and Keynes fist bumped each other.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Heaven and Earth.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;War!&#x201D;</span></p><p><i><span>-Kya!</span></i> <i><span>It is wonderful.</span></i> <i><span>Heaven and Earth, war!</span></i></p><p><span>-</span><i><span>The symbol of the Heaven and Earth Clan.</span></i> <i><span>Heaven and Earth is war, war is Heaven and Earth.</span></i> <i><span>I have confidence.</span></i></p><p><span>It was a directed scene, but the viewers had already fallen into the characters and couldn&#x2019;t recognize it.&#xA0;</span><span>After the slogan, the screen slowly faded out.&#xA0;</span><span>It was a broadcast break.</span></p><p><span>-</span><i><span>This is Elder Lord, the realism!</span></i> <i><span>It is a game that maximizes the realism. </span></i><i><span>Kuhahahat, anyway, there are difficulties.</span></i></p><p><span>-</span><i><span>Why are you talking here, aren&#x2019;t you the narrator?</span></i> <i><span>Kuhuhuhu.</span></i></p><p><span>-</span><i><span>Kuhahat, I&#x2019;m sorry.</span></i> <i><span>I have a very fixed opinion.</span></i> <i><span>Huhut.</span></i> <i><span>So, friends, there are many things for you to see.</span></i> <i><span>I have to go to the bathroom.</span></i> <i><span>Then we will be having a short break.</span></i> <i><span>We will play highlights of the Heaven and Earth Clan so that viewers won&#x2019;t become bored until the broadcast starts again.</span></i></p><p><span>-</span><i><span>See you in a while.</span></i></p><p><span>The screen switched to a recorded broadcast.</span></p><p><span>Rommel appeared. The Heaven and Earth members were moving in unison under his command.&#xA0;</span><span>It was a quest where the Heaven and Earth Clan was proceeding with mass destruction. The well-trained soldiers systematically subdued the enemies.</span></p><p><span>This type of warfare was why people loved Heaven and Earth.</span></p><p></p><p style="text-align: center"><span>***</span></p><p></p><p><span>&#x201C;The commentary is too biased.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span><span>Yoon Bora complained as she watched the broadcast.&#xA0;</span><span>&#x201C;Just watch. Crockta will break the Heaven and Earth Clan.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Aren&#x2019;t there too many soldiers?&#x201D; Ban Taehoon replied.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Hey. Didn&#x2019;t he conquer the north alone? Who is Crockta?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;We didn&#x2019;t see what happened in the north so we don&#x2019;t know. If Crockta can win against that army alone, he is a god, not an orc.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Isn&#x2019;t Crockta a god?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Are you a fool?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Are you saying that to me?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Yoon Bora and Ban Taehoon started fighting. Yiyu drank her americano with a disinterested face before complaining,&#xA0;</span><span>&quot;You talk about Elder Lord every time we meet.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;You can do it too. Ah, didn&#x2019;t you die because of a rabbit?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Death.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>They were waiting for Park Jungtae.&#xA0;</span><span>During the school holidays, he went abroad to volunteer and recently came back, so they were having a gathering.&#xA0;</span><span>He was the only member who had spent the holiday elsewhere.</span></p><p><span>&quot;That&apos;s right. Didn&#x2019;t both of you eat delicious food without me?&#x201D; Ban Taehoon asked.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Uh. It was really good. I never knew kimchi and soybean paste could taste so good.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Isn&#x2019;t it petty to go without me?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Heh. You should protest to Yiyu&#x2019;s oppa?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;What is with the Oppa?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Now he is an Oppa.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span><span>Then Yoon Bora asked Yiyu.&#xA0;</span><span>&quot;By the way, is he okay?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Yes. It was nothing.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;I&apos;m glad.&quot;</span></p><p><span>At this moment, Ban Taehoon interrupted.&#xA0;</span><span>&#x201C;Hey, Jung Yiyu. You should be careful of Yoon Bora. This girl is now aiming for your brother. Look at her eyes.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Why? Are you jealous?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Uwek.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Don&#x2019;t make that sound. I will restrain you.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Then Park Jungtae appeared in the distance. He had gone to Africa so his face was tanned.&#xA0;</span><span>He looked around and smiled after finding them,&#xA0;</span><span>&#x201C;It has been a while.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Ohh Jungtae.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Did you come?&quot;</span></p><p><span>He sat down next to Ban Taehoon.&#xA0;</span><span>The two of them bumped fists, waved their fingers and bumped shoulders.</span></p><p><span>&quot;Yo man.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Wassup man.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Long time no see.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Guten tag!&#x201D; (German for good day)</span></p><p><span>Yoon Bora shook her head as she watched them babbling.&#xA0;</span><span>They hugged lightly and ended the greeting.</span></p><p><span>&quot;Did your service go well?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Yes. It was fun.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>He had gone to Africa to build houses for the poor. In other words, he was doing hard labour.&#xA0;</span><span>His body was tanned and muscular, as if he was an athlete.&#xA0;</span><span>Park Jungtae talked about the things that happened, while the rest nodded with admiration.</span></p><p><span>&quot;You really suffered.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Good work.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Park Jungtae smiled brightly at Yiyu&#x2019;s compliment.</span></p><p><span>&quot;Should we have a drink today?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Hey, did you drink there? Or did you eat anything like African snake?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;I couldn&#x2019;t drink there.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>They got up and left the cafe.</span></p><p></p><p style="text-align: center"><span>***</span></p><p></p><p><span>&quot;Heaven and Earth!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;War!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>The mounted knights moved first and broke through enemy lines. The enemy&#x2019;s formations were destroyed. The Heaven and Earth members followed behind.&#xA0;</span><span>Two infantry battalions collided.&#xA0;</span><span>The clan members shouted their slogan as they wielded their weapons.</span></p><p><span>The rebels had fallen into chaos from the cavalry penetration and couldn&#x2019;t block their attacks. Like a dam breaking, the clan members moved through the formation.&#xA0;</span><span>Their vision became blurry but they moved forward tenaciously, staring at the empire&#x2019;s flag that was flapping far away.</span></p><p><span>-</span><i><span>This is it.</span></i> <i><span>This is the power of the cavalry.</span></i><span> The rebels tried to stop them with spears and barricades, but the imperial knights weren&#x2019;t easy.</span></p><p><span>-</span><i><span>The Heaven and Earth members are also great.</span></i> <i><span>They sweep through the enemies like fallen leaves.</span></i></p><p><span>-</span><i><span>Wasn&#x2019;t it not long ago that users didn&#x2019;t dare fight NPCs?</span></i> <i><span>That has changed.</span></i> <i><span>It isn&#x2019;t an exaggeration to say that it changed after the emergence of the Heaven and Earth Clan.</span></i></p><p><span>The scene filled up the broadcast screen.&#xA0;</span><span>The rebels&#x2019; formation was destroyed by the cavalry running around. Every time the knights charged, the rebels were trampled on.&#xA0;</span><span>Then the infantry and Heaven and Earth members cleaned up the rest of the enemies.</span></p><p><span>The cavalry overran the enemies and trampled on those still on the ground.&#xA0;</span><span>There was the occasional bombardment from magicians. The rebels screamed as they were burned. The flames spread and bodies piled up.</span></p><p><span>-</span><i><span>Amazing.</span></i></p><p><span>-</span><i><span>The whole world is watching the battle of the Heaven and Earth Clan.</span></i><em><span> The number of viewers in the Undergames overseas channel is enormous.</span></em></p><p><span>All of this was being conducted by Rommel.&#xA0;</span><span>Rommel waved his hand. He took control of the battlefield, and everything was under his vision.</span></p><p><i><span>-War Maestro Rommel!</span></i><em><span> He can see the entire battlefield.</span></em></p><p><span>The commentators were proud.</span></p><p></p><p style="text-align: center"><span>***</span></p><p></p><p><span>Yoon Bora drank her beer and asked,&#xA0;</span><span>&quot;Is this a war?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Yiyu watched the broadcast from next to Yoon Bora and replied,&#xA0;</span><span>&#x201C;Yes. Aren&#x2019;t the opponents just residents, not soldiers?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Really? I guess their clothing is really shabby.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>The rebels were pushed by the empire in terms of numbers and equipment.&#xA0;</span><span>Their appearance looked like men who had been farming for all their lives.&#xA0;</span><span>They were killed in turn by the well-trained imperial army.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;It is too cruel.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;What&apos;s wrong with that? They are NPCs.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Still...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Yoon Bora opened a chat window.&#xA0;</span><span>There was also wonder and praise there.</span></p><p><span>[Dial Fresh: What is this war? It really defies my expectations.</span></p><p><span>Simabukuro: Honey jam? What are your expectations? Do you expect anyone to go against the Heaven and Earth Clan? How absurd.</span></p><p><span>Paper Cup Duo: &#x3149;&#x3149; This is the level of the Heaven and Earth Clan.</span></p><p><span>Toothbrush and Perfume: Shout General Rom!!

Is this cool? &#x314B;&#x314B;&#x314B;&#x314B;&#x314B;&#x314B; Don&#x2019;t admire murderers.</span></p><p><span>White keyboard: Dune Multiplex// I am a person who kills in the game and I can verify how fun it is.</span></p><p><span>Lukas Graham: The commentators are exaggerating &#x314B;&#x314B; The opponents are too weak.</span></p><p><span>Seven Eggs: I haven&#x2019;t watched it but I have a lot of complaints &#x3149;&#x3149; if the game is like reality, won&#x2019;t PTSD occur? &#x314B; &#x314B; &#x314B;</span></p><p><span>Storage Mistake: I agree with the one above me.]</span></p><p><span>&quot;Ah, I can&#x2019;t look.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Yoon Bora turned away from the screen.&#xA0;</span><span>Park Jungtae and Ban Taehoon&#x2019;s seats were empty.</span></p><p><span>&quot;That boy doesn&#x2019;t smoke yet he still follows.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>This was a chicken and beer pub.&#xA0;</span><span>Ban Taehoon went out for a quick smoke and the non-smoker, Park Jungtae followed. They stood side by side at the entrance of the store.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Cheers.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span><span>Yiyu and Yoon Bora made a toast.</span></p><p><span>&quot;Yiyu, isn&#x2019;t your Oppa playing Elder Lord as well?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Yes. He had been working harder lately.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Will he be watching this broadcast?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Oppa...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Yiyu started thinking.&#xA0;</span><span>It was a broadcast of a battlefield where many people died. Furthermore, it was just a one-sided massacre.</span></p><p><span>Yiyu shook her head.&#xA0;</span><span>&quot;Won&#x2019;t he really hate this?&#x201D;</span></p><p></p><p style="text-align: center"><span>***</span></p><p></p><p><span>Crockta stood in the devastated Demeterun.&#xA0;</span><span>There was nothing left.&#xA0;</span><span>The imperial troops poured the corpses into a pit and set them on fire. Now only the seared bones remained as small traces.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;......&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Adandator was silent behind Crockta.&#xA0;</span><span>He knew that the emperor had ordered Crockta&#x2019;s death. That&#x2019;s why he hurried to find Crockta.&#xA0;</span><span>If Crockta died, he would never know the identity of that light.</span></p><p><span>But Rommel had attacked Espada.&#xA0;</span><span>He knew Crockta well.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;A smart guy.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span><span>Crockta had come running as soon as he heard. But Demeterun had already been ruined.</span></p><p><span>&quot;It seems like it hasn&#x2019;t been a long time since they passed.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span><span>Alex said.</span></p><p><span>The imperial army was heading for Espada after devastating Demeterun. They would destroy everything in their way.&#xA0;</span><span>Crockta found a piece of cloth that was torn and burnt on the ground.&#xA0;</span><span>It was a flag. It was hard to see but the words &#x2018;There is no emperor in the south&#x2019; were written on it. The resistance army would&#x2019;ve swung it.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;...Let&#x2019;s go.&#xA0;</span><span>Crockta opened his mouth.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;You&#x2019;re going?&#x201D; Adandator asked.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&quot;I need to hurry before they do this again.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>The &#x2018;He&#x2019;s an Orc, yet still Praiseworthy&#x2019; members nodded.</span></p><p><span>Adandator scratched his head. He didn&#x2019;t know what he should do.&#xA0;</span><span>He had become closer to Crockta after spending a few days together, but he couldn&#x2019;t go against his kingdom.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;You can go, Adandator,&#x201D; Crockta told him.</span></p><p><span>&quot;Is it okay?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;This isn&#x2019;t your job, which is understandable.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Adandator sighed and said, &quot;I&apos;m thankful for those words.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;But I will tell you one thing,&#x201D; Crockta said as he turned to him.&#xA0;</span><span>Adandator flinched as he saw the blazing anger in Crockta&#x2019;s eyes.&#xA0;</span><span>&quot;If we meet on the battlefield, I won&#x2019;t hesitate to kill you.&#x201D;</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p><p><a href="www.wuxiaworld.com">Glossary of Common Korean Terms.</a></p><p>Praise the Orc:&#xA0;<a href="docs.google.com">Glossary Link.&#xA0;</a></p><p>Current schedule:&#xA0;There will now be 14 chapters a week, meaning two chapters every day.</p><p>I have also updated my&#xA0;<a href="www.patreon.com">Patreon</a>&#xA0;to reflect my new novels.
