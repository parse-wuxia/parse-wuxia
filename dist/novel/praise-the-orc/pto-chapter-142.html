<p><span>Chapter 142 - When I was down (2)</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p><p><span>Edgar was a member of the original Rehabilitation Brothers.&#xA0;</span><span>Those were the enjoyable days.&#xA0;</span><span>In reality, he was a youth soccer team manager who taught young talents, leading early footballers into leadership positions.&#xA0;</span><span>In Elder Lord, he enjoyed a world of fantastic adventures.&#xA0;</span><span>He became a member of the Rehabilitation Brothers, met Robina and became lovers.</span></p><p><span>However, those good days didn&#x2019;t last.</span></p><p><span>&quot;I never have good eyes for people. Isn&apos;t that right?&quot;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;......&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Robina&#x2019;s arrow flew past his cheek.&#xA0;</span><span>Edgar touched his cheek and took a step back as his past memories resurfaced.</span></p><p><span>Misfortune came without warning.&#xA0;</span><span>The students he taught were forced to leave the squad because of violence. Edgar had no backing so all of the responsibility was placed on him.&#xA0;</span><span>He hadn&#x2019;t succeeded as a player, and his dream of becoming a world-class manager was canceled. To make matters worse, the business of his parents failed and his immediate livelihood was at risk.</span></p><p><span>He didn&#x2019;t have time to play the game. He had to face reality.&#xA0;</span><span>He started work as a laborer. He also reduced the amount of time he met Robina in the game and in reality.</span></p><p><span>He tried not to but he became more sensitive.&#xA0;</span><span>Edgar started to gradually lose himself.&#xA0;</span><span>He was conscious of his shabby self as well as Robina who could fly away like a free-spirited bird at any time. He tried to ignore the cracks but the struggle cut at Edgar&#x2019;s heart.</span></p><p><span>As his lover, she quickly noticed the changes in Edgar.&#xA0;</span><span>His anxiety, his longing for her affection, and his occasional lack of confidence weren&#x2019;t part of the man that she once loved.&#xA0;</span><span>That&apos;s why Edgar confessed everything.&#xA0;</span><span>He talked about losing everything and the economic threat in front of him.</span></p><p><span>Once the story ended, Robina replied.&#xA0;</span><span>&quot;What, you became like this because of money?&#x201D;&#xA0;</span><span>She was born in a rich house so she couldn&#x2019;t understand Edgar&#x2019;s desperation.&#xA0;</span><span>&quot;Well, it is like this. It doesn&apos;t really matter anymore. We&#x2019;re finished now.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>The words stabbed his heart.</span></p><p><span>&quot;I don&#x2019;t love Oppa anymore.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>If she had shown him the same smile and comforted him, he would&#x2019;ve been able to stand up again for a short while.&#xA0;</span><span>No, if she hadn&#x2019;t broken up with him, she would&#x2019;ve been a reason for him to fight reality.</span></p><p><span>But there was no such thing.&#xA0;</span><span>Edgar collapsed. The one who gave him a chance was the Heaven and Earth Clan.&#xA0;</span><span>The Heaven and Earth Clan looked at Edgar, who was active in the Rehabilitation Brothers, and suggested he join them.</span></p><p><span>Heaven and Earth was a large clan. The clan as a whole relied on economic logic.&#xA0;</span><span>Heaven and Earth Clan members were paid and those in executive positions would be able to earn far more than before.&#xA0;</span><span>So he joined the Heaven and Earth Clan. &#xA0;Thanks to his excellent performance, he was promoted to head of the Maillard branch.</span></p><p><span>&quot;At that time, I tried to die but I didn&#x2019;t die.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Edgar muttered as he jumped forward. Robina stepped back quickly.&#xA0;</span><span>But he had no intention of a one-on-one fight with her. He turned right away and headed towards a member of the Rehabilitation Brothers.</span></p><p><span>&quot;I didn&#x2019;t die and the pain made me stronger.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>He was Edgard, Maillard&#x2019;s Heaven and Earth leader.&#xA0;</span><span>The confused Robina fired an arrow, but the shield warriors were already blocking her arrows. They persisted pursued Robina.&#xA0;</span><span>They had already heard all about her strength from Edgar, and used specialist techniques against her.</span></p><p><span>Once Robina was blocked, the rest was easy. When looking objectively, the Heaven and Earth members were far superior.</span></p><p><span>&quot;Don&#x2019;t kill as many as possible!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Edgar shouted, &quot;Use the Concrete method!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>The Concrete method, the act of imprisonment that users feared the most in Elder Lord, was declared.&#xA0;</span><span>While originally prohibited for users, it was occasionally done in warfare between opposing clans.</span></p><p><span>People protested to Elder Saga Corporation but their answer was the same as always: User freedom!</span></p><p><span>&quot;Hah, you&#x2019;re going to use the Concrete method against us? Are you insane?&#x201D; Robina shouted.</span></p><p><span>Edgar didn&#x2019;t care.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&quot;We are the Heaven and Earth Clan!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>The Heaven and Earth members shouted. The Rehabilitation Brothers started to be pushed. The Heaven and Earth members were strong because they didn&#x2019;t act individually. It was a virtue that Edgar taught them.</span></p><p><span>Now the members of the Rehabilitation Brothers were captured one by one.&#xA0;</span><span>The battle seemed like it would end with the Heaven and Earth Clan&#x2019;s victory.</span></p><p><span>&quot;I will rise up.&quot;</span></p><p><span>He would toss of the illusion of the old lover haunting him and rise to a place much higher than Robina.&#xA0;</span><span>He would succeed through Elder Lord.&#xA0;</span><span>If he kept rising in the Heaven and Earth Clan, he would someday become a ranker.</span></p><p><span>At that moment, a voice could be heard in the distance, &quot;I guess I should come out.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>It was a somewhat familiar voice.</span></p><p><span>Edgar turned his head.&#xA0;</span><span>A huge orc was hiding awkwardly behind a rock. Next to him were two figures, a small gnome and a dark elf, who were watching the fight.&#xA0;</span><span>Crockta and two unidentified people.</span></p><p><span>As Edgar made eye contact, the dark elf dropped the fried corn he was eating.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Uwah, our eyes met...cough!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Don&#x2019;t worry.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span><span>Crockta whispered to the dark elf.&#xA0;</span><span>&quot;Raise your head proudly as Crockta&#x2019;s friend.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Crockta glanced at Tiyo. Tiyo was already a proud person, so his neck was automatically stiff.&#xA0;</span><span>How wonderful. It was enough if they stood shoulder to shoulder.</span></p><p><span>Crockta nodded and raised his body.&#xA0;</span><span>It was the appearance of the superstar orc, who drove people to join an orc fan club.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Are you Crockta?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Indeed...really manly...!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>The Heaven and Earth members stopped moving. The faces of the Rehabilitation Brothers being tied up by them brightened.&#xA0;</span><span>The story that Crockta rehabilitation the three founders of the Rehabilitation Brothers had been passed down like a legend.</span></p><p><span>He hadn&#x2019;t been seen since leaving the north, but now he showed up in Maillard.&#xA0;</span><span>He was truly like the rumors.</span></p><p><span>A red headband that seemed to represent his strong will.&#xA0;</span><span>Wild eyes and a large body covered in tattoos.&#xA0;</span><span>In addition, the greatsword that was almost too big to be a sword, Ogre Slayer!&#xA0;</span><span>The appearance of an orc warrior who would make people shrink back just looking at him.</span></p><p><span>This was the founder of the Rehabilitation Brothers.</span></p><p><span>&quot;I really get to meet him...!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Get ready to be hit by Crockta!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>The atmosphere reversed once Crockta placed Ogre Slayer on his shoulders.&#xA0;</span><span>The same was true for the Heaven and Earth members. They only saw Crockta in captivity, so they never faced him with his full pressure unleashed.</span></p><p><span>Now overwhelming pressure was pouring out from him.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;That...Crockta...!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>But Edgar didn&#x2019;t back down. He took one step forward and said, &quot;You were once whining behind the steel bars, but act so brave now that you are outside.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span><span>Edgar mocked him in order to diminish Crockta&#x2019;s influence. &#xA0;</span><span>&quot;I will let you know the truth of this world, along with your rehabilitation friends. The Heaven and Earth Clan is unbeatable.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Crockta grinned.&#xA0;</span><span>He was an enemy, but Crockta liked this type of man.&#xA0;</span><span>Crockta was focused on him but Edgar desperately endured the pressure. An average person legs would&#x2019;ve already collapsed.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Edgar,&#x201D; Crockta called out to him in a soft voice.&#xA0;</span><span>&quot;You told me over a drink. A leader is a &#x2018;castle&#x2019;.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Edgar&apos;s eyes trembled.&#xA0;</span><span>Crockta was convinced. Edgar remembered what happened when he went on the drinking binge with Crockta.</span></p><p><span>&quot;I remember all the words you said when drunk. At that time, we were friends. So I am warning you in advance.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Crockta raised his greatsword.&#xA0;</span><span>It was a big sword.&#xA0;</span><span>The amount of blood that had covered it would be enough to make a sea.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;The Heaven and Earth Clan will soon perish.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;......!&quot;</span></p><p><span>It was close to a declaration of war.</span></p><p><span>&quot;I will get rid of it.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Crockta remembered many of the ruins he saw on the broadcasted videos. The Heaven and Earth Clan.&#xA0;</span><span>They spread war and famine in Elder Lord. They were multiplying the pain in this room without knowing what they were doing.</span></p><p><span>Edgar shook his head.&#xA0;</span><span>&#x201C;You alone? Don&#x2019;t make me laugh.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>At his signal, the Heaven and Earth members surrounded Crockta.&#xA0;</span><span>The members of the Rehabilitation Brothers couldn&#x2019;t fight anymore so they just watched the confrontation.</span></p><p><span>&quot;You should discover yourself if it is funny or not.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Crockta raised his greatsword.&#xA0;</span><span>His opponents had moderately large numbers.&#xA0;</span><span>But he was the warrior who slaughtered a large army in the north. In addition, he had reached the Hero realm beyond the Pinnacle.&#xA0;</span><span>This much...</span></p><p><span>&quot;Heaven and Earth!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>It was laughable.</span></p><p><span>&quot;War!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>The Heaven and Earth members rushed forward while shouting.&#xA0;</span><span>Crockta stood still and faced their assault.&#xA0;</span><span>They weren&#x2019;t a group of ragtag fighters. They were well trained soldiers in a formation that suited individuals as well as group roles.&#xA0;</span><span>Indeed, it was understandable why the Rehabilitation Brothers had suffered one-sidedly.&#xA0;</span><span>There weren&#x2019;t many groups of users with such skills.</span></p><p><span>He saw Edgar heading towards him in the lead.</span></p><p><span>&#x2018;All I needed when I fell into hell was for her to hold my hand.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span>His drunk face was overlaid on top.</span></p><p><span>&apos;But she kicked me out. I was too weak. It doesn&#x2019;t matter. I will no longer care.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span>He swung his sword.&#xA0;</span><span>The woman called Robina didn&#x2019;t know how valuable she had been to Edgar. There was no need to know.&#xA0;</span><span>The past didn&#x2019;t matter, only the fact that swords were pointed towards Crockta.&#xA0;</span><span>In any case, Edgar was a man desperately living in the present.</span></p><p><span>In order to rise to the top!</span></p><p><span>&quot;Great momentum!&quot;</span></p><p><span>Crockta shouted.&#xA0;</span><span>He didn&#x2019;t know why this guy was struggling against the world, but he liked it nevertheless.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;But it is still lacking! Bul&#x2019;tarrrrrrrrrrrrrr!&#x201D;&#xA0;</span><span>Crockta shouted and ran forward.</span></p><p><span>There were dozens of materials.&#xA0;</span><span>Crockta was like a chariot as he wielded his greatsword.&#xA0;</span><span>No one could stop him. Every time he waved his sword, users would be torn apart as their blood scattered every which way and as their bodies turned into white particles.</span></p><p><span>He looked beautiful.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;This... is Crockta.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>The members of the Rehabilitation Brothers watched him blankly.&#xA0;</span><span>Crockta was surrounded by numerous enemies. Every time he wielded his greatsword, blood poured out and white particles filled the air.</span></p><p><span>Red and white scattered in every direction around him.</span></p><p><span>They started thinking.&#xA0;</span><span>He really might end the Heaven and Earth Clan with his own hands.</span></p><p></p><p style="text-align: center"><span>***</span></p><p></p><p><span>&quot;How is it?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Now Crockta and Edgar were the only ones left.&#xA0;</span><span>The rest had turned into white particles.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;......&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Edgar couldn&apos;t say anything.&#xA0;</span><span>Now matter how great the NPC was, he hadn&#x2019;t expected them to be so overwhelmed.&#xA0;</span><span>There wasn&#x2019;t a drop of blood flowing from Crockta&#x2019;s body. He was fine, while Edgar&#x2019;s companions had been turned into white particles.</span></p><p><span>&quot;...I admit defeat.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span><span>Edgar sighed.</span></p><p><span>The end.&#xA0;</span><span>After this, he would be demoted. Gaining another opportunity wouldn&#x2019;t be easy.&#xA0;</span><span>He wanted to execute Crockta, but everything was ruined by the dumb guard Lee Jungmin. No, maybe they couldn&#x2019;t afford to go against Crockta in the first place.</span></p><p><span>No.</span></p><p><span>Edgar had a hunch.&#xA0;</span><span>The &#xA0;Heaven and Earth would disappear in the near future.&#xA0;</span><span>He watched Crockta and couldn&#x2019;t think of a way to stop this orc.&#xA0;</span><span>Would the top rankers and Choi Hansung of the Heaven and Earth Clan be able to stop this person?</span></p><p><span>&quot;It was in vain.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span><span>Edgar had barely grabbed the rope to climb up, only for it to be cut.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>Crockta called out to him, &#x201C;Edgar. I declared that I will destroy the Heaven and Earth Clan.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;......&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Then what will you do?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;......!&quot;</span></p><p><span>He looked at Crockta.&#xA0;</span><span>If this man really took down the Heaven and Earth Clan, the world of Elder Lord would be upset.&#xA0;</span><span>No one thought that Crockta could eliminate the Heaven and Earth Clan alone, but he spoke like he knew the future.</span></p><p><span>Crockta grinned.&#xA0;</span><span>&#x201C;Edgar. On that day, you said that you&#x2019;d treat me as a brother.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;I just...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;My brother.&quot;&#xA0;</span><span>Crockta came closer and whispered in his ears, &quot;I will never turn away when you fall.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;......!&quot;</span></p><p><span>&quot;I will reach out to you.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Edgar&apos;s eyes trembled.</span></p><p><span>Crockta had listened when Edgar said what he wanted.&#xA0;</span><span>Someone who would stand with him even if he fell into hell.&#xA0;</span><span>He wanted to hear that the person wouldn&#x2019;t turn away. If someone had said that to him, it wouldn&#x2019;t have been so painful.If someone had just held his hand.</span></p><p><span>Then he wouldn&#x2019;t have accepted the Heaven and Earth Clan&#x2019;s proposal.</span></p><p><span>&quot;If I had met you sooner...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Edgar closed his eyes.&#xA0;</span><span>He didn&#x2019;t regret it then, but he was regretting it now.</span></p><p><span>Edgar said to Crockta, &#x201C;Crockta.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Um.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>At that moment, Edgar pierced his own neck with his sword.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;What?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Suicide.&#xA0;</span><span>Blood flowed down his neck and he soon turned into a flurry of white particles.&#xA0;</span><span>Edgar muttered something towards Crockta just before the connection was terminated.</span></p><p><span>Crockta watched carefully.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;It was a great victory Crockta</span><i><span> dot</span></i><span>.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span><span>Tiyo said from behind him. But Crockta didn&#x2019;t move.</span></p><p><span>He thought about Edgar&#x2019;s last words.&#xA0;</span><span>Edgar had spoken without any sound.</span></p><p><span>&#x2018;Beware the Heaven and Earth Clan, Brother.&#x201D;</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p><p><a href="www.wuxiaworld.com">Glossary of Common Korean Terms.</a></p><p>Praise the Orc:&#xA0;<a href="docs.google.com">Glossary Link.&#xA0;</a></p><p>Current schedule:&#xA0;There will now be 14 chapters a week, meaning two chapters every day.</p><p>I have also updated my&#xA0;<a href="www.patreon.com">Patreon</a>&#xA0;to reflect my new novels.
