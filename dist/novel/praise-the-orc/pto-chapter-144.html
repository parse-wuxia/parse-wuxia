<p><span>Chapter 144 - Dirty South (1)</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p><p><span>Crockta gave a warm farewell to Maillard and the Rehabilitation Brothers.</span></p><p><span>Edgar had committed suicide and disconnected, but there was no news about him showing up in Maillard again.&#xA0;</span><span>Other Heaven and Earth members gradually reappeared but Edgar never showed up.</span></p><p><span>According to Robina, while he hadn&#x2019;t been an excellent user, his skills grew quickly after he entered the Heaven and Earth Clan.</span></p><p><span>The words that Ji Hayeon said to him earlier popped into his head.&#xA0;</span><span>There were people who used illegally modified capsules and drugs to increase the assimilation rate and gain profits.&#xA0;</span><span>The awakening of the drugged person would also usually depend on the contract.</span></p><p><span>Edgar might be in such a situation.&#xA0;</span><span>But Crockta had no way to get in touch with him and had to leave Maillard.</span></p><p><span>It was the true south now.</span></p><p><span>&quot;Thanks to Crockta, I was treated well.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span><span>Anor laughed.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;You are quite good</span><i><span> dot</span></i><span>. You are so popular in Maillard... of course, I am very popular in Quantes </span><i><span>dot</span></i><span>.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Crockta was an icon for the users, so the accompanying Anor and Tiyo were treated very well.</span></p><p><span>&quot;I miss the caruks.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;When the time comes, we will see them again </span><i><span>dot</span></i><span>.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>It was possible to move faster by taking horses instead of caruks.&#xA0;</span><span>The caruks were left to the Rehabilitation Brothers. The caruks, who had great advantages in the desert area, weren&#x2019;t useful in the continent. In the Rehabilitation Brothers, they were taken care of as &#x2018;Crockta&#x2019;s mount.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span>&quot;This is the first time I am going to the south </span><i><span>dot</span></i><span>.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;How come?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;It is the land of humans.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>There are many humans in the south.&#xA0;</span><span>The northwest of the continent was a harsh place where orcs and creatures lived, while the northeast was the land of the elves, dark elves and gnomes. The south of the continent was where humans lived together.</span></p><p><span>It was the most populated, fiercest and disruptive land, the south.&#xA0;</span><span>In particular, the center of the continent contained many species due to its geographic location, meaning there were occasional fights among species.</span></p><p><span>They had to pass through it to arrive in the south.&#xA0;</span><span>Tiyo wanted to meet his father Hedor while Crockta was trying to completely eliminate the remnants of the Thawing Balhae Clan, who had joined the Heaven and Earth Clan.</span></p><p><span>And Anor had no thoughts.&#xA0;</span><span>&#x201C;What does the food in the south taste like? Won&#x2019;t there be an abundance of hot and fat foods? Many fruits as well. Hahaha.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span><span>He chuckled from aboard his horse.&#xA0;</span><span>&#x201C;Look. There are many new creatures on the continent!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Anor stretched out his hand and bones started to rise.&#xA0;</span><span>It was a strange bipedal creature.</span></p><p><span>&quot;Lay it down again</span><i><span> dot</span></i><span>!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Why? The bones are fresh as it just died.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;It is unsightly </span><i><span>dot.</span></i><span>&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;This is discrimination. Tiyo will be like this when you die.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;......&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Tiyo fired General at the bones.&#xA0;</span><span>The bones were smashed to pieces.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Ah! My bones!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;The dead have no words.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Too much...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Crockta smiled as he watched them, but he soon fixed his expression.&#xA0;</span><span>He started to feel something from the forest they were riding through. There were presences moving here and there simultaneously.&#xA0;</span><span>The movements were too sudden for them to be people passing by.</span></p><p><span>As they rode along the path, the video of White Knight Andre, no Baek Hanho popped into his head.&#xA0;</span><span>He annihilated all the bandits and declared war against Crockta.</span></p><p><span>That&#x2019;s right.&#xA0;</span><span>Bandits!</span></p><p><span>&quot;It is started once again. Kulkul.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span><span>Crockta laughed as he turned to Tiyo and Anor.&#xA0;</span><span>&quot;Shall we take a break?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;That&apos;s right. IT has been a while. I want to rest. Isn&#x2019;t it hard?&#x201D;&#xA0;</span><span>Anor replied while patting his horse&#x2019;s mane.</span></p><p><span>Tiyo smiled at Crockta.&#xA0;</span><span>&#x201C;I don&#x2019;t think I should sweat before resting </span><i><span>do</span></i><span>t.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;If you sweat from this then you are weak.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;I won&#x2019;t sweat </span><i><span>dot</span></i><span>.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>At that moment, Tiyo twisted his body and fired General.&#xA0;</span><span>A bandit hiding behind a tree was hit by General and flew in the air. He bumped into another tree and fell to the ground with a groan.</span></p><p><span>&quot;Bandits can only make me sweat a little around my eyes</span><i><span> do</span></i><span>t!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Tiyo had already noticed the approach of the bandits.</span></p><p><span>&quot;Cover everything!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>At Tiyo&#x2019;s attack, the bandits jumped out and rushed towards them.&#xA0;</span><span>Anor, who had no idea what was going on, screamed and hid behind Crockta and Tiyo.</span></p><p><span>&quot;They are gnats</span><i><span> dot</span></i><span>.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Crockta got off his horse while Tiyo showed brilliant marksmanship while holding the reins of his horse.</span></p><p><span>&quot;Iyat! Iyat! Kiyooh!&#x201D;</span></p><p><i><span>Chong!</span></i> <i><span>Chong!</span></i> <i><span>Chong!</span></i><span> Tiyo&#x2019;s magic bullets accurately knocked down the bandits approaching.</span></p><p><span>Crockta also wielded his greatsword.&#xA0;</span><span>However, he hesitated and didn&#x2019;t attack anymore.</span></p><p><span>&quot;......!&quot;</span></p><p><span>The enemies&#x2019; weapons were terrible.&#xA0;</span><span>Some of them were stepping awkwardly while holding farm equipment. Some held swords or spears, but their eyes were terrified.</span></p><p><span>The man in the front exclaimed.&#xA0;</span><span>&quot;I-I-If you leave what you have, w-we won&#x2019;t kill you!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>It was a pathetic voice.&#xA0;</span><span>He realized they weren&#x2019;t a match after seeing their companions knocked down because of Tiyo, but he spoke the threat because there was no room to back off.</span></p><p><span>&quot;I only have this.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span><span>Crockta pointed his greatsword.</span></p><p><span>There was no need to fight. Tiyo also stopped firing General.</span></p><p><span>&quot;What </span><i><span>dot</span></i><span>? Sorry I hit you </span><i><span>dot</span></i><span>.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;These bandits have no killing intent. They are bandits but...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>As the clouds moved, bright sunshine fell in the forest.&#xA0;</span><span>The shadows of the forest were removed, revealing Crockta&#x2019;s form.</span></p><p><span>The bandits were stunned. &#xA0;</span><span>A huge size and rugged face. The fearsome greatsword.&#xA0;</span><span>The opponent was much more vicious than they imagined.&#xA0;</span><span>Crockta looked at them without saying anything. The bandits stepped back at his gaze.&#xA0;</span><span>The tattoos covering the body and the terrible belt at his waist made him seem like a demon.</span></p><p><span>The person in the lead bowed first.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;W-We&#x2019;re really sorry!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>The other bandits identified the situation and also bowed while begging for mercy.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;We&#x2019;re sorry!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Spare us!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;It is hard to eat and live!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Bowing to the overwhelming enemy!&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>Tiyo hit Crockta&#x2019;s waist.&#xA0;</span><span>&#x201C;Smile a bit </span><i><span>dot.</span></i><span>&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;......&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Tiyo had a point. He didn&#x2019;t look so scary when smiling. A nasty person wouldn&#x2019;t smile.</span></p><p><span>Crockta smiled at them and said.&#xA0;</span><span>&#x201C;Stand up.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>The reaction was explosive.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Hiik! We&#x2019;re sorry! Spare us!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;My wife and children are waiting for me!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Sir Orc! Mercy!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Crockta glanced at Tiyo. He shrugged and immediately changed his words.</span></p><p><span>&quot;You should&#x2019;ve left it as before. Look the way you want </span><i><span>dot</span></i><span>.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;......&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Anor came forward and helped them up.&#xA0;</span><span>&#x201C;Phew. Stand up. This person looks like a serial killer but he isn&#x2019;t bad. Stand up. It&#x2019;s okay.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>He was wearing a dark robe, but as soon as the dark elf Anor appeared, they started to recover.</span></p><p><span>&quot;Pff. Anyway, life is unfair </span><i><span>dot</span></i><span>. Pffft.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Tiyo giggled. </span></p><p><span>Crockta muttered,&#xA0;</span><span>&#x201C;...Kid.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;W-What did you say </span><i><span>dot</span></i><span>?! Say it to me!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;I didn&#x2019;t say anything.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Don&#x2019;t lie </span><i><span>dot</span></i><span>! You called me a kid </span><i><span>dot</span></i><span>!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;You heard wrong.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Eek!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Tiyo jumped and clung to Crockta. He tried to place Crockta in a headlock, but he just looked like a child hanging on.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;What are you doing now? These kids.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span><span>Anor muttered as he stared at them.&#xA0;</span><span>&quot;Is this the right time?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;T-Then?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Listen to these people&#x2019;s stories! Go and talk to them!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Um...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>There weren&#x2019;t many bandits in this area, which was the north of the continent. It was so peaceful that people hardly ever turned to the criminal path.&#xA0;</span><span>But this happened as soon as they headed south.&#xA0;</span><span>The south might be different from the continent that they had experienced.</span></p><p><span>&quot;I&apos;ll do that.&quot;</span></p><p><span>Crockta completely recognized Elder Lord as a real world.&#xA0;</span><span>In the world of Elder Lord, he had power.&#xA0;</span><span>In other words, a Hero.&#xA0;</span><span>With great power comes great responsibility, so he wanted to help people who were in need.&#xA0;</span><span>He should find out their circumstances.</span></p><p><span>The bandits&#x2019; eyes widened.</span></p><p></p><p style="text-align: center"><span>***</span></p><p></p><p><span>They were residents of a small village in the forest.&#xA0;</span><span>They didn&#x2019;t have much, but it was still a life of freedom. Then one day, an existence appeared that took all of that away from them.</span></p><p><span>Knights.</span></p><p><span>&quot;They told us to follow the Emperor.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Emperor?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Yes.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span><span>One bandit said. He was their leader called Hans.&#xA0;</span><span>&quot;As you know, there is no emperor on the continent. It is an unwritten rule. The advent of an emperor had always led to the persecution of other species.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;But someone is calling himself an emperor?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Yes. The knights are gathering villagers and farmers like us under the emperor&#x2019;s name. They speak nice words but we will be serfs. It is no different from slavery. So we refused.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Once they refused, the knights turned like they had been waiting and devastated the village. Anyone who rebelled was killed.&#xA0;</span><span>In the end, they had nothing left and become bandits attacking adventurers and merchants in order to survive.&#xA0;</span><span>However, their combat power was weak so they were often defeated.</span></p><p><span>&quot;It is our fault but our children are starving...sorry.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;You don&#x2019;t need to apologize.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Crockta&#x2019;s group reached their home.&#xA0;</span><span>The elderly, women, and children poked their heads out from tents in the forest.&#xA0;</span><span>They looked frightened at the sudden appearance of a heinous orc.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Umm...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>All of them were starving and their ribs poked out from underneath their skin. In particular, the children&apos;s conditions were serious.</span></p><p><span>Hans sighed, </span><span>&quot;We are eating fruit in the forest and hunting, but...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Tiyo clicked his tongue.</span></p><p><span>&quot;What are these knights doing </span><i><span>dot</span></i><span>? The emperor of where?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;The king of Esperanza.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;The king had a change of heart...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>In the case of orcs, each city was operated independently. The elves were similar to orcs, but they were weakly connected by the world tree. Gnomes regularly voted for their representative.</span></p><p><span>In the case of humans, there were royalty and nobles. However, the king&#x2019;s power wasn&#x2019;t strong and he was mainly regarded as a symbolic entity representing the nobles. Something seemed to have changed.</span></p><p><span>The advent of an emperor would shake the entire continent.</span></p><p><span>&quot;It is unknown if the other species know about this.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;If he does this, they will probably find out </span><i><span>dot</span></i><span>. But this is serious </span><i><span>dot</span></i><span>.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Anor&#x2019;s ears pricked,&#xA0;</span><span>&quot;The emperor...is he like the orc&#x2019;s great chieftain?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Yes </span><i><span>dot</span></i><span>.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Then do we have to worry? Don&#x2019;t we have the great chieftain here?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Ah! That&#x2019;s right </span><i><span>dot</span></i><span>! The great chieftain...oof!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Tiyo and Anor tried to tease Crockta again.&#xA0;</span><span>Crockta quickly blocked their mouths and said, &quot;Anyway, this is a pitiful situation...I want to help.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;How </span><i><span>dot</span></i><span>?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;This much...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Crockta looked at the residents. There weren&#x2019;t many of them because they were originally a village.&#xA0;</span><span>The Rehabilitation Brothers could afford this number.&#xA0;</span><span>Besides, the Rehabilitation Brothers were formed for the purpose of helping others. They would also listen if Crockta asked them to do it.</span></p><p><span>Crockta told them, &quot;Go to Maillard.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Huh? Maillard?&#x201D; Hans questioned.&#xA0;</span><span>He became even more polite after hearing the name Crockta.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;There are people in Maillard who will help you out.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Do you mean us?&#x201D; Who...?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;My friends are known as the Rehabilitation Brothers.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Rehabilitation Brothers?&quot;</span></p><p><span>Hans was dubious.&#xA0;</span><span>&#x201C;But Maillard isn&#x2019;t close. It won&#x2019;t be easy to reach there...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>They had to worry about the daily meals. Crockta shook his head as if telling them not to worry.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Here.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Crockta pulled out some gold coins.&#xA0;</span><span>He had become a top ranked player while playing the game and could afford at least this much.</span></p><p><span>&quot;This...!&quot;</span></p><p><span>Han&#x2019;s eyes widened.&#xA0;</span><span>For ordinary people, gold coins were worth a huge amount of money. Crockta pulled out several, not just one, and placed them in Hans&#x2019; hands.</span></p><p><span>&quot;Why is this...?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>He didn&#x2019;t put away the gold coins on his palm as he stared blankly at Crockta. &#xA0;Crockta scratched his nose and shrugged.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;A warrior shouldn&#x2019;t turn a blind eye to those in distress.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;......!&quot;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Just take it. The gold coins are just shining stones to me. I can spare a few stones if it saves you from starving!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Hans was thrilled.&#xA0;</span><span>&quot;Ahh...please forgive me for taking this. Crockta!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Don&#x2019;t do that.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;I wouldn&#x2019;t be willing if it wasn&#x2019;t for the children! Thank you!&quot;</span></p><p><span>Crockta raised him up.&#xA0;</span><span>As the two were talking, the villagers started to falter.</span></p><p><span>Tiyo was the first one to notice.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;......?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Tiyo suddenly felt horseshoes approaching. The village residents were terrified when they looked to one side.&#xA0;</span><span>He followed their gaze to see a group of humans.&#xA0;</span><span>The humans were mounted and in full-body armor. They held lances and swords.</span></p><p><span>Knights.</span></p><p><span>&quot;Now, are you willing to follow the emperor?&#x201D;</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p><p><a href="www.wuxiaworld.com">Glossary of Common Korean Terms.</a></p><p>Praise the Orc:&#xA0;<a href="docs.google.com">Glossary Link.&#xA0;</a></p><p>Current schedule:&#xA0;There will now be 14 chapters a week, meaning two chapters every day.</p><p>I have also updated my&#xA0;<a href="www.patreon.com">Patreon</a>&#xA0;to reflect my new novels.
