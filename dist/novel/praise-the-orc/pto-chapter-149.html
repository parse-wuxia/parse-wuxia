<p><span>Chapter 149 - Great Duel (3)</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p><p><span>Yellow lived in Alaste and realized that someone had visited her bedside last night.&#xA0;</span><span>There was a letter on the desk next to her bed.</span></p><p><span>She got goosebumps as she checked the letter.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;This...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>She wondered who sent it. The author didn&#x2019;t state their identity, as only a few things were mentioned.&#xA0;</span><span>However, it contained something shocking that she had never considered at all.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;No way,&#x201D; she murmured.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Perhaps?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>But it made sense.&#xA0;</span><span>She read the letter once again before exiting Elder Lord.</span></p><p></p><p style="text-align: center"><span>***</span></p><p></p><p><span>Crockta sat in front of a fireplace with VIgo.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;I didn&#x2019;t see Yellow today. Was she dragged by the call of the stars? I truly feel sorry for that friend.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>The NPCs understood the concept of disconnection as the users being summoned to the abyss.&#xA0;</span><span>In a way, it wasn&#x2019;t wrong. Going back and forth between Elder Lord and Earth.&#xA0;</span><span>This situation often happened so users found it hard to have a close relationship with NPCs. It was hard to trust those who suddenly disappeared ahead of important things.</span></p><p><span>Therefore, users who couldn&#x2019;t connect for long tended to only socialize with other users. This was because NPCs didn&#x2019;t trust them.</span></p><p><span>&quot;Yellow is normally good so this is surprising.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Of course, Yellow was excellent in Elder Lord. She had been living like an NPC for nearly a year.&#xA0;</span><span>This allowed her to move up to the position of working for the lord.</span></p><p><span>&quot;I guess she has something to do.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span><span>Crockta smiled strangely.</span></p><p><span>She probably ended the connection after reading the letter that Crockta sent her at night.&#xA0;</span><span>He wasn&#x2019;t sure if it would work, but he needed to do what he could.&#xA0;</span><span>The kingdom&#x2019;s path involved the Heaven and Earth Clan. It was already a public fact and there was a precedent where they devastated any areas in the name of the kingdom.</span></p><p><span>In particular, the southeast region with no clear system was brutally destroyed and the ruins broadcasted several times.&#xA0;</span><span>The Heaven and Earth Clan didn&#x2019;t keep faith with NPCs.&#xA0;</span><span>As long as they considered Elder Lord a game, Crockta needed to extend this duel agreement not only to NPCs but users as well.</span></p><p><span>&quot;By the way, what are they doing?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Vigo turned his head at Crockta&#x2019;s words.&#xA0;</span><span>In the meantime, Grandmaster Galadin and Anor were staring at each other.</span></p><p><span>&quot;Ohhh...&quot;</span></p><p><span>Anor, who was very timid and not good with eye contact, desperately tried to turn his head away with red cheeks.&#xA0;</span><span>It looked so funny that Tiyo joined Galadin in staring at Anor.&#xA0;</span><span>As the eyes of the two people focused on him, Anor turned his eyes towards his hands.</span></p><p><span>&quot;I got it. Stop! Stop!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Galadin and Tiyo chuckled.</span></p><p><span>&quot;You will be stronger if you don&#x2019;t avoid the eyes of others.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Tiyo approached,&#xA0;</span><span>&quot;In other words, don&#x2019;t act like this forever </span><i><span>dot</span></i><span>! Kahahat!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Ahyu.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span><span>Anor seemed like he was about to cry.&#xA0;</span><span>&quot;It is strange when you keep staring.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;You are very shy. Don&#x2019;t avoid other people&#x2019;s eyes. It is a shame. Hahat!&#x201D;&#xA0;</span><span>Galadin was famous for identifying people&#x2019;s characteristics and leading them to the right path.</span></p><p><span>Crockta seemed to know the secret after exchanging blows with him.&#xA0;</span><span>Galadin had the ability to read inner thoughts, like he was telepathic.&#xA0;</span><span>During the spar, he predicted all of Crockta&#x2019;s moves. There was the feeling that he knew in advance every move Crockta was going to do and could cope with it.</span></p><p><span>Crockta won, but he wasn&#x2019;t sure the results would be the same if they really tried to kill each other.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;He is a mysterious person.&#x201D; Crockta stated.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;That is correct. A mysterious person. He looks inside people.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>If he could really see into a person&#x2019;s heart, he would be able to find out their problems.&#xA0;</span><span>His teachings were about inner matters, rather than technical ones.</span></p><p><span>Crockta also received advice from him.</span></p><p><span>&quot;What did he say to Brother? If you don&#x2019;t mind, please let me know. I am curious. Is a warrior like you lacking anything?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Um...&#x201D;&#xA0;</span><span>Crockta recalled Galadin&#x2019;s words.&#xA0;</span><span>&#x201C;Just...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Vigo was right.</span></p><p><span>Galadin wasn&#x2019;t just a person who strengthened knights.&#xA0;</span><span>When wielding a sword, he was an aggressive knight. But after putting it away, he looked at the other person with warm eyes.&#xA0;</span><span>He was someone who caused the other person to grow as a human.</span></p><p><span>&quot;He told me not to shoulder everything alone.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Oh, indeed. Brother has something.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span><span>Vigo raised his thumb.&#xA0;</span><span>&quot;Doesn&#x2019;t he feel like a father when he says that?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Crockta laughed. His father passed away but memories from his childhood still remained. He never resented his parents.&#xA0;</span><span>In life, how many people had the strength to look straight at themselves?</span></p><p><span>&quot;That&#x2019;s right.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Now it was Tiyo&#x2019;s turn to receive advice from Galadin.&#xA0;</span><span>However, Tiyo disliked this and refused his advice.&#xA0;</span><span>An angry Galadiin wielded his sword. Tiyo ran away.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Stop </span><i><span>dot</span></i><span>! I understand! I understand </span><i><span>dot</span></i><span>!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;This guy! Listen to the adults!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;I am an adult </span><i><span>dot</span></i><span>!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;If you are an adult, listen to a real adult!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;I am a gnome! General, General!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;General? Shoot it once!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Kiyak!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Tiyo screamed as he ran away from Galadin&#x2019;s wooden sword.&#xA0;</span><span>Crockta and Vigo burst out laughing as they saw it.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Phew. Truly.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>The still embarrassed Anor was fanning himself as he walked towards Crockta.</span></p><p><span>&quot;We have to watch you for you to grow. Isn&#x2019;t it?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;......&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;......&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;...Excuse me?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Vigo and Crockta stared at Anor, mimicking Galadin and Tiyo from earlier.</span></p><p><span>Anor blushed.&#xA0;</span><span>&quot;No, now...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>They diligently gazed at Anor&#x2019;s face.&#xA0;</span><span>Anor was embarrassed and covered his face.&#xA0;</span><span>&quot;Don&#x2019;t do it! Ah!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Anor&#x2019;s face turned bright red as he ran somewhere else.</span></p><p><span>&quot;Anor Brother is both handsome and cute. The females will like him.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Kulkulkul.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>It was enjoyable.&#xA0;</span><span>Alaste was a vibrant city filled with laughter.&#xA0;</span><span>Whether it was the nature of the people or the richness of the natural environment, they seemed to enjoy each moment.&#xA0;</span><span>Of course, it wasn&#x2019;t just due to material reasons that laughter was gradually disappearing from the prosperous modern age compared to Elder Lord.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Vigo. You were right.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;What do you mean?&quot;&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Alaste is a wonderful place.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Of course. I don&#x2019;t lie! Hahahat! Viva Alaste!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Kulkulkul!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>In a matter of days, Crockta had explored all over Alaste.&#xA0;</span><span>Every time he walked through a city, Crockta felt fear towards him, whether it was because he was an orc or his frightening appearance.&#xA0;</span><span>In fact, he wasn&#x2019;t a real orc but a human being wearing the shell of an orc. However, there were still negative prejudices towards his shell.</span></p><p><span>But Alaste was different.&#xA0;</span><span>The children came to play with Crockta while merchants added orc goods.&#xA0;</span><span>He felt like a welcomed guest.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Brother. Now you know. Why I kept hanging onto you, despite it being the first time we met.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span><span>Vigo placed a hand on Crockta&#x2019;s shoulder and gazed into the distance.&#xA0;</span><span>&quot;The kingdom and Adandator is trying to destroy such a beautiful place.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Once incorporated into the kingdom, this landscape would disappear. The citizens would suffer under heavy taxes and young people would be conscripted for war.&#xA0;</span><span>The lands under the kingdom&#x2019;s reign were already going through this process.</span></p><p><span>Crockta nodded.&#xA0;</span><span>&quot;I heard that Adandator is a handsome, young man.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Yes. His face is famous.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Then I&#x2019;ll beat him up and make him look worse than me!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Crockta shouted.&#xA0;</span><span>It was Crockta&#x2019;s declaration that he would protect Alaste with his best efforts!</span></p><p><span>But Vigo wasn&#x2019;t very impressed by the remark.&#xA0;</span><span>&quot;No matter how much you hit him, it will be difficult...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;......&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Crockta&#x2019;s face stiffened. Vigo hurriedly changed his words.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Ah, no. I believe in Brother!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;It is okay. I&#x2019;ll fight in the duel...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;What are you talking about? Brother&#x2019;s face is better than his. Really! I&#x2019;m not lying!&#x201D;</span></p><p></p><p style="text-align: center"><span>***</span></p><p></p><p><span>The Elder Lord community had recently heated up because of a new topic.&#xA0;</span><span>And the one at the heart of the topic was the Heaven and Earth Clan.</span></p><p><span>[Author: Yellow Alaste]</span></p><p><span>[Title: Announcing the negotiations between those who love Alaste and the Heaven and Earth Clan.]</span></p><p><span>[Hello. I am a native of Alaste, Yellow who loves Alaste.</span></p><p><span>The human kingdom is expanding its forces in recent years. The Alaste that I love is in crisis but most users don&#x2019;t know exactly what is happening.&#xA0;</span><span>The kingdom and Alaste have decided to settle their fighting in a one-on-one duel through their respective representatives.</span></p><p><span>We can settle this without having to fight against each other.</span></p><p><span>If the kingdom wins, Alaste will be incorporated into the kingdom. If Alaste wins, it will remain independent as a neutral city and the kingdom won&#x2019;t invade Alaste in the future.</span></p><p><span>In fact, the possibility of us winning is low. Even though we have Grandmaster Galadin, the kingdom has the famous Adandator. However, the users who love Alaste are eager for a miracle to happen.</span></p><p><span>Anyway, the reason I am writing this is to plead with the Heaven and Earth Clan.&#xA0;</span><span>There are users who regard NPCs as consumables, mere artificial intelligence and doesn&#x2019;t feel any remorse. The Heaven and Earth Clan especially has such tendencies.</span></p><p><span>So we are worried that even if Galadin and Alaste wins, the Heaven and Earth Clan will ignore the existing negotiations and hit Alaste.&#xA0;</span><span>Users often do this, not just the Heaven and Earth Clan. People will know this.&#xA0;</span><span>But we are users who love Alaste, and we hope that the users, including the Heaven and Earth Clan, will accept the result.</span></p><p><span>Therefore, we have asked the Heaven and Earth Clan to sign a memorandum stating that they will comply with the agreement between Alaste and the kingdom.&#xA0;</span><span>Heaven and Earth&#x2019;s clan master Choi Hansung has agreed.</span></p><p><span>This is the actual memorandum.</span></p><p><span>(Screenshot)</span></p><p><span>I am posting this here because I hope that all users who enjoy Elder Lord will be the notaries of this memorandum.</span></p><p><span>We don&#x2019;t want Elder Lord to be ruined by a reckless war.</span></p><p><span>If there are hundreds of users, there are hundreds of ways to play. I fell in love with Alaste from the first moment I saw it. Alaste is a really beautiful place. I used to always brag about it and I am still proud.</span></p><p><span>If Alaste is defeated, I will probably disappear from this forum. I will also delete my character. There is no reason to play.&#xA0;</span><span>If there are people who want to continue seeing it like me, please pray with us.</span></p><p><span>I hope for a miracle.</span></p><p><span>Alaste Lover, Yellow.]</span></p><p><span>Yellow posted on a famous community board.&#xA0;</span><span>This article immediately became a hot topic.</span></p><p><span>The first reason was that the greatest knights in Elder Lord, two grandmasters were having a confrontation. Another reason was that the author was Yellow, a user who managed to become a senior official.</span></p><p><span>Yellow was the user whose name became famous with an Elder Lord strategy guide.&#xA0;</span><span>Users who wanted to become civil servants in Elder Lord would regard her guide as a textbook. In addition, she introduced users to the calm lifestyle of Alaste and made many users turn to Alaste.</span></p><p><span>Her article became a hot topic and thousands of comments had already been posted.</span></p><p><span>The Heaven and Earth Clan also confirmed her post.</span></p><p></p><p style="text-align: center"><span>***</span></p><p></p><p><span>&#x201C;Is it okay?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Hyunchul, &#x2018;Luin&#x2019; in Elder Lord said.&#xA0;</span><span>After helping to lure and kill Lenox, he was now an executive in the Heaven and Earth Clan.&#xA0;</span><span>In addition, using his friendship with the NPCs and Choi Hansung, Keynes went from being the clan master of Thawing Balhae to the vice clan master of Heaven and Earth.</span></p><p><span>The clan master was &#x2018;Rommel&#x2019; but most of the clan&#x2019;s actions came from Keynes&#x2019; head.</span></p><p><span>&quot;There&apos;s nothing to worry about.&quot;</span></p><p><span>Rommel smiled and drank his wine.&#xA0;</span><span>This was the clan dwelling in the capital, Esperanza. It was a land they had received directly after gaining the favor of the king.&#xA0;</span><span>The room they were talking in was luxurious and wasn&#x2019;t lacking when compared to a noble&#x2019;s house. All of this was due to the members of Thawing Balhae who joined Heaven and Earth.</span></p><p><span>&quot;Do you really think Adandator can be beaten?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Indeed...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;He is a monster. I&#x2019;ve talked to Adandator and he is confident that he can beat Galadin. Galadin is old and Adandator has already reached a new level.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;I&#x2019;m glad that monster isn&#x2019;t our enemy.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;I completely agree. So don&apos;t worry. The woman thinks it will work, but it will end without a problem.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span><span>Rommel handed the wine glass to Keynes who was sitting silently. Keynes smiled and received it.&#xA0;</span><span>&#x201C;Why aren&#x2019;t you saying anything?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;There is something that bothers me.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Keynes&#x2019; nerves were sharp after the Maillard branch of the clan collapsed.&#xA0;</span><span>All of Maillard&#x2019;s members mentioned the NPC called Crockta. Everyone knew that the Thawing Balhae had been destroyed by the Righteous Orc.&#xA0;</span><span>A coincidence? Or maybe he was chasing after them in the Heaven and Earth Clan.</span></p><p><span>&quot;Don&#x2019;t worry about it. You are here now.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Yes.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Keynes nodded. Even so, he couldn&#x2019;t help being worried. Rommel laughed.</span></p><p><span>&quot;Keynes, you are always worrying.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Luin suddenly said, &quot;Speaking of worrying, what will happen if Adandator is beaten?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Um...well, it can&#x2019;t be helped. I actually thought about ignoring it but then that girl made the post.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Yellow&#x2019;s head is quite good.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;It&#x2019;s a last hurrah. Anyway, Adandator will win. Now, drink.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Rommel, Luin, Keynes, and the other high ranking members of the Heaven and Earth Clan nodded. </span><span>They raised their cups at the same time and shouted, &quot;Heaven and Earth!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;War!&#x201D;</span></p><p></p><p style="text-align: center"><span>***</span></p><p></p><p><span>A few days later on a sunny day, both the Lord of Alaste and the King of the Kingdom led their knights out on the Gabriel Plains located not too far from Alaste.</span></p><p><span>It was for the great duel.</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p><p>This month&apos;s Q&amp;A will take place in approximately 6 hours on the Wuxiaworld&apos;s discord.</p><p><a href="www.wuxiaworld.com">Glossary of Common Korean Terms.</a></p><p>Praise the Orc:&#xA0;<a href="docs.google.com">Glossary Link.&#xA0;</a></p><p>Current schedule:&#xA0;There will now be 14 chapters a week, meaning two chapters every day.</p><p>I have also updated my&#xA0;<a href="www.patreon.com">Patreon</a>&#xA0;to reflect my new novels.
