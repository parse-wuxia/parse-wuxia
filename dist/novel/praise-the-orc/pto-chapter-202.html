The loser will pay. My stomach will burst tonight.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Don&#x2019;t run away either.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>They were talking together in giddy voices.</span></p><p><i><span>Chwaaaak!</span></i></p><p><span>There was the sound of liquid splattering.&#xA0;</span><span>It came from somewhere else.&#xA0;</span><span>From the big screen!&#xA0;</span><span>The expedition collided with Crockta and a fountain of blood rose.&#xA0;</span><span>Then Crockta&#x2019;s roar rang out through the bar, bursting out from the speakers.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Truly Crockta!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Crockta is the best!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Those who supported Crockta started cheering.&#xA0;</span><span>He was the head of a tsunami that aimed at the expedition.</span></p><p><span>&quot;Hey, is this fun as well?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Yoon Bora suddenly pointed to her tablet screen and asked.&#xA0;</span><span>The sound wasn&#x2019;t heard due to the crowded bar, but she was watching a BJ who participated in the battle directly and was relaying the war situation.</span></p><p><span>He joined on the side of the expedition. He faced the orcs.</span></p><p><span>&quot;It is overwhelming with realism.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>The BJ gasped and told the viewers.</span></p><p><span>-</span><i><span>Heok, heok, Brother!</span></i> <i><span>Look at this!</span></i> <i><span>The orcs have such fearsome faces!</span></i> <i><span>It seems that BJ Jungmin will die today!</span></i> <i><span>Viewers, please shoot me some donations!</span></i> <i><span>I will die.</span></i> <i><span>I&#x2019;m too scared to move my feet, but I will do it for you!</span></i></p><p><span>Yoon Bora started typing.</span></p><p><span>[Bora Doridori: Approach Crockta! Here is a donation! Show me Crockta!]</span></p><p><span>[Bora Doridori has shot 10 moon balloons] (TL: Forgot to mention this earlier. BJ= Broadcasting Jockey. They can get donations by viewers sending them balloons, which is equal to money).</span></p><p><span>-</span><i><span>Heeok!</span></i> <i><span>Viewer!</span></i> <i><span>Thank you!</span></i> <i><span>Reaction!</span></i> <i><span>Hah!</span></i></p><p><span>BJ Jungmin tried to enter the war.&#xA0;</span><span>The viewers watched BJ Jungmin as he was pushed over by the expedition troops running from behind.&#xA0;</span><span>As the screen twisted, they were greeted by the sight of troops crossing above BJ Jungmin.</span></p><p><span>-</span><i><span>Keheok!</span></i> <i><span>It hurts...but I still love the viewers!</span></i> <i><span>Bora Doridori, what should I do?</span></i></p><p><span>Yoon Bora cried out.</span></p><p><span>[Bora Doridori: Keep going towards Crockta!]</span></p><p><span>-</span><i><span>I understand, Viewer Bora!</span></i> <i><span>Please keep watching!</span></i> <i><span>BJ Jungmin is going!</span></i></p><p><span>He rose again and started to move towards Crockta with his weapon. His weapon was a rapier.</span></p><p><span>-</span><i><span>I can see Crockta!</span></i> <i><span>Look at that!</span></i></p><p><span>In the middle of the battlefield, there was a place where the heads of people kept exploding.&#xA0;</span><span>The appearance of modern firearms in the world of Elder Lord!&#xA0;</span><span>Every time an explosive sound was heard, flesh would fly into the sky. The terrified expeditionary forces didn&#x2019;t dare go near.</span></p><p><span>&quot;Don&apos;t be afraid, fight!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Aklan shouted from behind as he tried to raise morale.</span></p><p><i><span>-Oh, there are so many people!</span></i> <i><span>I can&#x2019;t just watch from behind!</span></i> <i><span>No!</span></i> <i><span>Viewers!</span></i> <i><span>BJ Jungmin will go forward, so receive me!</span></i> <i><span>I am prepared to die!</span></i> <i><span>I am a dead man living!</span></i> <i><span>So the balloons...!</span></i></p><p><span>[Bora Doridori: Stop chattering and go! I have sent balloons!]</span></p><p><span>-</span><i><span>Yes!</span></i> <i><span>I&#x2019;m going!</span></i></p><p><span>BJ Jungmin moved through the expedition troops and headed to the front of the battlefield, to the &#x2018;Crockta Zone.&#x2019;&#xA0;</span><span>Nobody approached Crockta so the space around him was empty.&#xA0;</span><span>At that moment, Crockta&#x2019;s terrifying face as he killed people with the greatsword was revealed.</span></p><p><span>-</span><i><span>Heeoook!</span></i></p><p><span>BJ Jungmin breathed in.&#xA0;</span><span>It was the same for everyone looking at his video. Yoon Bora&#x2019;s friends gathered around her.</span></p><p><span>Killing intent.&#xA0;</span><span>It felt like the sword was being pushed into their necks.&#xA0;</span><span>Crockta&#x2019;s eyes were bloodshot. A light shone from beneath the helmet.&#xA0;</span><span>His whole body was soaked with blood and the greatsword waved at the enemies.&#xA0;</span><span>A messenger who dealt death without any hesitation.</span></p><p><span>Thus, no one was able to approach him.&#xA0;</span><span>Just one step.&#xA0;</span><span>Death was confirmed if they took one more step.&#xA0;</span><span>Everyone could feel it.</span></p><p><span>&quot;He is alone...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Yoon Bora muttered.</span></p><p><span>Everyone agreed with her words.&#xA0;</span><span>Crockta was a surreal warrior who overcame many battlefields alone.&#xA0;</span><span>It was a power that went against the knights and army of the empire. It was hard to feel when he was inactive.</span></p><p><span>Now, they could see the slaughterer of the empire as he faced the large expedition.&#xA0;</span><span>This was Crockta: the overwhelming force that crushed the enemies, the realistic horror that caused the enemies&#x2019; legs to weaken, the face of a demon.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Scary...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>It was natural to be scared of Crockta because of his fearsome orc appearance. People were enthusiastic about him because the righteous behavior didn&#x2019;t match his appearance.&#xA0;</span><span>But that wasn&#x2019;t the &#x2018;scary&#x2019; they were talking about now.</span></p><p><span>They truly felt it.&#xA0;</span><span>Everyone wanted to turn their heads away&#xA0;</span><span>The madness of a killer made them turn their eyes away.&#xA0;</span><span>This was Crockta.</span></p><p><span>-</span><i><span>Viewers...I will sense...Jungmin will jump forward now.</span></i></p><p><span>At that moment, the screen twisted.&#xA0;</span><span>At the same time, a tremendous roar was heard in the bar and from the tablet.</span></p><p><span>-</span><i><span>I am Kumarakkkkkkkk</span></i><span>&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;!</span></p><p><span>It was a catastrophe that happened elsewhere.&#xA0;</span><span>The impact shook the earth and prompted an earthquake, causing everyone on the screen to lose their balance and fall.&#xA0;</span><span>BJ Jungmin also groaned as he flopped to the ground.</span></p><p><span>-</span><i><span>Viewers, I will die...eh?</span></i></p><p><span>At the last moment, BJ Jungmin realized it.&#xA0;</span><span>The same was true for the viewers.&#xA0;</span><span>The moment he sat down from the aftermath of the earthquake.&#xA0;</span><span>BJ Jungmin entered Crockta&#x2019;s zone.</span></p><p><i><span>Chwaack.</span></i></p><p><span>At that moment, the screen turned red.&#xA0;</span><span>Everyone was at a loss.&#xA0;</span><span>Those looking at the screen all knew what it meant.&#xA0;</span><span>Soon, the blood couldn&#x2019;t overcome gravity and dripped down as the decapitated head of BJ Jungmin was shown on the screen.&#xA0;</span><span>Before long, the screen cut off.</span></p><p><span>[BJ Jungmin&#x2019;s broadcasting has ended.]</span></p><p></p><p style="text-align: center"><span>***</span></p><p></p><p><span>Crockta raised his greatsword and moved forward.&#xA0;</span><span>There was an empty spot around him. When he walked, the enemies retreated.&#xA0;</span><span>But this was a battlefield. The enemies were blocked by those behind them, leaving them no more room to retreat.</span></p><p><span>The soldiers started frantically thinking.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Only this much?&#x201D;&#xA0;</span><span>Crockta asked.</span></p><p><span>Heat spread from the tattoos on his body.</span></p><p><span>&quot;You want to get rid of us with just this much&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Crockta roared and struck with God Slayer.&#xA0;</span><span>He twisted his body to make the most of his strength. His muscles prepared for a single explosion.&#xA0;</span><span>The enemies in front of him already foretold their deaths, praying to their gods instead of fighting back.&#xA0;</span><span>Crockta gave them one last mercy and delayed his attack for a moment.</span></p><p><span>One.</span></p><p><span>Two.</span></p><p><span>The prayers were finished.&#xA0;</span><span>He swung God Slayer.&#xA0;</span><span>A gold energy spread out in a fan shape.</span></p><p><i><span>Seokeok.</span></i></p><p><span>The troops were split apart.</span></p><p><i><span>Seokeok.</span></i></p><p><span>The ones behind them were broken.</span></p><p><i><span>Seokeok.</span></i> <i><span>Seokeok.</span></i> <i><span>Seokeok.</span></i></p><p><i><span>Chwaaaak!</span></i></p><p><span>The army broke down and a fountain of blood appeared.&#xA0;</span><span>Crockta stared through the drops of liquid.&#xA0;</span><span>In a still world, Crockta walked alone on the battlefield.&#xA0;</span><span>He looked at the frightened faces praying.</span></p><p><span>It was the world of the Pinnacle.&#xA0;</span><span>Crockta stood there and saw the enemies.&#xA0;</span><span>It was time alone.&#xA0;</span><span>But at that moment.</span></p><p><span>The world shook.</span></p><p><span>&quot;......!&quot;</span></p><p><span>He looked back.&#xA0;</span><span>Their eyes met.&#xA0;</span><span>Kumarak.&#xA0;</span><span>He laughed and raised his axe.&#xA0;</span><span>In the world that stopped and converged infinitely, Crockta wasn&#x2019;t alone.&#xA0;</span><span>It wasn&#x2019;t just Kumarak.</span></p><p><i><span>Kkiiik.</span></i></p><p><span>There was a pulling noise.&#xA0;</span><span>It was Zankus.&#xA0;</span><span>Then strange laughter was heard.&#xA0;</span><span>Wallachwi.</span></p><p><span>Crockta&#x2019;s mouth rose,&#xA0;</span><span>&#x201C;I see.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>The enemies were endless and kept coming.&#xA0;</span><span>They had the power of the gods to back them up.&#xA0;</span><span>Nevertheless, Crockta wasn&#x2019;t afraid.&#xA0;</span><span>Now he wasn&#x2019;t alone.&#xA0;</span><span>It was a strange feeling.</span></p><p><span>&quot;Hey!&quot;</span></p><p><span>Suddenly, a brilliant light passed in front of him.</span></p><p><span>&quot;Stop zoning out during battle, Crockta <em>dot</em>!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Tiyo was smiling while wielding General.&#xA0;</span><span>Crockta burst out laughing.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;My mistake.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>He raised his greatsword.&#xA0;</span><span>Now was the time to fight.</span></p><p><i><span>Kkiiik.</span></i></p><p><span>The wheel of time started to turn again.&#xA0;</span><span>The greatsword moved.&#xA0;</span><span>At the same time, blood splattered all over the battlefield.</span></p><p></p><p style="text-align: center"><span>***</span></p><p></p><p><span>&#x201C;Crazy.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span><span>Adandator said. He was smiling.&#xA0;</span><span>&quot;Orcs are really crazy guys.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Why did he think they could win easily?&#xA0;</span><span>The scenes in front of him were causing doubt.&#xA0;</span><span>Every time Kumarak wielded his axe, the earth shook. Giant arrows flew from somewhere and pierced several soldiers.</span></p><p><span>&quot;These guys...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>They were monsters who didn&#x2019;t care about miracles.&#xA0;</span><span>In addition, unknown orc warriors were also exercising fearsome power.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Only this much!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>A blade stabbed the abdomen of an orc. However, the orc warrior smiled and his axe struck the enemy&#x2019;s neck.</span></p><p><i><span>Puok.</span></i></p><p><span>This time, a spear was stabbed.&#xA0;</span><span>The orc smiled and his axe descended. The master of the spear was split apart.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Only this much!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>The orc burst out laughing and randomly wielded his axe.</span></p><p><span>&quot;Only this much, humans!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Blood flowed from his eyes, nose, and mouth, but his frenzy didn&#x2019;t stop.&#xA0;</span><span>The soldiers caught by him continued to die. Every time he acted, his body became covered in wounds.&#xA0;</span><span>The orc slowly came to a stop when he became a hedgehog from all the spears and swords.&#xA0;</span><span>The orc breathed deeply before raising his axe again.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Bul&#x2019;tarrrr!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>The surrounding troops retreated with astonishment.&#xA0;</span><span>However, the orc couldn&#x2019;t swing his axe and stood still with a smiling face.&#xA0;</span><span>He fought like a warrior and died like a warrior.&#xA0;</span><span>Human limbs and guts were scattered all around him.</span></p><p><span>This...</span></p><p><span>It was an orc warrior whose name wasn&#x2019;t even known.&#xA0;</span><span>An army of these orcs was fighting.&#xA0;</span><span>The orcs&#x2019; battle cry irritated his ears.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Aklan. At this rate...&#x201D;&#xA0;</span><span>Adandator looked at him.&#xA0;</span><span>&quot;...Aklan?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Adandator paled.&#xA0;</span><span>A faint light was pouring from Aklan&#x2019;s body.</span></p><p><span>Aklan declared,&#xA0;</span><span>&quot;The real fight begins now.&quot;</span></p><p><span>It was a calm voice.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>Adandator realized.&#xA0;</span><span>They were the army of the gods.&#xA0;</span><span>This war wasn&#x2019;t just a fight between the expedition and the orcs.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;The gods are helping us.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>It was a fight between the gods and the orcs.&#xA0;</span><span>Aklan spread open his arms.&#xA0;</span><span>At the moment, the sky opened and a brilliant light shone towards the ground.&#xA0;</span><span>The gods touched the expedition. In an instant, their wounds healed and their strength recovered. A pious light that was close to madness flashed in their eyes.</span></p><p><span>It was a situation where the situation with the expedition was reversed. Now the expedition attacked the orcs.&#xA0;</span><span>They attacked their enemies with a madness that was equal to the orc warriors.</span></p><p><span>It was pandemonium.&#xA0;</span><span>A terrible sight of death and killing.</span></p><p><span>&quot;Please keep this place.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Aklan?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Aklan got down from his horse.&#xA0;</span><span>The priests and paladins of each temple followed him.</span></p><p><span>&quot;We will be victorious.&quot;</span></p><p><span>The power of the gods filled their bodies.&#xA0;</span><span>Aklan raised his sword. A light flashed.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;In the name of the gods.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>The flags were raised.&#xA0;</span><span>At this moment, the gods borrowed their bodies and participated.</span></p><p><span>It was the serious opening of the war.</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p><p><a href="www.wuxiaworld.com">Glossary of Common Korean Terms.</a></p><p>Praise the Orc:&#xA0;<a href="docs.google.com">Glossary Link.&#xA0;</a></p><p>Current schedule:&#xA0;There will now be 14 chapters a week, meaning two chapters every day.</p><p>I have also updated my&#xA0;<a href="www.patreon.com">Patreon</a>&#xA0;to reflect my new novels.
