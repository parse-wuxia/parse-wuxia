<p><span>Chapter 34 - Contrast (1)</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p><p><span>Crockta wasn&#x2019;t impressed as he finally entered the elven city of Arnin.</span></p><p><span>Of course, everything was well organized. The scale of the buildings was enormous, and the beautiful elves smelling the leaves of the trees looked like the gods from Greek mythology.&#xA0;</span><span>But it wasn&#x2019;t any more grandiose than Orcrox Fortress. Apart from the elves&#x2019; buildings being whiter with their aesthetic tastes, the level of construction in the city was similar to that in Orcrox.</span></p><p><span>So he wasn&#x2019;t impressed like the elf guiding him expected.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;It has been a long time since I&#x2019;ve seen an orc. How about it, isn&#x2019;t our city beautiful compared to what you are used to?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Crockta nodded slightly.</span></p><p><span>&quot;Look, this building is in the latest Bellitran style. It is an architectural style developed by the elf architect, Bellitran. It was a revolution. There was an uproar in the capital. To emphasize the depths...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Where is Ilya?</span></p><p><span>Crockta interrupted.&#xA0;</span><span>The elf pouted with dissatisfaction.</span></p><p><span>&quot;Don&#x2019;t be in a hurry. Once you learn more about Arnin...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;I didn&#x2019;t come here to play.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Crockta looked around.&#xA0;</span><span>There were only two species in Arnin, humans and elves. They were mostly elves, and occasionally humans could be seen.&#xA0;</span><span>But most users were humans.&#xA0;</span><span>In his eyes, they all seemed suspicious, like they were members of the Thawing Balhae Clan.</span></p><p><span>&quot;Oh, you are urgent. Too urgent. I know why you came here, but you shouldn&#x2019;t live like that.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;......&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Okay. Follow me.&quot;</span></p><p><span>The elf raised a hand to Crockta&#x2019;s shoulder.&#xA0;</span><span>He turned away from the residential area of Arnin where they were walking into an alley between two buildings. The elf increased his pace.&#xA0;</span><span>Arnin was filled with greenery, so it wasn&#x2019;t hard to keep up with his movements. He jumped between trees like a monkey and led Crockta to a hidden place in the city.</span></p><p><span>Soon, an entire forest was revealed. There was a lush forest inside the city.&#xA0;</span><span>As the elf ran through the forest, his form temporarily couldn&#x2019;t be seen. Crockta sped up as he headed in the direction that the elf had disappeared.</span></p><p><span>It was a while before Crockta caught up with him again. The elf was sitting at a round wooden table in the middle of the forest.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;This place?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;I have fond childhood memories here. It is also a safe place.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>The elf grinned.</span></p><p><span>&quot;I am Ilya.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;I guessed so.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Is that so? Huhu. I was surprised when Derek suddenly said he would help me... It is even more surprising that the person sent is an orc.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>He waved his hand. The magic power swayed and a few leaves fell into his hands.&#xA0;</span><span>He arranged them on top of the table.&#xA0;</span><span>&quot;Our objective is the same, so let&#x2019;s join hands.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Please explain in detail.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;You want to get rid of the group of cursed people called Thawing Balhae. I want to get rid of the corrupt people who colluded with Thawing Balhae and establish a clean order in Arnin.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Corrupt?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Who is the corrupt person?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Ilya placed three leaves on the round table and picked up one of them. It had a hole in it from where a worm had bitten through. Ilya raised it to his eyes.&#xA0;</span><span>His blue eyes were visible through the hole.</span></p><p><span>&quot;Arnin&#x2019;s mayor, Elsanad.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Crockta nodded. He recalled Derek&#x2019;s voice.</span></p><p><span>&#x2018;I have planned a few investments on the premise that you are successful in your revenge.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span>Derek was betting on the collapse of the Arnin mayor.&#xA0;</span><span>Crockta looked into Ilya&#x2019;s eyes.&#xA0;</span><span>Derek was absolutely not a good person. It was hard to believe in Ilya if he had a good relationship with Derek.</span></p><p><span>Ilya shrugged.</span></p><p><span>&quot;All you have to do is hit the Thawing Balhae Clan with me. I will take care of the rest, so don&#x2019;t worry.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;...Um.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>But Crockta wasn&#x2019;t a good person either. His goal was a bloody revenge.&#xA0;</span><span>Therefore, he would join hands with Ilya for the collapse of a common enemy.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;I understand.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;It sounds like you have decided to do it together with me, so let me explain in more detail.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Ilya placed a hand on the round table. Suddenly, the wind blew away the leaves.</span></p><p><span>&quot;In the past, Mayor Elsanad and I were friends. She was a dear friend of mine.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>His eyes became distant as he recalled the past.</span></p><p><span>&quot;We once wanted to make Arnin a happy place for everyone. We were young. I helped her to become the mayor. However, she gradually changed. After getting the taste of power, she changed. Now she isn&#x2019;t the Elsanad that I knew anymore.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Is this related to the Thawing Balhae Clan?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Of course. She is conspiring with those cursed by the stars called Thawing Balhae...they started elf trafficking and the reconstruction of the city.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;......&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;The people you want to kill are the dogs of Mayor Elsanad, the ones enjoying profit from her. Here, let me show you.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Ilya beckoned to the air.&#xA0;</span><span>Then two elves walked out from among the bushes. Crockta wasn&#x2019;t surprised since he had noticed them. Ilya introduced them,&#xA0;</span><span>&quot;They are my friends.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;It is nice to meet you.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Nice to meet you.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>They greeted Crockta. They felt something unusual in the orc&#x2019;s eyes. Crockta greeted them.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Are you alive? I am the orc Crockta.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Ilya explained Crockta&#x2019;s words.&#xA0;</span><span>&quot;This is an orc greeting.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>The two elves moved.&#xA0;</span><span>The group left the forest where the round table was located, heading in the opposite direction from the way Crockta entered.</span></p><p><span>Crockta frowned as he saw the landscape outside of the forest.&#xA0;</span><span>It was far from the glamorous Arnin that he saw earlier. There were crumbling buildings and houses that were just barely keeping their shape. These were the streets of the poor.&#xA0;</span><span>It was like looking at the back alleys of Anail.</span></p><p><span>&quot;I showed you Arnin&#x2019;s sunny spot earlier, while this is Arnin&#x2019;s shade. Nobody cares about this place.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Suddenly, there was a disturbance.&#xA0;</span><span>Ilya placed his finger to his lips in a &#x2018;shh&#x2019; gesture.&#xA0;</span><span>They approached the place through some shade.</span></p><p><span>&quot;......!&quot;</span></p><p><span>Crockta&#x2019;s eyes widened.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>A group of humans were kidnapping an elf in front of an old house.&#xA0;</span><span>The elf&#x2019;s mouth was covered with a towel and her body restrained so that she couldn&#x2019;t move. The captured elf was twisting her body to resist, but she couldn&#x2019;t go against the strength of many.&#xA0;</span><span>A kidnapping was taking place in broad daylight.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Damn!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Crockta tried to run out.&#xA0;</span><span>However, Ilya grabbed Crockta. His body was greatly shaking. Ilya looked startled as he saw Crockta&#x2019;s arm trembling.</span></p><p><span>&quot;Calm down.&quot;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Look at that...!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;I know where they are going.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;......!&quot;</span></p><p><span>&quot;They are the small fries. Taking care of them will just make their leaders more vigilant. We must wipe them all out.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>The kidnappers disappeared with the elf. Crockta took deep breaths to try and calm his anger.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;You have a strong sense of justice. I&#x2019;m really surprised.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;......&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Ilya said, &#x201C;Hang in there. I also want to save her right now. But numerous other women, children, and men have disappeared this way. We have to save them as well.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Doesn&#x2019;t Arnin have security forces or guards?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;They do, but they don&#x2019;t come here. It is an abandoned area.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;......&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;One or two people will disappear and the empty houses will become a rich elven villa.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>He pointed to a distant place.&#xA0;</span><span>New buildings were going up in that area. Elves and humans alike were sweating as they built a mansion.&#xA0;</span><span>It was strange comparing the large building to the old and ruined houses.</span></p><p><span>Crockta asked,</span></p><p><span>&quot;What about the kidnapped people?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;There are only a few options. Sold into slavery, selling their bodies, or worse.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Ilya placed an arm over Crockta&#x2019;s shoulder.</span></p><p><span>&quot;I also feel the emotions that you are currently feeling.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>They looked around the slums for a while before entering the center of Arnin through the forest.&#xA0;</span><span>It was a stunning city compared to the streets that he had just seen. Elves were smiling as they walked the streets, looking like they were from photographs of famous brands.</span></p><p><span>But it no longer looked beautiful to Crockta.</span></p><p><span>&quot;I&#x2019;ll introduce you to the inn where you will be staying for the time being.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;When will the plan begin?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Tomorrow, or maybe as early as tonight.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Crockta nodded.</span></p><p><span>&quot;I know that orc warriors are tough, but there are many enemies. Be well prepared.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Ilya guided Crockta to his accommodations.&#xA0;</span><span>It was a small inn located on the corner of the main street. The owner was an old friend of Ilya&#x2019;s. He was surprised to see an orc but nodded at Ilya&#x2019;s description. Then he welcomed Crockta.</span></p><p><span>&quot;It is the first time I will have an orc guest, hahahat! You are really big and strong. Elves aren&#x2019;t like this. Kuhuhuhut!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Despite being an elf, the owner had rugged muscles.&#xA0;</span><span>There were a few muscular people among the elves.</span></p><p><span>&quot;Yes, aren&#x2019;t you a little bit heavy? What is your weight? Is it three times mine? Hahat!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;......&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Next time, you should exercise with me. Hahat!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Ilya paid for the inn.</span></p><p><span>Crockta put down his luggage, left the inn, and looked around Arnin.&#xA0;</span><span>The rare appearance of an orc drew the attention of the elves. Crockta ignored their gazes and reached the fountain in the center of the main street.</span></p><p><span>&quot;Can I ask you one thing?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>He talked to a young man sitting idly at the fountain.&#xA0;</span><span>He was a human and he seemed to be thinking as he stared into the air.&#xA0;</span><span>Then he looked startled as Crockta appeared.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Wow, an orc! How surprising. What did you want to know?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;What is Mayor Elsanad like?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Elsanad? She is an excellent mayor. She has made Arnin prosperous.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Is that so?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;I hope she will be elected again. There is an upcoming election. I will vote as a citizen of Arnin.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Crockta nodded.</span></p><p><span>&quot;So she has no problems?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Problem... I heard that she&#x2019;s worried that her daughter isn&#x2019;t listening to her. Why? Do you want citizenship here?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Something similar.&quot;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Haha, Arnin is a livable city. Welcome.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;I will think about it. By the way, what were you thinking about so intently just now?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Ah...in fact...&#x201D;&#xA0;</span><span>The young man struggled to open his mouth.&#xA0;</span><span>&quot;The person I love...how to... I want to confess...what do you think about expressing my heart publicly? Would you be impressed?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;......&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;I&#x2019;m going to do a surprise event after calling her. I&#x2019;ll make a heart with candles and serenade her, singing publicly in front of many people....&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Crockta shook his head.&#xA0;</span><span>&quot;Get rid of that.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;...Huh?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Listen to my words.&quot;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;T-Then...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Rather than a spectacular event, your sincerity will work better.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;...Ah...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;It is better to confess your heart when the both of you are alone.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Like this, he saved the life of the young man.&#xA0;</span><span>Crockta finished the conversation and got up from his spot.</span></p><p><span>Something had been irritating him from the beginning.&#xA0;</span><span>Crockta turned his head. There was an elf looking at him from the middle of a crowd. He smiled as he noticed Crockta&#x2019;s gaze. Crockta approached him.</span></p><p><span>It was Ilya.</span></p><p><span>&quot;Are you following me?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Yes, something like that. Please understand. Derek sent you, but I can&#x2019;t trust you straight away.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>He cleared his throat and placed an arm around Crockta&#x2019;s shoulder. Then he lowered his voice.&#xA0;</span><span>&#x201C;I heard your conversation with that young man.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;......&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Just like that young man, Arnin&#x2019;s citizens are being deceived. Everybody thinks she is a good person. The truth is...what we saw. The awful truth.&quot;</span></p><p><span>Crockta and Ilya moved with their shoulders close to each other. As Crockta walked a little bit, he saw Ilya&#x2019;s colleagues.&#xA0;</span><span>They whispered something to Ilya.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;The date is decided. Tonight, we will move.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;......&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;I will stop by the inn at midnight. I&#x2019;ll see you then. Please be prepared.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Crockta nodded.&#xA0;</span><span>Ilya licked his lips before saying something else.&#xA0;</span><span>&#x201C;Right now, your anger at their misdeeds is vivid. I have been waiting for someone with a strong sense of justice like you to come.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>He grinned.&#xA0;</span><span>&quot;Arnin needs people like you. Welcome. Then...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>He disappeared into the crowd with his group.</span></p><p><span>Crockta considered his words.&#xA0;</span><span>A sense of justice.&#xA0;</span><span>It didn&#x2019;t fit at all. He was angry at the scene, but that didn&#x2019;t mean that it was due to a sense of justice. Crockta looked in the direction that Ilya had disappeared in for a while. His eyes blazed.</span></p><p><span>He just had common sense.</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p><p><a href="www.wuxiaworld.com">Glossary of Common Korean Terms.</a></p><p>Praise the Orc:&#xA0;<a href="docs.google.com">Glossary Link.&#xA0;</a></p><p>Current schedule: &#xA0;<strong>Another Patreon goal has been reached!!
