<p><span>Chapter 172 - Encirclement Battle (3)</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p><p><span>Andre and his white horse ran down the hill.</span></p><p><span>Rommel gave a direct command.&#xA0;</span><span>The soldiers supporting the knights&#x2019; encirclement split to the right and left.&#xA0;</span><span>They split apart to open the way for him. Then the next layer was divided. The layered encirclement divided like Moses&#x2019; miracle.</span></p><p><span>Andre&#x2019;s unstoppable charge streaked past the soldiers.&#xA0;</span><span>Now the final encirclement formed by the knights was at hand. Andre&#x2019;s horse gradually accelerated until it was like a meteor.&#xA0;</span><span>The knights opened the way.</span></p><p><span>Now there was only a single circle left.&#xA0;</span><span>Beyond it was Crockta.&#xA0;</span><span>There were no brakes on a charging horse. He only headed forward and the knights moved out of his way.&#xA0;</span><span>He bent his body further.&#xA0;</span><span>As the horseshoes hit the ground, he entered the world beyond. The world compressed and the space was thrust aside. He penetrated straight towards his goal.</span></p><p><span>The lance was already aiming straight at the enemy&#x2019;s heart.&#xA0;</span><span>Crockta&#x2019;s body appeared in front of him.&#xA0;</span><span>Andre grinned.&#xA0;</span><span>His mouth curved as he anticipated the collision that would soon occur.&#xA0;</span><span>Adrenaline reached its peak and his arms tingled as they welcomed the collision. &#xA0;His body was pushing towards a thrilling impact.</span></p><p><span>Crockta&#x2019;s body became a blur.&#xA0;</span><span>But Andre didn&#x2019;t stop.</span></p><p><i><span>Kwaang!</span></i></p><p><span>One.</span></p><p><i><span>Kwa kwang!</span></i></p><p><span>Two.</span></p><p><em><span>Kwa kwa kwa kwang!</span></em></p><p><span>He struck more than three people.&#xA0;</span><span>The bodies of the knights caught in his first clash flew to the side.&#xA0;</span><span>His charge continued without any brakes. He crushed the knights and infantry.&#xA0;</span><span>The knights&#x2019; and soldiers&#x2019; ranks were broken.&#xA0;</span><span>Andre explosively pushed through towards the rear of the army.</span></p><p><span>The shattering assault of one person!&#xA0;</span><span>The imperial army was breached.&#xA0;</span><span>There were only dead bodies left in his wake.&#xA0;</span><span>The encirclement around Crockta was cut off.</span></p><p><span>Andre&#x2019;s final target was Rommel, who was commanding the army in the rear.&#xA0;</span><span>Andre&#x2019;s white horse accelerated. Their faces were confused. Andre tightened his grip on his lance.</span></p><p><i><span>Kwaaaang!</span></i></p><p><span>One person turned into white particles.&#xA0;</span><span>It wasn&#x2019;t Rommel. His charge missed.&#xA0;</span><span>Keynes and the Heaven and Earth members beside Rommel used magic and their bodies to protect him.&#xA0;</span><span>Andre looked around. Rommel and his entourage escaped into the army.</span></p><p><span>He gradually slowed down.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Too bad.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>It wasn&#x2019;t enough to kill Rommel.&#xA0;</span><span>He turned his horse around and looked at his work.&#xA0;</span><span>The imperial army was still struggling to recover. Smoke seemed to drift up from the ground in the wake of his charge.</span></p><p><span>Andre raised his lance and celebrated, &quot;Kuahahat.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>He met Crockta&#x2019;s eyes.</span></p><p><span>&quot;Brat, your face is surprised,&#x201D; muttered Andre as he lowered his lance.</span></p><p><span>He was already aware that Crockta was his disciple, Jung Ian.&#xA0;</span><span>It had been a long time since the character, &#x2018;Crockta&#x2019;, started to be famous. It was in the first duel video against the user hunters that Baek Hanho was able to find Ian&#x2019;s old habit in Crockta.</span></p><p><span>The index finger.</span></p><p><span>Ian didn&#x2019;t even know it himself.&#xA0;</span><span>After returning to South Korea, Ian would always twitch his index finger whenever he entered the confrontation phase of a spar. Maybe he saw the image of a trigger. Either way, it was a habit gained from the battlefield.</span></p><p><span>Crockta moved his index finger slightly in the video, twitching it whenever he wielded his greatsword.&#xA0;</span><span>His body was bigger, and his face was heinous, but his stance and moves were distinctive and the same.</span></p><p><span>How could he not know?&#xA0;</span><span>Baek Hanho had taught his student ever since Ian was a child, after all.&#xA0;</span><span>He knew all of Ian&#x2019;s moves.&#xA0;</span><span>Baek Hanho was convinced that Crockta was Ian after seeing the orc&#x2019;s attitude.&#xA0;</span><span>The testimony from Ian&#x2019;s little sister, Yiyu, which stated that he was playing Elder Lord, added to this.</span></p><p><span>Therefore, he pretended not to know and tried to cause a dispute with his disciple in the game; however, the situation became like this.&#xA0;</span><span>Unfortunately, he missed.&#xA0;</span><span>The scale of this battle was suitable for Baek Hanho&#x2019;s disciple.</span></p><p><span>&quot;Now, let&#x2019;s go back.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>The white horse started running again.&#xA0;</span><span>This horse wasn&#x2019;t just a horse. This white horse was Andre&#x2019;s greatest treasure.&#xA0;</span><span>It didn&#x2019;t matter even if the legendary red hare appeared at the end of a quest. This was a horse with dragon&#x2019;s blood.</span></p><p><span>&quot;Let&apos;s go, back.&quot;</span></p><p><span>Andre started to circle the imperial army&#x2019;s formation, trying to cut them from the sides.&#xA0;</span><span>The soldiers were terrified. They had already experienced this with Crockta, so fear took over.</span></p><p><span>Inside was Crockta.&#xA0;</span><span>Outside was Andre.</span></p><p><span>The empire&#x2019;s army fell into confusion at the hands of only two enemies.&#xA0;</span><span>Andre got into the proper position and started to charge again. Crockta also raised his greatsword.</span></p><p><span>The hammer flew towards the anvil.</span></p><p></p><p style="text-align: center"><span>***</span></p><p></p><p><span>Crockta laughed.</span></p><p><span>He had been conscious that White Knight Andre was Baek Hanho, but his teacher already knew that Crockta was Ian.&#xA0;</span><span>The mentor and disciple met in the game during a one-sided battle, but the world wouldn&#x2019;t know this.</span></p><p><span>Crockta raised his greatsword.&#xA0;</span><span>The imperial forces were recovering from what Andre had done. Still, there were too many enemies. However, the burden had divided by half.&#xA0;</span><span>This was enough.</span></p><p><span>Andre started charging again. Crockta wielded the greatsword in response to Andre.&#xA0;</span><span>The new blood transformed the stagnant battlefield. The imperial troops were dying. Blood fell to the ground.&#xA0;</span><span>The knights were pushed back by Crockta&#x2019;s fierce attacks. However, Rommel was skilled.</span></p><p><span>He had lost his composure from Andre&#x2019;s sudden attack, but he immediately resumed command and tightened the circle of knights.&#xA0;</span><span>Then he created formations on the outside to keep Andre in check.&#xA0;</span><span>It was solid on the inside and outside.</span></p><p><span>Andre couldn&#x2019;t repeat his exciting dash across the entire army like he did before.&#xA0;</span><span>The soldiers were easy but he needed to be careful of the knights on horses.</span></p><p><span>A struggle of life and death followed.</span></p><p><span>Crockta had to deal with Adandator, Betring, and Bluno at the same time.&#xA0;</span><span>The three of them stabbed at Crockta&#x2019;s gaps. Crockta moved back and forth between the Pinnacle and Hero realms to deal with the enemies.</span></p><p><span>He was expanding his limits by the extreme crossing back and forth of realms.&#xA0;</span><span>He used the Pinnacle in a necessary moment to defeat the enemies. Then he manipulated causality to reverse a dangerous moment.&#xA0;</span><span>The enemies continued to suffer damage because they couldn&#x2019;t resist Crockta&#x2019;s greatsword.</span></p><p><span>Adandator gritted his teeth.&#xA0;</span><span>The wounds Crockta dealt caused blood to flow from his mouth. He spat out some of the teeth that hadn&#x2019;t fallen yet.&#xA0;</span><span>A strong fighting desire filled him.</span></p><p><span>&quot;I will deal with Crockta. Stop the other one.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>His pronunciation was ruined but the knights nodded calmly.&#xA0;</span><span>Adandator immediately reached the Hero realm. He pulled out all his strength. The tentacles that violated the laws of the world stretched out from him. That energy shot towards Crockta.</span></p><p><span>Crockta sensed it and his face hardened. Adandator&#x2019;s power burst forward.&#xA0;</span><span>Crockta smiled while grasping his greatsword.</span></p><p><span>&quot;Do you like soup? Won&#x2019;t you have to eat it for the rest of your life?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;You scum!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Adandator plunged forward. Crockta also entered the Hero realm. Both swords hit each other. At the same time, the strands of causality wove together.&#xA0;</span><span>Offense and offense, both sides were offset. It was a chaotic fight where it was difficult to tell where things were reversed.</span></p><p><span>Crockta didn&#x2019;t lose his concentration and persistently pursued Adandator with his greatsword.&#xA0;</span><span>Adandator&#x2019;s leg was hit. He lost his balance and fell. However, the other knights immediately attacked Crockta from behind.</span></p><p><span>Crockta ignored them and his greatsword descended.&#xA0;</span><span>Adandator tried to avoid it but his greatsword was quick.&#xA0;</span><span>Crockta&#x2019;s shoulders and thighs would be hit, while he would pierce Adandator&#x2019;s heart.</span></p><p><span>&quot;......!&quot;</span></p><p><span>However, causality reversed. Their powers tweaked their attacks.&#xA0;</span><span>Instead of his shoulders and thighs, his back was cut. Ogre Slayer stabbed Adandator&#x2019;s shoulder instead of his heart.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Ugh.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Aaack!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Adandator struggled.&#xA0;</span><span>Crockta received some damage, but the wound he inflicted meant that Adandator was out of the battle.&#xA0;</span><span>He was satisfied at this and stepped back. The knights picked up Adandator. Crockta turned and looked for Betring and Bluno.</span></p><p><span>They couldn&#x2019;t be seen.&#xA0;</span><span>He hurriedly turned his head. They were heading away from Crockta towards Andre.&#xA0;</span><span>Andre&apos;s assault was fearsome but it would be tough if he went against both of them.&#xA0;</span><span>The repeated assaults meant the he and his horse were injured all over. Now he was tired. It was hard to maintain the same explosive assault.&#xA0;</span><span>In the near future, Andre would be caught up in the imperial army and the situation would worsen again.</span></p><p><span>Crockta raised his greatsword and tried to break through the knights. However, the encirclement was solid.&#xA0;</span><span>Using the power of transcendence, four or five knights were beheaded in unison. Their heads flew through the air.</span></p><p><span>Despite the fearsome sight, the knights remained calm.</span></p><p><span>Crockta looked up and saw Rommel watching the battlefield from far away.&#xA0;</span><span>This was the amazing ability of the War Maestro class. His strength bound this army together. Thanks to Rommel&#x2019;s power, the knights forgot their fear and countered Crockta.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Kulkulkul.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>He knew.&#xA0;</span><span>It was impossible to deal with these troops alone.&#xA0;</span><span>But it didn&#x2019;t matter.&#xA0;</span><span>He held his greatsword. The enemies stepped back.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>Crockta grinned.&#xA0;</span><span>&#x201C;Did you hear what I said?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>He remembered the face of the gray god, who was watching him.&#xA0;</span><span>His assimilation rate was now 100%, so dying in Elder Lord would be the same as dying on Earth. Despite the grim, desperate situation, Crockta still felt joy.</span></p><p><span>He was just doing what he had to, with the world pushing at his back.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Come.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>The knights rushed in an organized manner. Crockta broke them down one by one. Death and death mixed together. Crockta yelled towards his enemies.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Bul&#x2019;tarrrrrrrrrr&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>He was a warrior and survival wasn&#x2019;t enough.&#xA0;</span><span>He recalled the ceremony on the day he received the name Crockta.</span></p><p><span>Honor.&#xA0;</span><span>As a glorious warrior, he would use the blade of honor against death.</span></p><p><span>&quot;Come&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>The enemies burst forward.&#xA0;</span><span>Crockta&#x2019;s body was wounded. The blades of the enemies were stabbed in his thighs and back. He cut their necks in return.&#xA0;</span><span>He pulled the weapons out of his body. Blood poured from the split skin.</span></p><p><span>He didn&#x2019;t care.&#xA0;</span><span>He could see Andre surrounded by knights. The horse had already disappeared. It was dead or gone. He was struggling against Betring and Bluno.</span></p><p><span>Andre met Crockta&#x2019;s eyes.</span></p><p><span>&#x2018;Hey, Kid.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span>He remembered the first time he met Baek Hanho.</span></p><p><span>&apos;Are you fighting?&#x2019;</span></p><p><span>At the time, Baek Hanho was young. He asked Ian point-blank, while Ian thought he was a neighborhood gangster.</span></p><p><span>It was a memory now.&#xA0;</span><span>However, there was no point thinking about old enemies.</span></p><p><span>He was Crockta.&#xA0;</span><span>An orc and warrior.</span></p><p><span>&quot;Andre&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Crockta called his name loudly.&#xA0;</span><span>Andre looked at him. He was on the brink of being pushed back by Betring.</span></p><p><span>Crockta yelled with a smile.</span></p><p><span>&quot;Ugly&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Andre&#x2019;s eyes widened at the words then he started laughing. He found some strength and counterattacked.&#xA0;</span><span>Their swords met. Betring retreated.</span></p><p><span>&quot;You&#x2019;re good&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Andre responded by kicking Betring.</span></p><p><span>Crockta started laughing.&#xA0;</span><span>He killed and killed, as more enemies kept coming.&#xA0;</span><span>He pushed forward but the situation didn&#x2019;t change much.&#xA0;</span><span>There seemed to be no end.&#xA0;</span><span>His greatsword dragged on the ground as he moved forward.</span></p><p><span>Now was the time to think. He was in the midst of reminiscing about his sister, the balance of his account and Cafe Reason when...</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;......?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>A strange sound was heard from far away.&#xA0;</span><span>Crockta and the troops looked around and saw a man. It didn&#x2019;t matter if that was his true movement speed or if he used a speed enhancement spell&#x2014;he was still taking to the air like a madman.</span></p><p><span>Crockta gulped as he saw the man.</span></p><p><span>The man&#x2019;s voice gradually grew closer.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Aigoo! I beg your pardon! I was proud of my body in the old days, although you probably can&#x2019;t guess or imagine it! Kukakakat! When you go to hell, will you let the beautiful demon take hold of you...? Huhuhu, isn&#x2019;t this a basic masterpiece for a hero? No! You really are! What a series of surprises. Listen to my shoulders shaking! Shake shake! How long are you going to make my shoulders dance? Kukakakakakak!&#x201D;</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p><p><a href="www.wuxiaworld.com">Glossary of Common Korean Terms.</a></p><p>Praise the Orc:&#xA0;<a href="docs.google.com">Glossary Link.&#xA0;</a></p><p>Current schedule:&#xA0;There will now be 14 chapters a week, meaning two chapters every day.</p><p>I have also updated my&#xA0;<a href="www.patreon.com">Patreon</a>&#xA0;to reflect my new novels.
