<p><span>Chapter 221 - A Road has No Gate (4)</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p><p><span>There had been war since ancient times.&#xA0;</span><span>It all began when the stars died.</span></p><p><span>As the star god returned to the void, the grey god watched over all deaths as she received the heritage of the star god.&#xA0;&#xA0;</span><span>As a result, the grey god witnessed the end of the universe.&#xA0;&#xA0;</span><span>The lights in the universe were turned off and the world sank into darkness, returning to a space with no time.</span></p><p><span>That was their last appearance.&#xA0;</span><span>They were the last civilization left in this lonely universe.&#xA0;</span><span>Even the last sun was going to die out.</span></p><p><span>The grey god fell into despair.&#xA0;</span><span>There was a chance. Through the legacy of the star god, she realized that there was a great magic that could reverse the fate of the universe and return it to the beginning.&#xA0;</span><span>But there wasn&#x2019;t much time left and the sun continued to fall.</span></p><p><span>She tried to reverse the fate of the world, before the sun&#x2019;s power was exhausted.&#xA0;</span><span>The gods resisted.&#xA0;</span><span>Thus, the grey god and the species of death collided against the gods of Olympus.&#xA0;</span><span>It was a fierce fight.</span></p><p><span>And he was there: Gushantimur, the most powerful dragon.&#xA0;</span><span>Following their own beliefs, the dragons stood on both sides of the argument, with Gushantimur being one that followed the grey god.</span></p><p><span>He was the last dragon who bit the gods by her side, until the grey god was defeated and thrown into another dimension.&#xA0;</span><span>Due to his mighty power, he could keep himself fully awake, even though the other dragons were killed or in hibernation.</span></p><p><span>After the grey god was thrown into another dimension, Gushantimur was left alone to contemplate the world.&#xA0;</span><span>He became a hermit of the Black Forest.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;She is back.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Gushantimur set up a castle and reached out to those who needed help.&#xA0;</span><span>They were mainstream people of the world, such as humans, elves, and dwarves, as well as those treated like monsters: the goblins, ogres, trolls, etc.&#xA0;</span><span>Gushantimur shared the feelings of the weak and the small.</span></p><p><span>It was just a moment in comparison to the time he had lived.&#xA0;</span><span>However.&#xA0;</span><span>These short moments were never in vain.&#xA0;</span><span>They were raw but strong students.&#xA0;</span><span>Their minutes and seconds shone so brightly compared to those who lived for a long time.</span></p><p><span>&quot;Do I really want to see the end...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>The grey god aimed to save the universe from its fate and reconnect the cycle of life.&#xA0;</span><span>He looked at the sun and sighed.&#xA0;</span><span>Now he didn&#x2019;t know what was heavier or more important.</span></p><p><span>Gushantimur closed his eyes.&#xA0;</span><span>The wind blew through his hair. His disciples felt the aura of the grey god and looked towards the north.&#xA0;</span><span>His always loud lair was locked in silence.</span></p><p><span>There was a sad smile on his face as he remembered the grey god.</span></p><p><span>&#x2018;The world will be saved from destruction.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span>No one could see the world like the grey god.&#xA0;</span><span>Therefore, no one could truly understand her despair.</span></p><p><span>&#x2018;I won&#x2019;t let the universe cool down forever.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span>The universe was nearing its end and all she saw was death.&#xA0;</span><span>She saw the darkness in the morning sun and felt hopeless over the eternal void. It was a terrible sinking worse than death.</span></p><p><span>A north wind blew.&#xA0;</span><span>Gushantimur kept his eyes closed.&#xA0;</span><span>He couldn&#x2019;t figure out what to do.</span></p><p><span>Suddenly, he remembered a warrior.&#xA0;</span><span>The warrior was someone who caused miracles everywhere they went.&#xA0;</span><span>A warrior who accomplished things that seemed impossible. He cut the neck of the great chieftain who was possessed by the Tribulation, faced the great empire alone and defeated a god.&#xA0;</span><span>Now he was going against the grey god to save the world.&#xA0;</span><span>One of the greatest fighters of this era.</span></p><p><span>Crockta.&#xA0;</span><span>While their time together was short, he was someone who couldn&#x2019;t be forgotten.&#xA0;</span><span>A tough face that always smiled mischievously. The one who wielded a huge greatsword. Someone who rushed recklessly and didn&#x2019;t know how to retreat.</span></p><p><span>What was the reason for fighting like that?&#xA0;</span><span>How could he do so?</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;I...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Someone called out to him, &#x201C;Master!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>He looked back to see a weak guy that just entered, an innocent kobold.&#xA0;</span><span>He was the kobold shooter Komojak, and his idol was the goblin Kiao.&#xA0;</span><span>He entered the Black Forest and begged to be his disciple.</span></p><p><span>&quot;I will shoot a bow today!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>A straw doll was shaking in front of him. His accuracy wasn&#x2019;t that great but there was pleasure on the kobold&#x2019;s face.</span></p><p><span>&quot;I will shoot this twice tomorrow keong keong! Please train me tomorrow keong!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>He said with a bright smile.</span></p><p><span>Tomorrow.</span></p><p><span>Gushantimur looked at him blankly.&#xA0;&#xA0;</span><span>The kobold didn&#x2019;t know anything. Even though the countdown to the end of the world was going on, he was laughing and talking about tomorrow.&#xA0;</span><span>Gushantimur looked around.&#xA0;</span><span>Numerous disciples were looking at him. Unknown emotions were in their eyes.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Tomorrow.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>If tomorrow came like the kobold said.&#xA0;</span><span>It wouldn&#x2019;t stop tomorrow, there would be many more tomorrows.&#xA0;</span><span>Gushantimur and all his disciples would enjoy tomorrow and the rest of their lives.&#xA0;&#xA0;</span><span>The sun would go down and rise again. Thus, they would live another day.&#xA0;</span><span>Every day, every minute.</span></p><p><span>That&#x2019;s right.&#xA0;</span><span>He already knew.</span></p><p><span>Gushantimur spoke in a soft voice,&#xA0;</span><span>&quot;Two times isn&#x2019;t enough.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Keong?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;You will have to shoot it three times, not two. Can you do it?&quot;</span></p><p><span>The kobold looked awkward.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&quot;T-Three keong...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>He scratched his head and avoided Gushantimur&#x2019;s eyes.&#xA0;</span><span>He looked at the straw dolls and the wounds on his hands, before nodding at Gushantimur.</span></p><p><span>&quot;T-Three times is too much keong...but, let&#x2019;s try it keong...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Yes.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Gushantimur turned to the other disciples.&#xA0;</span><span>Everyone was staring at him.&#xA0;</span><span>He spoke again,&#xA0;</span><span>&quot;Tomorrow, I want to see how everyone has improved. It will be a harsh day. Is everyone prepared?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Their eyes widened. The disciples looked at each other and nodded.</span></p><p><span>Gushantimur smiled. </span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Yes.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>His body floated in the air.&#xA0;</span><span>Gushantimur&#x2019;s body, which was in the form of a young man, started to slowly change.&#xA0;</span><span>Black scales sprouted on his body. His body extended. Wings spread out from his back and the irises of a beast appeared in his eyes.</span></p><p><span>Now he was as big as the castle.&#xA0;</span><span>His body was huge enough to cast shade on his entire body.&#xA0;</span><span>Beautiful scales and broad wings.&#xA0;</span><span>The mightiest species, a dragon.&#xA0;</span><span>His true appearance was revealed.&#xA0;</span><span>The kobold stared at him with wide eyes and a gaping mouth. Even his original disciples had never seen Gushantimur like this.</span></p><p><span>After returning to the form of a black dragon, Gushantimur whispered.&#xA0;</span><span>His voice was as soft as always.</span></p><p><span>&apos;Rest early today and prepare for tomorrow.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span>One disciple asked aloud,&#xA0;</span><span>&#x201C;Master, where are you going?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x2018;I...&#x2019;&#xA0;</span><span>Gushantimur used his wings to turn his body.&#xA0;</span><span>&#x2018;I am also preparing for tomorrow.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span>He flew towards the Temple of the Fallen God.</span></p><p></p><p style="text-align: center"><span>***</span></p><p></p><p><i><span>Kurwarwarwarwa!</span></i></p><p><span>The black dragon&#x2019;s breath poured towards the giant cannon. Crockta and Abaddon rolled to avoid the aftermath.</span></p><p><i><span>Kurwarwarwarwa!</span></i></p><p><span>The world was filled with a ringing sound.&#xA0;</span><span>The breath melted everything.&#xA0;</span><span>The breath swallowed everything, leaving behind a huge hole.&#xA0;</span><span>It was like lava flowed over the ground. In the place where the ancient weapon was, only a smoking hole remained.</span></p><p><span>Crockta stared blankly at the sky.&#xA0;</span><span>It was the first time he saw a black dragon.&#xA0;</span><span>However, he knew the identity of the dragon.</span></p><p><span>&quot;Gushantimur&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>He appeared to neutralize the enemy&#x2019;s weapon. Crockta smiled. It was an unexpected salvation.</span></p><p><span>He asked, &quot;Did you have a connection with Gushantimur?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Abaddon spoke in a dismal voice,&#xA0;</span><span>&quot;As far as I know, he...he was a great friend who fought with us in the past. Why is he stopping us now?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Kulkul, the Gushantimur that I know is different.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>He didn&#x2019;t know what Gushantimur was like in the past. But the Gushantimur that he knew in the Black Forest wasn&#x2019;t someone who would follow the grey god.&#xA0;</span><span>Magic power stretched around Gushantimur&#x2019;s body in the air. According to his will, dozens of spheres dropped towards the magic cannons.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Kuok...!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Abaddon extended his power to try and stop Gushantimur&#x2019;s attack, but Crockta struck quickly with God Slayer aimed at the demon.</span></p><p><span>&quot;Hat!&quot;</span></p><p><span>Abaddon barely avoided the attack as one of his arms was cut, flames springing from the wound.</span></p><p><span>&quot;Kuaaaaak!&quot;</span></p><p><span>Abaddon tried to stop the flames from God Slayer, but it didn&#x2019;t work.&#xA0;</span><span>He fell helplessly to the ground.&#xA0;</span><span>In the meantime, all of the magic cannons were destroyed by Gushantimur.&#xA0;</span><span>Once the bombardment ceased, the gods advanced and destroyed the monsters.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>Abaddon panicked.&#xA0;</span><span>&quot;An unidentified shaman at the beginning and now the ancient black dragon, Gushantimur.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Things Abaddon thought would never be broken through were destroyed.&#xA0;</span><span>It was by third beings that they didn&#x2019;t anticipate.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&apos;The heavens are helping me.&#x201D; Crockta said.</span></p><p><span>&quot;The heavens... hahaha, the heavens. Because of the heavens...&#x201D;&#xA0;</span><span>Abaddon laughed.</span></p><p><span>It sounded like something from a black comedy. Crockta also laughed.</span></p><p><span>Abaddon laughed for a while before saying,&#xA0;</span><span>&#x201C;Kill me. I can&apos;t fight anymore.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>The last fire from God Slayer was still eating at his body. The flames rose from his arm to his shoulder, slowly burning his body.</span></p><p><span>Crockta shook his head.&#xA0;</span><span>&quot;I don&#x2019;t intend to kill you.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;If you don&#x2019;t kill me now, I will recover and hit your back.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;If you are able to do so.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Why are you sparing me?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Crockta looked down at him and said,&#xA0;</span><span>&quot;I still need you.&quot;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Need me...?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;You treated me to a wonderful dish. I can&#x2019;t forget that taste.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;......&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;I want to eat your spicy dishes again. So next time...&#x201D;&#xA0;</span><span>Crockta grinned at Abaddon.&#xA0;</span><span>&#x201C;Let&#x2019;s meet at the table.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Then he moved towards the Temple of the Fallen God.</span></p><p><span>Abaddon stared blankly after him.&#xA0;</span><span>&#x201C;Next time...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Abaddon smiled at the words.&#xA0;</span><span>Somehow, he felt carefree. Maybe he secretly hoped for this conclusion. Avoiding death was the instinct of all living things.&#xA0;</span><span>The gods were approaching. Abaddon moved away from the front lines to avoid them.&#xA0;</span><span>He watched as the gods and mortals followed Crockta.</span></p><p><span>&quot;Do you like spicy food?&#x201D;&#xA0;</span><span>Abaddon suddenly asked.</span></p><p><span>Gushantimur was standing next to him in human form.&#xA0;</span><span>A weary face. It was difficult for him to use that degree of breath.</span></p><p><span>Gushantimur replied,&#xA0;</span><span>&quot;I don&#x2019;t like nor dislike it.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Is that so?&#x201D;&#xA0;</span><span>Abaddon said.&#xA0;</span><span>&quot;If there really is a next time...I will make the spicy flavor for you. My spicy noodles are great, even Crockta&#x2019;s acknowledged it.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;I see. I look forward to it. Sincerely.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Hahaha, I&#x2019;m serious...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Above their heads, the white sphere created by the grey god floated.&#xA0;</span><span>Now fate had left their hands. The ending was something that not even the gods could know.</span></p><p><span>The battle for the world&#x2019;s fate ran without pause towards the end.</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p><p><a href="www.wuxiaworld.com">Glossary of Common Korean Terms.</a></p><p>Praise the Orc:&#xA0;<a href="docs.google.com">Glossary Link.&#xA0;</a></p><p>Current schedule:&#xA0;There will now be 14 chapters a week, meaning two chapters every day.</p><p>I have also updated my&#xA0;<a href="www.patreon.com">Patreon</a>&#xA0;to reflect my new novels.
