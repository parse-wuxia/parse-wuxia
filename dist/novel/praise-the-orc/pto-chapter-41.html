<p><span>Chapter 41 - Chesswood (2)</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p><p><span>Crockta didn&#x2019;t like the sound of footsteps behind him.&#xA0;</span><span>He stopped and looked back.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Why do you keep following me?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>But the other person didn&#x2019;t feel intimidated.&#xA0;</span><span>&quot;We&#x2019;re just going the same way, so don&#x2019;t flatter yourself. Did you rent this road? How much did you pay to rent it?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;......&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>It was Derek&#x2019;s subordinate, Jeremy.&#xA0;</span><span>He had caught up as Crockta left Arnin, and headed northeast to Chesswood.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Good, renting is comfortable. Renter, renter, renter, renter...ick.&#x201D; Jeremy</span><span>&#xA0;smiled at Crockta&#x2019;s fierce glare.&#xA0;</span><span>&#x201C;You are scary. Relax, Brother&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;......&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Crockta decided to ignore him. He started moving again.</span></p><p><span>Jeremy whistled from behind him.&#xA0;</span><span>Jeremy&#x2019;s whistling was very clear and high. At first, Crockta thought it was a flute sound. There was a time when he admired it, but now that whistling didn&#x2019;t sound very pleasant.</span></p><p><span>Jeremy&#x2019;s whistle rang throughout the plains.</span></p><p><span>Thus, they continued their awkward companionship.</span></p><p><span>As the name suggested, the Chesswood area that they were heading to had small human villages scattered about in a checkered pattern. Chesswood wasn&#x2019;t a big city like Arnin was, but a cluster of various small villages gathered together with their own system.</span></p><p><span>What was the Thawing Balhae Clan doing there? Would he be able to find Grom&#x2019;s new character, the traitor called Hyunchul, and get revenge?</span></p><p><span>The future was unknown, so he had to do the best that he could right now. Crockta decided to just go there for now.</span></p><p><span>As they headed further east from Arnin, the forest disappeared, and an oft-traveled trail could be seen. If he proceeded to the center of the continent in this direction, he would be able to reach the big cities of the other species.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Hey, Orc brother.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;...I am called Crockta.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Oh. Are we already friendly enough to call each other by name? Is this Day 1 of our relationship?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;......&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Crockta wanted to kill him.</span></p><p><span>&quot;What are you going to do with the cursed people in Chesswood? Are you going to use the Concrete method?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;There is no need to know.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;No, I&#x2019;m Derek&#x2019;s delegate, so I should know if you&#x2019;re planning to do something strange. Our investment might fly away, after all. I need to know since our money is on the line.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Where did Derek invest in Chesswood?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Secret, a secret.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>At the end of his words, Jeremy was standing beside Crockta. Crockta glanced at him but didn&#x2019;t point it out.</span></p><p><span>&quot;Isn&#x2019;t that a good sword? Is it expensive?&#x201D; Jeremy asked.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;It&#x2019;s the work of the Golden Anvil clan.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Hyu, how great. I&#x2019;m envious. I also want to buy a new sword.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>As they talked, the two people started walking together.</span></p><p><span>Jeremy started to whistle again.&#xA0;</span><span>Crockta didn&#x2019;t know where it came from, but there was a melody to it. It wasn&#x2019;t too bad to walk leisurely while listening to Jeremy.</span></p><p><span>&quot;You are good.&#x201D; He said.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&quot;When I was a child, I was proud of both my whistling and my sword skills.&#x201D; Jeremy</span><span>&#xA0;started whistling again. The sound was crisp, and sounded good overall.&#xA0;</span><span>&quot;Orc brother, do you know any songs?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Songs?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;I don&#x2019;t think that a whistle can come out well from an orc&#x2019;s lips, so how about a song? Your voice is pretty good.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;A song.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>There was the orc song that he had learned from a pub in Orcrox. Maybe he should try it once. Crockta coughed. Jeremy looked at him with expectant eyes.</span></p><p><span>&quot;Hmm hmm.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span><span>He cleared his throat. It was slightly embarrassing singing this alone.&#xA0;</span><span>However, he couldn&#x2019;t betray Jeremy&#x2019;s expectations, so he started awkwardly singing the warrior&#x2019;s song.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;We are orcs! The mighty orcs! You&#x2019;ll be in trouble if you mess with us! The great warriors have appeared. Humans, get lost! Elves...get lost! Dwarves, get lost...! Gnomes...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>It was an exciting song when sung in a group, but it was shameful to shout it out alone. The contents of &#x2018;Gnomes, get lost&#x2019; followed by &#x2018;warriors don&#x2019;t need a woman&#x2019; didn&#x2019;t fall from his mouth.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;......&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Jeremy looked taken aback.</span></p><p><span>&quot;......!&quot;</span></p><p><span>Jeremy flashed an awkward and nodded.&#xA0;</span><span>&#x201C;G-Great.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>It was humiliating.&#xA0;</span><span>It would&#x2019;ve been okay if Jeremy had teased him. But even Jeremy wasn&#x2019;t able to make fun of him!&#xA0;</span><span>He even pretended and gave Crockta a compliment!</span></p><p><span>Crockta became anxious and dropped his head.</span></p><p><span>It was impossible for humans to understand the wonderful song of orc warriors. He tried to maintain the spirit of victory. But he was a warrior who could face reality, so he couldn&#x2019;t turn away from his conscious and pride.</span></p><p><span>&quot;Isn&#x2019;t every culture different? Ha, haha.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Crockta felt more shame at Jeremy&#x2019;s nice remark.&#xA0;</span><span>Therefore, Crockta cleared his throat again.&#xA0;</span><span>He wanted to let this guy know what a real song was.</span></p><p><span>He said, &quot;That was just a joke.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&quot;No. The song was good, Brother.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;I will let you hear what a real song is.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;There is no need...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Crockta grabbed Jeremy&#x2019;s shoulder. He flinched.&#xA0;</span><span>&quot;Jeremy.&quot;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Yes...?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Have you ever been in love?&quot;</span></p><p><span>&quot;L...Love?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Yes, love.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;What...I did have a love relationship...?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Then listen.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Crockta was very serious.&#xA0;</span><span>He closed his eyes and remembered the sound.&#xA0;</span><span>Right now he had the low bass tones of an orc that most singers couldn&#x2019;t mimic.</span></p><p><span>He recalled his school days. That boy&#x2019;s genuineness as he wept still breathed in his chest.&#xA0;</span><span>He poured out the distant memories into the lyrics.&#xA0;</span><span>This song would suffice.</span></p><p><span>Crockta&#x2019;s voice poured out like a sigh.</span></p><p><span>&quot;Just like I wasn&#x2019;t prepared for the rain, I sent you away with silence.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;......!&quot;</span></p><p><span>Jeremy&#x2019;s eyes widened. Crockta&#x2019;s voice, which was strangely low, sank calmly.&#xA0;</span><span>The lyrics he sang were beautiful and melancholy, just like a poem.</span></p><p><span>&quot;For a while, I would get drunk or sleep at dawn, trying to forget you.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;......&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;I can&#x2019;t forget that time, I realized something while thinking...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Ah...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Crockta&#x2019;s low voice rang out. The bass tone was filled with heartbreaking emotions.</span></p><p><span>&quot;A good person, if I had cherished you then, I wouldn&#x2019;t have been so sad when we broke up...!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Jeremy closed his eyes.&#xA0;</span><span>Suddenly, an old relationship passed through his mind.</span></p><p><span>Jane. Her name was unforgettable, Jane. Both of them were in love, but she was the daughter of a well known family, and Jeremy was just a swordsman from the back streets. It was a relationship that wasn&#x2019;t possible. A painful love. She eventually left him, but Jeremy couldn&#x2019;t blame her.</span></p><p><span>She...was a good person...&#xA0;</span><span>Jeremy&apos;s eyes became wet.</span></p><p><span>Now Crockta&#x2019;s song was reaching the climax. The end of the heartbreaking love song rang out.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;I would like to say that I will always protect you, please come back again...I&#x2019;ll make amends...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>His song was over.</span></p><p><span>Crockta closed his eyes and become drunk on his emotions for a while. Just like there was black soul in reality, Elder Lord had the orcs. It was a vocal structure that seemed born for this type of song.</span></p><p><span>A stunning performance.</span></p><p><i><span>Clap.</span></i> <i><span>Clap.</span></i> <i><span>Clap.</span></i></p><p><span>He opened his eyes at the sound of applause. It was from Jeremy.&#xA0;</span><span>However, he wasn&#x2019;t the only one applauding. Crockta and Jeremy turned their heads at the same time.&#xA0;</span><span>There was a strange man wiping his watery eyes.</span></p><p><span>&quot;I heard it very well. It was a song that really made me feel like my heart was breaking.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;You...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>The man was carrying a musical instrument resembling a guitar.&#xA0;</span><span>&quot;I am the minstrel Blackmore. I was heading this way when I heard a heartfelt voice by chance. It was a really great song.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;I am embarrassed.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Don&#x2019;t be, Brother. It really was amazing. Your were hiding your singing skills.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span><span>Jeremy also acknowledged Crockta&#x2019;s song.</span></p><p><span>Blackmore asked, &quot;Did you create that song?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;No, I just imitated the song of another singer.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;I see... But the impression you have given me hasn&#x2019;t faded. What is your name?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;I am called Crockta.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Based on your direction, are you perhaps heading to Chesswood?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Yes.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;I am also heading there. Do you mind if I accompany you?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Feel free to do so.&quot;</span></p><p><span>Crockta and Jeremy were joined by Blackmore. A light conversation was started after that as Blackmore asked, </span><span>&quot;The lyrics to that song are especially beautiful. What is the title of the song?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;As the lyrics said, it&#x2019;s called &#x2018;Good Person&#x2019;.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Good Person... How great. If you love a good person, you won&#x2019;t be sad if you break up...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Blackmore nodded and wrote something in his notebook.&#xA0;</span><span>&#x201C;Of course... That doesn&#x2019;t mean that you weren&#x2019;t really sad...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Right...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Kuoh...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Paradoxical lyrics that a man could understand!&#xA0;</span><span>The eyes of the three men became distant. They were gazing at old memories.</span></p><p><span>&quot;I had those days as well... Orc, why are you going to Chesswood? Are you going to participate in the contest...?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Contest?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Ah, you don&#x2019;t know. A small contest for minstrels will be held in Chesswood.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Hoh, really?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;It isn&#x2019;t a big competition. It&#x2019;s a small contest between the Chesswood villages, but the pride of the villages is at stake. I know since I am from Chesswood. That&#x2019;s why I returned home after a long time.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;I would like to see you play.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Hahaha. Please come and watch. I will be singing.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>The conversation continued as they walked along the road.&#xA0;</span><span>They started to enjoy music while walking. Blackmore played his instrument while Jeremy whistled. Crockta hummed along with his bold voice.</span></p><p><span>A jazz conversation with their own melodies!&#xA0;</span><span>It was fun to enjoy the music without worrying.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;What are you talking about?&#x201D;&#xA0;</span><span>Suddenly, a voice was heard. Crockta looked in the direction of the sound.</span></p><p><span>It was a group of humans.&#xA0;</span><span>Crockta didn&#x2019;t miss the white star on the forehead of the woman riding in the lead.</span></p><p><span>&quot;NPCs?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Isn&#x2019;t this a funny combination? Orc musician?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>There were five people, all users.&#xA0;</span><span>Jeremy was unconcerned but Blackmore welcomed them cheerfully. He greeted them.</span></p><p><span>&quot;Hello!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>The woman who seemed to be leading the group laughed and replied.&#xA0;</span><span>&#x201C;Yes, hello. Mister Minstrel!&#x201D;&#xA0;</span><span>She was also friendly to NPCs. She seemed to be familiar with Elder Lord.</span></p><p><span>&quot;I am the minstrel Blackmore, and these two are Crockta and Jeremy, who are accompanying me to Chesswood.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Crockta and Jeremy lightly bowed.</span></p><p><span>&quot;Oh my god, really? We are also going there.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>She turned around and talked briefly with her group. She seemed to be asking if they should join up.&#xA0;</span><span>&quot;Then would you like to go with us? I would like to hear your music. Is everybody here a minstrel?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Hahaha. I am the only minstrel, but they are musically talented.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Wow, great.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Blackmore declared, &quot;Let&#x2019;s go together. Sharing music is a wonderful thing.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>The party increased. There was now a group of eight people heading to Chesswood.</span></p><p><span>Blackmore was returning to his home after a long time, so he started to sing song reminiscent of his hometown. It was a singing skill that was just as wonderful as his skill with the musical instrument. The users clapped in response.</span></p><p><span>Suddenly, Jeremy grabbed the hem of Crockta&#x2019;s clothes and pulled him close.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Huh?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Brother, are they people cursed by the stars?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>He asked in a low voice. He knew that Crockta was one of those cursed by the stars and that they could recognize each other.&#xA0;</span><span>Crockta nodded.&#xA0;</span><span>Jeremy whispered again to Crockta, &quot;Be careful.&quot;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;About what?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Those guys and Chesswood.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Jeremy pulled Crockta a little further away from the group.</span></p><p><span>&quot;Blackmore, I don&#x2019;t think he knows the news yet.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span><span>Jeremy squinted at Blackmore. Blackmore was playing his instrument with a bright face.&#xA0;</span><span>&quot;Chesswood isn&#x2019;t an idle place right now.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Then...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;It is a land of discord due to the cursed people.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>One user suddenly looked at the two of them. Jeremy slung his arm over Crockta and grinned. As the gaze of the user moved away, he whispered again in Crockta&#x2019;s ears.&#xA0;</span><span>&quot;So these people over there are enemies.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;I see.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Certainly, Enyanis of Arnin had referred to Chesswood as in a state of pandemonium.&#xA0;</span><span>Crockta nodded.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Do you understand?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Jeremy hit Crockta&#x2019;s chest and released him. Blackmore&#x2019;s singing became louder.</span></p><p><span>In the distance, the dim shape of a village started to appear.</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p><p>I will be turning off sponsored chapters for BEM and PTO for now while I catch up with Patreon chapters.
