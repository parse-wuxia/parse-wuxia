<p><span>Chapter 165 - Five Senses Landscape (1)</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p><p><span>Inside the city, there were still those who were resisting.</span></p><p><span>&quot;As long as we buy some time, reinforcements will come,&#x201D; said Gerd, the militia leader.</span></p><p><span>However, he wasn&#x2019;t convinced as he spoke.&#xA0;</span><span>The enemies hadn&#x2019;t used their knights yet. The horsemen were circling the city to prevent any fugitives, with only those cursed by the stars entering the city.&#xA0;</span><span>They were having fun as they slaughtered the residents of the city.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Can&#x2019;t we build up a lot of experience here?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Yes, that is why we came here.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;I keep on receiving rewards for the achievements. Wow, this is rare grade.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;I barely get any rare grade rewards. Why can&#x2019;t I receive the Flying Heaven Sword Style?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>They chattered and laughed together.</span></p><p><span>Gerd bit his lip. The ones cursed by the stars were hateful.&#xA0;</span><span>They were all around him.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Endure. We can endure.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Of course, nobody believed those words.&#xA0;</span><span>They were waiting for reinforcements but who would come?&#xA0;</span><span>The empire had a great army. It was a war to win if they just hid behind walls. Entering the city to save them was nothing more than a waste of troops.</span></p><p><span>He repeated to himself,&#xA0;</span><span>&#x201C;Endure...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>But there was a disturbance in the distance. Gerd became tense. The knights might&#x2019;ve entered.</span></p><p><span>&quot;......!&quot;</span></p><p><span>At that moment, he could see something flying over the building in front of him.&#xA0;</span><span>It was the appearance of an enemy who had his body split apart.&#xA0;</span><span>As soon as the red lump fell, it became white particles.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;W-What?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>It continued.&#xA0;</span><span>Behind the outer walls of the building, a fountain of blood appeared in the air.&#xA0;</span><span>There was the sound of screams and bones breaking as the bodies continued to burst. The blood, flesh and internal organs were stuck to the ground.</span></p><p><span>What the hell was going on at the smithy?</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Kyaaak!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Stop!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Monster!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Once again, dozens of people flew through the air at the same time and fell down in the dust.&#xA0;</span><span>Gerd and his companions flinched as they held their weapons.&#xA0;</span><span>The fallen people twitched and died. Their bodies turned white.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Who...?&#x201D;</span></p><p><i><span>Step, step.</span></i></p><p><span>Footsteps could be heard. Gerd gulped and looked at the corner of the building. There was the shadow of a man of great size.&#xA0;</span><span>The slaughterer&#x2019;s image was revealed.&#xA0;</span><span>The first thing that stood out was the gigantic greatsword that reflected the sunlight. It was so big that he couldn&#x2019;t face it properly.</span></p><p><span>&quot;......!&quot;</span></p><p><span>An orc.&#xA0;</span><span>He was burly and the battle scars were mixed together with the tattoos.&#xA0;</span><span>Blood and flesh dripped down from his body.</span></p><p><span>The vicious eyes turned to Gerd.&#xA0;</span><span>Gerd shook.</span></p><p><span>He knew who the orc was.&#xA0;</span><span>The orc warrior widely known throughout the continent. The one who killed the crazy chieftain in the north. All gods had whispered his name.&#xA0;</span><span>Northern Conqueror Crockta.&#xA0;</span><span>He heard rumors that Crockta was going against the empire. But,</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;God...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Showing up on this battlefield was reckless.&#xA0;</span><span>Gerd never imagined his appearance. He knew the orc species, but he always thought of heroes as people with shining smiles and a dignified appearance. They were knights who wore armor.</span></p><p><span>But he was mistaken.&#xA0;</span><span>The orc called Crockta wasn&#x2019;t a knight.&#xA0;</span><span>He was a monster.&#xA0;</span><span>Knights were those who wore shining armor and rode on a white horse in fairy tales.</span></p><p><span>Crockta was a warrior who slaughtered his enemies with his greatsword, scattering the flesh and blood of those who got in his way. If he wasn&#x2019;t killed on the battlefield, he would wipe out all enemies.&#xA0;</span><span>The eyes were filled with killing intent, making Gerd unable to face them at all.</span></p><p><span>But,</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Bul&#x2019;tarrr&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>At Crockta&#x2019;s roar, the enemies didn&#x2019;t dare come closer and fell back.</span></p><p><span>Gerd formed a fist.&#xA0;</span><span>Despite the horrible appearance, hope sprouted in his heart.</span></p><p><span>He had prayed for a long time.&#xA0;</span><span>He prayed every day that he could continue to live as a free man, for the march of the imperial forces to slow down and to help them win this battle. He prayed for all the beautiful things in this world.</span></p><p><span>However, no one answered.&#xA0;</span><span>It wasn&#x2019;t the benevolent goddess or a knight on a white horse who responded.&#xA0;</span><span>It was a brutal orc warrior covered in the enemy&#x2019;s blood. A killer who beheaded the enemies directly.</span></p><p><span>Crockta, he came for them.</span></p><p><span>Gerd shouted,&#xA0;</span><span>&#x201C;Crockta has come! Gather your strength!&#x201D;</span></p><p></p><p style="text-align: center"><span>***</span></p><p></p><p><span>The front lines became messy at Crockta&#x2019;s appearance.&#xA0;</span><span>The enemies rarely came close to Crockta, giving the residents and militia time to reorganize the line of defense.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Crockta!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>The &#x2018;He&#x2019;s an Orc, yet still Praiseworthy&#x2019; members were also present. </span><span>They were very tired. In particular, Gilgamesh was barely holding onto his sword and couldn&#x2019;t exert any further strength.</span></p><p><span>&quot;Meet over there.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Yes.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;There are still people remaining.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Crockta approached Gerd&#x2019;s group.&#xA0;</span><span>They were busy raising the defenses. They held spears carved out of wood and cautiously watched for enemies from behind the barricade.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;I am Crockta. I came to help.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Gerd responded to Crockta.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Thank you. I&#x2019;ve heard a lot of rumors about you.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;More troops will be coming soon.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Rommel was committed to the growth of the clan members. But that changed after Crockta&#x2019;s appearance. Soon the knights and regular soldiers would appear.&#xA0;</span><span>Considering the gap between numbers and level, it was close to a hopeless battle.</span></p><p><span>&quot;Wait for the reinforcements.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Reinforcements...&#x201D;&#xA0;</span><span>Gerd was skeptical about the reinforcements. He shouted about reinforcements to raise morale, but he didn&#x2019;t think they would come.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Believe in them.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span><span>Crockta stated. It was an intense gaze.&#xA0;</span><span>&quot;They will come.&quot;</span></p><p><span>It was hope that made people hold on, even if it was feeble. As long as there was hope, the possibilities could be doubled.&#xA0;</span><span>A miracle could happen as long as it wasn&#x2019;t 0%.</span></p><p><span>&quot;I understand.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span><span>Gerd nodded.</span></p><p><span>Crockta scanned the area.</span></p><p><span>&quot;It is tense.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>They had just joined but there was no time for proper introductions.&#xA0;</span><span>It was the last defense line and the children and elderly were behind it. All of them were now visible.</span></p><p><span>Crockta raised his greatsword.&#xA0;</span><span>It was obviously the worst situation.&#xA0;</span><span>He wanted to protect them, but it was a dangerous situation. However, if there was nothing to protect, there was no reason to fight.</span></p><p><span>It was an irony he always experienced.</span></p><p><span>Crockta opened his mouth.&#xA0;</span><span>&quot;I have been through many battles...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>The formation of the enemies was changing. They had now completely retreated. It meant that reinforcements for the enemies were coming soon.&#xA0;</span><span>The sound of horseshoes neared.</span></p><p><span>&quot;There have been many more dangerous fights. This is nothing. Kulkulkul.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>It was his own method of cheering them on.&#xA0;</span><span>Gerd and the militia members laughed slightly at Crockta&#x2019;s words.</span></p><p><span>&quot;So let&apos;s try our best.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;I understand.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>New enemies appeared.&#xA0;</span><span>Both the White Lion Knights and Blue Dragon Lancers appeared. The regular army followed behind them.&#xA0;</span><span>The Heaven and Earth Clan were still here, surrounding the area in several layers, in order to block any retreat.</span></p><p><span>The number and quality of the other side were no match.</span></p><p><span>Crockta cracked his knuckles.&#xA0;</span><span>As he mentioned, he had experienced more dangerous battlefields. But it was the first time he had to defend people against so many enemies.&#xA0;</span><span>At the very least, he fought with his friends who had the ability to resist the enemy.</span></p><p><span>Even in the north, he had the dark elves who were good hunters and swordsmen.&#xA0;</span><span>This place was different.&#xA0;</span><span>They were at a disadvantage in terms of equipment and skills.&#xA0;</span><span>Maybe everyone would die.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Stay alive.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span><span>He muttered.</span></p><p><span>Gilgamesh spoke from behind him,&#xA0;</span><span>&quot;Is there a &#x2018;stage&#x2019; that finally suits me...? The curtain call will be the screams of the enemies. Kukuk...!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>His voice was dying but his personality was still constant.&#xA0;</span><span>Crockta grinned.&#xA0;</span><span>The enemies came to a stop.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Knights, be prepared!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>The leader of the White Lion Knights in the rear cried out. It was the vice leader Betring, who had taken over for Adandator.&#xA0;</span><span>It was an expression of intent to engage in close combat.&#xA0;</span><span>They started walking on both feet.</span></p><p><span>The militia members readied their arrows. However, none of them hit. They were avoided or blocked using swords and shields. It was truly the empire&#x2019;s elite.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;For His Majesty!&#x201D; Betring shouted in an excited voice that didn&#x2019;t fit his age.</span></p><p><span>&quot;Assault, White Lions!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>The knights started the assault.&#xA0;</span><span>Crockta broke through the knights running at the forefront and shouted, &quot;Come at me, knight!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Crockta&#x2019;s momentum pushed against the knights.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;You&#x2019;re better than expected, Orc!&#x201D;&#xA0;</span><span>It was Betring who didn&#x2019;t back down from Crockta&#x2019;s threat.&#xA0;</span><span>He met Crockta&#x2019;s greatsword as the two swords hit each other.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Now! Charge!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>As Betring shouted, the knights plunged towards Crockta&#x2019;s left and right.&#xA0;</span><span>Crockta tried to stop them, but Betring&#x2019;s sword persistently pursued him. Crockta struck him in annoyance.&#xA0;</span><span>Betring continued to mark Crockta.&#xA0;</span><span>He wasn&#x2019;t trying to kill Crockta, and didn&#x2019;t even intend for this to be a confrontation. He just stuck to Crockta so that Crockta couldn&#x2019;t go anywhere else.</span></p><p><span>Crockta grit his teeth.</span></p><p><span>An expert. This was annoying.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Aaack!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>The knights didn&#x2019;t hesitate. The residents died as the knights&#x2019; swords pierced their hearts.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;It is shameful.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Ho?&#x201D; Betring asked nervously as he attacked Crockta.</span></p><p><span>&quot;A knight should be ashamed of this behavior.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>The ruined city.&#xA0;</span><span>The dead or dying residents.&#xA0;</span><span>The flag of the empire flying in the air.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Shame...&#x201D;&#xA0;</span><span>Betring smiled bitterly.&#xA0;</span><span>&quot;Old people like me don&#x2019;t worry about things like that.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>It was a familiar expression that he had seen in the north on Hammerchwi, a brave man who had been bent from many years of inertia while adrift in a world mixed with right and wrong.</span></p><p><span>&quot;I understand,&#x201D; said Crockta before his figure disappeared.&#xA0;</span><span>Then Crockta appeared right in front of Betring&#x2019;s nose with Ogre Slayer at his neck.</span></p><p><span>&quot;......!&quot;</span></p><p><span>An enormous pressure was aiming for his neck. He couldn&#x2019;t avoid or block it. Betring&apos;s head became blank.</span></p><p><i><span>Kakang!</span></i></p><p><span>Just before Ogre Slayer reached Betring, the sword was blocked.&#xA0;</span><span>It was from the spear of a Blue Dragon member.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Don&#x2019;t overdo it.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Thank you for your help. Bluno.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>The two leaders of the empire&#x2019;s knights stood in front of Crockta.&#xA0;</span><span>They gulped. Even if they joined together, they couldn&#x2019;t beat Crockta.&#xA0;</span><span>They could only buy some time.&#xA0;</span><span>The orc in front of him was a monster.</span></p><p><span>&quot;Come all at once!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>At the same time, Crockta&#x2019;s greatsword aimed at both of them.&#xA0;</span><span>Betring bounced back and rolled across the ground. Bluno avoided it then swung his spear.&#xA0;</span><span>Crockta ducked and kicked Bluno&#x2019;s abdomen. Bluno collapsed.</span></p><p><span>The greatsword descended towards Betring.&#xA0;</span><span>He blocked with his sword. The blade couldn&#x2019;t overcome the impact and was broken. Betring&#x2019;s face stiffened.&#xA0;</span><span>Crockta raised his greatsword again. Betring rolled across the ground. It was ugly behavior for a knight, but it allowed him to barely survive.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Aaaaaaah!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Bluno attacked. It was a rapid stinging attack that made him one of the best knights.&#xA0;</span><span>Crockta grabbed the spear.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Crazy!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Crockta started to break the spear. Bluno stumbled at the power placed on his spear.&#xA0;</span><span>He gritted his teeth and tried to aim the spear again.</span></p><p><span>Crockta struck his shin with a fist.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Cough!&#x201D;&#xA0;</span><span>Bluno flew back and crashed onto the ground. His shin was broken. He grabbed his leg and moaned.&#xA0;</span><span>Betring looked at it and muttered.&#xA0;</span><span>&#x201C;Truly a monster...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>His face was completely frightened.</span></p><p><span>Crockta looked around.&#xA0;</span><span>The knights were already slaughtering the residents.&#xA0;</span><span>Crockta headed towards the knights, ignoring Betring and Bluno. However, it wasn&#x2019;t enough for him to block them alone.</span></p><p><span>Countless people were dying.&#xA0;</span><span>The Heaven and Earth members were pushing to the front like hyenas.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Come again!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Get those bastards!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Cheeky bastards!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Their goal was the &#x2018;He&#x2019;s an Orc, yet still Praiseworthy&#x2019; members.</span></p><p><span>&quot;The garbage who follow the orc!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Kukuk...weak dogs are barking?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;What is he saying?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>In the middle of it, Crockta shook his head.&#xA0;</span><span>The knights and residents, users and users, everything was mixed up and confusing. The debris of the destroyed buildings was scattered about.</span></p><p><span>&#x2018;Now you see that the world is full of death.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span>The system message seemed to be mocking him.&#xA0;</span><span>Crockta jumped over a knight. Betring was chasing him from behind. Crockta wanted to go after the knights killing the residents. Betring&#x2019;s blade cut his thigh.</span></p><p><span>Crockta looked angrily at Betring, but he had already withdrawn. Meanwhile, residents were dying. Crockta gritted his teeth. The moment Betring retreated, weapons flew at Crockta from all sides.</span></p><p><span>Crockta roared and swung his greatsword. The knights flew back.</span></p><p><i><span>Puok!</span></i></p><p><span>&#x201C;Ugh!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>An arrow struck Crockta&#x2019;s shoulder.&#xA0;</span><span>It was difficult to respond because there were so many people.&#xA0;</span><span>Crockta used the power of a Hero. It consumed a lot of stamina but it couldn&#x2019;t be helped.&#xA0;</span><span>Crockta slaughtered the enemies with the power of causality. A fountain of blood.</span></p><p><span>Nevertheless, the number of teammates was decreasing.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Gerd!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>There was no answer.&#xA0;</span><span>He had died a long time ago.</span></p><p><span>&quot;Shit!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>The corpses were accumulating.&#xA0;</span><span>He couldn&#x2019;t save everyone. The consequences of death were overflowing in the city, and there was a limit to how much he could reverse.</span></p><p><span>&quot;......!&quot;</span></p><p><span>Suddenly, white particles were scattered.&#xA0;</span><span>He looked back. The &#x2018;He&#x2019;s an Orc, yet still Praiseworthy&#x2019; members were dying.&#xA0;</span><span>Alex&#x2019;s eyes met his as he turned into white particles. He nodded with a pale face. That was the last action.</span></p><p><span>Their particles and those of the Heaven and Earth members, along with the dust, blurred his vision.</span></p><p><span>&quot;Hell, this is a place that suits me! Come you, you dog-like bastards.&quot;</span></p><p><span>Gilgamesh was the only one remaining and he had lost his concept.&#xA0;</span><span>He could no longer manipulate the blades and wielded them directly. However, his weapons were quickly suppressed.&#xA0;</span><span>Crockta tried to rescue him, but the knights kept blocking him. Several layers of infantry surrounded him.</span></p><p><span>&quot;Dammit.&quot;&#xA0;</span><span>Crockta raised his greatsword.&#xA0;</span><span>He was about to use strength to break through the encirclement.</span></p><p><span>&quot;I&#x2019;ve caught this bastard! Concrete method!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Tie him up! Rope!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Kukuk...oof...kuk...!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Crockta ran in Gilgamesh&#x2019;s direction.&#xA0;</span><span>A blade stuck in his back. Blood splattered but he ignored it and attacked those in front of him. He stepped on the enemies.&#xA0;</span><span>Gilgamesh could be seen in the distance.</span></p><p><span>&quot;Gilgamesh!&quot;</span></p><p><span>Crockta broke through the enemies to try and save him, but he was blocked again. There was no end. He was surrounded by the enemy.&#xA0;</span><span>There was even the bombardment from magicians. Fireballs flew at Crockta.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Bul&#x2019;tarrr&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Crockta ignored it all and threw his greatsword.</span></p><p><span>&quot;......!&quot;</span></p><p><span>Ogre Slayer split apart Gilgamesh&#x2019;s body.&#xA0;</span><span>Gilgamesh was split in half.&#xA0;</span><span>With only his upper body left, he stared at Crockta. There was surprise in Gilgamesh&#x2019;s eyes before he laughed. Crockta chuckled slightly.</span></p><p><span>Soon, Crockta&#x2019;s body was hit by a fireball.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Cough!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Crockta rolled on the ground. The flames burned his body. Crockta gritted his teeth. Blades flew in succession.&#xA0;</span><span>Crockta raised his body and knocked them down with his fists.&#xA0;</span><span>The enemies were ripped to pieces.</span></p><p><span>Crockta straightened his waist and looked around.</span></p><p><span>&quot;Kulkulkul...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>He laughed.&#xA0;</span><span>Now Crockta was alone.&#xA0;</span><span>The militia, the elderly people and the &#x2018;He&#x2019;s an Orc, yet still Praiseworthy&#x2019; members...</span></p><p><span>They all died.&#xA0;</span><span>He was left alone.</span></p><p><span>He knew.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Kill!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;He is alone!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Everyone charge!&quot;</span></p><p><span>From the beginning, he had a feeling it would be like this.&#xA0;</span><span>Nevertheless, he had no choice but to struggle.</span></p><p><i><span>Kaack!</span></i> <i><span>Kaack!</span></i> <i><span>Kaaack!</span></i></p><p><span>He looked up at the sky.</span></p><p><span>Crows were crying out above his head.&#xA0;</span><span>Auspicious or a disaster.&#xA0;</span><span>It was said that crows were birds who lead the souls of the dead to the afterlife.&#xA0;</span><span>How did the landscape look like in their eyes? He wondered if the souls of the dead were filling this land in white.</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p><p>My Q&amp;A ended up being delayed to today at the normal time.
