<p><span>Chapter 138 - Era of Regret</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p><p><span>Time was like running water.</span></p><p><span>For ancient kingdoms that had perished, after a long time, a historian would pass through the ruined city and say things like &#x2018;the old fields were overgrown with barley, and they were rich in rice stalks and millets.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span>There were things that people hoped wouldn&#x2019;t change.&#xA0;</span><span>However, the might of time changed everything.&#xA0;</span><span>Everything they believed wouldn&#x2019;t change would actually fade someday.&#xA0;</span><span>A new era wasn&#x2019;t a decline, but a resurrection. Nevertheless, there were those who missed the past and lamented that things weren&#x2019;t the same.</span></p><p><span>It was the same for Crockta.</span></p><p><span>He headed towards the &#x2018;Where are my Brothers?&#x2019; pub.&#xA0;</span><span>At the entrance, there was a refreshing smell that he hadn&#x2019;t expected to exist: a feminine perfume scent mixed with flowers and citrus. The sharpness of the scent&#x2019;s top notes pierced his nose.&#xA0;</span><span>Clear laughter surrounded him as he entered the pub.</span></p><p><span>The waitress approached and welcomed, &#x201C;Hello, how can I help you?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Crockta raised his head.&#xA0;</span><span>A young and fresh girl.&#xA0;</span><span>The menu had all types of dishes nearly listed.&#xA0;</span><span>There were sets available for a large group of people. There were also couple sets. In the midst of this confusion, Crockta could only gaze desperately at the menu.</span></p><p><span>This wasn&#x2019;t an illusion.&#xA0;</span><span>He knew this was the place.&#xA0;</span><span>This was the &#x2018;Where are my Brothers?&#x2019; pub.</span></p><p><span>Crockta forcibly opened his mouth and spoke without checking the menu.</span></p><p><span>&quot;Cream spaghetti.&quot;</span></p><p><span>The expression of the employee didn&#x2019;t change.</span></p><p><span>&quot;...And chopsticks.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>There was a bright smile.&#xA0;</span><span>She replied &#x2018;Yes&#x2019; in a cheerful voice and left.</span></p><p><span>Crockta raised his head.&#xA0;</span><span>Nobody was laughing at him.&#xA0;</span><span>Crockta sank wearily into the chair.&#xA0;</span><span>At the next table, a man and woman burst out laughing. Behind him were some youths that were whispering together.</span></p><p><span>He didn&#x2019;t know where to look.&#xA0;</span><span>It was confusing rather than shameful.&#xA0;</span><span>He felt a mixed sense of insult and betrayal.&#xA0;</span><span>This was the &#x2018;Where are my Brothers?&#x2019; pub; but it had now turned into a fusion pub with a bright atmosphere that was aimed at young people.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Here is your cream spaghetti. Please enjoy!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Crockta accepted the plate of cream spaghetti with chopsticks nearly arranged on the table.&#xA0;</span><span>There was even a mat to place the chopsticks.&#xA0;</span><span>But what now?&#xA0;</span><span>He placed the chopsticks in the cream spaghetti like he was holding a knife.&#xA0;</span><span>The noodles were like the enemies.</span></p><p><span>Crockta ate the cream spaghetti.&#xA0;</span><span>It was delicious, causing him to became sadder.</span></p><p><span>Suddenly,</span></p><p><span>&#x2018;An orc ordering cream spaghetti... This isn&#x2019;t a comedy!&#x2019;</span></p><p><span>Crockta raised his head. He looked around but didn&#x2019;t see the owner of the voice.&#xA0;</span><span>It was a hallucination.</span></p><p><span>&#x2018;Isn&#x2019;t that a dish for girls? Kukukuk...&#x2019;</span></p><p><span>He continued using his chopsticks as the suppressed memories rose.</span></p><p><span>&#x2018;Will he also order strawberry juice and a kiwi parfait? Kelkelkel...!&#x2019;</span></p><p><span>These voices were only heard in his head.&#xA0;</span><span>Instead, silly conversations such as &#x2018;Cream spaghetti is delicious,&#x2019; &#x2018;Shall we eat?&#x2019; and &#x2018;Is there a menu like that?&#x2019; entered his ears.</span></p><p><span>&#x2018;The old fields are overgrown with barley, and they were are rich in rice stalks and millets.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span>Crockta thought with longing as he chewed on his cream spaghetti.&#xA0;</span><span>Then he drew an inverted triangle with the last piece of cream spaghetti.&#xA0;</span><span>He waited.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Hey, Orc.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span><span>It was the voice from his memories. Crockta got up from his spot.&#xA0;</span><span>It was the owner of the &#x2018;Where are my Brothers?&#x2019; and the head of the Information Guild&#x2019;s branch in Maillard.</span></p><p><span>That man.</span></p><p><span>The two didn&#x2019;t greet each other. Crockta wanted to blame him, but couldn&#x2019;t open his mouth because of the deep look in the owner&#x2019;s eyes.&#xA0;</span><span>He could tell that they shared the same feelings.</span></p><p><span>&quot;Come here.&quot;</span></p><p><span>He guided Crockta to another place.</span></p><p></p><p style="text-align: center"><span>***</span></p><p></p><p><span>The interior of the pub was changed, but the secret passage was still there.&#xA0;</span><span>They walked through a door and entered the basement.&#xA0;</span><span>There was a table in the room and it gave off the feeling of an interrogation room.</span></p><p><span>The two sat facing each other.&#xA0;</span><span>Back here, there were no differences.</span></p><p><span>&quot;You have become big. It hasn&#x2019;t been so long since I&#x2019;ve seen you,&#x201D; the owner said with a mock bow. </span></p><p><span>Crockta replied in a profound manner, &quot;It has been a long time, long enough for things to change.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;&#x2026;&#x2026;&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>The man laughed bitterly. Then he changed the topic.</span></p><p><span>&quot;Yes, well, didn&#x2019;t you come because of the Thawing Balhae Clan? A group of those who have been cursed by the stars. In the meantime, I&#x2019;ve gained enough information. Northern Conqueror Crockta who rebuilt the north.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;How do you know that?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;A divine message came down to the temples. All the gods whispered your name. Crossing the northern limit line, conquering the north and preventing a terrible war. The hero of the north who killed the crazy chieftain.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Crockta nodded. There would be more gods on the continent apart from the grey god, the world tree or the &#x2018;Tribulation&#x2019; that he killed.&#xA0;</span><span>The system messages for users were regarded as divine messages for the inhabitants of Elder Lord.</span></p><p><span>The man pulled out some information.</span></p><p><span>Crockta read through the contents in turn.</span></p><p><span>It was as expected. The Thawing Balhae members had joined the Heaven and Earth Clan. The Thawing Balhae&#x2019;s clan leader and Grom, no Hyunchul. He had the new name &#x2018;Luin&#x2019; and was part of the Heaven and Earth Clan.&#xA0;</span><span>They combined their abilities with the combat capabilities of &#x2018;Rommel&#x2019; Choi Hansung, the so-called genius of war.&#xA0;</span><span>In the land of the south, he was in touch with the nobles and planning more wars.</span></p><p><span>Indeed, the Information Guild had gathered a lot of information while he was in the north.&#xA0;</span><span>There weren&#x2019;t only one or two documents. There were several hypothetical scenarios of what they would do in the future.</span></p><p><span>&quot;Too bad.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>The man looked up at Crockta&#x2019;s words.&#xA0;</span><span>&quot;Sorry, is it not enough? It isn&#x2019;t easy to obtain such information.&quot;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;I&#x2019;m not talking about the information. The information is excellent.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;......&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>The man was silent.&#xA0;</span><span>Crockta wasn&#x2019;t talking about the information. The man knew very well what Crockta was talking about.</span></p><p><span>&quot;The transaction will continue in the future. Thanks for the information.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;...You&#x2019;re welcome.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>They got up from their seats.&#xA0;</span><span>The Information Guild&#x2019;s branch manager touched his chin and called out to Crockta again.&#xA0;</span><span>&quot;Wait. I have one more thing.&quot;&#xA0;</span><span>He placed his hand back in the small hole in the wall. It was the hole where the guild members handed him the materials.&#xA0;</span><span>Then he handed new documents to Crockta.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;It is a gift.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;A gift?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;A gift for the orc warrior who saved the continent.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Crockta received the papers.&#xA0;</span><span>It was a single document with the tag &#x2018;Uncertain&#x2019; on it.</span></p><p><span>&quot;Uncertain data shouldn&#x2019;t be distributed, but I will show you this specifically. It still isn&#x2019;t clear but I thought you should know.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Crockta&#x2019;s eyes widened. The information was shocking.&#xA0;</span><span>The Heaven and Earth Clan was preparing for a larger war after sweeping through the north.&#xA0;</span><span>And their goal...</span></p><p><span>It was all the orcs on the continent, including Orcrox.&#xA0;</span><span>The current relationship between humans and orcs weren&#x2019;t good. The reason he chose the greatsword, the greatsword master Leyteno had fought for the orcs in the war, and the remnants of that war still remained.</span></p><p><span>Now the uncomfortable relationship was like a tradition.&#xA0;</span><span>They were planning to drive a wedge between the two species to create a bigger war. It wasn&#x2019;t enough to kill Lenox, they wanted to trample on the rest of the orcs.</span></p><p><span>It was just a &#x2018;quest&#x2019; and &#x2018;game content&#x2019; to them.</span></p><p><i><span>Crunch.</span></i></p><p><span>Crockta gritted his teeth.&#xA0;</span><span>There were more reasons to crush them.</span></p><p><span>&quot;Thank you.&quot;</span></p><p><span>The owner extended his hand. Crockta shook it.&#xA0;</span><span>The two of them exchanged a look and came up to the pub.</span></p><p><span>Once again, it was an unfamiliar landscape.&#xA0;</span><span>This was the &#x2018;Where are my Brothers?&#x2019; pub that was a front for the Information Guild. But now, it had surpassed its purpose of simple camouflage.&#xA0;</span><span>In times where business was becoming increasingly difficult, the Information Guild had to renovate while thinking of profit. The pub was now a business, not a camouflage.</span></p><p><span>It was a decision barely made after some suffering.&#xA0;</span><span>He knew it with his head.&#xA0;</span><span>Nevertheless, Crockta couldn&#x2019;t help feeling regret.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;...The pub has changed a lot.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;It can&apos;t be helped. The deficit would&#x2019;ve continued otherwise.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Crockta looked at the flirtatious couples and the young men and women whispering together, and admitted that times had changed.&#xA0;</span><span>It had become too perky.&#xA0;</span><span>The males full of masculinity would be long gone.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Hey.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span><span>Crockta looked at the owner of the Information Guild with sad eyes.&#xA0;</span><span>&quot;A roasted pig, is it possible to get that here?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;......!&quot;</span></p><p><span>&quot;I would like to eat a whole roasted pig...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>The owner&#x2019;s eyes widened. He dropped his head like he couldn&#x2019;t bear looking at Crockta anymore.&#xA0;</span><span>He hesitated a moment before barely opening his mouth.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;That menu...&#x201D;&#xA0;</span><span>He smiled and continued speaking.&#xA0;</span><span>&quot;I don&apos;t have that dish anymore.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Times had changed.&#xA0;</span><span>The stories of the real men who ridiculed cream spaghetti, hated fruit juice, and chewed on big pieces of meat were over.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;I see.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span><span>Crockta nodded.&#xA0;</span><span>&quot;I will have whiskey. A bottle please.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>The owner handed over the whiskey.&#xA0;</span><span>Crockta paid the price and opened the lid.&#xA0;</span><span>He took a sip straight from the bottle of whiskey.</span></p><p><span>&quot;Heol, look at that person...!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Oh my, what is this? That orc?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;He is drinking from the bottle. Aiyah. Isn&#x2019;t that a strong whiskey?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Amazing, amazing!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Crockta laughed.</span></p><p><span>These young ones.&#xA0;</span><span>In the past, there was a time when one would be teased if they didn&#x2019;t do this.&#xA0;</span><span>It was the era of real males.</span></p><p><span>Crockta started moving. He headed towards the exit of the &#x2018;Where are my Brothers?&#x2019; pub.&#xA0;</span><span>Looking at the bright faces of the couples coming in, Crockta thought this wasn&#x2019;t too bad either.&#xA0;</span><span>The men and women smiled as they looked at each other.&#xA0;</span><span>There was obvious affection in their eyes.</span></p><p><span>This was also good.</span></p><p><span>Crockta grabbed the door.&#xA0;</span><span>He pushed at the cold handle. The door closed behind him.&#xA0;</span><span>He walked away from the &#x2018;Where are my Brothers?&#x2019; pub.&#xA0;</span><span>A gust of wind blew through the streets of Maillard and past him.</span></p><p><span>He suddenly turned his head.&#xA0;</span><span>He could see the scenery of Maillard. The lights shining, the drunkards on the streets, people heading home to prepare for a lively day tomorrow.&#xA0;</span><span>Somewhere out there, the men would still be living their lives.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;There is no need for regrets&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x2018;Where are my Brothers?&#x2019; might&#x2019;ve turned into a lively fusion bar but their place in Maillard hadn&#x2019;t completely disappeared.&#xA0;</span><span>Somewhere in &#xA0;Maillard, the manly men would still be moving.</span></p><p><span>&quot;I am just a little sad.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span><span>Crockta raised the whiskey bottle. He didn&#x2019;t drink from it.&#xA0;</span><span>Crockta tilted it.&#xA0;</span><span>The whiskey poured out onto the ground.</span></p><p><span>&quot;For the real men who aren&#x2019;t here anymore.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>He poured out all of the whiskey.&#xA0;</span><span>A tribute to the past.&#xA0;</span><span>He recalled the beautiful time and the manly men.</span></p><p><span>He drank towards a bygone era.</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p><p><a href="www.wuxiaworld.com">Glossary of Common Korean Terms.</a></p><p>Praise the Orc:&#xA0;<a href="docs.google.com">Glossary Link.&#xA0;</a></p><p>Current schedule:&#xA0;There will now be 14 chapters a week, meaning two chapters every day.</p><p>I have also updated my&#xA0;<a href="www.patreon.com">Patreon</a>&#xA0;to reflect my new novels.
