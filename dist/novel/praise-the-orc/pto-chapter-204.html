<p><span>Chapter 204 - War of the Gods (2)</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p><p><span>The orcs and the expedition troops mixed together.&#xA0;</span><span>Among them was Anya, who was randomly wielding her axe and screaming, &#x201C;Die! Die! Die!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>They were two small throwing axes. It was the best tool for slaughtering in her hands.&#xA0;</span><span>All the enemies around her were killed by the axes.&#xA0;</span><span>She noticed the faces of those in the distance.</span></p><p><span>&quot;Don&#x2019;t run away and come here! I will play with you!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>She licked the blood on her cheek and giggled.&#xA0;</span><span>Her shoulders trembled before she suddenly threw her axe. The backs of those running away were split.</span></p><p><span>&quot;If you don&#x2019;t come then I will kill you!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>She kept on throwing her axes. They accurately hit the heads of the expedition soldiers.&#xA0;</span><span>She laughed loudly,&#xA0;</span><span>&#x201C;Hahahahat!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>It was a frenzy suitable for the title of &#x2018;Mad Slaughterer.&#x2019;&#xA0;</span><span>Her berserkers followed her.</span></p><p><span>&quot;Come on!&quot;</span></p><p><span>&quot;If you don&apos;t want to die then kill us!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Kakakakat!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>It didn&#x2019;t matter about the power of the gods or their morale. The berserkers stabbed, cut and slashed. Blood sprang from the wounds and they died.&#xA0;</span><span>It was sufficient.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Let&#x2019;s go, Kids. Follow me!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Yes!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Understood!&quot;</span></p><p><span>She took out a new axe from her waist.&#xA0;</span><span>She turned it round and round, wondering who to kill next.&#xA0;</span><span>At that moment, the ground shook.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Oh my?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>It was coming from Kumarak&#x2019;s direction. She looked around.&#xA0;</span><span>The earthquake wasn&#x2019;t the work of Kumarak. It was caused by the dwarf paladin that he was going against.</span></p><p><span>&quot;Hrm...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Anya examined them. Kumarak was bloody and barely standing. On the other hand, the dwarf fighting him was unfamiliar.&#xA0;</span><span>He wielded the hammer towards Kumarak.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;What, that person is a god?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>The light around the dwarf was proof of a god&#x2019;s power.</span></p><p><span>&quot;I told you...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>She had never fought a god before. They were also hiding behind the temples, speaking a few condescending words and giving off a good impression.&#xA0;</span><span>Those beings were coming down directly to get rid of the orcs.</span></p><p><span>&quot;How interesting.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>The dwarf wielded the hammer. Kumarak blocked with Destroyer but was thrown back from the shock.&#xA0;</span><span>Anya felt somewhat uncomfortable as she looked at Kumarak on the ground.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Stupid guy.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Kumarak was a powerful warrior.&#xA0;</span><span>However, that strength he was so proud of was losing. The dwarf kicked the fallen orc.&#xA0;</span><span>Anya spoke to her subordinates.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;You fight here. I will be going somewhere for a while.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Yes!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>She jumped forward. She trampled and killed the soldiers in her way.&#xA0;</span><span>Her goal was Kumarak.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Kumarak!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>However, her voice didn&#x2019;t reach.&#xA0;</span><span>Kumarak ran towards the dwarf again. He looked terrible but he didn&#x2019;t lose his fighting spirit. Rather, he wielded Destroyer with crazy eyes.&#xA0;</span><span>The hammer and axe collided. Kumarak and the dwarf glared at each other.</span></p><p><span>Kumarak suddenly swung his fist. It hit the dwarf&#x2019;s face.&#xA0;</span><span>The dwarf&#x2019;s face distorted and he swung his fist as well. Kumarak&#x2019;s teeth were broken.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Grrung!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Kumarak swung his fists again.&#xA0;</span><span>Thus, they continued punching each other. It was a struggle against a god.&#xA0;</span><span>They dropped their weapons and tangled together. Kumarak&#x2019;s fighting spirit was contagious as the god cried out in a loud voice.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Kumarakkk! I will kill you!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Come on, Tartatod! God of the worms!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Tartatod.</span></p><p><span>Anya understood the whole situation.&#xA0;</span><span>Kumarak had smashed a mountain and killed the great worm, gaining the title of &#x2018;Mountain Smasher.&#x2019;&#xA0;</span><span>So this god must be Tartatod, the one who loved those who dug under the ground. He appeared in front of Kumarak to get revenge for Almutad.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;The gods are the same as us.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Anya&#x2019;s mouth twitched.</span></p><p><span>She didn&#x2019;t believe in those who called themselves gods. Look, they were no different from the creatures on the ground. How could she join her hands together and say a prayer when the god was shrieking and swinging his fists.</span></p><p><span>They were just beings with mighty powers.&#xA0;</span><span>Just that.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Are you going there to intervene?&#x201D;&#xA0;</span><span>Someone asked her.</span></p><p><span>Anya recoiled.&#xA0;</span><span>A woman approached her. It was one of the rare elves who joined the expedition, wearing the clothing of a priest.</span></p><p><span>&quot;You must face me first.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>It was a woman she had never seen before.&#xA0;</span><span>Anya instantly knew who she was. She burst out laughing.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Ahaha. You?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;......&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;It is an honor for a celebrity to look for me. Do you know how to fight?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>The opponent smiled.&#xA0;</span><span>A god who always showed mercy.&#xA0;</span><span>The god everyone praise, who gave the powerful of healing and passed on teachings to help the poor.&#xA0;</span><span>The goddess of mercy.</span></p><p><span>&quot;You are the most notable.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;It is an honor.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;There is the blood of many on your hands.&#x201D; The goddess of mercy said.&#xA0;</span><span>Mad Slaughterer Anya.&#xA0;</span><span>She was in direct opposition to the goddess of mercy.&#xA0;</span><span>&#x201C;Now it is time to stop the tragedies you created.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Stop the tragedies.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span><span>Anya laughed.</span></p><p><span>She pointed to the battlefield.&#xA0;</span><span>Orcs and expedition members were killing each other and dying.&#xA0;</span><span>Both sides were engulfed in their own madness and didn&#x2019;t hesitate to attack. They wielded their weapons until they stopped breathing.</span></p><p><span>It was pandemonium.</span></p><p><span>Anya continued, &quot;You also created this battlefield so you are just a hypocrite. If you combine all the things I&#x2019;ve done in my life, it will look like a comedy compared to the tragedy that you committed today.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;......&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>The god&#x2019;s face shook before calming.</span></p><p><span>Anya smiled.&#xA0;</span><span>&#x201C;It can&#x2019;t be helped. Let&#x2019;s start quickly.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Kumarak&#x2019;s roar was heard from behind her.</span></p><p><span>&quot;God, is it up to hereeeeeeeeeee&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Then something exploded.&#xA0;</span><span>It didn&#x2019;t stop there. The earth broke and collapsed. She didn&#x2019;t know where and how it happened, but there were screams from those caught up in the aftermath.&#xA0;</span><span>Anya laughed as she twirled the two small axes in both hands.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Don&#x2019;t you have to help your friend soon?&#x201D;</span></p><p></p><p style="text-align: center"><span>***</span></p><p></p><p><span>Zankus limped.&#xA0;</span><span>The hunter, hidden somewhere on the battlefield, continued to fire.&#xA0;</span><span>Zankus also responded, but the opponent&#x2019;s shooting was faster and more accurate.</span></p><p><span>It wasn&#x2019;t a large difference.&#xA0;</span><span>However, it was the divide that separated life and death.&#xA0;</span><span>Zankus gritted his teeth and bandaged the wound on his thigh. Even now, the enemy was still aiming at him. Zankus could feel the killing intent.</span></p><p><span>Truly a god.&#xA0;</span><span>Zankus didn&#x2019;t know what to do.</span></p><p><span>&quot;Dammit.&quot;</span></p><p><span>Thus, he decided to borrow someone else&#x2019;s opinion.&#xA0;</span><span>He closed his eyes.&#xA0;</span><span>In the middle of the battlefield, an invisible hunter was aiming for his life. He stared at the darkness behind his eyelids.&#xA0;</span><span>A man was standing there.</span></p><p><span>Shakan.&#xA0;</span><span>The best hunter he knew, Shakan.&#xA0;</span><span>In this moment of urgency, he only had the chance for one question.</span></p><p><span>Zankus threw a question towards the man,&#xA0;</span><span>&#x2018;How can I hunt this enemy?&#x2019;</span></p><p><span>Shakan replied.</span></p><p><span>Zankus&#x2019; eyes opened.&#xA0;</span><span>A light was heading towards him.&#xA0;</span><span>It was quite close.&#xA0;</span><span>Just before it hit his head...</span></p><p><span>Zankus twisted as an arrow grazed his cheek.&#xA0;</span><span>Zankus muttered as he stared at where the light had come from, &#x201C;I understand, Shakan.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Then he loaded an arrow. The iron was distorted.&#xA0;</span><span>In the gap between the expedition troops, there was a shadow standing alone between flapping flags.</span></p><p><span>That guy.</span></p><p><span>Zankus fired an arrow.&#xA0;</span><span>The shadow that fought with him disappeared, but the bodies of the expedition members nearby exploded.&#xA0;</span><span>Zankus wasn&#x2019;t satisfied and quickly pursued the enemy with his next arrow.</span></p><p><span>The arrow&#x2019;s tip aimed at the enemy&#x2019;s figure.&#xA0;</span><span>He pulled back the bowstring as he recalled Shakan&#x2019;s answer.</span></p><p><span>&apos;You can&#x2019;t hunt him.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span>He borrowed the image of Shakan and asked for an answer.&#xA0;</span><span>Zankus couldn&#x2019;t hunt down the enemy, as the other person was a better hunter than him.&#xA0;</span><span>So he decided to give up hunting.</span></p><p><span>&quot;Today, I&#x2019;m not a hunter...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Zankus&#x2019; arrow went straight through some passing soldiers. The soldiers were killed. The knights who faced the orcs were caught in the aftermath. The knights were killed. The shield of a noble was pierced. The noble also died.</span></p><p><span>&quot;Today&#x2026; I must be a killer.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Soon after, his &#x2018;death shot&#x2019; hit the enemy.&#xA0;</span><span>He avoided a fatal wound, but it was unavoidable to receive a shallow hit.&#xA0;</span><span>The enemy sat down and shook with hostility.&#xA0;</span>However, he didn&#x2019;t die.</p><p><span>&quot;You will die soon enough.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span><span>Zankus laughed and aimed his arrow again.</span></p><p><span>His title was &#x2018;Sun Killer.&#x2019;&#xA0;</span><span>It wasn&#x2019;t about hunting. &#x2018;Killer&#x2019; was another name for Zankus.&#xA0;</span><span>This wasn&#x2019;t an ordinary arrow, but one that contained the archer&#x2019;s will.&#xA0;</span><span>It was placed in the arrow.&#xA0;</span><span>How far was his limit?&#xA0;</span><span>Zankus had endlessly practiced with the bow, to the point where he was able to place &#x2018;death&#x2019; in the arrow.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Die.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Now he was in the area of &#x2018;killing&#x2019;, rather than &#x2018;hunting.&#x2019;&#xA0;</span><span>Zankus&#x2019;s arrow aimed at the black shadow again.&#xA0;</span><span>Zankus was unable to move properly in the aftermath of &#x2018;death.&#x2019; Zankus was convinced that the enemy would die by this arrow.</span></p><p><span>But at that moment.</span></p><p><span>A brilliant light erased his arrow.</span></p><p><span>&quot;......!&quot;</span></p><p><span>Everyone on the battlefield looked up at the sky as they saw a flash of brilliant light.&#xA0;</span><span>It came from an old man with wings of light. The staff in his hand shook.&#xA0;</span><span>Then rays of light surrounded the expedition members. Light shone from their weapons and the wounds were restored again.&#xA0;</span><span>The heat from deep inside their body erased their fatigue.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>It wasn&#x2019;t just the expedition members affected, but the other gods fighting the orcs.&#xA0;</span><span>The god of hunting, who had been on the verge of dying from Zankus&#x2019; arrow, ended up vanishing.&#xA0;</span><span>His body recovered and he avoided &#x2018;Death.&#x2019;</span></p><p><i><span>Sasasasak!</span></i></p><p><span>Once again, the beam of light flew towards Zankus.&#xA0;</span><span>Zankus barely avoided it as he muttered.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;That is cheating.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>He didn&#x2019;t know the identity of the old man in the sky, but it was a different influence from the other gods.&#xA0;</span><span>The power of the old man dominated the battlefield. The light kept encouraging the expedition members, interrupting the orcs.</span></p><p><span>Zankus looked around. The situation was starting to tilt. The orcs were dying.&#xA0;</span><span>Kumarak, Anya, Wallachwi etc, were also pushed back. The gods gained strength from the light in the sky.&#xA0;</span><span>Defeat was obvious.&#xA0;</span><span>And defeat meant genocide.&#xA0;</span><span>Zankus&#x2019; face distorted for a moment.</span></p><p><span>Then someone spoke.</span></p><p><span>&#x2018;......&#x2019;</span></p><p><span>Zankus was stunned.&#xA0;</span><span>The voice spoke again.</span></p><p><span>&#x2018;...!&#x2019;</span></p><p><span>Zankus&#x2019; eyes widened.</span></p><p><span>&quot;Kulkulkul...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Zankus started laughing.&#xA0;</span><span>He lifted his bow and loaded an iron arrow on it. Then he pulled back the bowstring and aimed for the sky.&#xA0;</span><span>From far away, a beam of light aimed at Zankus&#x2019; neck.&#xA0;</span><span>It was a stronger power than before.</span></p><p><span>But Zankus didn&#x2019;t care.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;I understand.</span></p><p><span>The light.&#xA0;</span><span>It disappeared before reaching Zankus.&#xA0;</span><span>The rays of light from the old man in the sky also flew towards Zankus. However, they disappeared in front of him, as if they had hit a wall.&#xA0;</span><span>Zankus didn&#x2019;t care about all that.&#xA0;</span><span>He concentrated all the strength of his body to one point. It was the best &#x2018;Death&#x2019; arrow he could do.</span></p><p><span>&quot;Kuoooook...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>His muscles screamed. The overloaded muscle fibers started to break down one by one.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Kuaaaaaaah...!&#x201D;&#xA0;</span><span>Zankus shouted.</span></p><p><span>He squeezed out all the power in his body. It didn&#x2019;t matter if his muscles were breaking. His arms burned. His bowstring was pulled back to the maximum extent possible.&#xA0;</span><span>Just before Zankus and his bow broke...</span></p><p><span>Zankus had a feeling that it was time.</span></p><p><span>&quot;Go.&quot;</span></p><p><span>When the string was released...&#xA0;</span><span>It was like the dew rolling off the leaves.&#xA0;</span><span>Like feathers falling from wings or stamens dangling to the ground.&#xA0;</span><span>The death arrow was launched towards the sky.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Goooooooooo&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>It flew upwards.&#xA0;</span><span>The old man tried to stop the arrow but it flew on, ignoring everything.&#xA0;</span><span>The arrow.&#xA0;</span><span>It passed by the old man.&#xA0;</span><span>It rose to the end of the sky.&#xA0;</span><span>The target at the end.&#xA0;</span><span>The sun that illuminated the world.</span></p><p><span>&#x2018;Sun Killer&#x2019; Zankus.&#xA0;</span><span>His arrow went beyond time and space to penetrate the sun and kill it.&#xA0;</span><span>A black stain appeared in the center of the sun. It spread gradually and the entire sun became black.&#xA0;</span><span>Darkness fell over the world.&#xA0;</span><span>A world where the sun disappeared.&#xA0;</span><span>It was complete darkness.</span></p><p><span>Even &#x2018;Sun Killer&#x2019; Zankus couldn&#x2019;t stop the sun forever. The world would only sink into darkness for a few minutes.&#xA0;</span><span>But that was enough.</span></p><p><span>In the darkness where no one could see, the flapping of wings was heard.&#xA0;</span><span>A man&#x2019;s voice resonated on the battlefield, &#x201C;I am the hawk of the north.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Zankus fell to the ground, no longer having the strength to even lift a finger.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;The blue guardian of the sunrise. The pale blue standard bearer who guides the shamans.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Now it was his turn.&#xA0;</span><span>The orc shaman mentor, the strongest shaman of this age.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Tashaquil.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>A bizarre whisper was heard from underneath the ground.&#xA0;</span><span>With the death of the sun, the hungry demons of hell were being summoned in the darkness.</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p><p><a href="www.wuxiaworld.com">Glossary of Common Korean Terms.</a></p><p>Praise the Orc:&#xA0;<a href="docs.google.com">Glossary Link.&#xA0;</a></p><p>Current schedule:&#xA0;There will now be 14 chapters a week, meaning two chapters every day.</p><p>I have also updated my&#xA0;<a href="www.patreon.com">Patreon</a>&#xA0;to reflect my new novels.
