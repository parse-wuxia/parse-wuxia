<p><span>Chapter 175 - Olympus</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p><p><span>The battle ended with the resistance&#x2019;s victory.</span></p><p><span>The empire failed to win the south, which caused the region to be divided into different areas: the empire&#x2019;s territory and the Free Cities Coalition, including Espada.</span></p><p><span>The emperor remained silent.</span></p><p></p><p style="text-align: center"><span>***</span></p><p></p><p><span>The incident triggered a huge storm in the real world.</span></p><p><span>The fight between Crockta and the imperial army became a hot topic, with the ratings record being broken every day. The videos were replayed during the day and night as they replaced Youvids&#x2019; top hits.</span></p><p><span>In the meantime, Laney, the famous youvidser, released a new video from secretly tracking Crockta. This time, it was a record of his struggles in the south.&#xA0;</span><span>Laney&#x2019;s name was once again stamped onto the minds of the people.</span></p><p><span>Thanks to her, people found out the specific details of what happened.&#xA0;</span><span>These were the contents:</span></p><p><span>After conquering the north, Crockta returned to the continent and headed south.&#xA0;</span><span>He fought bandits and accidentally met a knight of Alaste.&#xA0;</span><span>Vigo&#x2019;s earnest persuasion moved his heart and Crockta&#x2019;s group headed to Alaste.</span></p><p><span>As a city known for its liveliness, Alaste gave him a warm welcome.&#xA0;</span><span>Crockta became friends with the bright and cheerful Alaste people, accepting the request to duel the empire.&#xA0;</span><span>Crockta fought against the genius of the empire, Adandator, and eventually won.</span></p><p><span>Alaste maintained its independence. Crockta became Alaste&#x2019;s savior and there was a feast to rejoice in the victory.</span></p><p><span>He left Alaste with blessings and farewells.&#xA0;</span><span>It seemed like a happy ending.</span></p><p><span>However, the news exploded. After they left for the resort town, the empire broke its promise and destroyed Alaste.&#xA0;</span><span>It was a tragedy.&#xA0;</span><span>Crockta was saddened.&#xA0;</span><span>The empire wanted the entire south to submit, not just Alaste.&#xA0;</span><span>They invaded cities and captured the people, making them soldiers or serfs for the empire. The entire south moaned.</span></p><p><span>Crockta stood up for Alaste&#x2019;s revenge, facing the wicked empire and his own enemies, the Heaven and Earth Clan.</span></p><p><span>The slaughter began.&#xA0;</span><span>He was constantly wielding his sword to save villages, residents, and cities, but he couldn&#x2019;t do enough alone. In the end, most of the south was incorporated into the empire. Crockta left to join Espada&#x2019;s resistance.</span></p><p><span>A frantic struggle followed.&#xA0;</span><span>Along the way, Crockta fought alone until he lost all his comrades. His attempts, while ignoring the risk to his own life, moved the hearts of the viewers. &#xA0;</span><span>The viewers only watched the heavily edited videos of the Heaven and Earth Clan, but through Laney, they were able to see the war from Crockta&#x2019;s viewpoint.</span></p><p><span>Then there was a video of Crockta&#x2019;s &#x2018;final battle.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span>Laney didn&#x2019;t illuminate Crockta alone from the viewpoint of the army. Rather, she should the overwhelming number of troops that Crockta faced from his side. It was a great army that no one dared face alone.</span></p><p><span>In front of them, Crockta emphasized his beliefs and raised the greatsword.&#xA0;</span><span>It was an incomprehensible sight and no one could imagine victory.</span></p><p><span>But he wasn&#x2019;t alone.&#xA0;</span><span>The work he did, the path he took, his accomplishments had turned people into his allies.</span></p><p><span>First of all, Andre appeared. They thought he would attack Crockta, but he broke through the imperial army. People were enthusiastic.&#xA0;</span><span>It was followed by the &#x2018;wine maniac&#x2019; Iron and the role playing group, F4.</span></p><p><span>Then there were those reborn again due to Crockta, the &#x2018;Rehabilitation Brothers. After that was Kenzo and the &#x2018;Mountain of Sabres, Forest of Swords&#x2019; group, wearing red headbands. In addition, Crockta&#x2019;s fanclub &#x2018;He&#x2019;s an Orc, yet still Praiseworthy.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span>Finally, the &#x2018;Orc Users Brotherhood&#x2019; appeared, like a scene from a movie.&#xA0;</span><span>The battle became skewed and they eventually won.&#xA0;</span><span>If Crockta only emphasized the Marxist beliefs, he would&#x2019;ve been scattered as a handful of ashes in this battle. But he practiced his own faith and the reckless fight resulted in his victory.</span></p><p><span>Once the edited video that showed Crockta&#x2019;s struggle was released, his fanclub numbers soared. Now there was no one who didn&#x2019;t know Crockta&#x2019;s name.&#xA0;</span><span>Crockta wasn&apos;t an already dead hero or a media star. He was a living hero who personally proved his path to other people.</span></p><p><span>They all praised Crockta.</span></p><p><span>Opinions differed on how the situation would change in the future. The Elder Lord community was hotter than ever.&#xA0;</span><span>The imperial army retreated and Rommel was captured.&#xA0;</span><span>When looking back on Crockta&#x2019;s actions, Rommel had probably received the Concrete method. Without Rommel, the Heaven and Earth Clan couldn&#x2019;t exert the same power.</span></p><p><span>The users looked forward to what the empire and Heaven and Earth Clan would do in the future.&#xA0;</span><span>But the situation went in an unexpected direction.</span></p><p></p><p style="text-align: center"><span>***</span></p><p></p><p><span>&quot;Ah, Crockta.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;It is Tiyo!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Kyah, so cute!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Can I have a signature?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;NPCs don&#x2019;t know about signatures, fool.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Crockta looks really scary.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>The users started to flock to Espada.&#xA0;</span><span>The number of users in the south was reduced after the empire started their military domination, but as Crockta&#x2019;s popularity peaked, more and more people came to see him.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;It is embarrassing.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Because of my popularity...I&#x2019;m sorry </span><i><span>dot</span></i><span>. Kahahat.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Tiyo laughed in a pleased manner.&#xA0;</span><span>As Crockta&#x2019;s tracks were followed, the cute gnome Tiyo and beautiful dark elf Anor were noticed.&#xA0;</span><span>Inside Crockta&#x2019;s fan club community, &#x2018;He&#x2019;s an Orc, yet still Praiseworthy&#x2019;, there was a small part set aside for Tiyo and Anor.</span></p><p><span>Every time they moved, the users&#x2019; attention was focused on them.</span></p><p><span>&quot;I would be several times more popular if my performance was shown. I missed the opportunity because Crockta acted alone </span><i><span>dot</span></i><span>!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Kulkulkul. I&apos;m sorry.&quot;</span></p><p><span>The residents of Katalu were initially confused as they suddenly received the news that Crockta repelled the imperial army, then they cheered.&#xA0;</span><span>Tiyo and Anor were a bit upset about him leaving silently, but the result was good and everyone was rejoicing.</span></p><p><span>The empire showed no reaction yet. Due to this, the people of Katalu weren&#x2019;t completely satisfied. It was an uneasy peace.&#xA0;</span><span>Still, the mood of the city was much brighter than before. Tiyo waved his hand towards the female fans.</span></p><p><span>&quot;Is that guy doing well </span><i><span>dot</span></i><span>?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;It is enough that he feels bad.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Hrmm. I&#x2019;m curious </span><i><span>dot</span></i><span>.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>They were heading to the prison facility in Katalu&#x2019;s militia barrack.&#xA0;</span><span>There was a person in custody who had decided to help them.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Crockta! You&#x2019;ve come?</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;I am alive. Thank you.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;It is an honor!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>After finishing the war with the empire, Crockta received the respect of the Katalu militia.&#xA0;</span><span>He fought directly on the front lines, so the residents&#x2019; awe towards Crockta increased by several times.</span></p><p><span>&quot;He is having lunch. Do you want to see him?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Of course.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Crockta headed to the prison in the basement.</span></p><p><span>Rommel was there.&#xA0;</span><span>He was sitting at a table inside the prison and eating lunch. He was imprisoned but it was just a gimmick. He wasn&#x2019;t even wearing shackles.&#xA0;</span><span>Officially, he had received the Concrete method in Katalu&#x2019;s prison.&#xA0;</span><span>And unofficially...</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;You were right.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Rommel nodded.&#xA0;</span><span>He tried to negotiate with Crockta by telling him how to end Keynes and Luin.</span></p><p><span>It was all true.&#xA0;</span><span>When he said &#x2018;completely&#x2019;, it wasn&#x2019;t a bluff.&#xA0;</span><span>Keynes and Luin were completely finished.</span></p><p><span>Crockta touched his chin and said skeptically,&#xA0;</span><span>&quot;I don&#x2019;t know about those who have been cursed by the stars but...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>First of all, he kept up the pretense.&#xA0;</span><span>Pretending to be an NPC was getting harder. However, Crockta&#x2019;s name was so well-known then it would be annoying if he exposed himself.&#xA0;</span><span>Tiyo and Anor, as well as his teacher Andre, were the only ones who knew he was cursed by the stars.</span></p><p><span>Crockta continued speaking,&#xA0;</span><span>&#x201C;According to Edgar, they have disappeared from the &#x2018;Abyss of Stars.&#x2019; He confirmed it with Robina. They also picked up the circumstances you described.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;It is all true. As your friends from the Rehabilitation Brothers said, they will disappear forever from this world.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Edgar.&#xA0;</span><span>The head of the Heaven and Earth branch in Maillard.</span></p><p><span>He was originally part of the Rehabilitation Brothers and joined Heaven and Earth after breaking up with Robina. A man who decided to accept Crockta as his brother after drinking together in Maillard.</span></p><p><span>He knew Crockta&#x2019;s identity and betrayed him, but Crockta didn&#x2019;t hate him.&#xA0;</span><span>He ended the connection by killing himself and warned Crockta to watch out for the Heaven and Earth Clan.&#xA0;</span><span>At that time, he refused to make any excuses to Crockta. </span></p><p><span>&quot;We have strict rules in the &#x2018;Abyss of Stars.&#x2019; They have committed a serious crime.&#x201D; Rommel explained.</span></p><p><span>Crockta had heard about the Elder Lord doping from Ji Hayeon.</span></p><p><span>The Heaven and Earth Clan was doing it.</span></p><p><span>They put drugs into people, turning them semi-comatose and then connected them to Elder Lord through illegally modified capsules. The victims were injected with nutrients and forced to play Elder Lord.</span></p><p><span>They were able to maintain a high rate of assimilation due to the effect of the drugs. Because they couldn&#x2019;t terminate their connection, they worked endlessly in Elder Lord.&#xA0;</span><span>The Heaven and Earth Clan made them subservient in such a way. Then the clan grew quickly due to the high assimilation rate of the clan members.</span></p><p><span>Keynes and Luin did this secretly so Rommel hadn&#x2019;t known about it. However, Rommel had guessed and was convinced about the situation by Edgar not long ago.</span></p><p><span>This was their weakness, Rommel explained.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;......&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Crockta heard about their atrocities and evaluated them again. They weren&#x2019;t clever game players. They were real garbage.&#xA0;</span><span>Rommel misunderstood the strange expression Crockta was making and added.</span></p><p><span>&quot;You don&#x2019;t have to be disappointed about them being eliminated so easily. The punishment from the &#x2018;Abyss of Stars&#x2019; is more painful than anything you can do to them.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;I see.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;They will lose everything.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span><span>Rommel said while calmly drinking his tea.</span></p><p><span>It was like he said.&#xA0;</span><span>It was the punishment from reality, not Elder Lord. They would be put in prison and have their assets confiscated.</span></p><p><span>&quot;Putting your old colleagues in hell, you aren&#x2019;t a normal human being.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Huhuhu.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Rommel laughed. When Crockta asked about why Rommel changed his mind, he replied,</span></p><p><span>&apos;Just, I don&#x2019;t want to be hurt.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span>Rommel wasn&#x2019;t playing Elder Lord due to the money paid to him, unlike the others in the Heaven and Earth Clan.&#xA0;</span><span>Rommel the &#x2018;War Maestro&#x2019;, he enjoyed playing Elder Lord itself.&#xA0;</span><span>He was in the Heaven and Earth Clan because it guaranteed him the position of commander, not because of anything else. Keynes and Luin weren&#x2019;t worth more than that to him.</span></p><p><span>&quot;It isn&#x2019;t normal. I heard that a lot. But...&#x201D;&#xA0;</span><span>Rommel grinned.&#xA0;</span><span>&quot;Looking back now, I think I was secretly angered by what they were doing. I am also an ordinary human. They have sinned, so they should pay the price.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Maybe this cold looking guy had sobered up when he was hit by Crockta&#x2019;s punch.&#xA0;</span><span>The moment that Crockta was going to leave the prison... Rommel called out.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Crockta.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;What is it?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;You have a lot of friends. Warriors, necromancer and several humans...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;There are a lot.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;So...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;So?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Rommel hesitated for a moment and sighed.&#xA0;</span><span>Then he opened his mouth again.&#xA0;</span><span>&#x201C;Can I also be your friend?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Crockta&#x2019;s expression became strange.&#xA0;</span><span>He didn&#x2019;t have any good feelings towards Rommel, as Rommel had destroyed Alaste and harassed the south.&#xA0;</span><span>However, Rommel was an ordinary user who didn&#x2019;t know this world was another dimension.&#xA0;</span><span>For him, killing people was just part of the gameplay. He just played as a villain.</span></p><p><span>Crockta&#x2019;s mind became complicated. </span><span>Crockta asked, &#x201C;Why are you saying this all of a sudden?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;I just admire you.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span><span>Rommel raised his teacup to his mouth again. However, he realized that he already drank all the tea and put down the cup.&#xA0;</span><span>&quot;I was once an enemy but I would like to continue to know you...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Pff. This sounds like a love confession </span><i><span>dot</span></i><span>.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span><span>Tiyo interrupted from where he stood.&#xA0;</span><span>&#x201C;It is funny but just nonsense</span><i><span> dot</span></i><span>. You only cooperated for a short time, yet you want to be friends with Crockta after killing innocent people? Hell no.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>His words were decisive.&#xA0;</span><span>Rommel nodded. He knew that he was an unforgivable villain from the NPCs&#x2019; point of view.</span></p><p><span>Tiyo added,&#xA0;</span><span>&quot;If you want to be friends with Crockta, you should show it in your behavior </span><i><span>dot</span></i><span>.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Behavior...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;People are evaluated by their actions </span><i><span>dot</span></i><span>. You can never be close friends with Crockta using meaningless words. If you really have a change of heart, you need to prove it.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Crockta nodded in agreement. Tiyo&#x2019;s words represented his heart.</span></p><p><span>&quot;It is like Tiyo said.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Look, I can tell Crockta&#x2019;s heart without needing any words </span><i><span>dot</span></i><span>! This degree is needed to be his friend.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Tiyo raised his shoulders. Rommel laughed.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;I see. I understand. See you next time.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Crockta and Tiyo left the prison.&#xA0;</span><span>Rommel decided to stay here until the Heaven and Earth Clan were destroyed. It would be a while.</span></p><p><span>Crockta and Tiyo left the prison.&#xA0;</span><span>Their work was completed.</span></p><p><span>This time, it seemed like they could travel leisurely.</span></p><p></p><p style="text-align: center"><span>***</span></p><p></p><p><span>There were voices.</span></p><p><span>&#x2018;It was definitely her. She showed up. Death is back.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span>&#x2018;I&#x2019;ll find her. i will find and stop her. Do whatever it takes.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span>&apos;It wasn&#x2019;t an error? Was she alive?&#x2019;</span></p><p><span>&#x2018;We need to stop her. For the sake of the world.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span>&#x2018;What does she want?&#x2019;</span></p><p><span>&#x2018;The destruction of the world.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span>&#x2018;The destruction of the world.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span>&#x2018;The destruction of the world.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span>&apos;How do we stop it? I can hardly see her. It is suspicious. Is it really her?&#x2019;</span></p><p><span>&#x2018;That guy, the orc who conquered the north. It is him. It is obvious.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span>&apos;Is he related?&#x2019;</span></p><p><span>&#x2018;I understand. Orc! The orcs! She is going to use the orcs. This time, the orcs!&#x2019;</span></p><p><span>&#x2018;It still isn&#x2019;t certain. Orcs don&#x2019;t believe in anyone. We can&#x2019;t jump to conclusions.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span>&apos;They are orcs. The only thing they believe in is the forgotten god. No one protects them, so she probably reached out.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span>&#x2018;Really, the orcs?&#x2019;</span></p><p><span>&#x2018;Orcs.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span>&#x2018;Orc.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span>&#x2018;Orc.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span>&#x2018;Orc.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span>&#x2018;The orcs.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span>&#x2018;They are people we can&#x2019;t manage anyway.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span>&#x2018;It doesn&#x2019;t matter even if they disappear.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span>&#x2018;No one will trust those cheeky brats.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span>&#x2018;&apos;The orcs.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span>&#x2018;The orcs and Crockta.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span>&#x2018;Cheeky brats.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span>The voices expressed their opinions.</span></p><p><span>&#x2018;No.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span>&#x2018;Get rid of them, get rid of her.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span>&#x2018;Protect the world.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span>&#x2018;Our world.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span>&#x2018;For the world.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span>That day.&#xA0;</span><span>A divine message was sent down again.</span></p><p><span>Every god whispered the same thing.</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p><p><a href="www.wuxiaworld.com">Glossary of Common Korean Terms.</a></p><p>Praise the Orc:&#xA0;<a href="docs.google.com">Glossary Link.&#xA0;</a></p><p>Current schedule:&#xA0;There will now be 14 chapters a week, meaning two chapters every day.</p><p>I have also updated my&#xA0;<a href="www.patreon.com">Patreon</a>&#xA0;to reflect my new novels.
