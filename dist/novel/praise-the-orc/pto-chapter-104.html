<p><span>Chapter 104 - Spinoa (2)</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p><p><span>Crockta&#x2019;s eyes widened as he found the white branch-like pattern on the forehead. But it slowly disappeared.&#xA0;</span><span>Crockta examined the face again but the white pattern didn&#x2019;t appear anymore.</span></p><p><span>Tiyo and Anor didn&#x2019;t show any signs of agitation. They didn&#x2019;t seem to have seen the pattern.&#xA0;</span><span>What was it?</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Please follow me.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Crockta&#x2019;s group followed the messenger. The guard who guided the party spoke from behind.&#xA0;</span><span>&#x201C;Leave your caruks to us.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Thank you.&quot;</span></p><p><span>As Crockta&#x2019;s group walked out of the guards&#x2019; office, a carriage could be seen. However, it was driven by caruks instead of horses.&#xA0;</span><span>The messenger led them towards it. Crockta and his companions climbed on.</span></p><p><span>The caruks moved.&#xA0;</span><span>The messenger was silent.</span></p><p><span>Crockta spoke first, &quot;What did he call us for?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>The messenger sitting across from Crockta looked at him with an indifferent look as he answered, &#x201C;Zelkian will explain directly.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Crockta looked at his forehead but the white branch that he previously saw wasn&#x2019;t there.&#xA0;</span><span>The conversation didn&#x2019;t continue so Crockta observed the landscape of Spinoa.</span></p><p><span>The streets of Spino were similar to those in Arnin, and didn&#x2019;t show any signs of imminent war. Merchants were buying and selling goods while lovers tenderly walked down the road. Sometimes he saw children running around in groups.</span></p><p><span>But that thought changed as they headed deeper inside.</span></p><p><span>Lightly armed dark elves were experiencing tactical training.</span></p><p><span>At the training grounds, arrows were constantly flying towards targets while elsewhere, dark elves with shields and swords were practicing. Like gladiators in an area, those competing in a one-on-one match could be seen.</span></p><p><span>It was an army.</span></p><p><span>&quot;They are better than any dark elves I&#x2019;ve seen dot,&#x201D; admired Tiyo.</span></p><p><span>As he said, their skills were above any other garrison they had ever seen. All of them were training seriously with determined faces.&#xA0;</span><span>They were the faces of those who knew they might die soon and were committed to killing.</span></p><p><span>The messenger still didn&#x2019;t say anything.&#xA0;</span><span>Crockta looked at his face and their eyes suddenly met.&#xA0;</span><span>He silently stared at Crockta, who didn&#x2019;t avoid his gaze.</span></p><p><span>The messenger finally opened his mouth to ask, &quot;Who is the strongest enemy that you have ever fought?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Crockta carefully thought about the answer.&#xA0;</span><span>He had suffered in many battles, but choosing one enemy out of them all as the strongest wasn&#x2019;t easy.&#xA0;</span><span>Gushantimur popped up but he wasn&#x2019;t an enemy. If it was an enemy who he fought on the threshold of life and death...</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Behemoth.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>The fight at that time had been terrible.&#xA0;</span><span>He thought he would die several times. If the Demon&#x2019;s Mouth hadn&#x2019;t swallowed the unidentified remains, the behemoth would&#x2019;ve regenerated infinitely and eventually kill him.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Behemoth.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>The messenger nodded as if he knew the beast.</span></p><p><span>&quot;Have you see it?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;No.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;How...?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>It was a monster below the border.&#xA0;</span><span>The messenger didn&#x2019;t answer the question but instead spoke about something else.</span></p><p><span>&quot;In the future, the fight will be much stronger than that.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;......!&quot;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Please accept my prayers.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Then he fell silent again.</span></p><p><span>There was only one enemy he had to fight in the future.&#xA0;</span><span>The orc chieftain, Calmahart.</span></p><p><span>He was a hurdle that Crockta had to overcome.&#xA0;</span><span>A monster with a huge body that seemed to be different from normal orcs.&#xA0;</span><span>Every time he wielded an axe, the enemy was torn in two. When he roared, the nearby enemies would have their ears burst. He was known as a mutant orc that had never existed in history before.</span></p><p><span>But even so, for him to be stronger than the behemoth?</span></p><p><span>Crockta touched Ogre Slayer on his back.</span></p><p></p><p style="text-align: center"><span>***</span></p><p></p><p><span>&#x201C;We&apos;ve arrived.&quot;</span></p><p><span>Outside the carriage window, the figure of the world tree could be seen.&#xA0;</span><span>The translucent leaves that occasionally fell down were solid but scattered a faint light.</span></p><p><span>Anor spoke in a dreamy tone, &quot;Beautiful.&quot;</span></p><p><span>The caruks stopped and the group descended from the carriage.&#xA0;</span><span>The roots of the world tree were exposed. There was an opening between the roots.&#xA0;</span><span>It looked like an entrance.</span></p><p><span>The messenger pointed and said, &quot;Over there.&quot;</span></p><p><span>It led inside the world tree.&#xA0;</span><span>Crockta&#x2019;s group followed.&#xA0;</span><span>The interior was surprisingly bright. Crockta looked around. There was no specific light source, but the inside was bright like there were light bulbs.</span></p><p><span>Crockta placed his fingers on the wall.&#xA0;</span><span>It was a rough bark texture.&#xA0;</span><span>Then light leaked faintly from it.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Um...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>The world tree itself emitted a dim light that illuminated the inside.&#xA0;</span><span>It truly was a mysterious tree.&#xA0;</span><span>As they entered a little inside, guards stopped them. The guards identified the messenger and stepped out of the way.</span></p><p><span>Their eyes moved over Crockta&#x2019;s group.&#xA0;</span><span>&#x201C;Enter.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>The guards opened the door without any special procedures.&#xA0;</span><span>Then the inside of the world tree was revealed.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;It is unbelievable.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Wow...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>It was the appearance of a building they never imagined would be present inside the tree.&#xA0;</span><span>There was a big lobby when they entered. In the center of the lobby was a beautifully decorated staircase that went up and corridors leading to the left and right.&#xA0;</span><span>There were doors all over the place and passing dark elves bowed to them.&#xA0;</span><span>It was inside the world tree so the walls were covered in the distinctive translucent green leaves.</span></p><p><span>&quot;How did you do this?&#x201D; Crockta asked.</span></p><p><span>This was impossible in the modern world where he lived.</span></p><p><span>&quot;We didn&#x2019;t do anything.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span><span>The messenger smiled. It was the first time seeing that expression on his face.&#xA0;</span><span>&quot;The world tree made this for us and we are just staying in it for a while.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Based on the explanation, it wasn&#x2019;t made artificially but the world tree had willingly done it for them.</span></p><p><span>Crockta felt his heart pounding.&#xA0;</span><span>The world of Elder Lord was really mysterious.</span></p><p><span>&quot;Zelkian is at the top. Let&#x2019;s go.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>They climbed the spiral staircase made of wood. The landscape changed little by little every time they climbed a floor.&#xA0;</span><span>After a long time, the stairs finally ended.&#xA0;</span><span>There was no place to go up anymore but there was no floor to step on. The stairs literally ended in thin air.&#xA0;</span><span>The interior of the world tree was empty, and there was a huge void above their head.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;This place?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Tiyo looked down at the breathtaking view before tightly holding onto the stairs. He seemed to be afraid of heights.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Wait a minute.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Anor was confused by the words.&#xA0;</span><span>They soon understood what the messenger meant.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Ah...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>A big branch was descending towards the end of the stairs.</span></p><p><span>It was large and flat enough for many people to stand on it. There were twigs and leaves hanging from it, and it shook like a living creature as it touched the end of the stairs. The messenger jumped on top of it then Crockta&#x2019;s group boarded in turn.</span></p><p><span> The branch slowly started to rise.</span></p><p><span>&quot;How wonderful...&#x201D; Tiyo muttered blankly.</span></p><p><span>This was possible due to the abilities of the world tree.&#xA0;</span><span>The branch rose for a while before stopping. The gazes of Crockta&#x2019;s party turned to one side.&#xA0;</span><span>There was a passage leading outside. The branch led them towards it.&#xA0;</span><span>The group followed the messenger and went outside the world tree.</span></p><p><span>Then they became flustered.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Wah...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Oh my god.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Wow...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>The sunset was right in front of them.&#xA0;</span><span>Everything from the sunset to the rest of the world spread out before their eyes.&#xA0;</span><span>The plains and mountains in the distance, the animals on the small hills, Spinoa and the elves. The landscape of the world looked like small toys.&#xA0;</span><span>The blazing red sunset cast long shadows on the earth and all the beings of the world seemed to be gazing at the sunset with them.</span></p><p><span>It was a beautiful scenery that couldn&#x2019;t be imagined.&#xA0;</span><span>Crockta&#x2019;s party forgot themselves for a while as they admired the scenery.</span></p><p><span>Then a voice was heard, &#x201C;Welcome.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Crockta&#x2019;s group turned towards the voice. They were on a branch of the world tree so movement was inconvenient.&#xA0;</span><span>Crockta lowered his center of gravity and looked around. Tiyo quietly grabbed Crockta&#x2019;s clothing. It was clear that he was suffering from a fear of heights.</span></p><p><span>The owner of the voice couldn&#x2019;t be seen.</span></p><p><span>At that moment.&#xA0;</span><span>&quot;This way!&quot;</span></p><p><span>Below.</span></p><p><span>Crockta looked down.&#xA0;</span><span>Then he became flustered again.</span></p><p><span>&quot;...What <em>dot</em>?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>A dark elf.&#xA0;</span><span>He was climbing up the world tree.</span></p><p><i><span>Kwajik!</span></i></p><p><span>The small pickaxe in his hand pierced the surface of the world tree.&#xA0;</span><span>He relied on it to climb up and patted the bark of the world tree. As his footing stabilized, he used the pickaxe and climbed up again.</span></p><p><i><span>Kwajik!</span></i></p><p><span>The bark of the world tree was pierced.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;......&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>He climbed up the world tree and reached the branch where they were located.&#xA0;</span><span>He sat down and wiped the sweat from his brow.</span></p><p><span>The messenger just closed his eyes like this was a natural sight.</span></p><p><span>Once the sweat was wiped up, he stood up and proclaimed, &#x201C;I am Zelkian! I am the leader who leads the dark elves and he who communicates with the world tree!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;......&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;......&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Crockta&#x2019;s party was speechless.</span></p><p><span>The leader of the dark elves, they expected him to be more like a dark elf than anyone else. They imagined a slim body with a calm attitude and wise eyes.&#xA0;</span><span>But this man was very big.&#xA0;</span><span>The burly Radet couldn&#x2019;t even be compared to him.</span></p><p><span>It couldn&#x2019;t be compared to Crockta but the muscles were more like a human than a dark elf.&#xA0;</span><span>In addition, he was a dark elf whose hobby was climbing up the world tree!</span></p><p><span>&quot;Climbing is truly the best exercise. It is a great thrill.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span><span>Zelkian shrugged like he misunderstood their expressions.&#xA0;</span><span>&quot;I am a true climber who will climb to the end of the world tree.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;...Doesn&#x2019;t that damage it?&#x201D; Crockta asked.</span></p><p><span>&quot;No, no. The world tree isn&#x2019;t so stingy. As long as it is given water and sunshine, the wounds will recover...ouch!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>One of the branches of the world tree descended and hit his back.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;......&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>It was a really bizarre sight.&#xA0;</span><span>Zelkian was embarrassed about being hit and grumbled towards the world tree. Then another branch shook from behind him.&#xA0;</span><span>He freaked out and ducked.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;S-Stop! You are really violent.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>The branch slid back at his shout and he turned around again.&#xA0;</span><span>He didn&#x2019;t say it but they seemed to hear a voice crying out &#x2018;there is no need to shout!&#x2019;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;At any rate, welcome. Crockta! I really wanted to see you!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Zelkian approached and hugged Crockta.&#xA0;</span><span>Crockta could smell the sweat on him but refrained from saying anything.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Wow, look at these muscles. Muscles. Crazy. Hey Jenadu, come and touch. Hey, Jenadu.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Zelkian turned around while still hugging Crockta. He called out the name of the apostle who led Crockta&#x2019;s group.</span></p><p><span>&quot;Does Crockta exercise a lot? How many kilograms? Do you eat chicken breast after exercising? Do you receive any separate buffs?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;......&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Is it in your genes? Oh, you won&#x2019;t grow any bigger than this, right? The calves won&#x2019;t grow anymore even if you exercise.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Jenadu approached silently and pulled Zelkian. He was taken away.&#xA0;</span><span>&#x201C;Zelkian. Get to why you called them.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Ah. Yes.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span><span>Zelkian&#x2019;s gaze became serious.</span></p><p><span>Now it seemed like the real conversation. Crockta&#x2019;s group straightened their postures.&#xA0;</span><span>They were enjoying a leisurely moment right now, but a great war was occurring in the north.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Crockta.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Speak.&quot;</span></p><p><span>Zelkian hesitated and opened his mouth, &quot;Don&#x2019;t you think it is a foul to enhance your body with buffs?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>The branch of the world tree appeared again to hit his back.</span></p><p><span>&quot;Ah, it was just a joke.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>He scratched his head. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span>Then he looked again at Crockta, Tiyo, and Anor and said, &quot;Crockta. Tiyo. Anor. I heard so much about you. People who came from the continent, possibly the ones who opened up the border. Heroes. As far as I can see, you are against the Great Clan.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Crockta nodded. Zelkian folded his arms.</span></p><p><span>&quot;You are strong enough. But... you need to become stronger in order to fight against the Great Clan in the future.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Is he that strong?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;You can&#x2019;t win against the great chieftain with just strength.</span></p><p><span>The branches of the world tree moved next to Zelkian.&#xA0;</span><span>Zelkian looked at it for a moment like he was sympathetic. It was a way of exchanging words without any sound.</span></p><p><span>Zelkian nodded.&#xA0;</span><span>&quot;Crockta. And to the other two as well, the world tree wants to say this.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Zelkian&#x2019;s expression was serious.&#xA0;</span><span>He stopped before delivering the message to Crockta and winked at the world tree.&#xA0;</span><span>The branches of the world tree waved. It seemed like a signal to continue.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Hoo...okay. It can&#x2019;t be helped this time. I understand. It is inevitable.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>He scratched his head with a bittersweet expression before pointing to the world tree.</span></p><p><span>&quot;This guy told me to say this.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Then he pointed towards Crockta and shouted, &#x201C;You, become my apostle!&#x201D;</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p><p><a href="www.wuxiaworld.com">Glossary of Common Korean Terms.</a></p><p>Praise the Orc:&#xA0;<a href="docs.google.com">Glossary Link.&#xA0;</a></p><p>Current schedule:&#xA0;<strong>Next Patreon goal has been reached!!
