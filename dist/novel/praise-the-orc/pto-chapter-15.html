<p><span>Chapter 15 - About Life (2)</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p><p><span>The residents fled after seeing Derek. Everyone knew Derek, the notorious loan shark who dominated Anail&#x2019;s back alleys.</span></p><p><span>Ian looked around.&#xA0;</span><span>There didn&#x2019;t seem to be any escape path for him to take. Derek&#x2019;s men formed a circle around Ian to prevent him from fleeing.</span></p><p><span>What should he do? Ian&#x2019;s eyes sunk.</span></p><p><span>Derek and his five people. Not only that, but Derek was much stronger than the rest of his people.&#xA0;</span><span>It was best not to fight.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Derek, it&#x2019;s best that you don&#x2019;t fight me.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Why do you think that?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Do you have the confidence to stop Hoyt&#x2019;s anger?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>He mentioned Hoyt.&#xA0;</span><span>Derek&#x2019;s failure to harm the Thompson family was entirely due to Hoyt.&#xA0;</span><span>However, unlike his expectations, Derek smiled quietly.</span></p><p><span>Ian became uncomfortable. Derek&#x2019;s smile and laid back behaviour was the exact opposite of what he imagined. Ian expected him to be a sleazy money lender, but Derek was much bigger than that. His strength was like a warrior, exuding a sharp atmosphere that Ian had never felt before.</span></p><p><span>Ian realized that the situation was going out of control. Now he had to gamble.</span></p><p><span>Derek raised his sword.</span></p><p><span>&quot;You won&#x2019;t be going alone, so don&#x2019;t worry.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>He laughed and imitated Ian&#x2019;s words.</span></p><p><span>&quot;Young Man, it would be best if you didn&#x2019;t fight back.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Ian could feel Ray&#x2019;s hands trembling at his waist.&#xA0;</span><span>Ian tried to get help from Stella, whom he met in Anail, but she wasn&#x2019;t connected.</span></p><p><span>It was a dilemma. Ian also raised his greatsword.&#xA0;</span><span>The important thing was Ray. For his survival, Ian had to retreat.</span></p><p><span>Ian whispered to Ray, &quot;Hold on tightly to my neck.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Huh...?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Ian lifted Ray up and placed him on his back. Ray reflexively grabbed his neck as Ian rushed backwards.&#xA0;</span><span>It was in the opposite direction of Derek. The subordinates gathered in the direction of Ian&#x2019;s escape. He needed to defeat the one in front of him before they all gathered.</span></p><p><span>However, the underling was different from the user hunters that Ian had overpowered. He calmly swung his sword and slowed Ian down. As Ian stopped, the other underlings caught up.&#xA0;</span><span>Ian was once again surrounded and the siege was narrowed further.</span></p><p><span>Beyond them, Derek was approaching.&#xA0;</span><span>&quot;Even if you struggle, the result is the same.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;......&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Ian decided to buy some time.</span></p><p><span>&quot;No matter how dirty a loan shark is, you shouldn&#x2019;t act unfairly.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Unfairly...?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Yes, Derek. Let&apos;s have a fair 1 on 1 fight,&#x201D; Ian said.</span></p><p><span>Derek burst out laughing.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Puhahaha. What are you saying, Orc?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Derek is a thoroughly practical person. Do you think that I would speak nonsense?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Have a 1 on 1 with your friends in heaven. Kilkil.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Derek&#x2019;s mouth rose.</span></p><p><span>&quot;...Hrmm.&quot;</span></p><p><span>Ian ignored the underlings and told Derek.</span></p><p><span>&quot;Surely you aren&#x2019;t scared of a 1 on 1 fight?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;What an interesting friend.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Ian didn&#x2019;t expect him to agree to the blatant provocation, but Derek abruptly nodded.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Okay.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>His subordinates&#x2019; eyes widened.</span></p><p><span>&quot;Boss...?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Why, do you have no confidence?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Me?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Yes.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Derek placed a knife at the neck of an underling and said,&#xA0;</span><span>&quot;Surely Derek&#x2019;s men aren&#x2019;t afraid of an orc...?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Ah, no!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;So fight him. Alone.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Yes, yep!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Derek&#x2019;s subordinate vigorously nodded his head and pulled out his sword as he stepped forward.&#xA0;</span><span>Ian put Ray down while ignoring the ominous feeling in the back of his mind.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Ray, stay back. If there is a gap, then run away.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Mister...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Don&#x2019;t worry. Don&#x2019;t you believe in an orc warrior?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Ian laughed. Ray&#x2019;s face became tearful.&#xA0;</span><span>It was a familiar scene.</span></p><p><span>&#x2018;Ray, don&#x2019;t you believe in Father?&#x2019;</span></p><p><span>His father Thompson had left after saying the same remark as Ian. He still hadn&#x2019;t come back.&#xA0;</span><span>Ray wanted to hold onto Ian, but he was already moving forward and pointing at Derek&#x2019;s subordinate with his sword.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Mister...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>The battle began.&#xA0;</span><span>Ian came out first. He tried to draw the opponent to his side, but the person stepped back because he felt the incredible atmosphere of Orc&apos;s Superhuman Strength.</span></p><p><span>This was fortunate for Ian.&#xA0;</span><span>Ian just wanted to buy some time.&#xA0;</span><span>Eventually, Hoyt would hear about this and come running.&#xA0;</span><span>Ian moved forward with no substance in his attacks. The opponent kept avoiding. Derek&#x2019;s expression hardened as he saw both of them.</span></p><p><span>&quot;How boring,&#x201D; Derek muttered.</span></p><p><span>Then the expression on the face of the underling changed.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Uhh...Uaaaah!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>The opponent rushed at Ian, who stepped back to avoid the incoming attacks.&#xA0;</span><span>The attacker and defender had changed, but the battle was a repetition of the previous one.</span></p><p><span>Derek burst out laughing.</span></p><p><span>&quot;Young orc.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;......&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;I know your intentions, but you should also pay attention to me.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Derek gestured with his chin.&#xA0;</span><span>Derek&#x2019;s subordinates once again raised their weapons.</span></p><p><span>&quot;If you don&#x2019;t properly entertain me, then this will be over.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Ian took a deep breath.&#xA0;</span><span>His choices had disappeared.&#xA0;</span><span>There was only one road remaining now. He had no other choice but to commit to a last hurrah on this path.</span></p><p><span>Ian&apos;s muscles swelled up.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Bul&#x2019;tar&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Ian charged towards the opponent.&#xA0;</span><span>His greatsword descended with force towards the opponent&#x2019;s weapon who twisted his body to avoid it. Ian pursued him and slashed him.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Kuok!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>His opponent blocked it. The two blades faced each other and it became a battle of strength.&#xA0;</span><span>Ian put pressure on the opponent. The other person kicked Ian in the abdomen.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Huuk!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Die, orc bastard!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>The underling stabbed at his neck. Ian quickly ducked and rolled across the ground to avoid it.&#xA0;</span><span>The sword missed.&#xA0;</span><span>Again, the sword descended towards the body of Ian, who had fallen. Ian could barely escape by rolling to left and right.</span></p><p><span>He gritted his teeth.</span></p><p><span>&quot;Horyaaaaah!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Ian stood up and charged again. His opponent aimed the blade, but Ian didn&#x2019;t care. He pushed ahead and slashed the opponent with his sword, despite the blade aiming at him. The opponent fell to the floor.</span></p><p><span>Ian got on top of him, but there was still the blade between them.&#xA0;</span><span>Ian paused for a short moment.&#xA0;</span><span>He wielded his fist before he lost his spirit.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Waaaah!&quot;</span></p><p><span>The orc&#x2019;s fist struck the underling&#x2019;s face.</span></p><p><i><span>Peeok!</span></i> <i><span>Peeok!</span></i> <i><span>Peeok!</span></i></p><p><span>Ian&#x2019;s punches turned the subordinate&#x2019;s face into a rice cake. Ian&#x2019;s hand stopped as he recovered his spirit.</span></p><p><span>There was a blade at Ian&#x2019;s neck.&#xA0;</span><span>It was another of Derek&#x2019;s subordinates.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Stop. You can&#x2019;t kill any of my men.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Ian stood up with a wince.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Is he alive?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Yes, he is still breathing.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Foolish guy.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Derek placed his foot on the head of the collapsed underling.</span></p><p><span>&quot;Losing to an inexperienced orc...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Ian stepped back and picked up his sword. There were still four subordinates remaining.&#xA0;</span><span>Ian asked with a grin.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Who&#x2019;s next?&#x201D;</span></p><p></p><p style="text-align: center"><span>***</span></p><p></p><p><span>He breathed out.&#xA0;</span><span>His body was a wreck.</span></p><p><span>[Orc&#x2019;s Vitality (Uncommon) is being used.]</span></p><p><span>[The bleeding is severe. Please seek medical attention.]</span></p><p><span>[Your right arm won&#x2019;t move. Your actions are constrained.]</span></p><p><span>The third subordinate was lying down with a pierced abdomen.&#xA0;</span><span>Now there were only two left, excluding Derek.</span></p><p><span>Ian&#x2019;s head drooped against his will. He wanted to collapse. He wanted to rest. It would be comfortable if he died. After all, this was just a game.&#xA0;</span><span>However,he had to protect Ray.</span></p><p><span>It may have been a game to him, but this was reality for Ray, an NPC with an artificial intelligence.&#xA0;</span><span>Right now, the life of an NPC was depending on him.</span></p><p><span>Ian laughed.&#xA0;</span><span>Lenox&#x2019;s voice rang in his ears.</span></p><p><span>&apos;Raise your head! Everything is hard! Don&#x2019;t relax! It is hard! So what? Nobody cares!&#x2019;</span></p><p><span>Those words.&#xA0;</span><span>The enemy wouldn&#x2019;t care about his circumstances.&#xA0;</span><span>The enemy didn&#x2019;t care that he wanted to close his eyes and collapse. No, they would gain strength from Ian&#x2019;s despair, and would try to step on him.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Who&#x2019;s next?&#x201D; Ian shouted.</span></p><p><span>The residents were already watching the fight through the windows and gaps in the alleys. An orc struggling against the infamous Derek. The orc shed blood, but didn&#x2019;t give up.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Come! I will deal with you!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Impressive.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Derek nodded.</span></p><p><span>&quot;Yes, you... you truly are Hoyt&#x2019;s friend. I believe it.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Derek, will you come out?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;The entertainment is over, Young Man.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;What do you mean?&quot;</span></p><p><span>&quot;I enjoyed it, but now it is time to work.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Derek gestured with his chin. Then his subordinate, hovering behind Ian, grabbed Ray.&#xA0;</span><span>Ray struggled desperately, but he couldn&#x2019;t resist the strength of an adult.&#xA0;</span><span>Ian tried to rush over, but Derek approached and punched Ian in the abdomen.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Cough...!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Derek was strong.&#xA0;</span><span>It was a blow that made his head go blank.</span></p><p><span>Ian sat down. Derek spoke in a laughing tone from above him.</span></p><p><span>&quot;The time is coming soon.&quot;</span></p><p><span>Derek grabbed Ian&#x2019;s hair.&#xA0;</span><span>Then someone caught Ian&#x2019;s attention.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>An orc was running over.&#xA0;</span><span>One eye, and a scary face laced with scars and covered in tattoos.&#xA0;</span><span>It was Hoyt.</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p><p><a href="www.wuxiaworld.com">Glossary of Common Korean Terms.</a></p><p>Praise the Orc:&#xA0;<a href="docs.google.com">Glossary Link.&#xA0;</a></p><p>Current schedule: &#xA0;Next Patreon goal reached!!
