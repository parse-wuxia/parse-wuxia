<p><span>Chapter 112 - Great Northern War (8)</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p><p><span>In the darkness, something fluttered.&#xA0;</span><span>His past days fluttered by.</span></p><p><span>From that time onwards, which could be called the start.</span></p><p><span>&#x2018;You must protect your little sister.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span>&#x2018;A brother and sister should have a closer relationship with each other than that with their parents. You have to depend on each other until you die. It is the deepest family connection. So...&#x2019;</span></p><p><span>&#x2018;You must protect Yiyu.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span>&#x2018;I believe in you.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span>His father&#x2019;s voice, which could no longer be heard, passed through his ears.&#xA0;</span><span>From then on, his sister had always remained a small child, clutching onto his clothing from behind him.</span></p><p><span>Jung Yiyu, she spoke.&#xA0;</span><span>He remembered when she hung onto his every word as a child.</span></p><p><span>&apos;I will leave it to you.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span>&apos;You&#x2019;ll be an adult soon.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span>Who said that? Was it one of his relatives whom he didn&#x2019;t see anymore? It was his uncle who couldn&#x2019;t take Yiyu, his aunt who demanded money for Yiyu&#x2019;s living expenses.</span></p><p><span>&#x2018;Your mission.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span>&#x2018;Defend it.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span>&apos;Even if you have to sacrifice your life.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span>After joining the special forces, Ian&#x2019;s first mission was to protect a civilian on the battlefield.&#xA0;</span><span>The civilian&#x2019;s identity was still unknown. He just remembered that the person didn&#x2019;t fit the battlefield.&#xA0;</span><span>The eyes from back then gazed at him with a glassy look. His body trembled in fear and he could only rely on Ian. He embraced Ian and cried while thanking him.</span></p><p><span>&#x2018;Please, Ian.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span>&apos;Defend it, Raven.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span>&#x2018;Crockta!&#x2019;</span></p><p><span>It had always been like this. Ian, Raven, and then Crockta.&#xA0;</span><span>People were always staring at him.&#xA0;</span><span>Those countless gazes.&#xA0;</span><span>No one would think it was good the moment he collapsed.</span></p><p><span>&#x2018;Crockta.&#x2019;&#xA0;</span><span>Someone called him, </span><span>&#x2018;Crockta.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span>He raised his gaze.&#xA0;</span><span>There were eyes staring at him in the darkness.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;You.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>He knew this face.&#xA0;</span><span>He was no longer a person.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Blackmore.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>He laughed and then pointed behind him.&#xA0;</span><span>The darkness lifted and the landscape of Chesswood was unfolded. The shattered villages were being rebuilt.&#xA0;</span><span>Ingram was visible. He moved with the villagers, and with the uers as well.&#xA0;</span><span>NPCs, no, residents of Elder Lord and the users of Earth were raising the village together.</span></p><p><span>Blackmore gave a thumbs up before disappearing.</span></p><p><span>It became dark again.&#xA0;</span><span>Soon, a rock appeared.&#xA0;</span><span>Someone had carved letters on them.&#xA0;</span><span>A familiar phrase.</span></p><p><span>[A warrior doesn&#x2019;t attack unarmed people.]</span></p><p><span>It was Arnin&#x2019;s landscape.&#xA0;</span><span>He was looking at Enyanis who previously gave him citizenship. Now he was the mayor.&#xA0;</span><span>He was reading a letter.&#xA0;</span><span>The sender was Derek.&#xA0;</span><span>He read the letter then tore it up. He threw it in the trash. Then he spat on it. Enyanis got up and looked out the window.</span></p><p><span>He smiled as he looked at the beautiful landscape of Arnin.&#xA0;</span><span>Then he turned and looked at something hanging on the wall of the office.&#xA0;</span><span>It was a uniform.&#xA0;</span><span>The uniform of those protecting the Arnin Plains. On top of it was Crockta&#x2019;s name. Enyanis looked at it and nodded.</span></p><p><span>The landscape blurred.&#xA0;</span><span>The places of his adventures appeared before passing by. At the end, Crockta could see him.&#xA0;</span><span>An unforgettable face.</span></p><p><span>&quot;Lenox.&quot;</span></p><p><span>Lenox.</span></p><p><span>Behind him stood the orc warriors. Where did they go after they died? Did death really erase everything? Or..&#xA0;</span><span>Lenox raised his axe without speaking.</span></p><p><span>Crockta&#x2019;s eyes widened.&#xA0;</span><span>Lenox wielded his axe.&#xA0;</span><span>The axe slammed into Crockta.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Cough!&#x201D;</span></p><p></p><p style="text-align: center"><span>***</span></p><p></p><p><span>&#x201C;Cough!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Crockta opened his eyes.</span></p><p><span>Calmahart the great chieftain&#x2019;s face was in front of him.&#xA0;</span><span>His face was filled with surprise. He gave more strength to his hands.&#xA0;</span><span>He was choking Crockta&#x2019;s neck with a tremendous force. The big sword stuck in his abdomen didn&#x2019;t budge.</span></p><p><span>Did Crockta have a short dream for a moment?&#xA0;</span><span>Just what did he see?</span></p><p><span>Crockta gathered all the strength in his body and kicked the handle of Ogre Slayer.&#xA0;</span><span>The moment that the greatsword shook.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Cough!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Calmahart bled from the mouth as his grip weakened. Crockta removed the loosened hand and rolled to the floor.&#xA0;</span><span>Blood rose to his face again. He stayed on the floor for a moment.&#xA0;</span><span>Then he raised his head.</span></p><p><span>Calmahart was pulling out Ogre Slayer.&#xA0;</span><span>Crockta tackled Calmahart before the sword could be fully pulled out. Calmahart and the sword fell tangled together.&#xA0;</span><span>Crockta got on top of Calmahart. He pulled out Ogre Slayer completely.</span></p><p><span>He was about to thrust the sword down.</span></p><p><i><span>Peeok!</span></i></p><p><span>Calmahart&#x2019;s fist rose and hit Crockta on the chin. He recovered his mind and gripped the handle of Ogre Slayer tightly.</span></p><p><i><span>Peeok!</span></i></p><p><span>The punches continued. Ogre Slayer tried to target Calmahart but the ensuing punches kept interrupting. It was difficult to use the greatsword in this situation.</span></p><p><span>&quot;Dammit!&quot;</span></p><p><span>Crockta put Ogre Slayer away and swung his fist.&#xA0;</span><span>One of Calmahart&#x2019;s teeth broke. Crockta&#x2019;s fist headed downwards without stopping. Calmahart also thwarted his attack. The two punched at each other.</span></p><p><span>Calmahart&#x2019;s arm was long enough to stop Crockta&#x2019;s attack, but Crockta&#x2019;s punch kept hitting the same spot.&#xA0;</span><span>Their faces were covered with blood.&#xA0;</span><span>But the moment that Crockta was about to raise a fist again,</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Yiiiiik!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Calmahart&#x2019;s forehead shone. Then a huge force pushed at Crockta.&#xA0;</span><span>Crockta rolled across the ground.</span></p><p><span>&quot;Kukuku...this was nice.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span><span>Calmahart got up. His big body cast a shadow on Crockta. His eyes were red.&#xA0;</span><span>&#x201C;But now your tricks will end.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>A red aura covered Calmahart&#x2019;s body. His body swelled even more. Now he was a monster, not an orc. Every time he walked, the ground shook.</span></p><p><span>Crockta realized that something was different.&#xA0;</span><span>He lifted Ogre Slayer.&#xA0;</span><span>Calmahart swung his fists without using a weapon. Crockta wielded the greatsword. The fist hit the sword.&#xA0;</span><span>And it was Crockta who was thrown back. As the fist struck Ogre Slayer, a tremendous shock wave occurred.</span></p><p><span>Crockta was thrown out of the tent. Blood rose in his mouth.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Kuheok.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Crockta coughed up blood.&#xA0;</span><span>Calmahart walked out. His red eyes burned in the darkness of the night.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;The entertainment was sufficient. Now you will die.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span><span>He laughed.&#xA0;</span><span>&#x201C;Crockta.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Then he raised his fist up to the sky. He joined both hands together and made them look like a hammer. Then he brought it down towards Crockta.</span></p><p><span>If this hit, he would die.&#xA0;</span><span>Crockta sensed it.&#xA0;</span><span>Yes, blocking it might also kill him. He needed to avoid it.&#xA0;</span><span>His instincts screamed at him. Crockta squeezed out all the strength in his body and rushed away.</span></p><p><span>The fist hit the floor.&#xA0;</span><span>The ground convulsed.&#xA0;</span><span>It was an incredible force. The red energy in Calmahart&#x2019;s body was boiling like a haze.&#xA0;</span><span>Crockta realized that it was the source of Calmahart&#x2019;s power. He wasn&#x2019;t in a normal state.</span></p><p><span>The situation had been so urgent that he couldn&#x2019;t see it clearly, but there was apparently an apostle mark on his forehead, similar to Zelkian&#x2019;s.&#xA0;</span><span>Their concerns were right.&#xA0;</span><span>He could borrow the power of a god.</span></p><p><span>Calmahart ran up to Crockta, who turned around and ran.&#xA0;</span><span>He was out of the range of the silence area that he had set up.&#xA0;</span><span>The chase between them attracted the orcs&#x2019; attention. Orcs started to appear one after another.</span></p><p><span>They screamed as they discovered Calmahart chasing Crockta.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;What?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Great chieftain!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;The enemy!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>The orcs grabbed their weapons.&#xA0;</span><span>Crockta swung Ogre Slayer without hesitation. The screams of the soldiers rang out.&#xA0;</span><span>Calmahart chased Crockta without caring about the well-being of his soldiers.&#xA0;</span><span>The orcs were blown away by his movements. The orcs in front of his fists were instantly killed.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Where are you running to? Weak bastard! Come here!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Calmahart&#x2019;s voice was distorted like a demon. The bodies of orcs were strewn around the area where he passed.&#xA0;</span><span>He was a mad monster.</span></p><p><span>Crockta looked at the moon. It wasn&#x2019;t midnight yet.&#xA0;</span><span>Crockta rushed towards the army of orcs to buy some time.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;You can&#x2019;t get away!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>One of the warriors interrupted him. Crockta swung his greatsword, but the warrior also wielded his axe and blocked Crockta&#x2019;s attack. Calmahart was running from behind.&#xA0;</span><span>Crockta continued to attack in a hurry, but the warrior calmly blocked.&#xA0;</span><span>It was amazing since the warrior&#x2019;s goal was buying time. Crockta&#x2019;s eyebrows twitched.</span></p><p><span>&quot;Bul&#x2019;tarrrr!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>The blade moved vertically.&#xA0;</span><span>The warrior raised his axe, but Crocta&#x2019;s sword slammed into him before he could. He was split in half. </span></p><p><span>Then Crockta ran again.&#xA0;</span><span>Calmahart narrowed the distance.&#xA0;</span><span>Something was flying behind him.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;......!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Crockta rolled on the ground as he received a shock in his back.&#xA0;</span><span>It was the body of the orc he just killed. His blood and internal organs poured down on Crockta. There was an awful smell.</span></p><p><span>Crockta got up. Calmahart&#x2019;s fist flew. He rolled to avoid it.&#xA0;</span><span>The shadow of Calmahart grew bigger.</span></p><p><span>&quot;Dammit.&quot;</span></p><p><span>A monstrous guy.</span></p><p><span>Crockta grinned.&#xA0;</span><span>Calmahart and the other orcs surrounded him. He was completely surrounded. In a situation where he couldn&#x2019;t escape, he confronted Calmahart alone.&#xA0;</span><span>He held Ogre Slayer.&#xA0;</span><span>He didn&#x2019;t think he would win, but he wasn&#x2019;t going to avoid a fight.</span></p><p><span>Calmahart smiled as he looked down at Crockta.&#xA0;</span><span>Then he wielded his fist like a thunderbolt.</span></p><p><span>The greatsword blocked it but there was a shock wave. It was an absurd physical strength.&#xA0;</span><span>Calmahart&#x2019;s other hand aimed towards Crockta&#x2019;s head.&#xA0;</span><span>Outside his field of view, a giant fist made a circular trajectory.</span></p><p><span>If this hit, his head would burst.&#xA0;</span><span>But his body was floating in the air.&#xA0;</span><span>Ogre Slayer was on the other side of that fist.&#xA0;</span><span>It was an attack he couldn&apos;t avoid or block.&#xA0;</span><span>Shortly thereafter, the presence of the fist flying towards his head could be felt.&#xA0;</span><span>Death was around the corner. This feeling caused the sensations on his body to sharpen.</span></p><p><span>The world slowed.&#xA0;</span><span>It slowed down again.&#xA0;</span><span>The fist flying towards him. The eyes of the orcs hoping for his death. The moonlight shining down from the sky and the wind.&#xA0;</span><span>Everything was felt.</span></p><p><span>It was all pointing to his death.&#xA0;</span><span>Just like a pebble falling from the sky, Calmahart&#x2019;s fist would cause his head to explode.&#xA0;</span><span>It couldn&#x2019;t be avoided.</span></p><p><span>And Crockta.</span></p><p><span>He.</span></p><p><span>Refused.</span></p><p><span>The world&apos;s balance was reversed.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;......!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>At that moment, Calmahart&#x2019;s eyes widened.&#xA0;</span><span>Ogre Slayer.&#xA0;</span><span>It moved and blocked his fist. The blade moved and met Calmahart&#x2019;s fist.&#xA0;</span><span>Blood vessels burst.</span></p><p><span>&quot;Kuaaaaak!&quot;</span></p><p><span>Calmahart grabbed his fist.</span></p><p><span>Crockta couldn&#x2019;t believe what he had just done.&#xA0;</span><span>It was clearly impossible to defend. In addition, Ogre Slayer had sliced through Calmahart&#x2019;s skin, which was as hard as armor.&#xA0;</span><span>It was a miracle beyond cause and effect.</span></p><p><span>&#x2018;But beyond that, there is an area where you can wield the world.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span>&#x2018;The people who managed to do it were called Heroes.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span>That was it.&#xA0;</span><span>Crockta&#x2019;s movements had temporarily surpassed the Pinnacle.&#xA0;</span><span>Calmahart was still holding his hand. His eyes were filled with rage.&#xA0;</span><span>Crockta turned and jumped into the orcs surrounding him.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Stop him!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Stop him!&quot;</span></p><p><span>The orcs shouted, but they were split in half every time Crockta&#x2019;s Ogre Slayer was swung.&#xA0;</span><span>Crockta sprang from the ground and jumped over them.</span></p><p><span>The new moon was above his head.&#xA0;</span><span>It was midnight.&#xA0;</span><span>At that moment, the pumpkin carriage hovered above his head.&#xA0;</span><span>Crockta quickly climbed onto the pumpkin carriage. Crockta&#x2019;s appearance gradually blurred.</span></p><p><i><span>Seuk.</span></i></p><p><span>Soon after, he disappeared.&#xA0;</span><span>Nothing remained but the air.</span></p><p><span>Calmahart grit his teeth and roared madly towards Crockta.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Crocktaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>It was a fierce cry that could tear through metal.</span></p><p><span>Calmahart shouted,&#xA0;</span><span>&#x201C;Right now! March&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;! Kill everyone&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>He stomped his feet. The earth shook.&#xA0;</span><span>His eyes were red. The mark on his head was also tinged red.&#xA0;</span><span>Only a massacre of blood could relieve his anger.</span></p><p><span>The real war began.</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p>
