<p><span>Chapter 97 - Monsters (2)</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p><p><span>Aden&#x2019;s conspiracy was stopped by Tiyo&#x2019;s actions.</span></p><p><span>The garrison leader announced that the situation was over. Vigor started to return to Nameragon and citizens reappeared on the deserted streets and in the plaza.&#xA0;</span><span>Their response was surprisingly lackadaisical.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;What? I told you that Radet was going to fix it.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Radet is mayor, so how could Aden overthrow him?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;The garrison suffered, truly suffered.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Nameragon started to return to its ordinary routine.</span></p><p><span>It would&#x2019;ve been a dangerous situation without Crockta&#x2019;s group, but the citizens firmly believed in Radet. It was clear how much faith he normally gave.&#xA0;</span><span>Radet went around Nameragon to thank the citizens and stabilize the public.</span></p><p><span>&quot;Citizens! Thank you! Thanks to your calm actions, we were able to finish the situation quickly. Hahahat!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Hey, thank you, Mayor.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;No. No. This isn&#x2019;t my work. Hahat! Aden was a little bit hard!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Occasionally, there were people who became nervous about Crockta&#x2019;s group.&#xA0;</span><span>&quot;Mayor. Who is that orc and that gnome? The situation is chaotic and...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Ahh, they are my friends. They helped a lot.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;If you say so, Mayor.&quot;</span></p><p><span>Radet toured the city once before returning to City Hall.&#xA0;</span><span>He had yet to decide what to do with Driden and Aden, who were tied up.</span></p><p><span>Radet sighed, &quot;Let&apos;s hold off until Jamero returns.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>He ignored Aden&#x2019;s poisonous glance and struck his back.&#xA0;</span><span>&quot;If you were caught in some magic, I have to consider that.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>He believed that there was a shaman who was assisting the great chieftain.&#xA0;</span><span>Aden didn&#x2019;t deny it. He didn&#x2019;t think he would fall for such a trick, but he wasn&#x2019;t going to throw away the chance of cutting down his punishment after being defeated. He certainly was an opportunist.</span></p><p><span>Radet&#x2019;s gaze turned towards Driden.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Driden.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Radet called his name.&#xA0;</span><span>Driden shook his head no emotion on his face. However a raging fire could be seen within his eyes.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;The son of Hurio.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span><span>Driden nodded in response.</span></p><p><span>Radet recalled the past.</span></p><p><span>Hurio used a pair of swords, just like Driden.&#xA0;</span><span>His nickname was sword demon.&#xA0;</span><span>He swung his swords like two demons were attached to his arms.&#xA0;</span><span>And Radet killed him.</span></p><p><span>&quot;I definitely killed him.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Driden&#x2019;s hands twitched. He was instinctively looking for his swords. However, there was nothing he could wield.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;But I don&#x2019;t regret it. Do you know what your father was like?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;......&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;He was a madman who killed everyone around him.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>That&#x2019;s right. Hurio wasn&#x2019;t in a normal state. He was a swordsman who traveled around the north on an adventure, but suffered critical injuries in a fight one day.&#xA0;</span><span>The wounds could be treated, but the pain and fallout from it caused him to become paranoid, eventually turning him into a madman.</span></p><p><span>&quot;Do you know?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Driden dropped his head.&#xA0;</span><span>He spat on the ground and looked back up, this time with no emotion in his eyes.&#xA0;</span><span>&#x201C;So?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;I did what I had to do.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;It doesn&#x2019;t matter.&quot;&#xA0;</span><span>Driden looked at Radet&#x2019;s neck. If he managed to get his hands on anything around him, he would slice away at Radet&#x2019;s face.&#xA0;</span><span>He would perform the given task without any emotions, like a butcher mechanically cutting up meat.</span></p><p><span>&quot;I was also doing my job.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span><span>Driden responded and Radet realized something.</span></p><p><span>Driden was a sword.&#xA0;</span><span>He was a sword that was smelted by Hurio and then wielded by Aden in order to achieve a goal.&#xA0;</span><span>He was an incomplete weapon that could only orbit the enemy, unable to turn or stop on his own.</span></p><p><span>He only looked at his task: To kill the enemy.</span></p><p><span>&quot;Put everyone in jail.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Yes.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>The garrison soldiers dragged them out one by one.&#xA0;</span><span>They would be detained in jail. He would wait for Jamero&#x2019;s advice before making the final decision.</span></p><p><span>Radet returned to his office.&#xA0;</span><span>He sat on the chair.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Hoo.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Countless documents were on the wide table.&#xA0;</span><span>This was the battlefield he was facing right now.&#xA0;</span><span>There were a number of public works waiting for his signature, from minor administration to cooperation with Spinoa and countermeasures against the Great Clan.</span></p><p><span>Now his body was like Nameragon, so the enemy&#x2019;s sword was also heading towards his body.&#xA0;</span><span>Compared to this, it was much simpler when he traveled around the world with a sword.</span></p><p><span>He recalled the three visitors. The orc warrior Crockta, the gnome soldier Tiyo and the half elf from Nuridot, Anor.&#xA0;</span><span>Radet was once like that.&#xA0;</span><span>He felt envious.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;No.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>He laughed and shook his head.&#xA0;</span><span>He didn&#x2019;t want to return to the past. The memories he recalled with an ambiguous smile, they weren&#x2019;t always good. Radet&#x2019;s eyes always looked at the reality he faced.</span></p><p><span>In the past, his enemies were people who wielded the sword right in front of his eyes. But now his enemy was the north.&#xA0;</span><span>The dark elves would find it hard to overcome the waves of hardship that the great chieftain would create. Therefore, he needed to be more firm.</span></p><p><span>This weapon should be something other than a sword.</span></p><p><i><span>Knock knock knock.</span></i></p><p><span>Someone knocked on the door of the office.&#xA0;</span><span>Radet grinned and said, &quot;Come in.&quot;</span></p><p><span>It was Crockta, Tiyo, and Anor.&#xA0;</span>Radet pointed to the chairs opposite the desk and welcomed, &quot;Please relax.&#x201D;</p><p><span>Crockta didn&#x2019;t sit down.&#xA0;</span><span>&#x201C;I need your permission to enter the Temple of the Fallen God.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Correct.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Please allow it.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Um...&#x201D;&#xA0;</span><span>Radet smiled. It wasn&#x2019;t easy for him to negotiate.&#xA0;</span><span>&quot;Not just anyone can enter the Temple of the Fallen God...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Tiyo puffed up as he proudly proclaimed, &quot;We aren&#x2019;t just anyone! We are benefactors who saved Nameragon </span><i><span>dot</span></i><span>!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;That&#x2019;s correct but...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Crockta saw Radet&#x2019;s mock hesitation and said, &quot;Radet, stop pretending and tell us what you want.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Radet nodded.&#xA0;</span><span>&quot;Crockta, you noticed quickly.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;What else do you want from us </span><i><span>dot</span></i><span>? You are really shameless.&quot;</span></p><p><span>&quot;I&apos;m sorry but I&#x2019;m not a single body.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span><span>Radet shrugged and knocked on the table. The papers were piled up. He meant that Nameragon was his share as well.&#xA0;</span><span>&quot;If you go to Nameragon&#x2019;s jail, Driden will be trapped.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Um.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Please bring him around.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Tiyo frowned.&#xA0;</span><span>&quot;No, why do we need to bring that guy around? You do it </span><i><span>dot</span></i><span>?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;I can&#x2019;t do it, but it might be possible for you. Especially if it is Crockta.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span><span>Radet gazed at Crockta.&#xA0;</span><span>&#x201C;During your fight, did you see Driden&#x2019;s face? He is that type of guy. A man stronger than him has to show him the way. Right now, he has lost his way and is only caught up in revenge for his father.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Radet rose from his seat and approached Crockta. He then handed over a piece of paper. Crockta&#x2019;s eyes narrowed as he read it.</span></p><p><span>&quot;That stupid guy, tell him his fate.&#x201D;</span></p><p></p><p style="text-align: center"><span>***</span></p><p></p><p><span>Crockta headed towards Nameragon&#x2019;s garrison. There was a detention room in the basement.&#xA0;</span><span>The defense leader guided Crockta.&#xA0;</span><span>Driden was staring into the darkness with both arms tied in a corner of the detention room.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Open the door,&#x201D; commanded Crockta.&#xA0;</span><span>The garrison leader looked at Crockta silently opening the door..</span></p><p><span>&quot;We will be out here, so take care of it </span><i><span>dot</span></i><span>.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span><span>Tiyo folded his arms in dissatisfaction. He didn&#x2019;t know why Crockta was supposed to take on this task.</span></p><p><span>Crockta entered alone.&#xA0;</span><span>Driden turned his head. Crockta&#x2019;s massive body filled the jail as he looked down at Driden.&#xA0;</span><span>There was a faint smile on Driden&#x2019;s face.</span></p><p><span>&quot;Hey. Orc.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Dark elf.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Driden was imprisoned without proper clothes.&#xA0;</span><span>There were bruises all over his body and his lips were swollen from beatings.</span></p><p><span>Then he said, &#x201C;It was fun.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Crockta nodded.</span></p><p><span>Radet was right.&#xA0;</span><span>This guy was a sword that needed constant enemies. It was understandable why his father was crazy.&#xA0;</span><span>A sword needed to be swung at someone.&#xA0;</span><span>So far, Aden had been holding the hilt and now Radet wanted to hold it.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;I had a moderate amount of fun.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Crockta, no, Jung Ian, was once a sword in the hands of others. The most regrettable thing about his past actions was that they weren&#x2019;t based on his own will, but on other people&#x2019;s decisions. Even if he felt regret, he could tolerate if he decided it for himself. But his past self didn&#x2019;t do that.</span></p><p><span>He thought of the Ian &#xA0;of the past every time he saw Driden.&#xA0;</span><span>This guy was like a bird who just broke out of his shell and didn&#x2019;t know anything.&#xA0;</span><span>He just swung the blade.</span></p><p><span>Crockta lowered his head so that he was eye level with Driden. The swordsman frowned as the orc&#x2019;s rugged face was pushed in front of him.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Phew.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span><span>Crockta sighed and shook his head. He didn&#x2019;t even appreciate a handsome face and was just a baby swinging a sword.&#xA0;</span><span>&quot;Pathetic guy.&quot;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;What?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;That&apos;s fine.&quot;&#xA0;</span><span>Crockta got up.&#xA0;</span><span>&quot;What would you have done if you had killed the enemy?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;......&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;No plans?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;It is none of your business.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;If it doesn&#x2019;t exist, just say so.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;......&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;No.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Suddenly, Crockta slapped Driden.</span></p><p><i><span>Slap!</span></i></p><p><span>&quot;......!&quot;</span></p><p><span>Those outside who heard the sound were more surprised than Driden, the one who had been hit.</span></p><p><span>&quot;...Shit.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span><span>Driden bowed his face after he was slapped. He checked his mouth with his tongue and spat out blood.</span></p><p><span>Crockta spoke, &quot;Are you angry?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;......&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Driden raised his head.&#xA0;</span><span>His eyes were blazing.&#xA0;</span><span>It was like he was looking at a mortal enemy with a burning anger in his eyes. His arms twitched as if they were saying that he wanted to wield a sword at that very moment.</span></p><p><span>The depth of emotion was different from when he was being beaten by the guards.&#xA0;</span><span>The insults of others didn&#x2019;t reach him.&#xA0;</span><span>However, the slap of the orc was like pouring boiling hot oil on him.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;This look is good. When you kill the enemy, come back for revenge.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Crockta laughed as he looked at Driden&#x2019;s eyes that now looked alive.&#xA0;</span><span>Then he dropped the piece of paper that Radet had given him.</span></p><p><span>&quot;Judge who the enemy is for yourself.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Driden&#x2019;s gaze turned towards the paper.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;This brat.&#x201D;</span></p><p><i><span>Slap!</span></i></p><p><span>Crockta looked at him and slapped Driden one more time before leaving straight away. He felt a terrifying gaze stuck on his back.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;This bad... Ugly orc!&#x201D;&#xA0;</span><span>Driden&#x2019;s incensed voice was heard for the first time. The bad guy, the ugly orc left the jail.</span></p><p><span>Crockta hurriedly escaped the underground detention room.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Phew. He has a temper.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>As soon as he left, the guard handed him something and said, &quot;Take this.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;......?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Crockta accepted it.</span></p><p><span>&quot;The mayor told me to give this to you after you met Driden.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>It was a permit to enter the Temple of the Fallen God. Radet said to give the permit, regardless of his success or failure.&#xA0;</span><span>He was a relatively tricky dark elf.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Thank you. Tell Radet that I did my best.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;...That includes slapping him?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;It is an orc thing.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Crockta left the garrison building.&#xA0;</span><span>Finally, he could reach his destination, the Temple of the Fallen God.&#xA0;</span><span>He could finally go there.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;But what did it say on the piece of paper you gave to the dark elf </span><i><span>dot</span></i><span>?&#x201D; asked Tiyo.</span></p><p><span>Crockta shrugged.&#xA0;</span><span>&quot;It was about his father.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;The elf named Hurio?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Yes. Radet killed his father. The paper stated why Hurio became a madman.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Hurio received critical wounds and became a murderer after that.&#xA0;</span><span>If he didn&#x2019;t get hurt, Hurio might&#x2019;ve remained as a swordsman and not be killed by Radet.&#xA0;</span><span>And the one who wounded him.</span></p><p><span>&quot;It was an attack by an orc from the Great Clan.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Hrmm...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Tiyo nodded. Driden had to choose if his enemy would still be Radet, or if he should turn his sword and become hostile to the Great Clan.</span></p><p><span>&quot;By the way, that dark elf called Driden,&#x201D; quietly interrupted Anor.&#xA0;</span><span>There was a serious expression on his face.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Why, did you find something <em>dot</em>?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;It&#x2019;s a little weird.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;What are you saying <em>dot</em>?&#x201D;&#xA0;</span><span>Tiyo focused on Anor&#x2019;s words.</span></p><p><span>Anor said.&#xA0;</span><span>&quot;Doesn&#x2019;t he know any curses? Ahahahat. Bad guy, ugly orc... What a young baby. Ahahahat. Saying things like that. Really funny.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;......&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;If I had been slapped, I wouldn&#x2019;t have stopped with that. The dog bas....oof ooof!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Stop it </span><i><span>dot</span></i><span>.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Tiyo blocked his mouth.&#xA0;</span><span>Anor continued trying to assert himself. Crockta joined in to cover his mouth.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Hup hup! Fuup! Fuup yop doppp! Hup hup!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Putting up with this </span><i><span>dot.</span></i><span>..&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Anor, children are watching...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>The dark elf children walking down the street were shocked and fled. Crockta shook his head.&#xA0;</span><span>Anyhow, they somehow managed to reach the Temple of the Fallen God.</span></p><p></p><p style="text-align: center"><span>***</span></p><p></p><p><span>&quot;Mayor, Driden surrendered. Aden and his group are separated from each other.&quot;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;......&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Radet nodded. He was stamping the papers.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;By the way... you are truly the mayor.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;What do you mean?&quot;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Bringing Driden to your side.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Radet laughed.&#xA0;</span><span>&quot;Let&apos;s see...&quot;</span></p><p><span>&quot;I never imagined that he would direct his grudge towards the orcs.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span><span>The adjutant spoke in a lowered tone.&#xA0;</span><span>&quot;In fact, Hurio&#x2019;s wounds weren&#x2019;t due to orcs. Huhuhut.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Shut up.&quot;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Ah, I&#x2019;m sorry.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Radet extended a pile of paperwork.&#xA0;</span><span>&quot;Process these.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Yes. I will execute them right away.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>The adjutant scurried out of the office.&#xA0;</span><span>Radet leaned back in his chair.</span></p><p><span>&quot;I don&#x2019;t know if it is good...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>His friend Hurio didn&#x2019;t suffer a critical injury from an orc, but a creature.</span></p><p><span>Radet lied.&#xA0;</span><span>It was so that he could use Driden to defend the dark elves in the future against the Great Clan.</span></p><p><span>Radet muttered bitterly, &quot;I am now a politician.&#x201D;</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p><p><a href="www.wuxiaworld.com">Glossary of Common Korean Terms.</a></p><p>Praise the Orc:&#xA0;<a href="docs.google.com">Glossary Link.&#xA0;</a></p><p>Current schedule:&#xA0;<strong>Next Patreon goal has been reached!!
