<p><span>Chapter 176 - What Happened on the Beach (1)</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p><p><span>Ian stretched...</span></p><p><span>The sea stretched out before him.&#xA0;</span><span>He was currently on a beach in Gangwon-do, facing the East Sea.&#xA0;</span><span>Ian had been stuck in his house all day playing Elder Lord, so his body was a bit stiff.&#xA0;</span><span>He&#x2019;d gone on a solo trip in order to rejuvenate himself, and he&#x2019;d picked this place because he missed the sea.&#xA0;</span><span>Just looking at the blue sea made him feel better. He stretched his body and took in the fresh air. The sunshine was also pleasant.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;You have to tilt your upper body. You shouldn&#x2019;t bow. Don&#x2019;t touch the board.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>On one side of the beach, a surf class was in session. Brightly dressed men and women were repeatedly lying down and standing up on the surfboard.&#xA0;</span><span>It seemed moderately amusing.</span></p><p><span>Surfing... Ian should learn it once.&#xA0;</span><span>He had never learned any sports apart from martial arts.&#xA0;</span><span>Turning his gaze away, Ian saw surfers splashing in the water. Most of them weren&#x2019;t able to stand properly, but they didn&#x2019;t get tired, and some managed to slip nicely towards the beach.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;I don&#x2019;t like the rashguards.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Ian turned his head as he unexpectedly heard a voice.&#xA0;</span><span>A man was standing there.&#xA0;</span><span>He wore glasses, and his hair was strangely gray. However, he didn&#x2019;t seem old. In fact, he was in his mid-30s.</span></p><p><span>As he stared into the sun, the man spoke with furrowed brows,&#xA0;</span><span>&#x201C;It is annoying. People should go into the sea with bare skin. That is real. But the clothing companies make all these things, and they cover up their body unnecessarily. Youth is just a fleeting moment. Don&#x2019;t you think so?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>The man looked at Ian.&#xA0;</span><span>It was the first time they&#x2019;d met.</span></p><p><span>Ian started laughing.&#xA0;</span><span>&#x201C;That&apos;s right.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>This might be the attraction of traveling. He had accidentally met an interesting person.</span></p><p><span>The man nodded.&#xA0;</span><span>&#x201C;Take your clothes off. The sun should see you.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Then the person in question took off his coat, revealing a body without any obvious fat. He was wearing aloha shorts.&#xA0;</span><span>He walked forward with clear eyes.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;You.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Huh?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Do you know how to surf?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;I don&apos;t know.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Indeed, you look like you don&#x2019;t know how.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Ian&#x2019;s eyebrows twitched.&#xA0;</span><span>He looked like he didn&#x2019;t know how? What did that mean?&#xA0;</span><span>Ian had never failed at any exercise.&#xA0;</span><span>Even when he played with a ball during his childhood, his natural athleticism meant he could easily get the ball past his peers.</span></p><p><span>It was like Cristiano Ronaldo with a soccer ball, Stephen Curry with a basketball, and Roger Federer with a tennis ball. They were different.&#xA0;</span><span>Although it was true that Ian didn&#x2019;t know anything about surfing, it was unacceptable to be seen as a desk-bound person.</span></p><p><span>The man didn&#x2019;t sense Ian&#x2019;s anger as he spoke casually,&#xA0;</span><span>&#x201C;Then do you want to learn from me?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Ian made a questioning sound and laughed.&#xA0;</span><span>&#x201C;You can surf?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Didn&#x2019;t I say it? This friend, you should learn how to look at people.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span><span>The man draped his jacket around his neck.&#xA0;</span><span>&#x201C;Follow me. I&apos;ll teach you one on one. This opportunity isn&#x2019;t common.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Ian was interested... in surfing, as well as this person.&#xA0;</span><span>The man left the white sand with Ian and headed to the surf store across the road.&#xA0;</span><span>There was a man with a suntanned body and a reggae hairstyle sitting on a rocking chair. He raised his sunglasses to his head and waved.&#xA0;</span><span>The eyes behind the sunglasses were unexpectedly innocent.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Hey, Hyung-nim.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;You look good.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Hah, I was active until dawn...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;I&#x2019;m teaching him how to surf, so please give me a few things.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;I understand. Jinchul! Get me one set of equipment! One set!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Yes!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>An answer called out from inside.&#xA0;</span><span>Then a charming young man appeared. He greeted Ian with blurry eyes as if he had also been awake until dawn.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Ah, hello. It must be your first time.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Yes.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Do you want separate clothing or rashguards? If not, there is this suit. Your height is similar to me, so the size should be...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Ian received a full body suit which appeared to be used for scuba diving.&#xA0;</span><span>Then when Ian tried to pay for the rental, he was rejected.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;This is fine. Hyung-nim&#x2019;s guests always receive it for free.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Ian looked at the man outside the store and the store owner. The man outside was looking at the sea with his hands behind his back.</span></p><p><span>He asked, &#x201C;What is that person like?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Hyung-nim? I have no idea.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span><span>The young man laughed.&#xA0;</span><span>&#x201C;He is just close to the boss. Shouldn&#x2019;t you know?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;We met for the first time today.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Really? How strange. Well, it is like this. You can change inside.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Ian put on the equipment, received a big surfboard, and exited the store.&#xA0;</span><span>Ian&#x2019;s board was thick and felt like a sponge, while the man&#x2019;s was nice and waxy.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;This surfing equipment sucks.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;It isn&#x2019;t good?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;That isn&#x2019;t the main part. Surfing is. It&#x2019;s cool.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>The man said before looking at Ian.&#xA0;</span><span>Ian jumped with surprise.&#xA0;</span><span>The man now had blue makeup on his face which drew across his cheekbones and nose. It was like seeing the battle makeup barbarians wore in movies.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;What is it? Do you want some?&#x201D;&#xA0;</span><span>The man handed the tube to Ian. It was sunscreen. Unlike other clear sunscreens, this one had a vivid color.&#xA0;</span><span>&#x201C;Just put it on your nose. It is expensive, so I am saving it.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Surfers seemed to pursue their own beauty, so Ian tried it as well.&#xA0;</span><span>Thus, they headed towards the sandy white beach.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;We can only surf in this area, so be careful.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>A separate surfing area was designated on the beach.&#xA0;</span><span>They headed there. In addition to them, there were other people receiving surfing lessons.&#xA0;</span><span>Most of the people on the surfboards weren&#x2019;t able to ride the waves properly and hung on like seaweed.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;I am harsh, so you should be prepared.&#x201D;</span></p><p></p><p style="text-align: center"><span>***</span></p><p></p><p><span>Unlike his harsh words, the man was a really shabby teacher.&#xA0;</span><span>He just said that Ian had to move his arms on the board and get up. Then he demonstrated once or twice before immediately pushing Ian into the sea.</span></p><p><span>Ian couldn&#x2019;t even practice and had to try it out on the waves.&#xA0;</span><span>Of course, that was enough.&#xA0;</span><span>Ian did well with his natural athleticism.&#xA0;</span><span>He waited for the waves before gently getting up at the right time. Then he balanced himself.</span></p><p><span>lan was satisfied. He was like Ronaldo with a soccer ball, Curry with a basketball, and Federer with a tennis ball. Now, he took on the board... like Phelps with swimming.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Well done.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>The man spoke. Ian replied,&#xA0;</span><span>&#x201C;You are really good.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>The man was skillfully riding the waves. His hair barely got wet, unlike most of the people who couldn&#x2019;t ride or balance.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Kyaaak!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>During a moment of waiting, a woman slipped on her surfboard and slid towards Ian.&#xA0;</span><span>Her board hit Ian&#x2019;s back...</span></p><p><span>And he was pushed by it.</span></p><p><span>Ian and the woman tangled together, and the two of them fell below the surface of the water.&#xA0;</span><span>They struggled for a moment before reaching the surface. The woman with wet hair apologized to Ian,</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Wah! I&apos;m sorry. Are you okay? I&#x2019;m so sorry.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Ian touched his back. It was fortunate that the woman&#x2019;s board was for beginners. So, this was why they used a sponge-like material.&#xA0;</span><span>If it were the board, which the man teaching Ian had, that hit him, his flesh would&#x2019;ve been torn.</span></p><p><span>Ian smiled as he touched his back.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;I&#x2019;m fine. Please be careful.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Ah...&#x201D;&#xA0;</span><span>The woman was speechless at Ian&#x2019;s gentle reaction. Then she grabbed Ian&#x2019;s arm as he moved away.&#xA0;</span><span>&#x201C;Are you sure you&#x2019;re okay? That would&#x2019;ve hurt. What can I do?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;It&#x2019;s okay.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;I&apos;m really sorry.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Ian shrugged, saying that it was okay. Then the woman grabbed her board and said,</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Please tell me if you get any problems later on.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;I will.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;If you need a number...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;No. It&#x2019;s really fine. Have fun surfing.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Ah, yes. You too.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>The woman bowed and pushed her board towards the other side of the beach.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;You didn&#x2019;t notice.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Ian flinched. The man had approached.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;You surprised me,&#x201D; Ian said.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;No. You noticed.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;What are you talking about?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Look.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span><span>The man shouted,&#xA0;</span><span>&#x201C;Hey, you over there! Come here! What are you doing just hitting someone?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>The woman turned around in surprise at his shout.&#xA0;</span><span>She looked at Ian and then at the man. The man beckoned and she returned.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Girl, you were wrong.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Huh?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;You shouldn&#x2019;t hit people with your board. Isn&#x2019;t that right?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;That&apos;s right. I&#x2019;m sorry...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;You are a very dangerous girl.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;......&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;So, give me your phone number.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Huh?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;I need a phone number to contact you if there are any problems later.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Ah, yes. Yes. Then my number...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>She gave her number. Then he spoke to Ian,&#xA0;</span><span>&#x201C;Tell me your number as well.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Why?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Do you really not know? Quickly.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;That...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Give your number to the other person so they will know it is you.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span>Ian gave his number. The man repeated it a few times for the woman to remember.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Girl, you do remember it?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Yes. I remember.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;That&apos;s great. Did you come here for a few days to play? Is it a vacation?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Yes, I leave the day after tomorrow.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;This boy as well.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>The man winked. The woman laughed.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Then I&#x2019;ll be going. Have fun.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Yes, I&#x2019;m sorry. Have fun.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>The woman smiled and pushed away on her board. The woman&#x2019;s group were watching her anxiously, and she waved.</span></p><p><span>Ian laughed and asked,&#xA0;</span><span>&#x201C;What are you doing now?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;This is youth. Eat a lot, pray a lot, and love a lot.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;But my situation...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;You don&#x2019;t have a girlfriend?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;......&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Then it&#x2019;s okay.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span><span>He tapped Ian&#x2019;s shoulders.&#xA0;</span><span>&#x201C;Let&#x2019;s get out. I did a lot. I&#x2019;m thirsty. I&#x2019;ll buy you a beer.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>The man spoke informally to Ian, but Ian didn&#x2019;t feel any anger towards this unknown man.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Understood.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Ian smiled and followed him.</span></p><p></p><p style="text-align: center"><span>***</span></p><p></p><p><span>They put their equipment away and found a homemade beer store not far from the beach.&#xA0;</span><span>There were surfboards and equipment displayed inside the beer store. Surfing was famous at this beach, so it had a lot of influence.</span></p><p><span>The man ordered beer and fries for himself.</span></p><p><span>The screen in the store was showing Elder Lord.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;There was an uproar.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>The man leaned back in his chair and pointed to the screen.&#xA0;</span><span>The headline was &#x2018;Shocking Heaven and Earth Clan.&#x2019; It was a coverage about the Heaven and Earth Clan&#x2019;s crime.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;It is a scary world. Drugs to put people into a game world.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Yes. Their actions have eventually come back to them.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Ian told the Rehabilitation Brothers the information he received from Rommel.&#xA0;</span><span>Then Edgar&#x2019;s former lover, Robina, reported it to the police, and the prosecution started working with the Rehabilitation Brothers.</span></p><p><span>The &#x2018;sleeping room&#x2019; was formerly a workshop. There, they were able to find countless people who had disappeared, and Edgar was also rescued.&#xA0;</span><span>They had started voluntarily for money. However, they testified that they hadn&#x2019;t been able to quit even if they wanted to as they were subjected to intimidation.</span></p><p><span>&#x2018;Keynes&#x2019; Choi Sunggil, who planned all of this, and his right-hand man, &#x2018;Luin&#x2019; Kim Hyunchul, were arrested.&#xA0;</span><span>Public opinion turned against them.&#xA0;</span><span>The Heaven and Earth Clan turned from South Korea&#x2019;s pride to their disgrace.&#xA0;</span><span>The overseas community was also shocked at this situation, and it was a rude awakening for some people.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;What happened to Rommel?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;I don&#x2019;t think it will be hard to check if he participated or not.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;He was the commander? Right?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;That&#x2019;s correct. The War Maestro.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;How was it? Is he like the rumors say?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;He was definitely great...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Ian stopped talking.&#xA0;</span><span>He looked at the man.&#xA0;</span><span>The man smiled at him quietly. He looked to be in his mid-30s, and the glasses gave him an intelligent air.&#xA0;</span><span>The man&#x2019;s black eyes seemed to pierce through Ian.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;What did you say?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>The man chuckled.</span></p><p><span>Ian leaned back in his chair. His mind felt like a mess as he opened his mouth,&#xA0;</span><span>&#x201C;You...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;It has arrived. Please enjoy.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>At that moment, the employee served the beer, and the conversation between Ian and the man was suddenly halted.&#xA0;</span><span>The employee put a beer down in front of both of them. There were cold water droplets on the surface of the bottle, and Ian touched it with his fingers.</span></p><p><span>Then the employee went away.&#xA0;</span><span>Ian sipped the beer. It was cool, and he felt his mind calm down.</span></p><p><span>The man also drank his beer. Then he asked Ian,&#xA0;</span><span>&#x201C;How was Rommel, Crockta?&#x201D;</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p><p><a href="www.wuxiaworld.com">Glossary of Common Korean Terms.</a></p><p>Praise the Orc:&#xA0;<a href="docs.google.com">Glossary Link.&#xA0;</a></p><p>Current schedule:&#xA0;There will now be 14 chapters a week, meaning two chapters every day.</p><p>I have also updated my&#xA0;<a href="www.patreon.com">Patreon</a>&#xA0;to reflect my new novels.
