<p><span>Chapter 3 - Maker&#x2019;s Mistake (2)</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p><p><span>As Ian approached the wall, two orcs in chain armor stood tall like stone statues.&#xA0;</span><span>Their blades flashed in the sun.</span></p><p><span>They discovered Ian and laughed. They were laughing, but due to their tusks and their heinous appearance, their faces seemed evil.</span></p><p><span>&quot;Hey, are you alive?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;I&#x2019;m alive. I came here to become a fellow warrior.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>They burst out laughing. It was a unique tone caused by their stomachs shaking.&#xA0;</span><span>Ian gulped at their overwhelming momentum.&#xA0;</span><span>He had once been a soldier, but he couldn&#x2019;t help but shrink back at the two monstrous orcs side by side.</span></p><p><span>One of the orcs held out a fist.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;...?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Ian looked at the rough hand blankly before realizing it was a greeting. Ian also made a fist and bumped it against each other.&#xA0;</span><span>The orc guard smiled and said,</span></p><p><span>&quot;Anyway, you have arrived at Orcrox and I wish you good luck. Today there is a funeral where we will remember an honorable warrior. Kulkul. Stay alive.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>They shouted to open the door.&#xA0;</span><span>The walls were high enough to cover the sun, and the giant door that was the size of the building started to slowly open.&#xA0;</span><span>The door opened with a thunderous sound and Ian was able to see the inside of Orcrox Fortress.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Ohh...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Ian thought of orcs as savage monsters, since their appearance alone was heinous.&#xA0;</span><span>But that wasn&apos;t it.&#xA0;</span><span>The scale of the buildings were different. There were tall buildings around the giant tree in the center, with bridges in the sky connecting each one.&#xA0;</span><span>Above his head, orcs were busy going to and fro.</span></p><p><span>It felt like the city of elves in a fantasy world!&#xA0;</span><span>There weren&#x2019;t just warriors with weapons or shamans with staffs, but various orcs, such as merchants, in order to form a civilization.</span></p><p><span>It was a magnificent landscape that was more realistic than reality.&#xA0;</span><span>The orc fortress filled Ian&#x2019;s view.</span></p><p><span>&quot;This is really a game...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Hey, you&#x2019;re alive. Are you new?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Passing orcs smiled at the stunned newcomer and held out their fists. Ian bumped them with his fists.</span></p><p><span>Whether he was alive or not, it didn&#x2019;t take long for him to realize that it was the orcs&#x2019; greeting. All of them asked each other if they were alive, meaning this was a place where life and death occurred often enough for it to become a greeting.</span></p><p><span>Ian didn&#x2019;t know what to do after entering Orcrox Fortress, so he checked the interface for beginners tips.</span></p><p><span>[If you selected an orc, can you really endure it?]</span></p><p><span>[If you are a beginner, look for Instructor Lenox at Orcrox Fortress.]</span></p><p><span>&quot;Lenox...?&quot;</span></p><p><span>It was at that moment.</span></p><p><span>&quot;Uh, a user? Wah, a real user?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>There was a loud and gruff voice, but the tone was light.&#xA0;</span><span>Ian turned his head and saw a shabby looking orc.</span></p><p><span>&quot;This is the first time I&#x2019;ve seen another beginner orc. It&#x2019;s nice to meet you!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>He tried to shake hands before grunting and putting out his fist like the other orcs. Ian smiled and bumped his fist.</span></p><p><span>&quot;Are you alive?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;I&#x2019;m alive. Haha, by the way, did you just start playing? What&#x2019;s your name? I&#x2019;m called Grom. I got it from a character in an old classic game.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Yes. I&apos;m Ian.&quot;</span></p><p><span>Ian nodded.&#xA0;</span><span>Ian then discovered something on the other person&#x2019;s forehead. A white star was shimmering in the middle of his forehead.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;That...?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;What?&quot;</span></p><p><span>Grom followed Ian&#x2019;s gaze to his forehead.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Ah, this. You don&apos;t know? The white star allows you to identity the users. Ian has one on your forehead as well. That&#x2019;s how I knew that you were a user. NPC&#x2019;s can&#x2019;t see it, only we can. This is really the first time I&#x2019;ve seen it.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Is that so?&quot;</span></p><p><span>&quot;There are even some who hide it to pretend to be NPCs. You must have really started without investigating anything.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;This is the first time I&#x2019;m playing a game.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;I see. Be careful, this is a big deal. Elder Lord is a really hard game so you should look at the tips.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>He nodded and smiled.</span></p><p><span>&quot;Of course, you didn&#x2019;t see it, which is why you picked an orc.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Huh?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;It&apos;s nothing. Are you going to see Lenox?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;That is what the tip said.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Let&#x2019;s go together. I was about to start heading there now.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Ian followed Grom.</span></p><p><span>Ian was immersed in the sight of the city. Orcrox Fortress was filled with all types of things.&#xA0;</span><span>There was a market and smithy. It was a realistic scene that couldn&#x2019;t be thought of as a game as merchants shouted about their goods, adventurers gathered to fight monsters and orcs drank alcohol.</span></p><p><span>Ian started to think differently of Elder Lord.&#xA0;</span><span>The game system seemed to have a personality and story for each character. A civilization and culture was created for the orcs.&#xA0;</span><span>It was a wonderful game.</span></p><p><span>As Ian immersed himself in the world of Elder Lord, Grom laughed.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Isn&#x2019;t it amazing?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Yes. I can&#x2019;t believe this is a game. How...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>He couldn&#x2019;t believe that what he was seeing, hearing and feeling now was a game.</span></p><p><span>&quot;Oh, there is a funeral.&quot;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Funeral?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Orcs are mourning the death of a great warrior. He was a great NPC who sacrificed himself to protect his allies.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Suddenly, the faint sound of a horn could be heard.</span></p><p><span>At that moment.&#xA0;</span><span>The entire Orcrox Fortress became quiet.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Ah...?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>All the orcs were silent. Even the merchants shouting at the market and the drunkards became silent.&#xA0;</span><span>The horn rang out slowly in the midst of this quiet.&#xA0;</span><span>All the orcs looked at the center of Orcrox Fortress.</span></p><p><span>There appeared to be an altar made of bricks with an orc body lying on top of firewood.&#xA0;</span><span>The orcs started humming in bold tones.&#xA0;</span><span>It was a thick, subdued tone, like the humming of the Tibetan monks. The entire Orcrox Fortress was filled with the beat of the funeral procession.</span></p><p><span>At the bottom of the altar, the orcs presiding over the funeral started to slowly beat the drums.&#xA0;</span><span>The sound of the horns and the drumming and humming of the orcs mixed together.&#xA0;</span><span>The warrior&#x2019;s body caught on fire, the flames consuming the body of the dead orc warrior. The orcs held a ceremony in remembrance of their own. </span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Ah...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Ian was shocked.</span></p><p><span>A ceremony to honor their comrades.</span></p><p><span>He was reminded of a soldier on the battlefield. Cornell had become a star in the sky due to rebel bullets, and his colleagues had sent him away with bright smiles instead of sad tears. The song chosen wasn&#x2019;t a tranquil song, but an army song. Nobody cried that day, but their hearts and minds were overflowing with hot and sad emotions.</span></p><p><span>The memory of that day was revived.</span></p><p><span>The humming of the orcs was grand and noble. Ian couldn&#x2019;t take his eyes off the burning orc warrior.&#xA0;</span><span>The mournful cry of the horns wandered throughout Orcrox Fortress.</span></p><p><span>Ian didn&#x2019;t know the name of the orc, since he was just a character in the game. However, it is clear to Ian that he was a great and respected man.</span></p><p><span>&quot;Ah, noisy.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Ian&#x2019;s mind snapped back at Grom&#x2019;s words. Grom was grumbling beside him.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;A funeral should proceed quickly and quietly. Ahyu. Right?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Ian looked at him blankly.</span></p><p><span>Did this person really feel no emotions when seeing this scene?&#xA0;</span><span>In a world that seemed more real than reality, could he throw away the solemn ceremony of the orcs just because it was a game?</span></p><p><span>Ian turned his gaze once again to the burning body of the orc warrior.</span></p><p><span>[Assimilation: 50%]</span></p><p><span>[Assimilation: 51%]</span></p><p><span>[Assimilation: 52%]</span></p><p><span>......</span></p><p><span>Ian didn&#x2019;t know about the changes in his status window.</span></p><p></p><p style="text-align: center"><span>***</span></p><p></p><p><span>-Hello! I am a helper to help you live a comfortable Elder Lord life, Yoojung!</span></p><p><span>-I am Jaehan!</span></p><p><span>-Today we will talk about assimilation rate. Jaehan-ssi, what is your current assimilation rate?</span></p><p><span>-When my condition is good, it is over 50%. On average, it is 40%.</span></p><p><span>-That is amazing. I am usually 30%. An average user is between 30~40%, so Jaehan-ssi is capable.</span></p><p><span>-Hahaha. Still, I don&#x2019;t want to get hurt when fighting, so I often end up limiting it. At 50%, I feel dizzy like I am actually hit by a knife.</span></p><p><span>-In fact, I usually play at a limit of 20% due to that.</span></p><p><span>-Oh, that is worse.</span></p><p><span>-Hihihi. Anyway, what is the assimilation rate of the viewers? The survey results say that the average is between 30~40%. In the case of high rankers, especially those who are role-playing, it may be up to 70%.</span></p><p><span>-Amazing, don&#x2019;t they seem to be properly immersed? </span></p><p><i><span>Tremble tremble.</span></i></p><p><span>-In particular, the most popular roleplayer, user Kim Dalkwang of the militia, has released his latest status window. His assimilation rate is a huge 73%.</span></p><p><span>-Whoa! Is that how he became a ranker?</span></p><p><span>-The game publishers didn&#x2019;t disclose how the assimilation rate affects performance, but it certainly has an effect. It is common sense that rankers have a higher rate of assimilation, since the assimilation rate determines the ranker&#x2019;s abilities. Their skills, attacks and movements are superior in every way. Doesn&#x2019;t this narrow down the difference between NPC&#x2019;s and users?</span></p><p><span>-Ah, scary NPCs! I don&#x2019;t like NPCs!</span></p><p><span>-Haha. Is that so? That is why users are attempting to create a village! I interviewed Elaine, an elf user who designed Shangri-la, the village of users...</span></p><p><span>A restaurant staff member changed the television channel.</span></p><p><span>&quot;Eh, the world is going crazy for games...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Jung Yiyu, who was immersed in the contents, recovered. Her friends who she was eating together with also turned their heads away.</span></p><p><span>&quot;What is your assimilation rate?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;I&#x2019;m around 20~30%?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;I&apos;ve gone over 40% but I&#x2019;m usually around 30%.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Jung Yiyu laughed,&#xA0;</span><span>&#x201C;I am 10%!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Hey, what is this?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Do you only play with the right side of your brain while the left side is sleeping?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;It&#x2019;s a game. The thought of it being a game keeps me from being immersed... Well, I did level up.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;You died to a rabbit.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;What? How did a rabbit kill you? Is that possible? Do rabbits even attack?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Yiyu sighed.</span></p><p><span>&quot;I don&apos;t know. I tried to attack it, but the rabbit bit my legs. I was constantly bitten by the rabbit and died from severe bleeding.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Amazing.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Crazy...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Jung Yiyu laughed.</span></p><p><span>&quot;But don&#x2019;t worry. Now my troubles are over, since my brother has started playing the game.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Ah, that brother?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Yes. Oppa will become a high ranker quickly and take care of me. I will catch up to all of you.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>A friend who was listening interrupted her, &quot;Why will he become a high ranker?&quot;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;My brother is a soldier.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Soldier?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Will a soldier be more familiar with something like Elder Lord?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;There are plenty of army men.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;He was in a real battlefield, not a normal soldier. Do you know the foreign troops? He shot people in the Middle East and Africa.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Really? Then he has killed people?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Everyone&#x2019;s gaze turned to Yiyu, who shrugged.</span></p><p><span>&quot;I don&apos;t know, he doesn&#x2019;t talk about it...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Amazing. A friend of my brother&#x2019;s is a martial arts player and adapted immediately. Isn&#x2019;t he a ranker now?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Hey, Jung Yiyu. Don&apos;t pretend not to know me later.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Yiyu shrugged at her friends.</span></p><p><span>&quot;So be good to me.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>However, Yiyu didn&#x2019;t know one important thing about Ian, whom she was putting all of her expectations in.</span></p><p><span>He chose the orc that was called the game maker&#x2019;s mistake.</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p><p>I have a&#xA0;<a href="www.wuxiaworld.com">Glossary of Common Korean Terms</a>&#xA0;for any unfamiliar honourifics or other Korean elements that you might be unfamiliar with.</p><p>My editor Superposhposh also created a glossary to keep track of everything.
