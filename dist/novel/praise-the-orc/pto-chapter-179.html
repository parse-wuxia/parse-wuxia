<p><span>Chapter 179 - Hedor&#x2019;s Legacy (1)</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p><p><span>&#x201C;Something is wrong.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Yes, we can&#x2019;t stay still.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Gather the magicians. What about you?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;My job has ended.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Let us begin as soon as possible. Time is running out.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Right.&#x201D;</span></p><p></p><p style="text-align: center"><span>***</span></p><p></p><p><span>Katalu had changed during Crockta&#x2019;s absence.&#xA0;</span><span>The preparations for war had disappeared, and it seemed to revive into a lively city.</span></p><p><span>Crockta walked through the bustling market with Tiyo, then he found a store and slowed down.&#xA0;</span><span>It was a vegetable store.&#xA0;</span><span>Old memories suddenly popped into his head.&#xA0;</span><span>At one time, he had sold vegetables. He had helped Stella sell vegetables in Anail.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;That man, he is fairly good.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;He can sell a fireplace to people in the desert <em>dot</em>.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>The vegetable seller was brilliant at dealing with customers. He stopped the guests, formed an affinity with them, and sold them a handful of vegetables.&#xA0;</span><span>As Crockta and Tiyo were admiring his skills, there was a sudden commotion.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Look, I don&#x2019;t eat vegetables.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span><span>A man stood in front of the vegetable store, playing with the vegetables while laughing.&#xA0;</span><span>&#x201C;We aren&#x2019;t herbivores. Do you think eating vegetables can make you strong?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>The man raised his arms and showed off his biceps. The muscles of his right arm bulged out.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;You can become strong like me by eating meat.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>The demonstration of his body stopped the crowd. The burly man shrugged and laughed at the vegetable seller.&#xA0;</span><span>&#x201C;Look, Mister Vegetable Seller, are you going to collapse right now? You are as skinny as a dried anchovy. Eating vegetables have weakened you.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Meat is good, but you need to eat a balanced meal for nutrition...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Balanced, balanced! I am tired of hearing this! I grew up hearing that I would be taller if I eat bean sprouts and stronger if I eat spinach! But then I was incredibly weak! Everything is a lie!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>As he screamed, a few customers turned away from the vegetable store. The vegetable seller&#x2019;s expression turned grouchy.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;You should talk about this somewhere else...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Eat meat! Chicken breast! Pork sirloin! Pork tenderloin! Pork forelock! Beef if you are rich! That is how our muscles develop!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>He took off his top and posed again.&#xA0;</span><span>The man had good muscles.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;That&#x2026; Amazing.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Oh my, oh my, look.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>The men in the market were amazed by the muscles, while the women covered their eyes and peeked through their fingers.</span></p><p><span>The man smiled and shouted,&#xA0;</span><span>&#x201C;If you want to be like me, come to Arnold&#x2019;s Butchery!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;......!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>It was an explicit publicity stunt!&#xA0;</span><span>Crockta realized something. This person was almost certainly employed by Arnold&#x2019;s Butchery.&#xA0;</span><span>The man deceived people with his good muscles. Why else would he discuss here while showing off his chest, triceps, and biceps!</span></p><p><span>The customers at the vegetable store turned away one by one. Then they asked the man,&#xA0;</span><span>&#x201C;Where is Arnold&#x2019;s Butchery?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Hahat! Arnold&#x2019;s butcher store can be found on the right side if you turn left at that corner! There is a discount for the pork tenderloin today!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>The atmosphere was already in his favor. People decided that today&#x2019;s dinner menu was going to be meat.&#xA0;</span><span>The vegetable seller&#x2019;s head drooped down.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;It is sophistry&#x2026; Without vegetables&#x2026; people can&#x2019;t live...!&#x201D;&#xA0;</span><span>However, his voice didn&#x2019;t reach the people.</span></p><p><span>Crockta looked at him and closed his eyes.&#xA0;</span><span>Obviously, meat and proteins were important.&#xA0;</span><span>However, the value of vegetables couldn&#x2019;t be discounted.&#xA0;</span><span>Proteins were important, but the vitamins, antioxidants, and anti-cancer compounds as well as various minerals and phytochemicals were essential for the body&#x2019;s health.</span></p><p><span>Crockta opened his eyes and stepped forward.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;......!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>The people were surprised at the sudden emergence of an orc warrior. The muscular man posing flinched as well.&#xA0;</span><span>Who didn&#x2019;t know of Crockta, the true hero who saved Katalu?!</span></p><p><span>Crockta looked at the muscular man with sunken eyes. The man winced and hopelessly maintained his pose.&#xA0;</span><span>The muscular man looked like a dwarf once Crockta stood next to him.</span></p><p><span>He awkwardly smiled at Crockta.&#xA0;</span><span>&#x201C;Hahaha, it is Crockta. Your body is also good. Crockta eats a lot of meat right? Hahat! Take a look at these muscles! You must eat three chicken breasts every meal! Kelkelkel! Crockta as well!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Crockta didn&apos;t answer.&#xA0;</span><span>A person&#x2019;s beliefs weren&#x2019;t shown through words but actions.</span></p><p><span>Crockta spoke to the vegetable seller,&#xA0;</span><span>&#x201C;Hey.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>The vegetable seller stuttered with confusion,&#xA0;</span><span>&#x201C;Y-Yes?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;The spinach, how much is it?&#x201D;&#xA0;</span><span>Crockta grinned.&#xA0;</span><span>&#x201C;I would like to buy some.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;......!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Spinach...!&#xA0;</span><span>It was rated as one of the top 10 superfoods in the world. He might have a rough green body, but he was devoted to eating spinach since it had various beneficial properties.&#xA0;</span><span>Crockta declared that he would buy it all.&#xA0;</span><span>The marketplace became noisy.</span></p><p><span>Then Crockta said,&#xA0;</span><span>&#x201C;Hey, inflatable muscles.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;......!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>The man&#x2019;s face turned blue. &#x2018;Inflatable muscles&#x2019; was an unbearable insult to him.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Look.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Crockta gave strength to his arm...</span></p><p><span>And it swelled greatly.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;This is the ultimate compression muscle.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Cries of admiration emerged from the crowd.&#xA0;</span><span>If the compressed muscles were so big, what were the decompressed muscles like?&#xA0;</span><span>The man wanted to protest that Crockta&#x2019;s muscles were inflated, but the atmosphere was also on Crockta&#x2019;s side.</span></p><p><span>No, Crockta&#x2019;s compressed muscles were bigger than the man&#x2019;s.</span></p><p><span>Crockta stated,&#xA0;</span><span>&#x201C;Meat is definitely important. However, you aren&#x2019;t a real muscle man if you don&#x2019;t know the value of vegetables.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;T-That...!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Tell me, what did you eat this morning?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;That...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>The man didn&#x2019;t answer. Crockta demanded harshly,</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Tell me!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;......!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Your body doesn&apos;t lie! What did you eat this morning?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>The man gulped at Crockta&#x2019;s push.&#xA0;</span><span>Crockta stared at him. Confronted with the gazes of Crockta and the crowd staring at him, the silent man was forced to open his mouth.</span></p><p><span>He gritted his teeth and replied,&#xA0;</span><span>&#x201C;Of course, it is chicken breast...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;And?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;......&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Crockta looked down at him and asked,&#xA0;</span><span>&#x201C;What else did you eat?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>The man lowered his head. Then he spoke in a small voice,&#xA0;</span><span>&#x201C;Boiled sweet potato...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;......!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>The people were shocked, but Crockta didn&#x2019;t stop there.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;And?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Kuock...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;What else did you eat?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Cabbage salad with tomatoes and blackberries...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Sweet potatoes, cabbages, tomatoes, and blackberries!&#xA0;</span><span>He didn&#x2019;t hate vegetables!</span></p><p><span>As a man who loved physical beauty, he knew the importance of a balanced diet.&#xA0;</span><span>He used his body to be hired by Arnold&#x2019;s Butchery, deceiving people for publicity and preaching false beliefs. However, before Crockta&#x2019;s questioning and doubts, he had to tell the truth.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;That&apos;s right. Say it again. Do vegetables not matter?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Vegetables...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Crockta urged him on,&#xA0;</span><span>&#x201C;Aren&#x2019;t they really important?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>The man decided to admit defeat. He couldn&#x2019;t fool himself any longer.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;They are important...!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>He finally revealed his heart.&#xA0;</span><span>Vegetables...&#xA0;</span><span>They were important.</span></p><p><span>The man&#x2019;s head drooped down.&#xA0;</span><span>It was a declaration of defeat.</span></p><p><i><span>Clap.</span></i> <i><span>Clap.</span></i> <i><span>Clap.</span></i></p><p><span>The people watching the spectacle started to clap and chant Crockta&apos;s name.&#xA0;</span><span>Crockta had preserved the honor of vegetables.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Kuock...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>The man looked down with shame.&#xA0;</span><span>He was embarrassed about deceiving himself for money. Since this happened, he wouldn&#x2019;t be paid by Arnold anymore.&#xA0;</span><span>The man had become someone who didn&#x2019;t have money nor honor.&#xA0;</span><span>He fell into shame.</span></p><p><span>Suddenly, a thick hand grabbed his shoulder. It was Crockta.</span></p><p><span>Crockta spoke with a merciful face,&#xA0;</span><span>&#x201C;Hey.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;......&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;It was a joke. You have very nice muscles.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;......!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>The man looked at Crockta with quivering eyes. Crockta&#x2019;s expression was warm as he genuinely admired the man&#x2019;s body.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;I previously called you inflatable muscles...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;I said I didn&#x2019;t need vegetables.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Crockta showed off his tough biceps and said,&#xA0;</span><span>&#x201C;Next time, let&#x2019;s lift weights together.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>The man received Crockta&#x2019;s recognition...!&#xA0;</span><span>Crockta recognized the time and effort he&#x2019;d put into building his muscles. The man was filled with great emotions, and he touched his nose, shrugging in a show of bravado.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;My training is harsh. It is hell training.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Right. That is natural.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;......&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;You must&#x2019;ve overcome hard times.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>The man was overwhelmed.&#xA0;</span><span>They weren&#x2019;t just comforting words because Crockta truly understood.&#xA0;</span><span>Crockta reached out his hand, and the man responded. The two men embraced.&#xA0;</span><span>The two muscular men forgave each other&#x2019;s mistakes.</span></p><p><span>Then people flocked to the vegetable store.&#xA0;</span><span>The vegetable store was recognized by Crockta!</span></p><p><span>Having a healthy body which could live a long time was people&#x2019;s dream. The people who saw such a future bought the vegetables from this store.&#xA0;</span><span>Like this, the vegetable store became well-known because of Crockta.</span></p><p><span>The muscle man restored his courage and spoke to Tiyo, who was standing quietly beside Crockta.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Tiyo as well. You should buy some vegetables. How can you accompany Crockta with a body like that? Kelkelkel!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Kulkulkul, kulkulkul!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Crockta laughed together with the man.</span></p><p><span>Tiyo frowned.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;What did you say <em>dot</em>!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;You should gain some muscles. Kelkelkel!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;That&#x2019;s right. Kulkulkulkul!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Kelkelkelkel!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>The two muscular men laughed at Tiyo, while Tiyo&#x2019;s eyebrows twitched. His gnome&#x2019;s pride couldn&#x2019;t allow this.&#xA0;</span><span>Tiyo jumped forward.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Achu!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>He spun like a spinning top and kicked.&#xA0;</span><span>They were lightning fast strikes aimed at Crockta&#x2019;s and the man&#x2019;s jaws.&#xA0;</span><span>Crockta barely escaped, but the man failed and was hit in the jaw.&#xA0;</span><span>It was only a light hit, but the man swayed and sat down.&#xA0;</span><span>The man couldn&#x2019;t easily recover from the damage and sat for a while.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Uhhh...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Look, inflatable muscles dot! This is the truly ultimate compression muscle dot!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Tiyo took off his top...</span></p><p><span>And his upper body was revealed.&#xA0;</span><span>His body contained tight muscles, with no signs of fat anywhere. It was reminiscent of Bruce Lee.&#xA0;</span><span>While wearing clothes, he looked like a child, but once they were thrown off, dense and compact muscles were revealed.&#xA0;</span><span>It was a perfect and slim figure that wasn&#x2019;t lacking in anything.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;This...!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Beautiful...!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>People admired him.&#xA0;</span><span>The vegetable seller also clapped.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Watching Tiyo, I am reminded of a gnome that I knew before.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;What <em>dot</em>? There was another wonderful gnome <em>dot</em>?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;That&apos;s right. The gnome loved eating spinach when he stayed in Katalu. His body was as dazzling as Tiyo&#x2019;s.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span><span>The vegetable seller&#x2019;s gaze became distant.&#xA0;</span><span>&#x201C;His name was Hedor! A cool gnome.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;......!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;...Hedor!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Crockta and Tiyo&#x2019;s eyes widened.</span></p><p><span>Hedor.&#xA0;</span><span>It was Tiyo&#x2019;s father, whom they were looking for.&#xA0;</span><span>They got a clue about Hedor at the vegetable store.</span></p><p></p><p style="text-align: center"><span>***</span></p><p></p><p><span>Crockta&#x2019;s popularity meant there were fans and followers tracking his every move.&#xA0;</span><span>The movements were often ordinary, but Crockta didn&#x2019;t avoid or tell them off.&#xA0;</span><span>This was the reason why...</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;You came because you want a nice body...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Yes.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Baek Hanho was troubled as the number of people joining his gym increased.&#xA0;</span><span>More members was a good thing.&#xA0;</span><span>However, most of them said strange things during the first consultation.</span></p><p><span>Baek Hanho looked at the form submitted by the applicants and sighed.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Yes, I would like the same ultimate muscles as Tiyo.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;That&#x2019;s right!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;There is someone who wants muscles like Crockta?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Yes. I want to become stronger like Crockta!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>The three men sitting side by side looked at Baek Hanho with firm eyes.&#xA0;</span><span>The remaining silent person suddenly said,&#xA0;</span><span>&#x201C;I want to be like the butcher shop meat man. I don&#x2019;t have unrealistic goals like them.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>The man who interfered with the vegetable seller&#x2019;s business was known on the Internet as the butcher shop meat man.&#xA0;</span><span>His meat praising character was surprisingly popular, and there were those who started exercising with the goal of being like him.</span></p><p><span>The new muscular craze...</span></p><p><span>Crockta&#x2019;s popularity led to trends in reality.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;......&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Baek Hanho hit his forehead with his pen. He thought for a moment before opening his mouth.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Hrmm... What about a body like Andre&#x2019;s?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Andre?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>They shook their heads in unison.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Aish. What is Andre?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;He is too strange.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Crockta is the trend. Andre, yuck.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Baek Hanho nodded. &#xA0;</span><span>&#x201C;Right. Today, let&#x2019;s start straight away. Change your clothes.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Huh? We were going to start tomorrow...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;I have an appointment...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Shut up. He who lives for tomorrow won&#x2019;t be able to defeat his enemies today! Take it off right now!&#x201D;&#xA0;</span><span>Baek Hanho&#x2019;s eyes blazed passionately.&#xA0;</span><span>&#x201C;I&#x2019;ll make those bodies... through hell training.&#x201D;</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p><p><a href="www.wuxiaworld.com">Glossary of Common Korean Terms.</a></p><p>Praise the Orc:&#xA0;<a href="docs.google.com">Glossary Link.&#xA0;</a></p><p>Current schedule:&#xA0;There will now be 14 chapters a week, meaning two chapters every day.</p><p>I have also updated my&#xA0;<a href="www.patreon.com">Patreon</a>&#xA0;to reflect my new novels.
