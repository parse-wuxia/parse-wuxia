<p><span>Chapter 13 - User Hunters (2)</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p><p><span>A cross-section of the woman&#x2019;s body was revealed as her parts fell to either side.&#xA0;</span><span>The man screamed at the gory sight.</span></p><p><span>&quot;Eri! Eri...!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Anybody who fought in Elder Lord would have a brutal battle.&#xA0;</span><span>There was a reason why Elder Lord was an adult game.</span></p><p><span>However, Ian wasn&#x2019;t concerned, despite being the person involved. He just admired the realistic representation of the human body.&#xA0;</span><span>He looked at the sword that was stuck in his abdomen.&#xA0;</span><span>He would leave it alone and get rid of the other guy first. Ian lifted his bloody greatsword, it&apos;s shadow covering the face of the spear user.</span></p><p><span>The man lost his strength and flopped down.&#xA0;</span><span>Then he whispered.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;As much as possible...no pain...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Ian nodded and swung his sword straight downwards.&#xA0;</span><span>His first PK experience in Elder Lord had ended with his victory.</span></p><p><span>[You have gotten rid of all the assailants.]</span></p><p><span>[200 achievement points have been acquired.]</span></p><p><span>[Your level has risen.]</span></p><p><span>[Orc&#x2019;s Recovery (Common) has been used.]</span></p><p><span>[You have recovered from countless wounds suffered in many battles.</span></p><p><span>[Orc&#x2019;s Recovery (Common) has been promoted to Orc&#x2019;s Vitality (Uncommon)].</span></p><p><span>[There is a short sword stuck in your abdomen. It will be dangerous if left untreated.]</span></p><p><span>[Status Window]</span></p><p><span>&#x2018;Friend of Farmers&#x2019; Ian, Orc Apprentice Warrior</span></p><p><span>Level: 6</span></p><p><span>Achievement Points: 330</span></p><p><span>Assimilation: 57%</span></p><p><span>Abilities: </span></p><p><span>Orc&apos;s Superhuman Strength (Uncommon)</span></p><p><span>Orc&apos;s Vitality (Uncommon)</span></p><p><span>Orc&#x2019;s Greatsword Technique (Uncommon)</span></p><p><span>Warrior&apos;s Fighting Spirit (Uncommon)</span></p><p><span>Two of his skills had been upgraded after taking care of the users. &#xA0;It made sense why these guys hunted users.&#xA0;</span><span>The bodies of the dead users turned into white particles, drifting like dandelion seeds in the wind, until they couldn&#x2019;t be seen anymore.</span></p><p><span>The three bodies of the men and woman disappeared, leaving only their equipment behind.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;...Are these mine now?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>This was another reason to hunt other users.</span></p><p><span>Ian pulled out the sword stuck in his abdomen. He swallowed back the pain and bandaged the wounds with the clothes of the user hunters.&#xA0;</span><span>He scanned the equipment and found nothing special. They were the ordinary clothes and weapons sold at the blacksmiths. All of them had the Common rating.</span></p><p><span>He grabbed the spear, the swords, and the staff, since they could be sold. Ian and raised his head and saw an empty, vacant lot. There was no one here.</span></p><p><span>The battle was over.&#xA0;</span><span>Ian felt something unfamiliar swelling up inside him.&#xA0;</span><span>He had defeated criminals in Elder Lord.</span></p><p><span>Ian murmured to himself, &#xA0;&quot;Today, I met three wicked people and killed them, implementing justice.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>An orc who knew honor!</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Where are the people who know honor?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>The orc who fought against injustice!</span></p><p><span>Great.&#xA0;</span><span>It was like a scene from a movie.&#xA0;</span><span>However, he felt strangely ashamed. Ian&apos;s face turned red, moving quickly in case someone had heard him. Soon after Ian&#x2019;s figure disappeared.&#xA0;</span><span>Only the clothing of the assailants remained in the back alley of Anail.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;...Amazing.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Then a woman walked out from the shadows.&#xA0;</span><span>She was a woman wearing all black, with a mask covering her face. The tight clothes revealed her alluring body.</span></p><p><span>&quot;I came to cover the user hunters, only to hit a jackpot.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>She looked at the place where the assailants were.</span></p><p><span>Jackson. Brown. Eri. They were user hunters active in the Anail area, and were known to attack anyone, regardless of whether they were beginners or not.&#xA0;</span><span>They used a friendly approach to get close to the user, only to stab them in the back and gain their items and achievement points.&#xA0;</span><span>They aimed solely at users that weren&#x2019;t familiar with combat. Therefore, there were complaints about the trio of killers.</span></p><p><span>However, they hit an orc NPC by accident and suffered.</span></p><p><span>The battle scene was amazing.&#xA0;</span><span>A boldness that the users couldn&#x2019;t follow! A cruelty that wasn&#x2019;t afraid of blood! The decisiveness of his attacks!&#xA0;</span><span>A soliloquy after the battle ended!</span></p><p><span>She came up with a title for her video.</span></p><p><span>&quot;The mannerless user hunters, justice is implemented!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Their bad behavior had already been uploaded. The scenes of them ambushing a user, only to be killed, would be an explosive hit.&#xA0;</span><span>She didn&#x2019;t know why, but it seemed like they had mistaken the NPC for a user.</span></p><p><span>She nodded as she checked the video that she recorded.&#xA0;</span><span>People would go crazy over it. The sight of wicked people forgetting themselves and falling into the pit of hell.&#xA0;</span><span>There was even a nice soliloquy of justice!</span></p><p><span>She glanced around as she ended the connection.</span></p><p></p><p style="text-align: center"><span>***</span></p><p></p><p><span>Park Jungtae smiled as he heard Yiyu&#x2019;s voice next to him.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Hey, Park Jungtae. What level are you?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;I don&#x2019;t have a capsule.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Then go to a capsule room.</span></p><p><span>&quot;Stop playing the game and focus on your life. Didn&#x2019;t you do badly on the exam?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Wow, how cowardly to attack with that fact.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>The two were sitting in a cafe on campus. After their economics lecture ended, they decided to spend some time together.&#xA0;</span><span>As the two of them were talking, someone called out Yiyu&#x2019;s name.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Ah, Yiyu! Jung Yiyu!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Park Jungtae as well?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>A group of girls rushed over and sat at their table.</span></p><p><span>&quot;What are the two of you doing?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Isn&#x2019;t this strange? Perhaps? Jungtae, wow~ Park Jungtae, not bad~.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Yiyu laughed, &quot;If you are just here to talk nonsense, then leave.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Isn&#x2019;t that too harsh? Do you want me to keep calling you Rabbit? Didn&#x2019;t a rabbit give you a hard time?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Ah, noisy.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>After Yiyu died from a rabbit in Elder Lord, her friends kept on calling her Rabbit.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;By the way, have you seen it?&#x201D; Her friend asked.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;What?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Youvidser Laney&#x2019;s video.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Youvidser. Youvids was the world&#x2019;s largest video upload site, and its content creators were called Youvidsers. Of course, even in Youvids, most of the mainstream content was related to Elder Lord.</span></p><p><span>Laney was a star who emerged after reporting on various types of wicked players, filming their wickedness in gruesome detail.&#xA0;</span><span>Rumor has it that the users captured on video weren&#x2019;t even aware of Laney&#x2019;s existence because she was such a high level assassin.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Seen what?&#x201D; Yiyu asked.</span></p><p><span>&quot;Look look, it is a bit hit. The three user hunters humiliation video.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>She pulled out her tablet. Yiyu, Park Jungtae and her friends focused on the tablet.</span></p><p><span>[Laney&#x2019;s &#x2018;Justice is implemented on the user hunters.&#x2019;]</span></p><p><span>The opening scene was of three users chuckling with one orc standing in front of them.&#xA0;</span><span>Laney edited the caption.</span></p><p><span>[The mannerless user hunters, they&#x2019;ve found an orc user!]</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Orc? An orc user?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Keep watching.&quot;</span></p><p><span>[As usual, they are trying to ambush the user....]</span></p><p><span>They laughed as the orc hesitated.&#xA0;</span><span>But after a short moment, the orc rushed and instantly cut off the magician&#x2019;s head.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Whoa.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Isn&#x2019;t that crazy?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>The dismay on the user hunters&#x2019; faces was caught on the screen.</span></p><p><span>[But ding! That is incorrect! An NPC!]</span></p><p><span>It became a 2 vs 1 fight.&#xA0;</span><span>The user hunters were familiar with fighting, so they attacked the orc pretty well. The orc went on the defensive.</span></p><p><span>&quot;Isn&#x2019;t the orc losing?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;It is coming soon.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>At that time, the woman stabbed the orc with a short sword.&#xA0;</span><span>The orc was waiting for that moment and cut the female hunter&#x2019;s torso.&#xA0;</span><span>The user hunter&#x2019;s body was split in half.</span></p><p><span>Yiyu flinched as she watched the brutal scene.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;I can see the flesh and bones.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Park Jungtae admired the sight.&#xA0;</span><span>The woman&#x2019;s body was broken and the lone spearman soon fell down. He whispered something to the orc and the orc nodded.&#xA0;</span><span>Then he beheaded the user.</span></p><p><span>3 vs 1!&#xA0;</span><span>Their power didn&#x2019;t differ much. Rather, the user hunters were superior in power. However, the skill and the boldness of the orc overwhelmed them.&#xA0;</span><span>It was truly a fierce battle!</span></p><p><span>&quot;This is why you shouldn&#x2019;t touch NPCs.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>The corpses of the users turned white and disappeared.&#xA0;</span><span>The orc grabbed their weapons and stood still.&#xA0;</span><span>The video didn&#x2019;t end there.</span></p><p><span>&quot;...There&#x2019;s more?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Listen carefully.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>The orc stood there, looking into the air.&#xA0;</span><span>Then the orc opened his mouth.</span></p><p><i><span>-Today, I met three wicked people and killed them, implementing justice.</span></i></p><p><span>The orc formed a fist.</span></p><p><i><span>-Where are the people who know honor?</span></i></p><p><span>It was a loud voice.&#xA0;</span><span>The orc disappeared into the darkness of the city after speaking.</span></p><p><span>Park Jungtae and Yiyu&#x2019;s mouths dropped open.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;...Amazing.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;...Really cool.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>An unknown spirit was blazing from him!&#xA0;</span><span>There was an explosion of comments.</span></p><p><span>&#x2514; Elder Lord&#x2019;s Path: I&#x2019;m going to become an orc.</span></p><p><span>&#xA0; &#x2514; Arigato: 222222. </span></p><p><span>&#xA0; &#x2514; I am the Best: 222222. </span></p><p><span>&#xA0; &#x2514; Cooking Fondant: 222222. </span></p><p><span>&#xA0; &#xA0;&#x2514;Woo In-sung&#x2019;s Secret: 2222&#x3160;&#x315C;</span></p><p><span>&#xA0; &#x2514; (View more)</span></p><p><span>&#x2514; My name is Yoda: We are going crazy;;;; Protect honor;;</span></p><p><span>&#x2514; Assassination King: I have to reevaluate hunting orc users.</span></p><p><span>&#x2514; Dragon Bra: It&#x2019;s just a staged scene &#x3139;&#x3147;</span></p><p><span>&#xA0; &#x2514; Ninano: He really seems like a NPC ;;; An orc who clears houses.</span></p><p><span>&#x2514; Orc Hunter: An orc is a mob.</span></p><p><span>&#xA0; &#x2514; Number 1 Orc User Maguchwi: Dirty humans!!

He was a blacksmith but he was busy with his part time job and school. It was tough to enjoy the game.</span></p><p><span>Soon, it was time for his next lecture. Park Jungtae got up.</span></p><p><span>&quot;I have to go.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Uh. Bye. See you tomorrow.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Jungtae, bai!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Bye!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Park Jungtae separated from the group and walked through the university.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Hey, Park Jungtae!</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Eh?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>A foreign car stopped on the side of the campus.&#xA0;</span><span>The car door opened and someone run towards him.&#xA0;</span><span>Park Jungtae&#x2019;s face distorted. It was the senior he got into a fight with over Yiyu.</span></p><p><span>The senior cried out, &quot;You, fuck, what did you do? Eh? What&#x2019;s going on?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;What?&quot;</span></p><p><span>&quot;I&apos;ll apologize, yes? Cancel everything, I&#x2019;ll pay for all your medical expenses.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;W-What?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;My father&#x2019;s company will be ruined!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Why are you telling me...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Using common sense, you&#x2019;re the only one! Why did the customers suddenly cancel their accounts! They have all abandoned our company! After we fought...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>His face was like he lost his soul. The senior didn&#x2019;t pay any attention to the gazes around him as he clung onto Jungtae.</span></p><p><span>Somebody popped into Park Jungtae&#x2019;s head at the words.&#xA0;</span><span>It was Yiyu&#x2019;s brother and the owner of Caf&#xE9; Reason, Jung Ian.</span></p><p><span>The senior cried out, &quot;I am acting like this, eh? I didn&#x2019;t know you were so strong. Really...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;No, Senior. I really don&#x2019;t know. Would I have a part time job if I could do that? I&#x2019;m trying to make a living.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Ah...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;I don&apos;t understand, but I hope it will be resolved. Now I have to go to a lecture.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Hey, agreement! Let&#x2019;s come to an agreement! Eh? I can write a memorandum. Write it now!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Now?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Yes, now.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Park Jungtae nodded.</span></p><p><span>&#x2018;Jungtae, I&apos;ll resolve it so don&apos;t worry.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span>As Ian said, Jungtae didn&#x2019;t know what happened, but everything was resolved.</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p><p><strong>TL Note:</strong> Youvid and Youvidser were specifically written by the author in English.
