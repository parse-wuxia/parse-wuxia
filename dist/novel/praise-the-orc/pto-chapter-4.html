<p><span>Chapter 4 - Instructor Lenox (1)</span></p><p><br></p><hr><p><br></p><p><span>&#xA0;&#x201C;Kuheook!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Ian fell to the ground.</span></p><p><span>The orc warrior, Instructor Lenox, laughed at them.</span></p><p><span>&quot;You guys came to become warriors?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Keooook...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Lenox grabbed Grom&#x2019;s neck.</span></p><p><span>&quot;You! Don&#x2019;t overrate yourselves! Orcs! Keep your head up!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Lenox pushed his face right up to theirs and shouted,</span></p><p><span>&quot;Look at these soft limbs! You aren&#x2019;t orcs! Humans! Elves! I can even believe that you are dwarves!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Lenox then threw Grom, who moaned as he rolled across the floor.&#xA0;</span><span>The orc warriors that were training laughed at them with their distinct voices.</span></p><p><span>When Ian and Grom first told Lenox that they wanted to be orc warriors, Lenox asked them,</span></p><p><span>&quot;Why do you want to be a warrior?&quot;</span></p><p><span>Ian and Grom looked at each other.&#xA0;</span>Grom replied within a minute,</p><p><span>&#x201C;I want to become stronger!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>The Orcs, a fighting species. They were strong warriors who worshiped fighters and never bowed to the enemy!&#xA0;</span><span>It was a textbook answer, and to some extent, it was true.</span></p><p><span>Lenox&#x2019;s eyes widened at Grom&#x2019;s response.&#xA0;</span>He nodded, and then punched Grom and Ian. <span>Now they were being beaten up.</span></p><p><span>&quot;Why, why are you doing this...?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Even if it was virtual reality, they still felt pain. The amount of sensation was deducted in accordance with one&#x2019;s assimilation rate, but the pain itself still existed.&#xA0;</span><span>Grom sounded like he was going to cry from the beating.&#xA0;</span><span>Lenox and the other orc warriors once again laughed at Grom&#x2019;s voice.</span></p><p><span>&quot;The sissy is crying now! That&#x2019;s it, meek orc!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Lenox raised his fist once again and Grom crouched down. Lenox smiled and put down his fist.</span></p><p><span>Then he turned and looked at Ian.&#xA0;</span><span>Ian was bracing himself while standing up. He shook due to the sense of pain that he had forgotten for a while. It really felt like he was being beaten. He started swaying.</span></p><p><span>&quot;Hey you! What about you?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Huh?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Did you come here because you wanted to become stronger like him?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Ian felt a sense of d&#xE9;j&#xE0; vu.</span></p><p><span>Lenox resembled the instructor of the foreign troops.&#xA0;</span><span>The instructor had asked the recruits, &#x2018;Why did you come here? What reason do you have for jumping into the firing line?&#x2019; &#xA0;</span><span>There were many answers, but the instructor just laughed and kicked them.</span></p><p><span>Then Ian replied,</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;To protect my younger sister.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Their parents had died, leaving no money and inherited debt. He had to protect his little sister. He, who only had a body that learned martial arts. He turned towards the battlefield.</span></p><p><span>The instructor had nodded at Ian&#x2019;s reply and kicked Ian in the stomach.</span></p><p><span>&quot;Do it well.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>The instructor had muttered softly instead of laughing.</span></p><p><span>As Ian recalled that time, he stared into Lenox&#x2019;s eyes.&#xA0;</span><span>Lenox no longer seemed like an ugly monster in a game. He was a warrior, an instructor. A mentor to the orc warriors. It wasn&#x2019;t the time to joke right now.</span></p><p><span>He stared straight into his eyes.&#xA0;</span><span>Lenox wasn&#x2019;t the type who required a typical answer in a game.</span></p><p><span>&quot;That&apos;s right.&quot;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Hoh.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Become stronger...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Ian said firmly.</span></p><p><span>&quot;To protect my precious people.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>He was sincere, Ian had truly started this game for Yiyu. He had learned on the battlefield that the world was a heavy place.&#xA0;</span><span>The wars were just a proxy for the politicians.</span></p><p><span>Lenox laughed at Ian&#x2019;s answer and then he slammed his fist into Ian&#x2019;s abdomen.</span></p><p><span>&quot;Heeok!&quot;</span></p><p><span>Ian clenched his teeth and persisted. His waist folded, but his legs didn&#x2019;t collapse.</span></p><p><span>&quot;Everybody get up.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Lenox&#x2019;s voice was heard and Grom stood up. The two people stood in front of Lenox.&#xA0;</span><span>Lenox looked at Grom first.</span></p><p><span>&quot;If you want to become stronger, never cower.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Yes, yes!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Straighten your waist.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Grom tightened his waist.&#xA0;</span><span>Then Lenox looked at Ian.</span></p><p><span>&quot;You want to protect your precious people?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;That&apos;s right.&quot;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Right now, you can&#x2019;t even protect yourself, let alone your precious people.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Lenox grinned.</span></p><p><span>&quot;Remember today&#x2019;s helplessness.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>[You have become an orc apprentice warrior!]</span></p><p><span>[Become a great orc warrior with the teachings of Instructor Lenox!]</span></p><p><span><span><a href="#footnote-10" id="footnoteref-10"></a></span></span></p><p>[One <span id="footnote-10">achievement point has been acquired!]</span></p><p><span>The message windows opened.&#xA0;</span><span>Grom looked like he had received the same messages.</span></p><p><span>Lenox made a gesture to follow him. They entered a large stone building that was beside the training grounds.</span></p><p><span>&quot;Anyone who wants to become a warrior will need to stop by here.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>He waved his hands and the dark interior lit up.</span></p><p><span>&quot;These are the great warriors who have entered the Hall of Fame.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>The lit torches revealed multiple statues surrounding them.&#xA0;</span><span>They were several times larger than actual orcs and were delicately sculpted to look as if they were alive.&#xA0;</span><span>Ian once again admired the level of civilization of the orcs.</span></p><p><span>The statues stood proudly with their weapons, including an axe, a hammer, a mace, and a morning star.&#xA0;</span><span>Lenox asked,</span></p><p><span>&quot;Who do you want to follow?&quot;</span></p><p><span>The message windows popped up.</span></p><p><span>[Please select your role model!]</span></p><p><span>[The orcs believe in intuition and following the pull of the soul.]</span></p><p><span>[Your weapon will depend on this choice.]</span></p><p><span>[The weapon can be changed at a later time, but for the time being, you will proceed with the weapon and skills that you have chosen.]</span></p><p><span>It seemed like they were now choosing their weapons.&#xA0;</span><span>Ian methodically examined the statues. The statues looked down at the center of the circle, making him feel like he was making eye contact with those legendary figures.</span></p><p><span>Ian suddenly felt an intense gaze and turned his head.&#xA0;</span><span>One of the statues that was holding a huge greatsword was staring at Ian. Even though it was a stone statue, Ian&#x2019;s heart pounded as it seemed as if the eyes were actually looking at him.&#xA0;</span><span>But that wasn&#x2019;t the only thing that surprised Ian.</span></p><p><span>He was a human.</span></p><p><span>&quot;That human...?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Lenox replied,</span></p><p><span>&quot;Leyteno.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Lenox walked towards the statue of Leyteno.</span></p><p><span>&quot;He walked the path of a warrior like us and was the only human to become a brother of the orcs.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;This human?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;A long time ago, when the humans betrayed us and broke the covenant, Leyteno fought with us against their greed and hypocrisy. He was a warrior who knew honor, a true warrior who never compromised when faced with injustice and never abandoned faith. Every time he wielded his greatsword, the blood of the enemies would gush out like a river.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Lenox extended this fist. The statue of Leyteno stayed still, but it seemed like he met Lenox&#x2019;s fist.</span></p><p><span>&quot;We respectfully call him the master of the greatsword.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>[You have chosen a great warrior, the master of the greatsword, who became the brother of the orcs in human form, Leyteno!]</span></p><p><span>[Your weapon is a greatsword.]</span></p><p><span>[Skill Greatsword Technique (Common) has been acquired.]</span></p><p><span>[Status Window:]</span></p><p><span>Ian, Orc Apprentice Warrior.</span></p><p><span>Level: 1</span></p><p><span>Achievement Points: 10&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>Assimilation: 53%</span></p><p><span>Abilities:&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>Orc&#x2019;s Strength (Common)</span></p><p><span>Orc&#x2019;s Recovery (Common)</span></p><p><span>Greatsword (Common)</span></p><p><span>His weapon was automatically designated by the system, but Ian didn&#x2019;t panic, as he had wanted to choose Leyteno.&#xA0;</span><span>He was a human, but he chose an orc as his character. He felt a sense of connection to Leyteno, who had become a brother of the orcs in human form.&#xA0;</span><span>In addition, Ian had learned the sword from Baek Hanho.</span></p><p><span>[Due to your basic skills, the proficiency of Greatsword Technique (Common) has increased. As proficiency accumulates, you can upgrade it to the Uncommon rating.]</span></p><p><span>How did his game know that he had previously learned swordsmanship? The system was truly elaborate.</span></p><p><span>&quot;Grom has chosen Gloin, whose axe is said to have split apart a whole mountain.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;The axe is good.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;That&apos;s right. The axe is a basic weapon for all orc warriors. Kulkulkul.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Lenox laughed. He also carried an axe on his back.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Follow me.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>After they left the Hall of Fame, Lenox pulled out their weapons from the arsenal next to the training grounds.</span></p><p><span>[The Old Greatsword (Common) has been acquired.]</span></p><p><span>It was difficult to hold the heavy greatsword.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>Unlike other games, Elder Lord didn&#x2019;t have an inventory. It was a game that eliminated user convenience for extreme realism.&#xA0;</span><span>Even considering the size of the orcs, he would have to carry an oversized greatsword from now on.</span></p><p><span>Grom also wobbled as he held his axe. Grom whispered,</span></p><p><span>&quot;We aren&#x2019;t orcs for nothing. Ow, this is a really brutish weapon.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;That&apos;s right.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Ian swung the greatsword in the air. Still, the strength of an orc could be seen.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;I guess you like it, you little ones.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Lenox said with a laugh,&#xA0;</span><span>&quot;But I wonder if that will be the case after listening to my words.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Huh?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;From now on, you will swing your weapon at the training grounds.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>They stood at the training grounds. In addition to the two users, there were numerous orcs training with their weapons.&#xA0;</span><span>The axe and halberd boasted the highest proportion of wielders, followed by hammers and maces. A greatsword like Ian&#x2019;s was rare.</span></p><p><span>They looked at Grom and Ian like they were a spectacle.</span></p><p><span>&quot;Look at my posture.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Lenox took Grom&#x2019;s axe and demonstrated. It was a clean &#x2018;downward blow&#x2019;. Lenox repeated the technique again.&#xA0;</span><span>Then he showed a &#x2018;two-handed slash&#x2019; with Ian&#x2019;s greatsword.</span></p><p><span>&quot;Repeat this.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;How many times?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Until you are satisfied.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Huh...?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Lenox gave a loud laugh,</span></p><p><span>&quot;If you are satisfied, then come find me.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Lenox said before leaving.&#xA0;</span><span>The other orcs gathered around Grom and Ian and laughed,</span></p><p><span>&quot;Kulkulkul. It is starting again!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Kulkul. Hey, newbies. Let me tell you one thing!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Yes?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Instructor Lenox has never been satisfied once.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Then what...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Your should learn it with your body.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>The orcs laughed again,</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Kulkul. Lenox&#x2019;s new sheep, stay alive!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Kuhahaha!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Ahh...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Grom sighed.&#xA0;</span><span>He took the axe and swung it a few times in the air before stopping.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Ian.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Yes?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Ian was familiarizing himself with holding a sword again.</span></p><p><span>&quot;Are you going to continue today?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Yes.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;I&apos;m a little tired, so I need to logout and I&#x2019;ll search for a few attacks. Ah, being an orc is more exhausting than I thought.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;I understand.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Then have fun, I&apos;ll see you later.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Grom gradually disappeared as he logged out.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>At that moment, the other orcs became nervous. How did the orcs perceive his sudden disappearance?&#xA0;</span><span>The orcs clicked their tongues as they saw Grom disappearing.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;What, someone who received the curse of the stars?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>They asked Ian,</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Are you the same?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Huh?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Have you been cursed by the stars?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Help came while Ian was worrying about the answer.</span></p><p><span>[In the world of Elder Lord, users have received the &#x2018;curse of the stars.&#x2019;]</span></p><p><span>[Sometimes they are summoned by the Abyss and due to the curse of the stars, they are revived after dying.]</span></p><p><span>[Those who received the curse of the stars can be released from the curse by building up achievements and receiving &#x2018;God&#x2019;s forgiveness.&#x2019; If they can&#x2019;t, they will be destined to suffer forever in the Abyss.]</span></p><p><span>[If NPCs know that you have been cursed by the stars, then you may be discriminated again.]</span></p><p><span>[Whatever the method, everything in the world of Elder Lord is your choice.]</span></p><p><span>Ian immediately understood the situation. The curse of the stars was a setting created to explain the users logging out and their revival after dying. He nodded at the maker&#x2019;s foresight.</span></p><p><span>Ian replied honestly,&#xA0;</span><span>&quot;That&apos;s right.&quot;</span></p><p><span>&quot;I see.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>They didn&#x2019;t say anything else.&#xA0;</span><span>In the world of Elder Lord, NPCs felt reluctant towards the users cursed by the stars.</span></p><p><span>Ian paid attention to his greatsword again. He recalled Lenox&#x2019;s movements.&#xA0;</span><span>Even if his weapon was a sword, Lenox was a great warrior. Right now, to Ian, Elder Lord wasn&#x2019;t a game, but a new world.</span></p><p><span>He was a newcomer cursed by the stars who was sweating to become an orc warrior.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Kuaaah!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Hiyahhh! I&apos;m alive!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Bul&#x2019;tarrrr!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>A burning spirit rose up inside Ian as he heard and saw the orcs sharpening their skills.</span></p><p><span>Ian wielded his sword.</span></p><p><br></p><hr><p><br></p><p>I have a <a href="www.wuxiaworld.com">Glossary of Common Korean Terms</a> for any unfamiliar honourifics or other Korean elements that you might be unfamiliar with.</p><p>My editor Superposhposh also created a glossary to keep track of everything. Currently it is up to chapter 5 so be careful of spoilers. <a href="docs.google.com">Glossary Link.&#xA0;</a></p><p>Current schedule: 2 chapters a day.</p><p>I have also updated my <a href="www.patreon.com">Patreon</a> to reflect my new novels.
