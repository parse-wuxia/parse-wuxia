<p><span>Chapter 191 - Kill the Thunderbird (4)</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p><p><span>The young thunderbirds were crying.&#xA0;</span><span>There seemed to be 10 of them.&#xA0;</span><span>Thunderbirds were the size of a house. Therefore, the young chicks already reached the chest of an adult human.&#xA0;</span><span>Crockta was perplexed as the young chicks with beautiful feathers looked up at them with clear eyes.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;There are young thunderbirds.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Cute </span><i><span>dot.</span></i><span>..&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>They were similar in height to Tiyo.&#xA0;</span><span>As Tiyo approached, the thunderbirds looked at him and made a curious sound. Tiyo cried out when he was lifted up by one chick.&#xA0;</span><span>The other thunderbird chick beside it rubbed its beak against Tiyo with a pure appearance of no hostility.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Uh?&#x201D;&#xA0;</span><span>Tiyo suddenly flinched. Blood flowed from the beak and stained Tiyo&#x2019;s clothing.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;It seems like they just ate.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Zankus pointed to one side.&#xA0;</span><span>There were the bodies of monsters such as ogres and trolls, as well as the stolen drake. The bodies were torn in places.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;This is why the hunting cycle was sped up.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>There were 10 chicks. They were currently smaller than an adult, but they would soon grow to the size of the mother thunderbird, requiring a huge amount of food.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Then the thunderbird is fighting the ogres because of her chicks</span><i><span> dot</span></i><span>.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;I guess so.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>The thunderbird took risks in hunting and fighting the ogres head on in order to protect her young.&#xA0;</span><span>The chicks didn&#x2019;t know about their mother&#x2019;s efforts as they approached the strange visitors and poked them with their beaks.&#xA0;</span><span>As Crockta stroked a chick&#x2019;s head, it spread open its wings and rubbed its body against his legs. They were very friendly.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Thunderbirds live for 1,000 years,&#x201D; said Zankus as he gazed at a young thunderbird.&#xA0;</span><span>&quot;In addition, the eggs of a thunderbird needs a very long time to hatch. Thunderbirds keep their eggs in a safe and warm place, waiting a long time until they are hatched.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Suddenly, Zankus began to laugh.&#xA0;</span><span>Crockta, Tiyo, and the young thunderbirds stared at him.</span></p><p><span>&quot;I followed the thunderbird in order to surpass Shakan. But I once again realize what a great hunter he was.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Zankus pointed to the entrance of the thunderbird nest.&#xA0;</span><span>It was a place they hadn&#x2019;t looked at.&#xA0;</span><span>As the sun got lower, sunlight poured into the nest. &#xA0;At the same time, shapes appeared on the rock wall near the entrance.</span></p><p><span>They were letters.&#xA0;</span><span>Someone had carved letters on the rock.&#xA0;</span><span>It had been weathered over the years, but the words could still be recognized. Crockta and Tiyo realized who it was.&#xA0;</span><span>The traces of a man they could never forget.</span></p><p><span>[I am a descendant of the Shakan and an unnamed hunter. I leave this here for the hunters of the next generation.&#xA0;</span><span>A true hunter never hunts the young. Thunderbirds live for 1,000 years and have to wait 100 years for their eggs to hatch.</span></p><p><span>Just the fact that you came here means you have succeeded in hunting the thunderbird. These rare birds shouldn&#x2019;t be extinguished from history. We hunters should turn away.]</span></p><p><span>Shakan hadn&#x2019;t failed in hunting the thunderbird.&#xA0;</span><span>He knew that the thunderbird was guarding the eggs and turned away without any regrets.&#xA0;</span><span>It wasn&#x2019;t just Shakan.&#xA0;</span><span>Other marks were seen under the sentence left by Shakan.</span></p><p><span>[I am Prairie Hunter Abudai. I respect Shakan&#x2019;s will.]</span></p><p><span>[I am the dark elf Hikade. Please let the mother mother bird see the fruits of her labor.]</span></p><p><span>[I am Albulla, the world&#x2019;s strongest hunter! Today I will show mercy.]</span></p><p><span>[I miss my wife and children. Hunter Joffrey, I will finish my hunting and return home.]</span></p><p><span>[Wow There are 12 eggs. Take care of your children well, Thunderbird! Hunter William.]</span></p><p><span>Since then, several hunters had come to this point, leaving their mark before turning away.&#xA0;</span><span>A rare species hardly ever seen on the continent, the thunderbird with beautiful dark blue wings.&#xA0;</span><span>Other hunters reached this point, but they stopped hunting to honor Shakan&#x2019;s will and to protect the mother and her eggs.</span></p><p><span>The words they left on the rock were shining brightly in the sunlight.&#xA0;</span><span>Shakan&#x2019;s words were getting weathered, but the traces of the other hunters were clear.&#xA0;</span><span>Some were great hunters that Zankus knew about.</span></p><p><span>&quot;The way they came here is different, but the point they reached is the same.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>The best hunters who had the ability to break through the great forest and reach the thunderbird&#x2019;s nest.&#xA0;</span><span>They all felt the same thing here.&#xA0;</span><span>Zankus met Crockta and Tiyo&#x2019;s gaze as they knew what they had to do now.</span></p><p><span>&quot;Huhu, I actually liked the thunderbird from the beginning </span><i><span>dot.</span></i><span>&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Your muzzle was aiming at it.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;It is a type of greeting </span><i><span>dot.</span></i><span>&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>They separated from the chicks clinging to them and left the thunderbird&#x2019;s nest.&#xA0;</span><span>The cries of the thunderbird could be heard from below.</span></p><p></p><p style="text-align: center"><span>***</span></p><p></p><p><span>Crockta&#x2019;s group climbed down the rock wall without a hitch.&#xA0;</span><span>The thunderbird was flying into the sky and dropping ogres, while fighting the ogre wizard as well.&#xA0;</span><span>Many feathers had fallen and blood was flowing down.</span></p><p><span>Crockta grabbed God Slayer.</span></p><p><span>&quot;I&apos;m sorry for the ogres.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>He measured the distance. He targeted an enemy.</span></p><p><span>&quot;Bul&#x2019;tarrrr!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Crockta jumped off the rock without hesitation.&#xA0;</span><span>God Slayer descended on the ogre.&#xA0;</span><span>Flesh scattered.&#xA0;</span><span>Ogre Slayer was now God Slayer. Even an ogre was a light opponent for God Slayer.&#xA0;</span><span>If he caught a chicken with the blade, the poor chicken would be shattered.</span></p><p><span>God Slayer struck and the ogre died with a gruesome scream.&#xA0;</span><span>The ogre wizard was confused and recoiled from the enemies that appeared above.&#xA0;</span><span>At that time, a giant spear flew and skewered the ogres near the ogre wizard.</span></p><p><span>The ogres shrieked.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Kuwaaaaaah!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>It was Zankus&#x2019; arrow.&#xA0;</span><span>Once the ogres stopped, the suffering thunderbird rose up in the sky. She&#xA0;</span><span>was bewildered by Crockta&#x2019;s group suddenly helping her.</span></p><p><span>There were dozens of ogres. However, Crockta, Tiyo, and Zankus defeated them without a hitch.&#xA0;</span><span>The golden blade shone and huge arrows bombarded them. The magic bullets flying from Tiyo obstructed any ogres that dared to attack.</span></p><p><span>The thunderbird also descended and started attacking the ogres again. She clawed at an ogre aiming at Crockta&#x2019;s back. Crockta raised his thumbs in thanks, causing the thunderbird to flap her wings.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Kuwaaah!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Uwoooo!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Kuaaack!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>The ogres screamed at each other once the situation suddenly changed.&#xA0;</span><span>Then there was a roar from the ogre wizard.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Kuaaaaaaaah!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>They didn&#x2019;t know what it meant, but it sounded like a retreat order. The ogre showed their backs and started to run away.&#xA0;</span><span>Crockta put away his greatsword.&#xA0;</span><span>The ogres disappeared without looking back.&#xA0;</span><span>It was a quick retreat that made it hard to believe a terrible battle had just taken place. The noise of battle disappeared as calmness once again blanketed the great forest.&#xA0;</span><span>Only the corpses of the ogres were scattered all over the place.</span></p><p><span>The thunderbird slowly landed on the ground.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Kkiiiik...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>The thunderbird looked even more beautiful up close.&#xA0;</span><span>As if she understood them, she stared at Crockta&#x2019;s group with clear eyes.&#xA0;</span><span>Zankus approached the thunderbird. The thunderbird lowered her head. The two looked at each other for a while.</span></p><p><span>Zankus reached out his hand.&#xA0;</span><span>The thunderbird extended its beak. Zankus stroked the beak. There were scars and blood from the battle. The thunderbird&#x2019;s beak gently touched Zankus&#x2019; body.&#xA0;</span><span>Both of them had a rapport after confirming there was no hostility towards each other.</span></p><p><span>The thunderbird lowered her body. Then she made a sound.&#xA0;</span><span>He didn&#x2019;t know what it meant at first, but then realized she was telling him to get on her back.&#xA0;</span><span>Zankus climbed onto the thunderbird first. Crockta and Tiyo followed. Although their posture was unstable, Zankus grabbed the thunderbird&#x2019;s neck, Crockta held Zankus and Tiyo held Crockta.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Kkiiik!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>The thunderbird took off.&#xA0;</span><span>The earth became far away in an instant.&#xA0;</span><span>The thunderbird circled around her nest.&#xA0;</span><span>Everything in the great forest seemed like a toy.&#xA0;</span><span>The fighting creatures, the resting creatures, the small birds, everything was below them.</span></p><p><span>The afternoon sun was falling.&#xA0;</span><span>Crockta enjoyed the air rushing past his body as he gazed at the endless green landscape stretching out before him.</span></p><p><span>He was here.&#xA0;</span><span>He lived in the world of Elder Lord.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Bul&#x2019;tar.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>They enjoyed the scenery for a while. Was the thunderbird always seeing such sights?</span></p><p><span>&quot;Beautiful </span><i><span>dot</span></i><span>.&quot;</span></p><p><span>&quot;I completely agree.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>The thunderbird flapped her wings, as if in agreement.&#xA0;</span><span>The thunderbird descended.&#xA0;</span><span>They landed at the thunderbird&#x2019;s nest.&#xA0;</span><span>The chicks appeared to welcome their mother. They jumped clumsily at their mother. The thunderbird spread her wings and covered all of her chicks.</span></p><p><span>From their positions, Crockta&#x2019;s group could see the blood and scars on the thunderbird&#x2019;s back and wings.&#xA0;</span><span>The chicks didn&#x2019;t know.&#xA0;</span><span>How hard the mother thunderbird&#x2019;s day was today.&#xA0;</span><span>How she found food for them and rescued them.&#xA0;</span><span>The bodies outside were living their lives until yesterday.</span></p><p><span>Crockta turned and looked outside.&#xA0;</span><span>The sun was setting. It was a beautiful twilight.&#xA0;</span><span>Looking at this magnificent sight, Crockta thought that the world was too big.&#xA0;</span><span>Everyone was living desperately in it.&#xA0;</span><span>They had their own unique lives.</span></p><p><span>Tiyo stood next to Crockta.</span></p><p><span>&quot;Today has passed </span><i><span>dot</span></i><span>.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>The glow of the sunlight reached this place. The rock wall at the entrance of the nest shone.&#xA0;</span><span>It made the traces of Shakan and the other hunters who came here more prominent.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;There is an empty spot.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span><span>Zankus said. Then he approached the rock.&#xA0;</span><span>&#x201C;How about it?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Crockta and Tiyo smiled and nodded.</span></p><p><span>Zankus pulled out an arrow.&#xA0;</span><span>Shakan&#x2019;s traces, and those of the hunters after him.&#xA0;</span><span>He placed the arrowhead on it.&#xA0;</span><span>Zankus moved his hand. He started to carve deep and sharp letters.</span></p><p><span>[In honor of the greatest hunter, Shakan.]</span></p><p><span>[Hunter Zankus.]</span></p><p><span>Then his hand stopped moving. Crockta received the arrow next. He took it and wrote,</span></p><p><span>[Warrior Crockta.]</span></p><p><span>Then it was Tiyo&#x2019;s turn.</span></p><p><span>[Manly Tiyo.]</span></p><p><span>The three of them laughed heartily at the sight.</span></p><p><span>At that moment.</span></p><p><i><span>Rustle.</span></i></p><p><span>They reacted to the sudden sound.&#xA0;</span><span>Then a brown hand appeared at the entrance of the nest.&#xA0;</span><span>The hand shook for a moment before another hand appeared. The owner of the hand slowly pulled himself up.&#xA0;</span><span>It was dangerous but he eventually reached the nest.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Pant...pant...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>The bone sparrow on his head cried out awkwardly.</span></p><p><span>&#x2018;Chirpppppppp....&#x2019;</span></p><p><span>It was Anor.&#xA0;</span><span>He had been walking here while they fought the ogres and enjoyed the stunning scenery from the thunderbird&#x2019;s back.&#xA0;</span><span>He could barely move at this point.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Pant...pant...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Anor flopped down. He wasn&#x2019;t in a normal state. His whole body was soaked with sweat. He staggered and fell down.</span></p><p><span>&quot;You managed to climb up</span><i><span> dot</span></i><span>.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Tiyo laughed and added letters next to his name.</span></p><p><span>[Weakling Anor.]</span></p><p><span>Suddenly, a young thunderbird approached Crockta, crying out with a desire to play.&#xA0;</span><span>Crockta cuddled with the young thunderbird. Then he looked again at the traces they left behind.</span></p><p><span>[In honor of the greatest hunter, Shakan.</span></p><p><span>Hunter Zankus. Warrior Crockta. Manly Tiyo. Weakling Anor.]</span></p><p><span>The great forest was filled with many dangerous creatures.&#xA0;</span><span>The thunderbird&#x2019;s nest that was located in the harshest place.&#xA0;</span><span>There was a special guestbook shared by the hunters who reached this place.&#xA0;</span><span>Their names had been added.</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p><p><a href="www.wuxiaworld.com">Glossary of Common Korean Terms.</a></p><p>Praise the Orc:&#xA0;<a href="docs.google.com">Glossary Link.&#xA0;</a></p><p>Current schedule:&#xA0;There will now be 14 chapters a week, meaning two chapters every day.</p><p>I have also updated my&#xA0;<a href="www.patreon.com">Patreon</a>&#xA0;to reflect my new novels.
