<p><span>Chapter 14 - About Life (1)</span></p><p><br></p><hr><p><br></p><p><span>Ian spent several days at Thompson&#x2019;s home.&#xA0;</span><span>Derek&#x2019;s men kept threatening them, so Hoyt and Ian took turns protecting the house.</span></p><p><span>Meanwhile, Ian was trained by Hoyt.</span></p><p><span>In Elder Lord, skills were divided into various ratings. Common grade meant one was around the ordinary level, while Uncommon was better even better than that.&#xA0;</span><span>After Uncommon was Special, and then after that was the Rare rank. Following Rare, the current highest known rank, was Essence. &#xA0;It meant literally realizing the essence of the skill.</span></p><p><span>Among the famous rankers of Elder Lord, Choi Hansung&#x2019;s skill, &#x2018;Battlefield Penetrating Eyes&#x2019;, was revealed to be at the Essence grade.</span></p><p><span>Most of the user&#x2019;s skills were Common, Uncommon, or the occasional Special grade skills.&#xA0;</span><span>Elder Lord resembled reality. Everyone&#x2019;s abilities were different, and it wasn&#x2019;t easy for a user to reach a level beyond Special. Therefore, most of them were enthusiastic about gathering as many skills as possible.</span></p><p><span>&quot;Do you believe in your abilities?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;I believe in them to a certain extent.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Ian replied.</span></p><p><span>He learned martial arts. In other words, he was unusually strong. Of course, he trained hard, but it wasn&#x2019;t like his colleagues didn&#x2019;t work hard either. Ian knew that he had a talent for violence.&#xA0;</span><span>Talented people would feel like they were talented.</span></p><p><span>Hoyt nodded.</span></p><p><span>&quot;Certainly, you have talent. However, keep in mind that talent isn&#x2019;t the only thing needed to become strong.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Are you talking about effort?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;I think that the word effort is too light.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>He laughed.</span></p><p><span>&quot;Obsession.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;......&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;We can be anything.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>He didn&#x2019;t want to, but he acknowledged it.&#xA0;</span><span>It wasn&#x2019;t strange to call it a type of power.</span></p><p><span>Ian had lived in poverty, and his parents&#x2019; business hadn&#x2019;t been good in his childhood. After his parents died, he inherited their debt and headed to the battlefield to make money. It was a harsh life that he could never boast about to anyone else.</span></p><p><span>He killed and killed again.&#xA0;</span><span>It was all for the sake of money.&#xA0;</span><span>The targets weren&#x2019;t always evil.</span></p><p><span>Therefore, if he acknowledged Hoyt, he would have to blame himself for choosing life on the battlefield without trying any other ways. Indeed, such guilt tormented his heart.</span></p><p><span>Ian continued, &quot;Not everyone can do that.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Everyone...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Hoyt smiled and aimed his hammer at Ian.</span></p><p><span>&quot;I am not talking to everyone right now.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Then...&quot;</span></p><p><span>&quot;I am talking to you right now.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Ian looked at him. Hoyt&#x2019;s body, full of battle scars and tattoos, was proof of his experience over the past years.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Are you a common person?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;I...&quot;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Do you want to be a warrior?&quot;</span></p><p><span>&quot;I want to be one.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Everyone... If you are like everyone else, then you can&#x2019;t be a warrior. A warrior has to go on a path that no one else has traveled before.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Hoyt moved back and raised the hammer with both of his hands.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Look closely.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Hoyt took a deep breath.&#xA0;</span><span>Ian flinched. The atmosphere seemed to be shaking, and he could feel something coming from Hoyt&#x2019;s body.</span></p><p><span>Strength, it wasn&#x2019;t the same as energy.&#xA0;</span><span>Rather, it was the opposite. As a result, Hoyt&#x2019;s presence became blurred.&#xA0;</span><span>He was becoming a part of this world.&#xA0;</span><span>Then again, he became separate from the world.</span></p><p><span>Hoyt moved his hammer.&#xA0;</span><span>It was a slow motion. However, Ian witnessed the world moving in reverse.&#xA0;</span><span>The world broke with the simple movements of the hammer.</span></p><p><span>Ian wanted to sit down, as he couldn&#x2019;t believe his eyes.&#xA0;</span><span>This, this was the pinnacle state that Baek Hanho said Ian was unlikely to reach in his lifetime.&#xA0;</span><span>This was the domain of the ancient military arts.</span></p><p><span>It was short, but seemed to last for an eternity. Hoyt raised his hammer and restored his breathing. He looked at Ian and smiled.</span></p><p><span>&quot;Did you see?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Ah...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;I was hoping so, but you really are amazing to see it.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;This...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Hoyt put down his hammer. Sweat rolled down his face.</span></p><p><span>&quot;When I was your age, there was a really talented orc. I was stupid compared to him. Something that he took one try to learn would take me 20 or 30 attempts.&quot;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Hoyt....?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;That&#x2019;s right. He really was a genius. He would make an instant judgement and rush at the opponent with marvelous skill. He had a brilliant wit that I could never reach in my lifetime. So, I desperately asked the instructor. What could I do to become stronger?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Hoyt raised the hand at his waist. Ian handed him a towel.</span></p><p><span>&quot;The instructor showed me a number of ways to wield the weapon. And that was enough. I didn&#x2019;t need to know anything else, he said.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>It was the early stages of the pinnacle.</span></p><p><span>&quot;I believed him and repeated his actions like crazy. People laughed at me like it was ridiculous, but I didn&#x2019;t give up. I worked constantly without compromise. 10,000 times, 100,000 times, and more. Then at some point, I became a warrior.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Ian looked at his sword.&#xA0;</span><span>He could do the same.</span></p><p><span>&quot;You definitely have talent,&quot; Hoyt said.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Yes.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;That is why I am saying this.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Yes...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Go towards the pinnacle, and beyond me.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Ian&apos;s martial arts were stagnant.&#xA0;</span><span>It had undergone further development on the battlefield, but was blocked again by a wall. He couldn&#x2019;t go beyond that. Ian inwardly acknowledged his limits.&#xA0;</span><span>But today, he saw beyond it.&#xA0;</span><span>It was inside a game.</span></p><p><span>[Congratulations! You have witnessed a Pinnacle grade skill.]</span></p><p><span>[You feel thrilled by the high level of martial arts and the reality of the Pinnacle grade skill!]</span></p><p><span>[A Pinnacle grade skill is only achieved by the real powerhouses in the world of Elder Lord.]</span></p><p><span>[The title &#x2018;Person Pursuing the Pinnacle&#x2019; has been acquired. All skills will gain proficiency until they reach the Pinnacle grade.]</span></p><p><span>[You have acquired the Mind&#x2019;s Eye (Special) skill that allows you to understand the reality of the target.]</span></p><p><span><span>[One <span id="footnote-50">achievement point has been acquired.]</span></span></span></p><p><span>[Your level has risen.]</span></p><p><span>[Status Window]</span></p><p><span>&apos;Person Pursuing the Pinnacle&#x2019; Ian, Orc Apprentice Warrior</span></p><p><span>Level: 7</span></p><p><span>Achievement Points: 380</span></p><p><span>Assimilation: 57%</span></p><p><span>Abilities:&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>Orc&apos;s Superhuman Strength (Uncommon)</span></p><p><span>Orc&apos;s Vitality (Uncommon)</span></p><p><span>Orc&#x2019;s Greatsword Technique (Uncommon)</span></p><p><span>Warrior&apos;s Fighting Spirit (Uncommon)</span></p><p><span>Mind&apos;s Eye (Special)</span></p><p><span>The messages popped up, but Ian shook his head. Those things didn&#x2019;t matter right now.</span></p><p><span>His heart pounded.&#xA0;</span><span>He wanted to swing his sword. He wanted to move his body. Not just in the game, but in reality as well.&#xA0;</span><span>Ian still couldn&#x2019;t believe that he saw it.</span></p><p><span>&quot;It&#x2019;s hard since it&#x2019;s the first time I&#x2019;ve done it in quite a while.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;It is really wonderful.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;You are even more amazing. You don&#x2019;t seem like an apprentice, since even some of the best warriors would only see a common swing.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Hoyt looked at the sun.&#xA0;</span><span>He had the ability to calculate the approximate time according to the location of the sun, a skill that Ian didn&#x2019;t have.</span></p><p><span>&quot;It&#x2019;s time for Ray to finish.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Ian said, &quot;I&#x2019;ll go.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Please.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Ian started moving.</span></p><p><span>Ray, the oldest of Thompson&#x2019;s children, was attending school. It wasn&#x2019;t a regular training curriculum provided by the government like in Ian&#x2019;s reality, but a private institute run by various intellectual scholars. Thompson believed that his children should be in school, regardless of his economic situation.&#xA0;</span><span>It was an educational facility that the guards of Anail protected, so Derek couldn&#x2019;t reach it with his hands.</span></p><p><span>Ian headed towards the school.&#xA0;</span><span>It had been a few days, so the people of Anail were used to seeing orcs. Some people of different species greeted Ian.</span></p><p><span>&quot;Uh, aren&#x2019;t you selling vegetables now?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;It was a part-time job.&quot;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Too bad.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Stella is still selling fresh vegetables.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;I can&#x2019;t trust that girl.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Kulkulkul.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>The reputation system!&#xA0;</span><span>Reputation existed in Elder Lord. Ian became known in Anail through positive activities, such as selling vegetables and protecting the Thompson family from the vicious loan shark.&#xA0;</span><span>The attitudes of the NPCs changed from what they were before. They didn&#x2019;t discriminate against orcs any longer..</span></p><p><span>Ian entered Ray&#x2019;s school with light footsteps.&#xA0;</span><span>However, the atmosphere was weird.&#xA0;</span><span>The children were forming a circle around something. This was the scene of a typical kid&#x2019;s fight.&#xA0;</span><span>There was a familiar face inside.</span></p><p><span>Ray.</span></p><p><span>Ian watched closely without interrupting. Ray and another child were tangled together as they rolled across the ground. Fists were aimed at the other person.&#xA0;</span><span>Ian touched the shoulder of a child watching on the outside.</span></p><p><span>&quot;Who...heok?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>The child&#x2019;s face turned pale as he was faced with the rugged face of an orc.&#xA0;</span><span>Ian asked quietly, &#x201C;Why are they fighting?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;That...Robin teased Ray and said that his dad had run away.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Hmm...&quot;</span></p><p><span>Ray was pretty tough. Even though it was an even fight, Ray soon overpowered Robin. He got on top of Robin and swung his fist.&#xA0;</span><span>Robin covered his face with his arms. Ray&#x2019;s fist hit the guard.</span></p><p><span>At this moment, Ian interrupted.</span></p><p><span>&quot;Stop, stop.&quot;</span></p><p><span>The children separated like the how the Sea split for Moses after hearing the orc&#x2019;s words.&#xA0;</span><span>Ray also stopped moving.</span></p><p><span>&quot;You shouldn&#x2019;t fight.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Ian pulled them apart. Ray released Robin and started panting, while Robin stepped back with a nosebleed.</span></p><p><span>&quot;If you say it one more time, then I&#x2019;ll kill you,&#x201D; Ray declared, his eyes filled with hate.&#xA0;</span><span>That Robin bastard hadn&#x2019;t died.</span></p><p><span>&quot;That&apos;s right, your dad isn&#x2019;t here right now.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;This bastard!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Ian stopped Ray, who shook his head as he was grabbed by Ian.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Mister! That asshole, look at what he is saying! I&#x2019;ll kill him!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Ian was stumped.&#xA0;</span><span>When he was a child, he beat someone up for cursing at his family. Ian couldn&#x2019;t say to not use violence because he understood Ray.&#xA0;</span><span>In addition, this was Elder Lord, where fists were close to being the law, unlike in the real world. It wasn&#x2019;t an ideal story. In the end, humans had to learn how to survive on their own in this world.</span></p><p><span>Ian just shook his head.</span></p><p><span>&quot;It is done, so let&#x2019;s stop here. You don&#x2019;t want to fight anymore, do you?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Ray was still enthusiastic, but Robin didn&#x2019;t want to fight any longer. He wiped his bloody nose with his sleeve.&#xA0;</span><span>Ian dispersed the children.</span></p><p><span>He took Ray and started heading back home. Ian had raised Yiyu, but she didn&#x2019;t experience this situation because she was a girl. She would just quarrel with her friends and then they would make up.</span></p><p><span>&quot;Mister, I want to become stronger by learning the sword like you.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Why?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;If I get stronger, then I can kill those guys.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Ian chuckled in a low voice.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Do you want to kill them?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Yes.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Isn&#x2019;t that too much?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;I am angry.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;You can&#x2019;t kill a person just because you don&#x2019;t like them, Ray.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;......&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;There is always someone stronger than you. Then what if that person appears and kills a person you care about?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Then I will die fighting them, like a man.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Ian looked at Ray. Ray avoided his gaze as if he knew what Ian was thinking.</span></p><p><span>&quot;That isn&#x2019;t a manly thing to do.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;......&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Ray. It is easy to speak about death.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Ian patted the head of the silent Ray.&#xA0;</span><span>He seemed more suited to the world of Elder Lord.&#xA0;</span><span>He received a secret killing technique from Baek Hanho and survived on the battlefield. These things had no place in the real world.&#xA0;</span><span>He might run a cafe that made coffee, but he knew more about fighting and killing, life and death, than anyone else.</span></p><p><span>Ian scratched his head. His mind was complicated.&#xA0;</span><span>At that time, some people appeared and surrounded Ian and Ray.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Hello Orc, we meet again.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>This face. It was one of Derek&#x2019;s underlings who broke into Thompson&#x2019;s house.</span></p><p><span>&quot;That monster isn&#x2019;t here this time, so won&#x2019;t it be different?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>All of them were holding weapons. Their purpose was obvious, even to a blind man.</span></p><p><span>Ian placed Ray behind him and grabbed his sword handle. He measured their power. If they were his opponents, then he would be able to get away with Ray somehow.</span></p><p><span>But there was a man watching from the rear.&#xA0;</span><span>A middle-aged man with a beard looked at Ian with a bored face. He wore expensive clothing and held a sword.&#xA0;</span><span>An bright aura shone around the sharp blade.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Are you a friend of Hoyt...?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>A low and hoarse voice emerged from the man. He stepped forward.&#xA0;</span><span>A strong force was emitted from his whole body. Ian was nervous.</span></p><p><span>Strong.&#xA0;</span><span>Clearly stronger than Ian.</span></p><p><span>&quot;I am Derek, Young Man.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Ian gathered his strength as he listened. He had to hang in there. Looking at Derek&#x2019;s nonchalant face, Ian felt like an egg before an approaching knife. His entire body was ready. Derek approached.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;The interest...I will have you pay for it with your body.&#x201D;</span></p><hr><p><br></p><p><a href="www.wuxiaworld.com">Glossary of Common Korean Terms.</a></p><p>Praise the Orc: <a href="docs.google.com">Glossary Link.&#xA0;</a></p><p>Current schedule: &#xA0;Next Patreon goal reached!!
