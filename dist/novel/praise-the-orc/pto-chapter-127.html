<p><span>Chapter 127 - White Knight (2)</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p><p><span>Baek Hanho stopped punching the sandbag and pointed out the attitude of the members as he circled the gym.&#xA0;</span><span>Due to his sensitive temper today, if he corrected a posture and they didn&#x2019;t do it well, he would demonstrate it himself.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;......&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>A female member watched with fear as Baek Hanho approached her.</span></p><p><span>&#x2018;Baek Hanho&#x2019;s gym was a gathering place for men who had strength in the neighborhood and wanted to do some fighting. All of them were rugged and rough looking men.&#xA0;</span><span>Such men had fallen at Baek Hanho&#x2019;s gentle hand.</span></p><p><span>She was just an ordinary person who had a house nearby and wanted to become healthy.&#xA0;</span><span>She laughed awkwardly when Baek Hanho stood in front of her.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Hahaha... Manager-nim.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Have you practiced what I taught you before? Let me see it once. One two!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Uh...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>She closed her eyes.&#xA0;</span><span>Then she extended her fist awkwardly.</span></p><p><i><span>Hwiik.</span></i> <i><span>Hwiik.</span></i></p><p><span>&quot;One two, one two!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Aih!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Double this time!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Uhh.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Two one two one!&#x201D;</span></p><p><i><span>Hwik hwik.</span></i> <i><span>Hwik!</span></i> <i><span>Hwik hwik hwik.</span></i></p><p><span>She flailed around.&#xA0;</span><span>The previous men had fallen down right away.&#xA0;</span><span>But for some reason, Baek Hanho was nodding.</span></p><p><span>&quot;Good.&quot;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;......?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;You have been here for three months?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Four months...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Hahaha. That is very good. Exercising is good.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;......&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>She couldn&#x2019;t help nodding dumbly because she had just witnessed a one-month member collapse from a low kick 1cm under the waist.</span></p><p><span>&quot;But keep this in mind. Our physical body is a weapon. Martial arts is murder.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Huh?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;If possible, especially if you are a woman, try to resolve the situation without fighting.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span><span>Baek Hanho gazed at a distant place and said.&#xA0;</span><span>&quot;It is a knight&#x2019;s mission to protect ladies but this world...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>She forced a smile as Baek Hanho started talking nonsense.</span></p><p><span>&quot;Knights have disappeared in modern times...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Someone should tell him.&#xA0;</span><span>But he was already in his own world. There was no one in this gym who could stop him.</span></p><p><span>At that moment.&#xA0;</span><span>&quot;What are you doing?&quot;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;......&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>It was Ian.&#xA0;</span><span>Ian stood behind Baek Hanho. He looked at Baek Hanho with questioning eyes.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Hum hum, you came.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Why are you speaking strange words all of a sudden?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;What type of strange things was I saying?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Play games a bit more moderately.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Who are you to say...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Ian and Baek Hanho started to walk towards the manager&#x2019;s office while talking.</span></p><p><span>The female member stared blankly after them.&#xA0;</span><span>After being left alone, the female member punched the sandbag and thought about Baek Hanho&#x2019;s words.&#xA0;</span><span>Their bodies were a weapon. Martial arts was murder.&#xA0;</span><span>And &#x2018;ladies.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span>She laughed.</span></p><p><span>&quot;How old-fashioned.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Then she quietly stared into the air. Her hands were making strange gestures.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Magic is to save people.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>In Elder Lord, she was a magician.</span></p><p></p><p style="text-align: center"><span>***</span></p><p></p><p><span>&quot;What have you been doing? Yeori is worried about you.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Ian&#x2019;s eyes narrowed.&#xA0;</span><span>&quot;Yeori?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Yes, Yeori.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;When did you talk to Yeori?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;A little while ago.&quot;&#xA0;</span><span>As Ian stared at him, Baek Hanho shrugged and shook his head.&#xA0;</span><span>&quot;Oh, she showed interest because I am the one who taught you, but that is it. So don&#x2019;t glare at me like that.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;It is hard to believe when looking at you. Aren&#x2019;t you playing as a knight too much in the game?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;This kid, insulting your teacher. In the old days, this would be punished.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Ian laughed.&#xA0;</span><span>&quot;What...if you are capable...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Ian and Baek Hanho&#x2019;s eyes clashed again. Sparks were flying from both pairs of eyes.&#xA0;</span><span>It felt like they would head back to the ring again, but the two of them shook their heads and leaned back.</span></p><p><span>&quot;I guess I&#x2019;m too tired...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;I did say...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Ian wanted to take a break for a while after fighting Calmahart. While the capsule allowed him to control his character without moving a muscle, he was still mentally exhausted.&#xA0;</span><span>Baek Hanho was also tired from his activities in Elder Lord so he didn&#x2019;t want to bother with Ian.</span></p><p><span>They just leaned back in their chairs. Baek Hanho sighed and asked.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;What species are you?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;It&#x2019;s a secret.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Class?&quot;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Secret.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;This guy.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;What about Teacher? Are you a knight?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Will you tell me if I tell you?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;No.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Phew, I brought up my disciple wrongly.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;It is because of Teacher that your disciple grew up like this.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Well...your words aren&#x2019;t wrong.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span><span>Baek Hanho laughed as he leaned back in his chair.&#xA0;</span><span>&#x201C;Ian.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Yes.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;These days, this guy has been running wild.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Baek Hanho raised a hand and a video appeared on the television screen that occupied a wall of the manager&#x2019;s office.&#xA0;</span><span>Ian flinched.&#xA0;</span><span>It was Crockta.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;......&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>To other people, Crockta looked really hideous.&#xA0;</span><span>A heinous face, a fearsome body that was covered in tattoos, a hand that held the ignorantly large greatsword, regardless of fatigue.&#xA0;</span><span>Just looking at his appearance, he seemed like a villain.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;I don&#x2019;t like him.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;W-Why?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;I was trying to catch the enemy called Calmahart, but this guy finished it before I could even start.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Baek Hanho changed the screen.&#xA0;</span><span>This time, it was the best video site in the world, Youvids. The main screen of Youvids was filled with Crockta.&#xA0;</span><span>After the news of Calmahart&#x2019;s defeat had spread, the value of Righteous Orc Crockta rose again, meaning videos of Laney and other users who filmed him were constantly rising.</span></p><p><span>The number of views had already reached the peak.&#xA0;</span><span>Video&#x2019;s of Choi Hansung&#x2019;s war had been pushed to the next level by Crockta.</span></p><p><span>&quot;I will catch this guy!&#x201D;&#xA0;</span><span>Baek Hanho cried out.</span></p><p><span>Ian stilled.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;What, are you scared?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;...No.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Baek Hanho nodded. &#xA0;</span><span>&#x201C;I know. He is a frightening guy. No matter how strong he is, he is still a monster in the game! He has ridiculous strength and physical abilities.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Crockta&#x2019;s battle footage.</span></p><p><span>Chesswood.&#xA0;</span><span>Ian&#x2019;s mind sank into the memories of that time. Innocent people had died. They weren&#x2019;t NPCs. Those who actually existed were killed by users connected to Elder Lord.&#xA0;</span><span>Due to the &#x2018;cognitive modification&#x2019; power of the god, others couldn&#x2019;t even understand this possibility.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Look. That beast-like movement.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span><span>It was a scene where Crockta pierced through spears and swords, killing them all. He jumped into the middle of enemy territory.&#xA0;</span><span>The users started to run away. Crockta chased and stabbed his sword in their backs.</span></p><p><span>&quot;The amazing thing is the speed of development.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>This time, it was a video of the past.&#xA0;</span><span>Three players were confronting an orc. It was the user hunters he bumped into at Anail.&#xA0;</span><span>They wanted to kill Crockta but he took the lives of the enemies in a flash.</span></p><p><span>&quot;The boldness and determination are amazing. This person knows how to fight properly.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>It was a compliment from Baek Hanho but Ian felt strangely anxious.</span></p><p><span>Ian asked.&#xA0;</span><span>&quot;So?&quot;</span></p><p><span>&quot;I have to catch this guy.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;...Why?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;I don&#x2019;t like him.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Ian looked at Baek Hanho&#x2019;s expression.&#xA0;</span><span>He was sincere.&#xA0;</span><span>That expression, he was going to swing his sword as soon as Crockta returned to the continent.</span></p><p><span>Ian calmly said.&#xA0;</span><span>&quot;Hold on. Crockta is strong, righteous and popular. He even has a fan club.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Fan club? I am one too.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Huh?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Huhuhu, do you want to know?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Don&#x2019;t lie.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;This guy...really. Of course, I won&#x2019;t tell you. You can just wonder.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;......&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Baek Hanho changed the screen again. As he did so, he unwittingly opened the menu of his favorite Youvids videos.</span></p><p><span>&quot;......!&quot;</span></p><p><span>Baek Hanho hurriedly turned it off and looked to see if Ian had seen his favorites menu.&#xA0;</span><span>Fortunately, Ian was checking his phone.</span></p><p><span>&quot;What are you looking at?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Nothing.&quot;</span></p><p><span>Baek Hanho coughed.</span></p><p><span>&quot;I have to go now. I need to show my face at the cafe.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Yes. Don&#x2019;t just let other people do the work. Unearned income makes people sick.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>In fact, the gym was mostly run under Baek Hanho&#x2019;s supervision.&#xA0;</span><span>Ian shook his head.</span></p><p><span>&quot;Take care.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;You too.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Ian left Baek Hanho&#x2019;s gym.&#xA0;</span><span>Then he headed towards Cafe Reason.</span></p><p></p><p style="text-align: center"><span>***</span></p><p></p><p><span>He didn&#x2019;t come empty-handed. He stopped by the bakery and bought a few things.</span></p><p><span>After arriving at Cafe Reason, Han Yeori grumbled and gave some to Yoo Sooyeon, who was arranging a few minor things on the counter.&#xA0;</span><span>There were customers.</span></p><p><span>Ian opened his phone while sipping a latte that he made.&#xA0;</span><span>He entered a search term.</span></p><p><span>&#x2018;White Knight Andre.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span>Ian had briefly seen Baek Hanho&#x2019;s favorites list.&#xA0;</span><span>Baek Hanho&#x2019;s favorites were filled with videos of a user called White Knight Andre. Immediately after confirming it, he pretended to be doing something else.</span></p><p><span>If he knew his enemy, he could win.&#xA0;</span><span>Baek Hanho would surely come to him.&#xA0;</span><span>It would be in the world of Elder Lord.</span></p><p><span>The first kill!&#xA0;</span><span>He would do it.</span></p><p><span>The name &#x2018;White Knight Andre&#x2019; was well-known.</span></p><p><span>&quot;Uh, Boss-nim knows about Andre?&#x201D;&#xA0;</span><span>Han Yeori approached and sat down next to him.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;You know him?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;I know. He is really cool.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;...Cool?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Yes.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Ian looked at the video playing with questionable eyes and Han Yeori said.&#xA0;</span><span>&quot;I don&#x2019;t play the game but I&#x2019;ve seen videos of this person.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Then Ian almost spat out his coffee at the close-up appearance of the character.</span></p><p><span>Dazzling blonde hair.&#xA0;</span><span>Clear blue eyes. A straight nose, white skin with no wrinkles and soft pink lips. Silver plated armor covered the entire body.&#xA0;</span><span>It was the appearance of a medieval young knight.&#xA0;</span><span>How much work could be done to customize his appearance to such an extent?</span></p><p><span>Furthermore, he was riding on a beautiful white horse with a flowing mane.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Isn&#x2019;t he cool?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Um...&#x201D;&#xA0;</span><span>Ian nodded.</span></p><p><span>In the video, Baek Hanho, no White Knight Andre was speaking.</span></p><p><span>&quot;Diabolical ones who wield a sword against a lady.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>He got down from his horse.&#xA0;</span><span>He rubbed the forehead of the white horse, as if telling it to wait a moment, before raising his sword towards the enemies in front of him. I</span><span>t was a well-worn longsword.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;I am Knight Andre, and I will let you know what justice is.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Then he rushed towards the enemies in front of him.&#xA0;</span><span>The opponents were bandits equipped with axes and swords. They swung their weapons. They were confused at first by Andre&#x2019;s splendor but gained confidence due to their belief in their numerical superiority.</span></p><p><span>However, that only lasted for a short moment.&#xA0;</span><span>Andre&#x2019;s sleek swordsmanship stopped their breaths.&#xA0;</span><span>There was no gory battle with blood and flesh.&#xA0;</span><span>One pierce that gracefully penetrated the enemy&#x2019;s weak points.&#xA0;</span><span>Fluid techniques.</span></p><p><span>All the enemies were destroyed. White Knight Andre turned softly.&#xA0;</span><span>The female NPC, who had been threatened by the bandits, stared at him blankly. Andre approached and grabbed her hand.&#xA0;</span><span>Then he kissed the back of her hand and winked softly.</span></p><p><span>&quot;Lady. I took care of the opponents. Please rest assured.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>A sweet smile!&#xA0;</span><span>Then the video faded out.</span></p><p><span>Han Yeori poked Ian&#x2019;s side.&#xA0;</span><span>&#x201C;So cool. He is a real Prince Charming. Isn&apos;t that right? Boss-nim?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>However, Ian knew the reality so he couldn&#x2019;t nod.&#xA0;</span><span>Han Yeori giggled and went back to the counter.&#xA0;</span><span>Ian wanted to erase his memories, no he wanted to clean his eyes and forget he ever saw this video.</span></p><p><span>Ian read the comments.&#xA0;</span><span>At first, there were compliments.</span></p><p><span>&#x2514; Milky Andre: I&apos;m Andre&#x2019;s fan! ^^ Continue the video! Have strength Andre!</span></p><p><span>&#x2514; Fatal White Knight: &#xA0;&gt;&#x3145;&lt;</span><span>I want to see Andre every day... Where is it? The answer to my problems...Andre&#x2019;s pink lips...Chu...</span></p><p><span>&#x2514; White Cacao: The background is Hesse Mountain! I will also kiss...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x2514; Jung Min&#x2019;s Mother: Andre,,,, a wonderful young man,,, ~^^</span><span>I want my daughter to play the game like Andre,,,~~?^^ </span><span>Please continue to do justice ,,~~~~!&#x314E;&#x314E;&#x314E;</span></p><p><span>&#x2514; Yiyu&#x2019;s Mother: I am the same as well,,,~^^ our children are good,,,&#x314E;&#x314E;</span></p><p><span>However, the comments gradually changed.</span></p><p><span>&#x2514; Shochu is Tasty: Damn,,,,this labor,,,,to me,,,I&#x2019;m not going to apologize,,,look at the eyes,,,a handsome man pretending to be good,,,~! Don&#x2019;t tremble,,,reveal your nature,,, kyack,,,spit! Justice?Crockta is the best ~</span></p><p><span>&#x2514; Mt.

Crockta is the definition of justice. I promise that he will be hit by Crockta.</span></p><p><span>&#x2514; Orc King: &#x314B; &#x314B; &#x314B; &#x314B; &#x314B; &#x314B; When he meets Crockta &#xA0;&#x314B;&#x314B;&#x314B;&#x314B; take a video and upload it &#x3142;&#x3145;&#x314B;&#x314B;&#x314B;</span></p><p><span>&#x2514; Bul&#x2019;tar Crockta: &#x314B; &#x314B; &#x314B; Crockta will twist him up &#x314B;&#x314B;&#x314B; A real man vs. a rural village gangster.</span></p><p><span>&#x2514; Xylitol One Shot: Are you talking about the definition of justice again? Where did this come from? Did Andre save a village like Crockta? Did he create a storm before leaving. What did he do except act good in front of women? &#x3149;&#x3149;</span></p><p><span>&#x2514; Barking Dog: Bark bark! Bark bark bark! Grrrr bark!</span></p><p><span>&#x2514; Moderation: How irritating... When I see a video of Crockta, I get a thrill... My hands and feet...</span></p><p><span>&#x2514; Philosopher: This friend is only brilliant when he is catching weak opponents. I miss Crockta.</span></p><p><span>Ian shook his head.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;......&#x201D;&#xA0;</span><span>His shoulders started to shake.&#xA0;</span><span>&#x201C;...Kuk...Cough...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Ian&#x2019;s shoulders moved up and down as he couldn&#x2019;t help laughing.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Puhuhu...puhuhuhuhut...!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Sometimes the standards of the world were so different from his.</span></p><p><span>But.&#xA0;</span><span>This wasn&#x2019;t so different from his viewpoint.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Ah. That&#x2019;s right. Crockta is the definition of justice. It is in the eyes of the beholder.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Gradually, the comments increased and it became &#x2018;Crockta vs. Andre.&#x2019; Andre&#x2019;s fans and his anti-fans engaged in a keyboard battle.&#xA0;</span><span>In particular, Andre had recently said he wanted to fight Crockta so this remarks became more intense.</span></p><p><span>The two characters of justice.&#xA0;</span><span>The women who had a crush on White Knight Andre! The men who supported Orc Warrior Crockta!</span></p><p><span>Han Yeori sighed as she watched Ian laughing.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Why is he coming like that more and more...&#x201D;</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p><p><a href="www.wuxiaworld.com">Glossary of Common Korean Terms.</a></p><p>Praise the Orc:&#xA0;<a href="docs.google.com">Glossary Link.&#xA0;</a></p><p>Current schedule:&#xA0;There will now be 14 chapters a week, meaning two chapters every day.</p><p>I have also updated my&#xA0;<a href="www.patreon.com">Patreon</a>&#xA0;to reflect my new novels.
