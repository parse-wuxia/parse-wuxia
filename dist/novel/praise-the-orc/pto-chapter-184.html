<p><span>Chapter 184 - The Last Fire (2)</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p><p><span>&#x201C;I didn&#x2019;t know that &#x2018;Slayer Maker&#x2019; would come here.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span><span>Rastad, the old dwarf guarding the last forge, laughed while stroking his long beard.&#xA0;</span><span>&#x201C;Is Solardo of the Golden Anvil Clan doing well?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;He is hitting the iron like before.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Solardo allowed you to come here?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;......&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Zakiro smiled,&#xA0;</span><span>&#x201C;That&apos;s right. I came on my own.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;I see.&#xA0;</span><span>Any young blacksmith will come here at least once. And the Slayer Maker is qualified enough.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;You&apos;re overpraising me.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;I&#x2019;ve seen the Wizard Slayer that you created.&#x201D;</span></p><p><i><span>Kang!</span></i> <i><span>Kang!</span></i></p><p><span>Rastad looked at the place where the sound came from.&#xA0;</span><span>In one corner, a dwarf was hammering on iron. The heated piece of iron was struck by the hammer and slowly changed shaped. Then the hammering sped up.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;It is a quick and fast sword.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;A big weapon isn&#x2019;t needed to kill a magician.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;That&apos;s right. It was excellent. Who is using the sword now?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;I don&#x2019;t know.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;You truly resemble Solardo.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span><span>Rastad smiled bitterly.&#xA0;</span><span>&#x201C;Wizard Slayer is now in the hands of a lunatic who hates magicians. Numerous innocent magicians have died at his hand.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Is that so?&#x201D;&#xA0;</span><span>Zakiro shrugged.&#xA0;</span><span>&#x201C;It has nothing to do with me.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;You truly are Solardo&#x2019;s clan member.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span><span>Rastad laughed out loud.&#xA0;</span><span>&#x201C;Yes, Slayer Maker. What monster will you make at the last forge here? This time, will it be an ogre slayer?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;I already created that.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Huh, I see. It is a weapon against ogres, but the owner will surely suffer.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Zakiro shrugged at Rastad&#x2019;s words.&#xA0;</span><span>He&#x2019;d met the orc warrior who used Ogre Slayer and seen him kill an ogre easily. The greatsword was too big, but when it entered the orc&#x2019;s hands, it felt like it had been made for him.</span></p><p><span>Zakiro smiled,&#xA0;</span><span>&#x201C;Since you&#x2019;ve completed Ogre Slayer, is it now a dragon slayer?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Dragon Slayer...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Dragons were an invisible and forgotten species. At one time, they flew over mountains and valleys regularly, but now people never saw them.&#xA0;</span><span>Some said that they were all dead, while others said they were hidden somewhere. &#xA0;However, one thing was certain, which was that the dragons wouldn&#x2019;t regain their former glory.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;My sword would lose if I make such a thing.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Indeed, it is impossible to use a sword to fight against a dragon. Then what about a second version of Ogre Slayer? There is trouble with ogres in this area.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;I&#x2019;m not sure.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span><span>Zakiro&#x2019;s face darkened.&#xA0;</span><span>&#x201C;I will think about it.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>He had left the Golden Anvil Clan because of this.</span></p><p><span>Zakiro surpassed the level of young craftsmen. At a young age, he had already become a top blacksmith, and his Slayer series were masterpieces which everyone wanted. Many warriors and knights had asked him to make weapons for them.</span></p><p><span>However, now, he didn&#x2019;t have a blueprint for the next piece.&#xA0;</span><span>He didn&#x2019;t have an image which made him want to work the metal enthusiastically.&#xA0;</span><span>In the old days, the true face hidden in the iron had been visible.&#xA0;</span><span>But there was nothing now. He had broken several attempts and beat the iron only to melt it again. So, his slump had become prolonged.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;You are young.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span><span>Rastad tapped his shoulder.&#xA0;</span><span>&#x201C;Don&#x2019;t be in a rush. Stay and think slowly. You can stay in the blacksmith&#x2019;s quarters.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Thank you.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;This is the last forge, a place where you can beat iron as long as the sun shines. Hahaha. I guess I should look at that person.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Rastad approached the blacksmith who was hammering the iron.&#xA0;</span><span>The blacksmith was a dwarf younger than Zakiro. He didn&#x2019;t have the skills, but he had a passion for hammering iron.&#xA0;</span><span>Zakiro watched them for a while before leaving the last forge.</span></p><p><span>The dwarf who was the sun god&#x2019;s priest saw him and bowed. Zakiro greeted him politely as well.</span></p><p></p><p style="text-align: center"><span>***</span></p><p></p><p><span>By the time he left the temple of the sun god, it was dark.&#xA0;</span><span>Geherad was quiet. There were occasional raucous sounds from the pubs, but most of the buildings had turned off their lights.&#xA0;</span><span>It was a land of the temple of the sun god. They slept early and looked forward to the sunrise, rather than staying up at night.</span></p><p><span>At that moment...</span></p><p><i><span>Chaeng!</span></i></p><p><span>Zakiro heard a noise.&#xA0;</span><span>He turned around.&#xA0;</span><span>As a blacksmith, it was a sound which was impossible for him not to know.&#xA0;</span><span>It was the sound of weapons hitting each other. A battle was occurring somewhere, and the sound of the metal was strangely familiar.</span></p><p><span>He had heard that sound many times over the past few days.&#xA0;</span><span>It was the sound of Ogre Slayer smashing monsters.&#xA0;</span><span>Crockta was fighting.</span></p><p><span>Zakiro started running.&#xA0;</span><span>The sound was coming from a corner of Geherad, where people rarely went. It was dark, but he ran using the light of the moon and the sound.&#xA0;</span><span>As Zakiro approached, iron flashed in the darkness.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;......!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>A group of people was surrounding Crockta and a man. The two of them were exchanging blows.&#xA0;</span><span>Zakiro moved closer and saw Tiyo and Anor, who spotted him and waved.</span></p><p><span>He stood next to them.&#xA0;</span><span>&#x201C;What is this...?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Strange guys picked a fight with us <em>dot</em>.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span><span>Tiyo explained,&#xA0;</span><span>&#x201C;They said we would be punished according to a divine message&#x2026; Strange guys <em>dot</em>.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;......!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Zakiro knew about the divine message. All the gods wanted Crockta and the orcs to die.&#xA0;</span><span>These people were probably fanatical followers of the gods. To them, the commands of the gods were absolute.</span></p><p><span>Indeed, the group of hooded men holding weapons was watching Crockta and the man fight, as if it was a sacred ceremony.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Great <em>dot</em>. Being able to fight against Crockta...&#x201D;&#xA0;</span><span>Tiyo muttered.</span></p><p><span>However, Zakiro couldn&#x2019;t tell. His vision had adapted to the darkness to some extent, but their swords were moving too quickly for him to see.&#xA0;</span><span>Every time a light flashed, someone received damage and stepped back.</span></p><p><span>Crockta, the person who conquered the north and obstructed the empire... He had killed the crazy chieftain in the north and defeated the empire&#x2019;s genius, Adandator.&#xA0;</span><span>However, a nameless fanatic was matching him in the fight.</span></p><p><span>The two chose to catch their breath for a moment.&#xA0;</span><span>Crockta stared at the man, and suspicions about the opponent filled his eyes.&#xA0;</span><span>It was an expression which showed the fight wasn&#x2019;t going according to his will.</span></p><p><span>Zakiro followed Crockta&#x2019;s gaze towards the opponent. The hood was torn, so the opponent&#x2019;s face was revealed. It was a middle-aged man. He looked at Crockta with a calm expression.</span></p><p><span>Then he declared,&#xA0;</span><span>&#x201C;You can&#x2019;t resist the power of the gods. Accept your fate, Crockta.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>It was at this moment that Zakiro realized something.&#xA0;</span><span>There was a faint light coming from the man&#x2019;s sword.&#xA0;</span><span>Magic swords were able to exert such power. However, Zakiro saw that it wasn&#x2019;t a magic sword.</span></p><p><span>God&#x2019;s soldier...</span></p><p><span>Crockta&#x2019;s opponent wasn&#x2019;t a warrior who was good at the sword.&#xA0;</span><span>However, he had the power of a god itself.&#xA0;</span><span>A god&#x2019;s power was coming down to the man through that sword. It wasn&#x2019;t the god&#x2019;s full power as there were constraints about using divine power against mortals. However, this was enough to aim at Crockta&#x2019;s neck.</span></p><p><span>The man wielded his sword again.&#xA0;</span><span>A light flashed.</span></p><p><i><span>Kaaang!</span></i></p><p><span>Crockta blocked the sword with Ogre Slayer.&#xA0;</span><span>Then he stepped back.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Ugh.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;In the name of the gods!&#x201D;</span></p><p><i><span>Kakang!</span></i></p><p><span>Zakiro could see it.&#xA0;</span><span>Crockta&apos;s sword, Ogre Slayer, was shaking.&#xA0;</span><span>Zakiro was a blacksmith, a master who heard the voice of the iron and the sword.&#xA0;</span><span>Just like how a warrior saw the paths through the opponent&#x2019;s gap in order to kill them, Zakiro had an eye for seeing through metals and weapons.</span></p><p><span>In his eyes, Ogre Slayer looked like a boxer who barely blocked the punch.</span></p><p><span>It had won many fights but hadn&#x2019;t healed properly, causing the wounds to accumulate. Its broken bones set wrong, and its wounds filled with pus. A punch to the head caused damage which would make the hands shake.</span></p><p><span>However, nevertheless, Ogre Slayer still looked straight at the opponent.&#xA0;</span><span>This was a fight, and the opponent was still in the ring.&#xA0;</span><span>A fighter who wouldn&#x2019;t collapse when weak...&#xA0;</span><span>That was Ogre Slayer.&#xA0;</span><span>And Zakiro was the father who had made Ogre Slayer.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Bul&#x2019;tar&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Crockta&#x2019;s roar shook Geherad...</span></p><p><span>And Crockta&#x2019;s speed increased.</span></p><p><span>The man stepped back from Crockta&#x2019;s power.&#xA0;</span><span>An unknown swordsmanship was being used with Zakiro&#x2019;s sword as Ogre Slayer implemented an unknown power.&#xA0;</span><span>The man&#x2019;s sword bounced off, and Ogre Slayer aimed towards the gap.</span></p><p><span>However, it was blocked.&#xA0;</span><span>This was the god&#x2019;s power.&#xA0;</span><span>Opportunities were equally given to both sides.&#xA0;</span><span>The enemy&#x2019;s attack flew when Crockta&#x2019;s blow was deflected towards the ground. The sword had a white haze around it.</span></p><p><span>Then Crockta raised Ogre Slayer.</span></p><p><i><span>Kaaaang!</span></i></p><p><span>At that moment, Zakiro thought that Ogre Slayer would break.&#xA0;</span><span>However, it managed to hold on.&#xA0;</span><span>Crockta blocked the attack and kicked the man&#x2019;s elbow. The sword was momentarily lowered. Then Crockta turned and swung his greatsword at the man.</span></p><p><span>It seemed like this fight was over.&#xA0;</span><span>However, the man&#x2019;s sword swung around in the air, as if a thread was tied to it. Then it moved into a position to stop Crockta&#x2019;s sword.&#xA0;</span><span>The man grabbed his sword and inserted strength into his legs.</span></p><p><i><span>Kwaaaaang!</span></i></p><p><span>Once again, the two swords collided.&#xA0;</span><span>The man was pushed back.&#xA0;</span><span>It was a power struggle.&#xA0;</span><span>The dim light from the man&#x2019;s sword enlarged to cover his body, and his eyes shone white. The god&#x2019;s power was encroaching on his body.</span></p><p><span>His sword became faster. It aimed at Crockta from every direction. Thanks to the gods, the man&#x2019;s attacks were swift and powerful.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;......!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>However, Crockta&#x2019;s Ogre Slayer defended against all attacks. It endured, and the reaction was marvelous.&#xA0;</span><span>Crockta was really one with the sword.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Is that really my sword...?&#x201D;&#xA0;</span><span>Zakiro muttered.</span></p><p><span>It was beautiful swordsmanship.&#xA0;</span><span>However, it wasn&#x2019;t beautiful due to smooth movements or gentle curves...&#xA0;</span><span>But because the sword and owner were one.&#xA0;</span><span>All types of movements were completed with the big greatsword.&#xA0;</span><span>Zakiro couldn&#x2019;t tell if Crockta was leading the sword, or if the sword was leading him. The sword was connected to Crockta, and they moved as one.</span></p><p><span>Then Crockta hit his opponent&#x2019;s abdomen.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;</span><i><span>Cough!</span></i><span>&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Crockta immediately swung the greatsword at his opponent.</span></p><p><i><span>Kakang!</span></i></p><p><span>The enemy&#x2019;s sword flew through the air. It rolled across the ground and stopped at Zakiro&#x2019;s feet.&#xA0;</span><span>The dim light faded, and it became dark.&#xA0;</span><span>The god left.&#xA0;</span><span>Zakiro picked up the sword. It wasn&#x2019;t a bad sword, but it wasn&#x2019;t superb craftsmanship. It was just a fairly decent sword.</span></p><p><span>He raised his head and looked at Crockta and the man.&#xA0;</span><span>Crockta&#x2019;s greatsword was pointed at the man&#x2019;s neck. The man slowly opened his eyes. He saw Crockta and the sword pointed at his neck. He didn&#x2019;t know what to do.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Tell me about the divine message.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span><span>Crockta demanded.</span></p><p><span>The man mumbled something.</span></p><p><span>Zakiro felt something strange while watching the scene.&#xA0;</span><span>The man wasn&#x2019;t a great warrior... He was just a fanatic. His sword wasn&#x2019;t exceptional... It was just a decent sword.&#xA0;</span><span>He was like a grain of sand compared to Crockta, a orc &#xA0;with a proper sword.</span></p><p><span>However, when the man used the power of the gods, he could fight against the &#x2018;Northern Conqueror.&#x2019;&#xA0;</span><span>This was the power of the gods.&#xA0;</span><span>Crockta won now, but he would eventually fall. All the gods wanted his death.</span></p><p><span>What if this power was used on a stronger person with a better sword?</span></p><p><span>Crockta and Ogre Slayer...&#xA0;</span><span>The beautiful dance of the two would end soon.&#xA0;</span><span>It was inevitable.&#xA0;</span><span>After all, it wasn&#x2019;t an ogre they were facing.&#xA0;</span><span>The gods...&#xA0;</span><span>No matter how good Ogre Slayer was, it couldn&#x2019;t kill a god.&#xA0;</span><span>However...</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;I want to keep watching.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>As long as the sun still blazed, the last forge wouldn&#x2019;t turn off.&#xA0;</span><span>Likewise, Zakiro hoped that the beautiful combination of Crockta and Ogre Slayer wouldn&#x2019;t end.&#xA0;</span><span>The sword he made was more than a sword, and the harmony with its owner was a miracle he wanted to last forever.</span></p><p><span>Zakiro wanted to do it.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;This is also destiny.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>A warrior had to fight.&#xA0;</span><span>For a warrior to survive, he must kill without dying...&#xA0;</span><span>And in order to kill, he needed a weapon that could kill.</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p><p><a href="www.wuxiaworld.com">Glossary of Common Korean Terms.</a></p><p>Praise the Orc:&#xA0;<a href="docs.google.com">Glossary Link.&#xA0;</a></p><p>Current schedule:&#xA0;There will now be 14 chapters a week, meaning two chapters every day.</p><p>I have also updated my&#xA0;<a href="www.patreon.com">Patreon</a>&#xA0;to reflect my new novels.
