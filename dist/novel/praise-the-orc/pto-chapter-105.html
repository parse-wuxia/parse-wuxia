<p><span>Chapter 105 - Great Northern War (1)</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p><p><span>Crockta shook his head at Zelkian&#x2019;s words.</span></p><p><span>He couldn&#x2019;t become an apostle.&#xA0;</span><span>Crockta already had a star on his forehead. He connected to Elder Lord and became her apostle.&#xA0;</span><span>Furthermore, he didn&#x2019;t want to mortgage his body to someone else.</span></p><p><span>Zelkian looked depressed at Crockta&#x2019;s rejection.</span></p><p><span>&quot;There are many good things if you become an apostle. You can become stronger. You might get nice muscles like me.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>He showed off his burly arm, flexing his muscles to the limit.</span></p><p><span>&quot;I will also reject <em>dot</em>.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span><span>Tiyo replied. Zelkian gazed at Tiyo.&#xA0;</span><span>&quot;If I become an apostle, I will definitely be given duties as well as strength <em>dot</em>.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;That&apos;s right.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;I won&#x2019;t be bound to anyone <em>dot</em>. I will become stronger by myself <em>dot</em>.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Umm...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>The branches of the world tree swayed like tentacles.&#xA0;</span><span>The man&#x2019;s arm was still in the pose. He seemed to be in shock from the continuous rejections.</span></p><p><span>Then Zelkian&#x2019;s gaze landed on Anor.&#xA0;</span><span>Anor was a dark elf. Expectations filled Zelkian&#x2019;s eyes. The world tree was sacred to dark elves, unlike orcs and gnomes. Therefore, any dark elf would consider this opportunity an honor.&#xA0;</span><span>But Anor also smiled and shook his head.</span></p><p><span>&quot;No, why?&quot;&#xA0;</span><span>Zelkian stretched out his arms.&#xA0;</span><span>&#x201C;The opportunity to become an apostle of the world tree isn&#x2019;t given to just anyone. It is a tremendous gift.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;But if I become an apostle of the world tree, will I eventually be bound here?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Of course. It is a blessing to be with the world tree.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Then no.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span><span>Anor looked at Crockta and Tiyo.&#xA0;</span><span>&#x201C;I have to go to the continent with them.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>He had promised Crockta and Tiyo before coming here. Anor hadn&#x2019;t forgotten that they agreed to explore the continent together. It was his most important goal.</span></p><p><span>Zelkian nodded.&#xA0;</span><span>&quot;If it is friendship... it can&#x2019;t be helped.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Zelkian nodded.&#xA0;</span><span>The world tree shook its knotted branches as if it understood.</span></p><p><span>&quot;It will be a little harder but it can&#x2019;t be helped. Don&#x2019;t regret it.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span><span>Zelkian touched the world tree.&#xA0;</span><span>&quot;This was why I called you here, but it can&#x2019;t be helped if you refuse.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>He turned his gaze towards the distant sunset.&#xA0;</span><span>His face was red. Zelkian looked at it for a while before turning around.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Follow me.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>They entered the world tree again.&#xA0;</span><span>They rode a branch downstairs. They reached the upper level of the stairs.</span></p><p><span>Zelkian led them to his office. It was a desolate room with only one desk.&#xA0;</span><span>However, the moment that Crockta&#x2019;s group entered the office, the floor started to rise behind them.&#xA0;</span><span>The wood on the floor created chairs.&#xA0;</span><span>Crockta confirmed with his own eyes what it meant by the world tree creating this place.&#xA0;</span><span>As they sat down in the chair, the table inside the office changed again. In addition, Tiyo&#x2019;s chair rose further so he was at eye level with the others.</span></p><p><span>It was a custom interior.&#xA0;</span><span>Branches representing the will of the world tree also appeared in the office.&#xA0;</span><span>The tentacles moved freely but they were welcoming.</span></p><p><span>&quot;Sit comfortably.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span><span>Zelkian shrugged. They could feel his pride in the power of the world tree.&#xA0;</span><span>&quot;Now let me tell you what to do.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>The table changed. The wooden surface continuously moved up and down, creating a contour.&#xA0;</span><span>It was the north.&#xA0;</span><span>The world tree had created an elaborate embossed map. Crockta&#x2019;s group was filled with admiration. The branches of the world tree hit the table.</span></p><p><span>Zelkian pointed to Spinoa where they were located.</span></p><p><span>&quot;We are here.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span><span>Then he pointed to the south, to the home of the Great Clan.&#xA0;</span><span>&#x201C;The great chieftain is here.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Then he drew an arrow on the table with a pen and marked a path. The area of the orcs was expanding and advancing into the area of the dark elves.&#xA0;</span><span>There were already battles occurring at the boundaries of the dark elf area.</span></p><p><span>&quot;It doesn&apos;t matter. Strategy and tactics aren&#x2019;t important.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span><span>Zelkian drew a circle.&#xA0;</span><span>&quot;They will reach this place in a week.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>He drew a line from the circle and pointed the arrow towards the center of the dark elves.&#xA0;</span><span>Then he wrote down the word &#x2018;monster&#x2019; within the circle.</span></p><p><span>&quot;You have to stop this guy.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>The great chieftain.</span></p><p><span>&quot;Is the great chieftain that strong <em>dot</em>? Aren&#x2019;t you an apostle of the world tree?&#x201D; Tiyo asked.</span></p><p><span>As an apostle of the world tree, it was clear that he had some power. Zelkian shook his head.&#xA0;</span><span>&quot;An apostle isn&#x2019;t invincible. And...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Zelkian stabbed the word monster again with his pen.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;That bastard...I think he is also an apostle.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Apostle?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Yes. A senseless guy.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Apostle, whose apostle is he?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Crockta remembered her. The system had given him an unknown power. If he looked at the name &#x2018;Gray God&apos;s Eyes&#x2019;, it was likely that the woman was the gray god and a fallen god.&#xA0;</span><span>The world tree also seemed to be such a divine being.</span></p><p><span>Was this war a fight between gods?&#xA0;</span><span>Which god gave strength to the great chieftain?</span></p><p><span>&quot;I can&apos;t be sure, since I don&#x2019;t know that much about orcs.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Crockta&#x2019;s Heart and Soul Penetration said that Zelkian had a strong force. There was a formidable strength inside him. &#xA0;</span><span>But Zelkian was seriously wary of the orc chieftain. He seemed to think that the orc chieftain was stronger than him.</span></p><p><span>Crockta spoke, &quot;So what do you want for us? Where should I fight?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>That was the key.&#xA0;</span><span>No matter what his thoughts, they were going to war.&#xA0;</span><span>Once he stepped on the battlefield, they had to be willing to shed the blood of their enemies.&#xA0;</span><span>That was a soldier&#x2019;s mission.</span></p><p><span>&quot;Don&apos;t think too hastily. We will be blocking so slowly...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Crockta cut off Zelkian&#x2019;s words and pointed to Nuridot.&#xA0;</span><span>Then he pointed to the villages on the outskirts one by one.&#xA0;</span><span>Zelkian was silent.&#xA0;</span><span>They were places where fights were already taking place.</span></p><p><span>&quot;We have to think quickly Zelkian. This isn&#x2019;t like playing toy soldiers.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;......&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;The war has already begun. You seem to only be concerned with the orc chieftain, but there are a series of fights where people are dying. I don&#x2019;t want to act leisurely. No, it seems like coming to Spinoa itself is a waste of time.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Tiyo nodded in agreement.</span></p><p><span>&quot;We have to go to the battlefield as soon as possible to avoid unnecessary damage <em>dot</em>. If you only called us to become apostles then we will be going.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Zelkian didn&#x2019;t say anything for a while.&#xA0;</span><span>Then he nodded.</span></p><p><span>&quot;I understand. I&#x2019;ve been acting too leisurely.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span><span>Then he pointed to the branches of the world tree.&#xA0;</span><span>&quot;I&#x2019;m connected to that guy... It seems like I have changed a lot.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>The world tree didn&#x2019;t respond.&#xA0;</span><span>It was a divine presence. Just like humans didn&#x2019;t care about the lives of ants, it might think of the dark elves and orcs as small points on a map.&#xA0;</span><span>Concentrating only one fighting the great chieftain, who seemed to be someone&#x2019;s apostle, reflected that perception.</span></p><p><span>And that wasn&#x2019;t Crockta&#x2019;s point of view.&#xA0;</span><span>The scenery he saw through the map was the sight of those bleeding on the front lines.&#xA0;</span><span>It was the perspective of someone who thought every minute and second was precious.</span></p><p><span>&quot;I&apos;ll give you quick caruks, so be ready to leave tomorrow. Move quickly from Spinoa.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;I understand.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Zelkian&#x2019;s face was relieved like he had changed his mind.&#xA0;</span><span>&quot;It is good that I met you. No one here tells me what to do.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>He laughed bitterly.&#xA0;</span><span>An apostle that communicated with the world tree.&#xA0;</span><span>To the dark elves, he was like an agent of god.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;So...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>At the moment that Zelkian was talking...</span></p><p><i><span>Kukukung!</span></i></p><p><span>The world tree shook.</span></p><p><span>Crockta grabbed the table. </span><span>Tiyo got off the chair and lowered his stance.&#xA0;</span><span>Anor fell over.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;What is happening?&#x201D;&#xA0;</span><span>Crockta asked Zelkian. The branches of the world tree had disappeared like they were sucked somewhere else.</span></p><p><span>His expression was serious.&#xA0;</span><span>&quot;The world tree...attacked.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;What?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Come along.&quot;</span></p><p><span>Zelkian leapt out of his office.&#xA0;</span><span>It was chaos inside the world tree. The dark elves within the world tree were confused.&#xA0;</span><span>But that confusion stopped once Zelkian appeared.</span></p><p><span>&quot;Maintain your positions.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Yes.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Let&#x2019;s go.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Crockta&#x2019;s party followed Zelkian. They climbed the stairs then rode the branch of the world tree.&#xA0;</span><span>The branches of the world tree were waiting for them. It rose in an instant. The movement wasn&#x2019;t slow like earlier.&#xA0;</span><span>They stopped at a point that could be called the center of the world tree. The world tree opened and they went outside.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>On the large branches of the world tree, a sight they never imagined was revealed.</span></p><p><span>&quot;......!&quot;</span></p><p><span>The bodies of wyverns were hanging all over the branches.&#xA0;</span><span>There wasn&#x2019;t just one. The wyverns were twitching as blood poured from their heads. &#xA0;</span><span>The wyverns were wearing steel equipment on their heads and bodies. They flew over a large distance with this equipment and hit the world tree.&#xA0;</span><span>The world tree was broken in places and sap was flowing down. It looked like blood.</span></p><p><span>&quot;There aren&#x2019;t any big injuries. It&#x2019;s okay.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>The moment that Zelkian said this.&#xA0;</span><span>Something started shaking on the wyverns&#x2019; bodies.</span></p><p><span>&quot;......!&quot;</span></p><p><span>Crockta distinctively saw what it was.&#xA0;</span><span>It was the same for Zelkian.&#xA0;</span><span>They didn&#x2019;t speak for a while.</span></p><p><span>&quot;He really is... crazy chieftain <em>dot</em>...&#x201D;&#xA0;</span><span>Tiyo muttered.</span></p><p><span>The wyverns had bundles wrapped around their necks.&#xA0;</span><span>They were...</span></p><p><span>Bizarre necklaces made of the heads of dark elves.&#xA0;</span><span>The soulless faces were staring blankly into the air.&#xA0;</span><span>It wasn&#x2019;t just one or two. It was a terrible necklace made of dozens of dark elves.&#xA0;</span><span>In addition, there were over 10 wyverns.</span></p><p><span>The heads of hundreds of dark elves were delivered t</span><span>owards the world tree.&#xA0;</span><span>It was a warning from the great chieftain.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;That...bastard...&#x201D;&#xA0;</span><span>Zelkian&#x2019;s voice trembled. His hands were shaking.&#xA0;</span><span>A blue light seemed to explode in his eyes.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;That bastard...!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>His voice rang out through Spinoa.&#xA0;</span><span>Zelkian, the apostle of the world tree was angry.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Dare&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>The whole world tree started twitching.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;I will surely kill Calmahart!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Zelkian yelled out.&#xA0;</span><span>Crockta raised a hand to his shoulder. It was meant to calm him down. Anor was already covering his ears due to the loud shouting.&#xA0;</span><span>Zelkian slowly regained his composure.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Hoo...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Zelkian looked at the air. Then he gazed at Crockta.&#xA0;</span><span>Fury was in his eyes.</span></p><p><span>&quot;Crockta. You are right. I was thinking too easily.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span><span>He raised an arm to Crockta&#x2019;s shoulder.&#xA0;</span><span>&quot;I am asking as an apostle of the world tree. Come with us and fight against the crazy chieftain.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Crockta nodded.&#xA0;</span><span>&quot;Of course.&quot;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Thank you.&quot;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;There is no time to delay.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;It seems so.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Then tell me.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span><span>Crockta grinned.&#xA0;</span><span>&quot;Where should I go?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Zelkian closed his eyes. He thought for a moment before opening it again.</span></p><p><span>&quot;Emeranian.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>On the map that the world tree created, it was the place where the most intense battle was occurring.&#xA0;</span><span>The place where the orcs were smashing against.&#xA0;</span><span>The most dangerous front line.</span></p><p><span>Crockta grinned.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;I&#x2019;ll willingly accept.&quot;</span></p><p></p><p style="text-align: center"><span>***</span></p><p></p><p><span>The city on the verge of falling, Emeranian.&#xA0;</span><span>Orc siege weapons were breaking down the walls.</span></p><p><span>There was a shadow walking towards the orcs of the Great Clan.</span></p><p><span>It was...</span></p><p><span>An enormous greatsword that couldn&#x2019;t be ignored.&#xA0;</span><span>A body covered in tattoos.&#xA0;</span><span>An orc warrior.</span></p><p><span>It was the opening day of the Great Northern War.</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p><p><a href="www.wuxiaworld.com">Glossary of Common Korean Terms.</a></p><p>Praise the Orc:&#xA0;<a href="docs.google.com">Glossary Link.&#xA0;</a></p><p>Current schedule:&#xA0;<strong>Next Patreon goal has been reached!!
