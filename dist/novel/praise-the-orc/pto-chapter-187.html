<p><span>Chapter 187 - God Slayer (2)</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p><p><span>Geherad was in turmoil.&#xA0;</span><span>The temple of the sun god, which could be called the reason for Geherad&#x2019;s existence, was on fire.</span></p><p><span>&quot;Everybody evacuate!&quot;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;What is going on?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Fire, fire!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>The first place to react was the worship room.&#xA0;</span><span>The fire started at the altar that contained the last fire and started to spread throughout the temple.&#xA0;</span><span>The worshipers shouted and ran away, along with the guards of the temple. The terrified blacksmiths also left the forge.</span></p><p><span>It was the same for the priest and Crockta&#x2019;s group in the archives. They rushed outside as the temple became hotter.</span></p><p><span>&quot;What is this...?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Oh my god.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;The sun god!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Come this way!&quot;</span></p><p><span>Those who evacuated to the outskirts stared at the temple with devastation.&#xA0;</span><span>Crockta gazed at the temple.&#xA0;</span><span>It seemed like the entire building was on fire.&#xA0;</span><span>Nevertheless, the temple itself didn&#x2019;t combust. The whole temple felt like a melting fire pit but nothing was destroyed. Even the flags flying from the temple maintained their intact appearance.&#xA0;</span><span>It maintained its intact appearance despite being surrounded by a red flame.</span></p><p><span>The priest muttered,&#xA0;</span><span>&#x201C;The sun will burn his enemy and wrap itself around his children. To those who don&#x2019;t believe in him, he is the plague of hell.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>People looked at him.</span></p><p><span>&quot;This is the power of the sun god. His flame is said to burn the enemies, while not harming those who weren&#x2019;t enemies.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Ahh...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Is the sun god waking up? This is obviously his power.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Perhaps finally...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>The huge temple was burning while maintaining its appearance.&#xA0;</span><span>It was an unbelievable sight that couldn&#x2019;t be understood unless the power of a god were involved.&#xA0;</span><span>People started to talk about the resurrection of the sun god.</span></p><p><span>Then someone said,&#xA0;</span><span>&quot;No, that isn&apos;t the case.&quot;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Rastad?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>It was Rastad.&#xA0;</span><span>There was an unknown expression on his face. It was both jubilant and bittersweet.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;That isn&#x2019;t the resurrection of the sun god.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Huh?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;It is the last forge.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Everyone staring blankly at him.&#xA0;</span><span>Only the priest nodded like he understood,&#xA0;</span><span>&#x201C;I understand. It is the last forge.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;What do you mean?&quot; Wasn&#x2019;t the last forge the place where we were?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>One blacksmith asked Rastad.&#xA0;</span><span>Rastad shook his head.</span></p><p><span>&quot;That is just a room next to the worship room. The true last forge is somewhere else, and it isn&#x2019;t a place we can use whenever we want. It is a legendary forge that appears when the last fire burns.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span><span>Now there was a clear smile on his face.&#xA0;</span><span>&#x201C;There are three conditions necessary to truly use the last forge. It will appear when the world needs the last forge, when a worthy craftsman puts the iron into the furnace and... </span></p><p><span>He looked at Crockta, who flinched.&#xA0;</span><span>Rastad smiled so widely that his canine teeth were revealed.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;When a warrior who deserves a weapon made in the last forge is met. The last forge will only appear then.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Rastad finished speaking and fell silent.&#xA0;</span><span>It was a sight that he might never see again in his life.</span></p><p><span>At that moment.&#xA0;</span><span>It started to rain.</span></p><p><i><span>Chiiiik!</span></i></p><p><span>Steam appeared as the fire around the temple and the rain met. The entire temple was covered in steam, making it not visible anymore.&#xA0;</span><span>Consecutive scenes that were hard to believe appeared.&#xA0;</span><span>Then they heard the sound of iron being hit.</span></p><p><i><span>Kaaang!</span></i></p><p><span>The sound became bigger.</span></p><p><i><span>Kaaang!</span></i></p><p><span>There was the blazing temple, pouring rain and hammering sound that rang out all over Geherad.</span></p><p><i><span>Kaaang!</span></i></p><p></p><p style="text-align: center"><span>***</span></p><p></p><p><span>After the divine message was received, public opinion wandered for a while but it gradually moved towards a conclusion.&#xA0;</span><span>All temples followed the will of their gods and designated Crockta as an enemy to be destroyed.</span></p><p><span>&quot;I never thought the day would come when all gods would whisper the same words.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span><span>A man wearing steel armor said.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>Duke Christian of the empire looked at him.</span></p><p><span>&quot;It is a chance I never thought would come in my life. I am going.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>The man standing in front of him was one of Christian&#x2019;s subordinates.&#xA0;</span><span>He was an important talent, a person that Christian didn&#x2019;t spare any support for and was placed right below him. The strongest magician Mogsulin was one of his representatives.</span></p><p><span>It was the same for the man in front of him, a paladin chosen by the god of war. Using the god of war&#x2019;s blessing, Aklan wiped out all enemies in front of him.&#xA0;</span><span>He welcomed this divine message more than anyone else. He wanted to get rid of Crockta and the orcs as soon as possible.</span></p><p><span>His determined eyes proved this.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Hrmm, I see.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span><span>Christian thought about it.</span></p><p><span>The deeply religious elves and dwarves were already preparing to march.&#xA0;</span><span>It was a divine message so volunteer troops gathered together. Those who knew how to fight, the soldiers and those who wanted to win gathered together.&#xA0;</span><span>It wasn&#x2019;t just due to the divine message but also the ambition to distinguish themselves in a great cause. Those who wanted to know themselves and acquire honor lined up.&#xA0;</span><span>The goal was Orcrox in the land of the orcs.</span></p><p><span>The man standing here, Aklan, was a person filled with both honor and faith in his god.</span></p><p><span>&quot;If that is your will, I can&#x2019;t stop you.&#x201D; Duke Christian replied.&#xA0;</span><span>He spoke negatively to the emperor about this fight, but he also thought it was important.&#xA0;</span><span>However, he didn&#x2019;t want to follow the trend. He was the person throwing the fire, not the one who caught on fire.</span></p><p><span>And Aklan was the best person to set fire to.&#xA0;</span><span>He believed in the god of war. That was the reason for Aklan&#x2019;s existence.&#xA0;</span><span>This fanaticism would spread to people like a disease.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Adandator wants to accompany me.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Adandator?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Yes.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Adandator had been injured in the battle against Crockta.&#xA0;</span><span>Was it due to vengeance? Or maybe Aklan&#x2019;s madness had moved him.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Okay.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>It didn&#x2019;t matter. Adandator was a person close to the emperor. He didn&#x2019;t have a large relationship with Christian.</span></p><p><span>&quot;Please understand, I can&#x2019;t send the regular armies and knights. It is because it is the emperor, not the gods, that is at the top of the empire.&#x201D; Christian explained.</span></p><p><span>&quot;I know.&quot;</span></p><p><span>&quot;But that doesn&#x2019;t mean you can&#x2019;t recruit volunteers. Gather people from the temple of the war god. Try whatever you can. I will speak to the emperor. If the soldiers want to go, they will be able to.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Thank you.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span><span>Aklan bowed deeply.&#xA0;</span><span>&quot;I will return to pay back all your grace.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Don&#x2019;t worry about that. Bring back victory. That is enough.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Yes!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Then please go.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span><span>Aklan rose, bowed once more to Christian and turned around.</span></p><p><span>Christian watched him leave and thought.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&apos;Please spread this war so that everyone will become wounded, and there is no clear winner.&apos;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;The orcs will truly cease to exist. Then the balance of the continent will fall.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Create a shocking and exciting upheaval.</span></p><p><span>Christian smiled.&#xA0;</span><span>&quot;What do you think?&quot;</span></p><p><span>Then a man standing next to Duke Christian revealed himself. The robed man was the great magician, Mogsulin.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;The orcs will disappear from the continent.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Aren&#x2019;t there monsters among the orcs?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;They are monsters, but their opponents are gods. All the gods are hostile to the orcs. Who can survive?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Indeed.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;It can&#x2019;t be helped, even if the fallen god is behind them.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>According to Mogsulin, the power of the fallen god was felt strongly from Crockta when he fought the empire, making the gods take this action.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;I&#x2019;m glad you are here.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Mogsulin had touched the Pinnacle and was linked to the gods. He overheard the stories of the gods and told Christian.&#xA0;</span><span>Without Mogsulin, he wouldn&#x2019;t have known all of this.&#xA0;</span><span>Mogsulin smiled and bowed at Christian&#x2019;s praise.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;But what will happen if that Crockta wins? He has succeeded in doing things that seem impossible. He is an orc but I admire him. No matter how great the gods are, I can&#x2019;t help feeling uneasy.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;This time, even he&#x2019;s unable to do anything. He might be the best fighter who defeated Adandator, but the gods aren&#x2019;t existences that can be killed with swords.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Those who can&#x2019;t be killed by swords...how reliable.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Christian laughed.&#xA0;</span><span>People all over the continent were following the divine message.&#xA0;</span><span>This was a great opportunity for those like Christian.</span></p><p></p><p style="text-align: center"><span>***</span></p><p></p><p><span>The rain didn&#x2019;t stop falling in Geherad.&#xA0;</span><span>Nevertheless, the flames around the temple didn&#x2019;t go out. People tried to approach the temple but couldn&#x2019;t enter due to the heat. An extraordinary event was going on.</span></p><p><span>In addition, the banging sound continued to ring through Geherad.</span></p><p><i><span>Kaaang!</span></i></p><p><i><span>Kaaang!</span></i></p><p><span>&quot;Zakiro, is he alive?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;We can still hear the sound...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Has he eaten <em>dot</em>?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;......&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;What a great guy, <em>dot</em>. If I was him, I would die from hunger. Ohh.&#x201D;</span></p><p><i><span>Kaaang!</span></i></p><p><span>According to the priest and Rastad, Zakiro was currently making a weapon with the last fire. A type of divine power had descended.&#xA0;</span><span>However, Crockta, Tiyo, and Anor focused on eating as the crazy blacksmith hammered on the iron.</span></p><p><span>The interior was very hot so Zakiro might already be burned.&#xA0;</span><span>Fortunately, the knocking sound continued but it was unknown if he was perfectly safe. This was a problem that continued all day.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;By the way, my father said he was going north <em>dot</em>.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;That&#x2019;s right,&#x201D; said the priest as he drank his beer.</span></p><p><span>Due to the burning temple, the priest lost his home and stayed with Crockta&#x2019;s group at the inn for a while.&#xA0;</span><span>There was no rule against priests drinking alcohol. The excited priest drank the beer. He maintained good manners but he was still a dwarf.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;I remember him saying it in passing. He is seeking a person who knows the myths in the north.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;My dad really is a wanderer <em>dot</em>.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>They pursued him from the north to the south, then the west and now they were heading north again.&#xA0;</span><span>It was traveling all around the continent.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;But this time, the north...&#x201D;&#xA0;</span><span>Tiyo looked at Crockta and asked, &quot;Won&#x2019;t the land of the orcs appear <em>dot</em>?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Indeed,&#x201D; Crockta nodded in agreement.&#xA0;</span><span>If they headed north from Geherad, Orcrox and Basque Village would appear.&#xA0;</span><span>Their destination was there, as if someone was intentionally leading them.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;It has been a really long time since I&#x2019;ve returned home.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>The place where everything began, Orcrox.&#xA0;</span><span>Crockta was filled with a burning desire to go back there.</span></p><p><span>&quot;By the way, when will Zakiro finish the sword? I&#x2019;m looking forward to it.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Me too <em>dot</em>. Crockta is great, isn&#x2019;t this like a divine sword?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Do you think it might be a legendary sword?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>They looked at Crockta.&#xA0;</span><span>All of this was happening due to Crockta&#x2019;s Ogre Slayer. What type of weapon would be created?&#xA0;</span><span>Crockta scratched his head and said, &quot;Uhh...well...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>He wasn&#x2019;t sure.&#xA0;</span><span>He expected a great weapon, but it became somewhat burdensome due to the burning temple, steam and knocking sound.</span></p><p><span>At that moment, a dwarf sitting in the next chair asked, &quot;Hey, can you hear that sound anymore?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>The sound of iron being hammered had stopped.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;......&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>It was quiet.&#xA0;</span><span>Everyone got up in excitement.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Perhaps!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;This!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Let&#x2019;s go <em>dot</em>!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>The group left the inn.&#xA0;</span><span>It was still raining.&#xA0;</span><span>In the rain, the temple lost the fire and steam, gradually returning to its original appearance. The flames around the temple that surprised Geherad faded.</span></p><p><span>Crockta&#x2019;s group ran towards the temple. As they approached, they saw a man appear at the door of the temple.&#xA0;</span><span>It was Zakiro. His body was covered in soot but his eyes were shining. He found Crockta and started to walk over, his steps filled with exhaustion.</span></p><p><span>He was holding a greatsword in his hand.</span></p><p><span>Crockta approached and faced him.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;...Good work.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Zakiro stopped, looked up at Crockta, and laughed.&#xA0;</span><span>Words weren&#x2019;t necessary.&#xA0;</span><span>Zakiro, a blacksmith of the Golden Anvil Clan, a genius who received the title of &#x2018;Slayer Maker&#x2019; at a young age.&#xA0;</span><span>He handed over the weapon that he poured everything into.</span></p><p><span>&quot;......!&quot;</span></p><p><span>Crockta realized it the moment he received the new sword.&#xA0;</span><span>This wasn&#x2019;t a normal greatsword.&#xA0;</span><span>He knew it.&#xA0;</span><span>It was more than a weapon.&#xA0;</span><span>The standards that he knew about swords were all broken, and he felt like he could cause a miracle just holding this sword.</span></p><p><span>The perfect gift for a warrior.&#xA0;</span><span>Crockta wielded it before looking at Zakiro with a shiver.&#xA0;</span><span>How should he show his appreciation to the blacksmith who created this?</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Zakiro...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Crockta opened his mouth.&#xA0;</span><span>His mouth opened and closed.&#xA0;</span><span>Crockta was speechless as he suppressed his emotions.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Geez, something like this...&#x201D;</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p><p><a href="www.wuxiaworld.com">Glossary of Common Korean Terms.</a></p><p>Praise the Orc:&#xA0;<a href="docs.google.com">Glossary Link.&#xA0;</a></p><p>Current schedule:&#xA0;There will now be 14 chapters a week, meaning two chapters every day.</p><p>I have also updated my&#xA0;<a href="www.patreon.com">Patreon</a>&#xA0;to reflect my new novels.
