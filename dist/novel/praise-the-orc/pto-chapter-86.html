<p><span>Chapter 86 - Alive (4)</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p><p><span>Anor trimmed off both of his ears. </span><span>The dark elf&#x2019;s unique ears were half cut. The appearance was straight like an elf, but it was a size similar to a human.&#xA0;</span><span>It was a strange appearance that wasn&#x2019;t a dark elf or human.</span></p><p><span>Black energy emerged from Anor&#x2019;s body.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;......!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Karmat instinctively recoiled.&#xA0;</span><span>The black energy was an aura of death that frightened all of the living.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;This...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>He looked through his memories.&#xA0;</span><span>Surely not.&#xA0;</span><span>This was a strength that was said to be cut off a long time ago in the north.</span></p><p><span>&quot;Dammit...&quot;</span></p><p><span>Someone grabbed his feet.&#xA0;</span><span>He looked down.&#xA0;</span><span>The dead Nakai had risen and stabbed a dagger in his calf. Karmat dropped down.</span></p><p><span>&quot;Kuaaaak!&quot;</span></p><p><span>He grabbed Nakai&#x2019;s head but the undead didn&#x2019;t feel any pain so the arm kept moving mechanically. </span><i><span>Puok, puok. </span></i><span>The dagger kept on being stabbed in his calves. Karmat threw Nakai away desperately.</span></p><p><span>Nakai&#x2019;s body squirmed as it hit the wall. He got up again with a rattle. The bones moved strangely due to being forced out of place from the impact, but he kept on walking back to Karmat.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Necromancer!&#x201D; shouted Karmat to his men.</span></p><p><span>He looked around.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;......!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>One of his men was hanging upside down in the air.&#xA0;</span><span>The drake they killed got up again and was chewing on the head of an orc.</span></p><p><span>&quot;Dammit...&quot;</span></p><p><span>He was a warrior and a shaman.&#xA0;</span><span>He could see the deep concentration of magic power in Anor&#x2019;s eyes.&#xA0;</span><span>It was the magic of death. How did this guy show up? This wasn&#x2019;t an opponent he could match with his magic power.</span></p><p><span>&quot;Then the way to deal with this opponent...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>He gripped his axe tightly. However, it was difficult to get rid of the undead clinging to his ankles. His body staggered.&#xA0;</span><span>He needed to kill that guy.</span></p><p><span>Anor stared at him blankly. Karma gritted his teeth. His companions were approaching. Okay. It was possible if there were several of them.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Come. We are both...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>But there was something more.&#xA0;</span><span>He looked at his approaching companions.&#xA0;</span><span>Their eyes were vacant.</span></p><p><span>&quot;Dammit...&quot;</span></p><p><span>Karmat&#x2019;s men were slain by the drake and were now heading towards him in an antagonistic manner. Their hands lifted the axes up high.</span></p><p><span>Karmat shouted, &#x201C;The rest! Retreat! Retreat! Join with the ones who are still searching!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>The orc warriors stopped fighting and moved quickly. One of them helped Karmat.&#xA0;</span><span>The undead chased them, but their speed was so slow that they couldn&#x2019;t catch up.&#xA0;</span><span>The orc warriors stampeded out of the hall.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;......&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Once again, a dead silence filled the area.&#xA0;</span><span>The dark elves shook in fear of Anor. They all avoided his gaze.</span></p><p><span>&quot;Just like his mother...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Cursed blood...&#x201D; Some of them whispered.</span></p><p><span> Anor could hear all of it.&#xA0;</span><span>Anor turned towards the exit.&#xA0;</span><span>He didn&#x2019;t want to be here anymore.</span></p><p><span>Just before he left the hall, someone grabbed his clothing and said, &#x201C;W-Wait a minute.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;......?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Anor turned his head.&#xA0;</span><span>A female dark elf was behind him. She was part of Nakai&#x2019;s group that always looked at him with scornful eyes.&#xA0;</span><span>He wondered if she was coming to apologize.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;If you go away...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;....?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;What do we do if the orcs come back? You should stay here...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>The other dark elves in the hall nodded. They were afraid of Anor, but they still hoped he would stay here as their protector.</span></p><p><span>Anor looked up at the sky for a moment.&#xA0;</span><span>He didn&#x2019;t think for long.</span></p><p><span>He immediately kicked her in the abdomen, causing her to fall flat on her face.</span></p><p><span>Anor spat at her and said, &quot;Get lost, you crazy bitch.&#x201D;</span></p><p></p><p style="text-align: center"><span>***</span></p><p></p><p><span>Ogre Slayer broke the neck of an orc warrior trying to cross the barrier. Blood poured out. Crockta used his whole body to swing his greatsword again.</span></p><p><span>He was protecting the outer barriers of Nuridot.&#xA0;</span><span>The dark elves were resisting. Arrows flew over the barrier and pierced an orc.</span></p><p><span>The orcs didn&#x2019;t stop despite being hit by a few arrows. Rather, they gave a sharp battle cry to raise their strength. The pain turned to hatred. The hatred was infused in their axes as they jumped towards the barrier.</span></p><p><span>The orcs pushed into the barrier and the dark elves shrank back.</span></p><p><span>At that moment, a huge roar was heard.&#xA0;</span><span>&quot;Bul&#x2019;tarrrrrrrrr&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>The footsteps of the orcs hesitated.&#xA0;</span><span>It was like a giant wind was pushing behind them as the fighting spirit of the dark elves rose. The enemies retreated one step like they were caught in the wind.&#xA0;</span><span>Crockta&#x2019;s shout was an excellent weapon that increased his allies&#x2019; morale.</span></p><p><span>The battlefield became stagnant in that moment.&#xA0;</span><span>The orcs and dark elves paused at the collapsing barrier. The two sides couldn&#x2019;t attack carelessly.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;You monster.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>As a barrier collapsed, an orc warrior walked towards Nuridot&#x2019;s line of defense.&#xA0;</span><span>It was the commander of the Nuridot invasion, Urok. </span></p><p><span>He grinned at Crockta and said, &quot;You are a great warrior. Are you called Crockta?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Um.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Dark elves, thank this warrior. If it weren&#x2019;t for him, you would already be defeated by us.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Urok was overflowing with confidence.&#xA0;</span><span>It was difficult to understand considering that the Nuridot invasion wasn&#x2019;t flowing his way. Crockta looked around. Was there a tactic that he was hiding?&#xA0;</span><span>There were obviously many orc warriors, but the dark elves were resisting.&#xA0;</span><span>If he added his own actions, this battle would eventually lead to Nuridot&#x2019;s victory. The warrior Urok had to know this.</span></p><p><span>Crockta couldn&#x2019;t suppress his anxiety.</span></p><p><span>&quot;Crockta, won&#x2019;t you join our Great Clan?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;There was someone who already made that offer.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span><span>Crockta said with a smile.</span></p><p><span>The leader of the wandering orcs had asked him to join the Great Clan.&#xA0;</span><span>Crockta had replied by cutting him from his head to his crotch.</span></p><p><span>Urok had also witnessed this.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;He did, that is true, but I am not like that guy. I am someone who has received the title of warrior directly from the great chieftain, Calmahart. Not just you, but that gnome will also be accepted as one of us.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>The name came out again.&#xA0;</span><span>Crockta&#x2019;s eyes narrowed.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Don&apos;t make me laugh. The north truly is different from the continent, Crockta,&#x201D; muttered Tiyo from beside Crockta. </span></p><p><span>Crockta started laughing.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&quot;There are also some dirty bastards there.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Didn&#x2019;t you speak to Hammerchwi?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;There are also people like Hammerchwi. And they all died.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span><span>Crockta grinned.&#xA0;</span><span>&quot;There is no need to remember their names, the poor bastards.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Now matter how strong or skilled they were, it was worthless against Crockta.&#xA0;</span><span>Rather, the name of Caburak from Orcheim was more valuable, despite him losing all his power.</span></p><p><span>The law of the Great Clan that cut everything with force was just the calculations of a beast. It wasn&#x2019;t what made an orc an orc.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;It will be the same for you too.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;You are a dangerous person, Crockta. Kuhahahat.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Urok laughed one more time before whispering to an orc by his side. The person nodded before pulling out a bow and arrow.&#xA0;</span><span>The bow was a weapon that didn&#x2019;t go well with orcs. Crockta watched carefully.</span></p><p><span>The arrowhead aimed towards the sky.&#xA0;</span><span>At that moment, Crockta picked up an axe from the corpse of an orc warrior on the ground and threw it.&#xA0;</span><span>The axe spun as it flew.&#xA0;</span><span>However, the arrow was already too far.&#xA0;</span><span>The arm of the orc shooter was cut off at the same time that the fire arrow flew into the sky. He screamed as blood poured out.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;You noticed pretty quickly,&#x201D; said Urok.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;What did you do?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Don&#x2019;t think that the great chieftain is blind like other orcs, Crockta. He can see everything on the battlefield. He is a true warlord among the orcs.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span><span>Urok raised his axe to the sky.&#xA0;</span><span>&quot;By now, a shaman of the Great Clan will be sneaking troops into Nuridot and killing its worthless dark elves.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;......!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Crockta and the dark elves were shocked.</span></p><p><span>&quot;Surrender if you don&#x2019;t want any more meaningless slaughter.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>The dark elves were agitated. Some fidgeted like they wanted to return to the town right away.&#xA0;</span><span>Their families were there. The morale of the militia dropped rapidly. A sense of helplessness spread, like they were already defeated.</span></p><p><span>&quot;Stop right now!&quot; shouted Nadia.&#xA0;</span><span>&#x201C;Let&#x2019;s stop and talk. Urok! If you have a conscience, you shouldn&#x2019;t kill civilians who aren&#x2019;t guilty of anything!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Urok laughed at Nadia, &quot;Conscience? Our conscience isn&#x2019;t like that.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>As Urok gestured, the orcs picked up their weapons again. The short cease-fire was over.&#xA0;</span><span>&quot;Inflicting a painful death or be killed, that is our conscience.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;......!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;The great warrior Karmat, who entered Nuridot, is a madman without a conscience. Kulkulkul!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Urok walked forward. Dark elves aimed arrows from above.&#xA0;</span><span>However, the arrows were shaking. Their minds were already filled with worry about the rear. The faces of their family overlapped with the orc in front of them.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Wait!&#x201D; Nadia shouted.</span></p><p><span>Crockta looked at her. Their eyes met. Nadia had an apologetic expression on her face.&#xA0;</span><span>She struggled and bit her lips before eventually declaring her surrender.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;I surrender, so stop the attack on the rear.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Hoh.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;I will surrender.&quot;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Then drop your weapons.&quot;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Once the safety of the residents...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Then the battle will continue. Listen to the power of weapons.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>The orcs started laughing.&#xA0;</span><span>They were certain of their victory. The Great Clan had gained dominance by being crueler than anyone else.&#xA0;</span><span>What they were doing now wasn&#x2019;t a war, but closer to a massacre.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Everybody...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>The moment that Urok was about to order the attack, Nadia abandoned her weapon.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;......!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>She looked around at the other dark elves.&#xA0;</span><span>She didn&#x2019;t say anything, but everybody understood her meaning. One by one, the militia started to discard their weapons. Now the dark elves had no more weapons.</span></p><p><span>Crockta and Tiyo were the only ones left.</span></p><p><span>&quot;Isn&#x2019;t this a little unfair?&#x201D; Tiyo asked. </span></p><p><span>Crockta shrugged.</span></p><p><span>&quot;What will you do, Crockta?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Hrmm...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Crockta wondered if he should continue or leave Nuridot and escape.&#xA0;</span><span>He hadn&#x2019;t thought the dark elves would be so naive.</span></p><p><span>&quot;Oh, Karmat is coming,&#x201D; Urok said.</span></p><p><span>Everyone turned around.&#xA0;</span><span>A series of orc warriors were coming from the town. Their weapons were bloody.&#xA0;</span><span>The faces of the dark elves stiffened.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Don&#x2019;t worry, dark elves. &#xA0;I told him not to kill everyone, so some of your family members will be alive.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>The word &apos;some&#x2019; raised hope and despair in them. It made the dark elves more enthusiastic.&#xA0;</span><span>Now the dark elves were looking at Crockta and Tiyo like they were urging them.</span></p><p><span>&#x2018;Discard your weapon and surrender&#x2019; was in their eyes.</span></p><p><span>Crockta narrowed his eyes. He felt dirty. He couldn&#x2019;t understand their minds, and he didn&#x2019;t like this change of attitude.&#xA0;</span><span>Tiyo felt the same and raised General even more.&#xA0;</span><span>They were companions who had fought together. They didn&#x2019;t even need to look at each other to know what they were thinking. Crockta nodded and was about to raise his greatsword.</span></p><p><span>Then someone said, &quot;Wow, this situation looks absurd.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>It was a carefree voice.&#xA0;</span><span>Everybody looked back.</span></p><p><span>The voice spoke again, &quot;What are you looking at, you fucking bastards.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>A dark elf was walking behind the orc warriors coming from the town. The dark elf seemed weak.&#xA0;</span><span>But the voice wasn&#x2019;t coming from an orc.&#xA0;</span><span>The orcs&#x2019; eyes were dead.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;You shouldn&#x2019;t do this to guests you invited to help, you crazy bastards.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>The dark elf stood among the orcs.&#xA0;</span><span>It was a terrible looking elf with blood coming from his cut ears.&#xA0;</span><span>The calm voice didn&#x2019;t match the curses that were being spat out. It was an awkward tone that didn&#x2019;t match the threat.</span></p><p><span>&quot;I&#x2019;m playing with dogs.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>It was Anor.&#xA0;</span><span>Somehow, his eyes looked different. He raised a hand and all the orc warriors lifted their weapons. Crockta realized that they were similar to the undead that he saw in Orcrox&#x2019;s dungeon.</span></p><p><span>Crockta started laughing.&#xA0;</span><span>He didn&#x2019;t know what was happening, but,</span></p><p><span>&#x2018;I tried to live well only to be bullied like I was doing something wrong. I am the one suffering, so why do I have to change? Isn&#x2019;t there something wrong with this?&#x2019;</span></p><p><span>The Anor right now seemed better than the one who had once whispered whispered those words.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;You are alive.&#x201D;</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p><p><a href="www.wuxiaworld.com">Glossary of Common Korean Terms.</a></p><p>Praise the Orc:&#xA0;<a href="docs.google.com">Glossary Link.&#xA0;</a></p><p>Current schedule:&#xA0;<strong>Next Patreon goal has been reached!!
