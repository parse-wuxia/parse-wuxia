<p><span>Chapter 193 - The Swamp (2)</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p><p><span>The snake that was hit by Zankus&#x2019; arrow disappeared into the swamp forest. Only a red blood stain remained where the snake was.&#xA0;</span><span>Crockta&#x2019;s group gazed at the place where the snake disappeared and then looked at each other. It was a humid place that gave off an eerie feeling.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Should we continue <em>dot</em>?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Where else should we go?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Call back the thunderbird...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x2018;Chirpppppppp...!&#x2019;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;......&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Crockta cleared his throat and stepped forward first.&#xA0;</span><span>He realized it when he took the first step. His boots sank down a little bit. It was slippery mud, but not enough to stop them from walking.</span></p><p><span>&quot;We can walk.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span><span>He stepped into the forest with all his weight.&#xA0;</span><span>&quot;It feels bad.&quot;</span></p><p><span>The air was humid. It felt like poisonous insects would appear out of nowhere.&#xA0;</span><span>Crockta walked a few steps and waved his hand.&#xA0;</span><span>He watched the place where the snake was hiding. The serpent&#x2019;s blood remained and the bark and vegetation that it touched was being corroded away.&#xA0;</span><span>It was an awful poison.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;The serpent.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span><span>Crockta looked back at the party and said, &quot;Let&#x2019;s pass through it quickly. Be careful.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>However, their expressions weren&#x2019;t bright. Rather, they seemed surprised. Tiyo pointed to Crockta with his mouth open.&#xA0;</span><span>Crockta shrugged and said, &#x201C;What? Is everybody scared? Only this much...&#x201D;</span></p><p><i><span>Dduk.</span></i></p><p><span>Suddenly, something fell on his shoulders.&#xA0;</span><span>Crockta raised his head.</span></p><p><i><span>Shaaaah-!</span></i></p><p><span>A giant snake&#x2019;s mouth was wide up open towards Crockta. Venom was dripping from the sharp fangs. &#xA0;</span><span>Crockta was so surprised that he couldn&#x2019;t make a sound. The snake gradually approached. Poison dripped from its fangs.&#xA0;</span><span>Crockta couldn&#x2019;t express his surprise but instinctively swung his sword.</span></p><p><span>&quot;Waaahhhhhhhh!&quot;</span></p><p><span>The moment he wielded God Slayer,</span></p><p><i><span>Shaaaah!</span></i></p><p><span>The snake was frightened and twisted its head but it ended up slashed in half.&#xA0;</span><span>Crockta hurriedly avoided it, but it was inevitable that some blood touched his body. Pain radiated from where the poisonous blood had hit.</span></p><p><span>Crockta hurriedly rushed away from the radius of the dying snake.&#xA0;</span><span>He touched his shoulder. The skin was melted due to the poisonous liquid. The poison continued to cause pain. His face distorted.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Kuk, this snake bastard...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Pain and anger jumbled together. He lifted God Slayer and slashed the snake again and again.&#xA0;</span><span>The snake was eventually cut into dozens of pieces.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Pant, pant.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Crockta took deep breaths.&#xA0;</span><span>Tiyo carefully approached and asked, &quot;A-are you okay <em>dot</em>...?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;The place where the poison touched it a little painful.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Poison? I have no knowledge about poison <em>dot</em>.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Zankus spoke, &#x201C;Show me your shoulders.&quot;</span></p><p><span>A hunter probably knew about different types of serpents. He looked at both the snake&#x2019;s body and Crockta&#x2019;s shoulder before pulling something out.</span></p><p><span>&quot;Oh, is there an antidote <em>dot</em>?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;It isn&#x2019;t an antidote but any experienced hunter would know...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>It was a potion.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Potions are the best.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Zankus sprinkled the potion on Crockta&#x2019;s shoulder. Then the pain began. Potions were truly the best against poison.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Indeed, potions are the best.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;It is a good idea to buy a lot when there is a discount.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span>&quot;I will remember that.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Crockta sprinkled potions on every painful spot on his body.</span></p><p><span>&quot;Anyway, it isn&#x2019;t easy.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span><span>Zankus looked at the forest and said.&#xA0;</span><span>There were two huge snakes from the beginning. In addition, they had terrible poison. It would be dangerous.&#xA0;</span><span>However, nobody said to go back.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Break through the front. That is our way <em>dot</em>.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Tiyo lifted General in a ready stance and moved forward.&#xA0;</span><span>Crockta, Zankus, and Anor followed.&#xA0;</span><span>After entering the swamp, the ecology had completely changed.&#xA0;</span><span>The animals and creatures had disappeared, leaving only strange insects and plants that they saw for the first time.</span></p><p><span>&quot;This is a more dangerous place than the ogres&#x2019; habitat in the great forest.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>The dangers in this swamp went beyond the level of being threatened by ogres.&#xA0;</span><span>It wasn&#x2019;t a physical threat, but the insects and unknown ecology weren&#x2019;t something Crockta&#x2019;s group had experienced before.&#xA0;</span><span>A snake biting them out of nowhere was scarier than a dozen ogres.</span></p><p><span>&quot;Be careful...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Tiyo and Crockta took the lead, Anor was in the middle and Zankus followed in the rear.&#xA0;</span><span>Crockta gazed at the shaded forest and walked carefully. The mud of the swamp grabbed at their feet with every step.</span></p><p><span>&quot;Crockta, to the right!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>All of a sudden, Zankus shouted.&#xA0;</span><span>Crockta immediately pulled out his greatsword and swung it to the right.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Kuaaaang!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>This time, it was a leopard. Patterns covered its entire body. Once the surprise attack failed, the leopard landed on the ground and gazed at Crockta.</span></p><p><span>&quot;A leopard is attacking me.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Crockta laughed.&#xA0;</span><span>He was a friend of the great tiger Simba, the king of the forest.</span></p><p><span>&quot;Get lost. Then I will spare your life.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Perhaps it felt the terrible pressure coming from Crockta, but the leopard started to flee.&#xA0;</span><span>It was at that moment.&#xA0;</span><span>On the floor where nothing seemed to be present, something bit the leopard. The long and fat body entwined around the leopard in a flash.</span></p><p><span>It was a snake.&#xA0;</span><span>The leopard was unable to resist and became the snake&#x2019;s prey. The snake bit the leopard and then looked at Crockta&#x2019;s group. </span><span>Crockta&#x2019;s mouth twisted as he lifted God Slayer.&#xA0;</span><span>The snake realized it couldn&#x2019;t afford to go against them and turned away. The leopard&#x2019;s dead body disappeared somewhere along with the snake.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;This is a really dangerous place.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>A place where camouflaged enemies awaited their prey.&#xA0;</span><span>That was this place, the swamp.</span></p><p><span>&quot;Wait a minute.&quot;&#xA0;</span><span>Anor said, telling them to shut up.&#xA0;</span><span>&quot;From the snake who just left...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Before Anor could finish speaking, the sparrow on his head flew to a certain place.&#xA0;</span><span>It was the direction that the snake had disappeared in.</span></p><p><span>&quot;What <em>dot</em>? Did you send it?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;No. It is moving at will.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;What <em>dot</em>?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Well, I can feel something from the direction that the snake left in.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span><span>Anor looked in that direction with a determined face.&#xA0;</span><span>&quot;There is something there. I don&#x2019;t know exactly what.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;It is something related to a necromancer, perhaps a dungeon or artifact.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Zankus nodded. Tiyo shouted.</span></p><p><span>&quot;Okay, then we should go there <em>dot</em>!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;I wonder what will happen.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Kulkulkul, it is a new adventure.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Anor was baffled,&#xA0;</span><span>&quot;No, I mean, it will be dangerous...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Anor! Let&#x2019;s go dot! Lead the way!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;I was saying be careful and don&#x2019;t go...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Guide us <em>dot</em>!&#x201D;</span></p><p></p><p style="text-align: center"><span>***</span></p><p></p><p><span>They went through the swamp for a while.&#xA0;</span><span>Zankus examined the tracks on the ground; his hunter&#x2019;s eyes found signs of snakes in many places.&#xA0;</span><span>The snakes were heading in the direction that Anor felt the power.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;What will it be <em>dot</em>? Perhaps you are just imagining it?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;No. There is definitely something.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Crockta looked around.&#xA0;</span><span>In fact, he also felt something.&#xA0;</span><span>The Demon&#x2019;s Mouth around his waist was rattling.&#xA0;</span><span>It hadn&#x2019;t woken up in a while. The guy inside was still asleep, but the belt was dragging him in the same direction as Anor&#x2019;s feeling. It felt like he was being pulled.&#xA0;</span><span>There was a feeling that something might be on the other end.</span></p><p><span>&quot;There.&quot;</span></p><p><span>And there really was something.</span></p><p><span>A stone pyramid greeted them. It was covered with moss and bushes, but it was definitely a pyramid. The scale was greater than they imagined.&#xA0;</span><span>The snake they pursued was also near the pyramid. In addition to that, there were several snakes crawling around the pyramid.</span></p><p><span>&quot;There must be something in that pyramid.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span><span>Zankus was already giving an interested smiled.&#xA0;</span><span>&quot;The entrance is there. Is it locked?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>There was a doorway under the pyramid, but it was firmly closed.&#xA0;</span><span>Crockta&#x2019;s companions exchanged glances and approached.&#xA0;</span><span>The snakes realized there were intruders and raised their heads. Their forked tongues hissed at Crockta&#x2019;s group.</span></p><p><span>Crockta pulled out God Slayer. The snakes&#x2019; heads reared back.&#xA0;</span><span>As Crockta pointed the big sword at them, the snakes couldn&#x2019;t get closer.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Smart guys.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>The serpents stared at them as they stood at the entrance.&#xA0;</span><span>Zankus grabbed the door handle and pulled.&#xA0;</span><span>It was firmly locked.</span></p><p><span>&quot;It won&apos;t open.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Tiyo and Anor also pulled once, but it didn&#x2019;t open. Zankus examined the door. It was built firmly and no gaps could be seen.&#xA0;</span><span>Crockta went forward.</span></p><p><span>&quot;I&#x2019;ll open it.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Tiyo shook his head.</span></p><p><span>&quot;It is a locked door. You can&#x2019;t open this...&#x201D;</span></p><p><i><span>Sururung!</span></i></p><p><span>Crockta moved his hand and the door opened with a grinding sound.&#xA0;</span><span>Everyone was surprised when it opened so easily.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;How...?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;No way.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Zankus nodded.</span></p><p><span>&quot;The door seems to have magic that judges people based on whether they are qualified or not.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Qualified?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;It might be a place for Crockta.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>They all looked at Crockta.&#xA0;</span><span>His companions always forgot, but Crockta was a fearsome warrior who won against the great chieftain in the north and defeated the empire&#x2019;s large army alone. He wasn&#x2019;t an ordinary orc.&#xA0;</span><span>The pyramid acknowledged Crockta.</span></p><p><span>Crockta coughed.</span></p><p><span>&quot;Hmm, let&#x2019;s enter.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>The admiration of the party continued.</span></p><p><span>&quot;Truly Crockta...my companion <em>dot</em>!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Amazing.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Kulkul, this child has become like this...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Crockta ignored them, moving forward while muttering,&#xA0;</span><span>&quot;If pulling doesn&#x2019;t work, push the door...&#x201D;</span></p><p></p><p style="text-align: center"><span>***</span></p><p></p><p><span>The pyramid was in the center of a humid swamp, but the interior was completely dry. It was rather dry.&#xA0;</span><span>What was this place?&#xA0;</span><span>The snakes had hovered around, as if they were guarding the pyramid. They had to be guarding something.</span></p><p><span>&quot;Do you still feel it?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Crockta asked Anor.&#xA0;</span><span>Anor nodded. He looked around the pyramid, as if he were trying to pick up that energy.&#xA0;</span><span>Crockta also felt the Demon&#x2019;s Mouth responding at his waist.&#xA0;</span><span>Something existed here that had to do with both necromancy and the Demon&#x2019;s Mouth.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;There doesn&#x2019;t seem to be anything dangerous.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Crockta placed God Slayer back on his back. &#xA0;</span><span>There were no snakes or insects inside the pyramid. The monsters guarding dungeons couldn&#x2019;t be seen. They kept moving forward.</span></p><p><span>Suddenly, Zankus said,&#xA0;</span><span>&#x201C;Strange.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;What are you saying <em>dot</em>?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;We&#x2019;ve been walking for a long time.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;That&#x2019;s right <em>dot</em>.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Was the pyramid that big?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;......!&quot;</span></p><p><span>They had walked in a straight line from the entrance.&#xA0;</span><span>The pyramid wasn&#x2019;t small, but they shouldn&#x2019;t have been walking so long.&#xA0;</span><span>However, they had already been walking for a long time.&#xA0;</span><span>Zankus placed the light he was holding on to the ground and measured something.</span></p><p><span>&quot;Is it going downhill?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Crockta asked?&#xA0;</span><span>As he said, the ground was at a slight slope that was leading underground. If so, it was possible for them to walk that long.</span></p><p><span>Zankus shook his head.&#xA0;</span><span>&#x201C;It doesn&#x2019;t seem like it.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Then...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Something is going on.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Crockta looked at the end of the passage. The Demon&#x2019;s Mouth at his waist kept pulling him.&#xA0;</span><span>There was something at the end of this path.</span></p><p><span>&quot;Keep going. What will be in here?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Go dot!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>They kept walking.&#xA0;</span><span>At the end of the passage, a large space appeared. The ceiling was high and something unknown was emitting a light.&#xA0;</span><span>However, the glow wasn&#x2019;t blinding.&#xA0;</span><span>The light source illuminated the inside of the space so that they could see clearly, but it was calm enough that they could open their eyes.</span></p><p><span>At that moment,&#xA0;</span><span>&#x201C;Who are you?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Crockta&#x2019;s group turned towards the voice.&#xA0;</span><span>A man was looking at them. The man was impeccably dressed and didn&#x2019;t seem to suit the pyramid.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;An orc and gnome. A dark elf...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>But Crockta could see it.&#xA0;</span><span>There was a tail coming from the back of the man&#x2019;s suit.&#xA0;</span><span>The tail resembled a scorpion&#x2019;s and the tip was sharp.</span></p><p><span>&quot;I will start the introductions. My name is Abaddon. You are uninvited guests, but I would like to welcome you to this place.&#x201D;</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p><p><a href="www.wuxiaworld.com">Glossary of Common Korean Terms.</a></p><p>Praise the Orc:&#xA0;<a href="docs.google.com">Glossary Link.&#xA0;</a></p><p>Current schedule:&#xA0;There will now be 14 chapters a week, meaning two chapters every day.</p><p>I have also updated my&#xA0;<a href="www.patreon.com">Patreon</a>&#xA0;to reflect my new novels.
