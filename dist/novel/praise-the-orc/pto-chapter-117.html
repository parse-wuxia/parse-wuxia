<p><span>Chapter 117 - First Strike (1)</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p><p><span>Crockta raised his body.</span></p><p><span>His whole body creaked and groaned, a cacophony of injuries that was hard to bear. Calmahart, who was the victim of his kinetic energy, should be a mess inside and outside the body.&#xA0;</span><span>He looked down at the great chieftain, who didn&#x2019;t move like he was a dead man.</span></p><p><span>Now that the dust settled down, all eyes in Juora were on him.&#xA0;</span><span>The orcs and dark elves, everyone was shocked by Crockta&#x2019;s appearance.</span></p><p><span>Crockta raised his greatsword before the orcs could recover.&#xA0;</span><span>The warriors finally realized the situation and moved their bodies, but Crockta&#x2019;s greatsword didn&#x2019;t stop.&#xA0;</span><span>Ogre Slayer descended towards the fallen Calmahart.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Waahh!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Great chieftain!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>The screams of the dark elves and the orcs mingled together.</span></p><p><span>And Crockta.&#xA0;</span><span>His face distorted.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Kuhuhuhu...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Truly a monster.&#xA0;</span><span>Calmahart had grabbed the greatsword with his bare hands.&#xA0;</span><span>Crockta gazed at him and smiled. The eyes of the great chieftain were clearer than ever.&#xA0;</span><span>Calmahart also smiled at Crockta. It was a horrible smile that didn&#x2019;t care about the blood flowing from his mouth.</span></p><p><span>He got up. Crockta tried to pull back the greatsword but it didn&#x2019;t move within the grasp.&#xA0;</span><span>Crockta kicked Calmahart&#x2019;s body. It felt like a rock. But it was useless.&#xA0;</span><span>The great chieftain slowly lifted his head.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;We meet again...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Calmahart stood up while still holding Ogre Slayer&#x2019;s blade.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Crockta.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>He remembered Crockta&#x2019;s name and then wielded Ogre Slayer.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Kuhahahahat!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Kuhuk!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Crockta persisted in holding the handle of Ogre Slayer.&#xA0;</span><span>As Crockta didn&#x2019;t let go even when it was shaken left and right, the great chieftain threw Crockta along with the greatsword.&#xA0;</span><span>His body was thrown back and he hit a wall.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Cough!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Crockta raised his body.&#xA0;</span><span>His head was ringing.&#xA0;</span><span>The moment he wanted to grab his forehead to recover from the shock...</span></p><p><span>A shadow entered his field of view.</span></p><p><span>&quot;......!&quot;</span></p><p><span>Crockta instinctively wielded the greatsword.&#xA0;</span><span>It was stuck in something heavy.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Ueeh...!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>It was a halberd that a great warrior had aimed at him.&#xA0;</span><span>Crockta swung the greatsword back around and beheaded him. Blood flowed onto the ground from the body of the dead warrior.</span></p><p><span>His opponent wasn&#x2019;t just Calmahart.&#xA0;</span><span>This was a war.&#xA0;</span><span>The Great Clan warriors slowly started approaching Crockta. Crockta raised his greatsword.</span></p><p><span>Then he laughed.&#xA0;</span><span>&quot;Yes, it should be like this.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Things were never easy.&#xA0;</span><span>He always performed the most difficult missions in the most dangerous place. It would be too easy if it was finished like this.</span></p><p><span>Crockta searched for any gaps as he was surrounded by the warriors.&#xA0;</span><span>He had to kill the weakest one and escape the disadvantageous formation. Grasp the weakest person, the weak point, and then bite.</span></p><p><span>It was war.</span></p><p><span>At that moment, he could hear, &quot;Don&#x2019;t forget us </span><i><span>dot</span></i><span>!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>There was a colorful bombardment of energy. Magic power bullets poured from the sky, causing the warriors to retreat.&#xA0;</span><span>It was Tiyo.&#xA0;</span><span>Tiyo&#x2019;s General had developed even further. General Vulcan rotated and fired bullets indiscriminately.</span></p><p><span>Boro kept turning around, making it easier for Tiyo to attack.&#xA0;</span><span>Then the dark elves recovered their minds and started fighting. Arrows flew.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;It has been a while.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>A familiar voice was also heard. Life was always unknown. He never expected that he would welcome this twisted voice.</span></p><p><span>&quot;Are you weak? You must be exhausted with that blow.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Driden.&#xA0;</span><span>He had recovered from the impact and was standing with his double swords. His face was a mess thanks to Calmahart, but he was gazing in front of him in a sharp manner.</span></p><p><span>Crockta laughed, &quot;You really look pitiful after just one blow.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;What, were you watching?&#x201D;&#xA0;</span><span>Driden also grinned. It was hard to see his smile.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;A monster.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Monster.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>They muttered at the same time as they gazed at the approaching Calmahart.</span></p><p><span>&quot;I will take care of the rest.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span><span>Driden said. His double swords started to flow like he was already in combat.&#xA0;</span><span>The moment someone entered that trajectory, it would become a storm.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;The great chieftain?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;You take care of it.&quot;</span></p><p><span>Crockta laughed out loud.&#xA0;</span><span>It was a pleasure to be recognized by a great fighter like Driden, but it was never pleasant to deal with that monster alone.&#xA0;</span><span>But it couldn&apos;t be helped.&#xA0;</span><span>Crockta raised his greatsword. He exchanged a glance with Driden. There was brief eye contact and they nodded. Then both of them rushed out at the same time.</span></p><p><span>The great chieftain was in front of him.&#xA0;</span><span>Crockta jumped up and roared, &quot;Bul&#x2019;tarrrr!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>He brandished his greatsword. The great chieftain also wielded his double edged axe. Both weapons hit each other. His hands shook from the crushing impact.&#xA0;</span><span>Crockta dug in and aimed for the great chieftain&#x2019;s lower body. The great chieftain stepped back and aimed at Crockta&#x2019;s head. The attacks of the two missed.&#xA0;</span><span>They hit air instead of each other.</span></p><p><span>Crockta accelerated his body. His field of view was clear.&#xA0;</span><span>His keen senses read the surroundings. Now his power was at the Pinnacle.&#xA0;</span><span>Crockta&#x2019;s movements encouraged the great chieftain. He also entered that realm.</span></p><p><span>This was no longer a fight, but a dance that was a mix of the sword and axe.&#xA0;</span><span>The axe aimed at the neck while the greatsword aimed at the abdomen. Just before they dealt the fatal blow, their bodies twisted once again.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>Their weapons stopped in the air. Their bodies met instead of retreating.&#xA0;</span><span>They punched and kicked each other.&#xA0;</span><span>Crockta was pushed back.&#xA0;</span><span>The great chieftain laughed and raised his axe again. Crockta spat out blood and lifted the greatsword. Ogre Slayer vibrated.</span></p><p><span>&quot;Join me, Crockta.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span><span>Calmahart laughed.&#xA0;</span><span>&quot;You are qualified to enter the Great Clan. I&#x2019;ll give you the position of a clan chief.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Clan chief.&#xA0;</span><span>There was no such position in the Great Clan. The leader of the clan was the great chieftain. Calmahart wanted Crockta so much that he even created a new position.</span></p><p><span>But...</span></p><p><span>He knew Crockta and knew that Crockta would refuse.&#xA0;</span><span>Crockta lifted Ogre Slayer instead of responding.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Kuahahahat! Good answer!&#x201D;&#xA0;</span><span>The great chieftain jumped forward while reaching out a hand. Crockta&#x2019;s greatsword responded by blocking the axe held in one hand.&#xA0;</span><span>It was an overwhelming confidence in his strength.</span></p><p><span>Crockta squeezed more strength into his muscles.&#xA0;</span><span>Just before Calmahart&#x2019;s other hand grabbed his head, Crockta&#x2019;s greatsword blew away the axe and became stuck in Calmahart&#x2019;s side. Calmahart&#x2019;s eyes widened.</span></p><p><span>&quot;Too prideful, Calmahart!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Crockta twisted the blade and made the wound wider. Calmahart groaned.&#xA0;</span><span>Crockta kicked him. Calmahart fell back. Calmahart grabbed the axe and defended against the new blow from the greatsword.</span></p><p><i><span>Kakang!</span></i></p><p><i><span>Kang!</span></i></p><p><i><span>Kakang!</span></i></p><p><span>Crockta attacked while Calmahart defended.&#xA0;</span><span>The great warriors watching the great chieftain couldn&#x2019;t believe their eyes. No warrior had pushed the great chieftain this far.&#xA0;</span><span>The previous attack was a raid. But now, even in the unfavorable situation surrounded by opponents, the orc from the continent was facing the great chieftain.</span></p><p><span>The great chieftain swung his axe but Crockta avoided it. Calmahart&#x2019;s abdomen was pierced again.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Kuhuhuhu...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Calmahart laughed.&#xA0;</span><span>But unlike his facial expression, an intense anger was boiling up inside him.&#xA0;</span><span>It was different from Driden&#x2019;s case. Crockta&#x2019;s blows were heavy compared to the double swords. The internal damage was huge.</span></p><p><span>This shouldn&#x2019;t be the case.&#xA0;</span><span>He was the great chieftain, Calmahart.&#xA0;</span><span>He always had to win overwhelmingly.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Kuaaaaaaaaaaaah!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>His eyes reddened again. The muscles swelled. A tremendous power rose.&#xA0;</span><span>This unprecedented power made him feel like he could tear apart the orc from the continent with his bare hands. The madness eroded his head.&#xA0;</span><span>He grasped the axe. His hands gripping the axe trembled.</span></p><p><span>The wounds instantly recovered.&#xA0;</span><span>Calmahart&#x2019;s red eyes stared at Crockta.</span></p><p><span>&quot;Look at the little tricks again. Kuhuhuhu.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Crockta&#x2019;s eyes changed.&#xA0;</span><span>Calmahart had once again fallen into a frenzied state. Something was shining on his forehead.&#xA0;</span><span>Now Crockta could see.&#xA0;</span><span>Calmahart borrowed the power of something in this world, just like how Zelkian was the apostle of the world tree. This was what made Calmahart a terrifying monster.</span></p><p><span>Crockta declared, &quot;How shameful, Calmahart.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;What do you mean?&quot;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Your strength isn&#x2019;t something that you obtained yourself.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Crockta stretched and placed his greatsword on his shoulder. He openly stared at Calmahart.</span></p><p><span>&quot;If it weren&#x2019;t for that power, you would be worse off than your own men. Isn&apos;t that right?&quot;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Nonsense!&#x201D;&#xA0;</span><span>Calmahart exploded, &quot;Stop the bullshit! Garbage&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>He wielded the double edged sword furiously. Crockta retreated but his front was still cut.&#xA0;</span><span>The berserk Calmahart had unbelievable power and speed. Despite the world slowing down, Calmahart&#x2019;s axe tore through that slow world.</span></p><p><span>Crockta blocked with his greatsword. However, the impact shook his whole body.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Trash from the continent&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Calmahart didn&#x2019;t miss this chance and came running at Crockta.&#xA0;</span><span>As soon as Crockta hit the wall, the double edged axe would mangle his body.</span></p><p><span>Crockta gritted his teeth.&#xA0;</span><span>He couldn&#x2019;t change directions in the air. The great chieftain was going to kill him.</span></p><p><span>At that moment.&#xA0;</span><span>He felt something flying from behind him.&#xA0;</span><span>His extremely keen senses recognized it without seeing it. It was General&#x2019;s bullets that were aiming for the great chieftain.</span></p><p><span>Tiyo&#x2019;s support.&#xA0;</span><span>However, that alone couldn&#x2019;t deter Calmahart. He wasn&#x2019;t an ordinary orc but a monster.&#xA0;</span><span>Crockta quickly calculated how to break through this crisis. The short moment where the great chieftain was holding his axe felt like eternity.</span></p><p><span>Maybe.&#xA0;</span><span>Crockta gritted his teeth.&#xA0;</span><span>One method came to mind. It was a scene drawn through his instinct, not his head.</span></p><p><span>Crockta threw his greatsword.&#xA0;</span><span>Ogre Slayer flew in the air, spinning round and round.&#xA0;</span><span>He couldn&#x2019;t put any strength into it because he couldn&#x2019;t pivot. The greatsword slowly moved towards the great chieftain, or it was more like the great chieftain was rushing towards the stopped sword.</span></p><p><span>And...</span></p><p><span>General&#x2019;s bullets hit Ogre Slayer.</span></p><p><span>&quot;......!&quot;</span></p><p><span>They hit the handle of Ogre Slayer.&#xA0;</span><span>The sudden shock caused Ogre Slayer to turn fiercely towards the great chieftain. It spun like a pinwheel towards the great chieftain.&#xA0;</span><span>Calmahart, who was about to swing the axe, couldn&#x2019;t avoid Ogre Slayer and clutched his face.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Kuaack!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Ogre Slayer raked across his face as it passed by.&#xA0;</span><span>Calmahart let go of the axe and grabbed his face.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Kuaaaaak!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Crockta finally hit the wall and slid to the ground. A huge shock wave. He felt nauseated.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Kuaaaaak!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Calmahart&#x2019;s mad shout resonated through the area.&#xA0;</span><span>Crockta hurriedly got up. Ogre Slayer was at Calmahart&#x2019;s feet.&#xA0;</span><span>The bloody face of the great chieftain stared at him. Crockta forcibly smiled.</span></p><p><span>Calmahart&#x2019;s huge body was approaching him. Calmahart&#x2019;s bloody face made him look like a demon.&#xA0;</span><span>It was an urgent situation.</span></p><p><span>Crockta quickly said, &quot;Look at that expression.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Then Calmahart&#x2019;s face distorted further as he lifted his double edged axe high into the air, its grim shadow covering Crockta&#x2019;s head.</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p><p><a href="www.wuxiaworld.com">Glossary of Common Korean Terms.</a></p><p>Praise the Orc:&#xA0;<a href="docs.google.com">Glossary Link.&#xA0;</a></p><p>Current schedule:&#xA0;<strong>Next Patreon goal has been reached!!
