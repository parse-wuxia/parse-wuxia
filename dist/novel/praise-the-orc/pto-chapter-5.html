<p><span>Chapter 5 - Instructor Lenox (2)</span></p><p><br></p><hr><p><br></p><p><span>Tips for surviving on the battlefield.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>First:</span></p><p><span>All skills must be engraved into the subconscious and used according to one&#x2019;s instincts.</span></p><p><span>It would be too late if one thought through an action in their head. A decision can&#x2019;t be made in that short moment, so one&#x2019;s actions should be automatic. Only training and constant practice can make this possible.</span></p><p><span>Some lazy recruits just trained until they fell over in exhaustion.&#xA0;</span><span>It was in order to survive.&#xA0;</span><span>Of course, most of those recruits were killed or wounded in the first battle. After falling, they realized the sweat was actually blood and felt regret.</span></p><p><span>Ian was well aware of this, so he never put down the greatsword.</span></p><p><span>&quot;Newbie, how do you feel?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Is he the apprentice? Kulkulkul.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Ian didn&#x2019;t rest even when the sun set.&#xA0;</span><span>If other users saw it, then they would just consider it repeating the same action; however, for Ian, this was real life training.</span></p><p><span>He was a warrior. He would soon meet monsters and swing the sword at the enemy. He knew there was no luck on the battlefield, just his own skills and abilities.&#xA0;</span><span>He stretched his body. He wanted to fall down. However, he kept on wielding his greatsword.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Uraaaaaah!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>A clean cut.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Huaaaaat!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Ian repeated his actions of cutting and stabbing.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Are you still continuing?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Welcome!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>After a while, Lenox came up to him. Ian jumped up and took an alert posture, causing Lenox to shake his head.</span></p><p><span>&quot;There is no need for that.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Yes!&quot;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Try it again.&quot;</span></p><p><span>Ian breathed in and grasped the greatsword again. All of the muscles in his body screamed.&#xA0;</span><span>His waist was bowed.</span></p><p><span>&quot;Waist up!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Lenox shouted. Ian fixed his posture and wielded the greatsword.</span></p><p><span>&quot;Don&#x2019;t drop your head! Look ahead! Look at the enemy!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Uwaaaaah!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;The enemy won&#x2019;t care for your circumstances! It is hard! So what? Nobody cares! Get rid of your weaknesses!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Uraaaaat!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;It is hard! Don&#x2019;t relax! Swing the sword! Bigger!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Yiaaaaaaack!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Repeat it! Continue! Until you forget how to breathe!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Ian repeated his actions.&#xA0;</span><span>Under Lenox&#x2019;s teaching, he polished the basics of swordsmanship he learned from Baek Hanho, such as stabbing and slashing.&#xA0;</span><span>Lenox further enhanced this.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Continue! Squeeze! Of course it will be difficult!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Huaat!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;If it weren&#x2019;t so hard, then everyone would be a warrior!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Uraaaaaah!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Not everyone can be a warrior!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Lenox and Ian yelled passionately.&#xA0;</span><span>This passion was passed onto the other orc warriors.</span></p><p><span>&quot;You there! Are you going to fall down when that newbie over there hasn&#x2019;t?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;No!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;I think not! No! Then why are you still down there!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;I will stand up!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;If you are going to fall, then crawl out of the training grounds!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;I won&#x2019;t!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;You can enjoy the rest of your life! Now swing it!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Bul&#x2019;tarrrr!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>The orcs started to wield their weapons while shouting.&#xA0;</span><span>Those who collapsed during the sparring got back up and rushed at each other.</span></p><p><span>Lenox&#x2019;s yells and the orc warriors&#x2019; cries rang out through Orcrox Fortress. Those who passed by the training grounds turned their heads with surprise.</span></p><p><span>Ian forcibly raised his body after he fell.</span></p><p><span>A smile emerged on his face. He hadn&#x2019;t felt this feeling in a long time</span><span>&#x2014;</span><span>the pain caused by fighting to the limits</span><span>&#x2014;t</span><span>hat feeling when the pain was transformed into pleasure, and sharing this feeling with his colleagues!</span></p><p><span>[Amazing! The orc warriors have recognized the fighting spirit of the orc apprentice warrior.]</span></p><p><span>[The strength to fight without giving up, the indomitable spirit is the best virtue for orc warriors.]</span></p><p><span>[Warrior&#x2019;s Spirit (Common) has been acquired.]</span></p><p><span>[Your willpower is more than just mere fighting spirit. Warrior&apos;s Spirit (Common) has been upgraded to Warrior&#x2019;s Fighting Spirit (Uncommon)!]</span></p><p><span><span><a href="#footnote-30" id="footnoteref-30"></a></span></span></p><p>[One <span id="footnote-10">achievement point has been acquired!]</span></p><p><span>[Your level has risen.]</span></p><p><span>The message windows popped up but Ian shook his head and didn&#x2019;t even read them. This moment was more important than that.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Newbie! What is your name?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;I am Ian!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Become a warrior! Then you will receive a new name!&#x201D; Lenox shouted.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>The ugly visage of the orc seemed to be smiling.</span></p><p><span>&quot;So I won&#x2019;t remember your name!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Yes!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Become a warrior!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;I will!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Swing it properly!&quot;</span></p><p><span>[The proficiency of the skill Greatsword Technique (Common) has risen.]</span></p><p><span>[If you continue building up proficiency, you can upgrade Greatsword Technique (Common) to the Uncommon rank.]</span></p><p><span>Ian wielded his greatsword like crazy.&#xA0;</span><span>If this was reality, then it would be harsh training. However, it was a game, and he felt like he was gaining the nature of the orc species. His limits were constantly being renewed and developing.</span></p><p><span>There was no gain without suffering.</span></p><p><span>He understood why people avoided orcs. They were a truly hardcore species.</span></p><p><span>In the distance, he saw someone&#x2019;s wrist being cut off in a spar. They paused for a moment before sprinkling a potion on the stump and reattaching their arms. Then they once again picked up the halberd.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;I&apos;m alive! Bul&#x2019;tarrrr!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>The spar resumed.</span></p><p><span>Ian couldn&#x2019;t help but laugh.&#xA0;</span><span>The training of real men that was hard to believe!</span></p><p><span>Once Grom returned to the training camp, he discovered orcs collapsed on the ground.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;...What is going on?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Grom asked Ian who was lying on the ground.</span></p><p><span>&quot;Grom is right.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;What?&quot;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Orc, it is hard.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Ian chuckled slightly. As the ugly orc&#x2019;s face twisted, Grom nodded shakily.</span></p><p><br></p><p style="text-align: center"><span>***</span></p><p><br></p><p><span>&quot;Oppa, did you start the game?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Yiyu asked him.&#xA0;</span><span>Her brother Ian was stretching his shoulders like they were stiff.</span></p><p><span>&quot;Yes.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;What? More information! Where?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;It is a secret.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Ah, why is it a secret?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;It is only for my heart.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Okay, I don&#x2019;t need to know right now. A noob, noob. You are just a complete novice.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Ian laughed,</span></p><p><span>&quot;Then what level are you?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Me? I...um...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Her voice trailed off before she blurted out,</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;I am a pretty and cute elf mystic.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;I asked for your level, not your species and profession...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;A wonderful elf mystic.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;......&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;So you know.&quot;</span></p><p><span>Yiyu raised a finger to her mouth like she wouldn&#x2019;t answer any more questions.&#xA0;</span><span>Then a voice interrupted them.</span></p><p><span>&quot;Boss-nim. It is done. Here.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Thank you. Now, your sweet potato latte.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Ian&#x2019;s shop, Cafe Reason, had a student working part time. Her name was Yeori, and she was charming with a pretty appearance.&#xA0;</span><span>It was the reason why Yiyu took the cup with narrowed eyes.</span></p><p><span>&quot;Hrmm...&quot;</span></p><p><span>&quot;You should go to school.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;There is still plenty of time.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;I don&#x2019;t have time.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Ian gestured with his chin.&#xA0;</span><span>Yiyu looked back and saw that a group of female university students were entering the cafe. She looked at Ian and whispered,</span></p><p><span>&quot;Hrmm...&quot;</span></p><p><span>Yiyu&#x2019;s eyes narrowed again.</span></p><p><span>&quot;Boss-nim. Should I get the order? Do you want to take a break with your sister?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;No, it&#x2019;s okay.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Yes.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Yiyu pulled out a 500 won coin and put it on the counter.</span></p><p><span>&quot;Calculate it.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;500 won is just for standing in the line...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;You sell a lot,&#x201D; Yiyu said before leaving the cafe.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>Ian looked at her back and laughed.</span></p><p><span>The group of female students approached.&#xA0;</span><span>Ian stood at the counter. In the meantime, they were talking among themselves.</span></p><p><span>&quot;I was lucky to meet a party yesterday in Elder Lord. The party leader was a high level person. His female companion was also a high level, but they were lacking people.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;How good.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;It was the first time I actually saw a high level. They were also hunting orcs.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Wow, orcs?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;The orcs charged with axes and bloodthirsty eyes. However, the party leader cut the orcs, leaving only the remains behind. It was completely amazing, I was enlightened yesterday.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;I&#x2019;m envious. When will I be able to do something like that? They aren&#x2019;t rankers?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;This is a chance, a chance.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Ian&apos;s eyebrows twitched.</span></p><p><span>&quot;Uh, Boss-nim! Hello! We came again.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Boss-nim, our exams are over.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Two of the females talked to Ian in a friendly manner,</span></p><p><span>&quot;...Yes.&quot;</span></p><p><span>&quot;We&#x2019;ll have a warm Americano, cappuccino...ah, two cappuccinos. And...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Ian nodded.</span></p><p><span>&quot;Yes.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;...Boss-nim, is something wrong?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Ian was famous as a warm-hearted cafe boss who always smiled gently, but a cold wind was blowing today.</span></p><p><span>&quot;No.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Uhh...&quot;</span></p><p><span>&quot;I&#x2019;ll let you know when it is ready with the bell.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Yes...&quot;</span></p><p><span>Ian muttered as they turned around,</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Bul&#x2019;tar...!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Ian tilted his head.</span></p><p><span>After the drinks were served to the customers, Ian opened his phone. He needed to become as strong as possible to defend his sister.&#xA0;</span><span>However, he couldn&#x2019;t find any tips on playing as an orc. Rather, there was only talk about how they quit being an orc.</span></p><p><span>[Author: From Orc to Elf</span></p><p><span>Title: I quit being an orc.</span></p><p><span>I tried it because I thought that other people just didn&#x2019;t play it well.</span></p><p><span>The conclusion is: never play as one.</span></p><p><span>Aren&#x2019;t things like production, administrative work, and farmer available for females with weak hearts or those who don&#x2019;t like combat? They can work under NPCs. This is why it is said that Elder Lord has implemented a true fantasy life.</span></p><p><span>However, there is no such thing for orcs. You can only be a warrior or a shaman, almost unconditionally.</span></p><p><span>In addition, users pounce when they see orcs... The funny thing is that the high level users of other races and the orc beginners areas overlap. Aren&#x2019;t high level users killing orcs to gain levels and get items? NPCs are okay, since they can fight the high level users. But users?</span></p><p><span>We are treated as mobs from the start.&#xA0;</span><span>If the NPCs can barely manage to win...we can&#x2019;t handle them. Although it is realistic for people to die, it is too much when they treat us orcs as mobs instead of people.</span></p><p><span>I&#x2019;m exhausted.</span></p><p><span>The conclusion is that orcs can be raised as a character in other games, but Elder Lord is different. It is hard, there are no users, and it isn&#x2019;t fun.</span></p><p><span>Choose a human or an elf, and then your eyes can look at something better. Isn&#x2019;t love also possible? Why else is Elder Lord 19+? Huhuhuhu.]</span></p><p><span>&#x2514; Experienced an Orc: &#x3139;&#x3147;They are a trash species</span></p><p><span>&#x2514; I am a Legend: In the first place, they were just a mob that was mistakenly opened up as a species. The system is too complicated, so the game makers couldn&#x2019;t fix it.</span></p><p><span>&#x2514; Jarapapa: Orcs are a mob ^^ They&#x2019;re honey for the high level users. They give decent achievement points.</span></p><p><span>Ian confirmed the content and comments.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;These bastards...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>He had felt the passion of Lenox and the orc warriors, so calling them mobs was just nonsense.&#xA0;</span><span>At that moment, another orc related post appeared.&#xA0;</span><span>The title, &#x2018;I am an Orc.&#x2019;made Ian click it right away.</span></p><p><span>[Author: Anonymous Orc.</span></p><p><span>Title: I am an Orc.</span></p><p><span>I am an orc. From the start, I wanted to be an orc warrior or orc shaman.</span></p><p><span>Actually, I was a human, but then I encountered a NPC and reset. I was a high level user. I was dirty and dishonorable.</span></p><p><span>An orc is much better than a lousy human. It is hard, but...being an orc is much better than being a human. They have an ignorant side, but they never stab anyone in the back.</span></p><p><span>Well, I&#x2019;m not going to be a ranker, but I can get rid of my everyday stress. Just think about it if you are considering starting.</span></p><p><span>Actually, I am an orc, but this isn&#x2019;t something that ordinary people can do. It is hard. It isn&#x2019;t a game, but hard work. Training is a basic part of the action. But whether it is fighting or working hard, their fighting spirits explode.</span></p><p><span>Only a true man can challenge it.</span></p><p><span>I hope that someday, users will come to see the orc area. You will see an orc player carrying twin axes. Let&#x2019;s share a greeting if we ever meet (bump fists).</span></p><p><span>Of course, if you are a human, then you will die.]</span></p><p><span>&#x2514; Our Local Human Leader: This cocky mob shouldn&#x2019;t mess with me.</span></p><p><span>&#x2514; Peanuts are Amazing: It is great &#x314E;&#x3137;&#x3137;. Masculinity &#x3147;&#x3148;&#x3147;&#x3148;. Of course, if humans or elves use the same amount of effort &#x314B;&#x314B;&#x314B;. What a vain effort.</span></p><p><span>&#x2514; Anonymous Orc (Author): You are truly dirty humans.</span></p><p><span>&#x2514; Don&#x2019;t be an Orc: I saw your post and tried being an orc ;;; I quit.</span></p><p><span>Ian nodded. That man was an orc.</span></p><p><span>However, he couldn&#x2019;t find any knowledge on orcs. There were no tips and it could be called a species filled with NPCs.</span></p><p><span>When Ian looked at other species, he found all types of tricks, scams, and introductions to NPCs.</span></p><p><span>Some NPCs couldn&#x2019;t be tricked, due to their high artificial intelligence, and some discriminated against those who were &#x2018;cursed by the stars.&#x2019;&#xA0;</span><span>As a result, a keyboard battle often occurred on the forums. The discrimination against users by NPCs despite it being a game caused chaos. There were many philosophical debates on morality and ethics.</span></p><p><span>There were even situations where users were deceived and cheated.</span></p><p><span>Ian shook his head.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Humans are dirty too...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>One of the female students watching him shook her head.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Boss-nim is weird today...&#x201D;</span></p><p><br></p><hr><p><br></p><p>I have a <a href="www.wuxiaworld.com">Glossary of Common Korean Terms</a> for any unfamiliar honourifics or other Korean elements that you might be unfamiliar with.</p><p>My editor Superposhposh also created a glossary to keep track of everything. Currently it is up to chapter 5 so be careful of spoilers. <a href="docs.google.com">Glossary Link.&#xA0;</a></p><p>Current schedule: 2 chapters a day.</p><p>I have also updated my <a href="www.patreon.com">Patreon</a> to reflect my new novels.
