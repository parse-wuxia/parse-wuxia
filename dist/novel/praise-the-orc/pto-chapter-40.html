<p><span>Chapter 40 - Chesswood (1)</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p><p><span>&#x201C;What will you do?&#x201D; asked Jeremy, Derek&#x2019;s subordinate.</span></p><p><span>Derek had invested in Ilya betting on Elsanad&#x2019;s downfall, but the results had turned in an unexpected direction.&#xA0;</span><span>Crockta had accused both Ilya and Elsanad.</span></p><p><span>&quot;Wait a minute.&quot;</span></p><p><span>Derek was writing at his desk in his office. Jeremy waited. Derek wrote something for a while before putting down his pen.</span></p><p><span>&quot;I wish you luck... Let&#x2019;s pray that the Ashira flowers will bloom soon... Which one is okay?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Jeremy&#x2019;s eyes widened.&#xA0;</span><span>It was because there was a smile in Derek&#x2019;s voice.</span></p><p><span>&quot;I think both are good.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;If you think it is bad, then you can tell me.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Jeremy nodded and asked Derek a question.&#xA0;</span><span>&quot;Is the person a man or a woman?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;A man.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Then the former would be better.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;But he is an elf.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Then I will recommend the latter.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;You are very prejudiced about gender and species.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Derek laughed and picked up his pen again. &#xA0;</span><span>The sentence about the flowers blooming was derived from an epic poem. The Ashira flowers decorating a garland meant a march of victory.&#xA0;</span><span>It was meant to express good luck, but in a less dry manner.</span></p><p><span>&quot;Do you know how long it has been since I had to write a letter to fix an unexpected problem?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;I&#x2019;ve never seen it happen.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Yes. It was so long ago that I don&#x2019;t even remember it.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Derek placed the letter in an envelope and sealed it with candle wax and handed it to Jeremy.&#xA0;</span><span>&#x201C;Very interesting.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Is this as you expected?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Jeremy, victory is only worth it if you meet a difficult and unexpected problem, and manage to jump over it.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Jeremy was told to deliver a letter.&#xA0;</span><span>The recipient was a name that he didn&#x2019;t know.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Who is it?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Who? My new puppet.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Derek laughed.&#xA0;</span><span>&quot;Our orc warrior has upset Arnin, so now I need someone to fix it.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Then...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;The bad guys have been cleansed. However, new villains always appear in the world.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Jeremy nodded.&#xA0;</span><span>This was why he followed Derek. Jeremy had never seen any gaps in Derek. He responded as if everything was as expected, and produced results according to his own will.</span></p><p><span>It was also true for his incident. Crockta did things in a way that they hadn&#x2019;t expected. Ilya, whom they had invested in, was now a criminal and would be held in Arnin&#x2019;s dungeon.&#xA0;</span><span>Derek had said that this was unexpected, but Jeremy didn&#x2019;t think so. Derek had plenty of precautions for just in case.</span></p><p><span>In the larger picture, Derek still controlled everything according to his will.</span></p><p><span>&quot;Also, pass on the following information to Crockta.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Even though he broke the contract?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;In a way, I was in the wrong.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Crockta had placed a condition in the contract. He wouldn&#x2019;t do anything that would go against a warrior&#x2019;s honor.</span></p><p><span>&quot;I didn&#x2019;t know that Ilya and Elsanad were such villains, so I suppose it was to be expected that Crockta would be so willful.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;I understand.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Please. This time, I hope that you will help Crockta a bit.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Jeremy read the letter recipient&#x2019;s name again and nodded.&#xA0;</span><span>The recipient was the Arnin Plains administrator, Enyanis.</span></p><p><span>Now that Ilya and Elsanad had fallen, Arnin would need a new mayor. It didn&#x2019;t matter who they were. As long as he accepted Derek&#x2019;s help, he would become the new mayor of Arnin. The citizens would be enthusiastic about him without knowing his deceit. This was the world that Jeremy saw.</span></p><p></p><p style="text-align: center"><span>***</span></p><p></p><p><span>The two politicians turned out to be criminals.&#xA0;</span><span>There was a city wide outrage. They desired a new beginning. As there was a lot of excitement for a fresh start, new politicians appeared in Arnin and spoke about clearing up the ugly past.</span></p><p><span>The name of the honorary citizen Crockta also filled the city.&#xA0;</span><span>However, the orc didn&#x2019;t want the attention and didn&#x2019;t appear in front of the people. There was a huge response for Enyanis, the elf who appointed him as the honorary citizen.</span></p><p><span>A statue of the honorary citizen was erected in Arnin Square.&#xA0;</span><span>It was of an orc, not an elf, nor a human.</span></p><p><span>They didn&#x2019;t write his name in respect for his will, but all of the citizens of Arnin knew who the honorary citizen was. It was an expression of the citizen&#x2019;s wish for an &#x2018;honorary citizen&#x2019; to appear again whenever Arnin was corrupted.</span></p><p><span>&quot;I&apos;m tired.&quot;</span></p><p><span>Crockta hid his body because of his popularity. A hood covered his face, but it couldn&#x2019;t hide the orc&#x2019;s unique size, so he refrained from going out as much as possible.</span></p><p><span>&quot;It is because you are the only orc in Arnin,&#x201D; Enyanis said.</span></p><p><span>&quot;Are you really leaving?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;I have something to do.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Too bad. It would be nice if you could&#x2019;ve stayed longer.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Derek had unexpectedly given Crockta information about the next destination. Crockta became aware of another Thawing Balhae base.&#xA0;</span><span>The name of the destination was Chesswood.</span></p><p><span>This time, Derek didn&#x2019;t ask for anything. Derek&#x2019;s messenger said that Crockta could do what he wanted.&#xA0;</span><span>It was hard for Crockta to guess Derek&#x2019;s intentions, but he chose not to think too deeply. He would do what he needed to do.</span></p><p><span>&quot;This was the first place I saw you.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Crockta and Enyanis were standing on the Arnin Plains where they first met.&#xA0;</span><span>Enyanis nodded. He looked at the rock that Crockta left behind. &#x2018;A warrior doesn&#x2019;t attack unarmed people.&#x2019; The thrill Enyanis felt at that time was still vivid in his mind.</span></p><p><span>The orc in front of him was the type of person that he had never met before.&#xA0;</span><span>Many people spoke about justice with their mouths, but it was the first time he saw someone act directly on their words.&#xA0;</span><span>He was looking forward to the orc&#x2019;s actions in the future.</span></p><p><span>&quot;Where are you going?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Chesswood.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Chesswood...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>It is the land of humans.</span></p><p><span>And the word that best suited it was &#x2018;pandemonium.&#x2019; A cursed place.&#xA0;</span><span>But if it was this orc, it might turn out well.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Good luck. I hope that every step you take is filled with Ashira flowers.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Thank you.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Crockta didn&#x2019;t know what it implied, but it sounded good.&#xA0;</span><span>Suddenly, a yell was heard from those hunting the triters on the plains.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Wahh! Help me!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>A man was running away from a triter, but Crockta wasn&#x2019;t the one who moved.&#xA0;</span><span>Suddenly, dozens of arrows flew through the air and pierced the triter.&#xA0;</span><span>It was the skill of the user Yurin, who had joined the Arnin Plain&#x2019;s Rescue Unit after Crockta. She winked as she noticed Crockta&#x2019;s gaze. Crockta nodded.</span></p><p><span>In addition to Yurin, other NPCs and users were wearing the red rescue vest that symbolized the Arnin Plains&#x2019; Rescue Unit.&#xA0;</span><span>Those who didn&#x2019;t have the ability relied on the rescue unit to help them out with the triters. The Arnin Plains were filled with a lot of warmth.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;This is your heritage.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>The number of people who died hunting the triters greatly decreased. Crockta had made a contribution as the honorary citizen, alleviating the criticism towards other species.</span></p><p><span>&quot;Well, let&#x2019;s live and see each other again.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>It was time to leave.&#xA0;</span><span>Crockta extended his fist in the orc manner.&#xA0;</span><span>Enyanis also extended his fist. The orc greeting was strange, but he could feel something. Something seemed to rise in him as his fist met the orc&#x2019;s hard skin.</span></p><p><span>The two people firmly bumped fists.</span></p><p><span>Crockta turned around.&#xA0;</span><span>The large orc moved away from Arnin. It was calm after the great orc left.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Phew.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Somebody approached Enyanis, who had been staring blankly.&#xA0;</span><span>It was Jeremy, who had been sent by Derek. Jeremy whistled as he stood beside Enyanis.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Phew. That orc is truly frightening.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Enyanis stared at him. Jeremy turned around.&#xA0;</span><span>Both of them had already talked to each other.&#xA0;</span><span>Jeremy asked, &quot;Anyway, have you made up your mind?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;You will definitely keep the promise?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Of course. We&apos;ll help you.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;I didn&#x2019;t know a mere money lender would have so much money.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Watch your mouth. Derek is more than that.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Enyanis nodded.&#xA0;</span><span>&#x201C;Okay.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;It&apos;s a deal.&quot;</span></p><p><span>&quot;But keep this in mind. I might receive political funds from you, but I won&#x2019;t do anything unjust.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;We&#x2019;ll soon see.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Jeremy grinned. Everyone was like that at first.&#xA0;</span><span>&quot;Then other people will come and talk to you about the rest. I have to go.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Are you going with Crockta?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;He doesn&#x2019;t need to know.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Jeremy looked in the direction that Crockta went.&#xA0;</span><span>Derek said it was fine, but Jeremy was unsure. He would keep a close eye on the orc.</span></p><p></p><p style="text-align: center"><span>***</span></p><p></p><p><span>Ian disconnected.</span></p><p><span>He checked his watch and saw that he had been playing for a long time. The strange thing was that he didn&#x2019;t feel dizzy or tired at all. His body was refreshed, like he had a good night&#x2019;s sleep.</span></p><p><span>He looked back on the previous game play.&#xA0;</span><span>He was immersed, like he really was Crockta. The things that happened in the place called Arnin truly made him furious.</span></p><p><span>Thanks to Arnin, his achievement points had gone up tremendously. Despite accusing a high ranking NPC like the mayor, he seemed to have been praised for his influence in the world of Elder Lord. As his achievement points rose, his level also increased.</span></p><p><span>Now there weren&#x2019;t a lot of people playing Elder Lord who could ignore him.</span></p><p><span>He went out to the living room and turned on the TV. [Elder Lord News] was playing, a program that briefly told news about the world of Elder Lord.&#xA0;</span><span>There was also news about Arnin&#x2019;s mayor replacement. The details weren&#x2019;t revealed, but it mentioned that Arnin&#x2019;s mayor and mayor candidate were arrested after the accusation of a citizen.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Umm...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>He checked his phone and saw that it was the busy time at the caf&#xE9;.&#xA0;</span><span>He had left Han Yeori in charge. An image of her looking at him resentfully appeared in his head.&#xA0;</span><span>He needed to pay a bit of attention to her.</span></p><p><span>Ian left his house and drove to the caf&#xE9;.&#xA0;</span>After parking the car and entering the caf&#xE9;, he heard the greeting of the new part-timer, Yoo Sooyeon.</p><p><span>&quot;Welcome! This is Caf&#xE9; Reason.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>It was a cheerful voice that brightened up the listener&#x2019;s mood. Ian nodded. Han Yeori had taught her well.&#xA0;</span><span>Han Yeori confirmed Ian&#x2019;s appearance and said, &#x201C;It&#x2019;s the boss.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;......!&quot;</span></p><p><span>There was something strange.&#xA0;</span><span>Yoo Sooyeon&#x2019;s expression sank as she heard Han Yeori&#x2019;s words. It felt like she had lost all sense of animation. It was a subtle distinction, but Ian could clearly feel it.&#xA0;</span><span>Han Yeori looked at Ian and nodded towards a corner.</span></p><p><span>Ian turned towards where she was indicating.</span></p><p><span>&quot;......!&quot;</span></p><p><span>Ian was surprised again.&#xA0;</span><span>A familiar woman was elegantly sitting down with her legs crossed while also drinking a cup of coffee.</span></p><p><span>She was Ji Hayeon, the heir to the Myeongsong Group. She had already seen Ian and was smiling at him.&#xA0;</span><span>The men in suits that Ian had seen outside the caf&#xE9; were because of her.</span></p><p><span>Ian approached. Ji Hayeon spoke first.&#xA0;</span><span>&quot;Have you been busy these days?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;I think Hayeon-ssi is busier than me.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;That&apos;s right. I&#x2019;m busy, but I made some time.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>She took a sip of coffee. It was like a scene from a movie.</span></p><p><span>&quot;Ian-ssi, do you want some coffee? Or are you tired of it, after owning a caf&#xE9;?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Not really.&quot;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Have you eaten?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>There were a lot of questions. Ian smiled and shook his head.&#xA0;</span><span>&#x201C;No.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Then do you want to go and have dinner together? I&apos;ll buy it for you.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Ian shook his head again. Ji Hayeon&#x2019;s expression became sulky.&#xA0;</span><span>&#x201C;I&#x2019;m sorry, I&#x2019;m going to eat dinner with someone else later.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Who?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>He looked at Han Yeori instead of answering. She was making a drink for a customer.&#xA0;</span><span>She seemed listless, so he was going to buy her delicious food.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Is it like that between you two?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;It&#x2019;s just a boss and employee relationship.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Hrm...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>She looked at Ian like she was suspicious. Ian just shrugged.&#xA0;</span><span>The conversation between the two broke off. Ji Hayeon seemed to be thinking about something as she hesitated before opening her mouth.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Do you play Elder Lord?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Ian looked at her.</span></p><p><span>Recently, he discovered that Elder Saga Corporation was an affiliate of the Myeongsong Group.&#xA0;</span><span>Therefore, he didn&#x2019;t feel like her question was strange.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Yes.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;I see.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;What about Hayeon-ssi?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;I don&#x2019;t. Um...maybe Ian-ssi shouldn&#x2019;t play it either.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>She could be called a shareholder of Elder Lord. Ian cocked his head.&#xA0;</span><span>&quot;Is there a problem?&quot;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Nothing, just...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Her voice trailed off.</span></p><p><span>Ji Hayeon&#x2019;s father, Ji Eunchul, didn&#x2019;t allow his family to play Elder Lord.</span></p><p><span>It was due to safety.&#xA0;</span><span>It was a secret that Elder Lord&#x2019;s core system wasn&#x2019;t properly controlled. Even though the user protection system on the capsules guaranteed the safety of the users, Ji Eunchul had strictly forbidden any shareholders from playing it.</span></p><p><span>It was a matter that involved the reputation of the Myeongsong Group, so the company was using every means possible to find Yoo Jaehan, the only man who could solve it.&#xA0;</span><span>However, he was nowhere to be found.</span></p><p><span>Ji Hayeon couldn&#x2019;t explain that to Ian, so she laughed it off as a joke.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Don&#x2019;t people turn violent after playing games? Huhu.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>She glanced somewhere else. One of her bodyguards outside the caf&#xE9; was pointing to his watch. It was almost time for her next appointment.&#xA0;</span><span>She wanted to cancel it for dinner with Ian, but it seemed like today wouldn&#x2019;t work. She sighed.&#xA0;</span><span>&quot;I was rejected today. Do you dislike me?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;That&apos;s impossible.&quot;</span></p><p><span>Ian laughed. &quot;I&#x2019;ll have dinner with you next time.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Okay, it&#x2019;s a promise. How about the day after tomorrow?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Okay.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;It&#x2019;s a promise.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Ji Hayeon rose from his seat.&#xA0;</span><span>&quot;Then, I&#x2019;ll see you the day after tomorrow.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Yes.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>She left the caf&#xE9; with her unique and elegant gestures.</span></p><p><span>Ian headed to the counter after seeing her off. Yoo Sooyeon greeted Ian. She had been helped by Ian, and had become noticeably brighter ever since she started the part-time job.&#xA0;</span><span>Han Yeori glanced at Ian.</span></p><p><span>&quot;Boss-nim, what do you want? An expresso?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>It was a sullen voice. Ian laughed.&#xA0;</span><span>&quot;Yeori.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Yes.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Let&#x2019;s close up early today, and come have a good meal with me.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Omo, really?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Her expression changed in an instant. </span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Yes.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Ah, didn&#x2019;t you have an appointment with her?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;No.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Can I eat something expensive?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Yes.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Han Yeori nodded.&#xA0;</span><span>The caf&#xE9;&#x2019;s automatic door opened and some &#xA0;customers entered. Han Yeori greeted them quickly.</span></p><p><span>&quot;Welcome. This is Caf&#xE9; Reason.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>She once again returned to her normal animated self. Ian started laughing.</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p><p>Reminder, I will be having a monthly Q&amp;A on the Wuxiaworld Discord Channel.
