<p><span>Chapter 94 - Nameragon (3)</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p><p><span>The pair of swords filled Crockta&#x2019;s vision as they flowed through the air like a meteor shower. As Crockta twisted his body to avoid the trajectory of one sword, the other aimed for his neck.&#xA0;</span><span>The greatsword thwarted the attack.&#xA0;</span><span>The dark elf&#x2019;s scimitars were blocked by Ogre Slayer. The sound of metal clashing rang out.&#xA0;</span><span>It was an acrobatic type of defense.</span></p><p><span>The emotionless dark elf narrowed his eyes.</span></p><p><span>The world became increasingly slow.&#xA0;</span><span>In it, Crockta and the dark elf attacked each other at their own pace.&#xA0;</span><span>It was the world of the Pinnacle.</span></p><p><span>&quot;Dammit.&quot;</span></p><p><span>Crockta stepped back. It was too quick for the spectators to figure out what had happened.&#xA0;</span><span>However, Tiyo realized the level of both of them and gripped General more tightly.</span></p><p><span>&quot;Crockta. He is decent </span><i><span>dot</span></i><span>.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;No.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Crockta grinned as he said, &#x201C;He is strong.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Since his growth with Gushantimur, he was confident that no one around him would be able to deal with his strength. At least, he believed that he wouldn&#x2019;t struggle until he met the great chieftain.</span></p><p><span>But he met such an opponent as soon as he reached Nameragon.&#xA0;</span><span>What was happening?</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;What is your name?&#x201D; asked Crockta.</span></p><p><span>He greeted the dual wielding swordsman first.&#xA0;</span><span>The dark elf with the double swords didn&#x2019;t answer. The two blades just moved closer to his tense body.</span></p><p><span>Instead, the dark elf standing behind him replied, &#x201C;His name is Driden, a sword genius that won&#x2019;t be born again.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span><span>He laughed on his own.&#xA0;</span><span>&quot;Driden only listens to my commands. And as for my name, I am Aden, who will liberate Nameragon and open up a new north...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Crockta no longer listened. He only cared about the name Driden.</span></p><p><span>Driden.&#xA0;</span><span>He was a man worth remembering.</span></p><p><span>Driden&#x2019;s purple eyes seemed to shine gently. Crockta started laughing. The face was desolate but the eyes were shining like a child.</span></p><p><span>Crockta&#x2019;s skill had reached the Pinnacle level so Heart and Soul Penetration allowed him to clearly see the world.&#xA0;</span><span>His vision was clear.&#xA0;</span><span>His own face could be seen in those purple eyes.</span></p><p><span>Yes.</span></p><p><span>Crockta raised his greatsword.&#xA0;</span><span>In Driden&#x2019;s eyes, Crockta was smiling happily with the same eyes as Driden.</span></p><p><span>Crockta spoke, &#x201C;Driden. My name is Crockta.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;......&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;I would love to fight you properly, but it seems like this isn&#x2019;t the right time.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Crockta swung his greatsword as he finished speaking.&#xA0;</span><span>A black wave emerged along Ogre Slayer&#x2019;s trajectory.&#xA0;</span><span>It headed towards the dark elves who were blocking this place.</span></p><p><span>&quot;......!&quot;</span></p><p><span>Driden quickly muttered under his breath and a magic circle reappeared in the air.&#xA0;</span><span>A magic shield unfolded around Driden, but the ones outside it couldn&#x2019;t block Crockta&#x2019;s attack.&#xA0;</span><span>The ferocious energy slashed at the bodies of the dark elves and a fountain of blood appeared on the outskirts of Aden&#x2019;s group.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;What?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Aden freaked out.</span></p><p><span>&quot;Run!&quot;&#xA0;</span><span>Crockta carried the injured dark elf and immediately fled. Tiyo and Anor swiftly followed. The opponents didn&#x2019;t chase them.</span></p><p></p><p style="text-align: center"><span>***</span></p><p></p><p><span>They ran through Nameragon. They turned the corner several times. He didn&#x2019;t see a single person in the square where people originally gathered.</span></p><p><span>Sometimes dark elves would look at them through cracks in the window.</span></p><p><span>Crockta asked the injured dark elf, &quot;What is your position?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Right now, all of the civilians were hiding like mice. The fact that he was caught in this fight meant he was a soldier mobilized for the city&#x2019;s defense, or he had some type of relationship with Nameragon&#x2019;s leader.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;I...&quot;</span></p><p><span>The dark elf gazed at Crockta. He looked at Tiyo and Anor in turn before opening his mouth.</span></p><p><span>&quot;I am Adinio, the brother of Radet, who is the leader of Nameragon. I work as an administrator of Nameragon.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Crockta nodded.&#xA0;</span><span>&#x201C;So they were looking for you?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;They wanted to use me as a hostage to intimidate my brother. Aden is hurrying to catch my brother. Before &#x2018;he&#x2019; comes back.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;He?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;No matter how much Nameragon is lacking in battle resources, it was easy for Aden to strike because &#x2018;he&#x2019; was away.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span><span>Adinio&#x2019;s eyes shone.&#xA0;</span><span>&quot;The great magician, Jamero.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Jamero?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;He departed for Spinoa for a while. He is the one who has the most power in Nameragon. If he were here, then Aden would&#x2019;ve never done this.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Matters in Nameragon seemed complex.</span></p><p><span>Crock realized it once again. Ever since he started Elder Lord, he learned that there were no simple incidents. Desire and greed were entangled together, eventually leading to tragedy.&#xA0;</span><span>This truly resembled reality.</span></p><p><span>In the first place, was a skill to read someone&#x2019;s lifespan even possible?&#xA0;</span><span>The skill that the system presented him with, Gray God&apos;s Eyes.</span></p><p><span>Crockta remembered the face of someone who spoke to him with sad eyes. It was Gordon who wielded tremendous power with his sword.&#xA0;</span><span>He spoke about the Temple of the Fallen God. Everything was clearly connected.</span></p><p><span>He had to go there to find the answers.&#xA0;</span><span>In order to do that, he needed to save this place.</span></p><p><span>&quot;What are you going to do?&#x201D; asked Crockta.</span></p><p><span>At present, Crockta didn&#x2019;t know about the internal circumstances of Nameragon.&#xA0;</span><span>Adinio would be able to think of a better plan as the administrator. Crockta, Tiyo, and Anor watched him.</span></p><p><span>Adinio pondered for awhile before opening his mouth, &quot;Right now, they are trying to seize the City Hall. In particular, the skills of that person called Driden is too great...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;I agree.&quot;</span></p><p><span>Crockta nodded.</span></p><p><span>The dual wielding swordsman, Driden&#x2019;s abilities alone were enough to overwhelm the battlefield.&#xA0;</span><span>The pair of swords battered the target like a storm while attacks could be blocked with magic. Common soldiers would fall down like autumn leaves.</span></p><p><span>&quot;Let&#x2019;s go to City Hall and join my brother.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;How?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;There is a secret passage.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;A secret passage? Then, what if your brother escaped through the passage?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;No. Brother would never leave.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span><span>Adinio spoke firmly.&#xA0;</span><span>&quot;City Hall can&#x2019;t be passed over to Aden.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>All the information was contained in City Hall. There was top secret information about Nameragon that Aden couldn&#x2019;t be allowed to obtain.&#xA0;</span><span>It could endanger the entire dark elf alliance, including Nameragon and Spinoa.</span></p><p><span>&quot;He is such a person.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Um.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Crockta nodded.&#xA0;</span><span>It would be better to meet up with the person called Radet.&#xA0;</span><span>Adinio took the lead.&#xA0;</span><span>They turned back to the outskirts of the city. They occasionally met dark elves who sympathized with Aden but Tiyo and Crockta easily subdued them.</span></p><p><span>The group&#x2019;s weapons were taken away and they were tied up before heading out towards the secret passage again.&#xA0;</span><span>Adinio stopped when he reached an inn.&#xA0;</span><span>There was an inn in Nameragon that didn&#x2019;t exist in Nuridot. The size of the city was large so there was an inn.</span></p><p><span>Adinio checked that there was no one around and quietly opened the door.&#xA0;</span><span>The interior was quiet. The pub on the first floor that wouldn&#x2019;t normally be noisy was completely empty. Crockta, Tiyo, and Anor followed Adinio inside. Anor carefully closed the entrance.&#xA0;</span><span>The door was blocked and the sunlight entering cut off. Darkness filled the interior of the inn.</span></p><p><span>Adinio whispered, &#x201C;Reina.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>No one answered.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Reina?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>His voice rang through the inn.</span></p><p><i><span>Step.</span></i> <i><span>Step.</span></i></p><p><span>There was the sound of footsteps on the stairs connected to the above floor. They were light and nimble footsteps.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Adinio?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>A female dark elf appeared with a bow on her back and a sword in her hand.&#xA0;</span><span>She seemed to be checked the internal boundaries and lowered her sword once she saw Adinio.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;What is happening? Looking like that... and those people.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Thank god you&#x2019;re safe.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Adinio drew her into a hug. She relaxed and they exchanged greetings. Adinio introduced Crockta&#x2019;s group.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;They are the ones who helped me.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Perhaps, Crockta?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;How did you know?&quot;</span></p><p><span>&quot;I heard the rumors. I&#x2019;ve heard about you a few times from Radet. Are you really Crockta?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Crockta nodded. She sighed with relief.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;How fortunate. It is nice to meet you. I&apos;ve heard rumors that you are incredibly strong. Come in.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Tiyo coughed to announce his presence. His eyes expected a saga about him.&#xA0;</span><span>But she broke Tiyo&#x2019;s expectations.</span></p><p><span>&quot;The followers are here as well.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;......!&quot;</span></p><p><span>&#x2018;F-Follower...!&#x2019; Tiyo muttered with a devastated face. Crockta tapped on Tiyo&#x2019;s shoulder with an expression of victory.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Did anyone come from the passage?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;No, not yet.&quot;</span></p><p><span>They headed to the basement of the inn.&#xA0;</span><span>It was an old warehouse. There was a small door covered in a cloth behind a pile of junk. Reina shook off the dust.</span></p><p><span>&quot;Radet is safe, right?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;I&#x2019;m sure he is safe.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span> &#x201C;Yes... Please, Adinio.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Of course.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span><span>Adinio turned and looked at Crockta, Tiyo, and Anor.&#xA0;</span><span>&quot;This is a late thank you. Thank you for helping Nameragon despite having no relation to us.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;You&#x2019;re welcome.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Will you come help us once again?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Of course.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Thank you. I will surely repay you.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span><span>Adinio bowed his head. Then he exchanged glances with Reina.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Be careful.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;You too.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>The door to the secret passage was opened. A large tunnel appeared.&#xA0;</span><span>Adinio took a light and entered the tunnel first. Crockta, Tiyo, and Anor followed. Adinio&#x2019;s light lit up the tunnel.&#xA0;</span><span>The opening was narrow but it soon became a wide passage. It was so well made that it wouldn&#x2019;t collapse easily.</span></p><p><span>Sometimes when they walked, they could hear footsteps and vibrations above their heads. Perhaps a battle was occurring on top.&#xA0;</span><span>Adinio&#x2019;s pace increased. The light cast shadows at his gestures.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Go quickly.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Crockta also started running.&#xA0;</span><span>They ran around a few turns. Then at the end, a narrow space like the beginning appeared.&#xA0;</span><span>An iron door was beyond it.&#xA0;</span><span>Adinio crawled through the narrow tunnel and grabbed the iron door. It was old so it wouldn&#x2019;t open. Rust fell from it.</span></p><p><span>&quot;I&apos;ll try it.&quot;</span></p><p><span>Crockta went forward.&#xA0;</span><span>The two of them exchanged positions. Adinio was barely able to retreat behind Crockta.</span></p><p><span>Crockta grabbed the doorknob.&#xA0;</span><span>His muscles swelled as he pulled open the door.</span></p><p><i><span>Kiiiiik!</span></i></p><p><span>The iron door started to slowly open.&#xA0;</span><span>Crockta fell back as the door suddenly opened.</span></p><p><span>&quot;Ouch...&quot;</span></p><p><span>Adinio trembled after being hit by Crockta. Crockta apologized.</span></p><p><span>&quot;I&apos;m sorry.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;It&#x2019;s okay. Once inside...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>The iron door revealed another warehouse inside City Hall. There were many dusty tools piled up.&#xA0;</span><span>Crockta, Adinio, Tiyo, and Anor exited the tunnel.&#xA0;</span><span>The inside of City Hall was quiet.&#xA0;</span><span>Adinio led the way. They climbed the stairs of the warehouse, revealing a clean internal structure. City Hall was located in the north part of the city.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Brother would&#x2019;ve blocked the entrance to City Hall. I&#x2019;ll go up first.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;I understand.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Adinio climbed the stairs.&#xA0;</span><span>Loud noises started to gradually be heard.&#xA0;</span><span>They were able to meet a dark elf inside City Hall.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Who?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>As Adinio and Crockta reached the final steps, arrows and knives were aimed at them.</span></p><p><span>&quot;......!&quot;</span></p><p><span>It was a familiar face.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;You...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;I ended up seeing you again.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span><span>Crockta grinned.&#xA0;</span><span>The &#x2018;2 days&#x2019; was still floating above his head.&#xA0;</span><span>&quot;I told you. We can come in at any time. &quot;</span></p><p><span>It was Nameragon&#x2019;s defense captain who stopped Crockta from entering the gate.&#xA0;</span><span>His face distorted before turning towards Adinio and saying, &#x201C;Adinio! You led them here?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Yes.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;What are you...?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;They came to help us. What are you talking about?&#x201D;&#xA0;</span><span>Adinio frowned. He was in a bad mood.&#xA0;</span><span>&#x201C;If you are still willing to emphasize the dark elves&#x2019; pure blood in this situation, then shut up. Ironically, it is the pure blood dark elves attacking us now.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;......!&quot;</span></p><p><span>The captain&#x2019;s face flushed. </span></p><p><span>Adinio sighed and said, &quot;Now isn&#x2019;t the time to fight. Where is my brother?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;He is in the office.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>As they were talking, the dark elf soldiers were firing arrows through the windows.&#xA0;</span><span>It was to contain Aden&#x2019;s group who were looking for a way to enter the blocked City Hall.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;They will soon enter. In particular, the dark elf using double swords is strong. Crockta is required.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Adinio said soothingly. The guard&#x2019;s face calmed and he nodded.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;I know.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;I will go to see my brother. Crockta. Let&#x2019;s go together.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>He followed Adinio and they arrived at the office of Radet, leader of Nameragon.</span></p><p><span>The door opened.&#xA0;</span><span>The sight inside the office was completely different from what Crockta expected.</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p><p>My monthly Q&amp;A is on tonight on the Wuxiaworld Discord in 8 and a half hours.</p><p><a href="www.wuxiaworld.com">Glossary of Common Korean Terms.</a></p><p>Praise the Orc:&#xA0;<a href="docs.google.com">Glossary Link.&#xA0;</a></p><p>Current schedule:&#xA0;<strong>Next Patreon goal has been reached!!
