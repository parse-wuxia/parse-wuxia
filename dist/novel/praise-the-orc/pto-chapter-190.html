<p><span>Chapter 190 - Kill the Thunderbird (3)</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p><p><span>Zankus headed in a different direction from the ogres. Crockta&#x2019;s group followed him.</span></p><p><span>&quot;Is this the right direction <em>dot</em>?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;I don&apos;t know.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Zankus ran without looking back.&#xA0;</span><span>Crockta gauged the direction.&#xA0;</span><span>The ogres were traveling straight after the thunderbird, while Zankus was moving in a semicircle.&#xA0;</span><span>Looking at Zankus&#x2019;s trajectory, he had already guessed where the thunderbird&#x2019;s nest was.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Just follow Zankus.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>At that moment, one ogre appeared. It seemed to be a straggler from the group.&#xA0;</span><span>Their eyes met as the ogre showed its teeth. &#xA0;</span><span>Crockta pulled out God Slayer. The ogre&#x2019;s head &#xA0;suddenly exploded as an arrow had passed over Crockta&#x2019;s head and penetrated the ogre&#x2019;s skull.</span></p><p><span>Zankus. Zankus, who was in the lead, turned and shot an arrow with the huge bow.&#xA0;</span><span>The arrow was also big and looked like a spear.&#xA0;</span><span>Tiyo stopped and looked around after the arrow hit. For Tiyo, it was really oversized.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Coarse arrow <em>dot</em>.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>The arrow turned round and round.</span></p><p><span>&quot;I am also skilled in spear techniques!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Zankus smiled and turned around. Crockta&#x2019;s group watched him before following again.&#xA0;</span><span>They continued through the great forest.&#xA0;</span><span>Then a mountain rose in the distance. It was a steep slope, as if someone had artificially created it.&#xA0;</span><span>Ogres were climbing the bottom of this mountain</span></p><p><span>&quot;Hrmm...&quot;</span></p><p><span>Zankus loaded an arrow and watched the movements of the thunderbird.&#xA0;</span><span>He seemed to be thinking about something.</span></p><p><span>&quot;They are approaching.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>The ogres climbed the mountain like ants. It was an amazing sight.&#xA0;</span><span>Just a few ogres could cause a disaster in a city, but dozens of ogres had gathered to catch the thunderbird.&#xA0;</span><span>A few cities would be destroyed if this group was released onto the continent.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Thunderbird.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>The thunderbird felt the crisis and flew warily around its nest. Gusts of wind blew when it flapped its wings, causing a few ogres to topple over.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Kuwaaaaaah!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>The angry ogre wizard roared.&#xA0;</span><span>The thunderbird hurriedly flew higher but was hit by an unknown force. The thunderbird staggered as its feathers scattered every which way.</span></p><p><span>&quot;They are nearing.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Zankus and Crockta&#x2019;s group approached the mountain while watching the battle.&#xA0;</span><span>Suddenly, one ogre climbed to a flat area. The moment it was going to put its feet on the flat ground...</span></p><p><span>The thunderbird attacked the ogre. The ogre wielded a club. The huge bird and ogre tangled together.&#xA0;</span><span>The thunderbird&#x2019;s claws shredded the ogre&#x2019;s body. However, the bloody ogre resisted until the end.&#xA0;</span><span>The ogre wizard&#x2019;s magic tied up the thunderbird once again, allowing the ogre&#x2019;s club to hit it.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;The thunderbird is in danger <em>dot</em>!&#x201D; Tiyo shouted while watching.&#xA0;</span><span>Meanwhile, other ogres were on their way. Another ogre grabbed the tail feathers of the thunderbird. The thunderbird struggled wildly. The ogres fell down again.</span></p><p><span>The ogres persistently clung to the thunderbird. Like a swarm of ants, the ogres climbed onto the thunderbird&#x2019;s body. The ogres used their nails and teeth to harass the thunderbird.&#xA0;</span><span>The ogres kept attacking.</span></p><p><span>&quot;I don&#x2019;t know why it is fighting the ogres...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Thunderbirds were legendary because of their huge size, beautiful appearance and great speed, not for their strength in fighting.&#xA0;</span><span>The thunderbird that he knew would&#x2019;ve flown around snatching the one at a time, instead of tangling together like this.</span></p><p><span>&quot;I&#x2019;ll try to drop some.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Zankus aimed his arrow. His arm muscles swelled up. The giant spear was pulled back to the fullest.&#xA0;</span><span>Zankus&#x2019; archery was different from Shakan&#x2019;s.&#xA0;</span><span>He was like a cannon.</span></p><p><span>&quot;Bul&#x2019;tarrrr!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Zankus pulled the bowstring back all the way and let go.&#xA0;</span><span>The arrow burst out with a roar. It just the mountain just below where the thunderbird was struggling.</span></p><p><i><span>Kuaaaaaaang!</span></i></p><p><span>The whole mountain shook like there was an earthquake. The ogres barely clinging to the mountain fell at once.&#xA0;</span><span>The rear collapsed and the bodies of the ogres poured down in layers. The ogres on the bottom were crushed and died.&#xA0;</span><span>Most of the ogres approaching the thunderbird were washed away.</span></p><p><span>The thunderbird didn&#x2019;t miss this opportunity and moved. The ogres clinging to it fell off. Once its wings were free, the thunderbird grabbed two ogres and flew into the sky.&#xA0;</span><span>It rose to a high altitude and dropped the two ogres.&#xA0;</span><span>The ogres crashed. Their bodies couldn&#x2019;t withstand the shock of the fall and smashed to pieces.</span></p><p><span>The terrible shriek of the thunderbird echoed through the great forest. But the ogres didn&#x2019;t give up and climbed the mountain again.&#xA0;</span><span>The ogre wizard was screaming in anger while constantly sending magic towards the thunderbird.&#xA0;</span><span>As lightning flashed, the thunderbird moved its wings and avoided the attacks. The two of them stared at each other and moved.</span></p><p><span>Despite the ogres&#x2019; persistent attack, the thunderbird flew around its nest without escaping.</span></p><p><span>Zankus watched it and said, &quot;We must approach first.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Then he rushed quickly without listening to Crockta&#x2019;s reply, who followed with Tiyo.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Uhhhh...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>However, Anor didn&#x2019;t have the strength to move anymore.&#xA0;</span><span>The exhausted Anor stopped and caught his breath. He bowed his head and panted for a while.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Excuse me...?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>But the group had already gone too far.&#xA0;</span><span>Anor became despondent.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;More than this...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Anor used his magic power as the power of a necromancer unfolded.</span></p><p><span>&quot;Ah, this is?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>He stopped when he found what he was looking for. He put his hands together and concentrated his strength.&#xA0;</span><span>The earth was disturbed and a bony wing popped out.&#xA0;</span><span>Anor used the power of a necromancer to revive an animal that died not long ago, in order to ride it.</span></p><p><span>The shape was soon revealed.&#xA0;</span><span>The owner of the wings that let out an eerie cry!</span></p><p><span>&#x2018;Chirppppp....chirpppp....&#x2019;</span></p><p><span>An undead sparrow. The sparrow flew and sat on Anor&#x2019;s shoulder.</span></p><p><span>&#x2018;Chirpppppppp....&#x2019;</span></p><p><span>Anor dropped his arms.&#xA0;</span><span>The cry was eerier, but it was a cute bone sparrow.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Ah, I don&apos;t know.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Anor just sat down.&#xA0;</span><span>The sparrow kept on chirping on Anor&#x2019;s head.</span></p><p></p><p style="text-align: center"><span>***</span></p><p></p><p><span>Zankus approached the rear of the thunderbird&#x2019;s nest. Some of the ogres exploded because of his arrow.&#xA0;</span><span>His bow was destructive.&#xA0;</span><span>Zankus retried the arrows and carried them on his back again. Rather than an archer carrying arrows, he looked like a warrior with multiple spears.</span></p><p><span>&quot;Go this way.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span><span>The thunderbird was distracted by the ogres and wasn&#x2019;t paying attention to this side.&#xA0;</span><span>&quot;I will go up my own way. If you are confident, you can imitate me.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Zankus threw his huge arrow and stuck it in the rock wall.&#xA0;</span><span>Then he jumped up. The arrow bent and he used the recoil to fly up into the sky.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Ouh!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;......!&quot;</span></p><p><span>He used the tremendous jump and quickly reached a high place. He placed his hand in a rough niche and grabbed on.</span></p><p><span>&quot;Amazing.&quot;</span></p><p><span>He climbed up the cliff wall like a spider. He measured his position and where he wanted to go, then immediately jumped up.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Okay, me too!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Tiyo jumped on top of the arrow after Zankus. Tiyo bent down and jumped upwards.&#xA0;</span><span>His body was light, so he could fly much higher than Zankus. His body was small but he climbed quickly.&#xA0;</span><span>It was a curious sight.&#xA0;</span><span>The figures of Zankus and Tiyo became smaller.</span></p><p><span>&quot;Now it is my turn.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Crockta wiped his nose and jumped on the arrow.</span></p><p><i><span>Kwajijik!</span></i></p><p><span>But due to the shock that piled up, the part of the rock that the arrow was stabbed in fell down. Crockta also fell.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Cough!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>His body hit the ground and clouds of dust flew into the air.&#xA0;</span><span>After a while, the dirt covered Crockta rose.</span></p><p><span>&quot;Kyahahahahahat!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Tiyo&#x2019;s mocking laugh rang out from above.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Kulkul, kulkulkulkul.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span><span>Crockta laughed and said,&#xA0;</span><span>&quot;I&apos;m angry.&quot;</span></p><p><span>Crockta glared at the rock.&#xA0;</span><span>The angry Crockta didn&#x2019;t use any tricks.&#xA0;</span><span>He faced the opponent head on.&#xA0;</span><span>He stuck to the wall like a cicada. Then he started to climb up using his hands and legs. The angry Crockta&#x2019;s grip was tight as he found corners to support him.&#xA0;</span><span>It was an unstoppable climb, like there was something sticky on his hands.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span>Zankus and Tiyo felt an unknown crisis as Crockta climbed the rock like crazy.</span></p><p><span>&quot;Ohhhhhh!&quot;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Slow down, s-scary <em>dot</em>!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&quot;Ohhhhhh!&quot;</span></p><p><span>&quot;The rock is shaking <em>dot</em>!&quot;</span></p><p><span>Tiyo and Zankus moved faster as they felt like a monster was chasing them from behind.&#xA0;</span><span>They soon reached the slope.&#xA0;</span><span>The torn flesh of the ogres was scattered all over the place.&#xA0;</span><span>If they kept climbing up, they would reach the thunderbird&#x2019;s nest. However, the field of view was so clear that they couldn&#x2019;t avoid being seen by the thunderbird.</span></p><p><span>The thunderbird already noticed their presence, but it only glanced at Zankus and Tiyo while facing the ogres.</span></p><p><span>&quot;Weren&#x2019;t you going to hunt it? It looks okay now.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Crockta stepped on the slope and asked.&#xA0;</span><span>It was the perfect timing. The thunderbird wasn&#x2019;t paying attention to Zankus because it was fighting the ogres. If he aimed for a gap, the thunderbird wouldn&#x2019;t be able to avoid it.</span></p><p><span>&quot;I&#x2019;ll put it off for the moment.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span><span>Zankus looked up. He was looking at the thunderbird&#x2019;s nest on top of the steep mountain.&#xA0;</span><span>&#x201C;There is something I want to check.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Then Zankus once again loaded his arrow.&#xA0;</span><span>If Crockta&#x2019;s God Slayer was a greatsword, his bow was a ballista.&#xA0;</span><span>He fired the arrow.&#xA0;</span><span>The goal wasn&#x2019;t the thunderbird.&#xA0;</span><span>Ogre wizard.&#xA0;</span><span>The huge arrow hit the ogre wizard&#x2019;s shoulder.&#xA0;</span><span>In the aftermath, the ogre wizard collapsed to the ground. Blood flowed from the wounded area. The ogre wizard roared angrily.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Kuwaaaaaah!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>The ogre wizard became crazy and started to attack the thunderbird with all its power. The ogre wizard wanted to kill everyone on this mountain.&#xA0;</span><span>It aimed a spell towards the thunderbird. The thunderbird rose and then plummeted towards the ogre wizard.</span></p><p><span>The ogres clung to the thunderbird. The ogre wizard&#x2019;s magic power burned the target, not distinguishing between ogres and the thunderbird.&#xA0;</span><span>The ogres were torn apart by the thunderbird&#x2019;s claws and wings. Blood splashed and lightning flashed.</span></p><p><span>It was a melee.</span></p><p><span>&quot;Let&apos;s go up.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Zankus distracted the thunderbird and started climbing again.&#xA0;</span><span>His speed increased.</span></p><p></p><p style="text-align: center"><span>***</span></p><p></p><p><span>The summit of the mountain.&#xA0;</span><span>They reached the place where the thunderbird&#x2019;s nest was located.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Here <em>dot</em>!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>Tiyo pointed to a cave. It was a space that the thunderbird had carved out directly. It was a nesting place that was protected from bad weather by a hard outer wall.</span></p><p><span>&quot;Why did we come here <em>dot</em>?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;Shh.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span><span>Zankus raised a finger to his mouth.</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;......?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;This...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>A sound was coming from the nest.&#xA0;</span><span>Crockta and Tiyo listened carefully.</span></p><p><span>Crockta asked in a small voice,&#xA0;</span><span>&#x201C;Did you know?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>&#x201C;I just guessed.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span>They entered the cave.&#xA0;</span><span>An unexpected sight greeted them.</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p><p><a href="www.wuxiaworld.com">Glossary of Common Korean Terms.</a></p><p>Praise the Orc:&#xA0;<a href="docs.google.com">Glossary Link.&#xA0;</a></p><p>Current schedule:&#xA0;There will now be 14 chapters a week, meaning two chapters every day.</p><p>I have also updated my&#xA0;<a href="www.patreon.com">Patreon</a>&#xA0;to reflect my new novels.
