<p><strong>Chapter 67: A Letter</strong></p><p>Ping Fangrou was pretty but not beautiful, with a charming smile that radiated sincerity. She wore ordinary garments, and was unarmed. Strapped at her waist was a corked gourd bottle with the character &#x201C;alcohol&#x201D; painted on it.</p><p>Clasping hands formally, she said, &#x201C;Greetings, Dragon Sovereign Sunan. Greetings, Phoenix Sovereign Bao. I am Ping Fangrou of the Timeless Heroes, loyal disciple of the Timeless Master. Because of the unique style of martial arts I&#x2019;ve developed, my friends call me the Drunken Crane. I am here to offer formal greetings on the behalf of the Timeless Master, and to deliver a message.</p><p>&#x201C;Dragon Sovereign, Phoenix Sovereign, it was not my intention to interrupt your feast. I&#x2019;ll take my leave now and return in the morning.&#x201D; With that, she bowed and prepared to leave.</p><p>&#x201C;Hold on,&#x201D; Bao said. &#x201C;There&#x2019;s no need to leave. Please, join us!&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Yes, please do,&#x201D; Sunan added. &#x201C;I&#x2019;m curious about this unique martial art of yours.&#x201D;</p><p>Ping Fangrou&#x2019;s smile lit up the room as she once again clasped hands. &#x201C;If you insist!&#x201D;</p><p>The tables were rearranged so that Ping Fangrou could sit near Bao and Sunan. Food and drink were served, and a few pleasantries were exchanged.</p><p>Then, Ping Fangrou filled her drinking vessel. Almost immediately, the fragrant aroma of sorghum wine rose up.</p><p>&#x201C;Sorghum wine!&#x201D; she said, her eyes lighting up. &#x201C;It seems the rumors are true!&#x201D;</p><p>Sunan filled his own glass and looked over at her. &#x201C;Rumors?&#x201D;</p><p>Ping Fangrou chuckled. &#x201C;Forgive me, Dragon Sovereign. Most stories about the Young Dragon and the Fierce Phoenix have to do with your adventures and martial arts. But other stories exist that I find more interesting. I&#x2019;d heard that the two of you are fond of sorghum wine, although I&#x2019;d always wondered if it was true or not.&#x201D; She looked at Bao. &#x201C;I&#x2019;ve also heard that you are especially skilled in the arts of drinking, Phoenix Sovereign.&#x201D;</p><p>Bao smiled. &#x201C;I won&#x2019;t deny it, Heroine Ping.&#x201D; She raised her cup. &#x201C;Welcome to the Dragon-Phoenix Sect. I wish you good health and long life!&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Many thanks! I will drain my cup, but please do not feel obliged to follow suit!&#x201D; With that, Ping drained the entire cup of sorghum wine.</p><p>&#x201C;Don&#x2019;t drink too quickly, Heroine Ping!&#x201D; Sunan said, chuckling.</p><p>Ping smiled and refilled her drinking vessel. &#x201C;Fear not, Dragon Sovereign. The truth is that I&#x2019;m somewhat of an expert when it comes to drinking. Actually, my style of martial arts benefits from the boost provided by a healthy bit of alcohol!&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Really?&#x201D; Bao said, clearly intrigued.</p><p>&#x201C;Really!&#x201D; Ping Fangrou replied. &#x201C;With enough alcohol inside of me, I&#x2019;m almost impossible to hit! And my blows become difficult to predict and counter.&#x201D;</p><p>Bao laughed in response.</p><p>Ping Fangrou raised an eyebrow. &#x201C;Phoenix Sovereign, I&#x2019;m not joking! I can demonstrate if you&#x2019;d like, but I need to drink a bit more.&#x201D;</p><p>Bao was slightly taken aback, but could see the sincerity in Ping Fangrou&#x2019;s expression. They continued to eat, drink, and chat, until roughly two hours had passed. Every time Ping Fangrou drank, she drained her cup, but encouraged those she was drinking with to drink more slowly.</p><p>Gradually, her eyes became slightly cloudy, and her speech just barely slurred.</p><p>Eventually, the conversation returned to martial arts. By that point, despite the fact that Ping Fangrou had drunk more than anyone else, she actually seemed to be less inebriated than before.</p><p>Bao&#x2019;s head was spinning slightly as she said, &#x201C;Heroine Ping, I really am intrigued by this martial arts style of yours. What do you say to an exhibition match? You and me. Right here, right now!&#x201D;</p><p>Ping Fangrou&#x2019;s eyes widened. &#x201C;Oh no, Phoenix Sovereign. I&#x2019;m definitely not worthy of your martial arts. Besides, you&#x2019;re clearly much more skilled and powerful than me!&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Nonsense,&#x201D; Bao said, rising to her feet. &#x201C;I can tell that you&#x2019;re not much behind me. And I promise not to use any of my more powerful techniques. Please, humor me!&#x201D; She extended her hand toward the open space in the middle of the room.</p><p>Ping Fangrou hesitated for a moment, but then her smile widened and she stood up. &#x201C;Very well, Phoenix Sovereign, if you insist!&#x201D;</p><p>As she walked over toward the open area, she suddenly stumbled, lurching to the left and almost falling onto the ground before jerking her torso back in the opposite direction and then shuffling to a stop. Chuckles could be heard from the crowd of gathered members of the Dragon Phoenix Sect.</p><p>&#x201C;Be careful, Heroine Ping!&#x201D; someone called out.</p><p>&#x201C;Yeah, don&#x2019;t get yourself knocked out before the fighting begins.&#x201D;</p><p>Ping Fangrou turned to face Bao, swaying back and forth in place.</p><p>Bao took a ready stance. &#x201C;Are you sure you&#x2019;re up to a fight, Heroine Ping?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Of course,&#x201D; she replied, striking a stance. It was an odd stance in which she leaned back slightly and held her hands loosely out in front of her, her fingers curled as if holding a drinking vessel.</p><p>&#x201C;Is there a name for this stance of yours?&#x201D; Bao asked.</p><p>Ping Fangfrou chuckled. &#x201C;Stance of the Drunken Cat! Phoenix Sovereign, please, you make the first move.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Very well.&#x201D; Without any hesitation, Bao dashed forward and lashed out with a palm strike. She didn&#x2019;t draw upon any powerful technique, but instead stuck to an ordinary blow. She even held back a bit of strength.</p><p>However, just when she was sure her palm strike was about to land on her opponent&#x2019;s shoulder, Ping Fangrou suddenly twisted and stumbled to the side, and Bao&#x2019;s palm struck nothing but air.</p><p>The slightest of frowns could be seen on Bao&#x2019;s face as she spun, sending a kick flying toward Ping Fangrou&#x2019;s waist.</p><p>However, Ping Fangrou swiveled in a circle, and Bao&#x2019;s foot caught nothing but fabric. Bao&#x2019;s frown deepened.</p><p>&#x201C;You&#x2019;ll have to do better than that, Phoenix Sovereign!&#x201D; Ping Fangrou said with a respectful nod of her head.</p><p>Bao threw a few more palm strikes and kicks, and yet Ping Fangrou evaded every single one. Bao was soon fighting at full strength, but whenever her blows were about to land, Ping Fangrou twisted or lurched or stumbled in an unpredictable way.</p><p>By this point, Bao&#x2019;s frown had turned into a smile. &#x201C;Very impressive! Alright, no more holding back. See if you can dodge my Fury of the Phoenix.&#x201D;</p><p>Without any further hesitation, she swept her arms through the air, unleashing a wide beam of blinding, white light that sped directly toward Ping Fangrou.</p><p>&#x201C;Woah!&#x201D; Ping Fangrou blurted. &#x201C;Drunken Dodge!&#x201D; With that, she bent, dipped, and weaved in an elegant flow of drunkenness, narrowly evading Bao&#x2019;s Fury of the Phoenix.</p><p>&#x201C;I think I need to learn a few of your moves, Heroine Ping!&#x201D; Bao said. &#x201C;However, I have a question&#x2026;.&#x201D; Even as she spoke, Bao unleashed a few more kicks and palm strikes, all of which Ping Fangrou evaded.</p><p>&#x201C;Ask away, Phoenix Sovereign. I could do this all day.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Can you do anything but dodge? Fury of the Phoenix!&#x201D; She swept her arms out again, sending another wide beam of light shooting toward Ping Fangrou.</p><p>Ping Fangrou yet again evaded the blast. &#x201C;I wouldn&#x2019;t dare to strike at you, Phoenix Sovereign!&#x201D;</p><p>Bao grinned. &#x201C;If you don&#x2019;t, then I&#x2019;m going to knock you flat on your face! Phoenix Torment!&#x201D; Bao&#x2019;s finger shot with lightning-like speed toward Ping Fangrou&#x2019;s neck.</p><p>Just when she was sure that her blow would land, Ping Fangrou said, &#x201C;Dip of the Drunken Cobra!&#x201D; Her torso then bent back at a seemingly impossible angle, causing Bao&#x2019;s blow to swing wide. Ping Fangrou&#x2019;s head nearly touched the ground before she suddenly sprang back and thrust her palm toward Bao&#x2019;s shoulder.</p><p>Bao&#x2019;s eyes went wide, but there was no time for her to adjust her momentum.</p><p>-SMACK-</p><p>Ping Fangrou&#x2019;s blow landed!</p><p>It was a mundane attack, not a powerful martial arts technique, but it was a blow nonetheless, and Bao, already drunk and off balance, stumbled backward.</p><p>Gasps rang out in the room, and everything went quiet</p><p>At the same time, the blood drained from Ping Fangrou&#x2019;s face, and she suddenly didn&#x2019;t seem drunk at all.</p><p>A moment of silence passed, which actually lasted for only the briefest of moments, but which to Ping Fangrou seemed like an eternity. Then she clasped hands and bowed deeply.</p><p>&#x201C;Phoenix Sovereign, please forgive my impertinence!&#x201D;</p><p>Bao brushed her shoulder off and then suddenly laughed. &#x201C;Are you kidding me! That was amazing! Incredible!&#x201D;</p><p>As Bao hurried forward to lift Ping Fangrou up from her bow, Sunan began to clap, then Mao Yun, then Li Runfa, until soon the entire room was cheering. Ping Fangrou smiled, and her cheeks turned a bit more flush than they had been before.</p><p>&#x201C;Come come,&#x201D; Bao said. &#x201C;Let&#x2019;s sit and talk more about this drunken martial art of yours! How did you come up with it?!&#x201D;</p><p>**</p><p>The following morning, many in the sect woke with pounding heads and dry throats. After a morning of recovery, preparations began to move the sect. As the members of the sect bustled about packing belongings and readying pack animals, Bao and Sunan met again with Ping Fangrou, who requested that only the three of them were present.</p><p>&#x201C;It is with great pleasure and solemnity that I offer you this message from the Timeless Master,&#x201D; she said, holding out a sealed envelope with both hands.</p><p>Sunan took it respectfully, and then broke the seal.</p><p>&#x201C;Dragon Sovereign,&#x201D; Ping Fangrou said, &#x201C;the Timeless Master insisted that only the two of you read the letter, although not out loud. He also requested that you burn the letter after reading it.&#x201D;</p><p>Sunan&#x2019;s eyes widened, but after a moment he nodded. &#x201C;I understand.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;I&#x2019;ll take my leave then,&#x201D; Ping Fangrou said, hurrying out of the tent.</p><p>With that, Sunan pulled the letter out of the envelope and unfolded it. After glancing it over, he handed it to Bao. &#x201C;You read it first. You read faster anyway.&#x201D;</p><p>Bao began to read the letter silently</p><p></p><p style="padding-left: 60px"><em>Dragon Sovereign.
