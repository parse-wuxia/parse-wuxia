<p><strong>Chapter 75: Shocked To The Core!</strong></p><p>&#x201C;You&#x2019;ve heard tales of Mount Zhizhu, correct?&#x201D; Li Buwei asked.</p><p>Sunan and Bao nodded.</p><p>&#x201C;Of course you have,&#x201D; Li Buwei continued. &#x201C;Everyone has at least heard tales about the enormous mountain upon which Qi Xien and all the other lands rest. However, imagine for a moment the distance involved if you traveled from Yu Zhing, which overlooks the Mei Lien Sea, all the way to Fal Tasu in Naqan, which looks out over the Huo Sea. Do you know how far that is?&#x201D;</p><p>Bao&#x2019;s eyes turned up in thought for a moment. &#x201C;An immense distance&#x2026;. Perhaps 3,000 kilometers?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Closer to 5,000,&#x201D; Li Buwei said. &#x201C;Now take that distance and double it. That is how far down Mount Zhizhu stretches into the ocean.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;The oceans are 10,000 kilometers deep?&#x201D; Sunan asked, shocked.</p><p>&#x201C;On average, yes. The Zhizhu Coral comes from such depths, from the very base of Mount Zhizhu itself. As such, you can imagine how valuable it would be even if it were nothing more than an ordinary piece of coral. As for how my father managed to acquire it, even I don&#x2019;t know.</p><p>&#x201C;Of course, it is much more than a simple piece of coral. It was once a part of Mount Zhizhu, the very mountain upon which our entire world rests and survives, and as such, it is connected to the fabric of reality of which we are part. It is a connection that will remain in place for all eternity, at least, as long as the coral and the mountain both exist.</p><p>&#x201C;The resonance between the coral and the mountain manifests as powerful, magical fluctuations that pour out from the coral. Only the most powerful of magic users would be able to sense the fluctuations, and even then, only after performing certain rituals and spells. Which is exactly what my father did. In any case, the fluctuations affect all living beings within a certain radius of the coral, stirring their hearts and minds, slowly fostering a sense of euphoria.</p><p>&#x201C;The effect takes time, and would be virtually impossible to identify as something out of the ordinary, at least up to a point. Essentially, the Zhizhu Coral makes everyone around it feel happy. However, once it reaches a certain level, the euphoria will begin to turn into a mania that rapidly devolves into insanity.</p><p>&#x201C;The Zhizhu Coral is one of ways that my father has managed to subdue and control Qi Xien. By moving the coral from city to city within his domain, he keeps the populace inexplicably happy. The effect created will last for many months after the coral is gone, allowing my father to essentially suppress any negative emotions in the places he controls, or to quickly win over the populace of newly conquered cities.&#x201D;</p><p>Li Buwei shook his head. &#x201C;In my opinion, it is an insidious and vile method of control. Removing the Zhihu Coral from his arsenal of tools is merely one step in the long-term plan to remove him from power.&#x201D;</p><p>Bao and Sunan had not even been given time to recover from their shock regarding Li Buwei&#x2019;s identity, only to be slammed with this new bit of shocking information. Apparently, Li Buwei was finished with his explanation, as he maintained his silence and simply looked over at them.</p><p>After a long moment passed, Bao said, &#x201C;What will you do with the coral? Destroy it?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;No. I fear that damaging the resonance between the coral and Mount Zhizhu could have catastrophic ramifications. I plan to seal it with magic and then bury it in a place no one will ever find it. I&#x2019;m not sure if you&#x2019;re aware, but many of the mountains in these lands contain caverns and tunnels which naturally inhibit magical fluctuations. They are like voids in the world around us. There is one particular mountain in Suk territory to the west that has such void pockets. Perhaps that is where I will bury the Zhizhu Coral. Right under my father&#x2019;s nose, so to speak....&#x201D;</p><p>The conversation went on for a few more minutes, after which they returned to the dining hall. The match between Tie Gangwen and Qian Chengsi had ended, and another match had begun, pitting one of the Claws of the Phoenix against one of the Timeless Master&#x2019;s most powerful fighters.</p><p>Everyone was in very high spirits.</p><p>**</p><p>The Dragon-Phoenix Sect stayed in the Grotto of the Timeless Master for a full week. Martial arts tips were exchanged, and bonds formed.</p><p>For the first time, the members of the Dragon-Phoenix Sect felt as if they were truly a part of the newly forming world of martial arts that existed in Qi Xien. They had brothers- and sisters-in-arms, fellow heroes who were willing to fight and risk their lives for the good of the people. For their home.</p><p>Of course, Sunan and Bao spent many hours in private discussing Li Buwei&#x2019;s shocking revelations. In the end, they could find no reason to distrust him, and even went to the extent of reassuring him of their intentions to support his cause.</p><p>At dawn on the eighth day, it was with much ceremony that the Timeless Master saw them off. He even personally escorted them to the Zun River, and their boats. That was where the true farewells were said, and the Dragon-Phoenix Sect began to make their way west up the Zun River, toward Zun Shan.</p><p>The trip was relatively uneventful. On a few occasions, they made contact with local tribes, engaging in trade at one point, and even picking up a new recruit or two. Eventually they reached Zhaoze Swamp, a misty, dank place that abounded with mosquitos, snakes, and a variety of other unsavory beasts.</p><p>On one occasion they even saw a flying crocodile, whereupon Bao said, &#x201C;Remember that old man we fought?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Up north?&#x201D; Sunan replied. &#x201C;Yes. I wonder what happened to him? He was no weakling.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;That old man?&#x201D; Wang Tian said. &#x201C;He goes by the name Kind Devil Fuling. After his run-in with you, he&#x2019;s only ever been seen in the Dai Bien Forest. Rumor has it he&#x2019;s taken up with Hua Pi the Skin Dancer.&#x201D;</p><p>The Zhaoze swamp was so large that it could take days to travel from one end to the other. However, instead of following the river west, which would have led them to the very same trading post where they had defeated the Bone General, they headed north along a tributary that led to Heiping Valley and Lake Liyu. Roughly a day after the swamp gave way to jungle, they reached one of the most impressive sights south of the Banyan Mountains.</p><p>The Falls of Sura.</p><p>One of the tallest waterfalls in all the lands, it sent water crashing down fully a thousand meters.</p><p>Cut into the mountain rock next to the waterfall was a steep staircase leading up to the area beyond.</p><p>It was a hair-raising climb, but everyone made it safely, after which they retraced the same path back to Zun Shan that they had taken after the final encounter with the Bone General.</p><p>After returning to the palace, preparations began for the wedding.</p><p>An auspicious date was set during the first lunar month, and invitations were sent out to key figures in the martial arts world, such as the Scorpion Swordsman and the Timeless Master.</p><p>As the date approached, the activity in the sect reached a fever pitch. The entire palace was thoroughly cleaned and decorated, and much work went into the crafting of spectacular wedding garments for both Sunan and Bao.</p><p>Important martial artists from across the empire arrived one after another, even the Timeless Master. Much to the delight of both Sunan and Bao, Sun Mai returned, along with his most trusted apprentices, who had once been members of the Dragon-Phoenix Sect themselves. Most members of the Dragon-Phoenix Sect were recalled from their various missions and assignments throughout the empire.</p><p>Because of all the hustle and bustle, there was no time to sit down and reminisce with Sun Mai. However, both Sunan and Bao could tell at a single glance that he had changed since they last seen him. At one point, he and Sunan clasped forearms, whereupon Sunan&#x2019;s eyes went wide.</p><p>Leaning forward, he lowered his voice and said, &#x201C;Sun Mai, your martial arts&#x2026; how far have you progressed?&#x201D;</p><p>A faint, enigmatic smile appeared on Sun Mai&#x2019;s face. &#x201C;Far. Very far.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;You&#x2019;ve surpassed me, haven&#x2019;t you!?&#x201D;</p><p>Sun Mai nodded slightly. &#x201C;I&#x2019;ve reached a level of mastery that I would say is profound to say the least. After the wedding, we can sit down and discuss it a bit more.&#x201D;</p><p>Although the occasion was a wedding, this was also one of the first times in which the top figures of the martial arts world gathered together in one place. There were some whispers of fear regarding what would happen if someone chose attack them in this moment, but everyone was confident that with so many top-level fighters together, not even the Demon Emperor would be so stupid.</p><p>When the actual day of the wedding came, Sunan donned his wedding garment, which was crafted from crimson brocade silk, embroidered with nine golden dragons that were so lifelike they seemed to be on the verge of leaping off of the garment and flying about in the room.</p><p>Sheathed at Sunan&#x2019;s waist was his Wind Sabre, for which Ruan the Flamingo had crafted a beautiful scabbard of red lacquered leather, inlaid with a design of blue pearls that flowed like the wind. Although no one would be able to tell just by looking at it, the scabbard contained a spell formation which focused the energies of the Wind Sabre in on itself, allowing it to build up shocking levels of power the longer it remained sheathed.</p><p>As for Bao, she decided to buck the long-standing traditions of Qi Xien and wear a blue wedding gown. None of the wedding guests had ever seen a blue wedding gown before, but it matched perfectly with her Phoenix Crown, and was embroidered with a single silver phoenix that seemed even more lifelike than the nine dragons on Sunan&#x2019;s garment. The phoenix&#x2019;s eyes were made from rubies that glittered brilliantly even during the dark of night. Of course, when wearing her Phoenix Crown, she was careful with her wording so as not to unwittingly unleash its power upon the guests.</p><p>Bao and Sunan also forwent many of the customary traditions for Qi Xien weddings, which would eventually become a precedent among members of the martial world.</p><p>The ceremony itself was simple. They kowtowed to heaven, to earth, and to the Timeless Master. Then they shared a cup of tea.</p><p>As simple as that, and they were married. Bao put away the Phoenix Crown as soon as possible, still fearing that it might accidentally wreak havoc.</p><p>Then the banquet began.</p><p>There was much toasting, followed by performances and acts of all sorts and kinds. Ten of the most beautiful female disciples from the Pure Phoenix Division performed a graceful dance, and several of the Golden Dragons played a ballad. One of Sun Mai&#x2019;s apprentices, Shisan, recited a 1,500-year-old poem written by Emperor Lin from the Era of the Thundering March. Three of the Timeless Master&#x2019;s disciples performed a comedic interpretation of the Goddess Xian Nu Shen creating the world.</p><p>Later, there were martial arts performances. Ping Fangrou had a new drunken kung fu routine, and Flying Death Li Jiahui had recently invented a Qinggong technique that left everyone in the audience gasping in awe. Tie Gangwen and Hero Qian Chengsi had an exhibition match that turned out to be more a comedy routine than a fight. Tie Gangwen repeatedly used the fact that he was missing an arm to flummox Qian Chengsi, but was eventually defeated after Qian Chengsi bound his left leg up. The &#x201C;One-Armed One-Legged Duel of Legend&#x201D; quickly became the talk of the martial world.</p><p>Eventually, the time gave to give gifts. There were almost too many to count, everything from weapons to clothing to books.</p><p>The Timeless Master provided them with an ornamental rock that he mentioned, in passing, came from another world. Sun Mai handed them a bamboo scroll, personally written by him, which he said was the second volume of his scripture.</p><p>However, the most impressive of all the gifts came from an unlikely subject. Du Qian.</p><p>He preceded his gift with much fanfare and even a flowery speech, after which he left for a few minutes. When he returned with the gift, everyone was left shocked to the core!</p><p>--</p><p>Get extra content related to this chapter on the <a href="thebedrockblog.blogspot.com" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Bedrock Blog</a>!</p>
