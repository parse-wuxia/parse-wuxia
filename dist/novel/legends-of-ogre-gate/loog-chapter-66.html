<p><strong>Chapter 66: Ping</strong></p><p>The Speaker produced a conch shell so weathered by time that it looked like a stone teardrop. Its surface was as smooth as jade, and it was just barely possible to see arcane magical symbols and designs carved into the surface. The Speaker raised the conch shell to the mouth on his stomach, and then blew into the end.</p><p>A blast of wind emerged from the other end of the shell, which, when it touched the violet flames, sent sparks showering out in all directions. The sparks swirled through the cave, spinning around and around until they formed a vortex. With each moment that ticked by, each spark began to shine, until the violet light filling the cave was so bright that Sunan and Bao both closed their eyes.</p><p>Everything went still, and then a rushing sound filled their ears.</p><p>They opened their eyes to find themselves flying through the air. When they looked down and around, they didn&#x2019;t see their bodies. It felt as if they were simply the wind, streaming through the air. Next to them were five other streams of wind, which were the other True Shan.</p><p>One might think that being the wind would impart a feeling of freedom, but it was actually the opposite. They were like drops of water in a river, tiny streams of wind in a raging torrent that swept through the sky. Whispering, murmuring voices echoed in their ears, although it was impossible to make out any distinct words.</p><p>A moment later, the voice of the Speaker could be heard, faint, as if it were coming from the other side of the world.</p><p><em>Don&#x2019;t struggle. We will follow the winds wherever they take us.</em></p><p>They were flying along a mountain range filled with towering peaks and stunning valleys. They raced along until the mountains began to drop down toward the ground. Then a body of water became visible up ahead.</p><p><em>That&#x2019;s the Yao Yun Sea!</em> Bao said. Or thought. She wasn&#x2019;t sure which. They flew along the edge of the sea until a city rose up on the horizon. <em>Yu Zhing! </em></p><p>The winds swept them past Yu Zhing and then north, swirling around the mountain Gor Shan before speeding up the Fei River. They passed Fan, following the river west. Bao was almost sure she caught a glimpse of the inn where she and Mao Yun had first gotten drunk together all those years ago.</p><p><em>Are we going to Mount Fohe?</em> Sunan wondered.</p><p>They were not.</p><p>Halfway up the Fei River, something changed. Before, they had been speeding along completely unobstructed. But suddenly, the winds around them trembled. Then, they were tugged off course, pulled south, away from the river.</p><p>In addition to the rushing sound of winds, rumbling sounds filled the air.</p><p><em>What&#x2019;s this?</em> the Speaker asked. <em>The winds are being pulled south against their will&#x2026;.</em></p><p>As they shot south, mountains rose up ahead of them. Just barely visible in one location in those mountains was a towering palace.</p><p><em>Is that&#x2026;?</em> Bao said.</p><p><em>Yao Gong Palace?</em> Sunan continued.</p><p>The Speaker suddenly spoke in an urgent voice. <em>The lair of the Demon King. This wind dream has been interfered with. We must leave!</em></p><p>As they sped toward the palace, they saw a black tempest spring into being, surrounding the entire palace. Then, golden light began to shine up into the heavens. When Bao and Sunan looked up, they realized to their shock that the sun, the moon, and two dazzlingly bright stars had formed a square up above. Moments later, golden clouds began to fill the sky.</p><p>The winds around them were screaming, not because of the speed with which they flowed, but because of fear. Terror.</p><p>Sunan and Bao felt themselves shaking violently as a golden-colored rain began to fall around them.</p><p>Then their eyes opened.</p><p>**</p><p>In the middle of the Banyan Region was a mountain that would, in later generations, come to be called Mount Heiping. As a young girl, Hui had once traveled with her master to a secret temple on Mount Heiping. The sect there had been their ally in resisting the Demon King, and she had learned much from them.</p><p>After her encounter with the Love General, she decided that she needed to rethink her mission, and seek enlightenment on how to proceed. She had traveled south, surpassing the slowly-moving Dragon Phoenix Sect and entering the Banyan ahead of them. Just as Bao and Sunan had recently done, she rafted down the Southern Fei, then hiked through the jungle to Mount Heiping.</p><p>Along the way, she encountered a few dangerous situations, but nothing a Profound Master like herself couldn&#x2019;t handle.</p><p>To her surprise, she found that in the location of that future secret temple, there was already a structure in existence. It was also a temple, clearly an ancient one at that, little more than an outline of walls, almost completely overrun by vegetation.</p><p>Something about the place seemed to resonate with her, leading her to wonder who might have built such a structure, and why it had been erected in this specific location.</p><p>After clearing out a space for herself and erecting a temporary shelter, she sat down cross-legged to meditate.</p><p>Time flew by, and considering how engrossed she was in meditation, she lost track of the specifics. One day, only moments after the Speaker took out his conch shell far to the north, a tremor ran through Hui. Then her hand twitched, and suddenly, she opened her eyes and shot to her feet.</p><p>&#x201C;Someone has interfered with my Trance Touch Incantation.&#x201D;</p><p>**</p><p>Countless violet sparks fell down to the ground of the cave, where they danced spasmodically until they faded into nothing.</p><p>The Speaker slumped in place. Sweat covered his body, and it was the same with the other True Shan, as well as Bao and Sunan.</p><p>&#x201C;What was that?&#x201D; Bao asked.</p><p>&#x201C;My dream,&#x201D; Sunan said, reaching up to massage his temples.</p><p>Surprise flashed in her eyes. &#x201C;You mean <em>the </em>dream?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Yes.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;You&#x2019;ve had that dream before?&#x201D; the Speaker asked.</p><p>Sunan nodded. &#x201C;Something like it. Black winds. Golden light. Rain.&#x201D;</p><p>Bao thought for a moment, then said, &#x201C;And then there&#x2019;s my poetry&#x2026;.&#x201D;</p><p>They proceeded to explain a bit about their dreams and poetry. The Speaker listened thoughtfully, and when they were finished, he sat quietly for a long moment.</p><p>&#x201C;It is very rare for a wind dream to be disturbed. Not even the wind god Gushan would do such a thing.&#x201D; His eyes turned up in thought. &#x201C;Well &#x2026; perhaps that isn&#x2019;t necessarily true. Or could it be that&#x2026;.&#x201D; He lapsed into silence.</p><p>After another long moment, he sighed. &#x201C;I must confer with my brothers and sisters about this. For now, please retire to the quarters which have been prepared for you. You may use the Empyral Hammer, but may not take it with you. It must be used in the forges here in the valley. Take this.&#x201D; A command medallion appeared in his hand that appeared to be crafted from shells. He tossed it to Sunan. &#x201C;If we achieve any enlightenment regarding the wind dream, we will call for you.&#x201D;</p><p>**</p><p>Ruan went to work immediately, and the days began to pass. As for the rest of the group, they spent time training and sparring. A few of the members of the Shan Tribe were already proficient in the cultivation of Qi, and had begun to fuse it with their traditional fighting style. Although none of them were as powerful as Bao or Sunan, the diversity of their combat arts provided new insights to the members of the Dragon Phoenix Sect.</p><p>An entire month went by. On a few occasions during that time, Sunan almost brought himself to give the cloth bracelet to Bao, but never did.</p><p>One day, Ruan returned from the forges with a long wooden box. It was a simply crafted, decorated with a carving of a dragon that had powerful gusts of wind surrounding it.</p><p>&#x201C;It&#x2019;s done,&#x201D; Ruan announced, handing the box to Sunan.</p><p>&#x201C;Is it safe to open?&#x201D;</p><p>Ruan nodded. &#x201C;It was very difficult to contain the power of the wind. But the job is done.&#x201D;</p><p>Sunan opened the box to reveal what appeared to be an ordinary Ox-Tail Dao.</p><p>&#x201C;It took shape on its own,&#x201D; Ruan explained. &#x201C;Just like the Phoenix Crown. To be honest, I&#x2019;m not sure what its powers are.&#x201D;</p><p>Sunan reached into the box and grabbed the sabre by the hilt. When he did, he felt a tingling sensation in his arm, like a wind flowing through him. The effect faded away quickly.</p><p>He performed a few forms with the sabre.</p><p>&#x201C;Good weight and balance,&#x201D; he commented.</p><p>After a few moves in which nothing out of the ordinary happened, he shrugged. &#x201C;Perhaps it needs to be used in real combat to reveal its powers.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Likely so,&#x201D; Ruan said. &#x201C;The power of the wind from that stone is definitely inside of it.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;What should I call it?&#x201D; Sunan mused.</p><p>&#x201C;The Ox-Tail Dao of Tempests?&#x201D; Mao Yun said.</p><p>&#x201C;Too wordy,&#x201D; Bao said.</p><p>&#x201C;The Dao of Winds?&#x201D; Wang Tian offered.</p><p>Sunan and Bao looked at each other, then shook their heads.</p><p>&#x201C;The Wind Sabre,&#x201D; Sunan said.</p><p>Bao smiled. &#x201C;I like it.&#x201D;</p><p>**</p><p>Over the course of the past month, the True Shan had sent no word regarding the dream. Now that the Wind Sabre was complete, Sunan and Bao inquired of the tribe elders, and were informed that they could leave.</p><p>The same young woman who had led them to the tribe brought the news. &#x201C;If the True Shan wish it, they will contact you,&#x201D; she said. &#x201C;Now, if you&#x2019;re ready to go, I&#x2019;ll lead you back to the river.&#x201D;</p><p>And thus began their return to the western Banyan Region.</p><p>Pushing the raft upstream with poles was still faster than traveling on foot. Days flowed by, and eventually they disembarked and began to head on foot back toward the Chrysanthemum Lake. As time continued to pass, the little cloth bracelet Sunan had tucked away in his robe started to seem heavier and heavier.</p><p>They were noticed by a Dragon Phoenix Sect patrol when they were about a day from the camp.</p><p>&#x201C;Dragon Sovereign Sunan! Phoenix Sovereign Bao! Greetings!&#x201D; The disciples who met them excitedly went on to explain that the new sect headquarters was complete, and that the sect was merely waiting for their return before moving to Zun Shan.</p><p>They hurried back to the temporary camp as quickly as possible.</p><p>Upon arriving, they were received by Sun Mai and leaders of the sect. Everyone was in high spirits, and also itching to move to the new sect headquarters.</p><p>&#x201C;I&#x2019;ve been there myself,&#x201D; Sun Mai said. &#x201C;It&#x2019;s a grand sight to be sure. However, considering you&#x2019;ve been gone for so long, a feast is in order. Tonight we dine and drink, and worry about Zun Shan tomorrow.&#x201D;</p><p>Just when the festivities were beginning, a guard hurried over to Bao and Sunan. &#x201C;Dragon Sovereign Sunan, Phoenix Sovereign Bao, a visitor has arrived and seeks an audience.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Who is it?&#x201D; Bao asked.</p><p>&#x201C;A young lady surnamed Ping. She says she brings a message from the Timeless Master!&#x201D;</p><p>--</p><p>We have to take a very short break from providing extra material.
