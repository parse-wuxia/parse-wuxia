<p><strong>Chapter 92: A Bear In A Cave</strong></p><p>&#x201C;What!?&#x201D; Wang Tian blurted.</p><p>Tie Gangwen&#x2019;s eyes went wide, and even Mao Yun seemed completely taken aback.</p><p>&#x201C;In some ways,&#x201D; Li Runfa said, &#x201C;it&#x2019;s a complicated story, and in other ways, very simple. Haven&#x2019;t you ever wondered why I never devoted myself to studying martial arts? It is because I was focused on other matters. To explain, I have to go all the way back to when we were fleeing north, and stopped in Tung-on. When browsing through the back alley shops there, I found an ancient text which described a ritual of incredible&#x2026;.&#x201D; After trailing off for a short moment, he continued, &#x201C;perhaps not power, but usefulness.</p><p>&#x201C;One of the key ingredients to complete the ritual was the blood of a Raksha Demon. Raksha Demons are terrifyingly ferocious things, and as you can imagine, getting the blood of one was no easy task. Mao Yun, do you remember the three Zhou brothers?&#x201D;</p><p>Mao Yun nodded.</p><p>&#x201C;The four of us teamed up, and after many years of plotting and planning, we managed to track down a young Raksha Demon and kill it. Sadly, First Zhou and Second Zhou were killed in the battle. Later, Third Zhou and I used the blood of the Raksha Demon to complete the ritual, and make these.&#x201D; Reaching into his sleeve, he pulled out what appeared to a mask made of leather, or&#x2026; skin. Without any further explanation, he placed the mask onto face, whereupon his facial features suddenly blurred. Moments later, they became clear again. As of that moment, Li Runfa didn&#x2019;t look at all like Li Runfa, but rather the spitting image of Sunan. He even looked physically larger than he had before. Even more shocking was that everyone present, despite being Profound Masters with incredible senses, and also the ability to detect and analyze auras, couldn&#x2019;t tell any difference between Li Runfa&#x2019;s Qi fluctuations and Sunan&#x2019;s.</p><p>&#x201C;Apparently,&#x201D; he continued, his voice now that of Sunan&#x2019;s, &#x201C;the changes go down into the muscles, bones, and even blood.&#x201D;</p><p>Then he peeled the mask off of his face, whereupon his features returned to normal. &#x201C;The masks come with other&#x2026; benefits as well. I realized immediately that with tools like this at my disposal, I could build the ultimate intelligence agency, which is exactly what I did. With the blessing of the Dragon Sovereign and Phoenix Sovereign, the Raksha Division was born. Third Zhou and I began to recruit, picking the best of the best from our sect, and also bringing in fresh blood.&#x201D; He looked over at Wang Tian with an enigmatic smile. &#x201C;We even have a few former Eyes of the Phoenix.&#x201D;</p><p>Wang Tian frowned slightly, apparently neither amused nor pleased by this new information.</p><p>Li Runfa didn&#x2019;t seem fazed by Wang Tian&#x2019;s reaction. &#x201C;Unfortunately, we only have a few masks, and have been unable to track down any more Raksha Demons in the years since. Therefore, we are few in number. However, over the years we have infiltrated many of the most powerful organizations in the empire, and have gained access to some of the most secret locations. That includes Yao Gong palace.&#x201D;</p><p>At this point, Bao couldn&#x2019;t help but ask, &#x201C;You have an agent inside of Yao Gong palace?&#x201D;</p><p>Even she had not been made aware of this point.</p><p>&#x201C;Yes,&#x201D; Li Runfa said. &#x201C;It was a very difficult task, but Third Zhou himself managed to take the place of one of the palace servants, which was how he managed to make this.&#x201D; Li Runfa pulled a leather tube out of his robe, which he opened. Within it was a patch of animal skin rolled around a weathered piece of paper. As he unrolled the animal skin out in front of the gathered group, it quickly became obvious what it was.</p><p>&#x201C;Is that a map?&#x201D; Mao Yun asked. &#x201C;Of Yao Gong palace?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Indeed,&#x201D; Li Runfa replied. &#x201C;And this--&#x201D; he unrolled the paper, &#x201C;is detailed information about everything from the guard patrols, to the meal schedule, to the times and places when the Demon Emperor appears in the open for ceremonies and the like.&#x201D;</p><p>Tie Gangwen shook his head. &#x201C;Master Li, if your Raksha Division can get a map of the Demon Emperor&#x2019;s palace, and even a schedule of his daily affairs, what other things might you have been able to do throughout the years to help us? How many times did we sent men to infiltrate the enemy, only for them to be discovered and executed? Those masks could have been of incredible use!&#x201D;</p><p>Li Runfa looked back at him with a sharp glint in his eyes. &#x201C;Do you really think our division didn&#x2019;t help on missions throughout the years? During the most important operations, there was always a Raksha agent helping from the shadows. How do you think we were able to steal the Zhizhu Coral so easily? Or what about the assassination of the Chief Shaman? Or the Uprising of Nansun? None of them would have been possible without the Raksha Division.</p><p>&#x201C;Think of all the intelligence I have brought to the table of the years, maps and schedules just like the ones in front of you. Do you really think our ordinary intelligence wing could have access to so much dangerous, secret information? You never asked how I got such information, and I never offered to reveal my sources, an arrangement I don&#x2019;t think anyone in the sect found fault with.</p><p>&#x201C;The Raksha Division was the most powerful tool at the disposal of the Dragon-Phoenix Sect, a trump card that I was not willing to reveal until the time came to strike the final blow.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;And that time is now,&#x201D; Sunan said. &#x201C;Master Li, I presume you&#x2019;ve studied the map and the schedule already, and have identified some ideal places and times to consider?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Yes. However, now that the secret of the Raksha Division has been revealed, I have another bit of information that I must share. Before I do, please allow me to preface my words by saying that I fully believe in this plan to eliminate the Demon Emperor once and for all. The Profound Masters of the Dragon-Phoenix Sect are the most powerful warriors in the world, and if steps are not taken to end the Demon Emperor now, I fear the world will be lost for all time.</p><p>&#x201C;However, perhaps better than anyone else here, I understand how powerful the Demon Emperor is. And that is because a Raksha agent was in the Grotto of the Timeless Master when it fell.&#x201D;</p><p>All eyes had already been on Li Runfa before, but now they were even more sharply focused on him.</p><p>&#x201C;According to the stories which have begun to spread since the fall of the Timeless Master, he was killed during a decisive duel with Bone General Geng. However, the truth is much more chilling. The Bone General and the Timeless Master didn&#x2019;t fight until the very end of the battle, when most everyone else in the grotto had been slaughtered. The Timeless Master defeated the Bone General easily, but didn&#x2019;t manage to kill him. And yet, the Timeless Master was not fated to survive. The Demon Emperor himself returned to finish the job.</p><p>&#x201C;My Raksha agent was there, hidden, to witness the entire tragic spectacle. After the dust settled, she escape and recorded this.&#x201D; He pulled out a many-folded piece of paper which he put down in front of him. &#x201C;Names and descriptions of some of the techniques the Demon Emperor used, as well as a brief account of the final moments of the Timeless Master.&#x201D;</p><p>As Sunan reached out to pick up the piece of paper, Li Runfa shook his head and continued, &#x201C;The Demon Emperor is terrifyingly powerful, that much is certain. Were it not for some immensely powerful magical weapons the Timeless Master had at his disposal, objects none of us were aware that he possessed, he would never have lasted for even a single round of combat. He also had a powerful protector, someone the Demon Emperor called a Sertori, although I&#x2019;m not sure what that means.&#x201D;</p><p>Sunan unfolded the piece of paper and began to read it. &#x201C;Some of these techniques seem familiar,&#x201D; he said, &#x201C;things I&#x2019;ve seen used by Demon Emperor soldiers, such as Dancing Steel. But Vortegan&#x2019;s Whirling Catastrophe? How bizarre. What does <em>vortegan</em> mean anyway?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Likely a transliteration,&#x201D; Bao said. &#x201C;Not surprising considering the Demon Emperor is from another realm.&#x201D;</p><p>Sun Mai&#x2019;s eyes sparkled. &#x201C;Another realm?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Another realm. Another world? Call it whatever you wish to call it.&#x201D; She sighed. &#x201C;I almost can&#x2019;t believe that in the end, the Demon Emperor really did kill his own son.&#x201D;</p><p>Li Runfa&#x2019;s eyes widened. &#x201C;You knew that the Timeless Master was the son of the Demon Emperor? My Raksha agent reported that the Demon Emperor said as much in the final moments of their fight, but even I wasn&#x2019;t sure if that information was accurate.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;We&#x2019;ve known for many years,&#x201D; Bao replied. &#x201C;What a tragic end to the story of Li Buwei.&#x201D;</p><p>Before Sun Mai or any of the others could ask any of the questions which were burning in their minds, Sunan said, &#x201C;Listen to this.&#x201D; Then he began to read from the slip of paper that was the report from Li Runfa&#x2019;s Raksha agent. &#x201C;<em>The Timeless Master struck blow after blow. However, neither the edge of his blade nor the power of his Qi could harm the Demon Emperor. Any wounds which were inflicted would heal before a second blow could be struck. He was essentially impervious to attack.</em>&#x201D;</p><p>When Sunan finished speaking, silence filled the room. A long moment passed, then Sunan looked up at Sun Mai, &#x201C;Is this why you insist on sealing him and not killing him?&#x201D;</p><p>Sun Mai didn&#x2019;t respond at first. After rubbing his chin in thought for a moment, he nodded. &#x201C;Truth be told I was not aware of this particular detail, but it makes sense given what I do know. If an ordinary man had a bear to deal with, it would be much wiser to seal the mouth of its cave with a boulder than to try to slit the beast&#x2019;s throat with a knife.&#x201D;</p><p>Bao gritted her teeth. &#x201C;The oath I swore was to see him dead!&#x201D;</p><p>Sunan reached out and placed his hand on Bao&#x2019;s knee. &#x201C;Seal the bear in its cave, and it will starve to death. Or at least, there it will be trapped until you can collapse the cave itself.&#x201D;</p><p>Another long moment passed, and Bao nodded. &#x201C;I agree. Li Runfa, explain the times and places you&#x2019;ve identified as the best options to unleash the spell formation.&#x201D;</p>
