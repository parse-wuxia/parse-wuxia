<p><strong>Chapter 235 - Divine Feathers Sect</strong></p><p>&#x201C;Impolite? Haha, Young master Tian Ling, what did we just hear? These two ladies are actually saying that they&#x2019;ll be impolite to us!&#x201D; Wu Yu laughed heartily, but his laughter gradually turned sinister and a chilling light flashed across his eyes.</p><p>Tian Ling snorted and said, &#x201C;If you two ladies are willing to come with us, then we definitely won&#x2019;t make things difficult for the you. However, if you refuse our toast and have to be forcibly persuaded, then don&#x2019;t blame us for our actions!&#x201D;</p><p>Tian Ling emitted a powerful oppressive aura towards Ye Ziyun and Xiao Ning&#x2019;er.</p><p>&#x201C;Ye Ziyun, we still have the scroll that Xiao Yu gave us. If that doesn&#x2019;t work, then I&#x2019;ll stall them while you escape!&#x201D; Xiao Ning&#x2019;er said to Ye Ziyun in a low voice as her eyes flashed with a faint sadness.</p><p>If Ye Ziyun died, Nie Li would definitely be heartbroken. Therefore, she has to guarantee Ye Ziyun&#x2019;s safety. But if Xiao Ning&#x2019;er somehow got herself killed in the process, would Nie Li be heartbroken over her?</p><p>&#x201C;Ning&#x2019;er, if the two of us are going to escape, then we&#x2019;ll do it together. If we both manage to survive, I hope that we can return to being sisters, like in our childhood days!&#x201D; Ye Ziyun&#x2019;s eyes flashed with a hint of tears. To think that during this situation, Ning&#x2019;er&#x2019;s first reaction was to let her leave first!</p><p>Xiao Ning&#x2019;er looked at Ye Ziyun as memories of the past spun through her head. Once upon a time, the two of them were as close as sisters. But for certain reasons, the two of them gradually grew apart. When she heard Ye Ziyun&#x2019;s words, Xiao Ning&#x2019;er&#x2019;s heart ached and she kept silent. However, she had already approved of Ye Ziyun&#x2019;s request.</p><p>&#x201C;Are you done with your discussion? We don&#x2019;t have that much patience in waiting!&#x201D; Wu Yu barked with a menacing expression. He feared that Nie Li would appear again.</p><p>The group slowly closed in on Ye Ziyun and Xiao Ning&#x2019;er.</p><p>Although they could sense Tian Ling&#x2019;s terrifying aura oppressing them, Ye Ziyun and Xiao Ning&#x2019;er still appeared to be very calm. The two of them were prideful women and had been through all kinds of situations since they were young.</p><p>Xiao Ning&#x2019;er watched as they slowly got closer. She showed a dark and cold smile at Wu Yu, Tian Ling and the rest, took out the golden scroll that Xiao Yu had given them, and held it in front of her.</p><p>&#x201C;Do you know what is this?&#x201D; Xiao Ning&#x2019;er coldly snapped. Her palms were drenched in sweat. If Xiao Yu had given them a useless item, they would definitely be in trouble.</p><p>&#x201C;Hahaha, you thought that you&#x2019;d be able to deal with all of us with just a scroll?&#x201D; Wu Yu let out a loud laugh. These two ladies from the human race were too silly.</p><p>As Wu Yu was laughing, Tian Ling hit Wu Yu over the head and his laughter stopped.</p><p>&#x201C;Disgraceful fool, take a closer look at it!&#x201D; Tian Ling cursed in a solemn voice.</p><p>At Tian Ling&#x2019;s words, Wu Yu was dazed for a moment, then took a closer look at the item in Xiao Ning&#x2019;er&#x2019;s hands. His face immediately changed and eyes portrayed a deep fear as he swallowed a mouthful of saliva. In his mind, he began cursing Ye Han to death. If only Ye Hand didn&#x2019;t provoke such trouble...</p><p>&#x201C;Two respected ladies, had you shown us this earlier, we wouldn&#x2019;t have dared to offend you as such. I represent my family and express our sincerest apologies. If the two ladies are still not appeased, I am fully willing to offer my head to seek your forgiveness.&#x201D; Tian Ling lowered his head, his earlier arrogance gone without a trace, replaced by an expression of pure fear and respect.</p><p>Wu Yu also lowered his head as he recalled a terrifying legend. A chill went down his backbone.</p><p>Ten years ago, a powerful family in the Nether Realm offended someone with a golden scroll in their hands. The entire family was exterminated without a single survivor. It&#x2019;s said that there were servants of the Master of the Nether Realm among the experts sent to exterminate the family.</p><p>Three years ago, another youth went around bluffing with a golden scroll and his family was also annihilated without any survivors.</p><p>Since then, the pattern on the golden scroll has been written into textbooks, to be memorised by everyone from every family! No one wished to have their family destroyed.</p><p>Thereafter, that golden scroll no longer appeared. However, they never expected it to show itself again in the hands of Ye Ziyun and Xiao Ning&#x2019;er!</p><p>Although Tian Ling and the rest were usually very arrogant, they still understood that there were some people in the Nether Realm that they should never offend. Especially those who were close to the Master of the Nether Realm.</p><p>Tian Ling and Wu Yu lowered their heads, while the others became very frightened. No one dared to speak a word.</p><p>As they recalled the meaning behind that golden scroll, they understood that even a slightly careless mistake could bring complete destruction upon their family.</p><p>Xiao Ning&#x2019;er and Ye Ziyun were both stunned. They never imagined that the golden scroll in their hands would have so much influence that it would frighten Tian Ling, Wu Yu and the rest into utter submission. The two of them exchanged a glance. They were both extremely smart and intelligent, yet how could they not notice that Xiao Yu definitely had hidden and shocking origins?! Whoever he was, his background was not something that even Tian Ling and the others could easily offend.</p><p>&#x201C;Get lost. Don&#x2019;t let us see you again.&#x201D; Xiao Ning&#x2019;er coldly glared at them.</p><p>Tian Ling and Wu Yu both glanced at each other. They never thought that Ye Ziyun and Xiao Ning&#x2019;er would let them go so easily. Therefore, they swiftly made their exits.</p><p>In an instant, Tian Ling and Wu Yu had disappeared into the distant forest.</p><p>&#x201C;Young Master Tian Ling, I still feel that this matter is a little suspicious. Could those two girls have used a fake to scare us?&#x201D; Wu Yu said with his brows furrowed.</p><p>Tian Ling glanced at Wu Yu and coldly said, &#x201C;Then, do you want to go back? Using a fake scroll would have their families exterminated! Who else would dare to do so?&#x201D; Even if it&#x2019;s a fake, they could only suck it up. Luckily they did not offend those two girls too badly; otherwise, it could have really summoned a crisis upon their family!</p><p>&#x201C;What could the identities of those two girls be?&#x201D; he wondered.</p><p>When they saw Tian Ling and Wu Yu disappear into the forest, Ye Ziyun and Xiao Ning&#x2019;er both let out heavy sighs of relief. The two of them glanced at each other and smiled from being relieved of their burden. Earlier, if it hadn&#x2019;t been for Xiao Yu&#x2019;s golden scroll, the situation could&#x2019;ve gotten dangerous. After experiencing the danger together, the obstruction between Ye Ziyun and Xiao Ning&#x2019;er became shallower, no longer as deep as it once was.</p><p>The two of them couldn&#x2019;t help looking in the direction of the tomb as they wondered how Nie Li and Xiao Yu were currently faring.</p><p>Within the tomb</p><p>Nie Li and Xiao Yu sat on the shore, having a conversation. Their entire bodies were still soaking wet. Nie Li removed his clothes quickly as he put on a new set.</p><p>&#x201C;You&#x2019;re not changing?&#x201D; Nie Li asked Xiao Yu in curiosity.</p><p>While Nie Li was changing his clothes, Xiao Yu turned his head away. He replied to Nie Li with his back towards him as white steam rose from his body, his clothes quickly drying, &#x201C;I don&#x2019;t need to change for the time being.&#x201D;</p><p>This guy was really strange. He&#x2019;s usually so mysophobic, but now he&#x2019;s not willing to change his dirty clothes. Could it be that he didn&#x2019;t have anymore spare clothes in his interspatial ring?</p><p>However, Nie Li couldn&#x2019;t be bothered by such small things.</p><p>Xiao Yu recalled how easily Nie Li had managed to break the inscription patterns on the ancient tomb&#x2019;s door. Nie Li&#x2019;s comprehension of inscription patterns should&#x2019;ve reached an astonishing degree.</p><p>&#x201C;I heard that the Master of the Nether Realm is currently recruiting disciples, especially talented younger generations. If they&#x2019;re exceptionally extraordinary, they can even be sent to a place called the Divine Feathers Sect to cultivate. I wonder if brother Nie Li is interested?&#x201D; Xiao Yu said as he lightly smiled.</p><p>&#x201C;Divine Feathers Sect?&#x201D;&#x201D; At Xiao Yu&#x2019;s words, a light of recognition abruptly flashed across Nie Li&#x2019;s eyes. That was a powerful location in the Draconic Ruins Realm. Indeed, the people of this world already knew how to reach the Draconic Ruins Realm and had already made connections with the people on that side!</p><p>Even within the Draconic Ruins Realm, the Divine Feathers Sect was considered an extremely powerful sect. Nie Li sunk deeper into his memories. Speaking of which, he, himself had been a little involved with the Master of Divine Feathers Sect. He momentarily wondered what the current situation in the Divine Feathers Sect was.</p><p>In the Divine Continent, Legend and Demigod ranks could already be considered powerful existences. However, in that domain, experts were further split into five realms:</p><p>Heavenly Fate, Heavenly Star, Heavenly Axis, Dao of the Dragon, and Martial Ancestor. Each realm was also subdivided into smaller realms. Spiritual Gods of the Nether Realm were equivalent to 1-fate, 2-fate, or even 3-fate Heavenly Fate ranks of that world.</p><p>&#x201C;Brother Nie Li knows of the Divine Feathers Sect?&#x201D; Seeing Nie Li&#x2019;s strange reaction, Xiao Yu&#x2019;s brows slightly twitched.</p><p>&#x201C;I don&#x2019;t. Aha, what kind of place is the Divine Feathers Sect?&#x201D; Now that he knew the Master of the Nether Realm could contact the Divine Feathers Sect, Nie Li was extremely shocked.</p><p>Looking at Nie Li, Xiao Yu sighed a breath of relief in his heart. It would be strange if Nie Lie knew about the existence of the Divine Feathers Sect, since it&#x2019;s a powerful sect that belongs to a whole different world!</p><p>Xiao Yu sighed, &#x201C;Regardless of what kind of place the Divine Feathers Sect is, you only have to know that it exists and that it is an amazing place. Even Spiritual God rank experts are only considered ordinary in a sect as large and powerful as that.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Oh? Then I&#x2019;ll really have to take a look!&#x201D; Nie Li pretended to be very interested. If he managed to become the disciple of the Master of the Nether Realm, he might able to enter the Divine Feathers Sect of the Draconic Ruins Realm. That would certainly be fast and easy access.</p><p>Xiao Yu proudly said, &#x201C;In fact, the people over there refer to our world as the Tiny World. It&#x2019;s simply incomparable to the world in the Draconic Ruins Realm. In the world of the Divine Feathers Sect, there&#x2019;re countless other sects and supreme experts. The cultivating resources over there are also incomparable to our Tiny World.&#x201D;</p><p>Nie Li&#x2019;s heart trembled slightly. It seems that Xiao Yu has been to the Draconic Ruins Realm before.</p><p>In fact, compared to the vast Draconic Ruins Realm, the Divine Continent was simply too small.</p><p>He wondered just what kind of position the Master of the Nether Realm has over in the Divine Feathers Sect and what relation Xiao Yu has with the Master of the Nether Realm.</p><p>&#x201C;So, you&#x2019;re interested in becoming the disciple of the Master of the Nether Realm?&#x2019; Xiao Yu smiled as he asked Nie Li.</p><p>Nie Li pondered for a while and lightly said, &#x201C;I&#x2019;ll look at the situation first, then think it over.&#x201D;</p><p>At Nie Li&#x2019;s words, Xiao Yu said in an irritated tone, &#x201C;Do you have any idea just how many people want to become disciples of the Master of the Nether Realm?&#x2019;</p><p>&#x201C;What does that got to do with me?&#x201D; Nie Li glanced at Xiao Yu.</p><p>&#x201C;That...&#x201D; Xiao Yu was speechless.</p><p></p><hr><p></p>
