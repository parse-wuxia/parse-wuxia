<p><strong>Chapter 240 - Demon Lord</strong></p><p>Very swiftly, the news spread among the various families gathered at the entrance of the Nine-Layered Deathlands.</p><p>The Wugui Family had offended a powerful figure and was currently surrounded by representatives of many powerful families of Nether City. Even the Patriarch of the Wugui Family, Wu Hun, had been captured. After this news spread, all the other families were shocked. Just which powerful figure was able to make so many powerful families obey his orders?</p><p>Aside from that matter, rumors claimed that these powerful families had also paid a trip to the Dark Guild. According to the rumors, they also planned to capture the members of the Dark Guild; however, the Dark Guild had disappeared and were nowhere to be found. The Demigod rank experts searched long and hard, but eventually gave up. However, the Dark Guild members have been listed as wanted people.</p><p>First layer of the Nine-Layered Deathlands.</p><p>Just as Nie Li, Ye Ziyun, and Xiao Ning&#x2019;er were walking along, Yu Yan flew over and landed on Nie Li&#x2019;s shoulder.</p><p>Nie Li glanced at Yu Yan, who was sitting on his shoulders, and asked, &#x201C;Sister Yu Yan, where were you earlier?&#x201D;</p><p>A hint of sadness smeared the center of Yu Yan&#x2019;s brow as she said, &#x201C;Long ago, the Nine-Layered Deathlands was a battlefield between the demon clan and the human race. During that time, many human corpses ended up here. I searched for them by tracing their auras and had them buried.&#x201D;</p><p>At Yu Yan&#x2019;s words, Ye Ziyun and Xiao Ning&#x2019;er both showed traces of sadness on their faces.</p><p>&#x201C;However, I also found this item,&#x201D; Yu Yan continued, as she didn&#x2019;t want to bring down mood of everyone. She took out a simple, unadorned mirror.</p><p>&#x201C;What is this?&#x201D; Ye Ziyun asked in doubt.</p><p>Xiao Ning&#x2019;er&#x2019;s also gave a curious look at the mirror.</p><p>&#x201C;This is&#x2026;!&#x201D; Nie Li&#x2019;s brows twitched as he said in shock. He never thought that in the trip that Yu Yan took, she would actually bring back such a shocking item.</p><p>&#x201C;It seems that Nie Li also knows of this item. This is a soul mirror that can suck out the soul of a person and maintain the state of that soul without dispersing it.&#x201D; Yu Yan introduced.</p><p>What Yu Yan said was correct. However, this was only a portion of the mirror&#x2019;s power. There are many other uses to it! Some uses would require him to reach the Heavenly Fate Realm before he&#x2019;s able to use it.</p><p>Yu Yan passed the soul mirror over to Nie Li and said, &#x201C;I don&#x2019;t have a use for this. You should keep it.&#x201D;</p><p>Nie Li nodded his head. Even Yu Yan didn&#x2019;t know about the true uses of the soul mirror. In fact, only Nie Li was capable of wielding the mirror to its full potential. Nie Li kept the mirror and passed the scarlet gem, which Xiao Yu had obtained from the Zombie Jiao-dragon, over to Xiao Ning&#x2019;er.</p><p>Xiao Ning&#x2019;er&#x2019;s face flushed red as she raised her head. She glanced at Nie Li as she quietly received the scarlet gem. This was a gift from Nie Li to her!</p><p>If Xiao Yu was present and aware of Xiao Ning&#x2019;er&#x2019;s current thoughts, he would probably be depressed to the point that he would vomit blood. This was obviously something that Xiao Yu had given to her first! But now, in her eyes, it had become something that Nie Li gave to her.</p><p>&#x201C;Let&#x2019;s search for Du Ze and the others!&#x201D; Nie Li smiled as the four of them walked on.</p><p>In another corner of the Nine-Layered Deathlands</p><p>A few people were gathered together, crowding around a twenty-something year old youth. This youth had a handsome, oval-shaped face. This seemingly charming face of his was ghastly pale with bloodshot eyes that would cause people to be absolutely horrified upon seeing him, and they would tremble from fear.</p><p>This person was emitting a frosty cold aura from his entire body, which caused the surrounding temperature to plunge.</p><p>Next him stood two men, Long Sha and Gui Sha who had launched the sneak attack against Glory City a while back.</p><p>&#x201C;Demon Lord, what should we do now? The powerful families of Nether City aren&#x2019;t a force that we can deal with!&#x201D; Long Sha asked anxiously.</p><p>The youth leaked some bloodlust from his eyes as he said, &#x201C;I never expected them to be so capable. To think that they could mobilise those experts from so many powerful families of Nether City. Even the Wugui Family was oppressed.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Demon Lord, you mean to say that all of this was caused by the people from Glory City?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;That youth must have been the one who laid the Ten Thousand Demonic Beast Array.&#x201D; A trace of laughter leaked from the corner of the Demon Lord&#x2019;s mouth as he said, &#x201C;This has aroused my interest. I wonder when I will finally be able to meet him? He will probably participate in the disciple selection of the Master of the Nether Realm; furthermore, his chances of being chosen are very high!&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Demon Lord, aren&#x2019;t you also going to partake in that disciple selection? So you&#x2019;re saying...&#x201D; Long Sha&#x2019;s eyes lit up as he understood something.</p><p>&#x201C;Certainly, as long as I passed the selection, I will be able to enter the Divine Feathers Sect. Previously, my physical body was too weak; but now I have this body with the Supreme Physique that appears only once every ten thousand years. Even without the Heavenly Energy, I&#x2019;m already about to achieve a Fate Star. If the Master of the Nether Realm isn&#x2019;t a blind idiot, he&#x2019;ll definitely choose me.&#x201D; The Demon Lord laughed, &#x201C;I don&#x2019;t believe that that person would be able to find a body that&#x2019;s better than my Supreme Physique!&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;No matter how wonderful that person&#x2019;s body is, how could it compare to Demon Lord&#x2019;s Supreme Physique?&#x201D; Long Sha said with respect, while Gui Sha nodded from the sidelines in agreement.</p><p>&#x201C;While I&#x2019;m absent, you guys are to conceal yourselves and not show yourselves. Even joining the other families for the time being is also acceptable.&#x201D; The Demon Lord said calmly.</p><p>&#x201C;Yes, we will await your return, Demon Lord!&#x201D; Long Sha and the rest said with respect.</p><p>The Demon Lord raised his head as he looked into the distance. Finally, in this life, he has the qualifications to enter the Divine Feathers Sect. Just what kind of person was that mysterious youth? With him as an opponent, he probably won&#x2019;t be lonely on this trip. His mouth curled into a small smile, filled with interest.</p><p>The Demon Lord moved forward, step by step, and gradually drew further away.</p><p>As he watched the Demon Lord&#x2019;s retreating back, Long Sha and the others knelt towards the Demon Lord&#x2019;s direction, each showing determination in their eyes.</p><p>&#x201C;We shall serve the Lord with our lives and wait for the Lord&#x2019;s honorable return!&#x201D;</p><p>Henceforth, the Dark Guild disappeared from Nether City. However, regardless, even until the end of the time, they will await the Demon Lord&#x2019;s return with unwavering loyalty, until the day he leads them again!</p><p>Nie Li and his group continued to search along the first layer of the Nine-Layered Deathlands. Finally, two days later, they found Du Ze and the others. Summed up, they had obtained eleven Spiritual Origin Fruits. For those whom had yet to step into Legend rank, these items were of the absolute highest quality!</p><p>Gathering all their Spiritual Origin Fruits, they returned to the Jade Seal Family&#x2019;s camp.</p><p>When he learned that Nie Li and the rest had returned safely, Luo Xiao and the others finally felt at ease. After all, right now, Nie Li was way too important for the Jade Seal Family.</p><p>Nie Li and his group took a Spiritual Origin Fruit each and returned to their own tents to refine their cultivation. The seventh layer of the Nine-Layered Deathlands would soon open; therefore, they have to raise their strength as fast as possible!</p><p>Nie Li sat cross-legged and ate his Spiritual Origin Fruit. A warm current circulated all the way down to his throat and entered his abdomen before it spread through his meridians.</p><p>The medicinal energy of the Spiritual Origin Fruit was very pure, it was steadily nourishing Nie Li&#x2019;s soul realm.</p><p>*Boom!* *Boom!* *Boom!*</p><p>Nie Li&#x2019;s soul realm continuously expanded.</p><p>Previously, when he had comprehended the Law of Death, Nie Li&#x2019;s cultivation had begun to show signs of a breakthrough, except that he still hadn&#x2019;t been able to rank up. Now that he had consumed a Spiritual Origin Fruit and controlled three Law Energies, the energy in his body continuously surged. His cultivation rose accordingly and rose all the way to 5-star Black Gold rank before stopping.</p><p>Theoretically, with the help from Duan Jian&#x2019;s soul realm and the three Law Energies, Nie Li&#x2019;s strength should&#x2019;ve been able to break through all the way to Legend rank. However, because he is using the [Heavenly God] cultivation technique, Nie Li is having a much harder time reaching 5-star Black Gold rank, compared to Ye Ziyun, Xiao Ning&#x2019;er, Du Ze, and the others. Therefore, his cultivation has stopped at the gate to Legend rank.</p><p>Within his soul realm, Nie Li could sense that aside from him, the others had experienced leaps and bounds in their cultivation, and were beginning to break into Legend rank.</p><p>By practicing the cultivation techniques that Nie Li had given them and adding the incantation from the Soul Array, they would all be able to step into Legend rank before long. If one person among them managed to become the disciple of the Master of the Nether Realm, then Glory City would be absolutely safe from then on.</p><p>Time continued to flow as he quietly cultivated.</p><p>As Nie Li was concentrating on his cultivation, he suddenly sensed something and opened his eyes.</p><p>He walked to the entrance of his tent and lifted the curtain. Raising his head, he saw Xiao Ning&#x2019;er standing outside showing a red face that went all the way down to her neck. He had no idea as to what she was thinking about. She appeared even more charming than before, and in her hands, she held a tray with a steaming bowl of soup.</p><p>&#x201C;Ning&#x2019;er, what are you doing here?&#x201D; Nie Li asked.</p><p>Nie Li&#x2019;s sudden appearance and voice gave Ning&#x2019;er a scare. The tray in her hands became unstable and fell on the floor, pouring the soup everywhere.</p><p>&#x201C;No, it&#x2019;s nothing.&#x201D; Ning&#x2019;er said nervously as she clumsily began to tidy things up. Her face turned even redder as her chest constantly puffed up and down.</p><p>The soup had poured all over Ning&#x2019;er clothes. Nie Li immediately helped her pick up the tray, then he looked at her with a puzzled expression. He didn&#x2019;t understand what was wrong with Ning&#x2019;er and noticed that her expression was a little weird.</p><p>She was only wearing thin silk clothes and looked charmingly tempting in her pureness. When the soup poured on her, it caused her thin clothes to stick to her skin and vaguely revealed her pearly white skin and the pale pink chest wrap that couldn&#x2019;t fully cover the impressive cleavage. It was a kind of indescribable temptation.</p><p>Seeing such a timid and charming Ning&#x2019;er, Nie Li didn&#x2019;t know what to say.</p><p>&#x201C;Are you alright? Go back and quickly get changed.&#x201D; Nie Li said a little awkwardly.</p><p>Lowering her head and looking at herself, Xiao Ning&#x2019;er let out a little scream as she quickly covered her chest with the tray. She spoke with her head lowered, &#x201C;Then I&#x2019;ll go back first!&#x201D;</p><p>As soon as the words were out of her mouth, she quickly left with her head down.</p><p>Staring after Xiao Ning&#x2019;er&#x2019;s back, Nie Li made a puzzled expression on his face. Why did he feel that there was something not right with Ning&#x2019;er today? He thought over and over again, but still couldn&#x2019;t figure it out; therefore, he could only let it go as he turned around and went back into his tent.</p><p>Returning to her own tent, Xiao Ning&#x2019;er&#x2019;s cheeks felt like they were boiling as she glanced at the tray in her hands. Her heart was still beating like a rabbit that was jumping about. Why did she wear such a thin chest wrap? Nie Li wouldn&#x2019;t misunderstand and think of her as one of those easy girls, right?! She stomped her feet. This was all Xiao Xue&#x2019;s rotten idea, which caused her to show an embarrassing side in front of Nie Li!</p><p></p><hr><p></p>
