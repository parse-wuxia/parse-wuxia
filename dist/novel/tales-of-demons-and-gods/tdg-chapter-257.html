<p><strong>Chapter 257 - Enemy Attack?</strong></p><p>Because she had exhausted her soul force, Xiao Ning&#x2019;er&#x2019;s entire body felt weak without an ounce of strength left. Her beautiful face was drenched in sweat and she looked a little pale.</p><p>At the same time, Nie Li felt as though he was experiencing a long dream. Within the dream, he watched his family, lover, and friends die one by one as he helplessly stood by. Then, once he had obtained a method to revive them, the Sage Emperor proceeded to extinguish all his hopes. In the end, he was left all alone to die a bitter death.</p><p>Because of the mysterious Temporal Demon Spirit Book, he was resurrected and was given a second chance.</p><p>However, the cause of all these events, the Temporal Demon Spirit book, was now missing.</p><p>As he thought about it, Nie Li felt his head ache even more. He couldn&#x2019;t understand what was going on.</p><p>He dreamed that just as he was about to grab the Temporal Demon Spirit Book, it turned into a streak of light and disappeared into the vast sky.</p><p>The Temporal Demon Spirit Book was the fundamental cause of everything that currently existed. Could it be that when he came back to life, he was resurrected into a different timeline, one that didn&#x2019;t contain the existence of the Temporal Demon Spirit Book?</p><p>The intense pain in his head slowly caused him to regain consciousness. As he opened his eyes, he saw Xiao Ning&#x2019;er sobbing by his bedside. She wore a pink dress and had tear stains on her face, showing quite a pitiful sight. Down from her pearly white neck was her delicate and jade-like collarbone.</p><p>&#x201C;Cough, cough.&#x201D; Nie Li coughed in embarrassment as he immediately shifted his gaze elsewhere.</p><p>Xiao Ning&#x2019;er, who has been crying with her head down, suddenly sat up stunned. She immediately raised her head as joy flashed through her eyes. She looked at Nie Li dumbfoundedly for a moment and then pounced on him.</p><p>&#x201C;Nie Li, you&#x2019;re awake?&#x201D; Xiao Ning&#x2019;er tightly hugged Nie Li. All of this felt like a dream, which scared her. Nie Li had been unconscious for a long time and Xiao Ning&#x2019;er was worried that he would never regain consciousness.</p><p>A fragrance and softness entered Nie Li&#x2019;s embrace. He was stunned for a brief moment as a trace of gentleness flashed through his eyes. Although he didn&#x2019;t know how long he has been out for, he had an idea that it was for a fairly long time, since Xiao Ning&#x2019;er looked like she&#x2019;d almost worried herself to death. He tenderly patted her on the back as the light scent of a lady drifted to him. While he was out, Xiao Ning&#x2019;er must have almost worried herself to death!</p><p>Feeling Nie Li&#x2019;s body warmth, Xiao Ning&#x2019;er was now assured that she wasn&#x2019;t dreaming. The hug left a blush on her face, but she still wasn&#x2019;t willing to let go of him. She sensed that tenderness and felt that at this moment, Nie Li belonged to her.</p><p>Suddenly, two figures rushed into the room.</p><p>At the sight of the two embracing, Xiao Xue immediately turned her head and said, &#x201C;I saw nothing, the two of you should continue.&#x201D;</p><p>Raising his head to looked at Ye Ziyun, Nie Li immediately become a little embarrassed. Just as he was about to explain the situation to her, he noticed the tear streaks on her face. The expression in her eyes wasn&#x2019;t jealousy but a kind of joy, like two people meeting again after so long. She walked towards Nie Li and sat in the chair at the head of the bed.</p><p>As long as Nie Li was alive, nothing else mattered. During the time that Nie Li was out, Ye Ziyun already thought through it all. If he could regain consciousness, she would never fight with Xiao Ning&#x2019;er again. In the face of death, what does the rest matter?</p><p>When he saw Ye Ziyun sit by the bed with a tearful look, Nie Li felt as though his heart was about to melt from her gentle gaze. It could be said that the heavens have granted him grace by letting him meet her again in this life.</p><p>He reached out and took Ye Ziyun into his arms as his eyes filled with tears as well.</p><p>Having experienced all the turmoils of his previous life, the one thing that Nie Li feared the most was that everything he was experiencing now was only a dream. However, now that he beheld the two girls before him, he could assure himself that he was indeed alive in this world.</p><p>Ye Ziyun and Xiao Ning&#x2019;er actually weren&#x2019;t fighting. Xiao Xue stared dumbfoundedly as the gears in her brain stopped turning from shock. However, now that she thought about it, it actually made sense. Indeed, as long as they were alive, nothing was more important. In this turbulent world, no one knew if they would still be living in the next moment. Therefore, the most important thing would be to enjoy the present with the person that&#x2019;s most important.</p><p>At this time, Duan Jian, Lu Piao, Du Ze, and the rest arrived as well. Upon entering the room, their eyes widened when they saw Nie Li being embraced with one beauty on each arm.</p><p>Lu Piao scratched his head. &#x201C;Damn! This bastard Nie Li is really outrageous!&#x201D;</p><p>Those two girls were the goddesses of the Holy Orchid Institute that countless guys have had crushes on! Now both of them were taken by Nie Li. However, now that Lu Piao knew that Nie Li had regained consciousness, he was happy in his heart.</p><p>Du Ze smiled. As long as Nie Li regained consciousness, the rest of them could all rest easy.</p><p>&#x201C;How long have I been out?&#x201D; Nie Li asked Du Ze and the others.</p><p>&#x201C;You&#x2019;ve been out for more than a month.&#x201D; Du Ze seriously replied.</p><p>&#x201C;More than a month?&#x201D; Nie Li was astonished. He knew that he had been out for a long time, but he only thought that it had been two or three days, which by itself would be shocking enough. He never imagined that he would&#x2019;ve been out for more than a month.</p><p>&#x201C;Nie Li, how&#x2019;s your body?&#x201D; Lu Piao asked, feeling a little uneasy. Although he was usually a nitwit, he was still very concerned towards Nie Li.</p><p>Nie Li circulated his Law Energy for a brief moment, then shook his head, &#x201C;Nothing&#x2019;s wrong, my body&#x2019;s fine.&#x201D;</p><p>His body was still the same as it was before. Aside from a vague headache, there weren&#x2019;t any major problems. However, he couldn&#x2019;t figure out why he had been unconsciousness for so long. But no matter how much he thought about it, he couldn&#x2019;t come up with an answer. Now that the Temporal Demon Spirit Book was gone, what should his next step be? It seems like he would have to wait and see after he reaches the Draconic Ruins Realm!</p><p>Nie Li touched his chest. The two remnant pages of the Temporal Demon Spirit Book were still with him. It looks like he will have to wait to unveil the mystery of the Temporal Demon Spirit Book.</p><p>Quickly, the news that Nie Li had awoken spread throughout the City Lord&#x2019;s Mansion.</p><p>When they heard that Nie Li had regained conscious, both Ye Zong and Ye Mo felt relieved. They immediately put down the matters in their hands and rushed to Nie Li&#x2019;s recuperation room.</p><p>With Ye Ziyun and Xiao Ning&#x2019;er&#x2019;s help, Nie Li got out of bed and started to move about as the strength slowly returned to his body.</p><p>Nie Li and the rest walked to the courtyard, where the birds were singing and the fragrances of flowers gave a dense feeling of spring.</p><p>Nie Li pondered for a brief moment, then said, &#x201C;In a short while, we&#x2019;ll have to head for the Draconic Ruins Realm. I have to return to my family and bid farewell.&#x201D;</p><p>Ye Ziyun thought awhile and said, &#x201C;Your body hasn&#x2019;t recovered yet, so it&#x2019;s best if you rest first. Why don&#x2019;t I send someone to bring uncle to the City Lord&#x2019;s Mansion?&#x201D;</p><p>To prevent Nie Li&#x2019;s family members from worrying, they had told them that Nie Li was concentrating on his cultivation. Therefore, Nie Li&#x2019;s family was still unaware that he had been in a coma.</p><p>Nie Li pondered for a moment and nodded his head. &#x201C;Alright then.&#x201D;</p><p>While they were chatting, Ye Zong rushed in. He had been very worried when he heard that Nie Li was in a coma. Although he would often argue with Nie Li, in his heart, Ye Zong had already accepted the boy as his son-in-law.</p><p>Seeing Nie Li still alive and active, a trace of a smile appeared on Ye Zong&#x2019;s face.</p><p>Ye Zong had a serious expression and said, &#x201C;Nie Li, you brat! You&#x2019;ve finally woke up. If you turned my daughter into a widow at such a young age, I&#x2019;d make sure to teach you a sorry lesson.&#x201D;</p><p>At her father&#x2019;s words, Ye Ziyun blushed red and stomped her feet. Nie Li had just regained his conscious not long ago and her father was already speaking of such irrelevant things!</p><p>Nie Li smiled. &#x201C;Thanks for worrying about me, father-in-law. I&#x2019;m already fine.&#x201D; Nie Li had been unconscious for so long, but now that he saw Ye Zong again, he couldn&#x2019;t help feeling a sense of closeness to him. Therefore, Nie Li didn&#x2019;t try to argue with him.</p><p>&#x2018;Why did this kid suddenly become so humble?&#x2019; Wondered Ye Zong. Could it be that after waking from his coma, he became enlightened? He looked at Ye Ziyun, Du Ze and the rest; these kids were now the hope of Glory City. The only thing that made him feel sad was that Nie Li and the rest were about to head for the Draconic Ruins Realm. Although he didn&#x2019;t know what kind of place the Draconic Ruins Realm was, he knew that it should be a very distant place.</p><p>However, if an eaglet does not spread its wings, it will never grow to be a majestic eagle. Old guys like Ye Zong himself should just sit back and let the young&#x2019;uns take flight.</p><p>The atmosphere in that wing of the mansion was very lively as everyone felt joyous and harmonious.</p><p>Both Nie Li and Ye Ziyun were enjoying this meeting. Although Ye Zong still appeared very imposing, when he looked at Nie Li and Ye Ziyun, there was tenderness in his gaze. When he saw how happy his daughter was, he also couldn&#x2019;t help feeling happy.</p><p>Right now, Glory City was far safer than ever before. Even if Nie Li and his group left, with so many Ten Thousand Demonic Beast Arrays and so many Legend rank experts present, they had more than enough force to guarantee the safety of Glory City.</p><p>The sun slowly sank as the curtain of night veiled over.</p><p>&#x201C;Why didn&#x2019;t grandfather come?&#x201D; Ye Ziyun asked, puzzled.</p><p>&#x201C;Yes, he should have received the news!&#x201D; Ye Zong was also a little puzzled. Although Ye Mo was currently cultivating, once he learned that Nie Li had regained consciousness, he should&#x2019;ve rushed over.</p><p>As they conversed, suddenly the sound of an intense fight sounded throughout the City Lord&#x2019;s Mansion.</p><p>*Boom!* *Boom!* *Boom!*</p><p>A few buildings were wrecked.</p><p>&#x201C;What happened?&#x201D; Ye Zong furrowed his brows as he abruptly stood up.</p><p>Nie Li&#x2019;s gaze also carried bewilderment. Just who would dare commit such atrocities in the City Lord&#x2019;s Mansion? Right now, aside from a few Legend rank experts, the City Lord&#x2019;s Mansion was still protect by by the Ten Thousand Demonic Beast Arrays. Unless several Demigod rank experts had come, it would be impossible for the intruders to leave alive!</p><p>&#x201C;Let&#x2019;s go see!&#x201D; Ye Zong leaped towards the direction where the sounds had come from.</p><p>Nie Li immediately materialised a set of black and white wings and soared over.</p><p>Duan Jian, Du Ze, Ye Ziyun, and the rest followed behind them.</p><p>*Boom!* *Boom!* *Boom!*</p><p>An intense fight had broken out in the center of City Lord&#x2019;s Mansion. Countless buildings were wrecked and dust filled the sky. It looked as if a terrifying storm had swept through. Countless experts of Glory City stood in trees, on walls, and on roofs, all watching the intense fight in the center of the courtyard. A fight of this caliber was simply too frightening! It wasn&#x2019;t anything that the likes of them could withstand; therefore, none dared to approach!</p><p>Just who dared to behave so rudely in the City Lord&#x2019;s Mansion?</p><p></p><hr><p></p>
