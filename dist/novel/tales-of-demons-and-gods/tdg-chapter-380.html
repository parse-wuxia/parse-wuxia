<p>Chapter 380 - Accidental Encounter</p><p>Far away from Nie Li and his group were some people standing at the edge of the Void Illusionary Divine Palace&#x2019;s barrier, attempting to break in.</p><p>However, most of them couldn&#x2019;t accomplish it.</p><p>This entire mountain range, and surrounding forest, is a part of the Thousand Illusionary Array; entering isn&#x2019;t an easy feat.</p><p>Experts from both the human and demon clans glared at each other, like tigers stalking their prey. However, it was clear that none of them actually wanted to start a fight; they all maintained a certain distance from each other.</p><p>It was obvious that no one would benefit from a battle. In fact, they might even lose their chance to enter the Void Illusionary Divine Palace. They only had ten days to enter the palace; if no one could accomplish it, then the task would be even harder next time.</p><p>Nie Li landed outside the Void Illusionary Divine Palace&#x2019;s barrier, and observed the rainbow rays of light that fluctuated off of it. It was extremely magnificent.</p><p>Each color of the rainbow was a part of the Thousand Illusionary Array.</p><p>There were tens of thousands of people gathered outside the Thousand Illusionary Array. None of them could enter.</p><p>Wu Yazi looked at Nie Li and asked, &#x201C;How are we going to get in?&#x201D;</p><p>Nie Li turned to Wu Yazi and explained, &#x201C;It&#x2019;s still not time yet. The breach in the Thousand Illusionary Array only appears at noon, which is two hours from now.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Oh.&#x201D; Wu Yazi nodded. He could only listen to Nie Li. Wu Yazi didn&#x2019;t know if Nie Li was telling the truth, but he had a feeling that Nie Li definitely knew how to find the entrance to the Thousand Illusionary Array.</p><p>Nie Li continued refining the demon blood within his body.</p><p>Xiao Yu saw Nie Li cultivating, so she copied him.</p><p>At a location far from the Void Illusionary Divine Palace</p><p>A part of over thirty Heavenly Axis Realm experts reached the border of the Void Illusionary Divine Palace. The one leading them was Long Tianming.</p><p>He stood outside, glaring at the the Void Illusionary Palace.</p><p>One of Long Tianming&#x2019;s attendants, who wore golden armour, cupped his hands. &#x201C;Young Master, trying to break into the Thousand Illusionar Array will be extremely difficult. Not only that, there are a lot of demon clan experts in the area. Why would you wish to come, personally?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Time and tide wait for no man on the path of cultivation. This Void Illusionary Divine Palace was left behind by a supreme expert. Who knows if they might&#x2019;ve left behind some worthy inheritance inside? As long as there&#x2019;s a chance, I&#x2019;ll give it a try.&#x201D; Long Tianming stepped forward and condensed his energy. By now, he&#x2019;d already reached the Heavenly Axis Realm.</p><p>He&#x2019;d also integrated with a Dragon Bloodline God Level demon spirit; therefore, he was much stronger than an ordinary Heavenly Axis Realm expert.</p><p>A 1-stage Heavenly Axis Realm expert who&#x2019;d integrated with a Dragon Bloodline God Level demon spirit could easily face a 9-stage Heavenly Axis Realm expert, without a problem. This is the true power of a Dragon Bloodline God Level demon spirit!</p><p>Long Tianming used his senses to try and detect the location of the Thousand Illusionary Array&#x2019;s entrance; however, he remained in that silent state, with his brows knitted together.</p><p>The others in his party noticed that he&#x2019;d gone silent, so they respectfully stood to the side, not daring to speak.</p><p>From a certain distance, a group of demon clan experts had noticed Long Tianming&#x2019;s party. However, they didn&#x2019;t dare to provoke Long Tianming; after all, they had over thirty Heavenly Axis Realm experts on their side. No one would dare provoke them, unless they were a Dao of the Dragon Realm expert.</p><p>The crowd around the Thousand Illusionary Array gradually swelled. The number of small conflicts between the demon and human clans also increased and a battle would occasionally happen.</p><p>Nie Li had been cultivating for a while. Finally, he rose to his feet and began walking arounding the edge of the Thousand Illusionary Array as he carefully observed it.</p><p>Wu Yazi immediately followed behind him.</p><p>Nie Li glanced back at Wu Yazi and complained, &#x201C;Why are you following me so closely?&#x201D;</p><p>This guy wasn&#x2019;t leaving an inch of space between them.</p><p>Wu Yazi chuckled and replied, &#x201C;You&#x2019;re only at the Heavenly Fate Realm. There are a lot of Heavenly Axis Realms in the area. I&#x2019;m worried that you might run into some trouble!&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Rest assured. I&#x2019;ll definitely find the entrance of the Void Illusionary Divine Palace for you. But I&#x2019;ll remind you that we have a deal. We&#x2019;re going to split the treasures fifty-fifty! Furthermore, I get first pick!&#x201D; said Nie Li.</p><p>&#x201C;No problem!&#x201D; Wu Yazi agreed without the slightest hesitation, since it was all the same to him, anyways. Once they exited the Void Illusionary Divine Palace, he&#x2019;d kill both Nie Li and Xiao Yu. He could afford to let Nie Li choose first.</p><p>The three of them walked on.</p><p>&#x201C;Nie Li, look over there!&#x201D; Xiao Yu said as she pointed into the distance.</p><p>Nie Li followed Xiao Yu&#x2019;s direction and saw Long Tianming and his subordinates. They seemed to be busy with something over there.</p><p>Nie Li didn&#x2019;t have any conflicts with Long Tianming; however, his intuition told him that Long Tianming definitely wasn&#x2019;t a good guy. Therefore, Nie Li didn&#x2019;t have a good impression of him, not in the slightest.</p><p>Nie Li pondered for a brief moment, until an idea lit up his mind.</p><p>Since he and Xiao Yu weren&#x2019;t in their human forms, Long Tianming wouldn&#x2019;t recognise them, even if they stood in his way.</p><p>Nie Li intentionally moved closer to Long Tianming and his group, while pretending to examine the Thousand Illusionary Array.</p><p>&#x201C;The aura from this Thousand Illusionary Array is growing stronger. There&#x2019;s probably an entrance nearby!&#x201D; Nie Li excitedly claimed as he quickened his steps and moved closer towards Long Tianming and his group.</p><p>&#x201C;Wait! Those guys are all Heavenly Axis Realm experts!&#x201D; Wu Yazi called out to stop him.</p><p>Nie Li furrowed his brows for a moment, looked at Wu Yazi, and ask, &#x201C;What? You&#x2019;re saying you can&#x2019;t beat them?&#x201D;</p><p>The corner of Wu Yazi&#x2019;s mouth twitched as he said, &#x201C;That hilarious! There&#x2019;s no way I can&#x2019;t beat them! I could flip all of them, just by myself!&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Well then, there&#x2019;s nothing wrong!&#x201D; Nie Li said casually.</p><p>Wu Yazi furrowed his brows and said, &#x201C;But they still have over thirty Heavenly Axis Realm experts on their side. If a fight does break out, then trouble is unavoidable!&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Fine then. Just forget about it. Those guys are just gathered there, not moving at all. They&#x2019;ve probably found the entrance. If they manage to get in first, then all the good stuff might fall in their hands!&#x201D; Nie Li said with feigned indifference as he turned back.</p><p>Wu Yazi thought to himself, &#x2018;If the entrance really was close to them, then wouldn&#x2019;t he be losing by backing off like this?&#x2019;</p><p>In his point of view, those thirty-something Heavenly Axis Realms might pose a little trouble, but shouldn&#x2019;t be too hard to deal with.</p><p>Wu Yazi considered Nie Li&#x2019;s words, then said, &#x201C;You keep searching. If you can find the entrance, then everything&#x2019;s good. We&#x2019;ll chase them away, if there&#x2019;s really no other way in. If they&#x2019;re not tactful, then I&#x2019;ll take actions. After all, they&#x2019;re just humans!&#x201D;</p><p>An almost unnoticeable smile showed at the corner of Nie Li&#x2019;s mouth when he heard that. He continued moving towards Long Tianming&#x2019;s party.</p><p>The three of them approached Long Tianming and his group, but a golden-armoured Heavenly Axis Realm expert suddenly blocked their way. He furiously glared at them and said, &#x201C;Demon clan trash! Get lost! If you take another step forward, then don&#x2019;t blame me for taking action!&#x201D;</p><p>This man was one of Long Tianming&#x2019;s underlings, and was in charge of guarding the area. He&#x2019;d shouted at Nie Li&#x2019;s group when he saw them approach.</p><p>He could tell that Nie Li and Xiao Yu were only at the Heavenly Fate Realm. He couldn&#x2019;t discern Wu Yazi&#x2019;s cultivation, but what kind of expert would be with two Heavenly Fate Realms?</p><p>Wu Yazi&#x2019;s face turned black at the underling&#x2019;s words.</p><p>&#x201C;Who are you calling trash?!&#x201D; Wu Yazi coldly glared at the Heavenly Axis Realm expert.</p><p></p><hr><p></p><p></p><p style="text-align: center"><strong>&gt;&lt;</strong></p><p></p>
