<p><strong>Chapter 392 - Encounter with the Demon Lord, Again</strong></p><p>Nie Li sat under the Spiritual Void Wall with the verses of the chant projected on his retinas.</p><p>It was the [God Tongue] cultivation technique!</p><p>This cultivation technique was created by a supreme expert. Reaching the limit, you&#x2019;d be able to gain Deity ranked power.</p><p>The [God Tongue] cultivation technique was on par with the [Heavenly God] cultivation technique.</p><p>Could the owner of the Void Illusionary Divine Palace be the legendary Ancestral Master Daozang, the same one who&#x2019;d created the [God Tongue] cultivation technique?</p><p>The Ancestral Master Daozang was an extremely formidable figure.</p><p>He was also one of the most mysterious figures lost to history. No one knew anything about his life, only that he&#x2019;d fought and held his own against the full-strength Sage Emperor. He hadn&#x2019;t won, but he&#x2019;d manage to fully escape. Afterwards, he sealed away the Sage Emperor&#x2019;s demonic bone, and vanished without a trace.</p><p>Nie Li wondered whether this Void Illusionary Divine Palace was actually the tomb of the Ancestral Master Daozang.</p><p>The [God Tongue] technique is even harder to cultivate than the [Heavenly God] cultivation technique, as it requires the practitioner to have a sincere heart. Even though Nie Li had experienced two lifetimes&#x2019; worth of cultivation, he was still human. It was extremely difficult for him to cultivate the [God Tongue] to its full extent.</p><p>Nie Li quietly sat before the Spiritual Void Wall and stared at the various inscription patterns.</p><p>As Nie Li and his group quietly comprehended the wall, a pale-faced youth appeared.</p><p>Nie Li&#x2019;s pupils shrank and a chilling bloodlust flashed through his eyes.</p><p>It&#x2019;s the Demon Lord!</p><p>He never expected to encounter him in a place like this.</p><p>The Demon Lord clearly hadn&#x2019;t entered through the life gate. So how did he get in?</p><p>The Demon Lord swept an eye over his surroundings and ignored the cultivators as he approached the Spiritual Void Wall. Nie Li was still disguised as a demon clan expert, so the Demon Lord didn&#x2019;t recognise him as he seated himself amongst the crowd.</p><p>The Demon Lord sat only a dozen meters away from Nie Li. Surges of a mysterious aura curled around the Demon Lord.</p><p>Based on that aura, Nie Li could tell that the Demon Lord had reached 8-fate; however, there was something else inside that aura, something mysterious and powerful that caused a chill in Nie Li&#x2019;s heart.</p><p>Thanks to the vine inside Nie Li&#x2019;s body, his cultivation wasn&#x2019;t that fast. If it hadn&#x2019;t been for the Demon Blood Sacrifice, he&#x2019;d still be at 5-fate. However, the Demon Lord possessed the Supreme Physique; therefore, his cultivation had soared by leaps and bounds.</p><p>Nie Li remembered how Ye Zong had died at the hands of the Demon Lord, and his heart was filled with cold bloodlust. If it wasn&#x2019;t for him not being able to kill anyone here, he would&#x2019;ve already taken action. Even though there was something cold and mysterious inside the Demon Lord&#x2019;s body, Nie Li did not fear him.</p><p>The problem was that if he killed the Demon Lord now, the best he could do was lower the Demon Lord&#x2019;s cultivation by one stage.</p><p>The Demon Lord paid no attention to anything as he sat cross-legged and stared at the crystal jade wall with a deep expression.</p><p>Xiao Yu had met the Demon Lord once, back in the Tiny World. She recognised him, and knew that there was bad blood between him and Nie Li. She couldn&#x2019;t help glancing at Nie Li with concern. She sensed that the Demon Lord was a dangerous opponent.</p><p>The Demon Lord looked around him in disdain, then said, &#x201C;I never expected there to be so many people gathered around here. But you guys are stuck at such a low level; it just means that you&#x2019;re not fated for the Ancestral Master Daozang&#x2019;s secret treasure!&#x201D;</p><p>The Demon Lord stood up, and approached the crystal jade wall.</p><p>Everyone&#x2019;s attention was focused on the Demon Lord.</p><p>&#x201C;Someone&#x2019;s trying to break the crystal jade wall!&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Hahaha! He&#x2019;s so full of himself. It&#x2019;s impossible to break the crystal jade wall!&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;He&#x2019;ll probably go crying home about his failure!&#x201D;</p><p>Countless people had tried to break the inscription patterns before. All of them had ended in failure.</p><p>So, of course, they didn&#x2019;t think that the Demon Lord could accomplish it.</p><p>Nie Li watched the Demon Lord, and noted that his opponent felt a little different than before. However, he couldn&#x2019;t pinpoint exactly what was off.</p><p>The Demon Lord stopped before the crystal jade wall and placed his palm on its surface. Traces of mysterious light started to spread through the air.</p><p>The crystal jade wall immediately glowed with a harsh light that made everyone shield their eyes.</p><p>&#x201C;What&#x2019;s going on?&#x201D; Zhen Yuan said in astonishment.</p><p>Even Wu Yazi was astonished. What was that guy going?</p><p>Nie Li&#x2019;s heart slightly shook as he immediately stood up and shouted in a deep tone, &#x201C;Quick, stop him!&#x201D;</p><p>Hearing Nie Li&#x2019;s words, two demon clan experts who were closest to the Demon Lord had a flash of understanding. They stood up and pounced towards the Demon Lord.</p><p>However, the Demon Lord&#x2019;s body rapidly turned illusory and vanished into the crystal jade wall. He&#x2019;d disappeared, like a drop of water that had fallen into a lake.</p><p>The two demon clan experts missed their target and dumbfoundedly stared at the crystal jade wall.</p><p>&#x201C;What happened?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;He disappeared?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;He entered the crystal jade wall!&#x201D;</p><p>At the sight of this, all of the experts were inwardly vexed. They&#x2019;d been comprehending this crystal jade wall for so long, but none of them had ever been able to enter. But someone who&#x2019;d appeared just a few minutes ago had actually managed to solve the inscription patterns in one go.</p><p>Nie Li tightly clenched his fists. Even he didn&#x2019;t know how the Demon Lord had managed to open and enter the crystal jade wall.</p><p>According to his calculations, the other experts who were gathered outside the Divine Illusionary Palace should&#x2019;ve already broken the barrier and rushed in!</p><p>Could the Demon Lord have entered the Void Illusionary Divine Palace before Nie Li had shattered the Thousand Illusionary Array?</p><p>It looked like Nie Li had greatly underestimated the Demon Lord.</p><p>The crowd had watched the Demon Lord disappear, but the only thing they could do was return to comprehending the crystal jade wall with indignation.</p><p>Nie Li fixed his eyes on the crystal jade wall and rapidly tried to figure out the inscription patterns on it. It only took him a brief moment before he found the solution.</p><p>Nie Li transmitted his voice to Xiao Yu. &#x201C;Stay here, next to the jade wall and focus on comprehending it! Don&#x2019;t leave before I get back. The outside is just too dangerous!&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;En.&#x201D; Xiao Yu acknowledged. She was puzzled. Could Nie Li have solved the puzzle?</p><p>Nie Li approached the crystal jade wall.</p><p>&#x201C;Someone&#x2019;s trying to break the inscription pattern array! Again!&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;The only ones who can break the inscription pattern array are geniuses that appear once in ten thousand. You&#x2019;d be lucky to find one of them in a hundred thousand years. How&#x2019;d we get two in a row?!&#x201D;</p><p>Everyone scrutinised Nie Li, with the ones seated the closest eyeing him like tigers eyeing their prey. Earlier, the Demon Lord had opened the door too fast, so they didn&#x2019;t have time to stop him. But if Nie Li managed to open the crystal jade wall, they definitely wouldn&#x2019;t let him through.</p><p>Nie Li lifted his hand and knocked on the crystal jade wall.</p><p>*Knock! Knock! Knock!*</p><p>The sounds echoed off the crystal jade wall.</p><p>The experts next to him laughed involuntarily. Nie Li was acting like such an amateur! No matter how you explained it, it didn&#x2019;t look like Nie Li knew how to break the crystal jade wall.</p><p></p><hr><p></p><p></p><p style="text-align: center"><strong>&gt;&lt;</strong></p><p></p>
