<p>Chapter 464 - Sect Protecting Array</p><p><br></p><p>Yao Lie was ranked 2 within the Demon God&#x2019;s Sect. He spent most of his time in closed-doors training and rarely showed himself.</p><p><br></p><p>Although there were scuffles between the Demon God&#x2019;s Sect and the Heavenly Note Sect, they would rarely dispatch their Martial Ancestor Realm experts to confront one another.</p><p><br></p><p>Although the Demon God&#x2019;s Sect was much stronger compared to the Heavenly Note Sect, it was still tough for them to annihilate the entire Heavenly Note Sect. Killing thousands while sacrificing eight hundred. If the Heavenly Note Sect was to be attacked, the five other sects would definitely not stand by and watch.</p><p><br></p><p>The three Demonic Sects and Six Divine Sects have always been calm.</p><p><br></p><p>Today, the Demon God&#x2019;s Sect had suddenly attacked. From their ferocious momentum, Nangong Xianyin felt extreme unease in her heart.</p><p><br></p><p>Although they recently had the help of Nie Li&#x2019;s elixirs, which greatly enhanced the strength of the Heavenly Note Sect, compared to the Demon God&#x2019;s Sect, it was way inferior.</p><p><br></p><p>Torrential Demonic Aura burst forth from Yao Lie as he sent out a palm towards the Great Heavenly Note Array.</p><p><br></p><p>Nangong Xianyin unleashed an enraged roar as formless energy confronted against the Demonic Aura.</p><p><br></p><p>The Great Heavenly Note Array lightly shook, but managed to remain intact. However, the surrounding disciples of the Great Heavenly Note Array issued miserable shrieks as they fell from the sky as the Demonic Aura invaded their bodies.</p><p><br></p><p>&#x201C;Sect Master, with our strength, I&#x2019;m afraid that we will not be able to hold up for long!&#x201D;&#xA0;</p><p><br></p><p>&#x201C;Yao Lie, that demon, since when did he grow so strong!?&#x201D;</p><p><br></p><p>A bitter expression surfaced on the face of several Martial Ancestor Realm experts. That invasive Demonic Aura seemed as if it could erode everything and could slowly break down their energy.</p><p><br></p><p>&#x201C;Sect Master, we&#x2019;re still unsure if Yao Lie came alone. If Luo Xinxin, that demoness, came as well&#x2026;&#x201D;</p><p><br></p><p>&#x201C;Sect Master, it seems like we have to activate the Sect Protecting Array.&#x201D; One of the Martial Ancestor experts said with much anxiousness.</p><p><br></p><p>Nangong Xianyin lightly furrowed her brows and after a brief consideration, she barked, &#x201C;Activate the Sect Protecting Array.&#x201D;</p><p><br></p><p>One light after another quickly rose like a rainbow and shrouded the entire Heavenly Note Sect.</p><p><br></p><p>Bang! Bang! Bang!</p><p><br></p><p>The layers of Demonic Aura constantly attacked the seven-coloured rainbow. Layers upon layers of energy rippled as the Demonic Aura dispersed.</p><p><br></p><p>However, Yao Lie continued his advance and slowly concealed himself within the dark layers of clouds and looked down at the Heavenly Note Sect.</p><p><br></p><p>When Nangong Xianyin and her group landed from the sky, all of them looked a little sorry. Earlier, Yao Lie&#x2019;s Demonic Aura was way too powerful and was a little hard for them to deal with.</p><p><br></p><p>&#x201C;This Sect Protecting Array will withstand his attacks for a few days. I hope that the other Divine Sects will receive this news and aid us.&#x201D; One of the Martial Ancestor Realm expert said with dejection.</p><p><br></p><p>This confrontation with Yao Lie damaged their morale.</p><p><br></p><p>The Sect Master of the Demon God&#x2019;s Sect, Luo Xinxin had not come personally, it was only Yao Lie and they had already encountered issues to withstand his attack. What would happen when Luo Xinxin that demoness were to come here personally?</p><p><br></p><p>&#x201C;It seems that those people of the Demon God&#x2019;s Sect does not want to attack our Sect Protecting Array!&#x201D; One of the Martial Ancestor Realm expert said with suspicion as he rose his head to the air.</p><p><br></p><p>&#x201C;Just what are they planning?&#x201D;</p><p><br></p><p>If the Demon God&#x2019;s Sect were to attack their Sect Protecting Array, the array would ladt for six to seven days. However, if the Demon God&#x2019;s Sect stopped their advance, the array would last for half a year.</p><p><br></p><p>&#x201C;Just what are they planning?&#x201D; Nangong Xianyin furrowed her brows. She could vaguely sense that this matter was not that simple.</p><p><br></p><p>&#x201C;Sect Master, could it be that they only wanted to trap us?&#x201D; One of the Martial Ancestor Realm expert said with doubt.</p><p><br></p><p>A sense of unease revolved.</p><p><br></p><p>&#x201C;Regardless, we have to notify the other Divine Sects as soon as possible. Just us alone, we are not the opponent of the Demon God&#x2019;s Sect.&#x201D; Nangong Xianyin solemnly said.</p><p><br></p><p>Among all the sects, the Demon God&#x2019;s Sect was the strongest, while the Heavenly Note Sect was ranked around the middle.</p><p><br></p><p>Their difference in strength wasn&#x2019;t just a little.</p><p><br></p><p>Furthermore, Yao Lie&#x2019;s strength had experienced a great enhancement that far surpassed their imagination. If it wasn&#x2019;t for Nie Li&#x2019;s elixirs, they would have already been destroyed.</p><p><br></p><p>Just what was going on?</p><p><br></p><p>Why did Yao Lie&#x2019;s strength grow so fast?!</p><p><br></p><p>Furthermore, the Demonic Aura earlier was filled with horrifying energy that made even her feel a chill down into her bones. That level of Demonic Aura was something that she had never seen before!</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>At this instant, Nie Li abruptly opened his eyes within the Myriad Miles Rivers and Mountains Painting. He had completed the fusion of the Thunder God&#x2019;s Meteorite Sword. The current sword was indestructible and the strength was way beyond imagination.</p><p><br></p><p>Although Nie Li did not possess the strength of a Martial Ancestor Realm nor can he defeat an expert of that level, his physical body could withstand the attack from any Martial Ancestor Realm expert.</p><p><br></p><p>That was because his physical body was as strong as his sword!</p><p><br></p><p>Seeing Nie Li regain his conscious, Xiao Ning&#x2019;er and Ye Ziyun hurried over.</p><p><br></p><p>&#x201C;Nie Li, how are you?&#x201D; Xiao Ning&#x2019;er asked with concern.</p><p><br></p><p>Ye Ziyun&#x2019;s gaze also fell onto him as she had her eyes narrowed from her smile.</p><p><br></p><p>&#x201C;Was there anything on me?&#x201D; Nie Li lowered his head and look at himself.</p><p><br></p><p>&#x201C;When you were cultivating, Ning&#x2019;er&#x2019;s eyes have never left you!&#x201D; Ye Ziyun smiled as she said.</p><p><br></p><p>Hearing her words, Xiao Ning&#x2019;er blushed.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>&#x201C;Ning&#x2019;er was concern about me, what about you?&#x201D; Nie Li looked at Ye Ziyun as he asked with a smile.</p><p><br></p><p>&#x201C;I can&#x2019;t be bothered with you!&#x201D; Ye Ziyun snorted.</p><p><br></p><p>Nie Li lightly smiled. He was naturally well aware of Ye Ziyun&#x2019;s character, she would never admit it.</p><p><br></p><p>&#x201C;Let&#x2019;s go out then.&#x201D; Nie Li smiled, &#x201C;We still have to make a trip back to the Divine Feathers Sect.&#x201D;</p><p><br></p><p>&#x201C;Okay.&#x201D; Ye Ziyun nodded her head. She had already made her preparations to leave for the Divine Feathers Sect with Nie Li.</p><p><br></p><p>The three of them exited from the painting, which was stored away by Nie Li.</p><p><br></p><p>Just when Nie Li and his group came out, they instantly sensed something abnormal, since there were traces of battles all around. When Nie Li raised his head, he saw a rainbow light screen that covered the entire Heavenly Note Sect.</p><p><br></p><p>&#x201C;The Heavenly Note Sect was attacked!&#x201D; Nie Li was startled in his heart. At this time, only the Demon God&#x2019;s Sect would attack the Heavenly Note Sect.</p><p><br></p><p>&#x201C;Nie Li, what happened?&#x201D; Ye Ziyun asked with curiosity.</p><p><br></p><p>&#x201C;Nie Li, I received a message from Master! Our Heavenly Note Sect was attacked by the Demon God&#x2019;s Sect and thus, activated the Sect Protecting Array. At this point of time, we are still fine. Master requested for me and Ye Ziyun to hurry over!&#x201D; Xiao Ning&#x2019;er turned her head towards Nie Li.</p><p><br></p><p>Nie Li pondered for a brief second and answered, &#x201C;The both of you go find her and find out what the situation is. I will find the both of you shortly!&#x201D;</p><p><br></p><p>&#x201C;Okay, be cautious!&#x201D; Ye Ziyun said after some thoughts.</p><p><br></p><p>&#x201C;Nie Li, be careful!&#x201D; Xiao Ning&#x2019;er looked at Nie Li.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>&#x201C;Rest assured, even if it was the Demon God&#x2019;s Sect, no one can do a thing to me!&#x201D; Nie Li laughed with confidence.</p><p><br></p>
