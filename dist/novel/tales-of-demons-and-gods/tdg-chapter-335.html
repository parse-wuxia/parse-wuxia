<p><strong>Chapter 335 - Bastard</strong></p><p>Suddenly, an explosion sounded from the bottom of the Deity&#x2019;s Lake. The entire lake began quaking, as if it were about to crumble.</p><p>The rupture inscription patterns that Nie Li had placed were finally doing their job.</p><p>It was impossible for the rupture inscription patterns to destroy the Deity&#x2019;s Lake, but it still caused quite a considerable commotion with its series of explosions.</p><p>At last, that Dao of Dragon Realm Infernal Lightning Winged Snake Emperor couldn&#x2019;t stand it anymore. What a huge commotion! Was someone trying to destroy its Deity&#x2019;s Lake?</p><p>*Woosh!*</p><p>The Infernal Lightning Winged Snake Emperor soared into the sky. With a *woosh*, it turned into a streak of light, on its way to see what was going on at the bottom of the Deity&#x2019;s Lake.</p><p>Once the Infernal Lightning Winged Snake Emperor left, Nie Li and Li Xingyun immediately took action.</p><p>Their window of opportunity wasn&#x2019;t very large!</p><p>Nie Li and Li Xingyun entered the Deity&#x2019;s Lake. The remaining Infernal Lightning Winged Snakes realised that strangers were invading. They flapped their wings and pounced towards Nie Li and his group.</p><p>&#x201C;Kill them!&#x201D; Li Xingyun barked and immediately charged forward with his men.</p><p>*Boom!* *Boom!* *Boom!*</p><p>A chaotic war burst out as Li Xingyun and five hundred of his men attacked the Infernal Lightning Winged Snakes.</p><p>&#x201C;Brother Nie Li, we&#x2019;ll stall them! You go in! Hurry!&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Yes!&#x201D; Nie Li nodded as he merged with his Bloodwing Saint Jiao-dragon, flapped his wings, and flew down.</p><p>*Boom!* *Boom!* *Boom!*</p><p>Nie Li collided with several Infernal Lightning Winged Snakes; however, he powered through with his powerful physique.</p><p>*Boom!* *Boom!* *Boom!*</p><p>More infernal lightning attacks struck Nie Li, but thanks to the Bloodwing Saint Jiao-dragon&#x2019;s physique, Nie Li possessed a powerful resistance towards fire-attribute attacks. Therefore, he didn&#x2019;t suffer many injuries.</p><p>Three Heavenly Star Realm Infernal Lightning Winged Snakes surrounded Nie Li, trying to stop him. However, Li Xingyun and his men quickly intervened.</p><p>Swords flashed and blood splattered. The three Infernal Lightning Winged Snakes were diced and sent writhing as they fell from the sky.</p><p>At last, Nie Li broke through the heavy siege, landed on the Deity&#x2019;s Lake, and rapidly laid down his inscription patterns. One by one, the designs fell into the lake and blasted its bottom.</p><p>There were many spiritual stones and spiritual stone essences lying at the bottom of the Deity&#x2019;s Lake, but Nie Li didn&#x2019;t give them a second thought as he continued to focus on writing the inscription patterns.</p><p>Li Xingyun and his men entered a harsh battle that brought death to many of his subordinates. However, many of the Infernal Lightning Winged Snakes were also being killed.</p><p>As Li Xingyun and his men were caught up in a heated battle, the enormous Infernal Lightning Winged Snake Emperor appeared again. This was their king, a demon spirit of the Dao of Dragon Realm. Once it realised that the bottom of the Deity&#x2019;s Lake were just merely explosion, it quickly returned to the surface find Li Xingyun and his men closing in on the Deity&#x2019;s Lake. It was instantly enraged.</p><p>The Infernal Lightning Winged Snake Emperor shrouded itself in a rolling cloud of Infernal Lightning and dived down. Its blazing flames seemed as though they were trying to melt everything.</p><p>Li Xingyun and his group never expected the emperor to return so quickly. His face changed as he barked, &#x201C;Get over there and obstruct it!&#x201D;</p><p>Li Xingyun&#x2019;s voice sounded</p><p>*Woosh!* *Woosh!* *Woosh!*</p><p>Countless figures charged the Infernal Lightning Winged Snake Emperor.</p><p>The emperor hissed as it flicked its red tongue and ruthlessly whipped its tail.</p><p>The tail struck dozens of people, turning them into explosions of flesh, burnt to ashes. Among them were a few who were at least of the Heavenly Star Realm.</p><p>The strength of that Dao of Dragon Realm Infernal Lightning Winged Snake Emperor was unimaginable.</p><p>However, there were still many people who charged towards it.</p><p>While Li Xingyun and his men were fighting, Nie Li concentrated on writing inscription patterns.</p><p>The inscription patterns dived downwards into the lake and gradually merged into one huge inscription pattern array, emitting a dazzling luster.</p><p>The Infernal Lightning Winged Snake Emperor issued an angry roar as it sensed the array. All of a sudden, it charged downwards.</p><p>Li Xingyun&#x2019;s face went cold. He couldn&#x2019;t allow that Infernal Lightning Winged Snake Emperor to approach Nie Li. Otherwise, everything that they&#x2019;d done up to now would end up in vain.</p><p>&#x201C;Move together!&#x201D; Li Xingyun furiously roared as he lead his remaining men and charged the Infernal Lightning Winged Snake Emperor.</p><p>Li Xingyun roared and merged with his Dragon Bloodline God Level Demon Spirit. His subordinates also merged with their own demon spirits.</p><p>The Infernal Lightning Winged Snake Emperor furiously spat out more flames, filling the sky and turning the area into a flaming sea. Hundreds of people were instantly vaporized. The flames also headed in Nie Li&#x2019;s direction.</p><p>Li Xingyun, who&#x2019;d already transformed into a Gold-Scarlet Blooded Jiao-dragon, brandished his sharp claws and dispersed the flames. In the process, his palms were charred black.</p><p>&#x201C;Your opponent is me!&#x201D; Li Xingyun coldly stared at the Infernal Lightning Winged Snake Emperor. Although the emperor before him was of Dao of Dragon Realm, Li Xingyun didn&#x2019;t feel the slightest fear. On the contrary, a powerful fighting spirit burst forth from him.</p><p>The Infernal Lightning Winged Snake Emperor never expected that an ant would actually dare to challenge the likeness of itself. It locked its aura on Li Xingyun, roared, and pounced with wings flapping.</p><p>That terrifying might instantly bored down on Li Xingyun, pressuring him to the point where he couldn&#x2019;t move.</p><p>&#x201C;Boss Xingyun, be careful!&#x201D; Two Heavenly Axis Realm experts charged the Infernal Lightning Winged Snake Emperor.</p><p>*Boom!* *Boom!*</p><p>The two Heavenly Axis Realm experts died from the Infernal Lightning Winged Snake Emperor&#x2019;s impacts.</p><p>Li Xingyun managed to escape, but when he saw that two of his brothers had been killed in front of him, his field of vision instantly turned red. However, the emperor&#x2019;s powerful bursts of aura made him realise that, at his current strength, it was impossible for him to confront it. Instead, just obstructing its path would be enough!</p><p>Li Xingyun exhaled a dragon&#x2019;s breath from his mouth that exploded at it landed on the Infernal Lightning Winged Snake Emperor. However, his dragon&#x2019;s breath was unable to cause any damage to the creature.</p><p>The Infernal Lightning Winged Snake Emperor swept a glance at Li Xingyun. This demon spirit had an intelligence that was comparable to a human&#x2019;s; it could tell that Li Xingyun was only trying to stall it. The linchpin was that human standing in the middle of the Deity&#x2019;s Lake!</p><p>The Infernal Lightning Winged Snake Emperor ignored Li Xingyun and charged towards Nie Li.</p><p>The Infernal Lightning Winged Snake Emperor got closer and closer to Nie Li and it breathed its flames towards him.</p><p>&#x201C;No!&#x201D; Li Xingyun wanted to charge up there, but it was already too late. He was way too slow compared to the Infernal Lightning Winged Snake Emperor.</p><p>Nie Li was about to be devoured by the blazing heat, but he continued calmly writing the inscription patterns, until the design was finished. A snake-like object flew up from the center of the lake, struggling as it went.</p><p>This was the Deity Root of this Deity&#x2019;s Lake!</p><p>Nie Li grabbed the Deity Root and threw it into the Myriad Miles Rivers and Mountains Painting.</p><p>Now that he&#x2019;d finally gotten his hands on it, a smile showed at the corner of his mouth.</p><p>The moment Nie Li obtained the Deity Root, he merged with his Shadow Devil and activated its void-form.</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>Flames blasted the Deity&#x2019;s Lake, evaporating the water upon contact. A thick, white steam filled the sky.</p><p>How dangerous!</p><p>Nie Li dodged the flames and immediately moved away from the lake, quickly flying out. The steam had created a good cover for his escape.</p><p>The Infernal Lightning Winged Snake Emperor blankly stared at the lake for a while; it hadn&#x2019;t realised what had actually happened. It still thought that it&#x2019;d killed Nie Li. As it stared into the depths of the Deity&#x2019;s Lake, it could sense that something was off; however, it couldn&#x2019;t tell exactly what that &#x201C;something&#x201D; was.</p><p>Back while Li Xingyun was fighting the Infernal Lightning Winged Snake Emperor, Gu Heng was observing from few meters away with his men.</p><p>&#x201C;Haha! It seems that Li Xingyun&#x2019;s men were beaten quite badly!&#x201D; Gu Heng said, feeling a little joy at Li Xingyun&#x2019;s misfortune. That Infernal Lightning Winged Snake Emperor was too powerful. After Gu Heng pondered for a moment, it was best for them to not provoke it.</p><p>After coming all the way here and realising that he couldn&#x2019;t do anything, Gu Heng felt a little unhappy. He could only look at the medium grade Deity&#x2019;s Lake in front of him and feel gloomy.</p><p>Suddenly, the Deity&#x2019;s Lake filled with cracks and started to crumble.</p><p>What was going on?</p><p>Gu Heng was stunned for a moment. Why would a perfectly good Deity&#x2019;s Lake suddenly crumble?</p><p>Only now did the Infernal Lightning Winged Snake Emperor react. It didn&#x2019;t know what the intruders had done to its Deity&#x2019;s Lake, but it could sense that the lake&#x2019;s strength was being sucked dry. Rage filled its heart. Someone was actually trying to destroy its Deity&#x2019;s Lake!</p><p>Those damnable humans!</p><p>As that was happening at the Deity&#x2019;s lake, something happened thousands of metres away. Another aura had appeared.</p><p>The person who&#x2019;d been standing at the heart of the Deity&#x2019;s Lake wasn&#x2019;t dead!</p><p>That person definitely took something from the Deity&#x2019;s Lake!</p><p>The Infernal Lightning Winged Snake Emperor flapped its wings and chased after Nie Li. Its entire body turned scarlet red as it became consumed with rage.</p><p>The moment Nie Li appeared, a pair black and white wings quickly unfurled behind him. He became like a meteor, streaking away through the sky.</p><p>&#x201C;Brother Xingyun, don&#x2019;t follow me. Take your brothers and quickly retreat!&#x201D; Nie Li yelled as he ran. At that moment, the Infernal Lightning Winged Snake Emperor definitely had its eyes on him. If Li Xingyun were to follow, there&#x2019;d definitely be an increase in casualties.</p><p>Li Xingyun frowned for a moment. Nie Li had obtained the Deity Root, but it should be stored in his interspatial ring. If Nie Li died, then the Deity Root would be gone! However, under the current situation, he didn&#x2019;t too much time to dwell on it. He followed Nie Li&#x2019;s suggestion and led his men in retreat.</p><p>What Li Xingyun didn&#x2019;t know was that Nie Li&#x2019;s Deity Root wasn&#x2019;t inside an interspatial ring; it was actually inside the Myriad Miles Rivers and Mountains Painting, which was fused with Nie Li&#x2019;s fate soul. Such a treasure wouldn&#x2019;t drop, even if Nie Li was killed.</p><p>Therefore, as he ran, Nie Li made mental preparations for his own death.</p><p>After all, escaping from the claws of a Dao of Dragon Realm Infernal Lightning Winged Snake Emperor wasn&#x2019;t going to be easy. If at all possible.</p><p>However, Nie Li suddenly saw Gu Heng&#x2019;s men from afar. An idea flashed across his mind and he flew in Gu Heng&#x2019;s direction.</p><p>Gu Heng was rejoicing at the carnage that&#x2019;d been wrought on Li Xingyun&#x2019;s army. But suddenly, he noticed a figure turn into a streak of light and fly in his direction. That person was Nie Li. Behind him was the titanic Infernal Lightning Winged Snake Emperor, roaring as it emitted frightening might from its body. It was an existence that was at least of the Dao of Dragon Realm.</p><p>Gu Heng&#x2019;s smile froze on his face, then turned black and he cursed, &#x201C;Nie Li, you bastard! Everyone evacuate!&#x201D;</p><p></p><hr><p></p><p></p><p style="text-align: center"><strong>&gt;&lt;</strong></p><p></p>
