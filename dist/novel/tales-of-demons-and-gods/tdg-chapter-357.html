<p><strong>Chapter 357 - The Big Five</strong></p><p>This raised everyone&apos;s expectations a little. They never thought that Venerable Flameless would accuse Nie Li of being a spy from the Demon God&#x2019;s Sect.</p><p>Was the Venerable Flameless speaking the truth, or was he just making it up?</p><p>All of the East District&#x2019;s students were watching the situation unfold, but the majority of them didn&apos;t believe it. Unless Venerable Flameless provided sufficient proof, it was more likely to just be slander. Anyone could tell that the relationship between Venerable Flameless and Nie Li wasn&#x2019;t very good.</p><p>Huang Yu and Nanmen Tianhai both couldn&#x2019;t help frowning. They already understood what kind of person Venerable Flameless was. It was more likely that he&apos;d flown into a rage out of humiliation, because his plot against Nie Li had failed!</p><p>Li Xingyun pointed at Venerable Flameless and yelled, &#x201C;Actually, Venerable Flameless is the real spy! He discovered how talented Nie Li was and felt threatened, so he tried to kill to him to remove a threat for the Demon God&#x2019;s Sect!&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;That&#x2019;s right, I can testify to that!&#x201D; Lu Piao stood out.</p><p>&#x201C;I can also testify to that!&#x201D; Gu Bei stood out as well.</p><p>&#x201C;Me too!&#x201D; Long Yuyin and Xiao Yu also stood out.</p><p>Voices popped up everywhere, enraging Venerable Flameless. He pointed at Li Xingyun and the group as he barked, &#x201C;You&apos;re just slandering me. What proof do you have?&#x201D;</p><p>Hearing Venerable Flameless&#x2019;s words, Li Xingyun laughed three times and said, &#x201C;Then what proof does Venerable Flameless have to accuse Nie Li of being a spy? I, Li Xingyun, can guarantee with all my pride that Nie Li is not a spy!&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;So can I!&#x201D; Gu Bei solemnly said.</p><p>&#x201C;Myself as well!&#x201D; Long Yuyin said without any hesitation.</p><p>&#x201C;You&#x2026;&#x201D; Venerable Flameless was enraged within his heart. He never thought that there&#x2019;d be so many people standing by Nie Li&#x2019;s side. Furthermore, Li Xingyun, Gu Bei, and Long Yuyin all had rather special identities. If Nie Li was a spy, then didn&#x2019;t that mean that Li Xingyun, Gu Bei, and Long Yuyin from the three major families were harbouring a spy?</p><p>Venerable Flameless said in a solemn voice, &#x201C;The three of you, don&#x2019;t be deceived by him! Don&apos;t you think it&apos;s fishy that someone from the Tiny World, without any background, could make direct descendents of the three major families speak for him?&#x201D;</p><p>Nie Li pointed at Venerable Flameless as he coldly smiled. &#x201C;Then how can Venerable Flameless be certain that I&#x2019;m a spy? In these hundreds of years, have any spies from the Demon God&#x2019;s Sect ever managed to sneak into the Divine Feathers Sect? Even Hierarch Skycloud believes in me and took me in as his disciple. Yet, Venerable Flameless firmly believes that a disciple of Hierarch Skycloud, your own Junior Brother, is a spy of the Demon God&#x2019;s Sect. I wonder what your intentions are behind this? Could you be fighting over favouritism?&#x201D;</p><p>Upon hearing Nie Li&#x2019;s words, those who weren&#x2019;t sure of the truth more or less believed him. The possibility that Venerable Flameless was trying to fight Nie Li for favouritism was indeed higher.</p><p>&#x201C;Competing over favouritism? Hahaha!&#x201D; Venerable Flameless laughed. &#x201C;A coward like you, who doesn&#x2019;t dare to step onto the stage, is qualified to compete with me?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;I won&#x2019;t fall for your words! I&#x2019;ll say it again. If you dare to challenge a Martial Ancestor Realm expert, then I&#x2019;ll also dare to challenge him!&#x201D; Nie Li calmly said as he pointed at Guo Huai, who was standing not far away. Nie Li didn&#x2019;t know what his chances were against Guo Huai, but he knew that it wasn&#x2019;t zero. Nie Li had merged with his Bloodwing Saint Jiao-dragon earlier, but he&#x2019;d only used a portion of its strength; he still hadn&#x2019;t unleashed its full potential.</p><p>However, there was no need for Nie Li to risk his life!</p><p>Venerable Flameless was a Dao of Dragon Realm expert. To think that he&#x2019;d actually use such despicable method to deal with Nie Li. Nie Li had to be cautious in the future, and make sure not to give Venerable Flameless any more chances!</p><p>By now, the five major figures had already noticed the situation occurring on the marital field, as well as everything that&#x2019;d happened up to that point.</p><p>The five powerful figures conversed amongst themselves.</p><p>&#x201C;Skycloud, this Nie Li is already your disciple?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Indeed.&#x201D; Hierarch Skycloud&#x2019;s voice raised in spirals.</p><p>&#x201C;Hierarch Skycloud certainly moves quickly. In these hundred years, such a talent is an absolute rarity.&#x201D; The voice was empty and distant, with a twinge of regret.</p><p>&#x201C;Could it be that Lord Sect Master&#x2019;s heart are been moved? Just focus and teach your grandson Situ Beiyan!&#x201D; a flirtatious voice sounded.</p><p>&#x201C;Situ Beiyan&#x2019;s talent isn&#x2019;t bad, but he could barely break through to the Martial Ancestor Realm and dominate a single region. It&#x2019;s too hard for him to become Sect Master of the Divine Feathers Sect!&#x201D; the voice sighed.</p><p>&#x201C;I never thought that Lord Sect Master would think so highly of Nie Li. Why don&#x2019;t we have Nie Li learn under the Sect Master!&#x201D; Hierarch Skycloud lightly smiled.</p><p>&#x201C;A gentleman would never steal someone else&#x2019;s favourite. If there&#x2019;s a member of the younger generation who possesses extraordinary talent and can stand independently, then they must be well nurtured. We must observe this Nie Li!&#x201D; the voice calmly replied. &#x201C;In one hundred years, the Divine Feathers Sect will be left to these younger generations to manage; therefore, we must be prudent in our selection!&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Venerable Flameless and Nie Li seem to have some conflicts. Hierarch Skycloud isn&#x2019;t going to meditate it?&#x201D; that flirtatious voice chuckled.</p><p>&#x201C;It&#x2019;s nothing but a meaningless dispute amongst younger generations. Let them be!&#x201D; Hierarch Skycloud said lightly.</p><p>Aside from those three voices, there were two more auras observing Nie Li. A fifteen or sixteen year-old youth had actually integrated with a God Level Bloodwing Saint Jiao-dragon and crushed a 6-fate genius with his 4-fate strength. This is indeed hard to come by.</p><p>Just as Nie Li was about to leave the field, a voice like thin silk transmitted itself to him.</p><p>&#x201C;Nie Li!&#x201D;</p><p>Nie Li&#x2019;s heart shook when he heard the voice, and he straightened his posture. &#x201C;Hierarch Skycloud!&#x2019;</p><p>&#x201C;Do your best and fight with Guo Huai. You don&#x2019;t have to hold back. Don&#x2019;t worry, I&#x2019;ll protect your fate soul from dispersing. Several lords wish to see your strength and talent!&#x201D; said the Hierarch Skycloud.</p><p>&#x201C;Yes!&#x201D; Nie Li replied as his heart quivered. The &#x201C;several lords&#x201D; that Hierarch Skycloud spoke of should be the other members of the big five. Since Hierarch Skycloud had already told him to go for it, a blaze of fighting spirit flashed through Nie Li&#x2019;s eyes. Since the big five wanted to see, then he&#x2019;d have to put up a good performance for them!</p><p>After all, if he wanted to become the Sect Master of the Divine Feathers Sect, then he&#x2019;d have to obtain the big five&#x2019;s acknowledgement.</p><p>Nie Li didn&#x2019;t know who the big five were, but if he could obtain the support of another member of them, then it&#x2019;d definitely be of great help to him in the future.</p><p>No one else, from the ordinary students, to the teachers, to Venerable Flameless and the two elders themselves, were aware of the conversation happening between the big five.</p><p>Venerable Flameless looked at Nie Li&#x2019;s silhouette as he felt dejected. But suddenly, Nie Li turned back.</p><p>Nie Li faced Venerable Flameless as he said, &#x201C;I&#x2019;ll agree to the second match. I won&#x2019;t use any artifacts, either!&#x201D;</p><p>Upon hearing Nie Li&#x2019;s words, everyone was stunned and looked at him dumbfoundedly. Nie Li&#x2019;s brain must be fried. He disagreed to it just a moment ago, so why did he suddenly agree to it?</p><p>A 4-fate fighting a 9-fate. Furthermore, the other party was obviously trying to kill him.</p><p>Was Nie Li tired of living? He was obviously walking to his own death!</p><p></p><hr><p></p><p></p><p style="text-align: center"><strong>&gt;&lt;</strong></p><p></p>
