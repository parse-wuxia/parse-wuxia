<p><strong>Chapter 371 - Escaped?</strong></p><p>What Gu Heng didn&#x2019;t know was that in addition to the Heavenly Path and Demon League members, Long Yuyin had also sent a hundred of her own Heavenly Axis Realm experts as reinforcements.</p><p>Long Yuyin hadn&#x2019;t formally announced that her Profound Note League was allied with the Heavenly Path and Demon Leagues; however, the Profound Note League had always been supporting them. For example, by sending over a hundred Heavenly Axis Realm experts.</p><p>These hundred Heavenly Axis Realm experts had masked their outer appearances, so that Gu Heng&#x2019;s men wouldn&#x2019;t be able to recognise them, much less tell that they were from the Profound Note League.</p><p>Since Gu Heng had some reinforcements, it wouldn&#x2019;t be unusual for the Heavenly Path and Demon Leagues to have their own reinforcements as well.</p><p>As the two forces fought each other, another five or six thousand people flew in from nowhere and joined the battle. They were obviously there to aid Gu Heng.</p><p>&#x201C;They&#x2019;re Li Yufeng&#x2019;s men!&#x201D; Li Xingyun furrowed his brows. He never expected Li Yufeng to take action, as well. However, since Li Xingyun and Li Yufeng had always been in disputes, it wasn&#x2019;t surprising that Li Yufeng would join the battle against them. Although Li Yufeng&#x2019;s Wind Intent League was far inferior than his Heavenly Path League, they were still a rather considerable force with large numbers.</p><p>Li Yufeng himself wasn&#x2019;t present. That was his style; he was a miser about his own cultivation. But because he never participated in battles, there were also few experts willing to follow him.</p><p>The Heavenly Path and Demon Leagues were now at even more of a disadvantage; the pressure was even stronger.</p><p>However, Li Xingyun, Gu Bei, and co. had a very simple objective; they were to keep Gu Heng&#x2019;s men from getting close to Nie Li, and they were doing a good job of it.</p><p>Nie Li was done repairing the inscription pattern array. Dazzling lights revolved around the design. Pulled by the force of the array, the Deity Root gradually floated to the surface.</p><p>At the sight of this, Gu Heng anxiously yelled, &#x201C;Stop him!&#x201D;</p><p>He didn&#x2019;t know what Nie Li was doing, but he knew that if it was completed, then he&#x2019;d be in trouble!</p><p>Dragon flames rained down in Nie Li&#x2019;s direction.</p><p>The dragon flames were about to land on Nie Li, but a dozen allied Heavenly Axis Realm experts merged with their Dragon Bloodline demon spirits and stood in their way.</p><p>*Boom!* *Boom!* *Boom!*</p><p>A wall of dragon flames exploded. The raging flames danced in every direction.</p><p>Although the flames slightly injured the Heavenly Axis Realm experts, it wasn&#x2019;t enough to kill them.</p><p>*Woosh!* *Woosh!* *Woosh!*</p><p>Three licks of dragon flame passed through the gaps between the Heavenly Axis Realm experts&#x2019; defenses at crafty angles and shot towards the inscription patterns array.</p><p>A sinister expression was smeared across Gu Heng&#x2019;s face. If he couldn&#x2019;t cut Nie Li into ten thousand pieces, then he&#x2019;d never be able to ease the hatred in his heart. No matter what happened, he wouldn&#x2019;t let the Lightning Deity&#x2019;s Lake be destroyed, just like that!</p><p>Three tongues of dragon flame whistled towards the array below.</p><p>Nie Li stood in the face of those dragon flames, but didn&#x2019;t move an inch. His expression was calm. He quickly extended his hand and snatched the Deity Root.</p><p>*Boom!* *Boom!* *Boom!*</p><p>The three tongues of dragon flame exploded around him. One raging flame even caught on him.</p><p>A barrier quickly sprung up from his Grade 6 artifact and blocked the flames. Not even the slightest spark managed to touch Nie Li&#x2019;s skin.</p><p>He got the Deity Root!</p><p>The corner of Nie Li&#x2019;s mouth rose into a smile as he tossed the Deity Root into the Myriad Miles Rivers and Mountains Painting.</p><p>Since he already had the Deity Root, there was no longer a need to continue the battle.</p><p>Nie Li transmitted his voice over the Li Xingyun and Gu Bei. &#x201C;Brother Xingyun, Gu Bei, conserve our strength and order a retreat!&#x201D;</p><p>When Li Xingyun, Gu Bei, and the others heard Nie Li&#x2019;s words, they rejoiced. Nie Li had accomplished their objective, so why should they keep fighting? They should just let Gu Heng go and cry in a corner all on his own. Anyways, they weren&#x2019;t going to stay and play around with him any longer than they needed to!</p><p>&#x201C;Everyone, retreat!&#x201D; Gu Bei loudly yelled.</p><p>&#x201C;Follow me and charge out!&#x201D; Li Xingyun took the lead.</p><p>The experts of Heavenly Path League and Demon League all charged out of the seige.</p><p>Without its Deity Root, the Lightning Deity&#x2019;s Lake began to rapidly collapse.</p><p>At the sight of this, how could Gu Heng possibly not understand what was going on? He nearly cried out from the emotional pain. This Lightning Deity&#x2019;s Lake was his last remaining one! So what if he managed to wipe out Nie Li and his entire group? All three of his Deity&#x2019;s Lakes were gone, not a single one was left!</p><p>That goddamn bastard, Nie Li!</p><p>If he wanted a new Deity&#x2019;s Lake, then he&#x2019;d have to start a war with another faction! Furthermore, he wouldn&#x2019;t be able to find anything better than Heiyun, Guyu, and Lightning Deity&#x2019;s Lakes!</p><p>&#x201C;I&#x2019;ll slaughter you all!&#x201D; Gu Heng roared in rage and led his men to attack on all sides.</p><p>Nie Li, Xiao Yu, Lu Piao, and their men followed Li Xingyun and Gu Bei. The battle was simply too intense. Within moments, everyone got separated from each other in the clash.</p><p>Gu Heng pointed at Nie Li and yelled, &#x201C;Slaughter that kid and bring me his interspatial ring!&#x201D;</p><p>Nie Li definitely must have taken something from the Lightning Deity&#x2019;s Lake and placed it in his interspatial ring! Whatever it was, Gu Heng had to recover it!</p><p>A group of people surrounded Nie Li.</p><p>When Li Xingyun and Gu Bei saw this, they immediately led a few men to rescue him.</p><p>&#x201C;Don&#x2019;t worry about me! Just retreat!&#x201D; Nie Li immediately yelled. After all, the Deity Root wasn&#x2019;t in his interspatial ring; it was in his Myriad Miles Rivers and Mountains Painting.</p><p>At most, he&#x2019;d die here. But even if that happened, Gu Heng wouldn&#x2019;t be able to take back the Deity Root! At the very most, Nie Li would just have to stay within the Skysoul Institute for a period of time!</p><p>A group of Heavenly Axis Realm experts surrounded Nie Li.</p><p>*Boom!* *Boom!* *Boom!*</p><p>Explosions of energy landed on Nie Li&#x2019;s barrier and left cracks on it.</p><p>Once the Grade 6 armour&#x2019;s barrier was destroyed, Nie Li would definitely die. With his current strength, it wasn&#x2019;t possible for him to confront against a Heavenly Axis Realm expert.</p><p>&#x2018;I have to put the Grade 6 Armour into the Myriad Miles Rivers and Mountains Painting, before it&#x2019;s destroyed.&#x2019; Nie Li thought inwardly. He definitely couldn&#x2019;t allow the Grade 6 artifact armour to fall into Gu Heng&#x2019;s hands and benefit him!</p><p>A group of enemy Heavenly Axis Realm experts pounced towards Nie Li. Just as Nie Li was about to stow away his Grade 6 artifacts, Xiao Yu grabbed his arm.</p><p>&#x201C;Follow me!&#x201D; Xiao Yu anxiously said as he activated the inscription patterns array on the ring on his forefinger.</p><p>A mysterious blanket of light rapidly enveloped Nie Li and Xiao Yu. The ripple of time-space rapidly spread out around them.</p><p>Nie Li was secretly alarmed; he never thought that Xiao Yu&#x2019;s common-looking ring would actually be a Time-Space Artifact!</p><p>Gu Heng was startled by the sight and sense of that peculiar time-space ripple. He immediately barked, &#x201C;Quick, stop them!&#x201D;</p><p>A wave of dragon flames was aimed at Nie Li and Xiao Yu&#x2019;s direction.</p><p>One of the tongue of flames hit Xiao Yu, who groaned. However, the ring managed to fully activate in time. With a flash of light, the two of them disappeared.</p><p>Nie Li and Xiao Yu had actually escaped!</p><p>At the sight of this, Gu Heng&#x2019;s bloodshot eyes filled with an unparalleled viciousness and his lungs nearly burst. All three of his Deity&#x2019;s Lake had been destroyed, but he&#x2019;d actually allowed the culprit to escape?!</p><p></p><hr><p></p><p></p><p style="text-align: center"><strong>&gt;&lt;</strong></p><p></p>
