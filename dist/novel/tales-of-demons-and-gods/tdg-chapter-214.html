<p><strong>Chapter 214 - Unusual transformation</strong></p><p>Only by raising their strength quickly, they will able to have the sufficient capital to face the next crisis.</p><p>They are in the crucial point of their cultivation. If they were to stop midway, the effect would dramatically drop.</p><p>As Nie Li continued to cultivate, and absorbed even more soul force and powers of law, the Thunder God&#x2019;s Meteorite Sword emitted a magnificent light as it quietly suspended in front of him. It seems that the sword was also absorbing the surrounding energies.</p><p>When the Thunder God&#x2019;s Meteorite Sword absorbed the soul force and powers of law, it&#x2019;s like a vortex that constantly sucked the energies into it.</p><p>Nie Li suddenly felt the surrounding soul force and the powers of law becoming less rich and immediately got the Fanged Panda to absorb more demon spirits.</p><p>The Thunder God&#x2019;s Meteorite Sword unleashed some thunderbolts and there seems to be something moving inside those thunderbolts. With a sudden thought, Nie Li diverted his consciousness and scanned the Thunder God&#x2019;s Meteorite Sword. His consciousness was attracted to some weird energy and made a profound state.</p><p>At this moment, the Legend rank experts from the Wugui Family were trapped in the Ten Thousand Demonic Beast Array, and were unable to get out. Their ordinary experts were being slaughtered by Ye Mo. A Legend rank expert killing some ordinary experts, is like a tiger being placed together with a flock of sheep. With a wave of his hand, five to six Black Gold rank experts were nailed to the ground by the cloud of icicles, not to mention how gruesome it was for the Silver rank and the Gold rank experts.</p><p>While watching their men being killed, the Legend rank experts eyes reddened.</p><p>One of the Wugui Family&#x2019;s Legend rank experts coldly barked, &#x201C;Wu Yue, use the Divine Blood Forbidden Technique!&#x201D;</p><p>Wu Yue hesitated for a moment. By executing the Divine Blood Forbidden Technique, he can will be able to bring everyone out of this Ten Thousand Demonic Beast Array; however, after he executes it, his cultivation will suffer greatly.</p><p>&#x201C;If you don&#x2019;t use it now, we won&#x2019;t make it in time!&#x201D; the other Legend rank experts all barked.</p><p>While Wu Yue was hesitating, Ye Zong, who is in the center of the Ten Thousand Demonic Beast Array, had a chilling ray flash across his eyes as both of his hands formed into quick hand signs. The Ten Thousand Demonic Beast Array instantly underwent drastic changes. All of the Black Gold rank demon spirits energies gathered together and made a huge mountain that was pressing in from above.</p><p>As the majestic power dropped down on them, one of the Legend rank experts that was closest to it, tried to use his own strength to withstand it by raising his fist and swung it towards the mountain.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>An unparalleled power slammed into the body of the Legend rank expert and was overwhelming it.</p><p>&#x201C;How is this happening? Ah&#x2026;&#x2026;&#x201D; The Legend rank expert issued a mournful miserable shriek as his body exploded.</p><p>Bang! Bang! Bang!</p><p>Instantly, another three Legend rank bodies exploded.</p><p>The Ten Thousand Demonic Beast Array was so powerful that it could even kill Legend rank experts without any difficulty.</p><p>A total of eleven Legend rank experts charged into this Ten Thousand Demonic Beast Array without even understanding what this array is and three of them were killed by it, only eight left.</p><p>Seeing this scene, Wu Yue&#x2019;s eyes turned red. He understood that if he doesn&#x2019;t execute the Divine Blood Forbidden Technique, then they will all be buried here.</p><p>As he chanted the incantation, the pores on his body, legs, arms and dozens of other places leaked out blood that turned into a bloody mist that shrouded his body. His figure suddenly expanded and looked like a devil made from blood.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>&#x201C;Follow me!&#x201D; Wu Yue furiously roared as he turned into a streak of light, charging out of the Ten Thousand Demonic Beast Array.</p><p>The remaining seven Legend rank experts followed behind him.</p><p>Bang! Bang! Bang!</p><p>The moment the Black Gold rank demon spirits from the Ten Thousand Demonic Beast Array touched the bloody mist around Wu Yue&#x2019;s body, they exploded and turned into ashes.</p><p>Wu Yue frantically charged forward with no intention of stopping.</p><p>Seeing this scene, Ye Zong frowned his brows as his hands formed into a seal and slowly pushed them outwards.</p><p>Within the array, a huge hand formed out of thin air and headed towards Wu Yue.</p><p>Seeing the hand, Wu Yue did not dodge. Instead, he raised the sword in his hand and headed towards the huge hand.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>The sword in Wu Yue&#x2019;s hand was instantly destroyed, but he managed to penetrate the huge hand, making a hole, as he charged out of the Ten Thousand Demonic Beast Array. The seven experts followed behind Wu Yue and exited the array.</p><p>&#x2018;Never imagined that he would actually be able to escape!&#x2019; Ye Zong was depressed in his heart. He still wasn&#x2019;t that proficient with the Ten Thousand Demonic Beast Array, which is why Wu Yue managed to escape. Furthermore, that forbidden technique that Wu Yue executed is very powerful, he managed to reach a Demigod rank&#x2019;s strength in that instant, which caused the array to be unable to stop him in that moment.</p><p>However, after charging out of the array, Wu Yue spat out a mouthful of blood as his body quickly shrank back to its original size. In order to charge out, he had to execute a forbidden technique of the Wugui Family, which caused his cultivation to suffer for a lifetime. Furthermore, the confrontation with the array gave him heavy injuries, which he might not be able to recover from for the next few years.</p><p>One of the seven Legend rank experts came out and carried Wu Yue.</p><p>The leader of the group turned his head back and looked at Ye Zong, who was in the center of the array, and said in a voice overflowing with rage, &#x201C;Today, we of the Wugui Family have been tricked by your Glory City. We will definitely get you back from this matter in the future! This damned array can protect you guys for this moment, but not for a lifetime! The next time I come, I will kill you all and bury you with my dead brothers!&#x201D;</p><p>Ye Zong coldly stared at the Wugui Family&#x2019;s experts in the sky and snorted, &#x201C;This time, it&#x2019;s only a small lesson for you guys. If you dare to come again, I&#x2019;ll make sure all of you die here! If you want to swallow my Glory City up, that will have to depend on whether or not you&#x2019;re capable enough to do so!&#x201D;</p><p>The Wugui Family&#x2019;s Legend rank experts carried the wounded as they covered the rest and retreated.</p><p>Never chase a cornered enemy. Afterall, they still have seven Legend rank experts remaining. Even if Ye Mo, Ye Zong and the rest chased after them, it&#x2019;s impossible to make them to stay!</p><p>The Wugui Family&#x2019;s army retreated like tidal wave. This first confrontation did not last very long and the Wugui Family has suffered a great loss. However, some of Glory City&#x2019;s trump cards have also been exposed. The array probably won&#x2019;t be that effective anymore.</p><p>While watching the Wugui Family&#x2019;s experts leaving, an even stronger anxiety rose within Ye Zong&#x2019;s heart. This time, the Wugui Family only sent one force to scout the place. They thought that this amount of Legend rank experts would be be enough to take down Glory City. However, they didn&#x2019;t have anything to use to guard against the Ten Thousand Demonic Beast Array and, therefore, fell into the trap. The second round of the Wugui Family&#x2019;s attack probably won&#x2019;t be that easy anymore.</p><p>However, the good news is that they made the first batch retreat. The second batch from the Wugui Family won&#x2019;t come for another two months. Glory City will at least have enough time to make preparations for them.</p><p>After obtaining some information from Ye Mo, within the fifteen cities of the Nether Realm, only the Wugui Family and the Dark Guild are aware of Glory City&#x2019;s existence. These two forces treat Glory City as if it&#x2019;s their property and aren&#x2019;t willing to share it with others. This is why the location of Glory City hasn&#x2019;t been leaked out.</p><p>If it was leaked out, even more forces from the fifteen cities of the Nether Realm would come and, at that time, Glory City will be in even more danger.</p><p>For now, they have managed to deal with the Wugui Family. The future matters could be left to the future to deal with.</p><p>Nie Li&#x2019;s consciousness entered the Thunder God&#x2019;s Meteorite Sword and was experiencing some profound notions. After seeing the concentrated lightning filling the endless void, there seems to be something vaguely mysterious concealed within the lightning. His conscious tried to penetrate through the lightning. Suddenly, a explosion sounded and lightning landed on Nie Li&#x2019;s consciousness.</p><p>While being struck by that lightning, Nie Li felt pain course throughout his entire body as though he was going to explode.</p><p>This is the kind of pain could be felt deep within his soul.</p><p>Nie Li tried to withdraw his consciousness but realised that it was completely surrounded by lightning.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>The intensive lightning continued to strike Nie Li&#x2019;s consciousness as though it&#x2019;s trying to shatter his soul.</p><p>Tssss!</p><p>The pain caused Nie Li to painfully inhale a breath of cold air. Nie Li tried to forcefully pull back his conscious; however, that attractive force forcefully latched onto his conscious.</p><p>The power in the Thunder God&#x2019;s Meteorite Sword doesn&#x2019;t seem to be coming from this world.</p><p>When he got struck by the lightning, he vaguely felt that these lightning strikes were coursing through his consciousness and into his soul realm. Originally, these lightning strikes were preparing to destroy his soul realm, but were suddenly attracted to the vine in his soul realm. They streaked through his soul realm and disappeared.</p><p>Although he forcefully endured the pain, he still felt miraculous changes. He tried to lure the lightning to the vine in his soul realm.</p><p>At this moment, Ye Ziyun, Xiao Ning&#x2019;er, Duan Jian and the other seven inside the inscription pattern array felt a bizarre energy penetrating their soul realms. They could vaguely see the rattling lightning energy. It seems to be trying to tear their soul realms to shreds.</p><p>This is the energy released by the Thunder God&#x2019;s Meteorite Sword. Even if it&#x2019;s just a trace of it, it was enough to affect Ye Ziyun and the rest.</p><p>They immediately condensed their soul force, summoned their demon spirits and started to fight it.</p><p>As the inscription pattern array revolved even faster, the luster unleashed from it were dazzling to the eyes. The inscription patterns on the array underwent drastic changes and strange lines appeared around it.</p><p>Goddess Yu Yan, who was floating in the air, saw this scene and was utterly astonished. She has never seen an inscription pattern array that could transform on its own and turn into an even more profound array. Furthermore, the aura unleashed from the Thunder God&#x2019;s Meteorite Sword caused even her to feel fear.</p><p>The purity of this energy has far surpassed the power of law!</p><p>After seeing that special huge sword, Yu Yan suddenly remembered something and was shocked, &#x201C;Isn&#x2019;t this sword the Thunder Spiritual God&#x2019;s sword? It&#x2019;s said that even the Thunder Spiritual God couldn&#x2019;t completely control this sword. Thereafter, when the Thunder Spiritual God&#x2019;s Divine Spark shattered, this sword couldn&#x2019;t be found anywhere. I never imagined that this sword was in Nie Li&#x2019;s possession.&#x201D;</p><p>This mysterious Thunder God&#x2019;s Meteorite Sword is something so profound that even the Thunder Spiritual God of that time couldn&#x2019;t understand it! It&#x2019;s said that this sword was forged from a meteor, and isn&#x2019;t something that belongs to this world.</p><p>After seeing the new mysterious inscription pattern array shrouding Nie Li and the other ten, the doubts in Yu Yan&#x2019;s heart grew even more. She doesn&#x2019;t know if she should pull Nie Li and the others out. Just what will this inscription pattern array bring to Nie Li?</p><p>The entire inscription pattern array was bursting out with dazzling lustrous light as it shot into a sky, like a huge divine pillar.</p><p>Nie Li knitted his brows as he felt the lightning in his soul realm become similar to a spider web that was starting to spread throughout his soul realm. As he tried to see where the lightning was spreading to, Nie Li realised that a figure suddenly appeared within his soul realm. The figure was Ye Ziyun and she is quietly sitting as though she had been enveloped by the lightning&#x2019;s power.</p><p>This sudden scene caused Nie Li to be stunned for a moment. Why did Ye Ziyun appear in his soul realm when it was reaching its limit?</p><p></p><hr><p></p>
