<p><strong>Chapter 220 - Legend rank expert?</strong></p><p>After listening Nie Li, Li Heng&#x2019;s eyes lit up as he cupped his hands and said, &#x201C;Since young master still has other matters to attend to, then forget it. If you could tell us how to leave this Abyss Prison Realm, we, the twelve families, will be endlessly grateful!&#x201D;</p><p>Nie Li nodded his head. He&#x2019;s thinking of getting Ye Mo and Ye Zong to personally come to discuss this with the twelve families. After all, with so many families here, if they really do shift to Glory City, it&#x2019;ll be a major problem on how to make arrangements for them.</p><p>Although Glory City&#x2019;s threat has yet to be vanquished, the families in Abyss Prison Realm will still move forward. After all, the living environment in the Abyss Prison Realm is too harsh, completely no match for Glory City&#x2019;s.</p><p>Matters like these would naturally fall to Ye Mo and Ye Zong&#x2019;s hands.</p><p>After bidding farewell to Li Heng, together with Duan Jian and Yu Yan, they left the Abyss Prison Realm.</p><p>At this moment, on the far mountain.</p><p>As Nie Li and Duan Jian&#x2019;s figures moved further and further away, a tattered old man sat there with rays of light shooting from his eyes as he watched Nie Li and the others leave.</p><p>At this moment, he no longer had any insane looks. Although his clothes were tattered, it couldn&#x2019;t cover up that sharp blade-like aura. This aura even caused the surrounding trees to tremble.</p><p>After thinking of something, he mumbled, &#x201C;I wonder to what degree you have comprehended that truth?&#x201D;</p><p>There wasn&#x2019;t any expression on his face. A moment later, he closed his eyes and continued to cultivate.</p><p>Even after skimming through the Abyss Prison Realm for dozens of minutes, Nie Li still felt that a gaze was staring at him from the darkness, causing him to be extremely careful. After several hours, the feeling finally disappeared and he silently breathed out in relief.</p><p>Nie Li can sense that that old man is definitely someone difficult to deal with. In the future, he&#x2019;ll hide from him as much as he can.</p><p>Nie Li and his group returned to the ancient teleportation array and entered it.</p><p>Glory City</p><p>The engagement news of Nie Li and Ye Ziyun caused many from various families to be dejected. However, it has also brought a joyous atmosphere to Glory City, more or less.</p><p>The current Nie Li is the future hope of Glory City and everyone has great expectations of him.</p><p>Now that Duan Jian&#x2019;s matter is settled, their next move is to head for the Nether Realm. After carefully thinking it through, he decided to bring Ye Ziyun, Xiao Ning&#x2019;er, Du Ze, Lu Piao and the rest along. As for Xiao Yu, she&#x2019;ll be remaining in Glory City as she is still too young.</p><p>Since Duan Jian had reached Legend rank, through the effect of the Soul Array, it will allow the others to rapidly speed up their cultivation to the next rank as well. If they could all reach Legend rank, then even if they encounter some danger, they&#x2019;ll have the capability to deal with them.</p><p>Since Nie Li has formed a Soul Array with Ye Ziyun, Xiao Ning&#x2019;er and the rest, their strength will have a substantial increase in battle. Add the fact that Yu Yan is with them, then even if a Legend rank pinnacle expert or even a Demigod rank comes, Nie Li reckons that they will have the ability to protect themselves.</p><p>Furthermore, the Soul Array allows them to sense each other&#x2019;s position and, henceforth, makes sure that they are safe.</p><p>Among the ten people, no matter who it is, if they could obtain the Master of the Nether Realm&#x2019;s favor, then they will be able to help Glory City ride through this crisis.</p><p>After receiving Nie Li&#x2019;s notice, Ye Ziyun, Xiao Ning&#x2019;er, Du Ze, Lu Piao and the rest gathered at Ye Ziyun&#x2019;s yard.</p><p>&#x201C;Nie Li, I suddenly felt a powerful power of law enter into my soul realm. Did someone among us break through into Legend rank?&#x201D; Du Ze curiously asked.</p><p>&#x201C;Yeah, Duan Jian and I have made a trip to the Abyss Prison Realm and he reached Legend.&#x201D; Nie Li nodded his head and told them everything that happened.</p><p>It turns out that Nie Li and Duan Jian have already entered the Abyss Prison Realm. They all never thought that Duan Jian would be able to actually breakthrough into Legend rank. Now that they have all formed the Soul Array, the refining energy from Duan Jian after his breakthrough will slip into the other&#x2019;s soul realms through the array and cause them to press forward as well.</p><p>&#x201C;Nie Li, you guys made a trip to the Abyss Prison Realm and did not even tell us a word before leaving!&#x201D; Lu Piao said in depression, &#x201C;I could almost hatch an egg from training here!&#x201D;</p><p>Nie Li shrugged and said, &#x201C;Forget about the Abyss Prison Realm. I&#x2019;m going to bring you guys to a more interesting place.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;What kind of place?&#x201D; Lu Piao&#x2019;s eyes lit up.</p><p>Everyone had expressions of curiosity on their faces.</p><p>Nie Li looked at Lu Piao and said with a light smile, &#x201C;Nether Realm, Nine-Layered Deathlands!&#x201D;</p><p>Seeing Nie Li&#x2019;s meaningful expression, Lu Piao felt a wave of chilling intent rising from his back.</p><p>&#x201C;Is that place dangerous? If it&#x2019;s too dangerous, then I&#x2019;m not going.&#x201D; Lu Piao winced his head.</p><p>&#x201C;Are you even a man!&#x201D; Xiao Xue snorted as she gave Lu Piao a kick.</p><p>&#x201C;Who says I&#x2019;m not a man?! I&#x2019;ll go then, no big deal!&#x201D; Lu Piao snorted.</p><p>Nie Li glanced at Ye Ziyun. Since it looked like she seemed to have thought of something, both of her cheeks turned red as she turned her head around. Looking at Xiao Ning&#x2019;er, she had sadness flash across her eyes and she lowered her head. As the atmosphere turned a little awkward, Nie Li couldn&#x2019;t help rubbing his nose.</p><p>From today onwards, Ye Ziyun is his fianc&#xE9;e.</p><p>Truth is that in Nie Li&#x2019;s heart, he&#x2019;s very happy about it. He feels like embracing Ye Ziyun, but with so many of his friends here, he didn&#x2019;t say anything.</p><p>Du Ze, Lu Piao and the rest all had a meaningful smile on their face as they looked at Nie Li.</p><p>&#x201C;Nie Li, you&#x2019;re formidable! Having Goddess Ziyun in your hands so quickly. Furthermore, it&#x2019;s settled by Lord Ye Mo and Lord Ye Zong!&#x201D; Lu Piao had a meaningful smile as he poked Nie Li while speaking softly in his ears.</p><p>Nie Li coughed and said, &#x201C;Okay, all of you go and get prepared. We&#x2019;ll leave tomorrow morning. Oh, and Ziyun, go notify Lord Ye Mo and Ye Zong. Tell them that if they have time, make a visit to the Abyss Prison Realm and shift the families there to Glory City.&#x201D;</p><p>Of those families, the strongest is just a Legend rank Fighter. Compared to Ye Zong and Ye Mo, who are Legend rank Demon Spiritualists, there&#x2019;s a huge gap between them. Therefore, Ye Mo and Ye Zong should be able to handle those families.</p><p>&#x201C;Okay.&#x201D; Ye Ziyun nodded her head.</p><p>Nie Li looked into the distance. Now that they are heading for the Nine-Layered Deathlands, he&#x2019;ll have to go and bid farewell to his family.</p><p>Du Ze, Lu Piao and the rest couldn&#x2019;t help going into silence for a moment, since they were also going to bid farewell to their families.</p><p>Although they have no idea what kind of place the Nine-Layered Deathlands is like, it should be somewhere extremely dangerous. But because of the Soul Array, they will soon step into Legend rank. If they continue to remain in Glory City, not only will their strength be stagnated, they will also not be able to protect Glory City. They can only head to a further place and get stronger!</p><p>&#x201C;Okay then, we&#x2019;ll meet tomorrow morning!&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Okay, see you tomorrow morning!&#x201D; said Wei Nan and the rest.</p><p>The nine of them returned to their respective homes while Nie Li brought Duan Jian and Yu Yan back to the Heavenly Marks Family.</p><p>Heavenly Marks Family</p><p>The location of the current Heavenly Marks Family is not far from the City Lord&#x2019;s Mansion, which is in the center of Glory City. With a huge home, his clansmen are all staying here to cultivate without any worries. The fortune that Nie Li has granted them is something they won&#x2019;t be able to spend even after several generation.</p><p>As Nie Li walked in, he saw the younger generations of the Heavenly Marks Family training. The moment they saw Nie Li, they immediately stood straight, appearing to be very respectful.</p><p>Right now, Nie Li has become a god-like existence in the Heavenly Marks Family. Although Nie Li is often not at home, they would occasionally hear the news of him. Their hearts are filled with respect for him.</p><p>&#x201C;Big Brother Nie Li!&#x201D; The moment Nie Yu saw Nie Li, she excitedly ran towards him. Right now, she has become the strongest among Heavenly Marks Family, second to Nie Li. Usually, aside from cultivating, she would give guidance to the other members in their cultivation.</p><p>&#x201C;Xiao Yu.&#x201D; Nie Li smiled as he rubbed Nie Yu&#x2019;s head.</p><p>Nie Yu pursed her lips and smiled. She enjoyed being close to him.</p><p>Nie Li looked at Nie Yu and said, &#x201C;Tomorrow, I will leave for training.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Then, can I come along?&#x201D; Nie Yu blinked her big eyes as she looked at Nie Li.</p><p>&#x201C;No, you&#x2019;re still too young.&#x201D; Nie Li said as he shook his head.</p><p>&#x201C;Okay.&#x201D; Hearing Nie Li&#x2019;s words, Nie Yu immediately had a disappointed expression on her face.</p><p>&#x201C;Right now, Niu Yu is the strongest in the Heavenly Marks Family, aside from me. When I&#x2019;m not here, the Heavenly Marks Family will need you to protect it!&#x201D; Nie Li seriously said to Nie Yu.</p><p>Nie Yu nodded her head upon hearing Nie Li&#x2019;s words, &#x201C;Okay, I will definitely protect our family!&#x201D;</p><p>Nie Li waved his hands to those people from the Heavenly Marks Family and then went with Nie Yu back to his home.</p><p>As they watched Nie Li&#x2019;s back figure disappear, discussions burst out among them.</p><p>&#x201C;What do you think is Big Brother Nie Li&#x2019;s cultivation?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;No idea, even little sister Nie Yu has reached Black Gold rank. Who knows? Maybe Big Brother Nie Li stepped into Legend rank!&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Legend rank!&#x201D; Many people had their eyes open wide. Legend rank has always been an unimaginable realm for them. They are all filled with respect and admiration for Nie Li. Who knows when they could touch such a realm.</p><p>&#x201C;Big Brother Nie Li and sister-in-law Ziyun are engaged. It&#x2019;s said that sister-in-law Ziyun is very pretty, the most beautiful woman in Glory City!&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;You bunch of brats, continue your cultivation! If you guys can reach Black Gold rank like Nie Yu in your lifetime, I&#x2019;ll be satisfied!&#x201D; Someone scolded.</p><p>They immediately stood at position and continued to train.</p><p>Heavenly Marks Family&#x2019;s main hall</p><p>After receiving the new of Nie Li&#x2019;s return, Nie Hai, Nie En and his father, Nie Ming all came.</p><p>&#x201C;Nie Li, you&#x2019;re going out to train?&#x201D; Nie Ming asked Nie Li.</p><p>&#x201C;Yes, father.&#x201D; Nie Li nodded.</p><p>Nie Ming looked at Nie Li and said while sighing, &#x201C;Kids all grow up eventually. One day, they will have to fly from the nest. I won&#x2019;t stop you, take care of yourself out there.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Yes father, I understand.&#x201D; Noticing the wrinkles at the corner of his father&#x2019;s eyes, Nie Li felt his nose turning slightly sour. However, he endured it and smiled, &#x201C;I will return shortly. Father doesn&#x2019;t have to be worried about me. Furthermore, I will soon step into the realm of Legend rank!&#x201D;</p><p>Legend rank? Hearing Nie Li&#x2019;s words, Nie En and Nie Hai couldn&#x2019;t help widening their mouths. They had once guessed Nie Li&#x2019;s strength and felt that it&#x2019;s highly possible for him to step into Legend rank. However, hearing it personally from Nie Li, they were still shocked in their hearts.</p><p>Is the Heavenly Marks Family finally going to have a Legend rank expert?</p><p></p><hr><p></p>
