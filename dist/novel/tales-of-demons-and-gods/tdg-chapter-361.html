<p><strong>Chapter 361 - Assassin?</strong></p><p>5-fate!</p><p>Nie Li could sensed that the Bloodwing Saint Jiao-dragon&#x2019;s physique had also been strengthened by a lot.</p><p>Now that he&#x2019;d reached 5-fate, there were five fate souls floating within his soul realm, revolving nonstop. That fifth fate soul constantly provided him with Heavenly Energy.</p><p>Now, Guo Huai was extremely disheartened. He&#x2019;d executed so many Wind Cannons that he&#x2019;d nearly exhausted all of his Heavenly Energy.</p><p>However, he still couldn&#x2019;t get rid of Nie Li. He never thought that his actions would allow Nie Li to reach 5-fate. The badly wounded physique of the Bloodwing Saint Jiao-dragon was already fully recovered.</p><p>Guo Huai furiously roared as he leapt and pounced at Nie Li. He swiped his huge palm towards Nie Li&#x2019;s head.</p><p>He absolutely couldn&#x2019;t allow Nie Li to fully grasp the power of 5-fate!</p><p>Long Yuyin and Xiao Yu couldn&#x2019;t help to shouting at the same time, &#x201C;Be careful!&#x201D;</p><p>Just as the Nethermoon Draconic Beast&#x2019;s huge palm was about to land on Nie Li&#x2019;s head, Nie Li suddenly opened his eyes as a sharp ray of light flashed through them.</p><p>Usually, a person would need several hours to fully grasp their power upon reaching 5-fate. However, that wasn&#x2019;t the case for Nie Li. After reaching 5-fate, he quickly activated the [Heavenly God] cultivation technique to hasten the development of his fifth fate soul. Through various methods, he&#x2019;d already fully grasped the power of 5-fate.</p><p>How could he be that fast? Guo Huai saw Nie Li open his eyes and his heart shook.</p><p>It was already too late for Guo Huai to react. Nie Li let out a deep roar, shook his wings, tilted his body, and mercilessly charged towards the Nethermoon Draconic Beast with his back[1. Nie Li most likely body-slammed Guo Huai with his side, but was tilted enough so that the spikes on his back/side area could reach. Hope that helps.].</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>A heavy noise sounded as the two huge beasts collided.</p><p>The students of the East District felt their scalps tingle at the scene. Nie Li had used his back spikes to ram the Nethermoon Draconic Beast!</p><p>The Nethermoon Draconic Beast had issued a horrific scream. It&#x2019;d been pierced by hundreds of spikes, and every single one of them was extremely sharp and left a deep bloody hole in it&#x2019;s body. Fresh blood poured from the wounds.</p><p>Guo Huai miserably shrieked. He thoroughly hated Nie Li and his Bloodwing Saint Jiao-dragon. From that collision, the Nethermoon Draconic Beast&#x2019;s body was filled with bloody holes. He felt pain from every single one of them!</p><p>Before Guo Huai could react, Nie Li furiously roared and charged at the Nethermoon Draconic Beast again.</p><p>*Boom!* *Boom!* *Boom!*</p><p>Energies exploded on the stage as the Nethermoon Draconic Beast continued getting rammed by the Bloodwing Saint Jiao-dragon and wailed even more miserably.</p><p>For the Nethermoon Draconic Beast, this experience was even worse than Hell!</p><p>Now that he&apos;d reached 5-fate, Nie Li had grasped two more of the Bloodwing Saint Jiao-dragon&#x2019;s combat abilities. However, he didn&#x2019;t plan to display them, since he could already win against Guo Huai with what he&#x2019;d already shown. He&#x2019;d already displayed sufficient talent, so he could keep those two combat abilities as hidden trump cards.</p><p>After experiencing all sorts of events in his previous life, Nie Li had learned an important lesson; no matter what happened, he always had to conceal some cards. Those without hidden trump cards died too easily.</p><p>Thanks to Nie Li&#x2019;s furious ramming, the Nethermoon Draconic Beast was sent flying. When he landed on the ground some distance away, he remained there, completely bloodied and unable to stand.</p><p>Venerable Flameless never expected Guo Huai to lose. He was furiously enraged in his heart as he scolded, &#x201C;Trash!&#x201D;</p><p>Now that the Nethermoon Draconic Beast could no longer stand, Nie Li rapidly withdrew the Bloodwing Saint Jiao-dragon, shrank back to his human form, and leapt off the stage. He turn to Venerable Flameless, Huang Yu, and Nanmen Tianhai, and asked, &#x201C;Two Elders, I&#x2019;ve already won your two battles. The test should be over, right?&#x201D;</p><p>Students of the East District weren&#x2019;t able snap out of it for quite some time.</p><p>As a newcomer, he&#x2019;d actually managed to defeat so many experts of the East District and directly enter the top two hundred ranks. Something like this definitely hadn&#x2019;t happened for hundreds of years!</p><p>Nie Li&#x2019;s talent was indeed shocking, especially that mutated Dragon Bloodline God Level demon spirit of his. It left everyone with a deep impression.</p><p>&#x201C;Nie Li has managed to win against two Senior Brothers. His test for today shall come to an end here!&#x201D; Huang Yu laughed as he looked at Venerable Flameless, who sat beside him. &#x201C;I wonder what opinions Venerable Flameless might have on the matter?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Leave it, then!&#x201D; Venerable Flameless said in a low voice as he swept an eye over Nie Li. His plots against Nie Li haven&apos;t succeeded this time, and it&#x2019;d definitely be harder for him to do so in the future. He still wasn&apos;t resigned to it, but there was nothing he could do. He knew that Hierarch Skycloud had probably noticed what was going on. He no longer had a chance here; therefore, he could only leave things as they were.</p><p>After Nie Li had finished, Lu Piao, Gu Bei, and the rest also went up to challenge some Senior Brothers.</p><p>Although Lu Piao and Gu Bei&#x2019;s performances were extremely outstanding, thanks to Nie Li&#x2019;s performance before them, the students of the East District weren&#x2019;t in as much of a shock as they would&#x2019;ve been.</p><p>From this day onwards, Nie Li was a disciple of the East District. However, his aim was to enter the Central District as soon as possible and quickly grasp the power and a position within the Divine Feathers Sect. He didn&#x2019;t have any more idle time!</p><p>The competition ended and the crowd on the field slowly dispersed.</p><p>The news that Nie Li had entered the East District&#x2019;s top two hundred from the moment he entered quickly spread throughout the Skysoul Institute. The news also gradually spread throughout the rest of the Divine Feathers Sect and the other disciples started to pay attention to the rising genius.</p><p>After his battle with Guo Huai, Nie Li stopped receiving transmissions from Hierarch Skycloud and had no idea what his views were on the matter. Either way, if Hierarch Skycloud had something to say, then he&#x2019;d definitely send someone with summons for Nie Li. Since Nie Li had just entered 5-fate, he had to resume cultivating as soon as possible to consolidate his cultivation.</p><p>As for Li Xingyun, Lu Piao and Gu Bei, they went on to carry out their plan. Recently, there&#x2019;d been a steady influx of geniuses joining both the Demon and Heavenly Path Leagues. Aside from the Demon League&#x2019;s generous treatment of its members, Nie Li&#x2019;s name caused a huge effect.</p><p>With a talent like Nie Li&#x2019;s, who knew how high he&#x2019;d grow in the future? Following Nie Li was definitely a commitment with prospects!</p><p>The night gradually darkened.</p><p>Nie Li continued his cultivation, as usual, and his fate soul had finally stabilised. Tomorrow, he&#x2019;d be able to store his fate soul in the Soul Hall and head out again to the outside world. Things would be much safer for him, after he placed his fate soul in the Soul Hall.</p><p>Nie Li quietly sat, enshrouded by a powerful aura. He&#x2019;d already finished cultivating the first few lines of the [Heavenly God] technique&#x2019;s first chapter! He didn&#x2019;t know when he&#x2019;d finish the entirety of the first chapter.</p><p>He quietly meditated on the profound intents contained in the [Heavenly God] cultivation technique. Insights flitted across his heart.</p><p>Just when he was about to enter the Myriad Miles Rivers and Mountains Painting, he suddenly sensed a peculiar aura. He immediately put away the Myriad Miles Rivers and Mountains Painting and looked at the door with alertness.</p><p>A strong wind blew through and forced the door open.</p><p>&#x201C;Who&#x2019;s there?&#x201D; Nie Li coldly barked as he peered outside. It was dark out there, without the shadow of a single person.</p><p>Nie Li sensed imminent danger. There was no way that the wind could just blow open the door like that and he couldn&#x2019;t see anyone outside, nor could he sense the trace of anyone nearby. This proved that the other party possessed strength that far surpassed his own. He had no idea where the other party was hiding themselves. Nie Li mobilised his Heavenly Energy and prepared to engage in battle.</p><p>Could it be&#x2026;?</p><p>Had Venerable Flameless sent assassins over?</p><p>With a flick of his right hand, the Thunder God&#x2019;s Meteorite Sword appeared, as well as his Grade 6 Artifacts. But even so, Nie Li couldn&#x2019;t sense the slightest thing. Just what kind of realm was his opponent in?</p><p></p><hr><p></p><p></p><p style="text-align: center"><strong>&gt;&lt;</strong></p><p></p>
