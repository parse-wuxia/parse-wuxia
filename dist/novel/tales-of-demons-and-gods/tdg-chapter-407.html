<p><strong>Chapter 407 - Out of Options</strong></p><p>When they saw the scene before them, those who were still planning to bluff their way out began trembling in fear.</p><p>If they wanted to leave, then the only way was to obediently hand over their treasures!</p><p>Wu Yazi flew around with furrowed brows, searching for Nie Li and Xiao Yu. This Hierarch Blacknether was being extremely difficult. Of all the people in the Demon God&#x2019;s Sect, he was the one who Wu Yazi wanted to encounter the least. This thought lowered his spirits. Even if he managed to kill Nie Li and take his treasures, those treasures would probably end up in Hierarch Blacknether&#x2019;s hands.</p><p>He&#x2019;d even have to give up all the treasures he&#x2019;d obtained for himself!</p><p>So in the end, he&#x2019;d have to return empty-handed, having gained nothing?</p><p>He was extremely dejected. He was still unwilling to resign!</p><p>As he flew along, he ran into two figures flying out of the palace: Nie Li and Yan Yang. Nie Li had already returned to his human form.</p><p>Wu Yazi twitched his brows, then placed himself in their path. He stared at Nie Li and proclaimed, &#x201C;Nie Li, we meet again!&#x201D;</p><p>Yan Yang and Nie Li paused their steps. Yan Yang glanced at Nie Li and transmitted, &#x201C;Who&#x2019;s this guy? Should I kill him?&#x201D;</p><p>Nie Li considered the situation for a moment, then shook his head and said, &#x201C;No need for that!&#x201D;</p><p>Wu Yazi looked at Yan Yang with his guard on full alert. He&#x2019;d already seen Yan Yang&#x2019;s strength. If Yan Yang chose to interferes, Wu Yazi knew he wasn&#x2019;t Yan Yang&#x2019;s opponent.</p><p>Nie Li lightly smiled, &#x201C;Brother Wu Yazi, our deal is complete. We&#x2019;ll go our separate ways now. I hope that next time we meet, it won&#x2019;t be as enemies!&#x201D;</p><p>Wu Yazi swept an eye over his surroundings with question marks in his heart. Why wasn&#x2019;t Xiao Yu with Nie Li? Could he have somehow offended Nie Li? Nie Li hadn&#x2019;t brought him out of the stone array; could Xiao Yu have died in there?</p><p>Wu Yazi looked at Nie Li and said, &#x201C;We had a pact earlier. We said that we&#x2019;d split all the treasures we found. But I haven&#x2019;t received my share!&#x201D;</p><p>Nie Li smiled bitterly and spread out his hands. &#x201C;What&#x2019;s the point in arguing about that? One of your Martial Ancestor Realm experts has already taken control of this palace. Even if I gave you the treasures, you wouldn&#x2019;t be able to sneak them out!&#x201D;</p><p>Wu Yazi raised his eyebrows. &#x201C;You don&#x2019;t have to worry about that!&#x201D;</p><p>Nie Li indifferently replied, &#x201C;This isn&#x2019;t as you think. I didn&#x2019;t take any treasures from the palace. Even if you searched me, there&#x2019;s nothing I can give!&#x201D;</p><p>Nie Li definitely wouldn&#x2019;t allow Wu Yazi to search him. After all, Wu Yazi had seen Nie Li take those treasures with his own eyes. If the interspatial ring was empty, then Wu Yazi would definitely be suspicious.</p><p>&#x201C;As if I&#x2019;d believe you!&#x201D; Wu Yazi felt extremely depressed. All this time, Wu Yazi had believed himself to have control over everything; only now did he realise that Nie Li had already made counter-preparations. And Nie Li had an expert like Yan Yang next to him. There was nothing that Wu Yazi could do to Nie Li.</p><p>Was he going to let Nie Li bring the Demon Blood Sacrifice with him, out of the palace?</p><p>Wu Yazi glanced at Yan Yang and transmitted his voice to Nie Li. &#x201C;I&#x2019;ll forego the treasures you have. But I want you to return the power of the Demon Blood Sacrifice!&#x201D;</p><p>He tried to think of ways he could kill Nie Li before Yan Yang could react.</p><p>However, Yan Yang&#x2019;s cold stare told him that he wouldn&#x2019;t have that chance to do so.</p><p>Nie Li looked at Wu Yazi and said, &#x201C;It&#x2019;s impossible for me to return the Demon Blood Sacrifice. If you want to keep me from leaving the Void Illusionary Divine Palace, then why don&#x2019;t we have a talk with Hierarch Blacknether or the Holy Son Li Huo?&#x201D;</p><p>Nie Li already had his fingers around Wu Yazi&#x2019;s Achilles Heel.</p><p>Wu Yazi&#x2019;s face turned ashen grey. Going to Hierarch Blacknether or the Holy Son Li Huo and having a talk? Wasn&#x2019;t that he same as seeking death?</p><p>If either of them found out that he&#x2019;d given the Demon Blood Sacrifice to a human, then the only option left for him would be death.</p><p>Nie Li transmitted his voice to Wu Yazi. &#x201C;I know what you&#x2019;re thinking. You&#x2019;re probably thinking about how to kill me. You know that even though I have Yan Yang, you still have a chance. You can even find someone stronger than Yan Yang to do the job for you. But don&#x2019;t you find it strange? Where is Xiao Yu? Xiao Yu has safely left the palace with my arrangements. Why don&#x2019;t we both keep our mouths shut? Let&#x2019;s pretend nothing happened and mind our own business from now on. But if you insist on provoking trouble, then you might get a life and death struggle!&#x201D;</p><p>Even though Yan Yang didn&#x2019;t have a clue as to what they were talking about, he could tell from Wu Yazi&#x2019;s expression that Nie Li was negotiating with him.</p><p>Wu Yazi fixed his eyes on Nie Li. &#x201C;That&#x2019;s impossible! Hierarch Blacknether has already taken over the entire Void Illusionary Divine Palace. There&#x2019;s no way you could&#x2019;ve sent Xiao Yu out. Besides, if you had a way to get out, then why are you still here?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Impossible? There&#x2019;s nothing that&#x2019;s impossible!&#x201D; Nie Li looked at Wu Yazi with a smile that wasn&#x2019;t a smile.</p><p>Wu Yazi recalled all of Nie Li&#x2019;s miracles and felt himself torn. If Xiao Yu really had escaped, then Wu Yazi would meet a rather tragic end, even if he took Nie Li with him.</p><p>&#x201C;You said that from now on, we&#x2019;ll mind our own business?&#x201D; Wu Yazi looked at Nie Li. Leaving Nie Li alive was a huge risk for Wu Yazi, but he&#x2019;d have to tolerate it.</p><p>&#x201C;That&#x2019;s right.&#x201D; Nie Li nodded.</p><p>Wu Yazi rolled his eyes and nodded, &#x201C;Fine!&#x201D;</p><p>Nie Li looked at him again with that &#x201C;smiling&#x201D; expression. &#x201C;Don&#x2019;t think of using Hierarch Blacknethe to kill me, either. Either way, if I don&#x2019;t get back alive, I&#x2019;ll let Xiao Yu spread the news about the Demon Blood Sacrifice. Go ahead and test it, if you like!&#x201D;</p><p>Wu Yazi felt extremely depressed. Nie Li had seen through every idea that&#x2019;d flashed through his mind.</p><p>&#x201C;Do whatever you want! Either way, if I die, you won&#x2019;t be any better off. The demon clans will definitely do all they can to kill any humans who&#x2019;ve received the Demon Blood Sacrifice! If I confess, then you two won&#x2019;t be able to find a place to live, even if you run to the ends of the earth! Your sects won&#x2019;t be able to protect you!&#x201D; Wu Yazi coldly snorted as he turned around. What the eyes don&#x2019;t see, the heart doesn&#x2019;t grieve over.</p><p>Nie Li smiled and transmitted his voice. &#x201C;Brother Wu Yazi, I wouldn&#x2019;t want you to die. Who knows if we might see each other again? I would rather us become friends than enemies!&#x201D;</p><p>Wu Yazi nearly tripped. Friends? What kind of person double-crosses his friends the way Nie Li does?</p><p>After Wu Yazi left, Yan Yang turned to Nie Li and asked, &#x201C;So, have you finished settling your matters?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Yeah.&#x201D; Nie Li nodded and lightly smiled. As he watched Wu Yazi&#x2019;s retreating silhouette, Nie Li had the feeling that they&#x2019;d meet again sooner or later.</p><p>Even though Yan Yang hadn&#x2019;t heard the conversation that happened between Wu Yazi and Nie Li, he had the feeling that Nie Li had somehow played Wu Yazi. Yan Yang didn&#x2019;t know what Nie Li had done to make someone from the demon clan cover for him. More and more, Yan Yang realised that he couldn&#x2019;t see through this person called Nie Li!</p><p>&#x201C;We have to leave now. If the Holy Son Li Huo catches up, things might get troublesome!&#x201D; said Nie Li.</p><p>&#x201C;Alright.&#x201D;</p><p>The two of them flew off.</p><p></p><hr><p></p><p></p><p style="text-align: center"><strong>&gt;&lt;</strong></p><p></p>
