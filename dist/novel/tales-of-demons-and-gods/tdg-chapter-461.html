<p><strong>Chapter 461 - Devour</strong></p><p>Yu Yan was well aware of how powerful the Myriad Ancestor Sword was. It was the strongest Divine Artifact in the Ancestral God Land.</p><p>However, the Myriad Ancestor Sword was being entirely suppressed by the Thunder God&#x2019;s Meteorite Sword right now.</p><p>Just how was that possible?</p><p>Where did the Thunder God&#x2019;s Meteorite Sword come from?</p><p>Nie Li was staring at the Thunder God&#x2019;s Meteorite Sword in his hands. He could vaguely sense that the sword was an astronomical black hole that was constantly devouring the power within the Myriad Ancestor Sword&#x2019;s fragments.</p><p>Frightening lightning seemed as if it wanted to break out.</p><p>The might of the Thunder God&#x2019;s Meteorite Sword grew stronger and stronger, to the point that it nearly flew out from Nie Li&#x2019;s hands.</p><p>&#x201C;What&#x2019;s going on?&#x201D; Nie Li firmly held onto the Thunder God&#x2019;s Meteorite Sword in an attempt to suppress it. All of a sudden, a fearful lightning bolt shot into Nie Li.</p><p>&#x201C;Arggggghhh!&#x201D;</p><p>Nie Li issued a painful howl as that power seemed as if it was trying to tear his body apart.</p><p>He could feel that by relying on his own strength, it was impossible to withstand the power coming from the Thunder God&#x2019;s Meteorite Sword.</p><p>&#x201C;Nie Li, what&#x2019;s wrong?&#x201D; Yu Yan anxiously asked.</p><p>Even Xiao Ning&#x2019;er and Ye Ziyun wanted to hold onto Nie Li.</p><p>&#x201C;Don&#x2019;t touch me. Otherwise, the lightning within me would circulate to you guys.&#x201D; Nie Li hastily obstructed.</p><p>&#x201C;Then, what should we do?&#x201D; Ye Ziyun was anxious to the point that tears started to fill her eyes.</p><p>&#x201C;Nie Li, how can we help you?&#x201D; Xiao Ning&#x2019;er was a little more calm compared to Ye Ziyun as she asked.</p><p>&#x201C;My strength can no longer suppress the Thunder God&#x2019;s Meteorite Sword. I have to go into the Myriad Miles Rivers and Mountains Painting, you guys come along!&#x201D; Nie Li said with a solemn voice as he quickly opened the Myriad Miles Rivers and Mountains Painting. With whooshing sound, everyone turned into streaks of light as they disappeared.</p><p>After entering into the Myriad Miles Rivers and Mountains Painting, Nie Li instantly felt his strength being enhanced several folds compared to before.</p><p>In this place, it was his domain. Everything in this world was in his control.</p><p>However, the power of the Thunder God&#x2019;s Meteorite Sword was like a wild horse that was out of control.</p><p>Nie Li could not understand why the Thunder God&#x2019;s Meteorite Sword would become so powerful after absorbing the Fragments of the Myriad Ancestor Sword. It did not seem like the usual Thunder God&#x2019;s Meteorite Sword.</p><p>&#x201C;Just what went wrong? Could this Thunder God&#x2019;s Meteorite Sword contain any secrets?&#x201D; Nie Li injected his Soul Force into the Thunder God&#x2019;s Meteorite Sword and instantly felt an endless abyss within it.</p><p>It seemed that he had underestimated the Thunder God&#x2019;s Meteorite Sword in the past!</p><p>The power from the Myriad Ancestor Sword had thoroughly awakened the Thunder God&#x2019;s Meteorite Sword, causing all of its potential to explode!</p><p>The current Thunder God&#x2019;s Meteorite Sword was simply no different to a Divine Spiritual Artifact.</p><p>Yu Yan closed her eyes as she sensed the Thunder God&#x2019;s Meteorite Sword. She abruptly opened them and spoke, &#x201C;I never expected it to be so powerful to the point that it would far surpass my imagination. This should not be something from this world!&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;If this is not from this world, where did it come from?&#x201D; Nie Li could not help pondering over that question. Although they were currently in the Myriad Miles Rivers and Mountains Painting, which lessened his pain, he still could not control the Thunder God&#x2019;s Meteorite Sword.</p><p>Nie Li&#x2019;s Soul Force kept roaming in the Thunder God&#x2019;s Meteorite Sword, trying to sense the power within.</p><p>All of a sudden, a solemn voice entered his mind. That voice was as booming as a bell.</p><p>&#x201C;Infinity has no beginning, no beginning can have no end.&#x201D; That solemn voice was extremely aged and hoarse, as if it came from the primordial times.</p><p>Hearing that voice, Nie Li&#x2019;s eyes abruptly widened. It was naturally, he knew that sentence extremely well.</p><p>They were the words that Emperor Kong Ming had left on the monument.</p><p>In an instant, countless thoughts flashed across Nie Li&#x2019;s mind and endless clues seemed to have all connected together.</p><p>Underneath the Ancient Orchid City Ruins, there was an empty coffin, along with a page of the Temporal Demon Spirit Book,</p><p>The ancient array that connected the Abyss Prison Realm with Glory City, the stone monument that was hidden in the Abyss Prison Realm, along with the Thunder God&#x2019;s Meteorite Sword that was suppressed in the Heavenly Sacred Border.</p><p>Not to mention the Desert Palace that sat in the Endless Desert.</p><p>There was a mysterious connection to everything.</p><p>The Thunder God&#x2019;s Meteorite Sword and the Temporal Demon Spirit Book both came from another world.</p><p>And all the connections seemed to have finalized on a single person, Emperor Kong Ming. Just who the heck was Emperor Kong Ming? What was he trying to do by leaving all these behind?</p><p>A wild guess flashed across Nie Li&#x2019;s mind. Perhaps, Emperor Kong Ming wasn&#x2019;t someone from this world. He came from another world and brought along the Temporal Demon Spirit Book along with the Thunder God&#x2019;s Meteorite Sword.</p><p>Naturally, it was just a guess of Nie Li&#x2019;s that could not be verified.</p><p>In the endless universe, it&apos;s hard to find any trace of Emperor Kong Ming.</p><p>If he wished to defeat the Sage Emperor, the Temporal Demon Spirit Book and the Thunder God&#x2019;s Meteorite Sword were both crucial!</p><p>The entire Draconic Ruins Realm was sealed off by the Sage Emperor. Everything in the realm seemed as if it could be sensed by the Sage Emperor. Any powerful Artifact, with the Myriad Ancestor Sword included, could not defeat the Sage Emperor. Was that the reason why the Myriad Ancestor Sword ended up in fragments?</p><p>The time and space of this realm was also being controlled by the Sage Emperor. If he wished to defeat the Sage Emperor, foreign objects from another world would be his only choice.</p><p>That would also mean that it was the Thunder God&#x2019;s Meteorite Sword and the Temporal Demon Spirit Book!</p><p>In his previous life, Nie Li possessed the Temporal Demon Spirit Book and from it, he gained the strength to fight the Sage Emperor. However, he naturally failed.</p><p>In this life, he&#x2019;ll add on the Thunder God&#x2019;s Meteorite Sword!</p><p>Resolute radiance flashed across Nie Li&#x2019;s eyes. No matter what, he had to gain control of the Thunder God&#x2019;s Meteorite Sword! He tightly held onto the Thunder God&#x2019;s Meteorite Sword as he circulated his Soul Force and injected it into the sword in an attempt to control it.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>A black lightning stormed into Nie Li&#x2019;s body, causing a painful expression to instantly surface.</p><p>That surge of power was simply too powerful!</p><p>It was like an unyielding dragon. A cold light appeared on the body of the sword as lightning exploded.</p><p>&#x201C;Let&#x2019;s help Nie Li to suppress the Thunder God&#x2019;s Meteorite Sword!&#x201D; At the sight of it, Yu Yan immediately ordered as she looked at Ye Ziyun and Xiao Ning&#x2019;er.</p><p>&#x201C;What should we do?&#x201D; Xiao Ning&#x2019;er and Ye Ziyun were already impatient. Seeing how much pain Nie Li was in, and the fact that they could not render any assistance to him, already made them extremely anxious.</p><p>&#x201C;We&#x2019;ll inject our Soul Force into Nie Li&#x2019;s body together!&#x201D; Yu Yan said and, thereafter, she immediately formed seals with her hands as boundless Soul Force surged out of her body and poured into Nie Li.</p><p>At the sight of that, Xiao Ning&#x2019;er and Ye Ziyun also did the same and started to gather the Soul Force within their bodies.</p><p>Three powerful energies were injected into Nie Li&#x2019;s body.</p><p>At this instant, in the depths of the Myriad Miles Rivers and Mountains Painting, a small creature gradually opened its eyes and wobbly stood up. It had a golden body, and a big belly that seemed like a duck. It also had a pair of small wings on the back and massive eyes that were as round as a ball.</p><p>&#x201C;Gulu gulu, gulu gulu!&#x201D; That little fellow was Jindan, who had been in a deep slumber in the Myriad Miles Rivers and Mountains Painting.</p><p>After sleeping for so long, it&apos;s fur turned even more sparkling compared to before.</p><p>&#x201C;Gulu gulu.&#x201D; Jindan blinked its eyes. It was originally enjoying it&apos;s beauty sleep, but the abnormal power fluctuation woke it up.</p><p></p><hr><p></p>
