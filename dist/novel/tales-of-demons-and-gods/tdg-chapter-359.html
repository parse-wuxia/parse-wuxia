<p><strong>Chapter 359 - Back Spikes</strong></p><p>Guo Huai rapidly retreated to create a distance between himself and Nie Li. Then, with a furious roar, his body rapidly expanded and turned into that of a gigantic Nethermoon Draconic Beast.</p><p>Although the Nethermoon Draconic Beast was shorter than the Bloodwing Saint Jiao-dragon, its aura far surpassed Nie Li&#x2019;s Bloodwing Saint Jiao-dragon&#x2019;s. A layer of bone grew around its body, forming an armour of solid bone. The bone emitted a black luster, and a surge of majestic energy rushed out like a flood.</p><p>This was a Dragon Bloodline Extraordinary demon spirit, and a 9-fate one at that!</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>The Nethermoon Draconic Beast stomped the ground. An explosion sounded as the ground caved in and formed a huge crater. Then, it charged the Bloodwing Saint Jiao-dragon with unrivaled momentum.</p><p>Nie Li noticed the powerful rushing energy from the Nethermoon Draconic Beast, so he slightly bent down into a defensive posture.</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>A heavy *boom* sounded like lightning, as majestic energy burst forth.</p><p>With a loud noise accompanied by lightning rolls, another huge crater appeared on the solid stage and sent shards of rock flying in all directions. A huge crack expanded from where the two gigantic beasts were standing, and stretched dozens of meters in length. The nearby students immediately fled from it.</p><p>The stage that was once raised, had now been thoroughly flattened.</p><p>What frightening energy!</p><p>The spectators all showed expressions of shock.</p><p>After being hit by the Nethermoon Draconic Beast&#x2019;s impact, the Bloodwing Saint Jiao-dragon was forced backwards, and almost flew out.</p><p>Nie Li&#x2019;s strength was still too inferior to the 9-fate strength of Guo Huai.</p><p>Guo Huai&#x2019;s Nethermoon Draconic Beast suppressed Nie Li&#x2019;s Bloodwing Saint Jiao-dragon. He could tell that Nie Li wasn&#x2019;t his match in terms of strength. The corner of Guo Huai&#x2019;s mouth slightly smiled. Just as he had expected, Nie Li wasn&#x2019;t his proper opponent!</p><p>Nethermoon Strike!</p><p>Guo Huai, in his Nethermoon Draconic Beast form, suddenly brandished his palm towards the Bloodwing Saint Jiao-dragon&#x2019;s neck.</p><p>When the Nethermoon Draconic Beast&#x2019;s palm was about to land onto him, Nie Li furiously roared and his body emitted a golden light. Sharp spikes grew out from his back with frightening speed and his body expanded a little.</p><p>As the Heavenly Energy around them surged, the Bloodwing Saint Jiao-dragon underwent a mutation and became substantially strengthened.</p><p>*Fwoosh!*</p><p>The Nethermoon Draconic Beast&#x2019;s palm landed on one of the Bloodwing Saint Jiao-dragon&#x2019;s neck spikes. The spike ran through his palm and fresh blood splattered.</p><p>*Awooooo!*</p><p>The Nethermoon Draconic Beast howled miserably, until his voice went hoarse.</p><p>Everyone was stunned by the sudden change. They&#x2019;d never seen a Bloodwing Saint Jiao-dragon with spikes on its back before.</p><p>Huang Yu and Nanmen Tianhai both abruptly stood up in utter astonishment.</p><p>So Nie Li&#x2019;s God Level Bloodwing Saint Jiao-dragon was actually a mutated one!</p><p>A Dragon Bloodline God Level demon spirit was already extremely rare &#x2014; one in ten million. Since the bloodlines of such demon spirits were already at such frightening heights, the probability of finding a mutated one was even lower!</p><p>The value of this demon spirit was simply unimaginable!</p><p>To think that such a valuable demon spirit had been obtained by Nie Li. Even Huang Yu and Nanmen Tianhai couldn&#x2019;t help feeling envious. There were very few who wouldn&#x2019;t be moved by such a demon spirit! With that mutated Bloodwing Saint Jiao-dragon, Nie Li was poised to become one of the most important geniuses of the Divine Feathers Sect!</p><p>Venerable Flameless was clenching his fists so hard, that a popping sound can be heard. He never imagined that Nie Li&#x2019;s God Level Bloodwing Saint Jiao-dragon would actually turn out to be a mutated one. How was Nie Li able to obtain such a precious Dragon Bloodline demon spirit? He felt heavy-hearted. It was unfortunate that integrated demon spirits couldn&apos;t be shifted to another owner; otherwise, he&apos;d definitely try to snatch Nie Li&#x2019;s.</p><p>Why was Nie Li the one who&#x2019;d integrated with that God Level Bloodwing Saint Jiao-dragon, and not him? No wonder the old man valued Nie Li so much! However, Venerable Flameless still wasn&#x2019;t resigned.</p><p>All of the students were envious and jealous when they saw Nie Li&#x2019;s Bloodwing Saint Jiao-dragon and its golden luster.</p><p>&#x201C;Oh Heavens! That Bloodwing Saint Jiao-dragon is simply priceless!&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Before that demon spirit, all ours can simply be destroyed!&#x201D;</p><p>Many people couldn&#x2019;t help sighing at the unfairness of fate. In the Divine Feathers Sect, there were extremely few people who could integrate with a Dragon Bloodline God Level. All of them were undoubtedly children blessed by the heavens, future pillars of the Divine Feathers Sect. Ordinary people, like the spectators themselves, could only look up to them for their entire life.</p><p>At that moment, even the big five, who were observing the battle, couldn&apos;t help the ripple that passed through them.</p><p>A solemn voice sounded, &#x201C;It&#x2019;s actually a mutated one. In our few hundred years, we&#x2019;ve never even seen a mutated Dragon Bloodline God Level demon spirit before. Spread the word, Nie Li will become the most important guardian of the Divine Feathers Sect. Hierarch Skycloud, I&#x2019;ll leave Nie Li&#x2019;s teaching to you!&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Yes.&#x201D; Hierarch Skycloud replied as his gaze fell on Nie Li. Nie Li had indeed given him some unexpected turns.</p><p>Lu Piao, Gu Bei, and the rest were rejoicing at Guo Huai&#x2019;s misfortune. He was in miserable pain, since he&apos;d slammed his hand onto the Bloodwing Saint Jiao-dragon&#x2019;s spikes. They felt his pain just from imagining it.</p><p>&#x201C;I was right! Nie Li would never do anything that he&#x2019;s not certain of!&#x201D; Lu Piao laughed.</p><p>The Nethermoon Draconic Beast took several steps back. Guo Huai forcefully endured the pain as his heart trembled. He never thought that Nie Li was concealing so much strength. Nie Li&#x2019;s Bloodwing Saint Jiao-dragon actually completed its first mutation. A mutated God Level Bloodwing Saint Jiao-dragon! No wonder Venerable Flameless was determined to get rid of him.</p><p>Guo Huai&#x2019;s life had once been saved by Venerable Flameless. He was aware that the consequences of killing Nie Li would definitely be heavy, but he still threw an enraged punch at the Bloodwing Saint Jiao-dragon.</p><p>The Nethermoon Draconic Beast&#x2019;s huge fist gradually got closer. When it was about to land on Nie Li, Nie Li slightly tilted his body.</p><p>*Fwoosh!*</p><p>Once again, the Nethermoon Draconic Beast&#x2019;s fist landed on a spike on the Bloodwing Saint Jiao-dragon&#x2019;s back. These spikes were so sharp that they penetrated the Nethermoon Draconic Beast&#x2019;s fist.</p><p>Guo Huai&#x2019;s face twisted from the pain. He tried to bash Nie Li&#x2019;s brain with his other palm, but Nie Li saw the move coming, and turned his head a little</p><p>*Fwoosh!*</p><p>The Nethermoon Draconic Beast&#x2019;s left palm slammed onto another back spike, this one right behind the Bloodwing Saint Jiao-dragon&#x2019;s head.</p><p>*Awooooooooooo!*</p><p>The Nethermoon Draconic Beast painfully howled. The Bloodwing Saint Jiao-dragon had too many spikes growing out of its back! It couldn&apos;t be touched!</p><p>The first time that the Nethermoon Draconic Beast&#x2019;s palm slammed onto a back spile, everyone thought that it was just a coincidence. However, after the second and third time, they understood that Nie Li was actually consciously using the back spikes to defend against the Nethermoon Draconic Beast. What shocked the spectators was how precise Nie Li was with his defense, as though he already knew where the Nethermoon Draconic Beast was going to attack!</p><p>Both of the Nethermoon Draconic Beast&#x2019;s hands had suffered heavy injuries. Fresh blood poured. At such a miserable scene, the spectators could only imagine how much pain Guo Huai was in. How pitiful!</p><p>*Roar!*</p><p>The Nethermoon Draconic Beast wrathfully snarled and took several steps back. The Bloodwing Saint Jiao-dragon&#x2019;s back spikes were so sharp that even Guo Huai had started to fear them within his heart. Heavenly Energy surged around him in a chaotic and violent storm.</p><p>Large wind blades formed around the Nethermoon Draconic Beast.</p><p>&#x201C;Die!&#x201D; Guo Huai snarled. He&#x2019;d been thoroughly enraged by Nie Li.</p><p></p><hr><p></p><p></p><p style="text-align: center"><strong>&gt;&lt;</strong></p><p></p>
