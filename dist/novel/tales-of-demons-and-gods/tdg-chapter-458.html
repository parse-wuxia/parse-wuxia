<p><strong>Chapter 458 - Purchasing Elixirs</strong></p><p>All along, Xuan Yue assumed that she was ranked third amongst the talents in the Heavenly Note Sect.</p><p>Aside from Xiao Ning&#x2019;er and Ye Ziyun, she never placed anyone else in her eyes.</p><p>However, she never expected that aside from her, there were so many other Dao of Dragon Realm geniuses in the Heavenly Note Sect.</p><p>In just that instant, her dreams on becoming the Sect Master were scattered.</p><p>&#x201C;No, that&#x2019;s impossible. Sect Master, they must have done some demonic sorcery and intend on duping you!&#x201D; Xuan Yue insanely yelled. At this very instant, the aloof bearing that she had pretended to have was all torn apart.</p><p>Her unsounded actions caused Nangong Xianyin to frown her brows.</p><p>&#x201C;Sect Master, you must not be bewitched by those nasty people!&#x201D; Xuan Yue hysterically yelled.</p><p>Nangong Xianyin could naturally tell that it was unnatural for so many geniuses to appear. However, when everything was linked together with Nie Li, it all became natural.</p><p>Based on the powerful medicinal effects of those Sacred Elixirs that were given by Nie Li itself, it wasn&#x2019;t something difficult to create several Dao of Dragon Realm geniuses.</p><p>&#x201C;Xuan Yue, don&#x2019;t make a racket in the main hall. Someone, take her away!&#x201D; Nangong Xianyin solemnly barked.</p><p>Very quickly, a few guards came and took Xuan Yue away.</p><p>Xuan Yue lowered her head as she deeply glared at Nie Li&#x2019;s trio and hung her dispiritedly head, she was unresigned. However, she knew that she no longer had any chance in changing anything.</p><p>Looking at Xuan Yue being removed, Nangong Xianyin fell into deep thoughts. She clearly never imagined that Xiao Ning&#x2019;er and Ye Ziyun actually nurtured so many geniuses. As these geniuses were all nurtured by the two of them, the two of them naturally left a deep brand on them.</p><p>Was it Nie Li&#x2019;s motive to control the Heavenly Note Sect?</p><p>If that was the case, could she still use these people? If she didn&#x2019;t, was there anyone else in the Heavenly Note Sect that she could use?</p><p>Nangong Xianyin could not help rubbing her brows.</p><p>Looking at her distressed manner, Nie Li couldn&#x2019;t help showing a smile, &#x201C;Sect Master Nangong seems to be in distress!&#x201D;</p><p>Nangong Xianyin glanced at Nie Li, depressedly sighed as she bitterly smiled, &#x201C;Sect Master Nie, you did this on purpose, right?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Your words are too serious, Sect Master Nangong.&#x201D; Nie Li faintly smiled as he continued, &#x201C;I&#x2019;ve recently received news that the Demon God&#x2019;s Sect has received the inheritance of the Ancestral Demonic Saint Land and was raising a large army without restraints. With the Pentastrike Demon Sect and the Scarlet Moon Sect blindly following the Demon God&#x2019;s Sect&#x2019;s lead, the Demon God&#x2019;s Sect might not be able to hold themselves back any longer.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;I&#x2019;m well aware of that. The motive for Sect Master Nie speaking of this issue is&#x2026;&#x201D; Nangong Xianyin frowned her brows.</p><p>Nie Li faintly smiled, &#x201C;If the Demon God&#x2019;s Sect were to take action against the Righteous Sects, who would they target first?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;That would naturally be the weakest Sect.&#x201D; Nangong Xianyin answered after falling into a brief moment of ponder.</p><p>&#x201C;Then the weakest Sect is&#x2026;&#x201D; Nie Li&#x2019;s mouth rose into a smile.</p><p>&#x201C;Divine Feathers&#x2026;&#x201D; Just when Nangong Xianyin were about to speak, she could not help feeling a little embarrassed. After all, the Sect Master of the Divine Feathers Sect was still present.</p><p>&#x201C;In the past, the Divine Feathers Sect was undoubtedly the weakest amongst them all. However, the Divine Feathers Sect right now was no long comparable to it&apos;s past. As for the reason why, I&#x2019;m sure that Sect Master Nangong is well-aware of that.&#x201D; Nie Li looked at Nangong Xianyin with a smile and at the same time, not a smile.</p><p>Nangong Xianyin fell into her thoughts for a brief moment. She naturally understood Nie Li&#x2019;s meaning behind his words. In the past, the Divine Feathers Sect was undoubtedly the weakest Sect. However, it was hard to say now. Without considering any other factors, just those Sacred Elixirs that were given by Nie Li, which possessed powerful medicinal effects that even she was well-aware. Just based on those elixirs that were gifted by Nie Li alone, it could allow the few Martial Ancestor Realm experts of the Divine Feathers Sect to increase in power by several folds. At the same time, it could also nurture many outstanding geniuses, since the Divine Feathers Sect must definitely be in possession of even more elixirs.</p><p>The current strength of the Divine Feathers Sect was deep and unmeasurable.</p><p>Amongst the six Righteous Sects, the Divine Feathers Sect was removed from the list. The Skyblaze Sect was the most powerful, while the Sky Origin and Phaseless Sects being on the same level. Thereafter, it would be the Heavenly Note Sect and the Thousand Flowers Sect. Therefore, the possibility of the Heavenly Note Sect being their first target was extremely high.</p><p>&#x201C;Let&#x2019;s not mention who will be the first to suffer their attacks. The Ancestral Demonic Saint Land still holds a huge conspiracy, which is to refine the entire Draconic Ruins Realm. If the Ancestral Demonic Saint Land succeeds in doing that, I&#x2019;m afraid that it will be difficult for the Heavenly Note Sect to be exempted from the shock wave.&#x201D; Nie Li calmly said.</p><p>Hearing Nie Li&#x2019;s words, Nangong Xianyin and Xiu Ming trembled in fear.</p><p>&#x201C;What are those words based on?&#x201D; Xiu Ming looked at Nie Li. If that was the case, then the Sky Origin Sect should also make their preparations. Although Nie Li wasn&#x2019;t quite pleasing to his eyes, it concerned the life and death of the every Righteous Sect. Thus, he had no choice but to lay down his prejudice.</p><p>&#x201C;It&#x2019;s up to you to believe my words. Anyhow, the Divine Feathers Sect has already made our preparations to battle. As for the other Righteous Sects, it&#x2019;s not our business!&#x201D; Nie Li smiled.</p><p>&#x201C;In recent times, it was indeed true that there were movements from the Demon God&#x2019;s Sect.&#x201D; Nangong Xianyin said after pondering for a brief moment. She had to admit that the words from Nie Li truly did contain a powerful impact.</p><p>Refining the entire Draconic Ruins Realm. If the Ancestral Demonic Saint Land was to succeed in it, none of the Righteous Sects would be able to escape alive.</p><p>&#x201C;Sect Master Nie Li, I disagree with you. There are eggs under the nest.&#x201D; Xiu Ming immediately continued, &#x201C;I wonder if the Sect Master Nie has any good ideas?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;We can only increase our own strength.&#x201D; Nie Li did not bother with Xiu Ming as he stared at Nangong Xianyin. &#x201C;Facing the Ancestral Demonic Saint Land, no one has any odds of success. If the Heavenly Note Sect is still having their guards against the Divine Feathers Sect, then there&#x2019;s nothing I can do to help!&#x201D;</p><p>Nangong Xianyin naturally understood Nie Li&#x2019;s meaning. The Heavenly Note Sect was currently lacking in strength. If they continued to have their guards up and obstruct them at this moment and not start using those capable young disciples, the future of the Heavenly Note Sect would be in even more danger.</p><p>&#x201C;I will definitely consider Sect Master Nie&#x2019;s words carefully.&#x201D; Nangong Xianyin nodded her head.</p><p>At this moment, Xiu Ming recalled another matter. If the Divine Feathers Sect and the Heavenly Note Sect formed an alliance, then they would be safe. But what about the Sky Origin Sect? The Heavenly Note Sect obtained Sacred Elixirs from the Divine Feathers Sect, but what were they? Why did Nangong Xianyin care about those elixirs so much to the point that she would use a Fragment of the Myriad Ancestor Sword to make the exchange?</p><p>&#x201C;Sect Master Nie, I&#x2019;m wondering, just what are those Sacred Elixirs from the Divine Feathers Sect?&#x201D; Xiu Ming tried to probe.</p><p>&#x201C;Sacred Elixirs? They are merely ordinary elixirs that could be used to increase one&#x2019;s cultivation.&#x201D; Nie Li appeared very relaxed.</p><p>If they were indeed ordinary elixirs, then Nangong Xianyin would naturally not pay so much attention to them. The more casual Nie Li was, the more Xiu Ming felt an itch in his heart. He was the Young Sect Master of the Sky Origin Sect. Although he was furious that Nie Li had stolen his sweetheart, he was even more concerned with the prosperity and decline of his Sect.</p><p>As long as he protected his position as the Young Sect Master, what kind of woman couldn&#x2019;t he have?</p><p>Xiu Ming took a glance at Xiao Ning&#x2019;er and Ye Ziyun before retracting his gaze.</p><p>From the conversation between Nangong Xianyin and Nie Li, he could judge that the times have changed for the Divine Feathers Sect due to those Sacred Elixirs. At the same time, the Heavenly Note Sect also received benefits due to those Sacred Elixirs.</p><p>If the Heavenly Note Sect and the Divine Feathers Sect were gotten stronger, then how could the Sky Origin Sect fall behind?!</p><p>&#x201C;I wonder if I can have an elixir from Sect Master Nie? I can purchase it from you!&#x201D; Xiu Ming said after brief consideration.</p><p></p><hr><p></p>
