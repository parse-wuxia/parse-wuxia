<p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>Chapter 398 - Two Holy Sons</strong></p><p>Nie Li didn&#x2019;t know whether the voice really belonged to the Void Illusionary Divine Palace; however, he was certain that it wanted to slaughter everyone by using the Ganges Crystals to turn them on each other.</p><p>As for the six people who could gather the most Ganges Crystals being able to split the treasures of the palace &#x2014; that was clearly a lie!</p><p>That voice was so stingy, it couldn&#x2019;t bear to part with even a single piece of gold spiritual stone essence. Forget about all the treasures!</p><p>Nie Li was certain that the voice had purposely distracted the experts outside in order to keep them from coming in here.</p><p>Soon, Nie Li would find the critical point of this inscription pattern array!</p><p>Suddenly, Xiao Yu and Wu Yazi flew in.</p><p>Xiao Yu saw Nie Li and said in an anxious voice, &#x201C;Nie Li, the experts outside have made their way in. What should we do?&#x201D;</p><p>Nie Li furrowed his brows for a moment. Now, it&#x2019;d be harder for him to solve the inscription pattern array.</p><p>&#x201C;Follow me!&#x201D; Nie Li barked as he flew into a corner with Xiao Yu and Wu Yazi.</p><p>Hundreds of experts charged into the main hall and began searching for treasures. They scuttled back and forth over the inscription pattern array without realising what it really was.</p><p>Nie Li&#x2019;s group of three huddled in the corner and watched them.</p><p>Wu Yazi was on full guard.</p><p>It should&#x2019;ve been extremely difficult for someone to break the crystal jade wall and enter this chamber. However, the reality was that large numbers of experts had made their way here. Nie Li was sure that the Void Illusionary Divine Palace had done it on purpose, to keep him away from the inscription pattern array!</p><p>&#x201C;There are Ganges Crystals!&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;So many of them!&#x201D;</p><p>Hundreds of thousands of Ganges Crystals suddenly rained down in the center of the inscription pattern array. Everyone&#x2019;s eyes turned red with greed as the slaughter resumed.</p><p>A chaotic battle broke out.</p><p>*Boom!* *Boom!* *Boom!*</p><p>Energy swept through the room as the fresh blood splattered.</p><p>All of them seemed as though they&#x2019;d gone insane as they fought over the Ganges Crystals.</p><p>After all, there were several hundreds of thousands of Ganges Crystals gathered here. If one of them managed to kill the others and collect all the crystals, they&#x2019;d instantly jump into the top six.</p><p>Even Wu Yazi was affected by the eager frenzy. After all, there were so many Ganges Crystals here and he didn&#x2019;t want to miss out on the opportunity.</p><p>Nie Li pulled him back. &#x201C;Don&#x2019;t do it. Let them fight!&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Why?&#x201D; Wu Yazi looked at Nie Li, puzzled.</p><p>Nie Li transmitted his voice back to Wu Yazi. &#x201C;Don&#x2019;t you think it&#x2019;s strange? Those experts are all slaughtering each other over these Ganges Crystals!&#x201D;</p><p>Realisation dawned on Wu Yazi and he shivered. He remained next to Nie Li and Xiao Yu, guarding them.</p><p>Nie Li had entered the room before them; it&#x2019;s very likely he&#x2019;d noticed something! As long as Wu Yazi protected Nie Li, there was a high chance that they&#x2019;d be able to obtain the Void Illusionary Divine Palace&#x2019;s treasures!</p><p>Another five or six hundred experts flooded into the chamber and fueled the battle.</p><p>A brief moment later, another group flew in, bringing two or three hundred people. It was the Holy Son Li Huo and his men. The Holy Son swept an eye over the fighting experts and the Ganges Crystals littered on the ground and said, &#x201C;Kill everyone. Don&#x2019;t let a single one go!&#x201D;</p><p>The experts standing behind Li Huo leapt forward and began killing.</p><p>*Boom!* *Boom!* *Boom!*</p><p>The Demon God&#x2019;s Sect members slaughtered hundreds at a time. It was a one-sided massacre.</p><p>Five of them pounced towards Wu Yazi.</p><p>Wu Yazi brought out a medal and barked, &#x201C;I&#x2019;m from the Demon God&#x2019;s Sect!&#x201D;</p><p>The five experts saw the medal and hesitated. Then they turned and charged in the other direction.</p><p>The Holy Son Li Huo had provoked the other experts. They realised that if they continued fighting each other, then they&#x2019;d all be killed by the Holy Son; therefore, they quickly joined forces to confront the Demon God&#x2019;s Sect.</p><p>The Holy Son Li Huo eyed the experts and coldly snorted, &#x201C;You&#x2019;re overestimating yourselves!&#x201D;</p><p>Nie Li transmitted his voice to Wu Yazi and asked, &#x201C;Who&#x2019;s that guy?&#x201D;</p><p>Wu Yazi appeared to be in a little lack of confidence and said, &#x201C;He&#x2019;s the Holy Son Li Huo of the Demon God&#x2019;s Sect, and the one most likely to become the next Sect Master. You and Xiao Yu need to restrain your auras. You definitely can&#x2019;t let yourselves be discovered. If he finds out that I used the Demon Blood Sacrifice on you, then I&#x2019;m doomed!&#x201D;</p><p>The Holy Son Li Huo?</p><p>Nie Li had heard of him in his previous life. The Holy Son Li Huo had indeed become the Sect Master of the Demon God&#x2019;s Sect, and a domineering figure of the future. He was the one who led the Demon God Sect to destroy the Divine Feathers Sect&#x2019;s Soul Hall. That was the beginning of the fall of the Divine Feathers Sect.</p><p>Nie Li never expected to encounter him here!</p><p>Nie Li restrained his aura. If the Holy Son Li Huo found out that they&#x2019;d used the Demon Blood Sacrifice, then the three of them would all be killed!</p><p>The Holy Son Li Huo coldly swept his eyes over Wu Yazi&#x2019;s group of three, then looked away. Wu Yazi had a decent standing within the Demon God&#x2019;s Sect and even so, it was below Li Huo&#x2019;s. However, since he&#x2019;s also from the Demon God&#x2019;s Sect, the Holy Son Li Huo wasn&#x2019;t going to do anything to him.</p><p>The Holy Son Li Huo&#x2019;s subordinates were simply too powerful; on top of that, they possessed high-graded artifacts. The other experts were slaughtered so thoroughly that not even a fifth of them were left standing. The majority of the Ganges Crystals had fallen into Li Huo&#x2019;s hands.</p><p>Li Huo fixed his eyes on the ten statues and furrowed his brows. Corpses littered the ground and fresh blood flowed in rivers; however, the inscription patterns glowed even more brightly through the red.</p><p>Nie Li&#x2019;s heart shivered when he saw the Holy Son focusing on the inscription patterns. Could he be calculating the inscription pattern array?</p><p>As the Holy Son Li Huo pondered, another two or three hundred people entered the chamber, led by Yan Yang of the Skyblaze Sect!</p><p>Yan Yang observed his surroundings, and a chilly light flashed through his eyes when he saw the Holy Son Li Huo. Li Huo would definitely make a difficult opponent. However, there was no fear in Yan Yang&#x2019;s eyes, only blazing with fighting spirit.</p><p>One dark and one light. The Holy Son of the Demon God&#x2019;s Sect and the Holy Son of the Skyblaze Sect were gathered in this small back chamber!</p><p>Nie Li&#x2019;s heart shivered again at Yan Yang&#x2019;s entrance. He never thought that he&#x2019;d be here too. It looked like things were about to get lively. The Holy Sons of two major sects. Neither would give way to the other. Nie Li wondered whether they&#x2019;d have the opportunity to open the inscription pattern array?</p><p></p><hr><p></p><p></p><p style="text-align: center"><strong>&gt;&lt;</strong></p><p></p>
