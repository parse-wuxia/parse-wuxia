<p><strong>Chapter 322 - Myriad Miles Rivers and Mountains</strong></p><p>Nie Li laid inscription patterns arrays down on the fake Myriad Miles Rivers and Mountains Painting. Forming layers upon layers of inscription pattern locks. The outer layer was a Myriad Spiritual Lock. This lock alone could even keep out a Martial Ancestor Realm expert, given they weren&#x2019;t proficient with inscription patterns. There were also many other inscription patterns concealed inside it.</p><p>A little over two hours later, an identical Myriad Miles Rivers and Mountains Painting appeared on the table. Nie Li then slowly shifted that expert&#x2019;s intent from the genuine Myriad Miles Rivers and Mountains Painting to the fake one.</p><p>&#x201C;Not a bad counterfeit!&#x201D; Nie Li lightly smiled as he looked at his replica. Secretly, he thought that he have to find an opportunity to get Gu Bei&#x2019;s men to bring this fake Myriad Miles Rivers and Mountains Painting to the outside world, feigning injury and drop this Myriad Miles Rivers and Mountains Painting in the middle of escape. Then, this fake will make its way into the hands of experts from the other sects. That way, it&#x2019;ll be hard for that Martial Ancestor Realm expert to guess the location of the genuine article.</p><p>&#x2018;But, it&#x2019;ll be a problem if that Martial Ancestor Realm expert can see through the counterfeit!&#x2019;</p><p>Nie Li didn&#x2019;t dare underestimate a Martial Ancestor Realm expert. After all, a Martial Ancestor Realm expert still had rather brilliant methods up their sleeve. Who knows? He might even be able to track the fake back to the original.</p><p>&#x2018;At least this counterfeit can buy me some time. Since that Martial Ancestor Realm expert has sold the Myriad Miles Rivers and Mountains Painting, as long as he can sense the existence of his intent, he&#x2019;ll most likely wait for a certain period of time. He&#x2019;ll wait a bit for someone to decipher the painting after breaking it open and adding on to the time that it would take for him to track back here. It would take quite a bit of time by the time he tracked me. It&#x2019;s best to let this Myriad Miles Rivers and Mountains Painting transfer hands several times. This way, it&#x2019;ll be a lot safer,&#x2019; Nie Li inwardly thought.</p><p>Nie Li placed the counterfeit Myriad Miles Rivers and Mountains Painting into his interspatial ring. He lightly smiled and began using his intent to fumble the various sealing inscription patterns on the original Myriad Miles Rivers and Mountains Painting.</p><p>This Myriad Spiritual Lock was only a small portion of it that a Martial Ancestor Realm expert could sense it. However, there were still many layers of sealing inscription patterns concealed within the Myriad Miles Rivers and Mountains Painting, aside from that Myriad Spiritual Lock. Rashly breaking the Myriad Spiritual Lock could lead to a rebound.</p><p>The Myriad Spiritual Lock on the outside had traces of being touched. This proved that someone had tried to break open the Myriad Spiritual Lock sealing inscription patterns. However, that person probably suffered quite a big backlash, because inside the Myriad Spiritual Lock were even more profound sealing inscription pattern arrays! Once anyone tried to open the Myriad Spiritual Lock, it will stir up the rebound energy from those sealing inscription patterns behind.</p><p>&#x201C;Even if it&#x2019;s a Martial Ancestor Realm expert, without fifty to sixty years of studying, trying to break these sealing inscription patterns is simply finding a way to suffer!&#x201D; Nie Li lightly smiled. This was also why that Martial Ancestor Realm expert ended up selling it. There was really nothing else he could do.</p><p>A supreme expert once said, &#x201C;Only those who are virtuous are deserving of treasures&#x201D;. However, he was wrong. Instead, it should be &#x201C;Those who are capable should deserve them&#x201D;.</p><p>Only with sufficient capability could one have the qualifications to use such a treasure. That Marital Ancestor Realm expert couldn&#x2019;t break the sealing inscription patterns on the Myriad Miles Rivers and Mountains painting; he must not be destined with this treasure.</p><p>Nie Li had spent hundreds of years in solitude within the Temporal Demon Spirit Book, constantly studying inscription patterns. If it wasn&#x2019;t for that, it&#x2019;d be hard for him to unlock the inscription patterns on the Myriad Miles Rivers and Mountains Painting.</p><p>Nie Li took up his brush, dipped it in demonic blood, and started to write down inscription patterns. The lines emitted a lustrous light before they were injected into the Myriad Miles Rivers and Mountains Painting.</p><p>*Boom!* *Boom!* *Boom!*</p><p>Nie Li&#x2019;s inscription patterns entered the Myrian Miles Rivers and Mountains Painting and collided with the inscription patterns already inside. They constantly exploded and disappeared.</p><p>Nie Li wrote faster and faster as the inscription patterns became a river, flowing nonstop into the Myriad Miles Rivers and Mountains Painting.</p><p>*Boom!* *Boom!* *Boom!* *Boom!* *Boom!* *Boom!*</p><p>Deep and low sounds emitted from the Myriad Miles Rivers and Mountains Painting, along with a dazzling luster and majestic energy that spread throughout the surrounding area.</p><p>Nie Li sensed the powerful impact of energy and couldn&#x2019;t help taking a step back and shielding his eyes from the dazzling light with his hands. This was only the energy dispelled from the Myriad Miles Rivers and Mountains Painting, yet it was already so frightening. Luckily he&#x2019;d already laid down an isolation barrier; otherwise, people in the Divine Feathers Sect would&#x2019;ve easily detected it.</p><p>Although Nie Li had taken a step back, he continued to write down inscription patterns.</p><p>&#x201C;It&#x2019;ll soon be complete!&#x201D; Nie Li&#x2019;s heart pounded wildly. He didn&#x2019;t dare to stop, even for a brief moment. If there was even the slightest pause, the sealing inscription patterns on the Myriad Miles Rivers and Mountains Paint would immediately reseal! This was an extremely complicated process and Nie Li&#x2019;s brain was operating at a high speed.</p><p>*Ohmm!*</p><p>A surge of boundless energy spread out like raging waves, blowing towards Nie Li.</p><p>Nie Li felt as though he was about to be devoured by this boundless energy. A surge of intense pain coursed through his body and his soul realm quaked madly. This was just a trace of the ancient divine artifact&#x2019;s might and it was already hard for Nie Li to bear.</p><p>All the bones in his body felt as though they were about to break apart.</p><p>But the moment Nie Li cowered away, all of his efforts would be wasted.</p><p>He&#x2019;d come this far, so how could he possibly allow all his work to go to waste?</p><p>Nie Li forcefully endured the pain as his right hand continued to write. Then, he bit his left thumb until fresh blood welled out, quickly pressed it onto the Myriad Miles Rivers and Mountains Painting.</p><p>As soon as Nie Li finished all the inscription patterns and pressed his left hand into the painting, an energy rushed towards the Myriad Miles Rivers and Mountains Painting. It was an energy that integrated bloodlines. Nie Li felt all of his strength being sucked dry, leaving him weak all over.</p><p>&#x201C;Gasp, gasp!&#x201D;</p><p>Nie Li wheezed for air in great lungfuls. He could sense that he&#x2019;d successfully established a faint connection with the Myriad Miles Rivers and Mountains Painting. Gradually, the energy returned to his body and he felt a little more at ease.</p><p>He bitterly smiled. Finally, he&#x2019;d subdued this fellow.</p><p>The Myriad Miles Rivers and Mountains Painting was finally connected to him through his bloodline.</p><p>Nie Li had established a small connection with the Myriad Miles Rivers and Mountains Painting. With a flick of his right hand, the Myriad Miles Rivers and Mountains Painting disappeared into his body and floated within his soul realm.</p><p>Truly, this Myriad Miles Rivers and Mountains Painting was worthy of being hailed as an ancient treasure!</p><p>Now that Nie Li had established a soul connection with it, the treasure turned into its soul form and merged with Nie Li&#x2019;s soul realm. As long as Nie Li&#x2019;s soul realm existed, the Myriad Miles Rivers and Mountains Painting would follow to wherever Nie Li&#x2019;s soul went. If Nie Li&#x2019;s soul disappeared, only then would the Myriad Miles Rivers and Mountains Painting seek a new owner.</p><p>Nie Li&#x2019;s right hand moved as he summoned it out.The Myriad Miles Rivers and Mountains Painting suspended itself before him. With a thought, Nie Li himself turned into a streak of light and entered the Myriad Miles Rivers and Mountains Painting.</p><p>Inside the Myriad Miles Rivers and Mountains Painting</p><p>Nie Li hovered in air as an endless mountain range stretched beneath him with slow-flowing rivers.</p><p>This vast space that extended for tens of thousands of miles. Mountains of different sizes shaped the range and plants growing, along with zigzagging rivers that ran through them. It looked like a small, independent realm that was filled with a rich amount of Heavenly Energy, roughly the same amount as a spiritual well. Large quantities of spiritual herbs also flourished on the mountain slopes.</p><p>This wasn&#x2019;t just an independent space; it was an independent realm!</p><p>Currently, Nie Li could only enter and exit the Myriad Miles Rivers and Mountains Painting; most of the painting&#x2019;s other functions were still unable to be unleashed. According to the legends, the Myriad Miles Rivers and Mountains Painting was a formidable divine object that had been the cause of endless battles. It exchanged hands, all its previous owners had had their spirits and souls extinguished. Therefore, this painting could be considered an ominous item.</p><p>However, Nie Li didn&#x2019;t avoid it because of its status as a taboo. He could take his time to slowly decipher its uses.</p><p>Nie Li couldn&#x2019;t help thinking inwardly. &#x2018;Actually, Jindan and Yu Yan can be concealed in this space to cultivate!&#x2019; He suddenly recalled something and took the Nightmare Demon Pot out from his interspatial ring.</p><p>The Nightmare Demon Pot was revolved as it flew into the sky, as though some sort of energy was being activated. The pot suddenly unleashed a strong, lustrous light. The image on pot became even more dazzling to the eyes. A trace of smoke released from the mouth of the pot and dispersed into the Myriad Miles Rivers and Mountains Painting.</p><p>After that, a surge of mysterious energy entered the Nightmare Demon Pot and nourished it.</p><p>So it was indeed true! The Myriad Miles Rivers and Mountains Painting really could nourish other ancient divine artifacts!</p><p>Nie Li sensed that although the Nightmare Demon Pot was constantly releasing energy, its energy was also constantly growing stronger.</p><p>Next time he refined demon spirits, he could come here to do it!</p><p>Nie Li pondered for a brief moment, then retrieved the Thunder God&#x2019;s Meteorite Sword from his interspatial ring. The moment he brought it out, bolts of lightning gathered from the surrounding and landed on the sword. The Thunder God&#x2019;s Meteorite Sword issued a dazzling light as it turned into a huge thunder sword and floated in the air, just like the Nightmare Demon Pot.</p><p>Now that Nie Li had reached the Heavenly Fate Realm, his might would be shocking when he used the Thunder God&#x2019;s Meteorite Sword. However, he decided to keep the sword here for now, so that it could be nourished.</p><p>As for the other miraculous uses of the Myriad Miles Rivers and Mountains Painting, Nie Li was looking forward to discovering them.</p><p>Both the the Thunder God&#x2019;s Meteorite Sword and the Nightmare Demon Pot were ancient divine artifacts, far more superior to any other item in Nie Li&#x2019;s interspatial ring.</p><p>These three items would form the foundation of Nie Li&#x2019;s strength! However, right now, Nie Li couldn&#x2019;t even unleash even one ten thousandth of their power.</p><p>With a move of his thought, Nie Li exited the Myriad Miles Rivers and Mountains Painting.</p><p>Yu Yan, who was guarding Nie Li, was dumbfounded. Just what kind of treasure was that painting that Nie Li brought back? You could enter it according to your wishes?</p><p>Nie Li removed the barrier in his room and looked at Yu Yan&#x2019;s shocked expression. He lightly smiled, &#x201C;Big Sister Yu Yan, this treasure is called the Myriad Miles Rivers and Mountains Painting. Inside is a vast space. From now on, you can cultivate inside the Myriad Miles Rivers and Mountains Painting.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;There&#x2019;s a separate dimension inside the painting? You can go in to cultivate?&#x201D; Yu Yan was dumbfounded. It wasn&#x2019;t possible for a living creature to enter a space within an interspatial ring. This painting of Nie Li&#x2019;s could actually be entered and used to cultivate?</p><p>No wonder Nie Li had been acting so serious and had even laid down a barrier. This painting was indeed extraordinary.</p><p>&#x201C;In that case, I&#x2019;ll take a look inside.&#x201D; Yu Yan smiled as a strong curiosity towards the space within the Myriad Miles Rivers and Mountains Painting aroused.</p><p>Nie Li opened his right hand so that Yu Yan could stand on his palm, then picked up Jindan who&#x2019;d been sleeping in a corner of his room. With a flash of his image, he turned into a streak of light and entered the Myriad Miles Rivers and Mountains Painting.</p><p></p><hr><p></p><p></p><p style="text-align: center"><strong>&gt;&lt;</strong></p><p></p>
