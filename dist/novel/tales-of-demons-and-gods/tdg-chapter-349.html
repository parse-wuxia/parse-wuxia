<p><strong>Chapter 349 - Saint Blood Draconic Falcon</strong></p><p>Nie Li leapt onto a fighting stage. Murong Yu also flew up.</p><p>Everyone&#x2019;s attention was now focused on that battle stage.</p><p>Without a doubt, Nie Li and Murong Yu&#x2019;s battle was attracting the most attention.</p><p>One was a genius from the previous year; one was from the current. Furthermore, there seemed to be an old score to settle between them.</p><p>However, from the perspective of the crowd, this challenge was simply Nie Li overestimating his own abilities. After all, their cultivations weren&#x2019;t separated by just a little; Murong Yu was years ahead of Nie Li.</p><p>Huang Yu and Nanmen Tianhai exchanged glances.</p><p>&#x201C;Nie Li actually took the initiative to challenge Murong Yu. He&#x2019;s simply too daring,&#x201D; said Huang Yu.</p><p>&#x201C;It&#x2019;s unavoidable for youngsters to be proud and arrogant,&#x201D; Nanmen Tianhai sighed as he shook his head.</p><p>They weren&#x2019;t optimistic about Nie Li&#x2019;s chances. After all, the difference between those two was the same as how Murong Yu was unable to defeat Li Xingyun.</p><p>Murong Yu looked at Nie Li and said in a sinister tone, &#x201C;Now you&#x2019;ve actually gone and challenged me. In others&#x2019; eyes, you&#x2019;re a genius. But in my eyes, you&#x2019;re nothing. Last time, I was too careless and let you escape. But this time, I&#x2019;ll crush your head into the ground and mercilessly trample you. I&#x2019;ll teach you how to respect your Senior Brother!&#x201D;</p><p>A powerful aura burst from Murong Yu&#x2019;s body in an explosion of air.</p><p>Murong Yu was already 6-fate, whereas Nie Li is only 4-fate. However, it was still impossible for Murong Yu to suppress Nie Li in terms of aura alone.</p><p>Even though Nie Li was only a 4-fate, his strength had far surpassed that level.</p><p>Nie Li didn&#x2019;t explode his aura like Murong Yu had. Instead, he calmly looked at his opponent. No matter how Murong Yu tried to enrage him, or attack his confidence, Nie Li didn&#x2019;t see Murong Yu with very much regard.</p><p>That was because he and Murong Yu weren&#x2019;t on the same level!</p><p>Nie Li looked at Murong Yu as he calmly said, &#x201C;Cut the crap. Can we start?&#x201D;</p><p>Murong Yu tried to anger Nie Li, but he never expected Nie Li to ignore his words. His jab had landed on empty air.</p><p>&#x201C;Hmph, egotistic!&#x201D; With a twitch of his right hand, Murong Yu shot an energy towards Nie Li.</p><p>*Woosh!*</p><p>The energy turned into a streak of light.</p><p>The moment it was about to hit Nie Li, his body faded away.</p><p>A miss!</p><p>Murong Yu&#x2019;s pupils narrowed as he coldly snorted, &#x201C;That move again!?&#x201D; He looked around, searching for traces of Nie Li.</p><p>Nie Li abruptly appeared as a chilling ray of light and slashed at Murong Yu&#x2019;s neck.</p><p>&#x201C;Hmph, too slow!&#x201D; Murong Yu concentrated on his fists and sent a surge of unparalleled energy towards Nie Li&#x2019;s chest.</p><p>That fist was filled with explosive energy and caused friction sparks with the air.</p><p>*Woosh!*</p><p>Nie Li saw Murong Yu&#x2019;s attack, but didn&#x2019;t pause in the slightest. Instead, he continued his slash towards Murong Yu&#x2019;s neck.</p><p>Nie Li was trying to use himself as a sacrifice and take Murong Yu down with him? How could Murong Yu possibly let things go as Nie Li wished? He dodged sideways and smashed his fist towards Nie Li&#x2019;s chest with that unparalleled energy.</p><p>If Nie Li were to suffer this blow, he&#x2019;d definitely die!</p><p>The spectators held their breaths. There was no way Nie Li could dodge that attack. Indeed, Nie Li&#x2019;s strength was still far below Murong Yu&#x2019;s.</p><p>A boom sounded as Murong Yu&#x2019;s fist landed on Nie Li&#x2019;s chest. However, Murong Yu felt a rebound of energy and instantly sensed that something was off.</p><p>Something&#x2019;s not right!</p><p>The frightening rebound almost broke Murong Yu&#x2019;s hand.</p><p>But before Murong Yu could react, Nie Li returned to his human form, grabbed Murong Yu&#x2019;s arm, and with the help of that rebound, tossed Murong Yu upwards. Murong Yu smashed onto the ground like a sandbag.</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>Before the pain in Murong Yu&#x2019;s arm had dulled, he was smashed into the ground, leaving him dizzy.</p><p>Just what was going on?</p><p>Nie Li had only used 3-fate strength, but he still mobilised such power? Furthermore, Murong Yu&#x2019;s fist hadn&#x2019;t hurt Nie Li; instead it actually made Murong Yu suffer such a powerful rebound!</p><p>Murong Yu still couldn&#x2019;t figure out what was going. Again, Nie Li flung him up into the sky and smashed him ruthlessly onto the ground like a sandbag.</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>Murong Yu felt likes his internal organs were about to explode.</p><p>Murong Yu still couldn&#x2019;t react before Nie Li flung him into the sky and unleashed a series of dazzling moves. Murong Yu was sent smashing onto the ground, yet again.</p><p>*Boom!* *Boom!* *Boom!*</p><p>Attacks continuously landed on Murong Yu.</p><p>Nie Li didn&#x2019;t use all his strength as he dealt with Murong Yu. From his opinion, there was no need to!</p><p>The spectators felt that the sight was unreal. What was going on? Why was Murong Yu the one getting beaten up?</p><p>By right, Murong Yu&#x2019;s strength should be far above Nie Li&#x2019;s! But why didn&#x2019;t Murong Yu have the slightest chance to counterattack under Nie Li&#x2019;s barrage? Why didn&#x2019;t Murong Yu&#x2019;s attacks do anything to Nie Li?</p><p>Huang Yu looked at Nanmen Tianhai as he asked, &#x201C;Is that Nie Li considered to be cheating?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;I don&#x2019;t think so. After all, we didn&#x2019;t put any restrictions on what methods they&#x2019;re allowed use!&#x201D; Nanmen Tianhai bitterly smiled.</p><p>&#x201C;That&#x2019;s merciless bullying!&#x201D;</p><p>Murong Yu suffered another series of bashes. When he tried to counterattack, he suffered even greater rebounds. He couldn&#x2019;t hurt Nie Li in the slightest! He let out a low, angry roar as his skin turned a peculiar scarlet colour.</p><p>*Boom!* *Boom!* *Boom!*</p><p>Surges of majestic energy burst forth from Murong Yu.</p><p>A huge scarlet red wing appeared from his back as he turned into a huge, formidable-looking falcon.</p><p>&#x201C;Good Heavens! It&#x2019;s actually a Saint Blood Draconic Falcon!&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Indeed, it&#x2019;s the Saint Blood Draconic Falcon! A Dragon Bloodline Extraordinary Level growth rate demon spirit!&#x201D;</p><p>The Saint Blood Draconic Falcon is one of the pinnacle varieties of the Draconic Falcon species. It&#x2019;s said to be the royalty among the Draconic Falcons. Furthermore, a Saint Blood Draconic Falcon with an Extraordinary Level growth rate is an absolute rarity. No one knew where Murong Yu got it from.</p><p>&#x201C;Earlier on, Murong Yu wasn&#x2019;t willing to merge with his demon spirit. So he was concealing his strength!&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;That Saint Blood Draconic Falcon doesn&#x2019;t have a God Level growth rate, but it&#x2019;s still enough to dominate an entire region! It&#x2019;s the most powerful existence beneath a Dragon Bloodline God Level demon spirit!&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Nie Li actually forced Murong Yu to the point that he had to merge with his demon spirit!&#x201D;</p><p>Murong Yu&#x2019;s eyes were scarlet red as he floated high up into the sky. His massive scarlet wings flapped slowly. With each flap a burst of frightening energy was unleashed.</p><p>&#x201C;I didn&#x2019;t want to merge with my demon spirit, but you&#x2019;ve forced me to! Now, I&#x2019;ll give you a thorough death!&#x201D; Surges of powerful aura burst from Murong Yu. Fiery clouds formed around him, burning as though they were trying to destroy everything.</p><p>The blazing energy surged like a tidal wave towards Nie Li.</p><p>The spectators sensed the flow of energy rolling off of the martial stage. Their faces changed. They never thought that Murong Yu had reached such a level. It looked like his ranking was definitely going to shift ahead even more.</p><p>Pressured by that powerful energy, Nie Li took several steps back and raised his head towards Murong Yu. This guy finally couldn&#x2019;t hold back anymore and had exerted all his strength!</p><p></p><hr><p></p><p></p><p style="text-align: center"><strong>&gt;&lt;</strong></p><p></p>
