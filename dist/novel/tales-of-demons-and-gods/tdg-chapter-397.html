<p><strong>Chapter 397 - You Cannot Take It With You</strong></p><p>The massacre intensified as everyone scrambled for the Ganges Crystals.</p><p>Yan Yang looked down at the corpses that carpeted the ground. Strands of energy flowed off the bodies and into the earth.</p><p>He then looked to the frenzy, where people were slaughtering each other and snatching after the Ganges Crystals. Something wasn&#x2019;t right.</p><p>&#x201C;Everyone, return! Leave the Ganges Crystals. Follow me!&#x201D; Yan Yang commanded as he flew in a separate direction.</p><p>The members of the Skyblaze Sect were confused, as they didn&#x2019;t know why Yan Yang would make such an order. However, they still followed him.</p><p>Heart of the Main Hall</p><p>Nie Li looked around him, but didn&#x2019;t find any Ganges Crystals in the main hall. He moved through a small door as he headed for the depths of the hall.</p><p>At the far end of the hall stood dozens of statues, all covered in inscription patterns.</p><p>The corner of Nie Li&#x2019;s mouth twitched into a smile. According to his calculations, one statue among these dozens should be the right one.</p><p>These statues could&#x2019;ve easily fool anyone but Nie Li. He stood still as he thought things through.</p><p>As Nie Li pondered, the towering crystal jade wall suddenly crumbled and a long passage opened before the eyes of everyone who was cultivating.</p><p>The crowd was stunned.</p><p>No matter how they&#x2019;d tried, they could never enter the crystal jade wall. So why did it suddenly open all on its own?</p><p>&#x201C;Let&#x2019;s go!&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Go in and take a look!&#x201D;</p><p>*Woosh!* *Woosh!* *Woosh!*</p><p>One expert after another rushed through the entrance. In their minds, the Void Illusionary Divine Palace must conceal endless treasures.</p><p>The life gate also opened and torrents of experts rushed through.</p><p>Nie Li walked past one statue after another. He&#x2019;d already determined that those seven weren&#x2019;t the right ones.</p><p>A deep and enraged snort sounded from the depths of the Void Illusionary Divine Palace. &#x201C;Who dares to disturb me? Leave this instant! Otherwise, don&#x2019;t blame me for getting impolite!&#x201D;</p><p>The voice boomed like a thunderclap.</p><p>Nie Li looked up into the depths of the Void Illusionary Divine Palace. &#x201C;Who are you?&#x201D;</p><p>The voice responded with a chilling murderous intent. &#x201C;I am the Void Illusionary Divine Palace! Everything inside is controlled by me. If I wanted to, I could turn every living creature inside here into ashes. You should not be here. Leave now!&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Oh!&#x201D; Nie Li nodded. He kept examining these statues.</p><p>The voice grew more enraged. &#x201C;Do you understand words? Get lost! Or else, don&#x2019;t blame me for getting impolite!&#x201D;</p><p>Nie Li calmly replied, &#x201C;Well in that case, you don&#x2019;t have to bother about being impolite. I&#x2019;m just a Heavenly Fate Realm, after all. It&#x2019;s not a big deal even if I die.&#x201D;</p><p>Nie Li had totally discarded his cares for life and death!</p><p>The voice went silent for a brief moment before it said, &#x201C;If you&#x2019;re not afraid of death, why not fight for the Ganges Crystals in the outer hall? That way, you&#x2019;d get a chance to obtain the treasures concealed within the Void Illusionary Divine Palace!&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;I&#x2019;m just a lowly Heavenly Fate Realm, while the people outside are at least of the Heavenly Star or Axis Realms. How could I possibly compete with them?&#x201D; Nie Li took a few steps forward. The eighth statue didn&#x2019;t look right either.</p><p>The voice continued to reason. &#x201C;Just because you&#x2019;re a Heavenly Fate Realm doesn&#x2019;t mean you don&#x2019;t have a chance. I&#x2019;ve hidden hundreds of thousands of Ganges Crystals in one of the secret chambers out in the main hall. If you listen to my instructions, I&#x2019;ll lead you to them. That way, you can easily obtain the Void Illusionary Divine Palace&#x2019;s treasures!&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Really?&#x201D; Nie Li said in astonishment.</p><p>&#x201C;Of course!&#x201D; the voice responded. &#x201C;I am only a strand of the Void Illusionary Divine Palace&#x2019;s intent. I have no use for such treasures. Why would I lie?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;What kinds of treasures are hidden inside the Void Illusionary Divine Palace?&#x201D; Nie Li approached the ninth statue. It didn&#x2019;t look to be the array&#x2019;s crucial point either.</p><p>The voice responded with temptation. &#x201C;There are tons of treasures in the Void Illusionary Divine Palace. There are tens of millions of gold spiritual stone essences alone. On top of that, there&#x2019;re countless artifacts. Just a small portion of them would rival the great wealth of a single divine sect!&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;But I&#x2019;m not interested in those!&#x201D; Nie Li responded, as he continued to study the statues.</p><p>&#x201C;Aside from treasures, there are also many ancient divine artifacts inside the Void Illusionary Divine Palace. Powerful, ancient divine artifacts. All it takes is a drop of blood and a claim of ownership. Then, you could wield them and possess great strength!&#x201D; the voice continued.</p><p>Nie Li shook his head. &#x201C;Not interested!&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Then, what are you interested in?!&#x201D; the voice&#x2019;s tone was solemn and coldly angered.</p><p>&#x201C;I think these statues are rather interesting. You see, I&#x2019;m actually a travelling minstrel!&#x201D; Nie Li replied as he studied the inscription patterns on the statue before him with great interest.</p><p>Suddenly, Nie Li&#x2019;s eyes were attracted to one of the statues&#x2019; legs. It was a stray piece of gold spiritual stone essence.</p><p>It was only a single piece, not some shocking wealth. However, it was still better than nothing. Nie Li bent down and picked it up.</p><p>The moment he did so, the voice changed to an ear-shattering hysteria.</p><p>&#x201C;Put down that gold spiritual stone essence! It&#x2019;s mine!&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;If you dare to take it away, I&#x2019;ll kill you!&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Everything in this Void Illusionary Divine Palace belongs to me! It&#x2019;s mine! All mine! No one is allowed to touch them! Whoever touches it will be killed! Kill, kill, kill, kill, kill! I&#x2019;ll kill all of you! No one is allowed to take my treasures away&#x2026;&#x201D; The voice wailed, like a demonic note entering Nie Li&#x2019;s ears.</p><p>Nie Li was still holding the gold spiritual stone essence in his right hand as he furrowed his brows at the ear-piercing voice. It almost destroyed his eardrums.</p><p>It was only a single piece of gold spiritual stone essence. Was there really a need to get so emotional?</p><p>Suddenly, an idea came to Nie Li and the corner of his mouth twitched. He went back to studying the statues.</p><p>&#x201C;Did you not hear me? Put it down and beat it! Otherwise, I&#x2019;ll give you a tragic end!&#x201D; The voice snarled, like a shrew shouting curses on the street.</p><p>Nie Li wasn&#x2019;t bothered in the least; he was focusing on the statues&#x2019; inscription patterns.</p><p>One figure after another smoothly flew into the main hall and charged forward without the least sign of hinderance.</p><p>&#x201C;This is already the main hall!&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Where are the palace&#x2019;s treasures?&#x201D;</p><p>They searched around hurriedly before they discovered a small door, tightly shut.</p><p>&#x201C;Could it be here?&#x201D;</p><p></p><hr><p></p><p></p><p style="text-align: center"><strong>&gt;&lt;</strong></p><p></p>
