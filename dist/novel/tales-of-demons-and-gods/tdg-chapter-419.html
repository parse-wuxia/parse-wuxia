<p><strong>Chapter 419 - Set Off</strong></p><p>Skysoul Institute</p><p>Inside Li Xingyun&#x2019;s yard</p><p>&#x201C;Boss Nie Li, Gu Bei, and Lu Piao, you&#x2019;re finally back!&#x201D; The moment they saw Nie Li, the people of the Demon League all teared up. These past few days had been extremely sullen for them.</p><p>Nie Li frowned when he saw the bitter expressions of his Demon League and Heavenly Path League comrades. &#x201C;What happened?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;It&#x2019;s like this&#x2026;!&#x201D; Li Xingyun began explaining what&#x2019;d happened during the past few days.</p><p>He kept his brows knitted as he said in a solemn voice, &#x201C;I think there&#x2019;s something fishy going on with Li Yufeng. He suddenly gained so many experts out of nowhere. There&#x2019;s definitely someone behind him, but I don&#x2019;t know who it is!&#x201D;</p><p>Nie Li frowned. &#x201C;He suddenly gained a lot of experts?&#x201D; Could it be Long Tianming?</p><p>From his perspective, it was mostly likely Long Tianming. That guy had always been shrouded in mystery. Even Nie Li couldn&#x2019;t see through him.</p><p>According to the Dragonseal Family hierarchy, Long Tianming wasn&#x2019;t the son of the first wife. But he&#x2019;d still been able to climb up to the Sect Master&#x2019;s position back in Nie Li&#x2019;s previous life. That wasn&#x2019;t something easy to do. There must be something deeper.</p><p>Long Tianming had only shown a small portion of his power. Nie Li still didn&#x2019;t know how much more Long Tianming has concealed under his sleeves.</p><p>It looked like he&#x2019;d have to deal with Long Tianming soon. But the current him didn&#x2019;t have enough strength to do that.</p><p>Nie Li spoke after pausing, &#x201C;If we move out, then Li Yufeng will probably move to intercept us. We don&#x2019;t have enough trump cards to use against them. I thought about it a little. Gu Bei, Lu Piao, Li Xingyun. For now, you guys should handle the matters inside the Skysoul Institute. I&#x2019;ll make a trip to the town at the edge of the Endless Wilderness!&#x201D;</p><p>Gu Bei, Lu Piao and Li Xingyun exchanged glances and asked, &#x201C;Do you want someone to go with you?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;I&#x2019;ll be fine!&#x201D; Nie Li smiled as he shook his head, &#x201C;Don&#x2019;t forget, I&#x2019;m already at the pinnacle of the Heavenly Star Realm. On top of that, I have a God-level growth rate Demon Spirit. Even if I encounters a Heavenly Axis Realm expert, I&#x2019;ll also be able to handle them. But even if I can&#x2019;t, I can still escape.&#x201D;</p><p>Gu Bei considered his words, then nodded. &#x201C;Alright then, be careful.&#x201D;</p><p>Nie Li smiled. &#x201C;Rest assured. There won&#x2019;t be any peculiar dangers in that place!&#x201D;</p><p>Lu Piao also considered those words, then excitedly added, &#x201C;It&#x2019;ll be best if we can kidnap a Dao of Dragon Realm expert. That way, our strength will be greatly enhanced!&#x201D;</p><p>Nie Li said, &#x201C;I&#x2019;ll go ahead and scout the area.&#x201D;</p><p>Recruiting members of the Sky Origin Divine Clan was still an issue. Those people were extremely cautious in choosing masters. They wouldn&#x2019;t sell themselves so easily to someone they couldn&#x2019;t trust. Price was secondary: fifty or sixty thousand spiritual stones. But even if it was higher, Nie Li could still afford it.</p><p>Li Xingyun nodded. &#x201C;Alright. Nie Li will scout the area.&#x201D; After all, this wasn&#x2019;t something that could be settled in just one or two days.</p><p>After their discussion, Nie Li made his preparations to head out.</p><p>Suddenly, a figure rushed in and ran straight into Nie Li.</p><p>Nie Li immediately caught the person who&#x2019;d stumbled. It was Long Yuyin.</p><p>Her clothes perfectly outlined her impressive figure. When they bumped into each other, Nie Li became distinctly aware of the softness of her chest. He couldn&#x2019;t help feeling a little awkward. Long Yuyin was blushed red and her chest heaved. Anyone would find it hard to look away.</p><p>Long Yuyin had walked straight into Nie Li.</p><p>&#x201C;Cough cough...&#x201D; Li Xingyun, Gu Bei, and Lu Piao coughed and turned their faces away.</p><p>Nie Li laughed awkwardly, &#x201C;Why are you here?&#x201D;</p><p>Long Yuyin looked at him with a resentful, yet nervous expression. &#x201C;Master, you&#x2019;ve returned and you didn&#x2019;t send anyone to inform me!&#x201D;</p><p>She didn&#x2019;t know where to put her hands.</p><p>Li Xingyun, Gu Bei, and Lu Piao opened their eyes so wide they almost fell out. Was she still the same Long Yuyin? That rumored tigress? The contrast was too much.</p><p>Nie Li smiled. &#x201C;I just got back. I didn&#x2019;t get a chance to inform you.&#x201D;</p><p>Long Yuyin raised her head and stared at him with bright eyes. &#x201C;Is Master going out again?&#x201D;</p><p>Long Yuyin looked at the outline of Nie Li&#x2019;s face. She didn&#x2019;t know why, but her heart rate quickened a little. While Nie Li was gone, she&#x2019;d sent quite a few people to check on when he&#x2019;d be back. She didn&#x2019;t know why, but his image often flashed through her mind. Too many things were going through her head. She thought about when Nie Li had lashed her three times. She could never forget about that. She could still feel that burning sensation.</p><p>Before, she hated Nie Li so much that she&#x2019;d gnash her teeth. But she no longer hated him anymore. However, those three lashes were imprinted into her memory.</p><p>&#x201C;Yes, I&#x2019;m going somewhere.&#x201D; Nie Li knew that lies wouldn&#x2019;t work. Long Yuyin had probably already guess it.</p><p>&#x201C;Can I go with you?&#x201D; Long Yuyin looked at him with a hopeful expression. She didn&#x2019;t know why, but she knew her heart would be agitated if she went another day without him.</p><p>Nie Li shook his head, &#x201C;It&#x2019;s just a short trip, and I&#x2019;ll be back soon. I can go by myself!&#x201D;</p><p>Long Yuyin pouted and felt a little unresigned.</p><p>Nie Li looked at her solemnly. &#x201C;So now you&#x2019;re not going to listen to your own master!&#x201D;</p><p>Long Yuyin finally shook her head, then nodded. &#x201C;Alright then.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;I&#x2019;ll leave Long Tianming to you. Pay attention to every single one of his moves.&#x201D; Nie Li looked at Long Yuyin and continued, &#x201C;I feel that Long Tianming is someone sent from the Demon God&#x2019;s Sect, although I have yet to find any solid evidence!&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Someone from the Demon God&#x2019;s Sect?&#x201D; Long Yuyin was confused.</p><p>&#x201C;Yeah.&#x201D; Nie Li nodded.</p><p>Why would Nie Li suspect that Long Tianming was someone from the Demon God&#x2019;s Sect? Long Yuyin was curious. However, Nie Li wasn&#x2019;t someone who&#x2019;d shoot without aim. He&#x2019;d already put his words down. He must have noticed something.</p><p>&#x201C;I&#x2019;ll have someone watch Long Tianming.&#x201D; Long Yuyin nodded seriously. If Long Tianming really was from the Demon God&#x2019;s Sect, then it&#x2019;d be a severe problem! After all, Long Tianming wasn&#x2019;t just a successor of the Dragonseal Family, but also a competitor for the Sect Master&#x2019;s position of the Divine Feathers Sect!</p><p>&#x201C;Yeah, just keep a close eye on him. You don&#x2019;t have to do anything else. If anything, wait for me to return.&#x201D; said Nie Li.</p><p>&#x201C;Okay, I understand.&#x201D; Long Yuyin nodded again.</p><p></p><hr><p></p><p></p><p style="text-align: center"><strong>&gt;&lt;</strong></p><p></p>
