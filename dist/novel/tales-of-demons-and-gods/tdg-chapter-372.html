<p><strong>Chapter 372 - Origins</strong></p><p>Now that Nie Li and Xiao Yu had safely escaped, the others rejoiced!</p><p>What else did they have to worry about?</p><p>&#x201C;Everyone, retreat!&#x201D; Li Xingyun barked.</p><p>The Demon League and Heavenly Path League split into dozens of smaller groups and charged out, retreating while fighting off their enemies.</p><p>Gu Heng led his men in a chase for a few hundred kilometres. Although both sides had suffered quite a few losses, at least half of the Heavenly Path and Demon Leagues&#x2019; combined forces managed to retreat safely. Gu Heng could only watch as they escaped.</p><p>A quick count told Gu Heng that the Heavenly Path and Demon Leagues had suffered a total of five thousand casualties, while he&#x2019;d suffered six thousand. Li Yufueng had also suffered over a thousand deaths.</p><p>Three of his Deity&#x2019;s Lakes were gone and he&#x2019;d suffered more losses in personnel than his enemies. Gu Heng was extremely depressed.</p><p>He looked out at the horizon, in the direction that the Heavenly Path and Demon Leagues had escaped to, and rays of wrath flashed through his eyes. &#x201C;If we were only killing each other out of hatred, then maybe the family elders wouldn&#x2019;t be bothered over it. However, I don&#x2019;t think that&#x2019;s the case anymore, since you dared to commit actions like destroying Deity&#x2019;s Lakes! Gu Bei, let&#x2019;s see if your position as first-in-line successor is still stable!&#x201D;</p><p>Gu Heng led a group of men and rushed back to the Divine Feathers Sect.</p><p>He definitely had to get the elders riled up about this, then make them impeach Gu Bei!</p><p>Destroying three of his Deity&#x2019;s Lakes was just too vicious a move. He definitely had to make Gu Bei pay the price!</p><p>One day later, Skysoul Institute, Gu Bei&#x2019;s courtyard</p><p>Gu Bei, Li Xingyun, and Lu Piao were gathered together.</p><p>Gu Bei frowned and questioned, &#x201C;Why isn&#x2019;t Nie Li back, yet?&#x201D;</p><p>Li Xingyun smiled. &#x201C;Xiao Yu unleashed a mysterious inscription pattern array at the last minute to save them. It looked like some kind of space-time array. Since they&#x2019;ve already stored their fate souls, they&#x2019;ll only be able to die once before they return. There&#x2019;s nothing to worry about!&#x201D;</p><p>Since the outside world was so vast, sending out a search party wouldn&#x2019;t be a good idea.</p><p>Gu Bei nodded. &#x201C;Alright then. Let&#x2019;s just forget about it for now!&#x201D;</p><p>Lu Piao wasn&#x2019;t worried for Nie Li in the slightest.</p><p>They began discussing the arrangements for compensating the members of the Heavenly Path and Demon Leagues who&#x2019;d died. Suddenly, a servant anxiously walked in. That servant&#x2019;s name was Gu Teng. He was one of Gu Bei&#x2019;s direct subordinates.</p><p>&#x201C;Master Bei, I just received news that Gu Heng is trying to contact the elders of the Gu Clan to impeach you!&#x201D; Gu Teng anxiously reported.</p><p>&#x201C;Impeach me?&#x201D; Gu Bei was stunned for a moment.</p><p>&#x201C;It seems to be about the destruction of their three Deity&#x2019;s Lakes!&#x201D; Gu Teng reported.</p><p>Gu Bei furrowed his brows briefly. Indeed, there&#x2019;d never been a precedent for destroying a Deity&#x2019;s Lake. Perhaps they really had gone a little too far this time. But what about the fact that Gu Heng had poisoned his sister? That was even more vicious. This was &#x201C;an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth&#x201D;.</p><p>&#x201C;How does Gu Heng plan to accomplish his goal&#x201D; Gu Bei asked with furrowed brows. If Gu Heng was going to play petty tricks, then Gu Bei would have to guard against them!</p><p>Both Li Xingyun and Lu Piao were listening beside them. This was part of the Gu Clan&#x2019;s internal affairs; outsiders like themselves wouldn&#x2019;t be able to provide much help. They could only help him come up with ideas.</p><p>&#x201C;Gu Heng has gathered dozens of elders and is preparing to pressure the Patriarch. They want you to either give up your position as first-in-line successor, or compensate for the loss of three Deity&#x2019;s Lakes. One of those elders actually supports Miss Gu Lan and secretly told this news to the Young Miss. Young Miss then asked me to pass the message to you!&#x201D; Gu Teng said.</p><p>A chilling ray flashed through Gu Bei&#x2019;s eyes. Before he&#x2019;d displayed his strength, Gu Heng had been the first-in-line successor; therefore, many elders had good relationships with Gu Heng. After Gu Bei had destroyed three of Gu Heng&#x2019;s Deity&#x2019;s Lakes, Gu Heng wasn&#x2019;t resigned; he was trying to use the clan&#x2019;s power to deal with Gu Bei!</p><p>&#x201C;Gu Bei, what are you going to do?&#x201D; Lu Piao asked.</p><p>Gu Bei went silent for a moment, then said, &#x201C;I already have an idea! Gu Teng, go investigate which elders Gu Heng has contacted!&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Yes!&#x201D; Gu Teng bowed and replied.</p><p>Gu Bei busied himself.</p><p>The outside world, a mysterious and hidden valley</p><p>Surrounded by towering, precipitous cliffs was a valley, flourishing with grasses and flowers. A small spring flowed out from a densely packed forest. The Heavenly Energy was especially rich in this area.</p><p>Nie Li didn&#x2019;t know how far he was from the Divine Feathers Sect. He&#x2019;d never been here before, not even in his previous life.</p><p>After Xiao Yu had activated the space-time array in his ring, he and Nie Li suddenly appeared in this valley. They&#x2019;d shaken Gu Heng off their trail, but Xiao Yu had suffered severe, almost fatal, injuries from the dragon flames.</p><p>Xiao Yu only had a 5-fate cultivation. His entire body had been charred black by the dragon flames, and his life was hanging by a thread. With his current cultivation, recovery wouldn&#x2019;t be easy.</p><p>Nie Li should&#x2019;ve bought a set of Grade 6 armour for Xiao Yu, too. He couldn&#x2019;t help feeling guilty about that.</p><p>Xiao Yu struggle to sit upright, and leaned on a big tree to do so. He forced his head up to look at Nie Li and weakly said, &#x201C;Healing these wounds is too difficult for me, especially in this state. Kill me. That way, I can revive back in the Soul Hall!&#x201D;</p><p>Nie Li squatted down next to Xiao Yu, inspected his wounds, and confidently replied, &#x201C;You wounds might be heavy, but recovery isn&#x2019;t impossible! As long as your soul realm hasn&#x2019;t collapsed, I can do it!&#x201D;</p><p>Xiao Yu showed an embarrassed expression and said, &#x201C;Forget it!&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;There still a chance! Why are you giving up?&#x201D; Nie Li said in confusion. He looked at Xiao Yu&#x2019;s ring and said, &#x201C;I never thought you&#x2019;d have this sort of hidden method up your sleeve. It looks like an ancient space-time attributed ancient artifact. I actually don&#x2019;t recognise it! It looks like it&#x2019;s connected to your blood and is a part of you.&#x201D;</p><p>Xiao Yu lowered his head and looked at the ring on his finger. Then, he shifted his eyes and gazed off into the distance, &#x201C;I&#x2019;m an orphan, adopted by my foster father. Back then, I was still a infant who knew nothing. Everything that was related to my birth is gone. Only this ring was left behind. The ring is extremely important to me &#x2014; it&#x2019;s the only proof of my existence in this world!&#x201D;</p><p>Nie Li shook his head at Xiao Yu&#x2019;s words. &#x201C;A person&#x2019;s existence isn&#x2019;t something that can be proven with just an item. Have you heard the saying before? &#x201C;Like the empty air; life is as tranquil as a blooming flower; all is fleeting and illusory; let your heart be as clear as a mirror&#x201D;[1. Live life with a happy heart. Experience things with an open mind and unwavering determination. Face the world with a tranquil heart.]. Everyone is born into this world empty-handed. Your existence doesn&#x2019;t any proof. Live life with a merry heart and appreciate what is there! Things like origins aren&#x2019;t that important!&#x201D;</p><p>Xiao Yu looked at Nie Li with a dumbfounded expression. Although Nie Li was younger than he was, Nie Li sounded like a sage who&#x2019;d already seen through the illusions of life into reality. Xiao Yu&#x2019;s desolate heart found comfort in Nie Li&#x2019;s consolation.</p><p>Xiao Yu looked at the ring on his finger and said in a serious tone, &#x201C;I understand your meaning. I&#x2019;ll take your advice and appreciate life. But I still want to know of my origins!&#x201D;</p><p></p><hr><p></p><p></p><p style="text-align: center"><strong>&gt;&lt;</strong></p><p></p>
