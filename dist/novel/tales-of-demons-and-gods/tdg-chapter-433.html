<p><strong>Chapter 433 - Acting Sect Master?</strong></p><p>It was a total transformation!</p><p>The frighteningly potent medicinal effects rushed into his soul realm, as if trying to burst it. None of the elixirs he&#x2019;d ever taken before could compare to the effects of this one!</p><p>Lu Piao turned pale from shock. If the medicinal effects swelled and burst his soul realm, he&#x2019;d be a goner!</p><p>What&#x2019;s the point in trying to raise your cultivation if you&#x2019;re already dead?</p><p>However, the medicine simultaneously nourished Lu Piao&#x2019;s soul realm, restoring it.</p><p>In addition to its potent medicinal effects, this elixir could actually nourish the soul realm!</p><p>Lu Piao was amazed. He could feel his cultivation rise through the Heavenly Axis Realm. 1-stage, 2-stage&#x2026; at last, it stopped at the 5-stage Heavenly Axis Realm.</p><p>Great heavens! What kind of heaven-defying elixir was this!</p><p>The effects were simply too astonishing!</p><p>Just one elixir had raised his cultivation by so much. If he took a couple more, wouldn&#x2019;t he become even more powerful?</p><p>Li Xingyun, Gu Bei and the rest stood to the side, staring at Nie Li in shock. They swallowed to try and regain their composure. This was simply too terrifying.</p><p>They obviously sensed Lu Piao&#x2019;s sudden rise in cultivation. How long did that take? And it was all due to one tiny elixir!</p><p>Nie Li showed a faint smile. He&#x2019;d already expected Lu Piao&#x2019;s sudden rise in cultivation. After all, that elixir had been crafted from a Divine Phaseless Fruit left behind from an Emperor-level expert&#x2019;s private collection! For cultivators of their level, it was beyond supreme immortal medicine!</p><p>&#x201C;Nie Li, quick, give me one!&#x201D; Li Xingyun impatiently demanded.</p><p>There probably wasn&#x2019;t a single person in the Divine Feathers Sect who wouldn&#x2019;t be impatient after seeing Lu Piao&#x2019;s sudden rise in cultivation!</p><p>Nie Li distributed all the refined elixirs that he had on hand. Then, he entered the Myriad Miles Rivers and Mountains Painting and distributed the rest to his Sky Origin Divine Clan experts.</p><p>After everyone received their share of the elixirs, they began cultivating with full concentration.</p><p>For the next month or so, the people of the Demon, Heavenly Path, and Profound Note Leagues all stayed inside the Skysoul Institute. Regardless of how badly Gu Heng&#x2019;s subordinates mocked them, not a single expert left the grounds. It seemed as if the core members of these leagues had all gone missing.</p><p>The absence of the core members was an extremely demoralising blow to the exterior members of the leagues. Many of them simply chose to leave and join Gu Heng&#x2019;s camp instead.</p><p>A certain courtyard in the Skysoul Institute</p><p>&#x201C;He Yuan, this doesn&#x2019;t seem right. We shouldn&#x2019;t be doing this, should we?&#x201D; someone weakly protested. He was a slender twenty-six or twenty-seven year-old man who wore white silk clothes.</p><p>That person called He Yuan was a man with many scars. He coldly laughed, &#x201C;Doesn&#x2019;t seem right? Why did we join the Demon League in the first place? Wasn&#x2019;t it because we saw potential in the Demon League, and the fact that they offered such generous conditions? But look at it now. Who knows where the core members have gone? They&#x2019;ve probably holed themselves up like turtles. What&#x2019;s the point in staying there?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;It&#x2019;s fine that we&#x2019;re leaving, but to take over two hundred brothers with us&#x2026;&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Haha, a man seeks his way up just as water seeks its way down. Look at the situation. The Demon League won&#x2019;t be able to hold on much longer. Besides, Gu Heng has given us rather decent terms. By taking these brothers with us, we&#x2019;ll be able to negotiate the terms. If it was just the two of us, do you really think Gu Heng would bother?&#x201D; He Yuan sneered.</p><p>Ever since the core members of the Demon League had disappeared, the hearts of the exterior members had been riled. He Yuan only needed to do a little bit of convincing before two hundred of them were willing to leave with him.</p><p>Of course Gu Heng would be willing to accept traitors of the Demon League. Furthermore, he was providing them with ample conditions.</p><p>The slim youth thought about it and ground his teeth. &#x201C;Fine. We&#x2019;ll leave, since the Demon League no longer has any prospects!&#x201D;</p><p>Aside from the few hundred who&#x2019;d become Gu Heng&#x2019;s subordinates, there were thousands of others who&#x2019;d also decided to leave.</p><p>In reality, Nie Li had always been paying close attention to the state of the Demon League. He&#x2019;d already given elixirs to the fully trustworthy core members. However, he was still in the process of observing the exterior members. To those who&#x2019;d decided to turn to Gu Heng, or to leave entirely, Nie Li had done nothing. He simply allowed them to leave.</p><p>Even though there were many who&#x2019;d left, there were still many who&#x2019;d stayed.</p><p>After such a commotion, most of the remaining members should be worth nurturing!</p><p>Nie Li had secretly been reorganizing things, starting by cleaning out the spies in his Demon League. As for those who he finally deemed trustworthy, he brought them in and secretly nurtured them.</p><p>The Skysoul Institute was in a lull of tranquility. Gu Heng was pleased with the idea that the Demon, Heavenly Path, and Profound Note Leagues had seemingly given in. He began recruiting in large numbers and also announced that he&#x2019;d reclaim his position as the first-in-line successor from Gu Bei. As for the Ashen Flames Family&#x2019;s Li Yufeng, he also announced that he&#x2019;d soon become the Acting Patriarch for the Ashen Flames Family.</p><p>As for Long Tianming, even though he didn&#x2019;t show any movements, rumors had it that he was working towards becoming the Acting Sect Master of the Divine Feathers Sect.</p><p>The older generations hid themselves behind the scenes and focused on cultivating and strengthening the Divine Feathers Sect&#x2019;s foundation. They couldn&#x2019;t care less about such trifling matters that were going on. Such things were better left to the younger generations.</p><p>All the while, Nie Li continued to enhance his cultivation and observe the changes within the Divine Feathers Sect. Regardless of how turbulent the situation might be, everything would be fine as long the Demon League grew stronger. Aside from cultivating every day, Nie Li also occasionally paid visits to the Skycloud Hall to share his thoughts with Hierarch Skycloud. The latter had already developed an extreme trust in Nie Li.</p><p>Divine Feathers Sect, Skycloud Hall</p><p>&#x201C;Nie Li, you said that you want to fight for the Acting Sect Master&#x2019;s position?&#x201D;&#x2019; Hierarch Skycloud asked with a look of blank.</p><p>&#x201C;Yes!&#x201D; Nie Li said resolutely. &#x201C;Right now, the Demon God&#x2019;s Sect is pressuring hard on us. If Long Tianming takes control, I fear that the Divine Feathers Sect will spiral into an ever greater crisis. That&#x2019;s why I wish to stand out and fight to become the Acting Sect Master!&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;But you simply do not have much of a chance at success! Your foundation inside the Divine Feathers Sect is too shallow. So many of the Divine Feathers Sect disciples don&#x2019;t even know who you are. How do you plan to fight to become the Acting Sect Master? True, you are my disciple and you have my support; however, within the vast boundaries of the Divine Feathers Sect, my support will not be enough!&#x201D; Hierarch Skycloud explained with a smile and the shake of a head. Nie Li was indulging in a fantasy. &#x201C;I know you have great plans in your heart; furthermore, you possess an extraordinary talent. However, the position of Acting Sect Master is still beyond you!&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;If I gain control of the Divine Feathers Sect, then the sect will definitely welcome a new golden age. I only wish to know if Master will firmly support me!&#x201D; Nie Li requested as he looked at Hierarch Skycloud. Hierarch Skycloud probably still had some doubts in his ability.</p><p>Hierarch Skycloud remained silent for a moment, and truthfully was rather surprised. Nie Li appeared so confident.</p><p>Could it really be possible&#x2026;? Hierarch Skycloud quietly sat in his chair. After a brief moment of silence, he spoke. &#x201C;I&#x2019;m afraid that even I cannot firmly support you. As for the other Hierarchs, it&#x2019;ll be even more impossible!&#x201D;</p><p>Nie Li firmly replied, &#x201C;As long as Master supports me, then I have the confidence.&#x201D;</p><p></p><hr><p></p><p></p><p style="text-align: center"><strong>&gt;&lt;</strong></p><p></p>
