<p><strong>Chapter 427 - Fleeing</strong></p><p>*Woosh!* *Woosh!* *Woosh!*</p><p>Several sharp blasts tore through the sky and shot towards the two women behind Long Yuyin.</p><p>A dragon&#x2019;s roar pierced the sky.</p><p>One of the women integrated with a Crimson Blaze Winged Dragon and made a huge palm against those chilling beams of light.</p><p>However, the chilly light only sped up.</p><p>*Pfft!* *Pfft!* *Pfft!*</p><p>The chilling light pierced through the Crimson Blaze Winged Dragon. Fresh blood splattered.</p><p>&#x201C;Aoooow!&#x201D; The Crimson Blaze Winged Dragon issued a miserable shriek.</p><p>The Crimson Blaze Winged Dragon turned back into a human and fell from the sky.</p><p>&#x201C;Aunt Xie!&#x201D; Long Yuyin wailed. But the other woman picked her up and flew on.</p><p>&#x201C;Young Miss, you must take good care of yourself. Our opponent is at least of the 6-stage Dao of Dragon Realm. Even if we gave it our all, we wouldn&#x2019;t be able to hold him back!&#x201D; the woman anxiously said to Long Yuyin as they flew on.</p><p>Once a Dao of Dragon Realm expert fell in battle, rescue was impossible!</p><p>Beams of light pierced the sky, chasing after Long Yuyin&#x2019;s escape.</p><p>At this moment, in an inn in the small town</p><p>Nie Li had finished cultivating and had just stepped out of the inn. The Sky Origin Divine Clan experts were still inside the Myriad Miles Rivers and Mountains Painting. It was time for him to return to the Divine Feathers Sect.</p><p>Nie Li had spent the past few days buying all the Sky Origin Divine Clan experts that were for sale. There was nothing left for him to do here.</p><p>As he stepped out of the inn, he noticed several streaks of light in the sky.</p><p>Was that Long Yuyin? Several black-clad men were chasing after Long Yuyin&#x2019;s group of two.</p><p>The woman who was following Long Yuyin knew that their pursuers were about to catch up, so she shoved Long Yuyin out of harm&#x2019;s way.</p><p>&#x201C;Little Miss, please take care of yourself. I&#x2019;ll hold them back!&#x201D; After uttering those words, she transformed into a Blizzard Draconic Bird and faced the black-clad men. The temperature immediately plummeted.</p><p>Nie Li furrowed his brows. Black and white wings appeared behind him and he shot towards Long Yuyin.</p><p>The moment the Blizzard Draconic Bird appeared, the image of a massive sword also appeared in the sky. The blade slashed downwards, swallowing the Blizzard Draconic Bird.</p><p>&#x201C;Aunt Lin!&#x201D; Long Yuyin&#x2019;s eyes flickered with tears. She wanted to throw herself at those black-clad men.</p><p>As those thoughts crossed Long Yuyin&#x2019;s mind, Nie Li landed right next to her, took her hand, and led her away.</p><p>&#x201C;Nie Li, Aunt Xie and Aunt Lin are dead!&#x201D; When Long Yuyin saw Nie Li, her tears became an undammed river, rushing and unstoppable.</p><p>&#x201C;Right now, let&#x2019;s focus on getting out of here. We&#x2019;ll talk about these things later!&#x201D; Nie Li flapped his wings and turned into a streak of light.</p><p>After those black-clad men killed the woman, they sprang forward and flew on.</p><p>&#x2018;I wonder where those people came from? I can&#x2019;t use the Myriad Miles Rivers and Mountains Painting right now. Otherwise, it might attract some unimaginable consequences!&#x2019; Nie Li thought to himself. The wings on his back beat more rapidly, propelling him forward.</p><p>Nie Li was pushing himself as fast as he could.</p><p>The black-clad Dao of Dragon men were close in pursuit. But even though they were also going as fast as they could, they couldn&#x2019;t catch up with Nie Li.</p><p>Even though Nie Li was only at the pinnacle of the Heavenly Star Realm, he wasn&#x2019;t any slower than the average Dao of Dragon Realm expert.</p><p>Ever since his cultivation increased, the speed boost from his Wings of Law had also increased by several fold. Nie Li turned into a black and white streak of light, tearing through the sky.</p><p>&#x201C;Where&#x2019;s that kid from? How is he so fast?&#x201D; The leader of the black-clad men was extremely enraged. He could sense that Nie Li was only a Heavenly Star Realm, but to think the kid was so fast!</p><p>A Heavenly Star Realm brat actually dared to steal a person from right under their noses?</p><p>&#x201C;You&#x2019;re asking for death!&#x201D; The black-clad man coldly barked. The sword in his hand turned into a beam of chilling light and shot towards Nie Li.</p><p>That sword contained extreme power and speed, closely following behind Nie Li.</p><p>The blade soared until it was almost upon him, a powerful and chilling aura on Nie Li&#x2019;s back. Nie Li felt his entire body freeze up.</p><p>Was he going to die here?</p><p>Nie Li furrowed his brows. If he died, his cultivation would drop even further. He couldn&#x2019;t afford the time!</p><p>&#x201C;No, I can&#x2019;t die! I can&#x2019;t let Long Yuyin die here, either!&#x201D; Nie Li knitted his brows. He didn&#x2019;t know why these men were after Long Yuyin, but he was certain that there was a bigger plot behind it all!</p><p>Nie Li frantically circulated his soul realm. As though it&#x2019;d received a summons, the Shadow Devil awoke in Nie Li&#x2019;s soul realm, and instantly poured a powerful surge of energy through its master. Nie Li&#x2019;s speed recieved an abrupt boost.</p><p>One after another, the Fanged Panda and the Bloodwing Saint Jiao-dragon also woke up and poured their energies into Nie Li&#x2019;s body.</p><p>Nie Li sensed the three energies and his speed exploded by at least three-fold.</p><p>Just a moment ago, the enemy&#x2019;s sword was almost upon Nie Li. But now, Nie Li had attained a speed equal to the sword&#x2019;s. As the sword continued to travel, it gradually began losing its speed. Nie Li, however, flew onwards as a streak of light.</p><p>The black-clad man caught up to his sword and retrieved it. He looked ahead and saw Nie Li pulling away, meter by meter. Finally, his target&#x2019;s figure vanished.</p><p>Just where had that brat come from? He only had a Heavenly Star Realm cultivation, but his speed had actually reached such a pinnacle degree! It was to the point that even the sword couldn&#x2019;t catch up to him! Just what was going on?</p><p>&#x201C;Boss, what are we going to do now? That kid ran pretty fast!&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Chase them down! I refuse to believe that he can keep running at that speed. With his cultivation, he definitely won&#x2019;t be able to hang on for much longer!&#x201D; The black-clothed man coldly ordered. He didn&#x2019;t believe that a Heavenly Star Realm could escape the pursuit of so many Dao of Dragon Realm experts. Especially with a woman in tow.</p><p>*Woosh!* *Woosh!* *Woosh!*</p><p>The black-clad man gave chase in the direction that Nie Li had vanished in.</p><p>Supported by the three energies, Nie Li bolted forward.</p><p>Long Yuyin, who was being towed along, was in utter shock. Nie Li was simply too fast. The wind whistled in her ears, and she couldn&#x2019;t sense a thing. The powerful wind pressed her clothes tightly against her body, outlining her curvy figure.</p><p>Nie Li was only a Heavenly Star Realm. How could he fly with such frightening speed?!</p><p>Indeed, Nie Li couldn&#x2019;t be judged with common sense.</p><p>Roughly half an hour later, Nie Li had left those black-clad men in the dust!</p><p></p><hr><p></p><p></p><p style="text-align: center"><strong>&gt;&lt;</strong></p><p></p>
