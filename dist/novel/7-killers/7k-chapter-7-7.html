<p><span style="background-color: initial; font-size: 0.875rem">Part 1</span></p><p>The rain was cold, light and thin.</p><p>Long thin strands of rain fluttered amongst the parasol trees in the courtyard. The rain entangled parasol leaves and gloomy hearts alike.</p><p>Dragon Fifth had reached the end of the long outer corridor, but he didn&#x2019;t walk out. He, too, was reluctant to get wet.</p><p>Liu Changjie walked up and stood behind him.</p><p>Dragon Fifth knew Liu Changjie was there, but he said nothing. Neither did Liu Changjie.</p><p>They stood there quietly at the end of the corridor, watching the rain fall on the parasol trees in. They stood there for a long time.</p><p>&#x201C;Power of Hu really is cruel.&#x201D; Dragon Fifth let out a long sigh. &#x201C;He is not only cruel to others, he is cruel to himself.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Perhaps because he is at the end of his road,&#x201D; said Liu Changjie indifferently.</p><p>&#x201C;And because he is at the end of the road, you&#x2019;re going to let him go?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;I&#x2019;m also a cruel person.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;No you&#x2019;re not.&#x201D;</p><p>Liu Changjie laughed, but it wasn&#x2019;t a happy laugh.</p><p>Dragon Fifth looked back at him. &#x201C;At the least, you will let him maintain his reputation.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Because his reputation wasn&#x2019;t stolen. He earned it through suffering and hard work.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;I can see that.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;I don&#x2019;t have any personal animosity toward him. I don&#x2019;t want to see his reputation ruined.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;But you&#x2019;re not bringing him to justice. You&#x2019;re not making him return the things he stole.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;No. I don&#x2019;t need to.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Don&#x2019;t need to?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;He is a very intelligent person. I don&#x2019;t need to make him. He should come to me himself to resolve the issue.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;And so you&#x2019;re waiting here for him to come.&#x201D;</p><p>Liu Changjie nodded.</p><p>&#x201C;And the case is still not closed.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Not yet.&#x201D;</p><p>Dragon Fifth muttered to himself for a moment, then said, &#x201C;If he&#x2019;s willing to return the stolen property, willing to solve all the problems himself, then the case will be closed.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;No.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Why?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;You should know why.&#x201D;</p><p>Dragon Fifth turned his head and gazed at the distant, dark clouds. After a long time he quietly said, &#x201C;You can&#x2019;t let Qiu Hengbo go.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;I can&#x2019;t.&#x201D; His face suddenly was filled with a very solemn look. &#x201C;No one can violate the law, or universal truths. Anyone who breaks the law must be punished.&#x201D;</p><p>Dragon Fifth looked back and stared at him. &#x201C;Who are you, really? Why are you investigating this matter?&#x201D;</p><p>Liu Changjie didn&#x2019;t reply.</p><p>&#x201C;You obviously are not who you say you are,&#x201D; said Dragon Fifth. &#x201C;But you also don&#x2019;t want to sell yourself out.&#x201D;</p><p>Liu Changjie said nothing.</p><p>&#x201C;Both Power of Hu and I investigated your background, yet neither of us found anything to indicate you were lying.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;You really don&#x2019;t understand?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;I really don&#x2019;t.&#x201D;</p><p>Liu Changjie laughed. &#x201C;When I encounter something I don&#x2019;t understand, I use a special method to deal with it.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;What method?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;When I don&#x2019;t understand something, I don&#x2019;t think about it. At least temporarily.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;And afterwards?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Whatever the secret it is, it will be revealed eventually. You just have to wait patiently, and eventually you will figure it out.&#x201D;</p><p>Dragon Fifth said nothing.</p><p>Maybe he couldn&#x2019;t stop thinking about it, but he could stop asking.</p><p>The rain fell in sheets, twilight grew deeper and deeper.</p><p>Light footsteps could be heard.</p><p>Then a hand was visible, carrying a lantern, walking slowly down the gloomy corridor.</p><p>The lamplight revealed a head of white hair, and the face of Power of Hu&#x2019;s faithful follower, the old doorman.</p><p>His face was expressionless.</p><p>He had long ago mastered the ability to conceal sorrow within his heart.</p><p>&#x201C;The two guests have not left yet?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;We haven&#x2019;t.&#x201D;</p><p>The old man nodded his head. &#x201C;Of course the two guests aren&#x2019;t gone. However, the master is gone.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;He&#x2019;s gone?&#x201D;</p><p>The old man stared at the curtains of falling rain. &#x201C;A storm may arise from a clear sky. People have mornings and evenings, disaster and happiness. I never thought that the master&#x2019;s sickness would flare up again so suddenly.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;He died of sickness?&#x201D;</p><p>The old man nodded his head. &#x201C;His rheumatism had long since seeped into his marrow. He&#x2019;s been a cripple for a long time, and to keep living down to this day hasn&#x2019;t been easy.&#x201D;</p><p>His face was completely expressionless, but within his eyes could be seen a strange expression. It was hard to say if he was grieving for Power of Hu, or begging Liu Changjie not to reveal his master&#x2019;s secret.</p><p>Liu Changjie looked at him, and finally nodded his head. &#x201C;Very well. So he died of sickness. I saw long ago that the disease was getting very serious.&#x201D;</p><p>An expression of gratitude filled his eyes, and he sighed. &#x201C;Thank you. You really are a good person. The master did not misjudge you.&#x201D;</p><p>Sighing again, he slowly turned and walked away down the corridor.</p><p>&#x201C;Where are you going?&#x201D; asked Liu Changjie.</p><p>&#x201C;To announce the master&#x2019;s death.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Where will you make the announcement?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;At Madam Autumn&#x2019;s.&#x201D; The man&#x2019;s voice was filled with resentment. &#x201C;If it wasn&#x2019;t for her, the master&#x2019;s illness might not have been so bad. Now that the master is gone, I will definitely make sure she knows.&#x201D;</p><p>Liu Changjie&#x2019;s eyes shone. &#x201C;Don&#x2019;t tell me she will come here to pay her respects?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;She will come.&#x201D; He spoke one word at a time. &#x201C;She must come.&#x201D;</p><p>The rain outside the corridor grew thicker and thicker.</p><p>The old man walked out of the corridor, and the lantern in his hand was instantly extinguished by the rain.</p><p>It seemed he didn&#x2019;t notice. Carrying the extinguished lantern, he slowly walked off into the darkness.</p><p>Night had fallen, enveloping everything in blackness.</p><p>After his crooked, emaciated frame disappeared into the night, Dragon Fifth let out a sigh. &#x201C;It seems you were correct. Power of Hu didn&#x2019;t disappoint.&#x201D;</p><p>Liu Changjie also sighed.</p><p>&#x201C;But,&#x201D; Dragon Fifth said, &#x201C;I still don&#x2019;t understand why Qiu Hengbo &#x2018;must&#x2019; come.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;I don&#x2019;t know either.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;So you&#x2019;re not going to think about it?&#x201D;</p><p>Liu Changjie laughed. &#x201C;Because I believe that in the end, all secrets will be revealed.&#x201D;</p><p>He turned and stared at Dragon Fifth. &#x201C;There&#x2019;s an expression I think you should never forget.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;What expression?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;&#x2018;Heaven&#x2019;s net is wide meshed, nothing escapes it. The way of Heaven is fair, but the guilty will not escape.&#x2019;&#x201D; His eyes shone in the darkness. &#x201C;Whoever commits crimes, they should each and every one forget about escaping justice.&#x201D;</p><p>Part 2</p><p>Dusk.</p><p>There is dusk every day, but every dusk is different.</p><p>Similarly, every person dies, and yet there are many types of death. Some people die bravely and with honor, others die in an ordinary and humble way.</p><p>Power of Hu&#x2019;s death was neither ordinary nor humble.</p><p>Many had come to his mourning hall to pay respects. Some were his disciples and friends, others merely came to because of his reputation. There was one person missing.</p><p>Madam Lovesickness had not arrived.</p><p>Liu Changjie wasn&#x2019;t anxious. He hadn&#x2019;t even asked about her.</p><p>And he hadn&#x2019;t stopped Dragon Fifth from leaving. He&#x2019;d known all along that Dragon Fifth would leave, the same as he knew Qiu Hengbo would arrive.</p><p>Dragon Fifth seeing her would only complicate matters.</p><p>Qiu Hengbo would come, so Dragon Fifth had no choice but to leave.</p><p>When seeing Dragon Fifth off, he&#x2019;d taken him to the end of the corridor and said, &#x201C;I&#x2019;ll definitely come looking for you.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;When? When will you come?&#x201D;</p><p>Liu Changjie laughed. &#x201C;When it&#x2019;s time to drink, of course.&#x201D;</p><p>Dragon Fifth laughed. &#x201C;I always drink at Heavenly Fragrance.&#x201D;</p><p>**</p><p>The mourning hall had been set up in the spacious, ancient main hall.</p><p>Liu Changjie was nowhere to be seen, only the white-haired old servant, along with effigies of a virgin boy and a virgin girl, keeping vigil over the coffin.</p><p>The night was deep.</p><p>Eerie lamplight shone onto the exhausted face of the old servant. He himself looked like an effigy.</p><p>Mourning couplets, written on strips of white cloth, were hung all about, and there were piles of paper effigies of houses, horses, ships, and other lucky objects.</p><p>These things had been gathered in preparation to be burned on the nights of &#x201C;Receiving the Third&#x201D; and &#x201C;Accompanying Night.&#x201D;&#xA0;</p><p>The effigy of the horse cart was remarkably true to life. It had a man leading the horses, a man driving the cart, even extra helpers, horse tackle and whips. Their livery and their faces were all extremely lifelike. It was unfortunate that Power of Hu couldn&#x2019;t see them.</p><p>The night wind was dull and desolate, the lamplight flickered, and then the shadow of a visitor floated into the room.</p><p>The visitor was wearing mourning clothes on top, and underneath, the dark clothes of someone who wishes to remain hidden at night.</p><p>The old servant raised his head and glanced at him. The man knelt down, and the old servant knelt alongside. He kowtowed, and the old servant kowtowed with him.</p><p>When a famous hero of the martial world like Power of Hu passes away, it&#x2019;s relatively common for unknown figures of the Jianghu world to come in the dead of night to pay respects.</p><p>It wasn&#x2019;t an unusual thing, and was nothing to be shocked about or to even ask questions about.</p><p>And yet, this night visitor asked, &#x201C;Master Hu is really dead?&#x201D;</p><p>The old servant nodded his head.</p><p>&#x201C;But the old man was fine just a few days ago. How could he suddenly pass away?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;A storm may arise from a clear sky,&#x201D; said the old servant gloomily. &#x201C;People have mornings and evenings, disaster and happiness. These matters, no one can predict.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;How did the old man pass?&#x201D; It seemed this passing visitor was very interested in Power of Hu&#x2019;s death.</p><p>&#x201C;He died of sickness. He had a very serious disease.&#x201D;</p><p>The visitor let out a long sigh. &#x201C;I didn&#x2019;t see the old man for such a long time. I had no idea I would never see him again.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Sadly, you were just a bit too late.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Would it be possible for me to pay homage to his remains?&#x201D; It seemed this visitor couldn&#x2019;t let go of the idea of seeing Power of Hu.</p><p>&#x201C;No.&#x201D; The old servant&#x2019;s response was very direct. &#x201C;Others can. You can&#x2019;t.&#x201D;</p><p>The visitor seemed shocked. &#x201C;Why not?&#x201D;</p><p>The old servant lowered his head. &#x201C;Because he didn&#x2019;t know you.&#x201D;</p><p>The visitor seemed more shocked. &#x201C;How do you know that he didn&#x2019;t know me?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Because I don&#x2019;t know you,&#x201D; replied the servant coldly.</p><p>&#x201C;So you know everyone he knew?&#x201D;</p><p>The old servant nodded.</p><p>The visitor also lowered his head. &#x201C;And if I&#x2019;m set on seeing him?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;I know that you don&#x2019;t want to see him,&#x201D; was the cold response. &#x201C;The person who wants to see him is someone else.&#x201D;</p><p>The visitor frowned. &#x201C;Do you know who does want to see him?&#x201D;</p><p>The old servant nodded again. With a cold laugh, he said, &#x201C;I&#x2019;m only confused about one thing.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;What&#x2019;s that?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Madam Autum doesn&#x2019;t think the master is dead, so she wants to see his corpse. Why didn&#x2019;t she come herself, instead of sending a Five Gates thief like you to harass his spirit?&#x201D;</p><p>The visitor&#x2019;s face changed. His hands flipped out to reveal a pair of poison-coated deerskin gloves.</p><p>The old servant refused to look at him.</p><p>The visitor laughed. &#x201C;Even if I&#x2019;m just a Five Gates thief, I can still take your life.&#x201D;</p><p>It seemed he really was ready to spring to action, but at that exact moment, a cold laugh could be heard. &#x201C;Shut your mouth and get out of here. Get the hell out!&#x201D;</p><p>**</p><p>The voice was mesmerizing, as mesmerizing as if it had emanated from heaven.</p><p>A third person could not be seen in the mourning hall, and it was impossible to tell where the voice came from.</p><p>The old servant did not seem shocked at all. His face was completely expressionless. &#x201C;So you finally came,&#x201D; he said coldly. &#x201C;I knew you would come.&#x201D;</p><p>Part 3</p><p>The visitor backed up step by step, until he was gone from the mourning hall.</p><p>Left behind was only the white-haired, haggard old servant, illuminated by the desolate, eerie lamp.</p><p>And then, the entire mourning hall was filled with a voice.</p><p>&#x201C;Justice of Hu.&#x201D; She was addressing the old servant by name. &#x201C;Since you knew I sent him here, why wouldn&#x2019;t you let him see the master&#x2019;s remains?&#x201D;</p><p>Justice of Hu&#x2019;s reply was just as clear-cut. &#x201C;Because he&#x2019;s not worthy.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;And me? Am I worthy?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;The master predicted that you wouldn&#x2019;t believe he was really dead.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Oh?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Therefore, he instructed me to wait for your arrival before sealing the coffin.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Don&#x2019;t tell me he wants to see me one more time, too?&#x201D; She was laughing.</p><p>Her laughter was both beautiful and sinister.</p><p>As the laughter was ringing out, the paper effigies suddenly shattered into millions of pieces.&#xA0;</p><p>Countless shreds of paper flitted about the mourning hall like colorful butterflies.</p><p>And within the flying butterflies, a person floated down, looking like a beautiful white flower that had just bloomed.</p><p>She wore a long, snow-white robe, and her face was covered with a white gauze veil. Her body looked like a white cloud that in an instant alighted in front of Justice of Hu.</p><p>His face was still completely expressionless&#x2014;he&#x2019;d known Madam Lovesickness would arrive.</p><p>He&#x2019;d known long ago, and had been waiting for her for a long time.</p><p>&#x201C;Can I look at the master&#x2019;s remains now?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Of course you can,&#x201D; said Justice of Hu calmly. &#x201C;Who knows, perhaps the master really did want to see you one more time.&#x201D;</p><p>**</p><p>The coffin was not sealed.</p><p>Power of Hu lay quietly within, seeming more serene and peaceful than he had in life.</p><p>Perhaps it was because he knew that no one in the world would ever again be able to force him to do things against his will.</p><p>Madam Lovesickness finally let out a soft sigh. &#x201C;It seems he really is gone.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;It seems you&#x2019;re happy he went first.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Because I know that dead people can&#x2019;t take anything with them when they go.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;He&#x2019;s definitely not taking anything with him.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;If he&#x2019;s not taking anything with him, then he should leave those things for me.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;What should be given to you has already been given.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Where?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Right here.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;And why don&#x2019;t I see anything?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Because what you promised to bring to him, is not here.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Even if I brought it, he couldn&#x2019;t see it.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;I could see it.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Unfortunately, I didn&#x2019;t promise you. Hu Yue&#x2019;er isn&#x2019;t your daughter!&#x201D;</p><p>Justice of Hu said nothing.</p><p>&#x201C;Where are the items?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Right here.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;I still don&#x2019;t see anything.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Because I don&#x2019;t see Hu Yue&#x2019;er.&#x201D;</p><p>Madam Lovesickness laughed coldly. &#x201C;I&#x2019;m afraid you&#x2019;ll never see her again.&#x201D;</p><p>Justice of Hu also laughed coldly. &#x201C;In that case, you&#x2019;ll never see the things you want.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;At the least, I can see one more thing.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Oh?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;At the least,&#x201D; she said coldly, &#x201C;I can see your head fall to the ground.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Sadly, my head isn&#x2019;t worth even one coin.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Worthless things are sometimes very desirable.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;In that case, come get it whenever you want.&#x201D;</p><p>Madam Lovesickness laughed. &#x201C;You know very well that I&#x2019;m not going to kill you.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Oh?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;As long as you have at least one breath left, there&#x2019;s still a way for me to get you to tell the truth.&#x201D;</p><p>Her hand suddenly flicked out like an orchid.</p><p>Justice of Hu didn&#x2019;t move.</p><p>Another hand suddenly shot out like lightning to meet hers.</p><p>There was no third person in the hall, so where did the hand come from. Could it be that it came from within the coffin?</p><p>The hand did not shoot out from the coffin.</p><p>It was neither a dead hand, nor a hand made from paper.</p><p>The effigies were already shattered into the countless shreds that still fluttered about like butterflies.</p><p>&#x201C;I was also waiting for your arrival.&#x201D; From within the fluttering butterflies appeared a smiling face.</p><p>Liu Changjie laughed.</p><p>But within his laughter could be heard an unspeakable pain.</p><p>Because, the energy of his palm strike had already lifted up Madam Lovesickness&#x2019;s gauze veil. He could finally lay eyes on her face.</p><p>From the very beginning, he would never have been able to guess that this gloomy, mysterious woman, was actually Hu Yue&#x2019;er.</p><p>Part 4</p><p>Dragon Fifth was wrapped up in a marten coat, reclining on the long, narrow couch. He stared at the deadwoods outside the window and muttered, &#x201C;How come it hasn&#x2019;t snowed at all this year?&#x201D;</p><p>No one responded to him, and he didn&#x2019;t expect anyone to.</p><p>Qin Huhua didn&#x2019;t speak very often.</p><p>When a person begins to talk to oneself, it indicates that they are beginning to grow old.</p><p>Dragon Fifth had heard this saying before, but forgot who said it.</p><p>&#x201C;Don&#x2019;t tell me I really am growing old?&#x201D;</p><p>He felt at the wrinkles in the corners of his eyes, and suddenly an indescribable feeling of loneliness welled up from his heart.</p><p>Qin Huhua was warming wine for him.</p><p>He seldom drank wine, but lately he had been drinking two cups every day.</p><p>&#x2014;When will you come?</p><p>&#x2014;When it&#x2019;s time to drink, of course.</p><p>Suddenly, the light sound of footfalls could be heard from outside. A waiter appeared, wearing dark green clothes and a small cap. He carried a small platter, upon which was a soup bowl, covered.</p><p>Dragon Fifth turned his head and suddenly laughed. &#x201C;Are there three hands in the soup bowl this time?&#x201D;</p><p>**</p><p>It was Liu Changjie.</p><p>Smiling, he lifted the lid of the soup bowl and said, &#x201C;There&#x2019;s only one hand in here, a left hand.&#x201D;</p><p>Inside the soup bowl was the paw of a bear, which Dragon Fifth had ordered earlier, and had been slowly cooked for an entire day.</p><p>The wine was warmed.</p><p>&#x201C;I knew you would come,&#x201D; laughed Dragon Fifth. &#x201C;You came just at the right time.&#x201D;</p><p>Qin Huhua had already filled two cups.</p><p>&#x201C;You&#x2019;re not drinking?&#x201D; Liu Changjie asked him.</p><p>Qin Huhua shook his head.</p><p>He glanced at Liu Changjie and then turned his head, his face expressionless.</p><p>Liu Changjie gazed at him and suddenly thought of the white-haired, haggard old servant, the man with a face like a dead tree, Justice of Hu.</p><p>Every time he looked at Justice of Hu, he couldn&#x2019;t help but think of Qin Huhua.</p><p>Could it be because they were the same type of person? Anyone who tried to guess their thoughts from the expressions on their faces, would never succeed.</p><p>What was Liu Changjie thinking now?</p><p>He was smiling, but the smile was dim, just like the overcast weather outside.</p><p>&#x201C;This really is good weather for drinking.&#x201D;</p><p>Dragon Fifth looked back at him, smiling. &#x201C;So I prepared a pot of wine, especially for you.&#x201D;</p><p>Liu Changjie drank a cup. &#x201C;And it&#x2019;s good wine.&#x201D;</p><p>He sat down, and his smile brightened a bit. A cup of quality wine will always brighten the spirits.</p><p>Dragon Fifth stared at him. &#x201C;You just arrived?&#x201D; he asked.</p><p>&#x201C;Yes.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;I thought you would arrive a few days ago.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;I &#x2026; I arrived late.&#x201D;</p><p>Dragon Fifth laughed. &#x201C;Arriving late is better than not arriving at all.&#x201D;</p><p>Liu Changjie sat silently for a long time, thinking.</p><p>&#x201C;You&#x2019;re wrong,&#x201D; he said suddenly. &#x201C;Sometimes not arriving at all is actually better.&#x201D;</p><p>He obviously was not talking about himself.</p><p>&#x201C;Who are you talking about?&#x201D; asked Dragon Fifth.</p><p>Liu Changjie drank another cup. &#x201C;You should know who I&#x2019;m talking about.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;She really appeared?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Yes.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;You saw her?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Yes.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;And you recognized her?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Yes.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Don&#x2019;t tell me she really was Hu Yue&#x2019;er?&#x201D;</p><p>Liu Changjie downed his fifth cup. &#x201C;She obviously wasn&#x2019;t the real Hu Yue&#x2019;er.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;You&#x2019;ve never seen the real Hu Yue&#x2019;er, have you?&#x201D;</p><p>Liu Changjie nodded, and finished his sixth cup.</p><p>Dragon Fifth continued, &#x201C;She abducted the real Hu Yue&#x2019;er and used her to blackmail Power of Hu, then impersonated her to meet with you.&#x201D;</p><p>Liu Changjie downed the seventh cup. &#x201C;Do you want to know what happened to her in the end?&#x201D; he asked suddenly.</p><p>&#x201C;Not really.&#x201D; He was smiling, but the smile was even more gloomy than the weather outside. &#x201C;I knew a long time ago what kind of person she is.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;But you don&#x2019;t know what happened to her in the end.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;I don&#x2019;t need to know. A person&#x2019;s nature will dictate their end.&#x201D; He forced out a laugh. &#x201C;Heaven&#x2019;s net is wide meshed, nothing escapes it. The way of Heaven is fair, but the guilty will not escape. I haven&#x2019;t forgotten this.&#x201D;</p><p>Liu Changjie wanted to laugh, but couldn&#x2019;t. He had drunk all the wine in the jug.</p><p>Dragon Fifth drank a cup. &#x201C;I never could figure out what kind of person that old man was.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;You mean Justice of Hu?&#x201D;</p><p>Dragon Fifth nodded. &#x201C;I actually suspected that he was the real Power of Hu.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Ah?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;In fact, I even suspected that they were the same person.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;I don&#x2019;t understand.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Did you ever hear the story of a person in Jianghu called &#x2018;the Ouyang Brothers?&#x2019;&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;I have heard.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;The Ouyang brothers weren&#x2019;t actually two people. He was a man whose name was &#x2018;the Ouyang Brothers.&#x2019;&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Yes, I remember.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;The Ouyang Brothers was actually one person. Couldn&#x2019;t it be possible that Power of Hu was actually two people?&#x201D;</p><p>Liu Changjie finally caught on.</p><p>&#x201C;Did you ever think of that possibility?&#x201D; asked Dragon Fifth.</p><p>&#x201C;Never. The relationship between two people can rarely be understood by a third party.&#x201D;</p><p>He couldn&#x2019;t help but glance once more at Qin Huhua. What exactly was the relationship between him and Dragon Fifth? Was there something more than met the eye?</p><p>He sighed. &#x201C;In any case, we will never know the answer to the mystery.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Why?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Because Justice of Hu also didn&#x2019;t leave the mourning hall alive.&#x201D;</p><p>Justice of Hu &#x201C;also&#x201D; was gone.</p><p>Did the word &#x201C;also&#x201D; contain another meaning? Were there other people who &#x201C;also&#x201D; died in the mourning hall?</p><p>Dragon Fifth didn&#x2019;t ask.</p><p>He didn&#x2019;t want to ask, and couldn&#x2019;t bear to ask.</p><p>&#x201C;In any case, the case is finally closed,&#x201D; he said. He extended the wine jug, which had just been replenished, and refilled Liu Changjie&#x2019;s cup.</p><p>Liu Changjie downed another. &#x201C;I never could have imagined that the case would be closed in this way.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;How did you think it would end? Did you really suspect me from the beginning?&#x201D;</p><p>Liu Changjie didn&#x2019;t answer his question. Instead, he said, &#x201C;You&#x2019;re fundamentally a very suspicious person.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Why?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Because down to this very moment, I can&#x2019;t see through you.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;And what about you? Who can see through you?&#x201D; Dragon Fifth laughed. &#x201C;I always thought it was strange. Why could Power of Hu and all his people not learn the truth about you?&#x201D;</p><p>Liu Changjie laughed. &#x201C;Because there&#x2019;s no truth to learn.&#x201D;</p><p>Dragon Fifth stared at him. One word at a time, he said, &#x201C;Can you finally tell me&#x2026; Who are you?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;You and Power of Hu both went to that little town,&#x201D; said Liu Changjie coolly. &#x201C;You both investigated me.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;And we both found out nothing.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Of course you didn&#x2019;t.&#x201D; He smiled. &#x201C;It&#x2019;s because I was born in that little town, and I lived a very normal life.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;And now?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Now I&#x2019;m just a local constable there.&#x201D;</p><p>A look of shock covered Dragon Fifth&#x2019;s face.</p><p>&#x201C;A person like you, just a local constable from a small town?&#x201D;</p><p>Liu Changjie nodded. &#x201C;You couldn&#x2019;t learn anything about my history because you never imagined that I really was just a small-town constable.&#x201D;</p><p>Dragon Fifth let out a long sigh, and then laughed bitterly. &#x201C;I definitely never imagined.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;You both only met me because my superiors ordered me to get involved with the case. Otherwise you would never have known that there was a person like me in the world.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Are you telling the truth?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;You don&#x2019;t believe me?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;I believe you. But there&#x2019;s still something I don&#x2019;t understand.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;What&#x2019;s that?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;A person like you, why would you choose to be a local constable?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;I&#x2019;ve always done whatever I feel like doing.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;You always wanted to be a constable?&#x201D;</p><p>Liu Changjie nodded.</p><p>Dragon Fifth laughed bitterly. &#x201C;Some people want to be famous heroes. Some people want to have a high position and a handsome salary. Some people seek fame and some people seek riches. I&#x2019;ve seen all these types of people before.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;But you&#x2019;ve never seen a person who wanted to be a constable?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;There are definitely not very many people like you.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;There are plenty of famous heroes in the world, so there should definitely be some people like me, people who are willing to do that which other&#x2019;s won&#x2019;t do, or aren&#x2019;t willing to do.&#x201D; He smiled, and this time it was a happy smile. &#x201C;In the end, there have to be constables. And if a person can do what they want to do in life, shouldn&#x2019;t they be happy?&#x201D;&#xA0;</p>
