<p>Chapter 191 - Lord of Ice (3)</p><p><span style="">Seoul Station.</span></p><p><span style="">Fortunately, this place hadn&#x2019;t been cleared by anyone yet, so Kahng-woojin was able appear at this location.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Huh. &#xA0;Is it fine to leave this place like this?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">After the Dungeon Shock, this region had gone through a lot of change, but now it had gone through another change.</span></p><p><span style="">The old Alandal guild offices were in ruins, and the training ground was razed to the ground. &#xA0;For the past five years, humans had experienced going through the Dungeon Breaks, so they had developed numerous techniques using heavy equipments to bring about rapid repairs. &#xA0;&#xA0;However, the area around the Seoul Station looked desolate.</span></p><p><span style="">If the monster attacks was still ongoing, it would have been understandable. &#xA0;However, he could see the roads being cleared, and heavy equipments fixing the other buildings. &#xA0;He could guess at what was happening.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;So they are saying they won&#x2019;t fix anything that aren&#x2019;t on their lands?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The region near the Seoul Station was the territory of Alandal.</span></p><p><span style="">This region was the only place where the recovery efforts weren&#x2019;t occurring.</span></p><p><span style="">Woojn walked towards the fallen buildings.</span></p><p><span style="">He headed towards where he could hear the sounds of human activities. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">He arrived at a clearing where an excavator was clearing away debris. &#xA0;In the middle of this clearing, a temporary tent was erected, and he saw a familiar face beneath this tent.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;He is leading a charmed life.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The world was going to hell, yet Woo-soonghoon was lazily sleeping beneath the tent as he listened to the radio.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x300C;Chee-jeek. &#xA0;This is our next story. &#xA0;It was sent in by grandmother Oh-misoon from Gyeongju&#x2026;.&#x300D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hey. &#xA0;Wake up.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Uh? Uh uh? P...pres&#x2026; &#xA0;No, my king.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">At Woojin&#x2019;s appearance, Woo-soonghoon turned his head, and he quickly scrambled to his feet in surprise. &#xA0;The workers, who had been working, looked to see what the fuss was about. &#xA0;When they saw Woojin&#x2019;s face, they came running towards him.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Why are you rebuilding this place?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What? &#xA0;Well, we have salvage whatever we can. &#xA0;Also, shouldn&#x2019;t we have a base camp near the Dungeon?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;It&#x2019;s all right. &#xA0;All of us are going back to the flying fortress, so I want you to gather everyone.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Excuse me? &#xA0;I have to stay behind here to work on our diplomatic relationship with the Korean government&#x2026;.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;From what I saw, you don&apos;t look like you have much to do here.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;No way. &#xA0;Just my mere presence here&#x2026;.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">When Soonghoon talked back to him, Woojin&#x2019;s eyebrows arched. &#xA0;Soonghoon quickly simplified his explanation, so Woojin could understand his intention.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;At the very least, shouldn&#x2019;t there be a hostage present here? &#xA0;It isn&#x2019;t as if Alandal has fully renounced Korea yet.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hostage? You are one?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;&#x2026;yes. &#xA0;At the very least, the king&#x2019;s chief secretary should stay behind. &#xA0;Well, I&#x2019;m the least useful one, so I should do this.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Woo-soonghoon wasn&#x2019;t a Roused.</span></p><p><span style="">If one excluded Jung-minchan and Kim-haemin, he was the next highest ranked officer amongst the founding members. &#xA0;However, what he brought to the table was miniscule compared to how high his position was at Alandal.</span></p><p><span style="">Since he always tried to find a role for himself, he did the miscellaneous works. &#xA0;No one ordered him to do so, yet he always volunteered himself for these tasks. &#xA0;It was admirable.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;It&#x2019;s all right. &#xA0;Go gather all of our luggages.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">He didn&#x2019;t care about leaving the diplomatic channels open or not. &#xA0;It&#x2019;ll be more convenient for him to gather everyone at the flying fortress. &#xA0;His mind would be at ease as he worked.</span></p><p><span style="">At his command, the remaining employees of Alandal present in the Seoul Station were all gathered. &#xA0;There were 25 of them, and none of them were Roused.</span></p><p><span style="">The regular employees were hired by Jung-minchan&#x2019;s discretion, and Woojin decided to &#xA0;take over the recruitment of Roused. &#xA0;However, he hadn&#x2019;t hired any new Roused, since he hired the members of the Phantom Unit.</span></p><p><span style="">There were other Roused employed on the flying fortress, but they weren&#x2019;t of the human race. &#xA0;To be precise, they were Dimensional refugees. &#xA0;They weren&#x2019;t from earth.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;So how are we going to get there?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;We are going to get there by&#x2026;.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin spoke as if it wasn&#x2019;t a problem, yet he let out a sigh when he looked at them. &#xA0;They weren&#x2019;t Roused, so they wouldn&#x2019;t be able to pass through the Portal. &#xA0;Woojin had no choice, but to use a physical method to transport them.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;We&#x2019;ll fly there.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What? &#xA0;Most of the flights were cancelled&#x2026;.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">When the number of flying monsters increased, it was too dangerous to fly in airplanes. &#xA0;This was why most airlines indefinitely suspended their flights.</span></p><p><span style="">Few companies dared to fly their airplanes, and there was no guarantee one of these airplanes were present at the Incheon Airport.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yong Yong.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">At Woojin&#x2019;s summon, a black smoke coalesced to form atop the fallen remains of a building.</span></p><p><span style="">[What is your wish?]</span></p><p><span style="">Accompanying a heart attack inducing sound, a large Bone Dragon was summoned.</span></p><p><span style="">It was like the fossils one could see in a museum. &#xA0;It was made out of bones, and there was no way it&#x2019;ll be able to fly.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I...It really can fly?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin smirked as he looked at Yong Yong, who was preening in an arrogant manner.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;There&#x2019;s always a way.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">When Woojin was approaching Yong Yong, it suddenly raised its head into the air.</span></p><p><span style="">[Koo-roo-roo.]</span></p><p><span style="">It was gazing into the sky. &#xA0;Everyone followed its gaze, but nothing was there. &#xA0;Unlike the world that had gone to hell, the sky was clear, and there was only a single cloud in the sky.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ho-oh?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin couldn&#x2019;t see it with his eyes, but he could clearly feel the energy. &#xA0;It was a grave situation.</span></p><p><span style="">[It&#x2019;s Ibrit.]</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Is that so?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">When Yong Yong confirmed it, Woojin&#x2019;s expression slightly hardened as if this development wasn&#x2019;t welcomed.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;A really troublesome bastard has arrived.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">He was the king of the Knife-beak Crows.</span></p><p><span style="">Undying Crow Ibrit.</span></p><p><span style="">Kee-ahhhhh!</span></p><p><span style="">Accompanying a screech, a large body appeared. &#xA0;It was covered with black feathers that rippled like water.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;As soon as I returned to earth, I come across the 70th throne&#x2026;..&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">He was an existence that was worshipped as a god in 70 Dimensions. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">When Ibrit appeared, he took out all his equipments from his Inventory, and he put it on.</span></p><p><span style="">Jeju&#x2019;s Manjang Cave.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;It is time.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">After a long wait, he had took on a tangible form on earth, and he was close to the time of his triumph. &#xA0;This was why his time hiding in the Manjang Cave felt slow. &#xA0;It felt like an eternity. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">The day when everything will culminate was here. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">Ddee-ring, ddee-ring.</span></p><p><span style="">After he earnestly looked at his handphone, Lee-sahngho gave his report.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;A black mysterious bird appeared above Seoul.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Bring it to me..&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The hand phone was handed over to Iello, and he smiled when he saw the picture.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;It is Ibrit.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Ibrit was of the 70th Throne, and it was a very troublesome opponent.</span></p><p><span style="">Amongst the great lords with Thrones, one wasn&#x2019;t ranked based on power or battle capability. &#xA0;The ranking measured, who had the better management skill. &#xA0;It was merely a number.</span></p><p><span style="">A strong opponent could have a low number, and a weak one could have a high number.</span></p><p><span style="">If one looked only at the pure battle capability, Ibrit was within the top five amongst the great lords.</span></p><p><span style="">Iello was the 25th Throne, but he was also one of the top great lords in terms of battle capability.</span></p><p><span style="">Iello exited the Manjang cave with a confident expression on his face.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I&#x2019;ll start hunting at my leisure.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Even amongst the planets, earth was a special.</span></p><p><span style="">Since the Synchronization was finished, several hundred lords will converge in an attempt to gain the Master code. </span></p><p><span style="">If he wanted to come out on top, he would need to make allies of the native people. &#xA0;He would used them as his allied army.</span></p><p><span style="">He&#x2019;ll defeat the villain, and he&#x2019;ll become the savior.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Enough. This will be adequate.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Ibrit was a being that was absolutely wedded to the role of a villain.</span></p><p><span style="">Would earth&#x2019;s existing military force be able to withstand the assault of this being?</span></p><p><span style="">Their best efforts would only be able to drain the health of Ibrit. &#xA0;When the time comes, he&#x2019;ll defeat Ibrit, and he&#x2019;ll become the hero of earth.</span></p><p><span style="">He&#x2019;ll present himself as a vassal of earth. &#xA0;Lee-sahngho had already finished the preparations under the table.</span></p><p><span style="">Kee-ahk!</span></p><p><span style="">Ibrit had not&#x2019; descended alone. &#xA0;A flock of several thousand crows appeared with him, and they swept across Seoul. &#xA0;The black birds occupied the sky, and they dove between the buildings to pluck out and eat the hearts of humans. &#xA0;They also caused explosions by attacking the vehicles and gas pipeline.</span></p><p><span style="">Puh-uhng! Kwahng!</span></p><p><span style="">Several crows were swept up by the explosions, but only few died.</span></p><p><span style="">The crows were like a black storm, and they nested at an islet located at the Hahn river.</span></p><p><span style="">Koo-ooh-oohng!</span></p><p><span style="">The Undying Crow&#x2019;s size rivalled a Dragon. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">Ibrit&#x2019;s landing broke apart the bridge that ran over the islet.</span></p><p><span style="">Koo-koo-koohng!</span></p><p><span style="">Ibrit made the island float above the river, and it immediately planted a Thorn Tree.</span></p><p><span style="">Ryuu-ahhhhhk!</span></p><p><span style="">An enormous tree kept growing as if it was trying to defy the sky . &#xA0;After the Synchronization ended, there were no restrictions placed on the Symbols.</span></p><p><span style="">The trunk of the tree kept getting thicker, and it was thick enough to occupy half the island. &#xA0;The branches were so long that they reached the banks of the Hahn river.</span></p><p><span style="">Ibrit landed atop the bizarre thorn tree, which held no leaves. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">It was impossible to think that this enormous tree belonged on earth, yet it had grown to full height in 10 minutes.</span></p><p><span style="">Kee-ahhhhh.</span></p><p><span style="">From the top of the tree, it could see the entirety of Seoul at a glance.</span></p><p><span style="">There were several hundred Dungeon entrances nearby.</span></p><p><span style="">It could tell by the energies that there were millions of people clustered together in various locations....</span></p><p><span style="">Ibrit let out a cry.</span></p><p><span style="">[I declare this place to be the territory of Ibrit-nim!]</span></p><p><span style="">His domineering words weren&#x2019;t spoken in any languages spoken on earth. &#xA0;The cry rang out as it moved to the far reaches of Seoul.</span></p><p><span style="">Only one person understood its words.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;You&#x2019;re talking shit.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin jumped off the Phantom Steed to land on top of the Thorn Tree. &#xA0;The thorns were the size of a full grown man, so there were a lot of places where he couldn&#x2019;t stand.</span></p><p><span style="">[Necromancer&#x2026;.]</span></p><p><span style="">Ibrit&#x2019;s red eyes blinked.</span></p><p><span style="">Its domineering gaze shot towards Woojin.</span></p><p><span style="">[Are you going to submit to me? Or do you want to be hunted down by me?]</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I&#x2019;ll choose the hunt.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">[I&#x2019;ll repay your bravery.]</span></p><p><span style="">Ibrit opened its wings wide. &#xA0;Its wings were enormous, and the feathers on its wings stood on end. &#xA0;The feathers became as sharp as knives. &#xA0;Even if one was brushed by its feathers, one would become cut into tatters.</span></p><p><span style="">Since it was such a threatening sight, Woojin sharpened his senses as the tension within him increased.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;This is exciting.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">This was his first time facing Ibrit. &#xA0;He just heard stories about Ibrit from Jaenis and Yong Yong. Now that he was in front of it, its overpowering nature was no joke.</span></p><p><span style="">He was fighting it for the first time, but Woojin was confident in himself.</span></p><p><span style="">He wasn&#x2019;t alone.</span></p><p><span style="">Shwahk, kwah-jeek!</span></p><p><span style="">Its speed was unbecoming of such a large body. &#xA0;Ibrit dashed forward at an incredible speed, and one wing was sweeping towards Woojin.</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin jumped to avoid the attack, and since he didn&#x2019;t have wings, he started falling to the ground. &#xA0;However, Phantom Steed Shing Shing appeared, and it stopped Woojin&#x2019;s fall.</span></p><p><span style="">Kee-ahhhhh!</span></p><p><span style="">The knife-like feathers were as sharp as Ibrit&#x2019;s screech, but Woojin&#x2019;s Soul Armor was able to block all the projectiles.</span></p><p><span style="">When it saw Woojin heading below the island, Ibrit rotated its body as if it was about to free fall towards the ground.</span></p><p><span style="">Shoo-shoo-shoo-shoohk!</span></p><p><span style="">The feathers were seeped with incredibly strong energy, and the feathers fell towards Woojin &#xA0;like rain. &#xA0;This time his Spirit Armor couldn&#x2019;t stop all of them.</span></p><p><span style="">Choo-choo-choot!</span></p><p><span style="">Several blades brushed by Woojin, and he suffered multiple wounds. &#xA0;His stored souls immediately absorbed into him to heal the damage.</span></p><p><span style="">It had been a long time, since he had faced an opponent of this caliber.</span></p><p><span style="">It was the first after he reached the pinnacle as a Necromancer.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Now.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">While he kept descending towards the ground, Jaenis and the Skeleton Magicians focused their magic on Ibrit. </span></p><p><span style="">Hwah-roo-roohk!</span></p><p><span style="">The Hell Fire charred the black feathers, but it couldn&#x2019;t be set on fire. &#xA0;Several Death Knights were also summoned. &#xA0;They appeared from very locations to latch themselves onto the body of Ibrit.</span></p><p><span style="">[Small fry.]</span></p><p><span style="">Ibrit shook its body, and it let out a loud screech.</span></p><p><span style="">Kee-ahhhhh!</span></p><p><span style="">The Fear&#x2019;s influence didn&#x2019;t take hold on the Undead, but this sound wasn&#x2019;t meant for them in the first place. </span></p><p><span style="">Kee-ahhhhk!</span></p><p><span style="">Several thousand Knife-beak Crows flew into the air. &#xA0;They blotted out one&#x2019;s vision as they attacked the Undead army.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;So you want to do this with me?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">He would never lose in terms of numbers. &#xA0;Woojin immediately summoned his Undead army on the Island. &#xA0;The Skeleton Warriors and the black crows fought each other, and it created a chaotic scene.</span></p><p><span style="">Moreover, when Ibrit was nearly to the floor, the enormous Bone Dragon pounced. &#xA0;It opened its jaw, and it bit Ibrit&#x2019;s neck.</span></p><p><span style="">Kooooohng!</span></p><p><span style="">The two enormous beings rolled across the ground, and as the trees nearby was uprooted, the rim of island started to sink into the ground. &#xA0;When Yong Yong refused to let go of Ibrit&#x2019;s neck, Wooojin yelled out to him.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;All right. &#xA0;Just keep hit immobilized like that.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">[Goo-oh-oh-oh!]</span></p><p><span style="">Ibrit&#x2019;s head was being held to the ground. &#xA0;A being that looked like a Steel Puppet ran across a broken branch of a Thorn Tree. &#xA0;&#xA0;After he jumped high into the sky, he brought his fist down on the crown of Ibrit&#x2019;s head.</span></p><p><span style="">Ggoo-ahhhng!</span></p><p><span style="">The shockwave was big enough to cause waves on the Hahn river. &#xA0;However, the blow wasn&#x2019;t strong enough to chase Ibrit back to its Dimension.</span></p><p><span style="">[How dare you!]</span></p><p><span style="">The crow used powerful strokes of its wings to shoot into the air.</span></p><p><span style="">Koo-ahng, koohng!</span></p><p><span style="">The Crow and the Dragon impacted on various parts of the Thorn Tree as they flew into the air, and Yong Yong was eventually dislodged. &#xA0;Yong Yong fell to the ground..</span></p><p><span style="">Kee-ahhhhhhh!</span></p><p><span style="">Ibrit flew at a higher elevation than the Thorn Tree and it let out a cry.</span></p><p><span style="">Amongst the continuously resetting Dungeons, several subway stations reacted to the cry.</span></p>
