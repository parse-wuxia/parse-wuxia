<p><strong>Chapter 81 Return.</strong></p><div id="chapterContent" class="innerContent fr-view"><p><span style="">Chapter 81 - Return</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p><p><span style="">Titan Guild&apos;s Private Plane.</span></p><p><span style="">When he saw the grandly prepared in-flight meal, Woojin spoke.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;This one is better than Jongdo-hyung&apos;s plane.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Minchan tilted his head in confusion.</span></p><p><span style="">Jongdo? Ah&#x2026; President Baek-jongdo.</span></p><p><span style="">Minchan suddenly felt awkward in the current situation.</span></p><p><span style="">When they traveled to the US, they had used the KH Guild&apos;s private plane. And when they had to return to Korea, the Titan Guild let them borrow their private plane.</span></p><p><span style="">They had participated in the consortium, but they had received special treatments. They also made a separate treaty with the Titan Guild.</span></p><p><span style="">Their guild were on equal footing&#x2026; No, Alandal was in the dominant position against America&apos;s top guild.</span></p><p><span style="">Everything arose with Woojin at the root of it all.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;When I finally think I know you, I find out that I really didn&#x2019;t.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin dipped a piece of bread into honey, and ate it in one bite.</span></p><p><span style="">Even his action right now was incredible to Minchan.</span></p><p><span style="">Minchan thought about it, never having witnessed such luxuries. They were given the the use of chartered airplanes, the best hotels, translators&#x2026;</span></p><p><span style="">Even after given all these luxuries, Woojin took it in stride, in a cool manner. It would be strange not to look at him as if he were amazing.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;President. I honestly feel that you are a really amazing person. It still feel like I&apos;m in a fleeting dream.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">He used to be a team leader in the Hammer Guild, yet he had just negotiated with the the Titan Guild&apos;s most important figures on equal footing. They were the number one guild in the US.</span></p><p><span style="">Just this fact boosted Minchan&apos;s self-confidence.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What nonsense are you spouting now.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin had lived in much more luxury and public interest in the past. He was apathetic to such things. Truthfully, this kind of thing didn&apos;t matter much to Woojin. He had thrown away that lifestyle, one an emperor would have envied, to come back to earth.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Haha. I think I&apos;m slowly getting used to it.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Jung-minchan let out an embarrassed laugh.</span></p><p><span style="">He joined when he saw Woojin and Alandal&apos;s growth potential. However he had made a wrong assessment. Alandal was like a high speed train that was already in motion. He had been lucky. He had gotten on the train before it had started to move.</span></p><p><span style="">Alandal&apos;s growth was so fast that their guild moved past the boundaries of Korea. Now they were establishing their name across the world. Even if he was the general director, he would be left behind on the curbside if he wasn&apos;t on his game.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes. You have to get used to everything&#x2026;. Bibi.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes? What the heck is a Bibi?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Black smoke coalesced on the table in front of Woojin, and a cat suddenly popped into existence.</span></p><p><span style="">Bibi looked at Minchan, then she tilted her head in confusion in a very cute manner.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Nyahh.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;You don&apos;t have to pretend to be a cat anymore.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ha-ah. Understood-ahong.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Minchan stood up from his seat in fright as human words suddenly came out of the cat&apos;s mouth.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;W...what the hell is th...this cat?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Why are you so surprised? This is a world where monsters pop out of Dungeons.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">When he put it that way, it did make sense.</span></p><p><span style="">Minchan sat in his chair again.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;She is my familiar.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I&apos;m Bibi-ahong.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I&apos;m Jung-minchan..&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Minchan felt endlessly awkward exchanging a conversation with a cat. Bibi turned her head towards Woojin.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Why did you call me-ahong?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I wanted you to eat some food.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I have no appetite-ahong&#x2026;.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;&#x2026;.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Bibi had been revived from death not too long ago. Woojin knew Bibi liked sampling earth&apos;s food, so he had purposefully summoned her...</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Just call me later when you are going to sleep-ahong.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Uh. All right.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Bibi disappeared as she turned into black smoke. As if his appetite had been chased away, he put down the bread he had been eating.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Did something happen?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Minchan didn&apos;t know the details, but he was quick to pick up on Woojin&apos;s mood. It made Minchan turn serious right alongside Woojin.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;It&apos;s nothing. I&apos;m going to sleep, so don&apos;t wake me up.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes&#x2026; Please rest.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin had cleared Dungeons for the past month without taking a single break. In real time, he had spent thirty days inside of the Dungeon, but what it felt like to Woojin was actually 120 days. It would be strange if he wasn&apos;t tired.</span></p><p><span style="">Minchan&apos;s heart became heavy as he saw Woojin walk into the bedroom.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;President must be tired.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">He suddenly thought about all the things he took for granted with Woojin and reflected upon his thoughts. Woojin was still human, so of course he would be under a lot of stress.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;It&#x2019;s the Support Division&apos;s job to properly assist him.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">Aiding the Roused; it was the main reason why guilds existed.</span></p><p><span style="">Even if everyone talked about guarding the world, it was Minchan&apos;s job to support Woojin in the end. Saving the world felt too far away, so he had decided to pay attention to Woojin, who was nearby. Minchan&apos;s job was to help Woojin.</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin was under much more strain than Minchan could imagine.</span></p><p><span style="">It was so bad that he had preferred hunting down monster in a pressured situation rather than going to sleep. He had held out until he reached the limit of his willpower, but he eventually had to sleep.</span></p><p><span style="">While Woojin&apos;s consciousness weakened, the evil spirits showed up to torment Woojin, but he couldn&apos;t do anything.</span></p><p><span style="">Bibi had still been dead&#x2026;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin laid down on a fancy bed one could find in a hotel room. Bibi curled up by his pillow. When he saw Bibi in low spirits, his anger towards Rashmode spiked.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I&apos;ll never leave you behind when I go hunting from now on..&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;Understood-ahong.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">If only Bibi had been stronger&#x2026; She might have been able to escape through her own power. With the purpose of protecting his family, he had left Bibi home too much.</span></p><p><span style="">Leveling up his familiars was as important as getting stronger to Woojin.</span></p><p><span style="">The Immortal&apos;s true power wasn&apos;t the power he wielded. It was his Undead Army, which was composed of his familiars.</span></p><p><span style="">It had been a really long time since Woojin fell deep into sleep.</span></p><p><span style="">He didn&apos;t have a sweet dream, but he didn&apos;t mind being accosted by nightmares.</span></p><p><span style="">The airplane with Woojin in it headed towards Korea.</span></p><p><span style="">*</span></p><p><span style="">The manager took out the bag from the compartment above the seat and looked at the singer sitting on the seat.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hey, Cindy. Let&apos;s get off.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Oppa. Let&apos;s wait a little bit longer before we go.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Huh? Aren&apos;t you tired?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Cindy&apos;s manager, Moon-sahngchul, was worried as he saw her tired face. However, what could he do? One had to row when the tide came in. If they didn&apos;t take advantage of the current situation, they would never know when Cindy could still become popular as she was right now.</span></p><p><span style="">Her schedule was so tight that he hadn&apos;t been able to make the flight appointment until it was too late. He couldn&apos;t book a first class seat, so he felt sorry towards her.</span></p><p><span style="">A woman sitting in a seat from across the aisle walked towards Cindy.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Unni! Here are the items you are sponsoring.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Cindy put on the shoes and sunglasses and was pushed towards by the stylist. Then, she picked up her bag.</span></p><p><span style="">The arrival of a star at an airport was a newsworthy event. The reporters took pictures of the outfit dubbed Airport Fashion. It was a fantastic way to advertise products.</span></p><p><span style="">From the tip of her toes to her head, sponsored items were worn by a popular entertainer like Cindy.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;If you&apos;re ready, let&apos;s go.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Whew. Let&apos;s head out.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Cindy let out a short sigh as she trudged forward. It was uncomfortable to wear all these items, but she had been able to sleep a lot on the plane. She was in a pretty good condition.</span></p><p><span style="">After putting on a cheerful smile, she passed through the arrival gate.</span></p><p><span style="">Cindy, who had a bright smile on her face, couldn&apos;t help but be taken aback at the numerous reporters and broadcast cameras.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;A...aren&apos;t there too many of them?&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">It wasn&apos;t only Cindy who had been taken aback. Her stylist, as well as her mananger Moon-sahngchul, had also stopped walking from the surprise.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Oppa. What are you doing?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Oh yeah.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Cindy was the first one to gather herself. Sahngchul also regained his senses as he looked around Cindy&apos;s surrounding. She started walking with a bright smile on her face. It was a familiar yet unfamiliar situation, so she felt really awkward in this situation.</span></p><p><span style="">None of the several dozens of cameras let out a flash.</span></p><p><span style="">As she continued to walk, her patented smile slowly disappeared from her face. She quietly asked her manager.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Oppa. Is someone else arriving here today?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I have no idea. It does seem someone is coming...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">He couldn&apos;t say &apos;someone who is more famous than you is coming...&apos;, since it might hurt Cindy&apos;s pride.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Isn&apos;t that Cindy over there?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I guess so. Just take several shots.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Eh. I guess we can somewhat salvage this situation with some pictures of her.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">What the hell? This felt worse than receiving no interest at all.</span></p><p><span style="">Cindy tried to hear the conversation between the reporters, who were still not showing any interest in her. Now that she had looked them over they weren&apos;t the usual reporters from the entertainment division she usually saw.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;When is Mr. Kahng-woojin arriving?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;He&apos;s on a private plane, so we don&apos;t know the exact details.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ha. Maybe he was already diverted to a different route?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Eh-ee. He has to pass through here no matter what.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;You never know. Cheongwadae might have sent him an escort...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">At his words, all the waiting reporters turned to glare sharply at the reporter. If his words were true, then they had waited five hours for nothing.</span></p><p><span style="">Unexpectedly, Cindy was able to exit the airport without any fuss. When Cindy got in the company van, she immediately took off the sunglasses.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Huh. Jeez. It seems Kahg-woojin is quite an amazing person.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Uh-ooh. He&apos;s incredibly hot right now. It seems he&#x2019;s coming back from the US today. Hey, Hweesup. Let&apos;s go.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes, chief.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The company&apos;s road manager put the van in motion. Moon-sahngchul opened his hand phone. He didn&apos;t even need to search for Kahng-woojin. His name was trending as the most real time searched word.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Every time he does something, he is always the number one searched person.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">It pretty much indicated how explosive the interest that Kahng-woojin was currently receiving from the public was. He could now understand why several dozen reporters were looking for Kahng-woojin.</span></p><p><span style="">His every movement was considered to be a scoop in Korea.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ah. It seems he&apos;ll be meeting the President today. Those reporters have to completely write-off today.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">It meant Kahng-woojin had escaped the airport already in secret. In the real time search ranking, keywords such as &apos;Kahng-woojin meeting the President&apos;, &apos;Kahng-woojin and Cheongwae&apos; was starting to pop up.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hey, Cindy.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Uh?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What are you looking at? Are you also looking for the articles?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;It...it&apos;s nothing.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">When Cindy turned on her private handphone, she had read the message that had been sent to her.</span></p><p><span style="">[Notice for Mido High school&apos;s Alumni meeting. &#x3147;&#x3147;Restaurant 7 o&apos;clock. Kahng-woojin in attendance. &#x2026; This is the end to this week&apos;s mail. Please reply if attending. Chairman Nahm-jihyuhk.]</span></p><p><span style="">After she first debuted, she had gone to the alumni meeting several times.</span></p><p><span style="">After she became busy, however, she had never gone to one. It seemed that she needed to go this time.</span></p><p><span style="">Cindy turned over her hazy memories. There was this one student who had disappeared before the Dungeon Shock. It had caused a big ruckus.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;This Kahng-woojin is that guy?&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">It had been a long time since Cindy&apos;s eyes shone with interest. Her finger immediately pressed reply on her handphone.</span></p><p><span style="">*</span></p><p><span style="">Inside the limousine sent by Cheongwadae&#x2019;s secretariat. (TLN:Cheongwadae is also called the Blue House. Korean equivalent of the White House.)</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Let me off here.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">His days were filled with a lot of surprises, but a situation like this had always surprised him in a new way.</span></p><p><span style="">Michan couldn&apos;t help but dumbly ask the question. Maybe he misheard?</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Let me off right over there. I&apos;m riding a taxi back.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What are you going to do about the P..Ppresident and the dinner party?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I don&apos;t care about the dinner party. I&apos;m full.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">No, a dinner party didn&#x2019;t really mean it was solely for eating food.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Still, the President invited us...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I even skipped out on the Yankee President, so why should I care about this?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Still, this is the second time...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;You can go in my place.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Minchan let out a deep sigh.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;President has to go. Even if a general director attends&#x2026;.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Just remake your business card.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;You are vice-president from now on.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;&#x2026;.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Just tell them you are there instead of the president.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;&#x2026;.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Minchan pinched the bridge of his nose.</span></p><p><span style="">Ha. He was in a tough position, yet he couldn&apos;t help but feel giddy.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Just tell them I went home since I&apos;m tired. You talk to them.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Still, this is...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Vice-president Jung-minchan. Fighting!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;&#x2026;.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Ha, vice-president. Vice-president&#x2026;.</span></p><p><span style="">His eyes were troubled, but his lips kept stretching into a smile.</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin grinned, then he spoke to the driver in a clean suit.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Please stop here.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;But the President....&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Are you trying to take me somewhere when I don&apos;t want to go?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;But&#x2026;.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Are you trying to kidnap me? Will you be able to bear the fallout?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The driver was taken aback by Woojin&apos;s word, and he didn&apos;t know what to do. Minchan spoke to the driver in a reasonable manner.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Please stop. Our president&apos;s condition isn&apos;t so good.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;&#x2026;.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">He didn&apos;t look like that at all, but&#x2026; he was only the driver so he had no choice. He stopped his car by the road.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I&apos;ll see you later president. When I go to the office later, I&apos;ll give you my business report after I organize it properly.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">They had made an alliance with the Titan guild, and there were the small deals they had made after finishing tasks given by the US government. There were a lot of things he had to report.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;All right. Go have a good meal, vice-president Jung.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Ah, one doesn&apos;t go to dinner party just to eat. When Woojin spoke like that, it seemed as if he were saying that Minchan was going to a birthday party just to eat food.</span></p><p><span style="">Minchan gave his farewell to Woojin and rolled the window up.</span></p><p><span style="">He sneakily moved to the seat of honor where Woojin had been sitting.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Huh huh, vice-president. Huh.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Minchan kept shaking his head as he put his hands over his forehead. His half covered face was filled with a smile.</span></p><p><span style="">He was probably the first one?</span></p><p><span style="">He had risen from being a salaryman in a guild&apos;s Support Division to the position of vice president.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ha, vice-president... Huh huh.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The driver kept glancing at his mirror as if Minchan was acting strange.</span></p><p><span style="">Both this guild&apos;s president and vice-president were all abnormal people.</span></p><p><span style="">The limousine slowly headed towards the Cheongwadae.</span></p><p></p></div><p></p>
