</span></p><p><span style="">The sudden sword fight had everyone in the surrounding retreating backwards.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;He&apos;s really trying to kill me.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">Kim-kahngchul felt the threat to his own life.</span></p><p><span style="">Kahng-woojin&apos;s eyes twinkled.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;He&apos;s pretty decent.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">Ten seconds. </span></p><p><span style="">Woojin&apos;s sword strikes changed.</span></p><p><span style="">Shoo-shoohk, chahk! </span></p><p><span style="">Woojin&apos;s movements was much faster. &#xA0;Kim-kahngchul was moving his hands and feet in a dizzying manner, but blood was starting to erupt from various parts of his body. &#xA0;However, these were very superficial cuts on his skin. </span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Is he taking it easy on me?&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">When that thought entered his mind, he allowed a significant attack to slip through his defense.</span></p><p><span style="">Poo-oohk! </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Shit!&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">The sword had pierced through his shoulder, and Kim-kahngchul stabbed back with his dagger with ill intent. &#xA0;If he had known he was going to fight, he would have brought his main weapon. &#xA0;He regretted not bring it.</span></p><p><span style="">The dagger swung by him couldn&apos;t even graze against Woojin&apos;s clothes.</span></p><p><span style="">Kwah-dahng! </span></p><p><span style="">At Woojin&apos;s kick, Kim-kahngchul fell over. &#xA0;Before he could right himself, a low kick flew in to knock him down once again.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ooh-oohk!&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">The unfortunate part was that a sword had come flying in instead of a kick on the following attack.</span></p><p><span style="">Suh-kuhk! </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Koo-ah-ah-ahk!&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Kim-khangchul&apos;s leg was cut by Woojin&apos;s sword. </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;This...this is insane.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I&apos;m leaving.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">There was unrest amongst the spectators, and they were moving away as if they were running away. &#xA0;The scene was a pandemonium. &#xA0;Woo-soonghoon became mute, and Jung-minchan put his hand on his forehead.</span></p><p><span style="">The president had made another accident again.</span></p><p><span style="">Kim-kahngchul was&#x2026;&#x2026;. </span></p><p><span style="">Poo-oohk! </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Koo-uhk!&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">The sword didn&apos;t stop.</span></p><p><span style="">He cut the tendons in Kim-kahngchul&apos;s sword arm, and Woojin planted his sword on the opposite shoulder. &#xA0;The blade went through the shoulder, and it imbedded itself in the ground.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ooh ooh ooh ooh.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">As the blood was leaking out all over the floor, Woojin crouched in front of Kim-kahngchul.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Thirty second has passed.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;C...crazy bastard.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Woojin grinned at Kim-kahngchul&apos;s words.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;It is a waste to kill you like this, so you pass the interview!&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Kim-kahngchul displayed hostility at Woojin&apos;s bright words.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hoong! &#xA0;Just kill me.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes, I will.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;&#x2026;.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">In the end, it didn&apos;t matter if he was alive or not. &#xA0;Some people were more easy to deal with in their death....</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin gripped the sword that was embedded in Kim-kahngchul&#x2019;s shoulder. The sword had been placed in an excellent location. &#xA0;If he used a little bit more force, he would be able to separate the head from the body. </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;W...wait a moment!&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What? &#xA0;Keep your last words short.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;P...please spare me.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Huh.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Hadn&apos;t he been the number 1 Roused in Korea? &#xA0;Did he have no backbone?</span></p><p><span style="">As if he had read the intent in Woojin&apos;s eyes, Kim-kahngchul spoke quickly.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I&apos;ll join your guild.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes. &#xA0;You will join in your death.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I...I want live and join.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;You do?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Please.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Kim-kahngchul felt a sense of urgency. </span></p><p><span style="">Woojin frowned as if what he heard was disagreeable.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Wouldn&#x2019;t it be more convenient to use a bastard like you in your death?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;You can&apos;t. &#xA0;I have something I have to do to save the earth.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Huh. &#xA0;Jeez. &#xA0;Are you trying to feed me a lie?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">When Woojin gripped his sword again, Kim-kahngchul revealed his final card. </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I&apos;m here to give you a message from Dr. Toppler. &#xA0;&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Where is that son of a bitch?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Woojin&apos;s reacted as if he was infuriated. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">Kim-kahngchul realized he had been too careless in coming here. &#xA0;He regretted his lack of preparation.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;He said I just needed to deliver a message.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">Anyways, the situation had turned for the worst. &#xA0;It seemed Kahng-woojin didn&apos;t have any good feelings towards Dr. Toppler. &#xA0;No matter how he looked at it, Kim-kahngchul was in a bad spot.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Let&apos;s go in....&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">There were still too many eyes in their surrounding. &#xA0;Woojin pulled out the sword stuck in Kim-kahngchul&apos;s shoulder in an annoyed fashion. </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Koo-oohp.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Woojin unsummoned his sword, and he looked around his surrounding. &#xA0;It seemed most people had run away, and only several dozen people remained. &#xA0;They were hanging around with fear in their gazes.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;You guys over there.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;A...are you talking to us?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">When Woojin&apos;s attention fell on them, the remaining people spoke out with trembling voices.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes. You guys all pass. &#xA0;Come in.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Woojin turned around, and he headed towards the front gate. &#xA0;Al Assad had been watching from the side. &#xA0;Al Assad picked up Kim-kahngchul by his mangled leg, and it slung him over its back. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Koo-uh-uhk!&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">The bones in his leg was twisted in an unseemly fashion, yet Al Assad didn&apos;t pay any attention to it. &#xA0;It just followed after Woojin.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Please be a little bit more gentle with me!&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">[Be thankful you still have your flesh and blood.] </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;&#x2026;.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Al Assad&apos;s terrifying nature was briefly revealed, and Kim-kahngchul shut his mouth. &#xA0;He had been famous for being Korea&apos;s number 1 Roused, but he didn&apos;t get any special treatments in Alandal. </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;S...should we head in?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Should we run away?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">They were the leftover Roused, who had come here for the interview. &#xA0;They gulped as they saw the trail of blood. &#xA0;The chosen Roused were standing on other side of the front gate, and their faces were white from fear.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I would like all the successful applicants to gather here.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Woo-soonghoon quickly organized everyone, and he quickly gathered the conflicted applicants. &#xA0;The security guards and the employees quickly cleared away the mess in front of the gate. &#xA0;Aside from Kim-kahngchul, Alandal had just finalized in hiring 23 new Roused employees.</span></p><p><span style="">*** </span></p><p><span style="">The president&apos;s room had turned into the king&#x2019;s office. &#xA0;The owner of Alandal was having a private audience with a sickly patient that needed to be sent to the emergency room immediately.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I&apos;m busy. &#xA0;Hurry up and tell me.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;can you heal me?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Why should I?
