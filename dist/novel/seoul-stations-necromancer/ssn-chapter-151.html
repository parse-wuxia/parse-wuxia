<p><span style="">Chapter 151 - Planet Jaku (3)</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin&apos;s eyebrows arched when he saw the group approaching him.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What the hell?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">It was a group of wary Elves.</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin chewed on his meat as he stood up.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Jaenis.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Shoo-ro-ro-rohk. </span></p><p><span style="">Accompanying a black smoke, Jaenis appeared, and it stood in front of Woojin.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Take care of them and follow me with Sunggoo.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">His stomach was full. &#xA0;It was time to start his hunt again.</span></p><p><span style="">[I follow the lord&apos;s wishes.] </span></p><p><span style="">Hwah-roo-roohk. </span></p><p><span style="">A black flame surged forth from the Lich&apos;s Staff.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I&apos;ll see you later, Sunggoo..&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ooh-juhk, ooh. &#xA0;Yes, uhng-nim.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Sunggoo seemed to have burned a lot of calories through his intense movements. &#xA0;He was quickly stuffing himself with food. &#xA0;When Woojin started to move, the Elves rushed forward to get on their knees.</span></p><p><span style="">They did it right before Jaenis&apos; flames exploded. &#xA0;The timing was exquisite.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What the hell?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">The handsome silver-haired Elf was on his knees as he spoke.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;We had heard a noble personage had visited our planet. I would be honored if you would give me an audience.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;&#x2026;.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Woojin stopped walking.</span></p><p><span style="">It had been awhile since he met the Elves. It had also been a long time since he heard the Elves try to butter him up while speaking nonsense.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Let&apos;s see. &#xA0;That won&apos;t be too difficult. &#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I am moved to tears by your assent.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">The silver haired Elf stood up as he kept his head slightly lowered, and he looked at Woojin as he spoke. A smile formed on Woojin&apos;s face.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;That&apos;s all you wanted, right?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes. &#xA0;I want to introduce myself to such an esteemed being...&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Nope.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">When Woojin cut him off, the Elf lowered his head again. Did something he said incur the other&apos;s displeasure? &#xA0;The Elf was in the process of replaying his previous action and words.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;If you are finished with your business, you should die.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Woojjin started to walk away again, and fire erupted from the Lich&apos;s staff.</span></p><p><span style="">Hwah-roo-roohk! </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Koo-ah-ah-ahk!&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Red light flickered in the eye sockets of the skull. &#xA0;It gave off the impression that it was laughing.</span></p><p><span style="">[The scream of Elves are always heartwarming.] </span></p><p><span style="">Three Elves were put on fire, and they started rolling on the ground. &#xA0;They tried to use Water magic, but the Hellfire was too hard to extinguish.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I...I serve the leader of the Red Hammer coalition named Morpo-nim...&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Puhhng! </span></p><p><span style="">The Elf spoke with a shaky voice when his head exploded. &#xA0;Fire exploded forth from where his head used to be. Sparks flew from Jaenis&#x2019; staff as if a current was running through it. The Lich&apos;s red eyes headed towards Sunggoo.</span></p><p><span style="">[There is no ingredient that burns as well as fear.] </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Huh?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">It was burning what? &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">Sunggoo quickly chewed and swallowed the meat inside his mouth. The Lich continued his speech.</span></p><p><span style="">[You have to make the enemies shake in fear. Then the stage will be yours.Goo-ha-ha.] </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;&#x2026;.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Even though Sunggoo had swallowed his food, he was having a hard time answering back.</span></p><p><span style="">There were two Elves still alive.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Do you realize what you just did right now? You attacked all three coalitions, who has Colonies on Planet Jaku!&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Woojin stopped walking when he heard the Elf&apos;s rage filled voice.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;So what?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Let us see how long your insane overconfidence lasts!&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;You won&apos;t be there to see it.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;&#x2026;.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Since you will be dying right now.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Gwah-ah-ah-ahng </span></p><p><span style="">[Goo-haha. It is time for us to redeem the Planet Jaku.] </span></p><p><span style="">A light emanated from the Lich and the Skeleton Magicians under its command was all summoned.</span></p><p><span style="">Kiehhhhhhhh. </span></p><p><span style="">The Skeleton Mages let out a bizarre laugh as they appeared. &#xA0;They were all fire type monsters. They all possessed slightly different magical energy. &#xA0;The Skeleton Mages gathered their two hand to form a fireball, and every single fireball was sent towards Sunggoo.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;&#x2026;!&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">What the hell? &#xA0;Why?</span></p><p><span style="">Jaenis said he wanted to redeem Jaku, yet why was the Lich attacking him?</span></p><p><span style="">Kwah-kwah-kwahng. </span></p><p><span style="">Woojin started walking again when the training session restarted.</span></p><p><span style="">It didn&apos;t matter if it was the Yellow Lizards, Black Hats or the Red Hammer. He&apos;ll destroy them all, and he will take everything from them. He&apos;ll use them as a stepping stone to get rid of every single Dimensional lord of Trahnet.</span></p><p><span style="">*** </span></p><p><span style="">Raksha ran for a full day with the help of her Wind Sprite.</span></p><p><span style="">When she saw a large tower over the horizon, she increased her speed.</span></p><p><span style="">It was the symbolic representation of her town. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">All of the ancient pillars used for their prayer rituals had been stolen from the Ratick tribe. &#xA0;This was a tower they had to build artificially.</span></p><p><span style="">There were houses made out of wide stones, wood and clay clustered near the tower. &#xA0;When she entered the forest that led to the town, &#xA0;the Warriors of the Ratick tribe suddenly appeared in front o f her.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Raksha!&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ribito.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;How did it go?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I have to go see the Shamaness.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">When Ribito saw Raksha&apos;s urgent expression, he opened up a path for her.</span></p><p><span style="">Raksha ran down the forest path. &#xA0;When she arrived at the tower&apos;s innermost chamber, an old woman of the Ratick tribe greeted her.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Raksha.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Shamaness Cheu-cheusha!&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What have you seen? &#xA0;Why are you so startled? &#xA0;Please calm down a little bit.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Raksha felt her heart calm down a little bit just from seeing Cheu-cheusha. She felt her worries and anxiety lessen. &#xA0;However, the sense of crisis didn&apos;t lessen at all.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Liah&apos;s Fortress has fallen.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;The calm lasted for quite awhile. I guess the war is starting up again.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">The enmity between the Coalitions resulted in them biting at each other. The infighting between these powers had created a small crack. &#xA0;It wasn&apos;t proper to say they survived, because of it. It was more apt to say the Ratick tribe had been forgotten from their interests.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;No. It wasn&apos;t the Coalitions. &#xA0;It was the new Predator, who defeated Relick.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Huh? He did?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">They were existences that were close to being gods.</span></p><p><span style="">As they erected Dungeons and Colonies, they were able to perform godlike miracles.</span></p><p><span style="">It had been a long time since a new Predator that wasn&apos;t affiliated with the three Coalitions had appeared.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;If it&apos;s Liah, isn&apos;t she part of the Black Hats?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes. &#xA0;The problem is he also offended Morpo-nim.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Even the Red Hammer&#x2026;.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Shamaness Cheu-cheusha had an expression full of worry as she shook her head from side to side.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;From the information I received from our scouts, this new Predator had friction with the Yellow Lizard Coalition....&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">This new Predator had just ticked off the three Coalitions on Planet Jaku. &#xA0;It basically meant he had declared war against every Predator on Planet Jaku.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;He&#x2019;ll be erased soon.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Raksha shook her head at Cheu-cheusha&apos;s words.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;He&apos;s the one, who defeated Relick! He might be the one from the legend, Shamaness.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Relick, who was the best warrior from the Ratick tribe, had died by his hands. Raksha had barely escaped from his grasp, so the sight of what happened was very vivid in her mind. &#xA0;She had seen overwhelming strength and spirit.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Which legend are you talking about?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;The legend where it says a Predator that eats other Predators will save the planet!&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Raksha was shaking from excitement. &#xA0;Cheu-cheusha looked at her with pity as she hugged Raksha tight.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;You poor thing.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What&apos;s wrong?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;That legend is false.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Cheu-cheusha stroked the head of the Ratick tribe&apos;s young sorceress.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;That version of the legend was made up to give people hope.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Do you want to know hear the real legend that had been handed down to us?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;&#x2026;.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;When a predator that eats other predator appears, the planet will draw near to its demise.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;&#x2026;!&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">It was demise instead of salvation! </span></p><p><span style="">Raksha shook her head vigorously from disbelief.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Let us pray he isn&apos;t the legendary Predator.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">If not, they will be the last generation of their race, and they will come to an end with their planet.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hoo-hoohk. &#xA0;What do we do?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">There was no hope.</span></p><p><span style="">The planet&apos;s future only held despair. &#xA0;Raksha cried.</span></p><p><span style="">She didn&apos;t have the presence of mind to notice her smiling shadow.</span></p><p><span style="">*** </span></p><p><span style="">It had been two days since she had locked herself inside her house. &#xA0;In front of Raksha&apos;s gaunt figure, Cheu-cheusha spoke with a worried expression. &#xA0;Cheu-cheusha was basically like her mother.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Please have a drink, Raksha.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;I&apos;m fine.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Cheu-cheusha looked on as Raksha put on weak smile, and she was regretting telling her the truth. &#xA0;She knew this child was strong, so she had expected her to overcome this news.</span></p><p><span style="">Maybe she should have let Raksha keep her false hope inside her heart.</span></p><p><span style="">Raksha was slowly dying, and it was starting from her heart.</span></p><p><span style="">Goo-roo-roo-roong.</span></p><p><span style="">At that moment, a vibration made the windows rattle.</span></p><p><span style="">Cheu-cheusha and Raksha looked at each other in surprise. &#xA0;A loud bell started to go off, and the noise assaulted their ears. &#xA0;It was a signal that notified the others about intruders.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I have to go out.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">When Cheu-cheusha exited the house, the town was in a disarray. &#xA0;Black smoke was rising up into the air from across the forest, and the town was busy getting ready to evacuate the children.</span></p><p><span style="">Cheu-cheusha grabbed a person running by her.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What is going on?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ah, Shamaness. There is an enormous Undead army marching on us from across the forest.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ha-ah. This is unexpected.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">The Predators gathered into groups to form Coalition, and they had always been busy fighting each other. &#xA0;They didn&apos;t show any interest to the very small number of the Ratick tribe that was still alive. An army hadn&apos;t been sent against them for the past 10 years.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What did he say?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Raksha exited her house, and she spoke with worry in her voice.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;It seems there are intruders. You should evacuate with the others.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;No. &#xA0;I will help the Warriors.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">There was life within Raksha&apos;s eyes. &#xA0;However, that life would be put on the line to fulfill her role as the sorceress. &#xA0;Cheu-cheusha&apos;s heart ached, since this might be Raksha&apos;s last act.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;You go do that.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes, mother. &#xA0;Thank you for everything.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Raksha gave a sincere farewell to Cheu-cheusha. &#xA0;Cheu-cheusha had raised her, and she had taught her sorcery. Cheu-cheusha had basically been a mother to her.</span></p><p><span style="">When Raksha arrived, the forest fire was already too big to stop. &#xA0;The Warriors of the Ratick race, who had hidden themselves in the forest, quickly ran away to form in front of the town.</span></p><p><span style="">This was their last ditch effort to buy time. &#xA0;This was the last battle to buy enough time for their children to run away.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Raksha!&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Who are they, Ribito?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;It is an army of a Predator, who I&apos;ve never seen nearby. &#xA0;They are Skeletons.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Skeletons&#x2026;.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">She was sure it was the man, who defeated Relick.</span></p><p><span style="">He had already advanced to this place.&#x2026; </span></p><p><span style="">What happened to the other Predator&apos;s Pillars and cities that should have occupied him along the way?</span></p><p><span style="">Kee-kee-kee-keek! </span></p><p><span style="">Soon, the uniquely unpleasant laugh of the Skeletons were heard. &#xA0;They marched through the burning forest to appear in front of the town. &#xA0;Knights in armor were riding their Phantom Steeds, and they were letting out an overbearing atmosphere as they charged forward.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Tsk. &#xA0;We have to buy some time.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Ribito was the leader, and his words lit a fire under the fighting spirit of all the Warriors.</span></p><p><span style="">He had been the only survivor that came back after encountering the Undead army.</span></p><p><span style="">Kahng-woojin urged forward Shing Shing to come to the forefront.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What the hell is this?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">He frowned as he looked at the crude tower. &#xA0;This wasn&#x2019;t a Colony city.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;It seems they are the inhabitants of this planet.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Woojin pulled in his shadow.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Why did you guide me to a place where there isn&apos;t much EXP? &#xA0;Return.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">At his command, Ggaebi exited from Raksha&apos;s shadow to be absorbed into Woojin&apos;s shadow. &#xA0;Everything Ggaebi experienced was turned into information as it was absorbed into Woojin&#x2019;s brain.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hmmm. So this is the refugee camp for the indigenous people.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">The Warriors of the Ratick tribe had a worried look in their eyes as they lined up across the Undead army. &#xA0;The Immortal looked at them, and the shoddy town that was behind them.</span></p><p><span style="">A smile formed on his lips.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Sweep them.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">So what if it was a small amount of EXP? He had travelled all the way here, so he should at the very least harvest them. &#xA0;Indigenous people didn&apos;t drop any Bloodstones, and his Achievement Point wouldn&#x2019;t increase either.</span></p><p><span style="">Ke ke ke! </span></p><p><span style="">The army was about to march forward when a black smoke coalesced in front of the Warriors of the Ratick tribe. &#xA0;A Death Knight was summoned. </span></p><p><span style="">Koo-oohng! </span></p><p><span style="">He was on one knee and he bent forward.</span></p><p><span style="">[My King!] </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Relick?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">It was his servant, who submitted only through his Control.</span></p><p><span style="">It took Woojin 320 Control points to maintain him. &#xA0;However, it had been decreasing steadily.</span></p><p><span style="">[I ask you for magnanimity. &#xA0;Please spare them.] </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ho-oh.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Was it because Relick hadn&apos;t completed yielded to him? &#xA0;He had dared to appear in front of his king to deliver his wants.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;This is interesting.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Woojin got off Shing Shing.</span></p><p><span style="">There was a stirring behind Relick amongst the Warriors of the Ratick tribe. &#xA0;Woojin slowly walked towards Relick. &#xA0;It had been a long time since he experienced the push and pull between a defiant Familiar.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What if I say no?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">[&#x2026;&#x2026;.] </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What if I tell you to kill your fellow tribesmen?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">[I&apos;ll kill them.] </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ho.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Relick stabbed his curved sword into the ground, then he kowtowed as his head hit the ground. </span></p><p><span style="">[I&apos;ll do whatever you want.] </span></p><p><span style="">Woojin felt a familiar announcement ring in his ears.</span></p><p><span style="">&lt;Death Knight &apos;Relick&apos; is giving an entreaty.&gt; </span></p><p><span style="">&lt;Relick&apos;s Obedience is increasing. &#xA0;The needed Control is decreasing.&gt; </span></p><p><span style="">Woojin smirked as he opened both his arms wide.</span></p><p><span style="">Choo-choo-choot. </span></p><p><span style="">The Undead army that had burst through the burning forest was all gone. Woojin and Relick looked at each other, then Relick stamped his head against the floor once again. </span></p><p><span style="">&lt;Relick&apos;s Loyalty is increasing. &#xA0;The needed Control is decreasing.&gt; </span></p><p><span style="">&lt;Relick&apos;s Trust has been bolstered. The needed Control is decreasing.&gt; </span></p><p><span style="">The Control needed to maintain Relick was rapidly decreasing. &#xA0;In the end, it reached 1.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hmm. &#xA0;All right. &#xA0;I&apos;ll head back.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Woojin looked through the nervous faces from the Ratick tribe then he turned his back to them.</span></p><p><span style="">[To repay the king&apos;s generosity, I pledge my loyalty and sword&#x2026;.] </span></p><p><span style="">Relick turned back into black smoke as he disappeared, and Woojin took about 10 steps away. &#xA0;None of the Warrior from the Ratick race moved.</span></p><p><span style="">Raksha&apos;s eyes were overflowing with tears, and she looked at the trace left behind by Relick. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">However, Woojin suddenly came to a stop.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Wait a moment.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">He turned back, and his gaze came to rest on the top of the tower.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;That looks familiar.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">With the help of his eyesight, he was able to see a cloth hung atop the tower.</span></p><p><span style="">&lt;Broken Protection of Thrash&gt; </span></p><p><span style="">Woojin&apos;s eyes narrowed. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">It seemed he wouldn&apos;t be able to just head back.</span></p>
