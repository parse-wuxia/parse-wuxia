<p><span style="">Chapter 135 - Mivich (2)</span></p><p><span style="">Mivich laughed. </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Why do you think I&apos;m here?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Are you retarded? How the hell should I know?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;&#x2026;.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Woojin&apos;s words must have shocked Mivich, since his eyes were shaking. Afterwards, he let out a huge laugh.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ha ha ha. You were always like this. As expected. &#xA0;As expected of the Immortal!&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Mivich&apos;s words were filled with sarcasm. &#xA0;Woojin frowned.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Does your goal align with the Holy Maiden?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Holy Maiden? Melody? Ho-oh. Is she still alive?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;&#x2026;?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">What bullshit was he spouting again?</span></p><p><span style="">He had thought the Holy Maiden was dead?</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ha ha. Fate is quite the fickle mistress.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Stop talking in circles. &#xA0;Why not just speak plainly?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Mivich laughed at Woojin&apos;s temper.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ha ha. It seems you aren&apos;t immune to change either.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I changed?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;You are impatient now.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;&#x2026;.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Woojin&apos;s eyes blinked. </span></p><p><span style="">Him? </span></p><p><span style="">He had been impatient.</span></p><p><span style="">He relaxed his features, and he smirked.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Well, all right. I acknowledge it. &#xA0;I was impatient.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ho. &#xA0;You acknowledged that? &#xA0;I never expected the Immortal to act this way. The vengeful spirits of Alphen would probably revive just from the massive shock.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Woojin shrugged his shoulders at Mivich&apos;s playful words.</span></p><p><span style="">If he wanted to play, then he&apos;ll play.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;The Holy Maiden is helping me.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ho. &#xA0;So she betrayed us?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;You are the traitor.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;that isn&apos;t something you should talk about.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">In the first place, the Immortal was the one, who had never added his power to the coalition. No, they had fought repeatedly with each other, and they were barely able to form a non-aggression treaty with him. &#xA0;It wasn&apos;t something the monarch of Alandal should be saying so shamelessly.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Amongst the famous heroes of Alphen, you were the most shrewd one.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I was the most rational one.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Woojin smirked at Mivich&apos;s words.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Is that why you hitched yourself to Trahnet?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ha ha ha ha.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I guess you are embarrassed by it? I guess that is why you are laughing.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ha ha ha ha ha. No, it isn&apos;t anything like that.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Mivich laughed for a long time. Then he spoke with a serious look on his face.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;You got it all wrong.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;&#x2026;.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;We shouldn&#x2019;t have resisted against Trahnet in the first place.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Woojin stayed silent. &#xA0;He had a hunch that Mivich was more knowledgeable about the situation than him. If he stayed silent, Mivich would voluntarily let out the information.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;This is the new order. &#xA0;Even the gods can&apos;t stop his absolute law!&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Bullshit.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Traitor? That&#x2019;s incorrect. &#xA0;What about you then?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Me?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I&apos;ve fought my whole life for Alphen. In the end, I wasn&apos;t able to protect it. &#xA0;However, didn&apos;t you accept Trahnet without even putting up a fight?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What? I did?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Isn&apos;t the fact that you are standing here the proof?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;&#x2026;.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Why didn&apos;t you protect earth? &#xA0;Why are you a Dimensional lord now?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Dimensional lord. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">They were the most important member of Trahnet&apos;s team.</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin shook his head from side to side.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Do you have something you want to say to me?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;You are a coward. &#xA0;You quit on your homeland before you even fought for it.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Woojin had become a Dimensional lord.</span></p><p><span style="">He had pre-emptively become a Dimensional lord before he had attempted to protect earth. &#xA0;In the end, didn&apos;t he choose a path that would allow him to live?</span></p><p><span style="">He had acted like a politician, so Mivich didn&apos;t look kindly at Woojin.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Well, I guess that might be the wise choice. &#xA0;You preemptively gave up, and you adapted.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Woojin frowned. Mivich spat out those words, and his voice was seeped with anger.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Are you retarded?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;&#x2026;.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What adjustment? &#xA0;What absolute law are you talking about?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;It seems you are still ignoring reality. You won&apos;t be able to stop it.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Stop what?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Earth will be swallowed under Trahnet&apos;s influence...&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Why should I stop it?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Mivich stared at Woojin as if he was taken aback.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Why should I stop it?</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;&#x2026;.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Why should he stop it? &#xA0;Wasn&apos;t earth his home planet?</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;The beings of the Dimensions all have a special sentiment towards their homeland....&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Bullshit.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Woojin transformed his Warrior&apos;s Weapon into a long sword. &#xA0;It was a sword of adequate length. &#xA0;It was a bastard sword. &#xA0;It was a weapon he enjoyed using recently.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;If they want to invade, they can do as they like.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;&#x2026;.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I&apos;ll just kill them all.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Still, nothing will change in the end....&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Trahnet? His law?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;It is absolute.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I&apos;ll break it.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;&#x2026;?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Was this something that should be coming out a Dimensional lord&apos;s mouth? </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Then you will put yourself in danger&#x2026;.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Shut up, retard.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Woojin raised his bastard sword, and he took a step forward.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;&#x2026;.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;If you were afraid of losing your life, you should have never stepped onto the battlefield in the first place.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;&#x2026;!&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Accompanying those words, Woojin jumped high into the air, and he brought down his sword toward Mivich.</span></p><p><span style="">Ggahng! </span></p><p><span style="">Mivich pulled out his sword, which had been hidden within his robe. &#xA0;He blocked the attack. &#xA0;Woojin&apos;s last words caused a ripple within Mivich&#x2019;s heart, and his feelings were in a state of turmoil.</span></p><p><span style="">Shwahhk, kahng! Kah-ahng! </span></p><p><span style="">Mivich reflexively blocked Woojin&apos;s rough attacks.</span></p><p><span style="">When they exchanged several sword strikes, his shaken heart had calmed down. &#xA0;A smile spread across his lips.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I see.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">He shook off the sword strike, then he took off his robe.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Maybe you aren&apos;t the coward. &#xA0;Maybe I am.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">When he heard Mivich&apos;s words, Woojin mocked him.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;That&apos;s a given.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hoo.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">There was a smile on Mivich&apos;s lips.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;When did you learn to use sword?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Not too long ago.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hoot. &#xA0;Let&apos;s have a match.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Mivich got into his stance. &#xA0;A sharp spirit emanated from his entire body. &#xA0;The atmosphere was completely different from before.</span></p><p><span style="">Mivich was one of the top Grand Swordsman on Alphen.</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin was a Dual Class, but he was only a Rank AA Roused. Mivich had already reached the 9th Circle. &#xA0;He wasn&apos;t at a level where he could fight against a SS Rank Grand Swordsman.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Boys.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">At Woojin&apos;s call, the Death Knights started appearing accompanied by the black smoke.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;&#x2026;.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">In a flash, the situation became a 30:1 disadvantage. &#xA0;Mivich&apos;s eyebrows twitched.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Don&apos;t you think this is a bit cheap?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Woojin grinned.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Retard.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;&#x2026;.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Thirty Death Knights started closing in on Mivich. Mivich smiled as he calmly received the oppressive feeling bearing down on him.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Well, it can&apos;t be helped.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">His opponent was a Necromancer. &#xA0;He was the King of the Dead. &#xA0;He was Alandal&apos;s Monarch.</span></p><p><span style="">If Mivich wanted to plant his sword into the Immortal, he would have to get past his Undead Army.</span></p><p><span style="">Fortunately, the Lich wasn&apos;t present, so this might be possible...</span></p><p><span style="">This place was his home ground. &#xA0;It was Mivich&apos;s Meadow.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hoo-ooh-oohp.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">He took in a deep breath.</span></p><p><span style="">Poo-soo-soo.</span></p><p><span style="">As he continued to breathe, a formless energy gathered around him, and the power was injected into his body. &#xA0;Woojin frowned when there was a serious change to Mivich&#x2019;s power.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;This is going to take awhile.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">He hadn&apos;t fully recovered his level yet, yet he had come across a troublesome opponent. It was rare to find someone with this much power. &#xA0;The 72 Thrones may have that much.... </span></p><p><span style="">The light inside Woojin&apos;s eyes flickered for a moment.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Let me ask you a question.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What is it?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">The Immortal had significantly raised his fighting spirit, yet unlike before, he had a tinge of sympathy within his eyes. &#xA0;The Immortal was being agreeable.... &#xA0;It surprised Mivich.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;How come your Ranking is so low?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hoo hoo.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">When a Dimensional lord visits another Dimensional lord&apos;s Dungeon, it was possible to see each other&#x2019;s basic information. One could see the other&apos;s Ranking and name.</span></p><p><span style="">Mivich&apos;s Ranking was 4,231.</span></p><p><span style="">His Ranking was much lower than Woojin.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;My Ranking means nothing to me.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Are you bad at doing the Dimensional Battle? &#xA0;You just have to conduct Duels. &#xA0;If it&apos;s you, you should be quite close to the capabilities of Trahnet&apos;s 72 Thrones.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;It is irreversible.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Duels will eventually make you lose everything.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Woojin tilted his head in confusion. &#xA0;Was he afraid of death? &#xA0;Is that why he didn&apos;t like to Duel?</span></p><p><span style="">Mivich spoke as he looked at Woojin.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;You can&apos;t advance upwards through Duel. It&apos;s impossible to even challenge the Thrones through Duels.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Mivich spoke the truth.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;If your goal is to gain a Throne, you have to put more importance on the Dimensional Battles.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">There were only 72 Thrones, and it couldn&apos;t be possessed by anyone unworthy.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;An administrator doesn&apos;t need personal power. &#xA0;They need the ability to be able to supervise.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;&#x2026;.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Shall we continue with our unfinished fight?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Light was emitted by Mivich&apos;s sword. &#xA0;Black light was emitted by the weapons of the Death Knights, and their weapons clashed.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;An administrator&#x2026;.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Woojin used his magic as he pressured Mivich. &#xA0;Woojin wasn&apos;t used to performing the Warrior&apos;s Skill, and his opponent wasn&#x2019;t an easy foe.</span></p><p><span style="">Mivich was using his innate Domain skills, and he was letting out much stronger energy than what he had been capable on Alphen.</span></p><p><span style="">He might have to summon all of his Death Knights, who were on standby.</span></p><p><span style="">The knights, who surpassed life and death, continued to fight through the meadows.</span></p><p><span style="">*** </span></p><p><span style="">Mokdong Station&apos;s 4th Exit.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Shit.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">He let out the cuss words that had been bubbling up from within.</span></p><p><span style="">The news program that was giving a live update had been terminated. &#xA0;It seemed there was a problem with the communication infrastructure, so the internet was down. &#xA0;The smartphone was basically useless. He quickly turned on the car&apos;s radio to listen to the news.</span></p><p><span style="">Seoul was in a state of chaos.</span></p><p><span style="">It wasn&apos;t just Seoul. &#xA0;It was a mess in Daegoo, Gwahngjoo and Busan.</span></p><p><span style="">Japan, China, US and France all suffered Breaks.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x300C;Chee-chee-jeek. &#xA0;The powerful boss is controlling the monsters... Chee-chee-jeek. &#xA0;Weapons fire are having no effect on it. &#xA0;Chee-jeek.&#x300D; </span></p><p><span style="">This was different from the normal Dungeon Breaks. The monsters were under the control of another being. &#xA0;The monsters were dangerous just from being loosed on this world. &#xA0;However, they were now moving in an organized fashion, and the ramification of this fact was unimaginable.</span></p><p><span style="">If the monster hunts up until now could be characterized as hunts, the current situation was a game changer.</span></p><p><span style="">It was War. </span></p><p><span style="">They were moving in an organized fashion, so war was being carried out in various locations.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;This place is dangerous, chief.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I know that.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Woo-soonghoon chewed on his lips. The president wasn&apos;t showing any signs of coming out, and bad news were coming out from various parts of Seoul.</span></p><p><span style="">The monsters were moving towards Namsan in droves. He was worried about Alandal, which was nearby.</span></p><p><span style="">When the monsters appeared, they didn&apos;t go on a rampage. &#xA0;Instead, they organized into a group. &#xA0;The fact that the monsters could move in an orderly fashion put a bigger fear into the hearts of people. It felt as if they were about to face a bomb that was about to go off.</span></p><p><span style="">This phenomenon was occurring at various location within Seoul.</span></p><p><span style="">A large Cyclops had stationed himself at the Mokdong baseball stadium, and the monsters were &#xA0;gathering around the Cyclops. &#xA0;If they started to cause trouble, Mokdong station would be devastated in an instant.</span></p><p><span style="">It was probably best to evacuate before the monsters started their indiscriminate attack.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Shit. &#xA0;Let&apos;s retreat.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">If he stayed any longer by putting his trust in the president, he might die an early death.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Give me something to write a memo with.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hurry up and bring it to me.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Understood.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">The employee brought a memo pad from the car. &#xA0;Soonghoon quickly wrote the current state of affair of Seoul and the world.</span></p><p><span style="">Monsters were gathering in an organized fashion.</span></p><p><span style="">It was happening at Namsan, Mokdong baseball stadium, Gangnam, Seoul University, Suwon Hwaseong Fortress....</span></p><p><span style="">He wrote a brief summary about the news he had heard on the radio regarding Seoul and the world&#x2026;. </span></p><p><span style="">The memo paper was filled with information, and he taped it to the station&apos;s entrance.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hoo. &#xA0;Let&apos;s go.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;W...where&apos;s our destination?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Let&apos;s head to Alandal first.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">It would probably be the safest for him if he left Seoul. &#xA0;However, how could he be so disloyal and run away by himself? It was in name only, but he was considered to be Alandal&apos;s minister of foreign affairs. &#xA0;Even if he evacuated, he needed to do so with everyone.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;If I&apos;m with director Hong and director Che, it&apos;ll all work out.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">Hong-sunggoo and Che-haesol&apos;s power couldn&apos;t be ignored. &#xA0;They were Roused that could fight for the top spots amongst the Korean Roused and the Roused of the world.</span></p><p><span style="">Moreover, there would be a lot of military units around the Cheongwadae.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hurry up and come out, president. &#xA0;Or else we&apos;ll all die.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">He longingly looked at the barrier, which didn&apos;t show any signs of disappearing, as he spoke. &#xA0;Soonghoon and the employees got into their car, and they evacuated. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">After a long amount of time had passed, the barrier started to disappear.</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin exited with a haggard expression on his face.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What the hell? &#xA0;Where&apos;s everyone?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">It had been a hard fight. &#xA0;He wanted to relieve his stress by getting into a warm tub of water. &#xA0;However, Soonghoon and the employees from the secretary office was nowhere to be seen.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Huh?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Woojin frowned as he looked at memo stuck to the wall.</span></p><p><span style="">He didn&apos;t have the time to rest. &#xA0;He would have a hard time keeping up with this threat even if he had 10 bodies.</span></p>
