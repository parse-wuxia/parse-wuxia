<p>Chapter 164 - Bibi&apos;s Castle (3)</p><p><span style="">Over half of the participants in the assembly were representatives from foreign nations.</span></p><p><span style="">One of them was from Japan. &#xA0;He yelled out.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;In the end, aren&#x2019;t you just saying you are going to monopolize the spoils of war?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">The word, &apos;vanguard&apos;, might just be a pretty word to cover up the fact that Kahng-woojin was trying to monopolize all the glory.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Then you go first.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;...what are you..&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;If there is someone willing to go before me, I welcome it. &#xA0;I won&apos;t stop anyone. &#xA0;I&apos;ll just go when everyone in front of me gets wiped out.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;...&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">The man had nothing to say. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">Kahng-woojin had overwhelming strength.</span></p><p><span style="">That was the problem. &#xA0;The war itself broke down if Kahng-woojin was absent. &#xA0;Still, he wouldn&apos;t gain much if he just followed behind Kang-woojin&apos;s back...</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Why are you being so greedy?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;...&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I guess no one is taking this situation as serious as me? &#xA0;I&apos;m estimating 90% of the world&apos;s population would disappear in a month.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;...&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Kahng-woojin&apos;s words had caused a disturbance, but a heavy silence descended on the group.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Let&apos;s not get greedy. &#xA0;Let us pool our strength together.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">A good number of people became trouble at Woojin&apos;s words. &#xA0;Several people became surprised at his words. &#xA0;Melody had been watching from the side, and her surprise was beyond imagination.</span></p><p><span style="">&apos;The Immortal is trying to reason with others...&apos;</span></p><p><span style="">She never expected such a thing to happen. &#xA0;If she told this story to anyone on Alphen, they&apos;ll think she was making a joke. &#xA0;They would tell her to buzz off.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Please don&apos;t sugar coat it with your hopeful words. &#xA0;Even if we do start a wasteful war, wouldn&apos;t destruction be waiting for us in the end?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">A man&apos;s face alternately turned pale and red as he asked a question. &#xA0;Woojin smiled.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;In the end, Earth will probably be destroyed, but there is hope. &#xA0;We have to find a way to permanently destroy the Dungeons. &#xA0;We have to last until that time. &#xA0;What choice do we have?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin looked at the crowd, and he gave a meaningful laugh.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I&apos;m sure there are some of you that wants to take the easy road. &#xA0;There will be those like Lee-sahngho. &#xA0;You probably want to attach yourself to a Dimensional lord. &#xA0;I&apos;m sure there are traitors that would sell earth to save their own lives.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;...&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I&apos;m sure that it will happen. &#xA0;Those bastards are the first ones I will kill.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin stopped speaking, but none in the crowd was able to easily open their mouths. &#xA0;Some were making calculations regarding profit and loss. &#xA0;Some became resolutely determined on the course of action they would take. &#xA0;There were also those that couldn&apos;t think in such state of confusion.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;This is the end of the open data. &#xA0;This is the end of the guidance I&apos;m willing to provide before we have to act to save the earth.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">The topic was heavy and grim. &#xA0;However, Woojin was speaking in such a cheerful tone, so hope started to sprout in everyone&apos;s heart.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;All the Roused of earth should share in the task when the Dungeons Reset. &#xA0;You all have to do your best to clear them.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">They had to lessen the number of paths the enemies could use to invade earth.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;When a Dungeon Breaks, don&apos;t be cheap about using your resources. &#xA0;Do your best to eradicate the monsters.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">They had to defeat the enemies by being on the same page.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;The best defense is offense. &#xA0;Therefore, I&apos;ll be trying to find a way to demolish the Dungeons once and for all. &#xA0;This is why I&apos;ll be going to Alphen, which had been encroached on recently by Trahnet.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin spoke as if he had repeated these words to himself before.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I&apos;ll be taking a vanguard to Alphen tomorrow morning. &#xA0;You all have to do a good job protecting earth until I get back.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;...&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">It did seemed like Woojin would gone for an extended amount of time....</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;If you have any questions, I want you to direct it towards Prime minister Jung.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin turned around, and he left the stage.</span></p><p><span style="">Minchan replaced the empty spot with a dark expression on his face.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I have a question!&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Let me ask one first. &#xA0;How many members will be in this vanguard?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;The rights to the loots one obtains from the Alphen expedition....&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">The questions were pouring out, and Minchan was a bit faint when he became bombarded with the questions.</span></p><p><span style="">&apos;Ah...&apos;</span></p><p><span style="">He wanted to run away, but he was in charge of cleaning up after Kahng-woojin.</span></p><p><span style="">He started answering the questions one by one.</span></p><p><span style="">***</span></p><p><span style="">After exiting the KH hotel, Woojin immediately left towards Alandal. &#xA0;He searched for his mother and dongsaeng.</span></p><p><span style="">Sooah was playing with the dog, Bokhwee, which had gotten larger again. &#xA0;His mother had only eyes for her daughter, and she couldn&apos;t tear her eyes away from Sooah.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;You are back?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Yes. Hey, Sooah.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Yes, oppa?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Sooah ran up to Woojin.</span></p><p><span style="">Even Bokhwee was shaking his tail as he whined.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Are you having any weird dreams lately?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Nope. &#xA0;I don&apos;t dream any more.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">After joining the ranks of the Roused, Sooah returned to being her normal self.</span></p><p><span style="">She would be able to use her Holy Power, and she&apos;ll probably hear the god&apos;s voice sporadically.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;What about your abilities?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Heh heh. &#xA0;I&apos;m like a ghost.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Sooah looked at her two hands, which was dyed blue. &#xA0;When he saw the energy filled with Blessings, Woojin reacted like a magnet being repelled.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Other people really like it when I do this. &#xA0;It isn&apos;t working on oppa.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Oppa is a little bit different from others. &#xA0;Anyways, we are moving tomorrow.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Huh? Why are we suddenly moving?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">The one, who became agitated by Woojin&apos;s words, was his mother Lee-soogyung.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I bought a boat. &#xA0;We&apos;ll be living there.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;How can we live on a boat?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Mmm. &#xA0;It&apos;s a big one.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Is it something like a yacht? &#xA0;Does it have a kitchen inside?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;It is something similar.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;...all right.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;You don&apos;t want to ask me any more questions?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Lee-soogyung shook her head from side to side.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I know how hard you are working. &#xA0;I know how much you think about us. &#xA0;I know you have your reasons for doing this.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;...&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin just smiled. &#xA0;Sooah&apos;s ability had awakened. &#xA0;If he wanted to, he could take Sooah to his Dimensional Domain. &#xA0;However, his mother Lee-soogyung was different. &#xA0;She was a level 2.</span></p><p><span style="">One had to reach level 10 if one wanted to develop abilities of a 1st Circle. &#xA0;If one looked at her growth speed, it was very unlikely that she&apos;ll become a Roused.</span></p><p><span style="">This was why he had bought the aircraft carrier, which can move in a time of emergency. &#xA0;He was building the Colony city solely for Lee-soogyung.</span></p><p><span style="">He had gathered a significant amount of Dimensional Points. &#xA0;Even if he was absent from earth, the Colony could use the Points to defend itself.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I just wanted to give you a heads up.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;All right. &#xA0;If you are busy, you should go do your work.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Lee-soogyung had a look in her eyes as if she wanted more time to spend with him. &#xA0;However, she couldn&apos;t take time away from him, so she couldn&apos;t look him in the eyes.</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin felt her feeling, and he felt sorry. &#xA0;However, he just didn&apos;t have the time.</span></p><p><span style="">One hand couldn&apos;t block all ten hands that was coming towards him.</span></p><p><span style="">The enemies were numerous, and there were over several hundred entrances that led to earth.</span></p><p><span style="">It would be impossible to clear all the Dungeons in time. &#xA0;The battle would start to slowly shift from the Dungeons to earth.</span></p><p><span style="">He had to make it so that he could at the very least be able to summon Yong Yong.</span></p><p><span style="">He was curious about the goddess that had made Sooah her vassal. &#xA0;However, he couldn&apos;t find out more about her until she appeared again out of her own volition. &#xA0;He didn&apos;t even know her name, but she didn&apos;t seem like a malicious existence.</span></p><p><span style="">In the Alphen expedition, he&apos;ll save the surviving allied forces. &#xA0;Then he&apos;ll let Sooah learn everything about being a Holy Maiden from Melody.</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin visited Jiwon&apos;s room next.</span></p><p><span style="">He entered after knocking. &#xA0;When she saw Woojin, she scrambled towards him. &#xA0;Cindy was with Jiwon, so Woojin glanced at her.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Huh? She hasn&apos;t left yet?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;She received trauma from that time, and she knows this place is the safest location.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Safe......</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;We are going to move.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Huh?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Where? &#xA0;Where are you guys going?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">The surprised Cindy asked Woojin. &#xA0;He spoke in a nonchalant manner.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I bought a boat. &#xA0;We&apos;ll be moving there.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Huhk! &#xA0;Is it perhaps the aircraft carrier?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Any news regarding Woojin was published in a matter of minutes. &#xA0;His purchase of the aircraft carrier was a topic of discussion for the past couple days.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Yes.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">At Woojin&apos;s words, Cindy&apos;s expression darkened.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;What is it? &#xA0;If you have something to say, then say it. &#xA0;Stop acting like a constipated puppy.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Do you think I can go too?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Did you retire?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;No... &#xA0;I haven&apos;t, but...&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;It is only for the employees of Alandal.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">To be more precise, it was for the employees that took up the citizenship up Alandal upon their hire. &#xA0;It was for their family. &#xA0;He didn&apos;t want his employees to hesitate in going out to fight. &#xA0;He had arranged it in a way that their families would be protected at all cost.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;So I&apos;m not allowed on it?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;What do you know how to do?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Huh?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;You are useless, so why should I let you on the boat?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;...&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">It seemed Cindy had received a significant amount of shock from his words. &#xA0;She looked at him with a blank expression. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">When had she ever been treated as being useless before?</span></p><p><span style="">It seemed Cindy&apos;s pride had taken a big hit, so Do-jiwon intervened.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Cindy is under my care... &#xA0;Can&apos;t she say until she gets a little bit better?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;What is she recuperating from?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin looked Cindy up and down.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Hmm. &#xA0;She doesn&apos;t look like she is hurting anywhere.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;The trauma her mind received from that event....&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin smirked when Jiwon advocated for Cindy.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Even a kid is coping better than her. &#xA0;Is she being a little bit too whiny?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Cindy bit her lower lips at Woojin&apos;s words. &#xA0;She recalled Sooah, whom she had seen before. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">She was aware of it. &#xA0;She knew there are a lot of people that were living a hard life on top of having mental trauma. &#xA0;She knew she was speaking with a full stomach. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">Cindy&apos;s eyes turned red.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Yes, I was immature.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I&apos;m glad you realize that now.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Wow... &#xA0;His words were...</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I&apos;ll be going.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;All right. &#xA0;I&apos;ll see you next time.&quot; </span></p><p><span style="">Cindy was trying hard not to cry, and she strode out of the room.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Cindy!&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Jiwon was about to chase after her, but Woojin grabbed her arm.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Ah. &#xA0;Let me go.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;What are you going to do if you catch up to her?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Did she really need comforting at this moment?</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;You were too harsh. &#xA0;You could have told her in a more softer manner.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Kang-woojin was too much of a straight shooter. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">Jiwon&apos;s reproachful gaze slid off of him. &#xA0;Woojin shrugged his shoulders.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;For what purpose?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;...whatever. &#xA0;Let me go.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Hmm.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Jiwon looked up at Woojin.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;When you act like this, I get really scared. &#xA0;Will you throw me away like her if I&apos;m useless?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;No. &#xA0;The weight of your soul differs from her soul.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;...?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Tears were about to be shed from Jiwon&apos;s eyes. &#xA0;She turned her head away from him, and she headed towards the direction Cindy had disappeared to. &#xA0;Woojin was left alone, and he shrugged his shoulder.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Hmm.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;You were a bit too harsh, hyung.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Do-jaemin suddenly appeared out of the darkness. &#xA0;Woojin looked at him with a sour expression.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;...how long were you there?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I saw the whole thing.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;So you&apos;ve grown a little?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Jaemin&apos;s camouflage ability was on par with Ggaebi now.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Heh. &#xA0;Anyways, when is Sunggoo hyung-nim coming back?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Ah, I don&apos;t know. &#xA0;He&apos;ll be back when it&apos;s time.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">He&apos;ll be coming back after he finished his training. &#xA0;Woojin had no idea how long that would be, but Sunggoo would be coming back within a day. &#xA0;He needed Sunggoo and Jaenis in the Alphen expedition. &#xA0;The presence of both of them were a must.</span></p><p><span style="">***</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Hoo-hook.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">When she exited the door, Cindy let out the tears she had been holding back.</span></p><p><span style="">She knew it. &#xA0;Her whining didn&apos;t suit this crazy new world.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Uh uh? Excuse me.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">She ran outside as she cried. &#xA0;The employee that had been passing by her tried to call after her, but she didn&apos;t look back.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;You evil bastard. &#xA0;Hoo-ehhhhng&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">She couldn&apos;t control her tears. &#xA0;The fact that she had been attracted to such a cold man for even a brief moment made her that much more angry at herself.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;If you go out right now.....&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">The employee was calling after her, but she continued with her walk of shame.</span></p><p><span style="">&apos;Ah, this is so embarrassing!&apos;</span></p><p><span style="">She planned on calling her manager immediately after she exited this place. &#xA0;She headed towards the front gate.</span></p><p><span style="">She followed the wall, and she arrived at the front gate. &#xA0;Several dozen cameras started flashing at the same time. &#xA0;They hadn&apos;t been waiting for her. &#xA0;The reporters were on standby. &#xA0;They were targeting anyone that was leaving this place.</span></p><p><span style="">Cindy had gotten herself caught in this maelstrom.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Wow. &#xA0;What the hell? &#xA0;Isn&apos;t that Cindy?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Jackpot! &#xA0;Why is she crying right now?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Is it a scandal with the king of Alandal?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Click, click!</span></p><p><span style="">Her tears dried up when she heard the endless soud of the shutters being pressed. &#xA0;She hadn&apos;t expected to run into this swarm of reporters, so she had a dazed expression on her face.</span></p><p><span style="">&apos;Ah. &#xA0;This is bad.&apos;</span></p><p><span style="">She had regained her wits too late. &#xA0;Her eyes became focused again.</span></p><p><span style="">She was embarrassed, taken aback and flustered.</span></p><p><span style="">She had to get out of this situation, but she couldn&apos;t come up with a solution.</span></p><p><span style="">Her unsightly look was secondary. &#xA0;What would happen to her public image when the gossip tabloids print out stories about her?</span></p><p><span style="">She had created a situation that was ripe for gossip. &#xA0;Alandal was the hottest news around right now, and an entertainer had just exited the place in tears....</span></p><p><span style="">She didn&apos;t know how to minimize the damage, so her eyes started to fill with tears again. &#xA0;She turned her body away, but the sounds of camera shutters being pressed didn&apos;t end.</span></p><p><span style="">She felt a panic attack coming on. &#xA0;Her world started to spin in a dizzying fashion.</span></p><p><span style="">At that moment, a warm fire fell from the sky and it encased her.</span></p><p><span style="">Hwa-roo-roohk.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;...&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">When she turned around, there was a burning man there.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Uh? Why are you crying?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;...hoo-oohk. Ka-ah-ahng. &#xA0;Hoo-oohk-oong. &#xA0;That evil son of a bitch...hoo-ohng. &#xA0;The reporters and their cameras...ooh-eehhhng.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Hmmm. &#xA0;Please don&apos;t cry.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Human Flame.</span></p><p><span style="">The flame that was surrounding Sunggoo disappeared, and it ignited somewhere else.</span></p><p><span style="">Puh-puh-puhk!</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Uh uh?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Ahk! &#xA0;What the hell!&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">The lens from the cameras all exploded, and all the memory cards started to burn. &#xA0;Cindy was so surprised that she looked up at Sunggoo&apos;s face.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Heh heh. &#xA0;Are you from Yuri Girls? &#xA0;Can you give me an autograph inside?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;...&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Hong-sunggoo&apos;s bright and untainted smile was reflected in Cindy&apos;s tears.</span></p>
