<p>Chapter 197 - Trahnet (2)</p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Professor Toppler&#xFF01;&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Huh? What is it?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Toppler heard the unusually urgent voice, so he followed suit by asking his question in an impatient manner. &#xA0;The day of the decision was getting closer, and it felt as if he was &#xA0;walking on thin ice everyday.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Kahng-woojin went to meet Iello.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Professor Toppler yelled out in surprise.</span></p><p><span style="">It was still too early for them to meet. &#xA0;No, this had never happened before. &#xA0;Currently, they were off the preordained path, so it made him worried and anxious.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What has caused this change&#x2026;.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Things weren&#x2019;t going as planned. &#xA0;However, none of their plans had succeeded before, so it was true that Toppler felt a sense of expectancy.</span></p><p><span style="">Kahng-woojin was meeting Iello before he acquired his qualification.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Please ready the Toppler&#x2019;s ship.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Wouldn&#x2019;t it be too dangerous?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Toppler got up from his seat.</span></p><p><span style="">He had dedicated his whole life to this old research room, and he took in the whole room.</span></p><p><span style="">There was no longer a future on the Moon World.</span></p><p><span style="">If he didn&#x2019;t want to miss this opportunity, he had to be in a place where he could instantly react to changes.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I&#x2019;m going to earth.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Professor Toppler looked to the sky as he looked at the black planet.</span></p><p><span style="">*** </span></p><p><span style="">After Woojin exited the Portal, he looked over the pictures taken by his recon team. &#xA0;He just blinked at what he saw.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Their number increased this much in just a day?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;Yes. &#xA0;Even the government forces stationed at Suwon was told to retreat to Pyongtaek.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Hmm.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin stroked his chin. &#xA0;The Seoul reflected on the screen was already a paradise for monsters. &#xA0;No, it wasn&#x2019;t just the monsters. &#xA0;The place was crawling with Dimensional lords.</span></p><p><span style="">Amongst the Dimensional lords, he saw some familiar faces. He saw the enormous octopus named Dread, and the Golden Dragon Rajakui.</span></p><p><span style="">Now he was sure that the previous Dungeon Breaks in Seoul was directed by Iello.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;This guy is worse than Ibrit.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">He saw a lot of Dimensional lords.</span></p><p><span style="">They were acting as middleman for controlling the monsters.</span></p><p><span style="">The death of great lord Iello wouldn&#x2019;t stop all of this. &#xA0;Woojin would also have to kill the several dozen Dimensional lords under Iello.</span></p><p><span style="">These beings were all gathered in Seoul, and they were making preparations. &#xA0;It was obvious as to whom they were waiting for.</span></p><p><span style="">They were gunning for him.</span></p><p><span style="">They had all their ducks in a row to face him.</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin had a smile on his face as he looked at the obvious trap.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;This will push me to max level.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The sacrifices needed for him to reach level 99 was all present.</span></p><p><span style="">How could this be words of a person, who should be worried?</span></p><p><span style="">However, he no longer had to travel to various locations to hunt. &#xA0;This would make his task less laborious.</span></p><p><span style="">Currently, Jaemin was going all out as he continued the Dimensional Battles. &#xA0;Thanks to Jaemin, he was gaining a lot of Dimensional Points. &#xA0;Now his return to Seoul would allow him to increase his Achievement Points. &#xA0;He&#x2019;ll be able to gain a massive amount of Points.</span></p><p><span style="">He&#x2019;ll have enough Points to purchase the miscellaneous Ingredients using the Dimensional Store and the Achievement Store. &#xA0;When the battle ends, he&#x2019;ll be able to gain the last Item called Thrash&#x2019;s Glory.</span></p><p><span style="">There were two possibilities. &#xA0;He might gain a clue when he gathered the Thrash&#x2019;s Set Items or he might gain a clue when he reached the max level of 99.</span></p><p><span style="">He could feel that he was close to Thrash&#x2019;s Executioner.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;We don&apos;t need to land. &#xA0;I&#x2019;ll be back after I finish this.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes. &#xA0;Please return safely.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin patted Minchan&#x2019;s shoulder, and he walked out onto the deck.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Oppa.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Uh? &#xA0;Why did you come out here? &#xA0;I told you stay inside.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I just&#x2026;.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin lifted Sooah, and he came face to face with her uncomfortable face.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Are you ill?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;No.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Then what is it?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;can you not go?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Huh?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I...it&#x2019;s nothing.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;You rascal. &#xA0;You should stay inside with mother. &#xA0;You shouldn&#x2019;t come out on a whim.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin put Sooah down, then he started walking again.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Let&#x2019;s hurry up and go, master.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">It had been a long time, since she had stepped onto the battlefield with her master. &#xA0;This was why she was excited as she urged Woojin forward. &#xA0;By his side, the Death Knights and Lich Jaenis was making preparations as they waited.</span></p><p><span style="">[The end is near.]</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">[If we can&#x2019;t find clues to finding the Executioner&#x2026;.]</span></p><p><span style="">If he couldn&#x2019;t gain any information after completing the two requirements&#x2026;.. &#xA0;Woojin turned down Lich Jaenis&#x2019; worry.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;We&#x2019;ll think about it when we run into that problem.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">[Lord.]</span></p><p><span style="">There was a Death Knight a head taller and bulkier than all the other knights.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;It has been awhile, since you&#x2019;ve come out. &#xA0;How is it?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">[I just carry my master&#x2019;s orders.]</span></p><p><span style="">Kiba had always been left behind to guard the Dimensional Domain. &#xA0;It was boring work, yet Kiba didn&#x2019;t show any signs of complaint. &#xA0;Woojin tapped Kiba on his shoulder bone before he headed towards the Blood Dragon. </span></p><p><span style="">[What is your wish?]</span></p><p><span style="">When it came down to it, the Dragon wasn&#x2019;t able to grant a wish, yet it kept asking the question. &#xA0;It was his Dragon, who suffered under dementia.</span></p><p><span style="">Then there was Golem Dolsae, who had turned itself into blood for the Dragon.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Do whatever the hell you want. &#xA0;Run amok to your heart&#x2019;s content.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">[It&#x2019;ll be my pleasure.]</span></p><p><span style="">The Blood Dragon flopped over the deck as if it was diving.</span></p><p><span style="">Shwahhk.</span></p><p><span style="">When it unfurled its wings, the enormous body descended towards Seoul.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Let us go too.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style=""> [Ooh-oh!]</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin summoned Shing Shing, and he got on.</span></p><p><span style="">The Death Knights got on their own Phantom Steeds, and they jumped off the deck.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hoo-hooht.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Bibi no longer looked like a child. &#xA0;She summoned her staff for transportation. &#xA0;She&#x2019;ll show everyone the true power of the Illusion Witch.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hoo. &#xA0;We&#x2019;ll focus on defending our fortress.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes, sir!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">At Minchan&#x2019;s order, the employees moved in perfect order. &#xA0;The members of the Phantom Unit were each assigned a Wyvern, and they were placed on standby. &#xA0;They were readied just in case.</span></p><p><span style="">They weren&#x2019;t going to be used in battle. &#xA0;The king had ordered all of them to protect the fortress.</span></p><p><span style="">He wanted to monopolize the EXP, but he also wanted to prepare for a possibility for a sneak attack. &#xA0;Sooah had to be protected.</span></p><p><span style="">*** </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;That bastard is coming.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Iello was at the ice palace located at the center of the Thorn Tree. &#xA0;He looked into the sky.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Let us rescue the contaminated earth from this most troublesome thorn.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">As he stood up from his seat, he gave an order to the several dozen Dimensional lords, who followed him.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Kill the Immortal.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">They&#x2019;ll kill the bastard, then Iello would find the earth&#x2019;s Code.</span></p><p><span style="">This was the only way he&#x2019;ll be able to rule over this perilous earth.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ooh-ohhh!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The Gold Dragon Rajakui pushed off the roof of a building. &#xA0;The several Dimensional lords and the monsters capable of flight rose into the air.</span></p><p><span style="">Kwah-gwahng!</span></p><p><span style="">The Gold Dragon and the Blood Dragon crashed into each other. &#xA0;They rolled across the ground.</span></p><p><span style="">[You are too young to be able to handle the passage of time.]</span></p><p><span style="">[Hoohng. &#xA0;You ugly ball of blood!] </span></p><p><span style="">Koo-oohng, koong!</span></p><p><span style="">The roads became a mess, and the buildings impacted by their bodies crumbled. &#xA0;When the Dragons started to fight, both army clashed against each other.</span></p><p><span style="">[My soldiers!]</span></p><p><span style="">[Slaughter all of them!]</span></p><p><span style="">All the Skeleton Soldiers and Skeleton Magicians under the Death Knights were summoned. &#xA0;The already chaotic battleground became much more chaotic.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Immortal&#x2026;.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">A bitter sound forced its way out from Iello&#x2019;s lips.</span></p><p><span style="">If the Immortal had remained as being Kahng-woojin, they could have painted a big picture together&#x2026;.</span></p><p><span style="">If they couldn&#x2019;t do it together, Iello had to make up for the other.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I&#x2019;ll kill you.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">He&#x2019;ll do it by killing him&#x2026;.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;H...he&#x2019;s coming&#xFF01;&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Kahng-woojin and the Death Knights looked angry as they descended from the sky. &#xA0;Lee-sahngho yelled out in fear.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;&#x2026;&#x2026;.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Zzzzzzng.</span></p><p><span style="">Blades made out of ice started to grow from Iello&#x2019;s hands as they stacked. &#xA0;He formed an enormous saw blade sword.</span></p><p><span style="">Chwahhhk.</span></p><p><span style="">Iello pushed off the floor of the ice palace, and the body Iello shot up into the sky like a needle in flight.</span></p><p><span style="">Ggah-ah-ahng!</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin changed his Warrior&#x2019;s Weapon into a sword, and he blocked Iello&#x2019;s attacks.</span></p><p><span style="">Kah-ahng, gwahng!</span></p><p><span style="">Each attacks were increasing in strength, and the shockwaves started to ring out into the surrounding.</span></p><p><span style="">King of the Dead.</span></p><p><span style="">The Death Knight respected their King more than any other being in existence. &#xA0;This was why they went past Woojin to charge into the battlefield.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;B...bastards!&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Lee-sahngho pushed both his arms forward as he tried to use his Telekinesis&#x2026;..</span></p><p><span style="">Kwah-jeek!</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Kwahhhk&#xFF01;&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The crude axe passed by, and Lee-sahngho&#x2019;s two arms fell to the floor..</span></p><p><span style="">[Scream for me.]</span></p><p><span style="">Death Knight Kiba snarled as he revealed his grotesque tusks.</span></p><p><span style="">[My King has arrived.]</span></p><p><span style="">The royal procession was occurring, so a march had to be present.</span></p><p><span style="">[Scream louder for him!]</span></p><p><span style="">Chwahhhk!</span></p><p><span style="">The enormous blade of the axe sliced open his neck.</span></p><p><span style="">Slaughter and the screams of madness would open the path of his king.</span></p><p><span style="">Kiba&#x2019;s axe started to dance.</span></p><p><span style="">The fragments of ice was sent towards him like a hailstorm, and it impacted on his defense. &#xA0;It was more annoying than the endless swords strikes flying towards Woojin.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;You are pretty good.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Iello&#x2019;s transparent face moved at Woojin&#x2019;s invidious remark.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;&#x2026;&#x2026;.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin&#x2019;s eyes narrowed when Iello refused to reply.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Have I seen you before?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I won&#x2019;t converse with a bastard, who lost his sense of self.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The only thing Iello wanted was a mortal combat.</span></p><p><span style="">When one gained a Dimensional Fragment, one could be revived after time passed. &#xA0;It would be enough. &#xA0;Everything will end, and everything would just turn back to the beginning.</span></p><p><span style="">Then he would live an eternal life as a ruler&#x2026;..</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Bullshit.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">He had lost his sense of self?</span></p><p><span style="">If what he had lost was his sense of self, then he&#x2019;ll make Iello lose his life.</span></p><p><span style="">Kwahhhhng.</span></p><p><span style="">The sword of Woojin and Iello started to clashed against each other again.</span></p><p><span style="">*** </span></p><p><span style="">Third Gate Runway, Moon World.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I cannot let you depart.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What? &#xA0;Did you forget who I am?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">At Toppler&#x2019;s baffled voice, the Gate Guard shook his head from side to side in a firm manner.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Who doesn&apos;t know about Dr. Toppler?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Then I want you to immediately open the Gate. &#xA0;Our future and lives depends on me solving this problem.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;If you want to use it, please receive permission from the Council.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Professor Toppler&#x2019;s face crumbled. &#xA0;The council was getting in his way.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;It doesn&#x2019;t matter if you try to convince me. &#xA0;It would be much faster if you attend the Council meeting.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;&#x2026;&#x2026;.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">The Gate guard was just doing his job.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Shit.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Dr. Toppler changed direction, and he headed towards the Council. &#xA0;The walls were like windows of a green house. &#xA0;It was transparent. &#xA0;Toppler could see bright stars across the ceiling..</span></p><p><span style="">He looked at the closest star.</span></p><p><span style="">It was a dying black planet, and the sight made his heart feel more desperate.</span></p><p><span style="">The soldiers guarding the Council chamber became nervous when he showed up.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Open immediately!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;You need permission to enter&#x2026;.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Pshh-oong.</span></p><p><span style="">Before the soldiers could protest again, Toppler opened the door. &#xA0;&#xA0;He walked towards the Council chamber where he could find the council members. &#xA0;Twelve council members were sitting in a circle. &#xA0;They welcomed the professor.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Please allow me to use the space shuttle.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">At Toppler&#x2019;s determined voice, an old council member spoke.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;You shouldn&#x2019;t be going to earth, professor. &#xA0;We should lock you up in isolation.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;You willfully went out of your way to contact the admin in charge of the deletion.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;&#x2026;&#x2026;.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Another council member took up the thread of the sentence. &#xA0;A middle aged woman with a sharp face spoke. &#xA0;She didn&#x2019;t hide her anger.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;You dared to scheme such dangerous plans without our knowledge.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;This is for the survival of the Moon World&#xFF01;&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Huh. &#xA0;You want to revive the god of Destruction for our survival?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;It is possible&#x2026;.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Kah-ahng!</span></p><p><span style="">A middle-aged man with red hair sat in middle seat. &#xA0;He slammed his hand on the table.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Speaker Shelt&#x2026;.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Your theory has merit, but the risk is too high.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Yes, it was true.</span></p><p><span style="">This was why he had a plan, but he hadn&#x2019;t received permission to carry it out.</span></p><p><span style="">Professor Toppler had secretly attempted to carry his plan. &#xA0;He had attempted to contact Kahng-woojin away from the eyes of the Council members, because they opposed his plan.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;It is possible to carry out this plan! &#xA0;There is no point in supporting the Recovery Admin. &#xA0;We are just wasting our time.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">When Professor Toppler spoke with fire, Speaker Shelt tried to convince him with a calm voice. &#xA0;Toppler&#x2019;s ability was undeniable, but his actions tended to be extreme at times.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;We can shore up the shortcomings in the professor&#x2019;s plan, and we can implement it next time. &#xA0;I&#x2019;m sure it won&#x2019;t be too late to do so.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Professor Toppler&#x2019;s face was filled with despair at the Speaker&#x2019;s words.</span></p><p><span style="">Did the Moon World have a future? &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">Their resources were almost depleted, and they couldn&#x2019;t survive under their own efforts.</span></p><p><span style="">The fear was preventing them from stepping forward, and they might die in place.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;We might not have another chance if we don&#x2019;t act right now!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;The professor&#x2019;s rash actions had already caused a change.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Kahng-woojin hadn&#x2019;t acquired all the keys, yet he had met Iello. &#xA0;The result of this meeting couldn&#x2019;t be predicted, so everyone in the Council had their nerves on edge.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;For a short amount of time, let us place the professor in isolation.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">At the Speaker&#x2019;s declaration, the soldiers grabbed both of Toppler&#x2019;s arms.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;It isn&#x2019;t a threat. &#xA0;This is an opportunity.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Just because the horse is exhausted doesn&#x2019;t mean we have to climb atop a lion.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">They wanted to be rescued&#x2026;.</span></p><p><span style="">He was still the Moon World&#x2019;s only hope. &#xA0;&#xA0;A despairing Toppler was dragged away, and the Speaker spoke into the microphone to finalize the decision made by the council.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Please send Leone&#x2019;s ship to earth. &#xA0;Please help Iello achieve victory.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The large number of Reset was proof. &#xA0;They had to do as they always do&#x2026;.</span></p>
