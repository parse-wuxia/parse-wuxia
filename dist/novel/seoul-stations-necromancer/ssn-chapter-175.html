<p><span style="">Chapter 175 - Aria&apos;s Temple (1)&#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">Minchan surveyed all the reporters.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;There&apos;s a mountain fire. &#xA0;What would you do about it?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">When Minchan asked a question out of left field, a reporter in the first row answered in an unguarded moment.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;We have to put out the fire.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;What if it wasn&apos;t a fire? &#xA0;What if it was an active volcano?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Minchan met eyes with the young reporter.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Then we have to run away.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;What if eventually there is nowhere to run away?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;...what are you trying to say?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I&apos;m saying we have a different role to play.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Minchan spoke in a confident tone.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;When one is at the scene of a fire, one would separate the rescue team, and the firefighting team.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;...&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;The king of Alandal is finding a way to permanently stop the Dungeons, which erupts more often than the volcanoes. &#xA0;Shouldn&apos;t we do our best to block and endure the attacks until he does?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">The reporter had a cold expression on his face.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;What are you trying to say?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;You don&apos;t understand what I just said? &#xA0;Do they let people, who hadn&apos;t graduate primary school, become reporters these days?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">The reporter&apos;s face turned red at Minchan&apos;s combative words.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;How can anyone not understand something of that level? &#xA0;I&apos;m asking for Alandal&apos;s official stance. &#xA0;Are you willing to search for this method even as all Koreans are wiped out?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Minchan stood up from his seat in response to the angry words of the reporter.</span></p><p><span style="">There was nothing more ugly than a reporter, who had lost his cool. &#xA0;It was rarely worth it to engage such a person.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I...what I&apos;m...&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">The reporter stood up as he immediately tried to take back the words he had spoken. &#xA0;He had said those words when he was in an agitated state. &#xA0;Minchan glared at him.</span></p><p><span style="">What would his king have said in such a situation? &#xA0;Would he endlessly accept such selfish tantrums from people?</span></p><p><span style="">It seemed being a Prime Minister of Alandal wasn&apos;t that great a job to have.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;If you can&apos;t comprehend what I am trying to say, I&apos;ll try to lower myself to speak at your level.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Minchan&apos;s eyes widened at his own rough words, and the reporters looked at him with surprised rabbit eyes.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;There should be a limit on how much you all should whine. &#xA0;Take responsibility for guarding your own lives. &#xA0;Even if you bastards don&apos;t cry about it, Alandal is devoting all our resources into saving earth.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;...!&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Minchan turned his back on them, and he was about to exit the press conference. &#xA0;Woo-soonghoon quickly came up to him, and he whispered into Jung-minchan&#x2019;s ears.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Is it ok to just leave like this?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Hoo. &#xA0;Let the chips fall where they may.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;.....&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Ah. &#xA0;It seemed the Prime Minister was under considerable amount of stress.</span></p><p><span style="">Woo-soonghoon nodded his head heavily. &#xA0;The words had already been spoken...</span></p><p><span style="">Moreover, even if they were dual citizens, weren&apos;t they more of a citizens of Alandal than Korea?</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;We&apos;ll conclude the press conference.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">While the reporters were speaking noisily to each other, the press conference came to an end. The end was more disordered than the beginning of the press conference.</span></p><p><span style="">- Alandal taking the independent route? &#xA0;What about the cooperation between Korea and Alandal?</span></p><p><span style="">- The request given by the people of Korea was ignored. &#xA0;Congress wonders if Alandal&apos;s Korean citizenship should be revoked.</span></p><p><span style="">- An announcement was made by the Prime Minister of Alandal! &#xA0;He is working for the world, not Korea.</span></p><p><span style="">Even if one excluded the copycat articles that were being put up by the minute, over several dozen new articles regarding Alandal was being put up.</span></p><p><span style="">Jung-minchan tore his eyes away from the monitor, and he sunk deep into his chair.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Hoo-ooh.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Are you doing ok?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Michan smirked at Woo-soonghoon&apos;s words.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;It is frustrating that they don&apos;t understand what we are trying to do.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">He wanted to save earth. &#xA0;Korea was important to him.</span></p><p><span style="">However, the forest was burning. &#xA0;Would it make a difference if a single tree was saved? &#xA0;In the end, it was more important to put out the fire.</span></p><p><span style="">Kahng-woojin was working harder than anyone to make this happen....</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Well, nothing has changed for us.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Huh?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Did you forget what our king said? &#xA0;There will be no nations soon. &#xA0;A world where morality collapses will come...&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Mmmm.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">He did remember Kahng-woojin saying that. &#xA0;However, at the time, he had thought Woojin had said those words to ramp up the sense of crisis. &#xA0;If one considered what was happening around the world right now, Kahng-woojin&apos;s words didn&apos;t sound like an idle threat anymore.</span></p><p><span style="">It could happen for real. If people lost trust in their government in such a tense environment, there might really come a time when there will be no governments.</span></p><p><span style="">The scary part was that this scenario didn&apos;t seem too far away.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I&apos;m fine with the status quo right now.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;What are you talking about?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Woo-soonghoon shrugged his shoulders.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;What right do I have to talk about the defense of the human race? &#xA0;I just know that everything will turn out well if the king succeeds in his mission. &#xA0;I don&apos;t feel the need to go beyond my own pond.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">He went from being a handphone salesman to being a founding member of this guild. Now he was the personal secretary of a king, who had massive influence over the world.</span></p><p><span style="">He was satisfied with his station, and he didn&apos;t feel the need to advance more in life.</span></p><p><span style="">No, he had been placed in a position he was under-qualified for.</span></p><p><span style="">He didn&apos;t plan on getting greedy, so he didn&apos;t feel any pressure. &#xA0;He&apos;ll do the work he had always done. &#xA0;He just had to do well in running errands for Kahng-woojin. &#xA0;He just had to do what he was told.</span></p><p><span style="">Woo-soonghoon still held this mentality even now.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;You really are...&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Jung-minchan shook his head from side to side.</span></p><p><span style="">He was Alandal&apos;s Prime Minister. &#xA0;He didn&apos;t deny that the pressure and responsibility was recently getting to him.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Yes. &#xA0;We just have to follow our king.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Of course.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">They had always picked up after Kahng-woojin&apos;s accident. &#xA0;However, Jung-minchan had caused the accident this time...</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;You were right to roast them. &#xA0;Even I feel better after it.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Hoo hoo.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">He regretted turning the press into his enemies by saying something unnecessary, but his feelings were comforted a little bit.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I guarantee it. &#xA0;You were 100 times more lenient to the press than our king.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Soonghoon. &#xA0;You... Huh huh.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Minchan started to laugh.</span></p><p><span style="">So this was why the king kept Woo-soonghoon by his side.</span></p><p><span style="">Minchan thought he had a little bit better understanding now.</span></p><p><span style="">***</span></p><p><span style="">He was on the road after finding the location of Aria&apos;s Temple.</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin was atop his Phantom Steed Shing Shing, and he was picking at his ears.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Ah. &#xA0;My ears are itching.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Maybe we should rest a little bit before we go any further?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Melody was behind Woojin, and she grabbed him tightly as if she was afraid of falling off.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;No. &#xA0;It&apos;s all right.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;....&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">When silence greeted him, Woojin glanced backwards. &#xA0;He saw the pale-faced Melody. &#xA0;It seemed she hadn&apos;t said those words in concern for Woojin. &#xA0;She wanted to rest.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;...let&apos;s take a break.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin stopped Shing Shing, and he looked at his surrounding. &#xA0;There was a small hill, and a stream was flowing between a rock outcropping. &#xA0;However, the water smelled foul as if something had died upstream, so the water wasn&apos;t fit for consumption.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Ggaebi. Check if there are any Dungeons or Colonies nearby.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">[I will do so.]</span></p><p><span style="">Ggaebi&apos;s true form slipped out of Woojin&apos;s shadow, and he started scouting the surrounding land.</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin didn&apos;t plan on avoiding his enemies. &#xA0;If they were present, he would clean them up.</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin opened his Inventory to take out water he could boil. &#xA0;He was also going to take out simple ingredients he could cook....</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;They ate it all.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Jaemin was the only one he had given access to his Inventory through the Dimensional Storage. &#xA0;Numerous survivors of the Coalition were gathering at his Colony, and it seemed the food and water in his possession was given to these people.</span></p><p><span style="">However, the Colony City was formed now. &#xA0;They would now have the means to purchase Items from the City&apos;s stores with Bloodstones. &#xA0;They didn&apos;t need to raid his Inventory anymore.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Let&apos;s see.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin opened his Achievement Store. &#xA0;He purchased food, water, chairs and a table. &#xA0;He set it up in front of him.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;....&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Melody silently watched the sight. &#xA0;Woojin nodded his head towards her.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Why don&apos;t you sit?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Yes.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Melody had used her Holy Power called Aria&apos;s Blessing.</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin&apos;s Familiars were extremely incompatible with Aria&apos;s power, so she hadn&apos;t been able to use her powers on the Phantom Steed. &#xA0;She got motion sickness from riding a horse she was unfamiliar with.</span></p><p><span style="">When she got off, she immediately asked for Aria&apos;s Blessing.</span></p><p><span style="">She sat in the seat.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;You aren&#x2019;t using the power of the Colony. You are using the power of creation.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Well, this is a little bit different than that.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">The Achievement Store was similar to the Point Store, yet it was slightly different.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;...like a god.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Huh? To be precise, I&apos;m not creating anything. &#xA0;I&apos;m just purchasing it.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I&apos;ve also used the Point Store before.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;....&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Melody was well aware of the existence of the Point Store. &#xA0;She had lost the privilege, but she had once been a Dimensional lord.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;It is something very surprising. &#xA0;It is able to mimic god&apos;s miracle.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Is that so? &#xA0;Woojin had only thought about it as an Item Shop. &#xA0;However, such an obvious system was being called god&apos;s miracle by Melody.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;You planted a World Tree. &#xA0;You created the castle and homes. &#xA0;Then you created bread and food....&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;What are you trying to say?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin brows furrowed.</span></p><p><span style="">Melody had a cautious expression. &#xA0;She carefully asked her question.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I wonder if the Immortal is already a god?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;A god...&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin emptied a cup of water, and he bit into the bread.</span></p><p><span style="">Anything he bought from the Dimensional Store and Achievement Store was formed in reality. &#xA0;It could be seen as an act of creation. &#xA0;How should he resolve this misunderstanding? &#xA0;No. &#xA0;Was it really a misunderstanding?</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;What is your definition of a god?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;...&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">She was a Holy Maiden, who worshipped a goddess. &#xA0;Was this question too simple for her? &#xA0;Or was it too complex for her?</span></p><p><span style="">Melody couldn&apos;t easily answer the question, and the silence stretched on.</span></p><p><span style="">[There is a Dungeon to the north.]</span></p><p><span style="">Ggaebi had returned from his reconnaissance. &#xA0;Woojin got up when he heard Ggaebi&apos;s words.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Well, I&apos;m going to go clear out a Dungeon. &#xA0;You should wait here for a moment.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Yes.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin got on Shing Shing, and he disappeared into the distance. &#xA0;Melody sat for a long time as she struggled over her thoughts.</span></p><p><span style="">There was no easy answer to the question posed by Woojin. &#xA0;Her expression became complicated.</span></p><p><span style="">***</span></p><p><span style="">Colony City Yoros.</span></p><p><span style="">A drilling ground that doubled as a square was built at every key location. &#xA0;People were gathered in the square as they watched the fire.</span></p><p><span style="">The enormous flame alternated between expanding and shrinking. &#xA0;It was like a forge&apos;s fire being stoked by a a bellow.</span></p><p><span style="">Hwah-roo-roohk.</span></p><p><span style="">A person could be seen standing within the flame.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Whew. I&apos;m having a hard time getting this right.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Sunggoo tilted his head, and he once again created a flame.</span></p><p><span style="">Hwah-roo-roo-roohk!</span></p><p><span style="">It took less than 1 second for his body to burn. &#xA0;Sunggoo purposefully turned his body into fire. &#xA0;It looked as if Sunggoo&apos;s body was getting a bit larger. &#xA0;However, his body kept returning to his original size. &#xA0;He kept repeating this process.</span></p><p><span style="">People seemed to be entertained by the sight especially the children. &#xA0;Also, several people had their two hands clasped. &#xA0;It looked as if they were giving a prayer.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;What are you doing?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Do-jaemin had been passing by when he saw a praying girl, so he asked her a question. &#xA0;The surprised girl lowered her head.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Ah, Count Jaemin.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">He was a noble of the night. &#xA0;Do-jaemin had inherited the blood of a Count, and he was now a Vampire Lord. &#xA0;He was famous in the coalition for his considerable battle prowess.</span></p><p><span style="">Do-jaemin and Hong-sunggoo was known as the vassals of Immortal. &#xA0;Then there was Blanka, Che-haesol and the Phantom Unit. &#xA0;The people gazed at them with awe.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I&apos;m praying for a wish as I look at the elemental spirit.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;...elemental spirit?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Yes.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">The girl nodded her head as if it was obvious. &#xA0;He glanced at Hong-sunggoo.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Ah. &#xA0;Well...&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">In a certain way, he did look like an elemental spirit....</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I always though the Immortal as someone to be feared. &#xA0;However, it seems he is someone very extraordinary. &#xA0;He has the Fire Spirit King and the Count as vassals. &#xA0;All the people under him are powerful.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Yes. &#xA0;Well, that&apos;s...&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">They hadn&apos;t been strong from the beginning, but he didn&apos;t want to argue every one of her points. &#xA0;He just laughed. &#xA0;Now he had a good idea what the people on this planet thought of him.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Well, you should continue watching the sight.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Yes, Count.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Jaemin looked at Sunggoo in admiration. &#xA0;Sunggoo didn&apos;t care if people watched him or not. &#xA0;He was able to maintain his concentration.</span></p><p><span style="">&apos;I would be too embarrassed to do that.&apos;</span></p><p><span style="">Was it the case of his concentration being great? &#xA0;Or was he too oblivious of his surrounding?</span></p><p><span style="">Do-jaemin shook his head as he left his seat.</span></p><p><span style="">&apos;I wonder if Woojin-hyung got there safely.&apos;</span></p><p><span style="">He planned on legitimizing Melody by making her the official Holy Maiden of Aria, and he wanted her to receive her Holy Item. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">Basically, he wanted to take the Holy Item away from her, and it had been two days since he had headed towards Aria&apos;s Temple.</span></p><p><span style="">It was located in the middle of enemy territory, yet he felt relaxed since this was Woojiin he was talking about.</span></p><p><span style="">&apos;If we gain goddess Aria&apos;s Holy Item, then I guess we have only one left.&apos;</span></p><p><span style="">This was according to Woojin&apos;s words.</span></p><p><span style="">Once he obtained the god of time Heres&apos; Holy Item, Woojin would have obtained all the Items needed to make his Set.</span></p><p><span style="">Since the hint about destroying the Dungeons hinged on this Set, Jaemin wanted it to be found as soon as possible.</span></p><p><span style="">It wasn&apos;t too bad being dispatched to Alphen, but Jaemin was already homesick.</span></p><p><span style="">He wondered how Woojin-hyung was able to push away his loneliness for 20 years....</span></p>
