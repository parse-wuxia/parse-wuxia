Sunggoo&apos;s pouting lip was a foot long as he sulked.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hyung-nim.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Why don&apos;t you teach me any magic?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin smirked when he saw Sunggoo sulking.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;You didn&apos;t have to have the ability to be able to learn it.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;I don&apos;t mind attending hyung-nim for the rest of my life. I&apos;ll run small errands and excavate all the bloodstone.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;But?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Please teach me one Fire-type magic. You know about my dream.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Flame Magician.</span></p><p><span style="">When he had become a Roused, this had been his objective and greatest desire. He had learned several flame-based magic, but he hadn&apos;t learned anything that would be considered a high rank magic.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Can&apos;t you just buy a magic scroll and learn it yourself?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ah-ha!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Why didn&apos;t he ever think of that?</span></p><p><span style="">Sunggoo had become too used to doing everything with his body, so he had only done what he had been ordered to do. When Sungoo realized this, he was surprised, and depressed.</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin patted Sunggoo&apos;s shoulder.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hong-sunggoo. You are our director of miscellaneous work.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;Yes.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What do you think the role of director of miscellaneous work is?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">What else was it? He was basically an errand boy receiving a high salary.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I&apos;m in charge of the tedious chores.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Do you really think that?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Why do you think you are in charge of doing all the small tasks?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Well&#x2026; He was in charge of the miscellaneous works. Usually, the youngest in the company did those work.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;If I&apos;m absent from my seat, I need someone to fill my role. Who do you think will do that??&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;P...perhaps.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin looked Sunggoo straight in the face.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;You are our guild&apos;s #2.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;H...hyung-nim.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">He was unaware of this fact, and he had complained....</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I&apos;ve already acquired several magic for you, but you weren&apos;t able to learn it.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Currently, Sunggoo was level 61.</span></p><p><span style="">If Sunggoo had his energy checked right now, he would easily be able to get Rank A. This was the result of his training. He had diligently went around the Dungeons when Woojin had traveled to the US.</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin took 3 magic scrolls out of his Inventory.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Now you can learn it.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hyung-nim&#x2026;.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Sunggoo became teary-eyed as he looked at the magic scrolls.</span></p><p><span style="">Hyung-nim&apos;s thoughts were so deep, yet he had kept complaining....</span></p><p><span style="">Now it felt as if he had been committing a sin when he felt disappointed before..</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hyung-nim. Did you give me minor tasks so I can grow my versatility?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;No. Those were just minor tasks.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;&#x2026;.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Ah, the tears that were about to come out had dried up.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;You are number two&#x2026;. As for being versatile...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin grinned. What was the point of Sunggoo becoming versatile? If Woojin needed someone like that, he&apos;ll just grab someone who was capable in that facet.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;We have Minchan for that, so why would you want that role? You are number two.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin smiled as he looked at Sunggoo.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;You just have to be the strongest after me.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;&#x2026;.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I&apos;ll make you a human flame.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Oh oh!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Sunggoo couldn&apos;t hold himself back, so he let out an exclamation. He started learning the magic scroll that was handed over to him by Woojin.</span></p><p><span style="">*</span></p><p><span style="">Sunggoo learned the three magic and he was smiling from ear to ear.</span></p><p><span style="">Each of the magic scrolls given by Woojin produced incredible power.</span></p><p><span style="">After using it repeatedly, Sunggoo was able to use the magic proficiently.</span></p><p><span style="">Skill Tree.</span></p><p><span style="">To learn some of the high rank skills, he had been required to learn a couple low rank skills. The skill Sunggoo had learned before were the precursor to learning the high rank magic.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;All right. Let&apos;s try this out in a live battle!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes, hyung-nim.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Sunggoo put on a determined expression, as if he was confident.</span></p><p><span style="">He immediately used Iron Skin to harden his skin like steel. Then, he coated himself with a magical barrier. On top of this, he added the Acceleration magic and the Flame magic he had learned today.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Blaze!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Hwah-roo-roo-rook.</span></p><p><span style="">Sunggoo&apos;s body started to burn up.</span></p><p><span style="">Sunggoo started running in that state, and a trail of fire was left behind him.</span></p><p><span style="">Hwah-roo-roo-rook.</span></p><p><span style="">Every step caused flames to erupt, and while he was running through the forest, Sunggoo broke off a branch from a tree.</span></p><p><span style="">He had used the barrier magic countless of times, so he had attained mastery over it. He could even send text messages when it was activated. He covered the branch with the magical barrier to prevent it from burning, then applied another new Flame magic that he had learned on top of it.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Enchant Fire!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">When the &#x2018;Enchant Fire&#x2019; magic was added, the flames surged forward around the magical barrier to form a flame sword.</span></p><p><span style="">Hooooong, hooooong!</span></p><p><span style="">Everytime he swung his flame sword, the trees caught fire and the forest was set further ablaze. Every place he passed was set on fire. He rushed about furiously, and the monsters of the forest became agitated. They started to act out violently.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;President. I&apos;ve excavated all the bloodstones.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Koo-roo-roo-roong.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">It seemed her Intimacy with the saber-toothed tiger had risen already. Che-haesol approached Woojin on the back of the saber-toothed tiger. Her eyes turned round as she caught an occasional sight of Sunggoo.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;H...he really was a mage, Director Hong.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Koo-kook.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin laughed as he pointed at Honggoo, who was running buck wild.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;How is that a magician? He&apos;s just a warrior holding a flaming stick.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;&#x2026;.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">He proclaimed himself a magician...</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Just stay back a little bit. Even if he looks like that, a spark from him could kill you.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Haesol softly touched the neck of the sabre-toothed tiger she was riding.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Jackson. Let&apos;s go!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;You named him Jackson?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes. Our army based had a tomcat named Jackson. That name came to mind...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin shook his and then gestured for her to move back.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hey, Sunggoo! Now gather them!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes, hyung-nim!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">From afar, Sunggoo&apos;s voice was heard as an echo. Soon, the ground started to vibrate a little bit.</span></p><p><span style="">Ooh-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo.</span></p><p><span style="">After a moment, car-sized, monsters-like boars, tigers, and bears began to appear out of the burning forest. They were all chasing a single being.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Heh heh heh. I&apos;m coming towards you, hyung-nim. I&apos;m coming.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Sungoo, who was being chased by the wild animals, was running as he was emitting fire. The damage from the flame agitated the wild animals further, causing them to chase after Sunggoo.</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin grinned when he saw Sunggoo gathering all the monsters.</span></p><p><span style="">It was just as he planned.</span></p><p><span style="">It was inefficient for him to hunt the monsters by letting his Undead Army ransack the forest. The wild animals had outstanding instincts for monsters. There were a lot of monsters that would hide themselves when facing a strong organized force, and it took too long to chase after every single one of them.</span></p><p><span style="">He needed a good bait, and Sunggoo perfectly fit the bill.</span></p><p><span style="">Sunggoo ran as if he would overshoot Woojin, but he stopped on a dime besides Woojin.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Well done.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Heh heh.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Sunggoo had done a marvelous job in fulfilling his role. Woojin had hidden all of his Skeleton Magicians in the surrounding. All at once, the Skeleton Magicians showed themselves. Then, they started shooting their magic towards the gathered monsters.</span></p><p><span style="">When his EXP started to surge upward, Woojin let out a small smile.</span></p><p><span style="">He might be able to finish clearing the Dungeon faster than he anticipated.</span></p><p><span style="">*</span></p><p><span style="">Haemin had called him saying that they were almost at the office. Minchan nervously waited for them.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;I have to convince him no matter what.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">Mnchan had to convince him before Woojin did anything. Minchan kept repeating the words he had prepared in his head.</span></p><p><span style="">The door to the office was thrown open. Woojin entered. A tired Haesol and a giddy Sunggoo followed in after him.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Minchan. Come in for a moment.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">When Woojin entered the president&apos;s room, Haemin approached Minchan and whispered in his ear.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Reporters are camped out below the office, so the president isn&apos;t in a good mood right now.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Everything had been quiet for awhile, but this was a very big deal. The reporters were rushing in for the chance to get even one word from them.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ughh.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Minchan swallowed his moan as he opened the door to the president&apos;s room.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Sit.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Minchan sat across Woojin. He parked his butt on the sofa, then he surveyed Woojin&apos;s face. His brows were slightly furrowed, so it meant he wasn&apos;t in a particularly good mood.</span></p><p><span style="">He felt the inside of his head turn white.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What was up with the news?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Those are false reports. The footage had been filmed to be sent out after president made the final decision.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;So they just spread it on their own volition?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I think there was a mix-up with the press.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin grinned.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;They probably told them to make the mistake.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;&#x2026;.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Minchan had also thought on the same line, so he didn&apos;t have anything to say.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;The deal isn&apos;t bad. No, it is a really good deal. Currently, the government is doing everything to stop you from going to a foreign country. It seems several countries are putting some pressure on the Korean government.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The US was included in this group. Wasn&apos;t this the reason why the Korean government acted irrationally? They told everyone Kahng-woojin won&apos;t be leaving Korea, so they wanted everyone to stop fucking with them.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Minchan.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;The problem isn&apos;t whether the deal is good or bad.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Then what&#x2026;.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Did you forget why I made this guild?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;&#x2026;.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">He made it, since he didn&apos;t want to enter the army. It was a roundabout way to resolve his mandatory military service.</span></p><p><span style="">Minchan had an expression that said, &apos;So what?&apos;, so Woojin threw in an additional question.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Why did I make this guild and not go to the Hammer guild?.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;That is&#x2026;. Huk!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Michan&apos;s face became rigid.</span></p><p><span style="">Minchan had tried his best to scout Woojin to the Hammer guild, but he decided to make a new guild. Woojin had become independent, since he didn&apos;t want to work under someone.</span></p><p><span style="">So did this hold true for a country as well as a company?</span></p><p><span style="">Still, he had lived as a Korean citizen up until now, so why...</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;They are trying to put a collar around my neck, so why should I stay put?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Benefits were just sweet words. It was nothing more than that.</span></p><p><span style="">He didn&apos;t want to become a leashed dog even if they gave him tasty food.</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin&apos;s voice was calm, and that&apos;s what made it scary.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;P...please be patient.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin put on a bitter expression at Minchan&apos;s panic.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Please don&apos;t commit mutiny!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">If Woojin charged into the Cheongwadae, he would overturn the country. Minchan&apos;s face turned pale, and it wasn&apos;t without reasons.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What? Do you think I&apos;m that unreasonable?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;&#x2026;.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">He couldn&apos;t say no to that question.</span></p><p><span style="">When Minchan was hesitating to answer him, Woojin leaned back to bury his body into the sofa.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;&#x2026;.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Let&apos;s give back as much as we&apos;ve received.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;How&#x2026;?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Call in all the reporters camping outside.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;&#x2026;.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">This was trouble.</span></p><p><span style="">Minchan didn&apos;t have the time to stop Woojin, who was about to create a big issue once again. He had no idea what the result of this situation would be, so Minchan became gloomy at the prospect of doing the damage-control.</span></p><p><span style="">*</span></p><p><span style="">The reporters rushed into Alandal&apos;s office, which had been shrouded in secret thus far. As if they would find a scandal at every corner of the office, the reporters tirelessly pressed the shutters of their cameras.</span></p><p><span style="">Each media company were limited to two reporters, and all the reporters gathered to for the simple press conference.</span></p><p><span style="">The reporters caught a special opportunity, so they had an excited expression on their faces. They opened their laptops, and notebooks.</span></p><p><span style="">Several dozen recording devices were placed on top of the desk.</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin stepped forward with a single piece of paper in hand, and he sat behind the desk that had been prepared.</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin frowned when he looked at the paper, which held the statement written by Minchan.</span></p><p><span style="">[First, there were false reports sent out by the media. The guardian guild negotiation hasn&apos;t been resolved yet. I am very sorry to say...]</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin crumpled the paper, then he looked at the seats crowded with reporters. When their eyes met, several reporters raised their hand. Woojin laughed as he started to speak.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Well, I&apos;ll answer your questions later. As Alandal&apos;s president, I&apos;m here to reveal my position.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The reporters stopped breathing as they strained their ears to listen to Woojin&apos;s words.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I believe the government was in league with the media companies, and they leaked a deal that hadn&apos;t been finalized.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Someone said, &apos;This is a scoop!&apos;, in a small voice then the sound of rapid typing could be heard.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;The way they act really stinks. I don&apos;t feel good about this. Please tell them I won&apos;t renegotiate with them. Please tell them not to even try to contact me.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Huk.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Several reporters let out the breath they had been holding, then they started writing the official stance of Alandal.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;They are overly worried about me leaving. If they pull anything behind my back again, then tell them I&apos;ll be leaving immediately. The end.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">How many men could boldly threaten a government?</span></p><p><span style="">When one reporter quickly raised his hand, Woojin pointed at him.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;We know you&apos;ve received offers from multiple countries. Are you thinking about immigrating now?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin shrugged his shoulder.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I&apos;m not going to any country that&apos;ll annoy me. Then that&apos;ll be the end of me answering questions.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin turned his head to look at Jung-minchan.</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin laughed as he looked at Minchan, who had a &apos;We are doomed&apos; expression on his face. He should have just obediently come back after eating dinner. He did such unnecessary things...</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Please ask any questions you have left to our vice president.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;W...wait a moment..&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Even at the reporter&apos;s entreaty, Woojin left his seat. So the reporters turned their gazes towards Minchan.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I have a question for the vice president.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I&apos;m JS Media&apos;s Kim-shingyoung. Alandal&apos;s future....&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Previously, they were intimidated by Woojin, so only a few brave souls barely raised their hands. Now the reporters started throwing out questions without permission, and Minchan was already sick of the reporters.</span></p><p><span style="">Minchan&apos;s gaze settled on Woojin&apos;s back as he was leaving the room.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;He&apos;s fighting media manipulation with media manipulation.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">This was rather a relief. If he had rushed the Cheongwadae instead... It was too horrifying to think such thoughts.</span></p><p></p></div><p></p>
