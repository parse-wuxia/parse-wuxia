<p>Chapter 183 - Descendant of a Dragon (1)</p><p><span style="">It was hot.</span></p><p><span style="">After he started working with fire, he had thought he had forgotten such sensation.</span></p><p><span style="">However, the heat he felt through his two hands couldn&apos;t be described as fire. &#xA0;He was someone, who had digested the conflagration from hell.</span></p><p><span style="">He couldn&apos;t lose to a mere Dragon&apos;s Breath.</span></p><p><span style="">A Red Dragon&apos;s Breath was made out of fire, so he&apos;ll be able to absorb it.</span></p><p><span style="">&apos;I&apos;m melting.&apos;</span></p><p><span style="">His two hands were disintegrating into a haze. &#xA0;When he saw this sight, the confidence that had been creeping into his head disappeared. &#xA0;His confidence hit rock-bottom. </span></p><p><span style="">&apos;I...I&apos;m dying.&apos;</span></p><p><span style="">The moment he felt fear he could no longer resist against the Breath&apos;s nature.</span></p><p><span style="">Hwah-ah-ahk!</span></p><p><span style="">The flames were consuming him, and it felt as if his hands, feet and hair would all burn away. &#xA0;No, it might have already happened.</span></p><p><span style="">The only thing his two eye could see was the red flames...</span></p><p><span style="">&apos;Ah ah...&apos;</span></p><p><span style="">The flames was so strong that it felt as if his soul was burning away. &#xA0;There was no way he would be able to gather his disordered mind.</span></p><p><span style="">The faint memories and past life events were passing in front of his eyes when he heard a voice.</span></p><p><span style="">&apos;Sunggoo.&apos;</span></p><p><span style="">It was a familiar voice.</span></p><p><span style="">Was it his parent&apos;s voice? &#xA0;Was it the voice of an angel?</span></p><p><span style="">&apos;Hey Sunggoo!&apos;</span></p><p><span style="">He didn&apos;t know if he was hearing through his ears, or maybe it was a hallucination ringing inside his mind.</span></p><p><span style="">His consciousness was fading away, and in the end, Sunggoo blacked out.</span></p><p><span style="">***</span></p><p><span style="">Hoo-ooh-oohk.</span></p><p><span style="">The burning heat was spreading to the surrounding. &#xA0;The air was so hot that most people couldn&apos;t get closer to the source.</span></p><p><span style="">[Move!]</span></p><p><span style="">Lich Jaenis formed nested barriers as he blocked the Dragon&apos;s Breath.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Sunggo!&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin had arrived in great haste, and he saw the mushy body of Sunggoo, which was melting away.</span></p><p><span style="">The bastard was dumb yet sweet. &#xA0;Sunggoo was someone, who followed his order at all cost... &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">Why did he have to do such a reckless act?</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin&apos;s gaze headed towards the World Tree, which was rustling from the wind. &#xA0;He saw the Portals in front of it, and the light looked especially profound and mysterious today.</span></p><p><span style="">The Colony had been safeguarded.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Hey Sunggoo.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;....&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">There was no reply as Sunggoo&#x2019;s soul shook as if it was miserable.</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin cooled his heart. &#xA0;He had worried for the past 20 years about dying on Alphen without being able to return to earth. &#xA0;These memories flitted through his head.</span></p><p><span style="">The first person from earth to die on Alphen shouldn&apos;t be Sunggoo. &#xA0;There was no way he would let that happen.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Don&apos;t worry.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin sat near the fire. &#xA0;His hand headed towards the body, which seemed to be melting away as it tried to reconcile with the flame.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I want you to command all my Familiars, Jaenis.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">[Lord&#x2026; &#xA0;What do you want me to do?]</span></p><p><span style="">The Lich&apos;s body was currently existed as a flame. &#xA0;It brushed by Sunggo, and it came to rest next to its master. &#xA0;Usually his voice was filled with playfulness, but it no longer had that tone.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I want you to eradicate all the Dimensional lords and monsters on Alphen.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">[As the lord wishes...]</span></p><p><span style="">Jaenis turned away.</span></p><p><span style="">As he headed towards the outer walls, his robes trembled from pure bliss.</span></p><p><span style="">He&apos;ll finally be able to save Alphen.</span></p><p><span style="">He&apos;ll also relieve the lives of the beings that stood against the Immortal....</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;H..hyung....&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Jaemin approached them with a face full of worry. &#xA0;Woojin was terse with his words.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I&apos;ll save Sunggoo. &#xA0;You should return to earth first.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;How can I be the only one to...&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;If this place is any indication, earth probably isn&apos;t in a great state either. &#xA0;Go and protect them.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Y...you want me to protect them?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Do-jaemin was taken aback. &#xA0;He had received the Vampire Lord&apos;s blood, but he wasn&apos;t at Kahng-woojin&apos;s level.</span></p><p><span style="">He didn&apos;t have the power or the guts to protect earth. &#xA0;Woojin looked at him with earnest eyes.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Sooah&#x2026; &#xA0;No matter what, you have to protect Sooah.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;...yes.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I&apos;ll be there soon. &#xA0;Please just hold out until then.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Yes, hyung.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Do-jaemin quickly headed towards the Portal. &#xA0;When Woojin gave his approval, Jaemin&apos;s body was sent across the portal. &#xA0;He was sent to Bibi&apos;s Castle. &#xA0;He was sent to the aircraft carrier being governed by Bibi. </span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Hoo...&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin wanted to go to earth immediately to see what the Dimensional lords were up to. &#xA0;However, he couldn&apos;t.</span></p><p><span style="">Hwah-roo-roohk.</span></p><p><span style="">The flame still refused to die down as it enveloped Sunggoo&apos;s body. &#xA0;If one called him a Fire Spirit, he fit the description now.</span></p><p><span style="">His entire body had melted away... &#xA0;His soul was just boiling like a ball of flame.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Don&apos;t die.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">If he couldn&apos;t even save a single person, how could he claim that he will save earth?</span></p><p><span style="">Hwee-ahhhng.</span></p><p><span style="">The evil spirits, which circled around Woojin&apos;s body, started to crawl forward.</span></p><p><span style="">Shwahhhng.</span></p><p><span style="">The black evil spirits circled around Sunggoo as they restricted the movement of Sunggoo&apos;s soul. &#xA0;It was as if they were trying to prevent Sunggoo&apos;s soul from escaping.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;....&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin spread out his two hands, and he didn&apos;t move an inch as if he was frozen in place. &#xA0;He concentrated then he concentrated again. &#xA0;He was making sure the evil spirits couldn&apos;t harm Sunggoo&apos;s soul.</span></p><p><span style="">Shwahhhng.</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin was tethering Sunggoo, who wasn&apos;t ready to depart from this world. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">This was when the Gold Dragon Fatooh let out a roar.</span></p><p><span style="">[Koo-oh-oh-oh!]</span></p><p><span style="">Red Dragon Leia had died by the Immortal&apos;s attack. &#xA0;The raging Fatooh landed on the outer wall as it let out a roar. &#xA0;Its influence was immediate. &#xA0;The monsters, who had been milling about in confusion, stopped for a brief moment before they started gathering around the Dragon.</span></p><p><span style="">It seemed the Dragon wanted to continue the siege. &#xA0;It wanted to continue until the World Tree was destroyed.</span></p><p><span style="">[A mere Dragon dares to bark in front of the king!]</span></p><p><span style="">Jaenis walked forward.</span></p><p><span style="">He was letting out a black energy, and his unfiltered murderous intent was rushing out of him. &#xA0;As Jaenis continued forward, the heroes of the Coalition was busy retreating from fright.</span></p><p><span style="">Shwahhk.</span></p><p><span style="">Black smoke were coalescing one by one behind the Lich as the Death Knights were summoned.</span></p><p><span style="">[Our lord has given us an order.]</span></p><p><span style="">Ramson accepted Jaenis&apos; words.</span></p><p><span style="">[Ah. &#xA0;Did everyone hear that?]</span></p><p><span style="">[Is that Yong Yong?]</span></p><p><span style="">[We&apos;ll be able to fight to our heart&apos;s content.]</span></p><p><span style="">Each of the Death Knights said what they wanted to before they summoned their Skeleton Warriors. &#xA0;Hundreds of thousands of Skeletons ripped themselves out of the black abyss.</span></p><p><span style="">[We&apos;ll have to kill the Dragon first.]</span></p><p><span style="">Shwahhhh.</span></p><p><span style="">From behind the Lich, several thousand Skeleton Magicians appeared. &#xA0;These were the magician troops under his direct command.</span></p><p><span style="">Shwahng!</span></p><p><span style="">Various types of magical spells were shot out at once towards the Gold Dragon Fatooh.</span></p><p><span style="">Puh-puh-puhng!</span></p><p><span style="">The Dragon had its Shield magic engaged, so these attacks couldn&apos;t hurt it. &#xA0;However, the nearby monsters were hit, and they struggled in pain.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I won&apos;t forgive you, Immortal!&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Tens or hundreds...</span></p><p><span style="">Not much significance was placed on the number of deaths suffered by the Dimensional lords, who lived for a very long time....</span></p><p><span style="">Leia and Fatooh.</span></p><p><span style="">However, it meant a lot for these two beings. &#xA0;Weak beings died in the tens or hundreds of times, but they were Dragons before they became Dimensional lords. &#xA0;There were only a handful of times where they had experienced death. &#xA0;Of course, Fatooh was pissed.</span></p><p><span style="">Weeeeng.</span></p><p><span style="">Fatooh&apos;s stomach became engorged as it took a deep breath. &#xA0;It wanted to decimate all the Skeletons with its Breath.</span></p><p><span style="">The enraged Dragon&apos;s mouth was about to head towards the Saurus mountain&apos;s peak when the ground shook. &#xA0;A big body was running up the mountain.</span></p><p><span style="">[It&apos;s someone from my race!]</span></p><p><span style="">Yong Yong smashed through the forest as it jumped on Fatooh&apos;s back before it could let out its Breath. &#xA0;It looked skinny, but Yong Yong wasn&apos;t light at all. &#xA0;Its hook-like feet pressed Fatooh&apos;s head into the ground.</span></p><p><span style="">[Goo-roo-roo.... &#xA0;What is your wish?]</span></p><p><span style="">This was probably how a prey felt before being eaten by a predator... &#xA0;The two beings matched eyes.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Ancient...&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">[Your wish?]</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Get off....&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Kwah-jeek!</span></p><p><span style="">Fatooh&apos;s head was crushed when Yong Yong&apos;s claws were clenched. </span></p><p><span style="">Ggooh-ahng!</span></p><p><span style="">The Breath and magical energy were mixed within the body, and it exploded forth as if a dam had broken. &#xA0;However, even if this maelstrom occurred beneath Yong Yong, it only briefly lifted Yong Yong&apos;s body into the air.</span></p><p><span style="">After the Bone Dragon landed on the decimated land, it looked at the numerous monsters in its surrounding.</span></p><p><span style="">[Your wish has been granted.]</span></p><p><span style="">If they wished death, he&apos;ll grant it.</span></p><p><span style="">[Goo-oh-oh-oh!]</span></p><p><span style="">At Yong Yong&apos;s roar, the monsters started to run away in fright.</span></p><p><span style="">[It&apos;s a hunt!]</span></p><p><span style="">The Death Knights summoned their Phantom Steeds, and they swept over the battlefield.</span></p><p><span style="">***</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;It has come to an end.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Someone had mumbled out those words, and it acted like a signal. &#xA0;The nervousness that was suffocating them was washed away.</span></p><p><span style="">The monsters were running away... &#xA0;Their roars were moving farther away. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">Then there were their injured comrades...</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Let us sweep the battlefield! &#xA0;Please gather the injured!&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Skia&apos;s first monk Tauric yelled out the instructions. &#xA0;Several people came to their senses, and they started gathering their injured comrades, who were moaning in pain.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;....in the end, we were able to protect this place.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Elf Lord &apos;Silver Arrow&apos; Latasha was already next to Tauric as she spoke. &#xA0;He let out a sigh.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;He protected it.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Immortal had arrived right on time. &#xA0;No, he might have been late, but in the end, he was able to protect this place.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;The Fire Spirit King... &#xA0;Will he live?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I&apos;m not sure.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin was sitting in front of the World Tree as if he was meditating, and there was a flickering flame in front of him. &#xA0;The size of the flame was getting smaller, and it seemed to portend the death of the Fire Spirit. &#xA0;It was regretful.</span></p><p><span style="">&apos;He might already be dead...&apos;</span></p><p><span style="">The Immortal was trying his best to save the Fire Spirit. &#xA0;The Immortal&apos;s expression was so serious that she couldn&apos;t express such sentiments.</span></p><p><span style="">Latasha looked around her surrounding, and she tilted her head in puzzlement.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Did the Holy Maiden not come back yet?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;That&apos;s....&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Tauric swallowed his words.</span></p><p><span style="">Melody had left with Woojin, yet he had returned by himself. &#xA0;It wasn&#x2019;t as if he could ask the Immortal about &#xA0;her....</span></p><p><span style="">He was between a rock and a hard place, so he decided to wait for the Immortal to finish his work.</span></p><p><span style="">***</span></p><p><span style="">&apos;It isn&apos;t time.&apos;</span></p><p><span style="">&apos;He is calling for you.&apos;</span></p><p><span style="">&apos;Be strong.&apos;</span></p><p><span style="">The sound tickled his ears, so Sunggoo opened his eyes.</span></p><p><span style="">No, he couldn&apos;t tell if his eyelids were open or not.</span></p><p><span style="">The only certain part was the fact that his consciousness was awake.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;You are awake?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">[H...hyung.]</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Yes. &#xA0;It&apos;s all right.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Sunggoo tried to get up.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Uh uh. &#xA0;You should stay still. &#xA0;Just look straight up.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin quickly gave instructions, and Sunggoo just looked upwards towards Woojin&#x2019;s face. &#xA0;He could tell that Woojin was genuinely worried for him.</span></p><p><span style="">[Hyung. &#xA0;Am I still alive?]</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;You are for now. &#xA0;However, you are slowly dying.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">[....]</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;First, let me put an insurance in place.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">While Sunggoo was conscious, Woojin quickly made him a vassal of his Dimensional Domain.</span></p><p><span style="">Sunggoo would be the second vassal from earth after Do-jaemin.</span></p><p><span style="">&lt;Hong-sunggoo was appointed as a knight of Alandal.&gt;</span></p><p><span style="">[I became a knight?]</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Yes. &#xA0;Still, you should avoid dying at all cost.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">It was as he implied. &#xA0;This was just insurance. &#xA0;If things went wrong, Sunggoo could be revived using Points, since he was a vassal of Woojin&apos;s Domain.</span></p><p><span style="">However, it wasn&apos;t a guarantee that Sunggoo would come back as his old self. &#xA0;Moreover, when he died, Sunggoo would lose his inherent ID Code.</span></p><p><span style="">When he was born, he was given an ID Code for earth.</span></p><p><span style="">This was what allowed him to immediately re-enter earth. &#xA0;He didn&apos;t have to wait for the Synchronization.</span></p><p><span style="">If he lost his Code, he&apos;ll basically be in the same category as the aliens and monsters.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I&apos;ll save you. &#xA0;You have two choices.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">[What is it?]</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Before you soul is destroyed, I can revive you as a Lich.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Why was hyung-him speaking those words with such a serious expression on his face?</span></p><p><span style="">[.....do I have another choice?]</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;You can overcome it. &#xA0;Your body can fight and win against Dragon&apos;s Breath and the curse left behind by the Dragon Language.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">[Isn&apos;t that the better choice?]</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;However, it&apos;ll be painful. &#xA0;It&apos;ll be very painful, and there is a very low chance of it succeeding.</span></p><p><span style="">[....]</span></p><p><span style="">What kind of choices were those? </span></p><p><span style="">Why did his life always drive him into a spot where he had to make such difficult decisions?</span></p><p><span style="">[Hyung. &#xA0;I&apos;ve never been in a romantic relationship...]</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Mmm.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin, who had a very serious expression on his face up until now, smiled for the first time. &#xA0;Since he had the time to crack a joke, it seemed Sunggoo had found his equilibrium. &#xA0;He was joking around even as his corpse was being destroyed.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;If you become a Lich, you won&apos;t lose your Code. &#xA0;That is the safer...&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">[No way.]</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;....&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">[I&apos;ll do it. &#xA0;I&apos;ll overcome it]</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;....&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">[I&#x2019;ll only die after I experience being in a romantic relationship. &#xA0;How will I accomplish that if I&apos;m revived as a Skeleton?]</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;....&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin&apos;s expression hardened.</span></p><p><span style="">Sunggoo&#x2026; &#xA0;He hadn&apos;t been joking.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;All right.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin took out the Dragon&apos;s Heart from his Inventory. &#xA0;It was a treasure he had been lucky to acquire at Mivich&apos;s Laboratory.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;It is only a Dragon&apos;s Curse. &#xA0;You will overcome it.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">He&apos;ll overcome the lizard&apos;s curse.</span></p><p><span style="">[Yes.]</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin placed the Dragon&apos;s Heart on top of Sunggoo&apos;s soul.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;You&apos;ll be able to do it.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">No, he had to do it.</span></p><p><span style="">If he wanted avoid becoming a pitiful Dimensional refugee looking for one&apos;s home planet Code, he&apos;ll have to do it.</span></p><p><span style="">He&apos;ll overcome the Dragon&apos;s Curse even if he had to become a Draconian...</span></p>
