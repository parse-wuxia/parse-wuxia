<p>Chapter 205 - Recover (1)</p><p><span style=""> &quot;Where is he?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">When the spacecraft&apos;s hatch closed, Dr. Toppler took off his helmet, and he was the first to speak.</span></p><p><span style="">Captain Leone had a bitter expression on his face as he looked at the anxious professor.</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;He&#x2019;s in the recovery room.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Dr. Toppler was able to read many things from his expression, so he opened the door to the recovery room with a gloomy heart.</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;P...professor.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Dr. Toppler looked the same except he was a bit older. &#xA0;It seemed Kim-kahngchul was deeply moved by this fact.</span></p><p><span style="">He really had opened his eyes in the real world.</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;What happened to Earth&#x2019;s Code?&quot;</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;...I failed.&quot;</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;Ha-ah.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Dr. Toppler let out a long sigh.</span></p><p><span style="">So what was the point in awakening Kahng-woojin, who only had the Recovery Code? &#xA0;If they wanted a Rollback, they needed a reference point in the form of the Planet Code.</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;Is there really a need to do a Rollback, professor?&quot;</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;What?&quot;</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;Can&#x2019;t you just save everyone just like me?&quot;</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;Ha-ah.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">At Kim-kahngchul&#x2019;s words, Toppler shook his head from side to side as he let out a sigh. &#xA0;Their resources were already depleted, and the presence of any life was absent in their home. &#xA0;In such a situation, what would happen if tens of thousands of people were to awaken at the same time?</span></p><p><span style="">Even without an external cause, the people would self-destruct.</span></p><p><span style="">It was inside the VR world, but humans fought each other for power through an endless war. &#xA0;It was human nature.</span></p><p><span style="">Kim-kahngchul&#x2019;s expression still indicated that he didn&#x2019;t comprehend the reasoning behind the Rollback.</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;Ha-ah. &#xA0;Once we reach our base on the moon, you&#x2019;ll be educated at the Readjustment Center...&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Dr. Toppler stopped speaking as he looked at the time displayed on the wall.</span></p><p><span style="">Why did everything get so twisted?</span></p><p><span style="">Should he have followed the advice of the &#xA0;Council? &#xA0;Should he have made more preparations by running more tests?</span></p><p><span style="">His meeting with Kahng-woojin was a small event, yet it had a butterfly effect. &#xA0;&#xA0;Now events had spiraled out of control.</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;Please listen to me carefully.&quot;</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;Yes, professor.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Kim-kahngchul listened to Dr. Toppler&#x2019;s words as if it was gospel. &#xA0;He was reverent as if he was in the presence of a god.</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;When one connects to the Virtual World, an avatar is created. &#xA0;We call this the Login.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Kim-kahngchul was already aware of this fact. &#xA0;He didn&#x2019;t even think of VR earth as being real. &#xA0;He found it easier to think of it as a game. &#xA0;No, he was living proof of this fact.</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;I was finally able to log out.&quot;</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;Exactly.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Kim-kahngchul thought of it as escaping the virtual world, yet it wasn&#x2019;t as if the real world was a good place to live.</span></p><p><span style="">One had to always struggle for survival in this place. &#xA0;It was a world that might be relying on a &#xA0;hope that might have already flown the coop.</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;Just be open to this possibility. &#xA0;What would happen if the beings in the Virtual Reality was logged out into this world?&quot;</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;What?&quot;</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;It is as I said. &#xA0;I&#x2019;m not talking about logging out a person that was logged in. &#xA0;What if the stuff in the virtual reality could appear in reality.&quot;</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;That is......&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Why was virtual reality called virtual?</span></p><p><span style="">It was a non-tangible abstraction of a physical object. &#xA0;The world existed only in the simulated space.</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;We are able to login to their reality. &#xA0;What if they could login to ours?&quot;</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;.......&quot;</span></p><p><span style=""> This was beyond Kim-kahngchul&#x2019;s wildest dreams.</span></p><p><span style="">If a person of the VR world could login to reality, what should it be called? &#xA0;Was it an act of creation from nothingness? &#xA0;Was it a descent into this world?</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;It will be the same as how we can go to the VR Earth. &#xA0;We&#x2019;ll be able to bring the beings in the VR to this place.&quot;</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;If that is possible&#x2026;.&quot;</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;We are trying to bring the VR Earth to this solar system. &#xA0;That VR Earth will become the new earth.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">The real earth had used up all its resources, and it was in ruins. &#xA0;This was a last ditch attempt at saving the population of earth.</span></p><p><span style="">It was terraforming through Virtual Reality.</span></p><p><span style="">An enormous amount of time had passed to make this into reality. </span></p><p><span style="">&quot;So what will happen to this earth?&quot;</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;It&#x2019;ll stay the same.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Earth wasn&#x2019;t the target of the terraforming. &#xA0;Earth was an ark that&#x2019;ll store the sleeping population until it was possible to move into the new earth.</span></p><p><span style=""> &#x201C;Mars will be terraformed.&quot;</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;Huh.... &#xA0;If that is possible then....&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Humanity would gain a new earth, and when they escape the VR World, they&#x2019;ll be able to live new lives. &#xA0;They&#x2019;ll be able to live on the new earth.</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;This is why we need a Reset.&quot;</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;......?&quot;</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;What&#x2019;s the point in bringing out an earth that is almost at the brink of ruin?&quot;</span></p><p><span style=""> The outbreak of Dungeons&#x2026;.</span></p><p><span style=""> The war had worsened, and the VR Earth was being destroyed in many locations.</span></p><p><span style=""> This was why they needed a Reset.</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;...I see.&quot;</span></p><p><span style=""> His voice sounded deflated.</span></p><p><span style=""> Now he knew why his life had been repeating. &#xA0;Instead of feeling relieved at finding out the reason, the feeling of emptiness grew within.</span></p><p><span style="">He had achieved his goals in opening his eyes in the real world, but the real world was in ruins. &#xA0;Moreover,everyone here had put all their eggs in the basket of the VR World.</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;If the 72 Thrones are able to completely take over the worlds of Trahnet, we&#x2019;ll no longer be able to login. &#xA0;Our last hope is the terraforming, yet everything might end before we can attempt it.&quot;</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;Aren&#x2019;t they also humans?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">They were supposedly humans sleeping and interfacing with the VR Worlds&#x2026;. &#xA0;If everything within was created by humans connected to the Trahnet, he was having a hard time comprehending the situation.</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;Professor. &#xA0;Captain Leone is paging you. &#xA0;The Neutralization Equipment is ready to be used again.&quot;</span></p><p><span style=""> When he heard the voice spoken from outside the door, Dr. Toppler patted Kim-kahngchul&#x2019;s shoulder.</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;Trahnet might not have been created by humans.&quot;</span></p><p><span style=""> The VR space was created as a byproduct. &#xA0;They had been researching the possibility of instantaneous travel between earth and mars. &#xA0;Maybe, humanity coincidentally stumbled onto Trahnet by chance.</span></p><p><span style="">This might not be a fight between humans. &#xA0;They might be fighting for survival against some alien entity. &#xA0;It was time for him to go retrieve the only key that&#x2019;ll allow them to reset the board.</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;Please rest.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Kim-kahngchul&#x2019;s role was done.</span></p><p><span style="">He&#x2019;ll have to search for a new candidate, who&#x2019;ll follow his instructions on Resetting earth. &#xA0;This person would have to be receptive to receiving a message from the Moon World.</span></p><p><span style="">***</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;The Neutralization equipment has been activated.&quot;</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;All right. &#xA0;Let&#x2019;s head in.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">At captain Leone&#x2019;s order, the party members hurriedly went into the subway station. &#xA0;This place had acted as a great bunker. &#xA0;It kept the people sheltered from the repeated wars and the resource depletion.</span></p><p><span style="">They relied on the flashlight to traverse the dark path, and they quickly arrived at Kahng-woojin&#x2019;s capsule.</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;Ready the cutter!&quot;</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;Yes, sir.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">They weren&#x2019;t going to do this with hands. &#xA0;They planned on ripping out the capsule, so they brought an enormous machine cutter.</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;Open the hatch!&quot;</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;Yes, sir.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">The party members opened the poorly closed capsule again.</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;Huhk.&quot;</span></p><p><span style=""> The party members became surprised when they looked into the open hatch.</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;He&#x2019;s not there.&quot;</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;What?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Captain Leone came closers, and he could see that the capsule was empty.</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;W...where the hell&#x2026;.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Where did he go?</span></p><p><span style="">This had never happened before.</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;What should we do, captain?&quot;</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;Eeek.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Captain Leone gritted his teeth. &#xA0;He was also confused, so his thoughts became complicated.</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;Find him. &#xA0;Do a thorough search of the surrounding.&quot;</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;Yes, sir!&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">The party members quickly turned on the portable lights, and they searched the surrounding region.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Maybe....&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Leone was mesmerized as he stared at the empty capsule. &#xA0;No one had been able to wake up through one&#x2019;s own efforts. &#xA0;No one had been able to do it, since humanity was connected to Trahnet&#x2026;.</span></p><p><span style="">***</span></p><p><span style="">Ggee-eek.</span></p><p><span style="">Dr. Toppler opened the broken door. &#xA0;He looked around his surrounding. &#xA0;&#xA0;It seemed there had been a battle inside the isolation room. &#xA0;It was a mess.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018; Hoo-ooh&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">It was all up to him now. &#xA0;While captain Leone acquires the Recovery Code, he had to quickly acquire the Earth&#x2019;s Master Code.</span></p><p><span style="">He froze when he exited the isolation room.</span></p><p><span style="">Members of the Phantom Unit was on guard duty, and their gazes landed on him.</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;Who are you?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">He would have felt better if a gun was pointed at him. &#xA0;As they asked the question, they moved to either side of Toppler, and they grabbed him.</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;Ooh-ook.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">He was roughly thrown to the floor. &#xA0;Then his hands and feet were cuffed. &#xA0;As if this wasn&#x2019;t enough, a Roused with a Binding skill used his ability.</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;Huh-ooh.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">It felt as if the strength in his body had been drained away. &#xA0;He lay on the floor as he looked at the members of the Phantom Unit.</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;So who is he?&quot;</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;I have no idea. &#xA0;Go get the vice-commander.&quot;</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;Yes, sir.&quot;</span></p><p><span style=""> The fact that this man had popped out of the previously empty isolation room was suspicious.</span></p><p><span style="">Blanka&#x2019;s eyes turned round when he saw the captured Dr. Toppler.</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;Dr. Toppler!&quot;</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;.......&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Dr. Toppler was drained of energy, so his tongue felt like a leaden weight. &#xA0;He let out a weak laugh. &#xA0;No, he tried to laugh, but his face wouldn&#x2019;t move.</span></p><p><span style="">Most of the Phantom Unit was Rank A. &#xA0;Several of them had already reached Rank S. &#xA0;This wasn&#x2019;t a simple Binding skill.</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;Why are you here?&quot;</span></p><p><span style=""> At Blanka&#x2019;s question, a member of the Phantom Unit unfroze Dr. Toppler&#x2019;s face. &#xA0;Dr. Toppler tried moving his stiff tongue, and he was barely able to speak.</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;I&#x2019;m here to save earth.&quot;</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;Hmmm. &#xA0;Then why are you sneaking around in secret?&quot;</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;I&#x2019;m not sneaking around....&quot;</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;I know about you. &#xA0;You&#x2019;ll disappear if there is a door.&quot;</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;.......&quot;</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;We&#x2019;ll wait until the king returns.&quot;</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;Where&#x2019;s Kahng-woojin?&quot;</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;The king went to Moon World. &#xA0;You&#x2019;ll stay here until he comes back.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">There wasn&#x2019;t enough information to predict Dr. Toppler&#x2019;s behavior pattern, but there was one thing they were sure of. &#xA0;He was able to create Dungeons using doors, and he could disappear using this method.</span></p><p><span style="">Blanka pointed towards a long antenna on the other side of the control tower. &#xA0;If he was tethered there, he won&#x2019;t be able to run away easily.</span></p><p><span style="">It was the ideal place to hold Dr. Toppler.</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;You guys keep an eye on him.&quot;</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;Yes, vice-commander.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">The members of the Phantom Unit dragged Dr. Toppler to the antenna, and they started tying him up.</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;We don&#x2019;t have time for this. &#xA0;We have to save earth immediately.&quot;</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;You don&#x2019;t have to save it. &#xA0;We&#x2019;ll protect it.&quot;</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;......&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Blanka made a gesture with his eyes, and his subordinate froze Dr. Toppler again.</span></p><p><span style=""> &apos;Jeez. &#xA0;What the hell is this?&apos;</span></p><p><span style="">He couldn&#x2019;t believe what was going on.</span></p><p><span style="">He could do a force logout. &#xA0;However, if he did that, he wouldn&#x2019;t be able to get Earth&#x2019;s Code&#x2026;.</span></p><p><span style="">Dr. Toppler was tethered to the antenna, and he could see the horizon in the distance.</span></p><p><span style="">He was too far away, so it looked like a dot in the sky. &#xA0;However, &#xA0;Toppler could feel his presence.</span></p><p><span style=""> &apos;Absolute being....&apos;</span></p><p><span style=""> The being that wanted to dominate Trahnet.</span></p><p><span style="">That being had revived.</span></p><p><span style="">If he acquired the Earth&#x2019;s Code, everything would end. &#xA0;He had to Reset everything before that happened, yet he was tied up here&#x2026;..</span></p><p><span style="">***</span></p><p><span style="">A ball of flame landed on top of the Flying Fortress&#x2019; deck.</span></p><p><span style="">Hwah-roo-roohk.</span></p><p><span style="">It was a human, who had turned into fire itself.</span></p><p><span style="">Hong-sunggoo opened his mouth.</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;This might be more dangerous than I thought. &#xA0;He received damage, but everything gets absorbed.&quot;</span></p><p><span style=""> [Tell me in more details.]</span></p><p><span style=""> His old pupil.... &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">Jaenis looked at Sunggoo, who had become a Dragonoid. &#xA0;Jaenis spoke again.</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;Mmm. &#xA0;It takes damage, but if the attack doesn&#x2019;t pass a certain threshold, it recovers instantly.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Minchan, who had been listening to the exchange, asked in a serious manner.</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;Do we have any chance of defeating it?&quot;</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;Unfortunately, my attacks can&#x2019;t get over that threshold.&quot;</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;We&#x2019;ll have to fight it to figure this out.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Che-haesol spoke confidently, so a small hope appeared on his face.</span></p><p><span style=""> [We have to follow the lord&#x2019;s command]</span></p><p><span style="">Minchan agreed with the cold voice of Jaenis.</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;Let&#x2019;s run away. &#xA0;If the possibility of us winning is low, we should preserve our forces.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">They had to protect Sooah. &#xA0;This was the command given by Woojin.</span></p><p><span style="">Everyone differed in opinion, so in the end, they couldn&#x2019;t come to a decision.</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;We won&#x2019;t solve this by bickering against each other. &#xA0;We have to be quick in making our decision. &#xA0;Let&#x2019;s do a majority vote.&quot;</span></p><p><span style=""> [Rubbish!]</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;I agree with the method.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Sunggoo and the others were of different opinion as Jaenis. &#xA0;In the end, they started the vote.</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;Well, we have two choices. &#xA0;If you want to retreat, please raise your hand.&quot;</span></p><p><span style=""> Jaenis, Bibi, Minchan and several others raised their hands.</span></p><p><span style=""> [The lord&#x2019;s orders are absolute. ]</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;That&#x2019;s right. &#xA0;We have to follow master&#x2019;s words.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Bibi didn&#x2019;t want to run away, because she was afraid. &#xA0;She didn&#x2019;t care what sacrifices they needed to make. &#xA0;The most important thing to her was Kahng-woojin&#x2019;s last order. &#xA0;This was why she wanted to retreat.</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;Well, if you want to fight, please raise your hand.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Sunggoo and Haesol, who had went on reconnaissance, raised their hands. &#xA0;&#xA0;Minchan was delighted as he spoke.</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;Then let us retreat....&quot;</span></p><p><span style=""> [This is absurd.]</span></p><p><span style="">A roar that made his ears ring was heard. &#xA0;Minchan flinched, and he turned to looked at the Death Knights. &#xA0;They were in a line, and they were all raising their hands.</span></p><p><span style="">To make things worse, Bone Dragon Yong Yong was slightly raising its wing.</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;Ah...&quot;</span></p><p><span style=""> [We fight.]</span></p><p><span style="">Death Knights.</span></p><p><span style="">Kiba, who was the leader of the Death Knights, stepped forward.</span></p><p><span style="">Jaenis&#x2019; eyes immediately flickered with red light.</span></p><p><span style=""> [The master&#x2019;s command is absolute.]</span></p><p><span style=""> [We aren&#x2019;t going against his order!]</span></p><p><span style="">His voice was resolute.</span></p><p><span style=""> [We fight. &#xA0;We fight to win. &#xA0;This is how we protect her.]</span></p><p><span style=""> [.......]</span></p><p><span style="">Everyone was at a loss for words.</span></p><p><span style="">Kiba continued to speak..</span></p><p><span style=""> [The Immortal isn&#x2019;t dead.]</span></p><p><span style="">Kiba spoke the words everyone was tiptoeing around.</span></p><p><span style="">Two beings had clashed, and it had caused an explosion. &#xA0;Now the survivor of the two was charging towards them. &#xA0;It was a Dimensional lord that was letting out energy of darkness.</span></p><p><span style="">Everyone was worried about the whereabout of Kahng-woojin, and they had suppressed those feelings. &#xA0;However, Kiba boldly spoke about it.</span></p><p><span style=""> [The Immortal doesn&#x2019;t run away.]</span></p><p><span style="">Jaenis shook his head from side to side.</span></p><p><span style=""> [I forgot about that.]</span></p><p><span style="">Kiba raised his axe high into the air.</span></p><p><span style=""> [We&#x2019;ll fight to win! &#xA0;Then we will ready ourselves to greet our king!]</span></p><p><span style=""> They just had to take care of the battle then wait for their king.</span></p><p><span style=""> [Ooh-oh-oh-oh!]</span></p><p><span style="">The Death Knights.... &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">The fighting spirit of the Undead Army burned white hot.</span></p>
