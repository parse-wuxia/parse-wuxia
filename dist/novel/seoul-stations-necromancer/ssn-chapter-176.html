<p><span style="">Chapter 176 - Aria&apos;s Temple (2)&#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">The large Symbol grew on top of the Saurus mountain.</span></p><p><span style="">Latasha, who was the Lord of the remaining Elves, lay beneath the World Tree. &#xA0;Latasha was better known by the name Silver Arrow.</span></p><p><span style="">She watched as sunlight reached her from between the foliage, and it was heavenly.</span></p><p><span style="">She was lying still as she felt the tree&#x2019;s breathing. &#xA0;She reminisced about the time when the forests sang to her ancestors.</span></p><p><span style="">She never had the privilege to live in such peace, yet maybe it was an instinct that was passed down through her bloodline.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;What are you doing here?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">She had been silently communing with the silent past, but Do-jaemin&apos;s visit broke her out of her thoughts.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Ah, Count Jaemin.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">He was a human of earth that had turned into a Vampire Lord.</span></p><p><span style="">He was in a weird and dangerous position of being the brother of the Immortal&apos;s woman.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Were you taking a nap?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;No. &#xA0;I was feeling the World Tree breathe.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Hmm. &#xA0;I thought it was merely the Colony&apos;s Symbol....&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;It is a special existence to me.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;....&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Jaemin silently looked at the grown tree. Latasha was the first to laugh. &#xA0;She saw that Jaemin had also put on a serious expression on his face when he heard her words.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Hoo hoo. &#xA0;So why were you looking for me?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Ah. &#xA0;Tauric is gathering all the heroes.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Understood.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Latasha accompanied Do-jaemin, and they walked towards the castle built near the World Tree. &#xA0;The castle built by the Immortal was too large for only the ten heroes to occupy. &#xA0;It felt empty.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Silver Arrow.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;What is it?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Latasha queried when she saw the heroes gathered in one place.</span></p><p><span style="">Each of the heroes were put in charge of a team, and they were supposed to expand out from the Saurus mountain as base to clear the monsters nearby. &#xA0;It was also the reason why this type of gathering hadn&apos;t happened in several days.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;A massive amount of monsters are gathering south at the Nero plateau.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;...that&apos;s the worst news we&apos;ve heard in recent days.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Actually, it get worse.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Tauric spread a map on the table. &#xA0;It was a map that specifically showed the details between the Saurus mountains and the Nero plateau. &#xA0;It was a distance that could be traveled in around two weeks. &#xA0;A human kingdom had once occupied that region, but it was currently ruled by a Dimensional lord named Unon.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;It isn&apos;t just Unon&apos;s army. &#xA0;Shirao, Patu, Leia and Gong Gong are all gathering there.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Latasha&apos;s eyes widened at Tauric&apos;s words. It looked as if her eyes were about to fall out.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;My god. &#xA0;Are you saying the Dimensional lords are working together?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Unfortunately, that is what is happening.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;....&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Dimensional lords never cooperated with each other. They weren&apos;t like blood enemies that fought constantly, but they did fight over territories. &#xA0;This was a reason why the Coalition was able to exist on this planet.</span></p><p><span style="">The Dimensional lords fought wars with each other, and the people of planet was merely their quarry.</span></p><p><span style="">If they cooperated with each other, it would have taken them 1 year to decimate the entirety of Alphen.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;So what is behind this unforeseen move?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">The Coalition was on its last leg, and they were gathering their remaining troops. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">Were they that big of a threat? &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">They should have been beneath the notice of the Dimensional lords.</span></p><p><span style="">The gathering of the Coalition hadn&#x2019;t even aroused the attention of the Dimensional lord Go-shooshoo, Juliel and their armies. &#xA0;In the past, the Coalition had gathered their forces quite often in the past without such a severe response.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I&apos;m not sure. &#xA0;If I had to guess, it might be caused by his return.....&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Immortal...&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">There was only one existence that was excessively burdensome to the Dimensional lords.</span></p><p><span style="">The Dimensional lords started working with each other when the Immortal suddenly showed up. &#xA0;The cause behind their actions was obvious.</span></p><p><span style="">Even a single Dimensional lord was an overwhelming opponent, yet they would have to face 5 Dimensional lords. &#xA0;The Coalition&apos;s forces were like a candle facing the wind.</span></p><p><span style="">Moreover, the existence that could block the wind was with Melody right now as they headed towards Aria&apos;s Temple. &#xA0;They were in deep enemy territory beyond the Nero plateau. </span></p><p><span style="">&quot;If the Immortal isn&apos;t here, it will be too hard to protect this fortress. &#xA0;We have to find a new hideout.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">When king of Honshoo Kontz spoke up, the Archmage Graham agreed with him.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;That&apos;s right. &#xA0;In the first place, the Saurus mountain was the worst place we could have chosen to defend an enemy&apos;s attack. &#xA0;There&#x2019;s the risk that our enemies might isolate us. &#xA0;We have to move our base first.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;No way. &#xA0;How could you throw away a Colony so easily?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Sunggoo yelled out.</span></p><p><span style="">The Colony wasn&#x2019;t merely a place where they could purchase Items using Bloodstones. &#xA0;For the people, who came over from earth, it was the location of the gate. &#xA0;The gate would allow them to go back to their home world.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;The Fire Spirit King is correct. &#xA0;Also, I won&apos;t leave behind the World Tree.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I&apos;m the the Fire Spirit King....&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Sunggoo mumbled at Latasha&apos;s words. &#xA0;Graham tried to convince her with great care.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Oh, Elf Lord. &#xA0;I believe it is a stretch to call it the World Tree.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;No. &#xA0;It is the World Tree.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Latasha ignored Sunggoo&apos;s words, and her answer was full of conviction as she spoke to Graham.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Mmmm.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">The current Elf Lord said it was the World Tree, so how could a human magician say otherwise? &#xA0;However, it wasn&apos;t a wise decision to stay here. &#xA0;They would be slaughtered.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;What can we do? &#xA0;Unon is a high rank great general. &#xA0;He occupies the 36th throne.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;...he built this city, so he&apos;ll protect it.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">It hurt her pride to rely on the Immortal, but she spoke those words quietly. &#xA0;Jaemin, who had been quietly listening from the side, stepped forward.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I can contact him.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Oh oh!&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Do-jaemin had been appointed to be the tactician of Alandal. &#xA0;He could trade thoughts with the Dimensional lord Kahng-woojin. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;He&#x2019;ll be able to come here immediately using the Return Portal if we are in a dire situation.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;That is good news.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">The gloomy atmosphere immediately improved. &#xA0;The Immortal was only one person, but his existence was enough to wipe away the worry of losing the battle.</span></p><p><span style="">Everyone firmly believed the Immortal wouldn&apos;t have problem with these foes. </span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Please inform him of our plight.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">At Graham&apos;s insistence, Do-jaemin quickly tried to contact Woojin.</span></p><p><span style="">[Woojin hyung.]</span></p><p><span style="">[...]</span></p><p><span style="">Everyone looked at him with eyes full of hope. &#xA0;Jaemin kept calling for Woojin, but there was no response.</span></p><p><span style="">Jaemin nervously licked his lips when the anticipation turned into doubt.</span></p><p><span style="">&apos;Will it not work if he is in a different Dimension?&apos;</span></p><p><span style="">He was appointed to be the tactician, but he wasn&apos;t fully aware of the power and the communication capability possessed by a Dimensional lord. &#xA0;Jaemin scratched his head as he spoke. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I think he is clearing a Dungeon.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Hmm. &#xA0;You can&#x2019;t contact him if he is in a Dungeon?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I guess so.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">As if they didn&apos;t believe him, the atmosphere was turning a bit weird when they heard his answer. &#xA0;Tauric stepped forward to clear up the air.</span></p><p><span style="">Since the Immortal and the Holy Maiden wasn&#x2019;t here, the First Monk of Skia became the psychological pillar for the people.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I know we&apos;ve had some complaints initially about setting up here, but in the end, we agreed to it.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;....&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;We settled here, because it was the ideal place for a counteroffensive campaign. &#xA0;We cannot run away at the first sign of the enemies gathering.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;You are right.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">The great Orc Chieftain Kruegar had been quiet, since Latasha had spoken, and now he raised a closed fist.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Koo-roo. &#xA0;I don&apos;t want to die while running away. &#xA0;We shouldn&apos;t be fighting for our survival. &#xA0;We have to fight for victory.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">They had always pushed and delayed their plans into the future. &#xA0;How many comrades were left behind as they ran away? &#xA0;Maybe the time they had been waiting for was at hand.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Alandal and the Coalition are allies. &#xA0;If we can&apos;t defend a Colony from being taken over before he returns, there is no point to this alliance.</span></p><p><span style="">Dwarf King Raul stepped forward.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Let us fight! &#xA0;If we build a fortress as we accelerate our pace in gathering our forces, there is no reason why we won&apos;t be able to defend this place.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">When everyone&apos;s opinions came into alignment, Tauric let out a declaration.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Let&apos;s get ready to defend the Colony.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Ooh-oh-oh!&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">There would be no retreat any more. &#xA0;Since they had gained a sword they could use to counter attack, they couldn&apos;t let go of it even if it was heavy.</span></p><p><span style="">They just have to wait until a sharp and dangerous sword named the Immortal came back to them.</span></p><p><span style="">***</span></p><p><span style="">The earth was so poor and sticky that it made one wonder if it was really dirt underneath their feet. &#xA0;It gave off an unpleasant feeling.</span></p><p><span style="">The large trees were rotten, and an unknown fungus covered the branches.</span></p><p><span style="">There was a musky foul smell. &#xA0;The air was poisonous, and there were no living creatures inside the forest.</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin grumbled.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Why did noonim build a temple here?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Melody was protected by a blessing she asked from her goddess. &#xA0;She answered Woojin&apos;s complaint.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;The goddess did not shy away from penance. &#xA0;She chose to be in this harsh environment....&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin cut off Melody&apos;s words.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Stop making shit up.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;...I&apos;m not making it up. &#xA0;It was passed down...&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Ah. &#xA0;Whatever. &#xA0;There&#x2019;s a saying that says idle words can become law.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;....&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">She was full of counter-arguments she wanted to say, but Melody tried hard to hold back her words. &#xA0;If it wasn&apos;t for Woojin, she wouldn&apos;t have be able to traverse through the enemy territories. &#xA0;She wouldn&apos;t have been able to reach this place.</span></p><p><span style="">It would have taken her two months to walk here. &#xA0;They had taken down every Dungeon and Colony on their way here, yet it took them only a month.</span></p><p><span style="">If they had just rode on the Phantom Steed through the whole journey, it would have halved the time further.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I never heard about such a bizarre place.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin shook his head from side to side as he looked at his surrounding.</span></p><p><span style="">Reeds, which was as thick as a person&#x2019;s thigh, had grown high into the air before they died. &#xA0;There were only stumps left, and there seemed to be fossilized remains covering the floor. &#xA0;It was creepy.</span></p><p><span style="">He could see a corpse of a Wyvern-sized dragonfly, skeleton of an eight-limbed bear, and dead trees. &#xA0;They were all very large.</span></p><p><span style="">If a town was changed into giants and mutants, it would look like this place.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Sniff. I don&apos;t think this is petroleum. &#xA0;What is this?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">The black and sticky liquid covered the floor, and it somehow felt out of place.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;We are almost there. &#xA0;It should be over there.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">She was being guided by her goddess as she walked the maze-like forest road. &#xA0;In the end, they arrived at their destination.</span></p><p><span style="">They went past the unpleasant forest and the ground boiling with the black liquid. &#xA0;Afterwards, a large crater greeted them.</span></p><p><span style="">It was as if a meteor had fallen to make this deep crater. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">In the middle of the crater, one could see a small building covered in black moss.</span></p><p><span style="">At a glance, it looked like a pointy rock, but the sight was strangely incongruous with its surrounding.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;What the hell is that?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;It is goddess Aria&apos;s temple.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;You know I&apos;m not asking about that.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin went to the edge of the crater, and he slowly descended.</span></p><p><span style="">Pshhhh.</span></p><p><span style="">The ground crumbled every time Woojin brought a foot down. &#xA0;The ground was unstable as jagged stones kept catching on his feet.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Are these bones?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">He had thought they were jagged stones, but they were bones.</span></p><p><span style="">He didn&apos;t know if they were from animals or people. &#xA0;Several thousand...tens of thousand unidentifiable bones made up the ground.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;....&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin silently walked forward. &#xA0;Melody was following behind him, and her face had also turned serious.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Have you been here before?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;This is my first time.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">She would have needed to come here to become the official Holy Maiden, but this was Melody&apos;s first visit. &#xA0;She was here to receive her Holy Item. &#xA0;It would signify that Melody was the closest servant of Aria.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;This is...&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Goddess of Prophecy Aria.</span></p><p><span style="">Melody had called it a temple, so he had thought....</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin and Melody went to the heart of the deep and large crater. &#xA0;They stood in front of a black building that looked like a pillar curved like a horn.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Doesn&apos;t it look unbalanced?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;...&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">She didn&apos;t even have the words to answer Woojin&apos;s question. &#xA0;She also hadn&apos;t heard anything about Aria&apos;s Temple. &#xA0;She felt a tug from the goddess&apos; revelation, and she only knew how to get to this place through instinct.</span></p><p><span style="">Zz-zz-jook.</span></p><p><span style="">The black moss started to rip away. &#xA0;A rectangular outline could be seen as the door shifted.</span></p><p><span style="">Too-shoo-shoong!</span></p><p><span style="">The moss fell to the floor as the door opened.</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin was silent as he saw what was across the entrance.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;....&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Oh goddess.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">When the door opened, a large amount of the goddess&apos; energy flowed out into Melody. &#xA0;Melody fell to her knees as she prostrated on the floor.</span></p><p><span style="">At her reaction, Woojin&#x2019;s sense of incongruity, which had bothered him, reached its </span></p><p><span style="">&quot;It&#x2019;s a spaceship.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">There was no other explanation.</span></p><p><span style="">If he wanted to know the reason behind all of this, he&#x2019;ll have to face this head on.</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin took his first step across the door.</span></p>
