<p><strong>Chapter 22 Dual Class.</strong></p><p></p><div id="chapterContent" class="innerContent fr-view"><p></p><p><span style="">Chapter 22 &#x2013; Dual Class</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p><p><span style="">(TLN: I was able to get into a translating groove yesterday, so here&#x2019;s another regular chapter.?? This will probably be the last release this week unless there is a sponsored ch. Next week will probably be Dragon Maken and either Elq/SSN. I&#x2019;m also pondering whether I should start another project. Was the alternating 2 novels each week an unpleasant reading experience? Let me know. I appreciate any input. Please turn off your adblockers if you are able to. Thanks~)</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Huk, huk. Do you think we can rest a little bit, hyung-nim?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">For the most part, Woojin didn&#x2019;t directly participate in battle. The Rakwis were considered to be a 3 star monster, because there were a frighteningly a lot of them.</span></p><p><span style="">It was so bad that a fight with the Rakwis wasn&#x2019;t considered to be a fight against a monster. It was a fight against oneself . Everything ended the moment one became tired.</span></p><p><span style="">The Skeleton Soldiers never got tired, and he just had to summon a new one when one was destroyed.</span></p><p><span style="">Moreover, the Skeleton Soldiers&#x2019; appearance had gone through a change. The Skeleton Soldier&#x2019;s Skill Level had risen from 1 to 10 and they had evolved.</span></p><p><span style="">The Skeleton Soldier were made out out bones, so its emaciated body looked quite brittle. However, they now wore shoulder and chest armor. They also carried a small shield on one hand.</span></p><p><span style="">The knives still looked very dull, but it had become larger and more pointy. They also wore a helmet on their heads.</span></p><p><span style="">As one uses more of one&#x2019;s skill, the Skill level increases. It can also be raised using the help of an item or one could invest one&#x2019;s bonus point into it. These were the only methods.</span></p><p><span style="">His hunting speed was becoming faster, and he was having an easier time. The problem was Sunggoo&#x2019;s stamina.</span></p><p><span style="">He was on the bloodstone duty for 3 hours, and he hadn&#x2019;t been able to take a single break. Woojin&#x2019;s hunting speed was so fast that Sunggoo didn&#x2019;t have time to take a break. Woojin had run out of spray paint, but it seemed he had learned a Marking magic. He used it to mark the monsters containing the bloodstones.</span></p><p><span style="">He kept showing his admiration as he watched Woojin&#x2019;s endless versatility.</span></p><p><span style="">Eventually, Sunggoo couldn&#x2019;t help it as his stamina flagged.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;All right. Let&#x2019;s rest for a moment.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Sunggoo let out a groan, and Woojin plopped himself on the floor. Sunggoo sat next to him, and he took out a bottled water from his bag. He gave it to Woojin first.</span></p><p><span style="">Sunggoo was drenched in sweat and he had a tired expression on his face. However, he still gave Woojin the water first. Woojin grinned.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Dude. You are going to live a long life.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I like the cut of your jib.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin drank a gulp of water then he handed it to Sunggoo. Sunggoo kept gulping down the water like a man who had come across an oasis in the desert.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hyahh.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">It felt like the water was being absorbed into his bones. Sunggoo&#x2019;s body shook then he relaxed.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;How much time do we have left?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;We have 1 hour and 12 minutes..&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">As time passed, their pace had increased. They had already completed the Dungeon 6 times before 3 hours had passed.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;The adjust amount is&#x2026; I think it&#x2019;s over $300,000? We should almost have $400,000?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The Bloodstones Exchange store took a fixed amount from the final figure to give a fee to the first Roused, who defeated the Dungeon. The association also took a portion, but the rest was automatically deposited into Roused Registration account.</span></p><p><span style="">As Woojin looked at the knocked-down Sunggoo, he pondered over an idea.</span></p><p><span style="">He would be able to purchase a decent house for Sooah and his mother with $300,000. Money was basically the means to an end. It was a tool to get what he want, but the money itself wasn&#x2019;t his goal.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;I&#x2019;ll give up on the bloodstones.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin stood up from his seat.</span></p><p><span style="">Sunggoo followed his example, and he also got up.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ooh-ook.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hey, Sunggoo.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes, hyung-nim.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;The bloodstone we excavate from now on is all yours.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I&#x2019;ll mark it for you, so do your best in excavating it.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;H&#x2026;hyung-nim?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Keep up the good work.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin almost ran as he led the Skeletons downstair.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Well, should I record my lap time?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Kekeke.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Sunggoo blankly glanced down towards the stairway where Woojin had disappeared to.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hy&#x2026;hyung-nim?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">If he excavated all the bloodstones before Woojin could end his hunt, he would be able to make around $50,000. He didn&#x2019;t care about the price of his life right now. The amount of money he was able to make was contingent on how much he moved. He was tired for only a moment.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ooh-oh-oh!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Before the Marking magic could disappear, he hurriedly swung his short sword.</span></p><p><span style="">After Sunggoo entered the Dungeon, he started moving like a madman. He tried to close the distance between Woojin, and he excavated the bloodstones from the marked Rakwi&#x2019;s corpses. He had repeated this action for several hours, so he had already become an expert in cracking open the Rakwi&#x2019;s head.</span></p><p><span style="">However, Woojin&#x2019;s hunting speed was too fast. Sunggoo was able to clear only one floor before Woojin was coming back up with the Return Stone.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Ah ah, my money!&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">When he thought about the marked Rakwi corpses below, he wanted to pound against the floor. However, he couldn&#x2019;t do anything about it. He followed Woojin out of the Dungeon to enter it again.</span></p><p><span style="">There was 20 minutes left before his 4 hour of using the Dungeon came to an end. Before Woojin could step on to the last floor, he stopped walking.</span></p><p>&lt;Level up!&gt;</p><p>&lt;You have reached level 10. You class is being sorted.&gt;</p><p><span style="">Woojin was taken aback. He tilted his head in confusion.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Class?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Originally, one would have to choose one&#x2019;s class at level 10. He had chosen to become a Necromancer on Planet Alphen. When he was transferred here, he had already chosen the Necromancer class&#x2026;.</span></p><p><span style="">He thought hard as he looked at the window that popped up in front of his eyes.</span></p><p>&lt;You Movement Pattern is being analyzed.&gt;</p><p>&lt;Your class is being selected.&gt;</p><p>&lt;Magician&gt;&lt;Elementalist&gt;&lt;Warrior&gt;&lt;Priest&gt;&lt;Trapper&gt;&#x2026;.</p><p><span style="">Woojin frowned when an endless banquet of classes popped up. He had already experienced this when he reached level 10 on the Alphen Planet. The problem was he already had a class.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Does this mean I can have a Dual Class?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">He thought hard on it, but that was only answer that came to him.</span></p><p>&lt;The &#x2018;Warrior&#x2019; class was chosen.&gt;</p><p>&lt; For class designation reward, you will be given a Warrior&#x2019;s weapon.&gt;</p><p><span style="">Woojin let out a sigh.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Doesn&#x2019;t this put me in a tough spot?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">His skills and stats were not connected to each other. He had some skills where he needed magic, and some skills required vitality.</span></p><p><span style="">Necromancer was a class that specialized in magic and control.</span></p><p><span style="">If he had become a Magician then there were a certain amount of overlap in skills. However, when one reaches level 10, one&#x2019;s class is determined by one&#x2019;s movement pattern.</span></p><p><span style="">If he knew there was a Dual Class, then he would have only used magic from level 1. He wouldn&#x2019;t have swung his clawed hammer.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Well, I can&#x2019;t do anything about it.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">He&#x2019;ll probably run out of stat points, but he had planned on using the bonus points to focus on his Necromancy. The Warrior class was just a throw-in.</span></p><p><span style="">He decided to think of it like that.</span></p><p><span style="">He&#x2019;ll just think of his main weapon as back up weapon.</span></p><p><span style="">He&#x2019;ll have to do his best to raise his stat using liquid drugs or magic drugs. As he organized his thoughts, he quickly threw away any regret.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;The reward.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin immediately opened his inventory.</span></p><p><span style="">He was curious as to what he received as bonus reward when his class was chosen.</span></p><p><span style="">The Warrior&#x2019;s bonus reward was a weapon. He also received a Summoning Demon for when he was a Necromancer, and it was capable of growth.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Huh? There are two of them?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&lt;Warrior&#x2019;s Bonus &#x2013; Warrior&#x2019;s Weapon&gt;</span></p><p><span style="">&lt;Necromancer&#x2019;s Bonus &#x2013; Sealed Demon Stone.&gt;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin grinned.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Dual class&#x2026; I guess it isn&#x2019;t so bad?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin took out the Warrior&#x2019;s bonus reward.</span></p><p><span style="">Pah-paht.</span></p><p><span style="">A blue box appeared. As the light dispersed, a rod was pushed towards him. It was curved like a cane. It looked to be a magician&#x2019;s staff, but the composition was very different from a normal staff.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;It..it&#x2019;s a steel pipe?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The staff was made out of steel, and it looked like the steel claw hammer. The battles up until now must have influenced its appearance.</span></p><p>&lt;Steel Staff&gt;</p><p><span style="">A warrior&#x2019;s weapon was basically one&#x2019;s best friend, and they are akin to one&#x2019;s life. The Warrior&#x2019;s weapon grew alongside the user. It is always with you, and it is always ready to come out at your beck and call.</span></p><p><span style="">Effect : Strength +5, Durability Recovery(Dispelled State)</span></p><p><span style="">Skill : Summon, Dispel</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin held the Steel Staff in one hand, and he thought about dispelling it. As soon as he thought about it, it disappeared.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Summon.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Pa-paht.</span></p><p><span style="">It suddenly appeared in mid-air. Woojin grabbed it in his hand, and he had a satisfied smile on his face.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;This isn&#x2019;t so bad?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">He obtained a weapon he could pull out at any moment, so it was a good thing. Moreover, the weapon was able to evolve. The was an infinite possibility in how it would advance. It also didn&#x2019;t take up any space in his inventory, so it was great.</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin&#x2019;s heart fluttered a little bit as he took out the Sealed Demon Stone.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I wonder which bastard is in here?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">He didn&#x2019;t know if he had bee lucky or unlucky on the Planet Alphen. He netted a succubus and she was of no help in battle. Still, he hadn&#x2019;t been bored since she like to talk a lot.</span></p><p><span style="">Pah-paht.</span></p><p><span style="">The summoning stone disappeared, and a thick smoke rose up. The smoke coalesced into the shape of a small child.</span></p><p><span style="">She was a cute girl with a black one piece dress and she wore a hat with lace hanging off of it.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Master!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Uh uh?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">A small female child suddenly hugged him&#x2026;. He lifted the small demon off of him.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;You&#x2026; Bibi?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes, master. Where have you been?&#x201D; (TLN: She&#x2019;s speaking in a very cutesy way. It&#x2019;ll be lost in translation)</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin could only dumbly stare down at his low ranked succubus, Bibi. He crouched to look Bibi in her eyes.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What? Why did you show up?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Heeng. Master unsealed me right now.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Huh huh.</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin&#x2019;s head hurt from his troublesome thoughts. He clutched his head, and he pressed firmly on his temple. Then he asked Bibi a question.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Did the dimensional travel bring you with me&#x2026; No, you said you were sealed&#x2026;&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I&#x2019;m so happy I was able to meet master again. Anyways, what is this smell? It smells like Trahnet&#x2019;s minions&#x2026;.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Bibi pointed towards the Rakwis at the last floor.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What? Trahnet&#x2019;s minion?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Trahnet was the name of the demon, who had invaded the Planet Alphen. Demon wasn&#x2019;t the right description. He was a calamity.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;They are letting out a similar smell&#x2026;&#x2026;.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Bibi&#x2019;s words made his press hands against his temple again.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Trahnet&#x2019;s invasion reached earth? This might be why the Dungeons formed here&#x2026;&#x2026;.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">He had know way of knowing if it was true. He felt a strange sense of danger, and it got on his nerves. He had escaped hell, but the hell was trying come here.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;If it is Jaenis-nim, then he would know. Heh heh.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Jaenis?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Sage Jaenis.</span></p><p><span style="">He was considered to be one of the top mages on the Alphen Planet. After Trahnet invasion, he had turned himself into a Lich.</span></p><p><span style="">He had become a Lich, and he existed for 200 years as he lived alongside Alphen&#x2019;s history.</span></p><p><span style="">Amongst the family he commanded, the best was of course the undead magician. Lich.</span></p><p><span style="">He never thought he would hear that name again.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes. He was in the Sealed room with me. There was RyongRyong, ShingShing and even Kiba-nim. Also&#x2026;.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hey. Wait a moment. What is this Sealed room?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I&#x2019;m not sure. It was like the Summoning room except master&#x2019;s voice didn&#x2019;t reach there.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The Summoning room was where Woojin&#x2019;s family gathered before they were summoned. It was like his inventory. It was a type of pocket dimension, and it was his family&#x2019;s paradise.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Are you saying everyone is sealed?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes. I was the very first one to hear master&#x2019;s voice.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin finally understood the situation. His necromancer class had transferred with him.</span></p><p><span style="">His entire familiar beings had been sealed until he was able to call on them. He had to be lvl80 to do the Lich Summoning. It seemed the level restriction was the cause of his family being sealed.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;If Earth has been invaded by Trahnet&#x2026;&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">He understood why the Dungeons had formed here. At the same time, he felt a sense of crisis. It wasn&#x2019;t the time to leisurely kill the monsters to excavate the bloodstones.</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin felt the need to level up faster.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hyung-nim!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">He heard a voice from upstairs. He turned to look at Bibi.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;You should go back in.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hiing. I want to stay by master&#x2019;s side.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I&#x2019;ll call you again, so go back in.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I understand. I&#x2019;ll be able to hear master&#x2019;s voice inside the Summoning room.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Pah-paht.</span></p><p><span style="">Bibi turned into a single strand of smoke as she disappeared. At the same time, Sunggoo came running down the stairs.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Uh? Did you hear a girl&#x2019;s voice right now, hyung-nim?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Uh. I didn&#x2019;t hear it.,&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Uh? Why are you still here?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Let&#x2019;s conclude our hunt today after we take care of the monsters down there.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">They would barely be able to do one more Dungeon run, but Sunggoo was as exhausted as he could be. So he readily nodded his head</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I understand.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin had a complicated expression on his face as he dragged his Skeleton troop down the stairs.</span></p><p></p></div><p></p>
