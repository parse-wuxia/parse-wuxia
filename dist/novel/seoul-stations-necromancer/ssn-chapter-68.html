Thanks and enjoy~)</span></span></p><p><span style="">The grilled beef entrails quickly disappeared, and several rounds of alcohol was passed around. Several people were drunk, and their faces were red.</span></p><p><span style="">This was especially true for Woo-soonghoon. He had drunk faster than anyone else, and his eyes were already half closed.&#x201C;Ooh ooh. President is quite strong against alcohol.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Woo-soonghoon, who had bragged about playing around a little in the past, couldn&#x2019;t hold his liquor. He wagged his tongue towards Woojin. Woojin drank his soju, and his expression didn&#x2019;t change at all.</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin grinned.</span></p><p><span style="">If he compared soju to Alphen&#x2019;s alcohol, it was like drinking water.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hook hook. President drinks alcohol well, so why did you hit me??&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hey. Why are you being like this?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Sunggoo and Haemin tried to hold back Woo-soonghoon as they were mindful of Woojin.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;It hurt. So what if I overpriced the hand phones I sold? It happens! Hoo-ook.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;&#x2026;.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Should he feel regret about not killing that bastard?</span></p><p><span style="">Sunggoo and Haemin saw Woojin&#x2019;s expression turn sour, so they quickly put Woo-soonghoon inside the car. When Soonghoon was leaned against the back seat, he immediately fell asleep.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ooh whew.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Sunggoo laid Soonghoon down, then he asked a question using his liquid courage.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;So, hyung-nim.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Uh, what?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I worry you don&#x2019;t pay enough attention to the mass media every time I observe you. &#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin grinned.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What&#x2019;s the point of caring?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Mmm. Isn&#x2019;t it annoying? The reporters will flock to you&#x2026;&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I&#x2019;m used to it.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;That&#x2019;s&#x2026;.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">How could his words not get through to Woojin? Sunggoo couldn&#x2019;t coherently get his point across, so he was frustrated. Jung-minchan, who was listening from the side, understood what Sunggoo was trying to say, so he chipped in with his words.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;You will have problems with the law, and you might have to worry about international isolation. What is the benefit of making enemies?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I&#x2019;m making enemies&#x2026;.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin stroked his chin. After he drank a shot of alcohol, he looked at Sunngoo, Minchan and Haemin. They were all Alandal&#x2019;s guild members, so they would have to know about this eventually.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;In the past, I thought the same as you guys. I was mindful of other nations. I was scared about the public sentiment, and I was conscious of how others looked at me.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">What happened in Alandal that made him so unreasonable now?</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Laws exists right now since countries exist. How long do you think that will last?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Everyone&#x2019;s attention was on Woojin when he asked such a ridiculous question.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;The Dungeons will erupt. Moreover, it will explode soon. It isn&#x2019;t far away. It is imminent.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">He didn&#x2019;t have evidence supporting his claim. However, he could feel it. The Dungeon Breaks weren&#x2019;t far away. Moreover, it will be a widespread Break.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Try thinking about what would happen if all the Dungeons on earth overflowed at the same time.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;&#x2026;.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">An apocalypse.</span></p><p><span style="">It was too horrible to imagine, so no one opened their mouth. It felt as if the alcohol drained right out of them.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;However, we have a military. They&#x2019;ll be able to block it.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin snorted.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;If it&#x2019;s only 6 star monsters, they will be able to block them. What about the higher ranked monsters?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Do you think this was the endgame? Mmm. Let&#x2019;s see. The 6 star monsters are like the dogs you grow in your house. The tigers, lions and carnivorous elephants will pour out soon. If it doesn&#x2019;t end there, dragons might also come out later.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;&#x2026;.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Should they believe his word or not?</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;If the Specters come out right now, the modern technologies would be useless. How are you going to block them? Are you going to hack them? It would basically be suicide. If the world falls apart, the border that make up nations would be meaningless. Ethics would crumble, and only the drive to survive would be left. It is in our instinct to do so.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;&#x2026;.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The scary thoughts made Sunggoo&#x2019;s body shake a little bit.</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin continued to speak in a composed manner.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;The entire world would simultaneously fall into anarchy. Do you know what will happen? All the crazy people will crawl out of the woodwork. Rape and pillaging will become the norm. Monsters are scary, but humans are weak. So humans will try to steal from other humans.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I&#x2019;m sure there will be people like the ones you describe, but I&#x2019;m sure we&#x2019;ll unite our strength to fight.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Yes. There had been humans who acted that way. There were heroes, warriors, holy knights, and Holy Maidens. There were magicians in their towers, kings of the allied kingdoms, knights, soldiers&#x2026;.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;It&#x2019;ll be futile. They&#x2019;ll keep trying to hold out, but they&#x2019;ll eventually fall. They&#x2019;ll eventually be broken up. Then people will be tempted to turn their backs on the human race.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">There were a lot of races, who had submitted to Trahnet, and they became slaves. Goblins and Kobolds were all Trahnet&#x2019;s slaves.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;S&#x2026;so what do we do? Someone has to stop this&#x2026;.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Sunggoo was in mid-sentence when he turned to look at Woojin. That someone might be Woojin? If he thought about it, no one had soloed a 6 star Dungeon before.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;This is why we are getting ready.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Earth was Woojin&#x2019;s home planet. His mother, sister and friends lived here. This was why he was trying to protect this place.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;You want me to be careful and care about what other&#x2019;s think? The negative articles from the press? Requests to appear before the police? It&#x2019;s all useless. Instead, I have to let everyone know.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">What was he trying to inform everyone?</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I want them to know how brutal, vicious and tyrannical I am..&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">He didn&#x2019;t care if the world talked about him as he became the focus of their attention. For the most part, Woojin didn&#x2019;t have a sense of justice or a conscience. The past 20 years was too brutal for those ideals to have survived within him.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I don&#x2019;t care what they world says about me. I&#x2019;m not trying to be a hero.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">A powerful sovereign.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;No one ran away in my country of Alandal. Those who fought bravely found sanctuary in Alandal. The ones who ran away was turned into the Undead, and they marched against the enemies.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin grinned as he saw everyone&#x2019;s serious expression.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;At the very least, humans didn&#x2019;t fight each other in Alandal. If they did, the king would assign them to a life-time military service. They all knew the score. They all knew how ruthless, and tyrannical the king was.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Sunggoo swallowed his saliva.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Perhaps&#x2026; Does the country called Alandal have something to do with our guild&#x2026;.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin grinned.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Of course. I was the king of Alandal.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">No wonder he hummed a song even when he killed Bae-dohsooh&#x2019;s party. (TLN: 2 star Dungeon where he saved Sunggoo)</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;&#x2026;.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Minchan, Sunggoo and Haemin shut their mouth tightly. They couldn&#x2019;t help, but put on a serious expression.</span></p><p><span style="">Minchan asked carefully.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Shouldn&#x2019;t you be informing the world, and ask for help?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Poot.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin couldn&#x2019;t help but laugh.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Who&#x2019;s going to give us aid? The people of this world? Should I tell everyone to gather strength and get ready, since the whole earth will become a field for the monsters?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Wouldn&#x2019;t that be prudent?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I&#x2019;m pretty sure they won&#x2019;t do anything.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;If they feel a threat, then I&#x2019;m sure we will all come together.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin popped a piece of beef entrail into his mouth, and he started chewing.</span></p><p><span style="">Shit. It was undercooked.</span></p><p><span style="">He spat out the beef entrail on an empty dish, then he cleansed his palate with cider.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;We still excavate fossil fuel even when we know it is destroying nature.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Wasn&#x2019;t this a problem on a different stratosphere with destroying nature. The human race could become instinct.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hey, Minchan. Do you think you will be able to stop people from extracting fossil fuel just by saying, &#x2018;Let&#x2019;s protect nature?&#x2019;&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;&#x2026;.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin took out his hand phone then he place it on top of the table.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;The moment I saw this I gave up on that idea.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What does the hand phone have anything to do with&#x2026;&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Crazy Red.</span></p><p><span style="">It was a modern device using bloodstones as a new energy source.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What would happen if I immediately tried to stop people from excavating the bloodstones from the Dungeons? They can only clear the Dungeons, and they will have to come out empty handed.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;&#x2026;.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">If there was no loot from raiding the Dungeon, no one would risk their life to clear the Dungeons.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Even if the excavation of bloodstones were halted, the amount of mana on earth will still increase by a minute amount. It will delay the Dungeon Breaks. It will give humans the time to get ready. What do you think? Isn&#x2019;t it quite logical? Do you think the humans will be able to do so?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;&#x2026;.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Minchan lost the words he was about to say.</span></p><p><span style="">They wouldn&#x2019;t stop. There was absolutely no way people would stop.</span></p><p><span style="">The Dungeon Business was already too closely intertwined with the way of the world. The rulers, and people with wealth would want the resource called bloodstones.</span></p><p><span style="">The train filled with bombs had already left the station.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;W&#x2026;what should we do then?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The words spoken by Woojin seemed perfectly plausible, so even a logical person like Minchan was in a near panic. It felt as if a threat had suddenly crept up on him.</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin grinned.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What should we do? We drink soju like this, then we grow in power by clearing Dungeons.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">How would they be able to drink alcohol after hearing such serious matters? The effects of the alcohol quickly dissipated from the three people.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Kyahh.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin emptied another shot of soju, then he chewed on a crispy piece of beef entrails.</span></p><p><span style="">The three of them looked at Woojin with serious expressions on their faces.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Well? What? What do you expect from me?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Even if he asked everyone to protect earth, people wouldn&#x2019;t listen to him.</span></p><p><span style="">Humans didn&#x2019;t unite from being in danger. They united for profit.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;If they die, they die. If they live, they&#x2019;ll live. Those who will fight will fight..&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;&#x2026;.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Even a Philosophy Professor wouldn&#x2019;t be able to talk in such a casual manner.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;There is some hope. The bloodstones brings the monsters over, but it also levels up the Roused on earth.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">This was the first time hopeful words had been spoken by Woojin&#x2019;s mouth. The three people looked on with anticipation in their eyes.</span></p><p><span style="">The power of the allies and enemies increased simultaneously.</span></p><p><span style="">The fight would vary depending on how those power would be assembled.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;This is why I am very aggressive.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">He had always wanted to come back to earth, and the situation here was very different from Alphen. This was earth. This was a place Woojin must defend at all cost. He didn&#x2019;t want to see Trahnet&#x2019;s underlings traipsing around freely.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I&#x2019;ll probably continue to get into trouble. I&#x2019;ll never break the rules I established.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">His actions was in line with Alandal&#x2019;s law.</span></p><p><span style="">An eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth.</span></p><p><span style="">Never show weakness.</span></p><p><span style="">Those who stab him in the back must pay a price.</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin&#x2019;s rules took precedent over following earth&#x2019;s laws. In a world where law and morality was gone, his rules would restore order.</span></p><p><span style="">When the pandemonium arrives, people would search and gather around a pivotal figure. Woojin was readying himself to become this pivotal figure.</span></p><p><span style="">He&#x2019;ll even become a ruthless demon to achieve it.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;This is how it&#x2019;ll be, so do your best to keep up with me.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;&#x2026;.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">A special command was given to the support division of Alandal.</span></p><p><span style="">However, unlike before they felt a heavy sense of duty.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;If they mess with me, then they are fucked. I have to instill this concept.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">He had to instill it into the people of this world.</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin had planned for this, and he was already erecting boundary of Alandal.</span></p><p><span style="">*</span></p><p><span style="">Hwarang Guild Headquarters President&#x2019;s Room.</span></p><p><span style="">Di-ri-reek.</span></p><p><span style="">The hand on the mouse roughly scrolled down using the wheel.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Eeeek.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Lee-sahngho grinded his teeth.</span></p><p><span style="">He became angrier as he saw more articles on Kahng-woojin.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Shit. How is this possible?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">[The Hero who Saved North Korea from a Crisis]</span></p><p><span style="">[The beginning of a North South Roused organization? Largest benefactor Kahngwooin.]</span></p><p><span style="">[Rapid Progress between North and South Korea. The 20th Meeting of Separated Families is being Readied.]</span></p><p><span style="">[Dungeon Closer Rank AA Roused Kahgn-Woojin.

There will be no future Dungeon Breaks with Kahng-woojin around.]</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What kind of a bullshit situation is this? They treat this violent man as a hero? Huh. Good going, South Korea!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Kahng-woojin was still under suspicion for assaulting him yet there wasn&#x2019;t a single line in the articles mentioning that fact.</span></p><p><span style="">Lee-sahngho&#x2019;s insides were boiling, and there were no methods that could calm him down.</span></p><p><span style="">Ddi-ri-ri.</span></p><p><span style="">When the interphone rang, he pressed the interphone&#x2019;s button in annoyance.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">[President. The chief of the police is on the line.]</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What? Put him through.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The police chief was a big fish, and Lee-sahngho had met him only once before. He had steadily worked to become close to this person, and it hadn&#x2019;t been easy. He couldn&#x2019;t believe a person of such stature was calling him first.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;This is Hwarang guild&#x2019;s president Lee-sahngho.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">[It&#x2019;s Lee-chuldong.]</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes, Chief Lee. We&#x2019;ve met previously on senator Che&#x2019;s 60th birthday.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">[I won&#x2019;t beat around the bush. Let&#x2019;s close Mr. Kahng-woojin&#x2019;s assault case.]</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What? It was an incident that was live broadcasted to the entire country , Chief. More than 50 million citizens witnessed it yet you want to cover it up?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">[It was an order that came down from the top. I know it is unfair, but let&#x2019;s just cover it up.]</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;this doesn&#x2019;t make any sense.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">[I&#x2019;ve delivered the message. I&#x2019;ll presume you understood what I&#x2019;m saying. I&#x2019;m ending this call.]</span></p><p><span style="">Ddoo, ddoo.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Chief. Chief?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">A vein popped out on Lee-sahngho&#x2019;s forehead.</span></p><p><span style="">He threw the phone in his grasp.</span></p><p><span style="">Kwah-dahng-tahng.</span></p><p><span style="">The line coming off the receiver was connected to the interphone, and the whole system was thrown to the floor.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Those sons of bitches!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">They have all gone mad.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Good going, citizens of South Korea! Shit. Doesn&#x2019;t this country respect personal rights anymore?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">They were all rotten to the core.</span></p><p><span style="">After venting for a while, Lee-sahngho opened a safe hidden within a wall. He took out an old memo note, then he took photos of all the business transactions listed on the the paper.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Shit. Let&#x2019;s see if he could resist calling me after I do this.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Chairman Kim had been avoiding his call for the past several weeks, so Lee-sahngho sent him the picture. Before several minutes could pass, the phone rang.</span></p><p><span style="">Lee-sahngho put on a dirty smile as he pressed the talk button.</span></p><p><span style="">[Are you really going to be like this? Are you threatening a mutual suicide!]</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;If you agree to my single request, then I will destroy the ledger.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">[What is it?]</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I know of your dealings in the Middle East. Please connect me to them.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">[&#x2026;&#x2026;.]</span></p><p><span style="">After a long silence, Chairman Kim had no choice, but to assent to his request. He would be put in a very bad position if his ledger was revealed.</span></p><p><span style="">[All right. Let us meet, and you bring the ledger.]</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes, Chairman.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">After ending the call, Lee-sahngho put on a gruesome smile.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;You dared to hit me?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">He picked a fight with the wrong opponent.</span></p><p><span style="">He dared to lay his hands on Hwarang&#x2019;s Guild Master Lee-sahngho.</span></p><p></p></div><p></p>
