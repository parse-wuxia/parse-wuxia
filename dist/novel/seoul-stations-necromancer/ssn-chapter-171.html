<p>Chapter 171 - Oracle (2)</p><p><span style="">&quot;You will finally find the answer, yet you will lose your way. &#xA0;Illusions and truths are alike. &#xA0;Life and death is also a choice.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Sunggoo turned his head when he heard the sweet voice. &#xA0;He asked Melody a question.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Is that the words given to hyung by the goddess Aria?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Yes, it was.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;So why is it bad?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Melody furrowed her forehead when she heard Sunggoo&apos;s innocent question. &#xA0;Jaemin also shook his head from side to side as he spoke.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;...it isn&apos;t positive.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Is that so? &#xA0;Hmmm. &#xA0;What did hyung-nim say about it?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I&apos;m not privy to...&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Jaemin&apos;s gaze shifted towards Melody, so Sunggoo turned his gaze towards her too. &#xA0;She was the Holy Maiden, and she had delivered the oracle to Woojin. &#xA0;She probably also heard his answer to it.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;The Immortal...&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">The Holy Maiden hesitated before she repeated his words.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Stop saying shitty things that doesn&#x2019;t answer anything. &#xA0;Just do a good job in gathering the Coalition....&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;....&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Of course, hyung-nim would say something like that.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">Sunggoo stroked his chin.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Then there won&apos;t be any problem.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;....&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Melody had to bite her lips at Sunggoo&apos;s conclusion. &#xA0;She had never expected to meet someone besides Kahng-woojin, who treated the prophecy of goddess Aria as a footnote. &#xA0;No, she never expected to meet another man, who treated it as a baseless fear.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Hyung. This is the words coming from the goddess of prophecy. &#xA0;We should weigh her words carefully. &#xA0;We have to get ready for the worst possible scenario.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Melody nodded along with Jaemin&apos;s words.</span></p><p><span style="">At the very least, there was someone around the Immortal that thought like a normal human being.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;A goddess is saying these stuff, so how are we supposed to prepare against it?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;We have to analyze the prophecy, and we have to minimize the dangers....&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Eh-ee. &#xA0;I don&apos;t know anything about that. &#xA0;It is too complicated. &#xA0;I&apos;d trust hyung-nim more than a goddess.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;....&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Sunggoo waved his hand, and he headed towards the Colony that was almost completed.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I thought you were trying to say that the oracle was important.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">That is what they were trying to say&#x2026; &#xA0;It is important.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;It might be talking about our deaths. &#xA0;Aren&apos;t you leery about it?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Sunggoo shrugged his shoulders at Jaemin&apos;s words.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;If I was going to die, I would have been burnt to a crisp by now.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Hyung...&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Jaemin couldn&apos;t come up with more words to argue with Sunggoo. &#xA0;He had looked into the deep depth of Sunggoo&apos;s eyes. &#xA0;The light in his eyes said that Sunggoo had moved beyond death, and it was all the answer that was needed.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;The best way to handle this is to not think about it.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Yes, hyung.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Was this the difference in how much they trusted Kahng-woojin? &#xA0;Do-jaemin reflected deeply on Sunggoo&apos;s words.</span></p><p><span style="">&apos;Sunggoo-hyung believes in him more than anyone else.&apos;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;If I keep thinking about it, it&apos;ll just make my head hurt.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Uh?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">The reason behind it was a bit strange.</span></p><p><span style="">Hong-sunggoo had been by Woojin the longest on earth. &#xA0;As he stood by Woojin, it seemed faith in Woojin wasn&apos;t what had grown inside Sunggoo. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">Maybe Sunggoo&apos;s brain was cleared?</span></p><p><span style="">At the very least, his words made one become suspicious of such a possibility. &#xA0;However, they didn&apos;t have enough free time to discuss such topics.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Somehow, it will all work out. &#xA0;I think.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Was he trying to cheer her up?</span></p><p><span style="">Melody silently nodded her head at Jaemin&apos;s words. &#xA0;Goddess Aria&apos;s prophecies were never wrong.</span></p><p><span style="">The message she had delivered was clear.</span></p><p><span style="">If Woojin obtains the treasure he had long been looking for, he might get lost. &#xA0;He might lose the path back to his home.</span></p><p><span style="">&apos;It is a horrible thing.&apos;</span></p><p><span style="">Holy Maiden Melody had already experienced it before.</span></p><p><span style="">She had gathered the Dimensional Fragments, and she had become a Dimensional lord to look for help.</span></p><p><span style="">She had lost all her Points when all the other lords attacked her, and she had lost her Dungeon. &#xA0;In the end, she had no idea how she would get back to her home planet of Alphen.</span></p><p><span style="">She was barely able to throw away her Domain before she had headed towards earth.</span></p><p><span style="">She was able to come back to Alphen after a long period of time.</span></p><p><span style="">She had delivered her analyses of the oracle to Woojin.</span></p><p><span style="">Of course, the words that were spoken to her in return wasn&apos;t that nice.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;What the hell do you want me to do?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">The Immortal would come to his own conclusions, and he would make his own choices. &#xA0;Melody&apos;s words wouldn&apos;t be able to change his actions.</span></p><p><span style="">&apos;It isn&apos;t something that should go in one ear and out the other.&apos;</span></p><p><span style="">The problem was they were treating the oracle as a divination coming from a fortune-teller. &#xA0;However, Aria&apos;s oracle wasn&apos;t something that could be easily ignored.</span></p><p><span style="">Aria&apos;s prophecy was never wrong.</span></p><p><span style="">&apos;Maybe I am being presumptuous by worrying for him.&apos;</span></p><p><span style="">He himself wasn&apos;t worrying about it. &#xA0;The fact that Melody was putting herself out there worrying for him was ridiculous. &#xA0;She became surprised when she realized she equated Alphen&apos;s peace with Kahng-woojin&apos;s well-being.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Isn&apos;t that hyung-nim coming toward us?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">At Sunggoo&apos;s words, everyone gathered under the matured World Tree looked up at the sky. &#xA0;The Phantom Steed was using its Phantom Gallop, and they could see Woojin on top of it. &#xA0;Latasha was being dragged along.</span></p><p><span style="">When they were almost at their destination, Latasha jumped down to land on her own. &#xA0;Woojin got off the Phantom Steed, and he looked at the Colony&apos;s symbol.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I&apos;m right on time.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">He&apos;ll have two gates on Alphen. &#xA0;The Dungeon will be protected by the defenders of the Dimensional Domains, and the Colony will be protected by the Coalition.</span></p><p><span style="">There was no way he would lose his way back home.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Did you accomplish what you set out to do?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin&apos;s eyebrow arched at Melody&apos;s question.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;It was well received by me.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Ah...&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">As she had surmised, he really went to steal a Holy Item.</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin took out the gloves as he shook it playfully. &#xA0;Melody closed her eyes when she saw it, and the other heroes frowned. &#xA0;Monk Tauric, who worshipped god Skia, couldn&apos;t help himself. &#xA0;He yelled out at Woojin.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;We are supposed to solidify our alliance, yet what is your motivation behind gathering the Holy Items?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I needed it.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;.....&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">The Immortal had committed theft, yet he was speaking in an imposing manner. &#xA0;It needled Tauric&apos;s feelings.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Are you covetous of god Skia&apos;s treasure?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I already have one.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;...&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;If I didn&apos;t have it, I would have asked for it.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">If one went by the tone of his words, it felt as if the Immortal was taking back something he had loaned out.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Now that we are talking about it...&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Kahng-woojin looked at Melody. &#xA0;Her eyes shook from uneasiness.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Why have I never seen Aria&apos;s Holy Item on you?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">He already possessed Thrash&apos;s Protection, which was the chest piece of the armor. It just needed to be repaired. &#xA0;Moreover, he had obtained the Ingredient Items for the gloves and boots. &#xA0;The only thing left was the helm and the belt.</span></p><p><span style="">He needed the Holy Items from goddess of prophecy Aria, and the god of time Heres. &#xA0;He was a bit puzzled at the fact that the Holy Maiden Melody didn&apos;t carry around her Holy Item. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">Her expression darkened as she spoke.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;After you took away my predecessor&apos;s Holy Item...&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">The Holy Item was given to the servant that was closest to the god. &#xA0;Whether it was a Holy Maiden, high priest or a monk, it was symbol of power given to the person that&apos;ll act as an avatar for the gods.</span></p><p><span style="">Melody was an acolyte of the previous Holy Maiden, who had her Holy Item stolen. &#xA0;Melody was the Holy Maiden now, but she was incomplete....</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;The high temple is in enemy territory. &#xA0;I wasn&apos;t fully able to complete the succession, so I do not have my Holy Item yet.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">She hadn&apos;t lost the item that symbolized her position as the Holy Maiden. &#xA0;She had never received it in the first place.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Well, I&apos;ll recover it.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;...&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">He&apos;ll recover the high temple then he&apos;ll take the Holy Item from her.</span></p><p><span style="">Kahng-woojin was in a good mood. &#xA0;It didn&apos;t matter how Melody felt about it. &#xA0;He needed the Items to make Thrash&apos;s Set. &#xA0;He was steadily gathering all the Items, and now he had completed a Colony.</span></p><p><span style="">Since he had his gates, he&apos;ll earnestly help in recovering Alphen, and he&apos;ll complete Thrash&apos;s Set Items.</span></p><p><span style="">The problem was the mysterious Thrash&apos;s Executioner, but he&apos;ll eventually find the answer to the problem.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I&apos;ll carry out the obligation I have towards the alliance.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin opened his Dimensional Store when his Colony was completed. &#xA0;The Saurus mountain underneath the World Tree was considered to be his territory. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;First, the walls...&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin purchased castle walls, and he started placing it around the perimeter of his territory.</span></p><p><span style="">Koo-koo-koohng!</span></p><p><span style="">As if by magic, castle walls emerged out of the ground as a barrier was formed. &#xA0;Everyone was in disbelief as they watched the miracle occurring in front of them.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I have organize the roads....&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">His Points were being quickly consumed, but he had saved up a lot from before. &#xA0;The more important part was the Bloodstones that would be gathered through taxes and selling Items at the stores. &#xA0;This could be seen as an investment.</span></p><p><span style="">He needed the Coalition to have a solid base, so they could protect the place. &#xA0;Moreover, he would be able to collect on taxes.</span></p><p><span style="">It was logical to prioritize making a stable Colony.</span></p><p><span style="">When the castle walls finished forming a perimeter, the grounds in various location were smoothed out. &#xA0;The space that would be used as drilling grounds and a square was formed. &#xA0;Then the roads started widening.</span></p><p><span style="">The trees disappeared and the boulders were moved. &#xA0;Houses were being made. &#xA0;Numerous facilities were being built, and in a short amount of time, a town came into being. &#xA0;Then several more towns were formed. &#xA0;Lookouts formed in various parts of the mountain where the troops would be stationed. &#xA0;He also made four Wyvern&apos;s Nests that&apos;ll protect the skies.</span></p><p><span style="">He had spent an incredible amount of Points, but he still had half his Points left.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Did I build all the basics?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">When he first decided to make Saurus mountain his Colony, everyone worried about supplies the most, but it wouldn&apos;t be a problem. &#xA0;They would be able to buy everything from the Colony city&apos;s stores using Bloodstones. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">He wasn&apos;t going to use this place as a shelter.</span></p><p><span style="">He wasn&apos;t planning on supporting a resistance that hid and ran away. &#xA0;This would be the launching pad of a counterattack. &#xA0;It didn&apos;t matter if they were visible to their enemies. &#xA0;The battle won&apos;t be conducted here. &#xA0;He was going to take the battlefield to his enemies.</span></p><p><span style="">After closing his Store, Woojin looked around his surrounding, and he saw that everyone was on their knees.</span></p><p><span style="">Jaemin and Sunggoo also had dumbfounded expression on their faces as they looked at Woojin.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;H....hyung-nim.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">In such a short amount of time, the Saurus mountain had changed in too many ways.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;God...&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin smirked when Jaemin mumbled the word.</span></p><p><span style="">If there was a god, it would be the being that made the Dimensional Stores. &#xA0;He was just someone that used it.</span></p><p><span style="">However, it seemed the natives of Alphen didn&apos;t share his views.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;What the are you guys doing?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin was dumbfounded when he saw the people on their knees with their head lowered.</span></p><p><span style="">He was most suited for destruction, yet the followers of gods, who were known for creation, was worshipping him.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Hey. &#xA0;Get up.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">They didn&apos;t dare raise their heads even at Woojin&apos;s words. &#xA0;He spoke in a low voice.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;If you don&apos;t want a beating, you guys should get up.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Yes.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">The heroes stood up as they eyed Woojin. &#xA0;This was especially true for Tauric, who had expressed his anger towards Woojin. &#xA0;Tauric didn&apos;t know what to do with himself.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;You are give me the creeps. &#xA0;Why are you suddenly being so shy?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I can&apos;t believe I was able to see the god of creation&apos;s miracle....&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin clicked his tongue as Tauric&apos;s words trailed away..</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;You don&apos;t know shit about miracles.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">If this was considered to be a miracle, wouldn&apos;t that mean the Dimensional lords of Trahnet were all gods? &#xA0;Woojin could act like a god only in a limited portion of this land, and his influence only extended to the Colony city below him.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Mmmm?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin was checking the status of the Colony city through his Information Window when a large portion of his Points was suddenly drained away. &#xA0;Half the Points of the Points he had left was used by someone.</span></p><p><span style="">There were only two other beings that could use the Points besides Woojin.</span></p><p><span style="">Bibi was in charge of the Colony city on earth, and there was Kiba, who was in charge of defending the Dimensional Domain.</span></p><p><span style="">A massive amount of Points were suddenly used, so it meant that most of his defenders had been be replenished.</span></p><p><span style="">Zzeeeeng.</span></p><p><span style="">Two gates opened up in front of the World Tree. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">One headed to his Dimensional Domain, and the other one headed towards the Colony on earth.</span></p><p><span style="">While Woojin was deciding where he should go, a person popped out from one of the portal.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Uh? &#xA0;King.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">A line of people were exiting the portal. &#xA0;It was none other than Che-haesol, Blanka and the Phantom Unit.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Is anything unusual going on? &#xA0;How&apos;s everything on earth?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Everything is fine. &#xA0;We came &#xA0;here as soon as the gate was activated.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">If the Colony on earth was safe, was the Points being used at the Dimensional Domain?</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Alright. &#xA0;You guys should greet everyone here, then go get ready for the mission.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Yes, sir.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin looked at Melody.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I&apos;m going to go visit my Domain for a little bit. &#xA0;I want you to settle the nearby locations with my men, and I want you to gather the Coalition.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Ah...&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">When Woojin entered the portal heading toward his Dimensional Domain, her heart beat faster at some unknown worry.</span></p><p><span style="">&apos;Please return safely.&apos;</span></p><p><span style="">Worry was squeezing her heart. &#xA0;The Holy Maiden was unsure if the worry was for Alphen or Kahng-woojin. &#xA0;She couldn&apos;t make out her feeling.</span></p>
