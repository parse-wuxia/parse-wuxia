Therefore, Woojin didn&#x2019;t need to borrow Sunggoo&#x2019;s money.</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin had been summoned to the Planet Alphen during his 3rd year of high school. No real estate contracts existed on that side. The locations he traveled to and where he fell asleep for the day was his home.</span></p><p><span style="">He lived like that for 20 years.</span></p><p><span style="">He had never made such a trifling contract like this. This was why Woojin didn&#x2019;t know what the intermediate payment and contract fee was.</span></p><p><span style="">While they were looking at the houses, the sun had long ago descended. They filled their hungry stomachs at a nearby restaurant, and Sooah was already sleeping from exhaustion.</span></p><p><span style="">He carried Sooah back home, and he laid her down. Lee-soogyong had a disappointed expression since she didn&#x2019;t want to part from her son.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Why don&#x2019;t you live with us until we move?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;No. However, we will have a place to live together soon.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin wanted to stay. He had looked forward to meeting his family for 20 years, so why wouldn&#x2019;t he want to? However, there were things he didn&#x2019;t want his family to see.</span></p><p><span style="">This was why he was trying to buy a house as fast as he could.</span></p><p><span style="">She couldn&#x2019;t force her uncomfortable son to sleep in the small house. She couldn&#x2019;t keep him here.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;All right. As soon as I quit working, I&#x2019;ll makes some banchan for the dongsaeng you live with.&#x201D; (TLN: banchan=korean side dish. dongsaeng=refer to younger sibling used in a general term to refer to Jaemin, gender neutral term)</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Eh-hem. It would build up my face a little bit.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">At her son&#x2019;s cheeky behavior, Lee-soongyong was able to banish a little bit of her unease from her heart. The fact that her son had returned was like a dream. However, consecutive dreamlike events were continuing to unfold in front of her.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I&#x2019;ll see you tomorrow. Please quit within couple days. If you are bored after sending Sooah to kindergarten, then I&#x2019;ll set up a cafe for you.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Uh-muh, son. I&#x2019;ll be happy if I&#x2019;m able to eat dinner with you and Sooah every night.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I feel the same way..&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin stroked Sooah&#x2019;s head as she slept. Then he stood up from where he sat.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I&#x2019;ll see you tomorrow, mother.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ok. I&#x2019;ll see you tomorrow, son.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin was sorry to have to say goodbye.</span></p><p><span style="">He headed towards Jaemin&#x2019;s house.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Whew. Still, I&#x2019;ve been fortunate.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin was harassed by an evil spirit every single night. This was why he couldn&#x2019;t sleep peacefully. He wanted to avoid it, but he couldn&#x2019;t since it was a curse.</span></p><p><span style="">Fortunately, a path opened up for him where he would be able to have some relief from the pain.</span></p><p><span style="">After walking for awhile, Woojin turned in to an unpopulated alleyway.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Come out, Bibi.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Whoosh.</span></p><p><span style="">At Woojin&#x2019;s call, a wind seemed to pick up, and a black smoke started to clump together. The black smoke seemed to coalesce then it scattered. This happened several times. The black smoke materialized then it scattered into some unknown place.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What the heck? Come out, Bibi.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Woosh.</span></p><p><span style="">The black smoke disappeared deeper into the alley way then it started to materialize in front of Woojin again. However, it was much smaller in size than before.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Nyahh.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The appearance of Bibi wasn&#x2019;t that of a small young demon. She looked like a cat. A very small young kitten.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What? What&#x2019;s wrong?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Nyahh. I couldn&#x2019;t materialize my body. I had no choice, but to search for a small creature-aohng.&#x201D; (TLN: korean sfx for cat is yah-ohng. Every time she ends a sentence with the second half of the cat sfx)</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin pressed his hand firmly on his temple.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Where is this place? I can&#x2019; feel any of Trahnet&#x2019;s influence-aohng.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin picked up Bibi.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Can you used your ability with that shape?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Nyahhng. Master is low level, so I am also low level-aohng. I can only use my Nightmare-ahong.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin&#x2019;s family also possessed levels. When Woojin had been transferred back, it seemed their levels were reset. Bibi was a low level succubus. However, it seemed her basic abilities like Nightmare wasn&#x2019;t tied to her materialized body.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;If you can use that then that will do.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Even if Bibi leveled up, Woojin didn&#x2019;t really need her abilities that&#x2019;ll show up later.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Nyahhng. It smells nice here. It&#x2019;s the smell of peace.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">She was a demon yet it seemed she was wishing for peace. He couldn&#x2019;t keep a wry smile off of his house from her words.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;This might be to my advantage. There won&#x2019;t be any problem if you live with me like this.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Is that so-nyahng? I can stay with master instead of waiting in the Summoning room-nyahong?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;All right. But you can&#x2019;t speak.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Nyahhng. I know at least much-nyahng. How would a cat be able to speak-aohng?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Bibi was quick on the uptake, so she&#x2019;ll be fine. Bibi was a big help when Woojin slept. Instead of suffering through the evil spirit&#x2019;s curse, he would rather have the nightmare. Was that too perverted? (TLN: preferring one pain over another)</span></p><p><span style="">Bibi was an important being to Woojin. If she was in her young demonic form, it would be a bit problematic if this situation was viewed through the morality of earth. However, she looked like a cat now, so it wouldn&#x2019;t be a problem. No one would care if he slept with a cat by his side.</span></p><p><span style="">Now that he thought about it Sooah wanted a dog&#x2026;&#x2026;.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hey. Can you change into a dog?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Nyaahng. The model for my materialization is already set, and I can&#x2019;t change it-aohng.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Mmmm&#x2026;.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Well, she might also like a cat.</span></p><p><span style="">*</span></p><p><span style="">After his tutoring school ended, Jaemin headed toward his home.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Uh, noonah. Please take care of yourself when you travel here. I&#x2019;ll meet you in front of my tutoring school.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Today was Friday. His sister was coming home tomorrow.</span></p><p><span style="">Ddi ddi ddi, ddi-rori!</span></p><p><span style="">When he opened the door, he instinctively put his guard up as he looked around his room. As expected, Woojin was sitting on the bed. He was watching the tv as he ate a tangerine.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hahaha. You are here?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Even though Jaemin had appeared, Woojin&#x2019;s gaze was still fixed on the television. If someone saw this scene, it would look like Woojin had lived here for a year. No, he acted so naturally that some would mistake him for Jaemin&#x2019;s brother.</span></p><p><span style="">Moreover, Woojin wasn&#x2019;t alone today.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hy&#x2026;hyung. What is that?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Jaemin pointed towards the cat with a surprised expression on his face. His finger was shaking.</span></p><p><span style="">Five hundred dollar was too large a sum, so he couldn&#x2019;t call him a trespasser&#x2026;</span></p><p><span style="">However, he was living off of me yet he brought home a pet!</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ah, I picked her up on my way here. I&#x2019;m going to keep her.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Huh huh. It&#x2019;s a cat. The fur, the fur, the smell, the smell&#x2026;.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Jaemin had a dejected expression on his face. He feebly took off his shoes, then he took off his bag. He opened the refrigerator, then he chugged down some water.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;This can&#x2019;t happen.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">His sister was coming tomorrow. His sister had provided this precious one-room, so he would be able focus entirely on his studies. He was already unhappy by the fact that a man was in his room yet this person brought a pet without the owner&#x2019;s consent.</span></p><p><span style="">His action had crossed the line this time. He had to regain his identity as the owner of this house. Jaemin placed the empty water cup on the dinner table. He brought it down hard enough that a &#x2018;tahk&apos;(TLN: sfx) was heard.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hyung!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Uh. I placed some more rent money on top of the dinner table. Haha. This is so funny.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;&#x2026;.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin went back to watching the tv. Jaemin peeked inside the envelope on top of the dinner table.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Th&#x2026;th&#x2026;three hundred?&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">At the unexpected large sum of money, Jaemin&#x2019;s eyes turned round. How could he have so much money? Jaemin&#x2019;s gaze headed toward Woojin once more.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;JaehoonJaehoon. Can you buy me this? Pooh-hee-hee.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">When he looked at Woojin, who was immersed in watching the tv, he looked like a poor neighborhood bum. Even though he was an unemployed hyung, it seemed he had some money. He must have been born with a golden spoon. (TLN: born into a rich family)</span></p><p><span style="">No, how could such a wastrel of a golden spoon exist?</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Nyahh.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The cat next to Woojin was eating the tangerine with him&#x2026; Uh? The cat ate the tangerine?</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Why are you standing there like that? Come here and have some tangerine. It&#x2019;s really delicious.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The Planet Alphen only had apple trees. It didn&#x2019;t have any tangerine trees. Woojin had always liked tangerine, and quite a few places sold it on every street he visited. So he bought it whenever he saw the tangerines.</span></p><p><span style="">Jaemin didn&#x2019;t say anything as he sat next to Woojin.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ah, this is so funny.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The comedy program&#x2019;s sketch ended. Woojin finally looked away from the tv, then he turned to look at Jaemin.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;JaeminJaemin. Why? Why the long face? JaeminJaemin.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Why does this hyung enjoy life so much? It made Jaemin look like the abnormal one, since he lived with so much worry.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;JaeminJaemin. Do you need spending money? JaeminJaemin.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;&#x2026;.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin took out his wallet. Jaemin took out his handphone when he saw the $50 in Woojin&#x2019;s hand. Then he started writing a message to his noonah through KaTalk.(TLN: Kakao Talk = very popular Korean Mobile messenger app, free text/call )</span></p><p><span style="">[Noonah. I think noonah will have to sleep in a hotel tomorrow&#x2026;]</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;JaeminJaemin. Take this pocket money. JaeminJaemin.&#x201D; (TLN: He is speaking like this b/c he is copying the punchline to the joke he heard on tv)</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Thank you. What is the cat&#x2019;s name, hyung? It is quite beautiful.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Jaemin&#x2019;s voice turned gentle like a spring weather melting snow.</span></p><p><span style="">*</span></p><p><span style="">Hweeek.</span></p><p><span style="">Sunggoo whistled. Even if he was standing still, his shoulders felt like it was about to dance by itself.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hee-yah. I can&#x2019;t believe this is my car.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">BMW 5 series.</span></p><p><span style="">He could have spent more, but he had thought about the entrance fee to the 4 star Dungeon. He left enough cash in reserve.</span></p><p><span style="">When he visited the sales office to sign the contract, he had been quite nervous. He was about pay a lump sum for the contract, but Woojin had called him to borrow his money. It made him want to cry.</span></p><p><span style="">Eventually he said to sign a contract on an installment plan for 60 month, and his car was delivered to him today.</span></p><p><span style="">When the tinting was done, it was already 12 o&#x2019;clock.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hehe, Vroom-vroom.(TLN:This is what he named the car) Should we go on a drive?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Hong-sunggoo. 21 years old. This was the first car he had purchased in his life, so his affection for the car was extraordinary. His car was much better than what his friends had. No, there weren&#x2019;t that many friends who even owned a car.</span></p><p><span style="">Boo-ooh-oong.</span></p><p><span style="">The car&#x2019;s power and handle couldn&#x2019;t even be compared to the Matiz. It elevated Sunggoo&#x2019;s mood. He had returned home to eat lunch with his parents, and it was already 2 o&#x2019;clock now.</span></p><p><span style="">It was time to pickup Woojin.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Shall we go full force?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin was a scary Roused, who could extract $400,000 from the 3 star Dungeon. Normally, the 3 star Dungeon yielded around $50,000 per run. He wondered how much the 4 star Dungeons would give&#x2026;.</span></p><p><span style="">For Sunggoo, Woojin was basically a lotto ticket for him.</span></p><p><span style="">[Oppa bought a car. I&#x2019;ll go get you~]</span></p><p><span style="">Sungoo sang at top volume as he headed towards the Sadahng station.</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin received a call from Sunggoo, and his eyes turned round when he went outside.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Eeeyah. You bought this car?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Haha. It troubled me that hyung-nim had to ride in the small Matiz. This is why I bought this car.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Oh yeah. You don&#x2019;t have to lend me your money.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I decided to settle the balance in a fortnight.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;&#x2026;.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">He had signed a contract for a 60 month installed payment plan because of him&#x2026;. He could have told him a little bit sooner.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;That&#x2019;s too bad. If it is for hyung-nim, it would be well worth it even if you spend my entire fortune.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin was used to Sunggoo&#x2019;s brown-nosing, so he let it flow over him as he looked at the car.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Wow. This car is great.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin sat in the passenger seat. As if he was amazed by the car, he started touching every inch of the car&#x2019;s interior. Sunggoo, who was the car&#x2019;s owner, looked on with nervousness.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Ah. The oil from his hands.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">He couldn&#x2019;t say anything, and he put on a smile. However, his inside were burning to pitch black. Woojin still pressed against various parts of the car as if he was fascinated by it.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Noooo!&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">Sunggoo was letting out a anguished scream inside. However, Woojin&#x2019;s hand didn&#x2019;t stop as his eyes was filled with curiosity.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What are you doing? Aren&#x2019;t you going to start the car?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;Yes.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The car would eventually become dirty. New cars became used cars. Children became adults. This was the law of nature. Sunggoo chanted a Buddhist prayer as he tried to take care of his mental health by himself.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;When is the appointment?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;It&#x2019;s 5 o&#x2019;clock.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">He had already put down the appointment fee, so they could use a the Dungeon. They didn&#x2019;t have to go early to line up. They just had to make an appointment. It was a popular Dungeon, so the entire week was packed with appointments.</span></p><p><span style="">No one knew when the Dungeon Reset would happen, so they only took appointments for one week at a time.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Where are we going this time?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;We are headed to the Gwachun Station&#x2019;s 6th exit.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Uh? It was near his high school.</span></p><p><span style="">In the beginning, Woojin had gone into the Gwachun Station&#x2019;s 1st exit by mistake. He grinned as he thought about it.</span></p><p><span style="">The two rode the new car, and they headed towards Gwachun.</span></p><p></p></div><p></p>
