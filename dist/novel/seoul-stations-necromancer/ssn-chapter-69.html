It stinks&#x2026; What happened?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin pinched his nose then he took a step back.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Uh-whew. He made a mess.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">After Haemin looked into the back seat of the car, he shook his head.</span></p><p><span style="">Soonghoon was still asleep, but the smoothie inside his intestines was warming up inside of Sunggoo&#x2019;s car.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I&#x2019;ve called for a chauffeur service, president. Let&#x2019;s go to the main road.&#x201D; (TLN: can hire someone to drive your car for $$)</span></p><p><span style="">Jung-minchan was always quick to act. He looked at Woojin after he finished making a call for a car.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;All right. Everyone won&#x2019;t be able to fit inside the car&#x2026; I&#x2019;ll just take a taxi. I&#x2019;ll see you tomorrow, Sunggoo.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I&#x2019;ll see you tomorrow, director Hong.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Please take good care of Mr. Soonghoon.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin, Minchan and Haemin left side by side. Sunggoo looked at the back seat with tears in his eyes.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hoo-hook. I&#x2019;m sorry&#x2026; Hoo-hook..&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">He didn&#x2019;t know if Soonghoon was in a drunken stupor or he was talking in his sleep. Sunggoo felt sorry for him, and he also felt annoyed&#x2026;.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;My Boongboong&#x2026; Boongboong&#x2026;.&#x201D; (TLN: nickname for car)</span></p><p><span style="">It hadn&#x2019;t been too long since he took out this car yet it was already in this state.</span></p><p><span style="">Sunggoo held back his tears as he waited for the chauffeur to come.</span></p><p><span style="">*</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin got off on the main road in front of his house.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I&#x2019;ll see you tomorrow.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes, president. Please head on in.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin waved his hand then he walked into an alley. When he checked there weren&#x2019;t any people around, he called out Bibi. The black smoke coalesced, and a figure of a cat solidified on top of Woojin&#x2019;s shoulder.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Nyahng. We are already home-nahong?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">When Woojin&#x2019;s familiar was inside the Summoning room, they shared his sight and senses. From Bibi&#x2019;s perspective, it was better for her to stay inside the Summoning room instead of the house. She didn&#x2019;t like being separated from Woojin.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Why? Are you worried?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ha. I am worried-ahong.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin laughed as he picked up Bibi from his shoulder, then he held her against his chest.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Sooah should be close to the dog now.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Originally, Sooah had wanted a dog. She might leave Bibi alone now.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;The secret code this time is&#x2026;&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin found the memo inside his hand phone, then he pressed the secret password to the front door.</span></p><p><span style="">Ddi ddi ddi, ddi-ri-reek!</span></p><p><span style="">After returning home, the first one to greet Woojin was the dog. He came running towards Woojiin.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Wal, wal! Koo-rooh-roong.&#x201D; (TLN: bark bark growl)</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Uh?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">He had been only gone for several days, but the dog had grown a lot. Woojin flicked his finger on the dog&#x2019;s forehead.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;He&#x2019;s showing teeth after not seeing me for only several days.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin lifted the fairly large dog, then he looked into the dog&#x2019;s eyes. He glared into the dog&#x2019;s eyes, and his eyes shook. The dog couldn&#x2019;t maintain eye contact, so he turned his gaze away.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ggoo-oohng, ggoo-oohng.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Sooah was the one to rescue the whining dog.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Mom! Oppa is here.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Sooah bounded towards him. Woojin let go of the dog, and he opened both his arms wide.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Aigo. My Sooah missed oppa?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yeah.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">After she gave a brief hug, she immediately went towards Bibi. She quickly grabbed Bibi into her grasp.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hey, Bibi. Didn&#x2019;t you miss unni?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;&#x2026;.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Nyahng?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Instead of forgetting Bibi, her absence must have fostered Sooah&#x2019;s yearning for Bibi.</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin let out a bitter laugh. Bibi sent a gaze asking for salvation towards Woojin.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;You don&#x2019;t like playing with the dog?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I play with Bokhwee, but I like Bibi better.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;Bokhwee is his name?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Oohng!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">After she spoke in a bright manner, she ran into the living room, while she hugged Bibi. Then she searched for her laser pointer. His mother showed up around that time.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;You are here, Woojin?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes, mother.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Let&#x2019;s talk for a little bit.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin followed his mother into the kitchen. After he sat near the small dining table, his mother took out some water from the fridge. She placed the water in font of Woojin.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Did you drink alcohol?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ok. Did you meet the president?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;No. I was at a company dinner.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">It seemed the news said he was heading towards the Cheongwadae immediately after he returned from North Korea. Woojin felt a bit awkward, so he changed the topic.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I&#x2019;ll meet the president soon. So why isn&#x2019;t Sooah asleep yet?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The company dinner wrapped up early, but it was already 11 pm.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;It&#x2019;s Saturday tomorrow. She said she&#x2019;ll sleep after seeing her oppa.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Mmmm.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">If that was true, then why was she playing only with Bibi?</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Sooah still feels very awkward around you. You should be mindful of that.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;&#x2026;.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">While she played with Bibi, Sooah kept sneaking glances towards the kitchen.</span></p><p><span style="">Now that he thought about it he had memories of Sooah when she was a baby. However, Sooah didn&#x2019;t have any memories of him. She had suddenly gained an oppa, but the oppa didn&#x2019;t come home regularly&#x2026;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Mmm. Should we go on a family trip?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I&#x2019;m not saying this to steal time away from my busy son.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin suddenly felt embarrassed at his mother&#x2019;s words.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Sooah&#x2019;s been sick a lot in the past. The hospital says she is doing fine, but she occasionally develops the same symptoms as before.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Even though Woojin and his father had disappeared, Soohah&#x2019;s hospital fees were a big reason why their household&#x2019;s wealth had diminished so quickly.</span></p><p><span style="">When Woojin started raiding the Dungeons, she had the money to purchase almost everything she wanted.</span></p><p><span style="">This was why Lee-soogyung went back to the hospital to treat her daughter&#x2019;s ailments. In the past, she couldn&#x2019;t afford to treat Sooah. However, contrary to her expectation, the hospital test result gave Sooah a clean bill of health.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;She is so young, and when she occasionally has a seizure, mother&#x2019;s heart is&#x2026;.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">When his mother&#x2019;s eyes started to become moist, Woojin&#x2019;s heart became heavy.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;The child is sick, but the hospital keeps saying nothing is wrong with her. I was so frustrated that I even visited a shaman not too long ago. The shaman said she was inhabited by ghosts.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Eh-ee. She doesn&#x2019;t have any ghosts sticking to her.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The one with ghosts was Woojin. There weren&#x2019;t any evil spirits within the vicinity of Sooah.</span></p><p><span style="">Moreover, he had been very careful since he worried about his evil spirits sticking to his family. Even when they lived in a single room, Woojin tried to minimize the time he spent with them.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;How would you know about such things?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">How should he answer the question when she asked how he knew this&#x2026; Mother. Your son is an expert about ghosts.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Even though I knew the shaman was trying to bewitch me, her words still made me wonder.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Eh-ee. The shaman sounds like a fraud&#x2026;.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I&#x2019;m saying this, because I&#x2019;m upset. I can&#x2019;t even support my son who is doing big things. Please look in on your only sibling once in awhile.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Lee-soogyung saw Kahng-woojin appear daily on the television, so she knew he was busy.</span></p><p><span style="">Didn&#x2019;t he succeed in pulling off some big job in North Korea?</span></p><p><span style="">She didn&#x2019;t want Woojin to worry about the problems within the household. She wanted him to focus on his outside work, but this was about Sooah. Sooah&#x2019;s illness was beyond her power.</span></p><p><span style="">The child was hurting yet there weren&#x2019;t any solutions. She was barely able to put the issue out in the open as she had continued to internalize the pain she had felt.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I&#x2019;ll pay a little more attention to her.. I&#x2019;m sorry, mother.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin tightly hugged the sniffling Lee-soohgyung.</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin went towards the living room, and he spent some time with Sooah. The cat acted as a bridge as he played with Sooah. There weren&#x2019;t any awkwardness as they played, and they had a fun time.</span></p><p><span style="">It was getting late, so his mother took Sooah, who had wanted to play more. Only Woojin, Bibi and Bokhwee was left in the living room.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Koon koong, koong.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Bohkhwee was having a hard time calming himself after running and playing around. His nose twitched, and he rubbed his head on Bibi.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Nyahng! Go away-ahong.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Puhk.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ggeeeng.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Bibi swung her front paw. Bokhwee ran away after he was hit on the head.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Nyahng. Let&#x2019;s go bring a new cat-ahong. I&#x2019;d rather kill monsters. This is too hard-ahong.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;You just have to play with her for a brief amount of time. What&#x2019;s so bad about it?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Nyahng. It&#x2019;s more about me pretending to be a cat. It&#x2019;s very taxing-ahong.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2026;so, that&#x2019;s what stressed her out. Woojin also put on a serious expression.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Please endure it for a little bit more.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Nyahng. I understand-ahong.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Then stay a home for a while. You should keep a close watch on Sooah to see if any evil spirits approach her.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">He didn&#x2019;t think Sooah was being tormented by an evil spirit, but since his mother had said it, he was leery of dismissing her claim. He thought about attaching Ggaebi on Sooah, but he was still a low level Shadow. He could have a bad influence on the host.</span></p><p><span style="">As of right now, Bibi was the best option.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;The child&#x2019;s soul is strong-ahong. A mere evil spirit won&#x2019;t be able to latch on to her-ahong.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;You should stay with her just in case.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Understood-ahong.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Bibi was his familiar, so she could feel Woojin&#x2019;s emotions. She knew how precious his family was to Woojin.</span></p><p><span style="">Bibi followed Woojin into his room.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ggeeng. Ggeeng.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Bokhwee was the only one left in the hall way, and he looked around nervously at the dark corridor. After a moment, the door to Woojin&#x2019;s room opened slightly, and Bibi walked out into the hallway.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Nyahng. You may come in here-ahong.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Bokhwee wagged his tail as he followed Bibi into Woojin&#x2019;s room, and he laid down at the foot of the bed.</span></p><p><span style="">*</span></p><p><span style="">It was Saturday, but Woojin came early to the office.</span></p><p><span style="">His mother was curious about Do-jiwon, so they had made an appointment for lunch. In the evening, they had promised to meet the high school friends they were able to contact. Before all of this, he had some work he had to finish at the office.</span></p><p><span style="">Since it was Saturday, the new employees didn&#x2019;t come to the office. The founding members had come to work at an earlier time, and they were waiting for Woojin.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;You are here?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Where&#x2019;s Haemin?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;He&#x2019;s inside the storage room.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Let&#x2019;s head over there.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Minchan received an order from Woojin to buyout the floor. Minchan paid a premium to clear out the other offices on the floor, and he made contracts for the other office spaces. The current office they had was getting too cramped, and this also resolved the problem of security.</span></p><p><span style="">They decided to use a roughly 1800 square feet space as the office for housing the sales department, and a storage room for the Artifacts.</span></p><p><span style="">The storage room held a small amount of Artifacts that wouldn&#x2019;t even fill up a 1 ton truck. Moreover, the normal items and large ingredients made up most of the pile.</span></p><p><span style="">In the first place, Alandal had only two Roused, Woojin and Sunggoo. It was inevitable for the collection to be small.</span></p><p><span style="">The drop rate for Artifacts were high only for the first clear of a Dungeon, so even if they had a low number of Roused, the guild possessed a relatively numerous amount of Artifacts.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Are you a bit sober now?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;I&#x2019;m deeply ashamed.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Woo-soonghoon was still hungover. He lowered his head .</span></p><p><span style="">It seemed Minchan and Haemin had been hardened by company life. Their faces were fine. Sunggoo&#x2019;s body couldn&#x2019;t&#x2019; be compared to before, so he looked fresh.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I guess I&#x2019;ll take it out now?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes, sir.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Everyone looked at Woojin with anticipation in their eyes. Woojin opened his inventory, and he started taking out Kim-jungun&#x2019;s collection.</span></p><p><span style="">Kim-jungun wasn&#x2019;t a Roused, but he had gathered a lot of Artifacts and Skill books. Woojin had run out of Inventory space, so he had to waste a lot of Achievement Points to add additional slots.</span></p><p><span style="">It was as if Woojin was snatching items out of empty air. The items started pouring on to the floor like piles of clothes one saw in the market.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;&#x2026;.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The amount of items far outstripped what one could earn clearing a Dungeon several times. Everyone&#x2019;s mouth fell open in shock.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What are you guys doing? Start sorting it out.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Sort out the item we&#x2019;ll be able to sell on the market. Then sort out the stolen goods we&#x2019;ll have to fence.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2026;president actually acknowledged these were stolen goods.</span></p><p><span style="">He would have been put in an awkward situation if Woojin unreasonably demanded him to sell all these items on the market for money. Minchan was thankful towards Woojin.</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin poured out a lot of Artifacts, and it filled up an entire section of the storage room. They would need three 1 ton trucks to move it.</span></p><p><span style="">At Minchan&#x2019;s direction, everyone started sorting the Artifacts.</span></p><p><span style="">The basic ingredients and Skill books that existed in high quantity wasn&#x2019;t of much interest. They looked for items with unique shapes and unique abilities.</span></p><p><span style="">Basically, they made a separate pile for items people would recognize where it came from just by looking at it.</span></p><p><span style="">There were some unique items with low value, but most of the times were high performance Artifacts. There were 10 Artifacts that would conservatively sell for 10 to 20 million dollars.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I guess I&#x2019;ll use these.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">He took a pair of earrings. It wouldn&#x2019;t be very noticeable even if he wore it. Then he put the rest of the Artifacts into his inventory.</span></p><p><span style="">He opened his Advanced Skill, then he put all the Artifacts into the [Combination Box]. At the bottom, there were two options. The [Combine] button was off, and the [Extract] button started blinking brightly.</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin didn&#x2019;t hesitate to press the [Extract] button.</span></p><p></p></div><p></p>
