<p><span style="">Chapter 166 - Entry into Alphen (1)&#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">In a nameless abandoned temple....</span></p><p><span style="">There were several pillars at this location, and it was overgrown with weeds. &#xA0;Then there were the ancillary stone fragments that used to decorate the temple. &#xA0;People started coming out from between these pillars one by one.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Hoo-ooh-oohp.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">After taking a deep breath, none other than Kahng-woojin appeared.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;It&apos;s been a while.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin had purchased the &apos;Rhat&apos;s Temple.&apos; &#xA0;It was located on top of a mountain, and there was nothing obstructing one&apos;s view. &#xA0;&#xA0;One could see miles around. &#xA0;Of course, the view wasn&apos;t that great.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Ooh ooh. &#xA0;This place is Alphen?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;This place looks too desolate.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Sunggoo and Jaemin had appeared behind Woojin. &#xA0;They frowned as they looked at their surrounding. &#xA0;The mountain was patchy with burnt trees. &#xA0;There were bones and corpses that one couldn&apos;t distinguish if it was from animals or monsters. &#xA0;There was a horrible stench in the air.</span></p><p><span style="">There were quite a few fresh looking corpses amongst the dead.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I guess they fought each other to be the ones to enter my Dungeon.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">When the abandoned Raht&apos;s Temple was purchased by Woojin, a Dungeon Reset would have occurred.</span></p><p><span style="">If there was no rule in determining the order in which one could attempt the Dungeon, strength would determine the order. &#xA0;It looked as if a big fight had gone on here to resolve this issue.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;....&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Melody was the last to come through. &#xA0;She swallowed a moan when she saw the terrible sight around her.</span></p><p><span style="">The entrance was collapsed, so it was hard to see where the entrance to the Dungeon was. &#xA0;He left behind his temple as he asked Melody a question.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Where do you think we are?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I believe we are west of the Raht&apos;s Plateau.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;...&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">When Woojin didn&apos;t say anything, she studied his face. &#xA0;He spoke with a sour expression on his face.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;How would I know where that is? &#xA0;Where will I be able to find the coalition?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Ah... &#xA0;If we head northeast, we&apos;ll be at the old Alandal. &#xA0;If we go east, we&apos;ll arrive at the lands owned by the coalition. &#xA0;I&apos;m not sure what has happened to them, but....&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;All right. &#xA0;Let&apos;s go and check them out.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin turned to look at Sunggoo and Jaemin.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Both of you can fly?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Yes, hyung-nim.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Yes, hyung.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">After he heard their answers, Woojin summoned Shing Shing, and he got on.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;What are you doing? &#xA0;Come here.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;What? Yes..&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Melody was taken back at Woojin&apos;s out of character offer. &#xA0;She grabbed his hand, and she got on Shing Shing.</span></p><p><span style="">Heeeeeng!</span></p><p><span style="">Shing Shing didn&apos;t like the Holy Maiden being on it, so it let out a rough snort. &#xA0;However, it didn&apos;t do anything rash.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;After we look around Alandal, we can go to the coalition lands..&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">He didn&apos;t know if Alandal remained or if it was destroyed. &#xA0;However, he would have to check up on it with his own eyes. &#xA0;He&apos;ll have to check to see if a Colony could be formed there.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Oh yeah. &#xA0;Before I do that...&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">There were welcome presents all around for his return to Alphen. &#xA0;He couldn&apos;t just leave them behind.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Wake up!&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Chwahhhhhhk!</span></p><p><span style="">Magical energy flowed out of Woojin&apos;s body, and it swirled around the corpses nearby. &#xA0;The corpses were raised as Undeads.</span></p><p><span style="">Goo-uh-uh-uh!</span></p><p><span style="">The ones that looked mobile were brought back as Zombies. &#xA0;The rest were returned as Skeleton Warriors.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Let&apos;s go.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Shing Shing ran across the sky. &#xA0;Sunggoo gave his body to the burning flame, and he flew across the sky like a rocket. &#xA0;Jaemin chased after them after morphing into a bat.</span></p><p><span style="">In a flash, several hundred Undead had been created, and they madly dashed after Woojin.</span></p><p><span style="">Shing Shing was running at frightening speed, and Melody was afraid she would fall off the Phantom Steed. &#xA0;She grabbed Woojin&apos;s waist tighter.</span></p><p><span style="">***</span></p><p><span style="">The enormous praying mantises, Vesics, were chasing after the people.</span></p><p><span style="">Keh-roohk!</span></p><p><span style="">They were dripping poisonous spit from their mouths as they tirelessly moved their legs. &#xA0;If the Vesics caught up to the humans, it meant death to the group.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Muster up your energy!&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">The leader was a big and strong man. &#xA0;He yelled out loudly. &#xA0;He was taking up the rear most position of the group that was running away.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Hoo-ahhhp!&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">The bald heroic man held a mace in his hand. &#xA0;He swung it to break open the heads of the Vesics. &#xA0;He had killed three with a single blow when one jumped high into the sky.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Look above, Tauric-nim!&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">At the girl&apos;s shout, Tauric reflexively swung his mace. &#xA0;He was able to strike the body of the Vesic. &#xA0;The scythe-like appendage grazed across his head.</span></p><p><span style="">A shallow wound formed as a thin red line appeared on his bald head. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Jeez! &#xA0;Hurry up and run away!&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Tauric turned his body to increase his speed. &#xA0;He grabbed his bald head with the hand that wasn&apos;t holding the mace.</span></p><p><span style="">Ooh-ooh-oohng.</span></p><p><span style="">Accompanying a pure light, the wound on his head was completely healed. &#xA0;When one of the girl that couldn&apos;t keep up with the group fell down, he ran while holding her by his side.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Hoo-oohk, Tauric-nim.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Don&apos;t cry, my child.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Wooooooong.</span></p><p><span style="">The light flowed out of Tauric&apos;s body, and it surrounded the twenty people that was running in front of him.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Muster up your energy!&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">They ran as if their lives were on the line. &#xA0;They had to live. &#xA0;Strength returned to their shaking legs. &#xA0;Each of the adults were holding one or two children. &#xA0;They hugged the children tighter as if they cherished them more.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Are we going to die?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">At the little girl&apos;s question, Tauric put on a smile that was always overflowing with energy.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Don&apos;t worry! &#xA0;We just have to survive as we sincerely hope for a miracle. &#xA0;It will happen.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Hoo-hoohk. &#xA0;Yes! &#xA0;I can run by myself now.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Tauric put down the girl as he ran. &#xA0;The girl quickly caught up to the back of the running adults.</span></p><p><span style="">There were 20 Vesics chasing after them.</span></p><p><span style="">More would gather at this location when they heard the sound of the pursuit. &#xA0;However, the only thing they could do right now was to fight and run at the same time. &#xA0;The people that were running right now were all that was left of their village.</span></p><p><span style="">If they wanted to fight, they could. &#xA0;However, the children would be killed or injured if they did so. &#xA0;Even if it was a tough task, Tauric would whittle down the number of Vesics chasing them from the rear.</span></p><p><span style="">Kwahng, kwah-jeek!</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;What tenacious bastards!&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">A Vesic died every time Tauric swung his mace. &#xA0;If he was injured, he healed himself. &#xA0;After killing two Vesics, he was about to run again when his eyes turned round.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Huh? Why did you stop...&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">The people in front of him had stopped running. &#xA0;When he joined the group, he didn&apos;t even have to ask the question. &#xA0;There were 12 spider-like monsters with tentacles called Launchers in front of them.</span></p><p><span style="">Keh-eh-ehk!</span></p><p><span style="">The Vesics finally caught up to them, and they surrounded the group of humans.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Tauric-nim...&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Everyone&apos;s faces were filled with despair. &#xA0;The adults put down the children, and they grabbed the weapons on their waist. &#xA0;They had no choice, but to fight even if they would most likely be wiped out.</span></p><p><span style="">No, they wouldn&apos;t all be wiped out.</span></p><p><span style="">Monk Tauric, who served the god Skia, wouldn&apos;t die.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Oh Skia...&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Tauric spoke a quiet prayer as he grabbed his mace.</span></p><p><span style="">At that moment, he wasn&apos;t swept up by despair. &#xA0;He had travelled too hard of a road to give up now.</span></p><p><span style="">His muscles expanded as the clothes on his body billowed around him.</span></p><p><span style="">In a battle, he couldn&apos;t protect everyone. &#xA0;Children would die in this battle, and sadness would seek him out afterwards.</span></p><p><span style="">He decided to use his Rage, so he could pre-emptively strike fear into the enemies.</span></p><p><span style="">Hooooooohng.</span></p><p><span style="">A radiant pink light surrounded Tauric&apos;s body.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Tauric-nim! &#xA0;Look over there!&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">At that moment, the girl let out a shout.</span></p><p><span style="">Hwahhhhhhng.</span></p><p><span style="">A fireball was falling from the sky. &#xA0;It was heading for the spider monsters called Launchers.</span></p><p><span style="">Kwahhhhng!</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Huh?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Tauric&apos;s eyes widened in surprise.</span></p><p><span style="">Shwehhhhhhk! &#xA0;Kwah-jeek!</span></p><p><span style="">An arrow pierced through the Vesic that had charged forward. &#xA0;Tauric turned his gaze towards where the arrow had come from.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Oh, my god...&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">There were only few heroes left in this world.</span></p><p><span style="">These were the heroes of the coalition. &#xA0;They were the last hope of this land, and they were gathered to collect the Dimensional Fragments from the bases of their enemies.</span></p><p><span style="">Mage Graham and the Elven Lady Latasha appeared.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;We are saved!&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;It&apos;s Graham-nim!&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;It&apos;s the Silver Arrow!&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Some in the group had fought alongside these heroes in battle, so they cheered when they recognized the two.</span></p><p><span style="">When the two group joined forces, the Vesics and Launchers were defeated in an instant.</span></p><p><span style="">Tauric greeted them with a happy face.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;You were right on time! &#xA0;Well met!&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;You&apos;ve done a good job. &#xA0;What happened to the town?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Tauric shook his head from side to side at Graham&apos;s question. &#xA0;The hidden village had been found, and destroyed. &#xA0;Most of the villagers had died. &#xA0;The thirty people here were all that was left.</span></p><p><span style="">Moreover, half of them were children.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Shit! &#xA0;Those Vesic bastards are everywhere now.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">The beautiful Elf Latasha had a delicate face, but she let out a string of cuss words. &#xA0;Her forest had been destroyed, and there were no longer any Elves that prohibited themselves from taking life on this planet.</span></p><p><span style="">Only the warriors were able to live.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;What happened to the rest of your party that went to attack the Go-shoo-shoo colony?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Graham shook his head from side to side at Tauric&apos;s question.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;We failed to clear it. &#xA0;The rest of our members have dispersed to save as many people as possible.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Mmmm...&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">The news only held despair. &#xA0;Tauric&apos;s face darkened.</span></p><p><span style="">Go-shoo-shoo was the Dimensional lord that had newly built a colony city in this region. &#xA0;The monsters that lived in this Domain was massing in numbers, and they were encroaching on the surrounding territories.</span></p><p><span style="">If the bastard&apos;s colony was destroyed, they would be able to stop the proliferation of the monsters. &#xA0;It would give them some room to breathe. &#xA0;However, they had failed. &#xA0;They would have to abandon this land to find a new place to live.</span></p><p><span style="">The attack hadn&apos;t just happened at the town where Tauric was in residence. &#xA0;Other towns had all been attacked, and the heroes decided to go in twos and threes to save the towns.</span></p><p><span style="">Kieeeehhhk!</span></p><p><span style="">At that moment, a large life form appeared in the air as it let out a long screech.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Shit! &#xA0;It&apos;s a Feris!&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">It was a massive stingray that could fly through the sky.</span></p><p><span style="">It was large enough to blot out the sun if it flew over you. &#xA0;In terms of size, it was a flying monster that rivalled the size of a Dragon. &#xA0;The true reason why everyone was afraid of this monster was the fact that it acted as a carrier for other monsters.</span></p><p><span style="">Shoo-shoo-shoohk.</span></p><p><span style="">Vesics were on top of the Feris. &#xA0;The Vesics unfurled their dragonfly-like wings as they flooded down from the skies.</span></p><p><span style="">Doo-doo-doo-doo.</span></p><p><span style="">These weren&apos;t the only monsters. &#xA0;The ground shook around them as the mole monsters named Tudon pushed their heads out of the ground. &#xA0;The Tudons were coming up all around them.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Hah. &#xA0;It seems the offensive capability of Go-shoo-shoo&apos;s army is beyond imagination.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Tauric, Graham and Latasha&apos;s faces darkened at the overwhelming number of monsters. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">They could run away, but if they did, thirty people would die. &#xA0;Even if they fought, they couldn&apos;t guarantee the lives of the people.</span></p><p><span style="">The most devastating part was that these children could become heroes and archmages in the future. &#xA0;The lives of these children would be snuffed out, and it would have been all for naught.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Let&apos;s retreat.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Graham nodded his head at Latasha&apos;s words. &#xA0;Monk Tauric held his mouth firmly shut. &#xA0;Tauric was about to open his mouth when he felt a delicate touch on his rough hand.</span></p><p><span style="">A child had grabbed his hand, and she was looking up at him with tear-filled eyes.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Are we going to die?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;...&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Is there no miracles left?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;...&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">It was as if the child, who was close to tears, knew what her future held. &#xA0;Tauric turned to look at his companions.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Let&apos;s fight.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;That&apos;s unreasonable.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Then the two of you may escape to safety. &#xA0;I&apos;ll do my best to save these people..&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Graham spoke with great care at Tauric&apos;s words.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;You are Skia&apos;s Monk. &#xA0;You shouldn&apos;t recklessly use your body like this. &#xA0;You have bigger tasks to accomplish in the future. &#xA0;I can&apos;t let you die in vain.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Tauric&apos;s power wasn&apos;t weak.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;It is my mission to save the lives of the children. &#xA0;There is nothing more important than that.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Huh...&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Graham shook his head from side to side at Tauric&apos;s stubbornness. &#xA0;To make matters worse, two more Feris had appeared, and the Vesics were jumping off of them too.</span></p><p><span style="">The sky was covered with the praying mantis monsters. &#xA0;It wasn&apos;t a beautiful sight.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;If dying in this place was arranged by Skiah-nim, I will not refuse it.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Tauric was firm in his words. &#xA0;At his words, Graham raised his staff.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I guess we have no choice then.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Tauric was someone the survivors of Alphen needed. &#xA0;He was essential to them. &#xA0;The Holy Maiden was gone now. &#xA0;There was no hero that was as well versed in Healing magic as Tauric.</span></p><p><span style="">He had no choice, but to help the Monk.</span></p><p><span style="">If they wanted to run away after defeating this swarm of monsters, this was their last chance. &#xA0;They had to do it before the Dimensional lord Go-shoo-shoo made an appearance.</span></p><p><span style="">Hwah-roo-roohk.</span></p><p><span style="">They were getting ready for battle when something extraordinary occurred.</span></p><p><span style="">Kwahhhhng!</span></p><p><span style="">Accompanying a large explosion, a Feris in the sky was suddenly falling in flames.</span></p><p><span style="">Doo-doo-doo-doo.</span></p><p><span style="">Eventually, they heard the ground ring out, and they saw a large Undead army appear from over the ridge.</span></p><p><span style="">In front of this army, one could see Death Knights charging on their Phantom Steeds.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;My god.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Latasha&apos;s face turned white.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;It&apos;s the Immortal&apos;s Army!&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Graham&apos;s body trembled as he dropped his staff.</span></p><p><span style="">It was futile. &#xA0;There was no point in struggling to live.</span></p><p><span style="">Even the icon of hope, Tauric shook his head.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;There is no miracle coming...&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">He never would have expected to meet the Immortal&apos;s army here...</span></p><p><span style="">The towns people fell to the floor in despair as they saw the large Undead army charging towards them. &#xA0;All that was left was to wait for their eventual deaths.</span></p><p><span style="">At that moment, a child let out a shout.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;It&apos;s the Holy Maiden! &#xA0;It&apos;s Melody-nim!&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;.....!&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Tauric raised his head at the child&apos;s shout.</span></p><p><span style="">He looked toward the rear of the Undead army. &#xA0;The Immortal was on top of a large Phantom Steed, and it was walking slowly towards them.</span></p><p><span style="">Unbelievably, the Holy Maiden Melody was riding behind him.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Shit! The Immortal was the one that had kidnapped the Holy Maiden?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">The Holy Maiden had been their beacon of hope. &#xA0;There had been no news of her for a long time. &#xA0;They had endured enormous suffering during her absence. &#xA0;However, they would have never thought that the Immortal had gotten in the way of the Holy Maiden.</span></p><p><span style="">While Tauric was glaring at the Immortal, the Undead army charged towards the Vesics that had landed on the ground.</span></p>
