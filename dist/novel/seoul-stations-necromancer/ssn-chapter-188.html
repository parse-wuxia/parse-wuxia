<p>Chapter 188 - Breakeven Point (2)</p><p><span style="">Haesol flinched, and her body shook.</span></p><p><span style="">Her instincts were warning her.</span></p><p><span style="">Her senses were trying to speak to her.</span></p><p><span style="">Nakamura had a bright smile on his face, but there was something very wrong about it.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;If you have something to say, you can talk to me from there.&quot; </span></p><p><span style="">Nakamura stopped walking at Haesol&apos;s slightly sharp words.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Well, I guess this should be good enough. &#xA0;Thankfully, the sun casts long shadows here.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">She didn&apos;t know what he was trying to say, and as she furrowed her brows, she winced when she felt a change come over her body.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;W...what did you do?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">She tried to move, but she wasn&apos;t able to move. &#xA0;She couldn&apos;t move to an unnatural degree.</span></p><p><span style="">Nakamura grinned.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I just touched your shadow.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Nakamura&apos;s long shadow was connected with Haesol&apos;s shadow.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Eeeek.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Nakamura was a master of a large guild, and he was in competition to be the top Roused in Japan. &#xA0;She new his Rank and ability was famous, and she berated herself for only remembering it now.</span></p><p><span style="">No, she never imagined he would attack her. &#xA0;In the end, the result was inevitable.</span></p><p><span style="">He was the prized Roused of Japan. &#xA0;He was Daken guild&apos;s master.</span></p><p><span style="">Shadow Ninja Nakamura.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ooh-ooh-oohk.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Haesol gritted her teeth as she tried to move her body. &#xA0;She might have been taken unawares, but she was a Rank A Roused, who went through the hellish training of Alandal.</span></p><p><span style="">When she used all of her strength, her body started to shake, and she started to move a little bit.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;This&#x2026;.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Nakamura could hold a high Rank Roused like Haesol for only 20 seconds.</span></p><p><span style="">However, it was enough to subdue her.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ooh-oohk.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The members of the Daken guild had already surround Haesol. &#xA0;One of them injected a drug using a needle. &#xA0;Haesol&apos;s eyes flipped up as her body fell over.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;W...what are you doing?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;You are pretty slow at assessing a situation.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Nakamura laughed when he saw Tauric, who was taken aback.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Alphen is moaning in pain, and the Daken guild will help you.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I&apos;m not talking about that. &#xA0;Aren&apos;t you both from earth? &#xA0;Why did you attack her?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I&apos;m disappointed you called it an attack... &#xA0;The Daken guild is merely inheriting the job of Alandal. &#xA0;We will protect you all.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tauric looked at his surrounding.</span></p><p><span style="">Dwarf King Raul was shaking his head from side to side. &#xA0;The great Orc Chieftain Krooger was letting out steam from his nose in anger.</span></p><p><span style="">Kontz, who was the young king of the Honshoo kingdom, had a red face. &#xA0;The Archmage Graham had his two eyes shut.</span></p><p><span style="">Holy Maiden Melody... She looked as if her soul had exited her body. &#xA0;She just stared into the empty air.</span></p><p><span style="">Even if Nakamura hadn&apos;t answered the question, they were already well aware of the answer.</span></p><p><span style="">Tauric looked at Nakamura as he raised both fists.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;We need an ally. &#xA0;We do not need a protector.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Jeez.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Nakamura let out a sigh as if he couldn&apos;t believe their answers. &#xA0;He had already assessed the abilities of all the heroes. &#xA0;The people from the Daken guild had made a perimeter, and they started tightening the perimeter. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">These were the elite members of the guild.</span></p><p><span style="">These men made up 1/3 of the high Ranked Roused of Japan.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Do you really think you can hold us off with these men? &#xA0;If the battle starts, people will gather towards us.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tauric calmly berated Nakamura as he saw the members of the Daken guild gathering around them.</span></p><p><span style="">If he could stop a internal conflict, that would be the better option. &#xA0;He didn&apos;t know what prior friction existed between Alandal and the Daken guild. &#xA0;Since he didn&apos;t know the history behind their conflict, Tauric thought it was better to prevent a fight.</span></p><p><span style="">The Immortal hadn&apos;t returned yet.</span></p><p><span style="">Nakamura was beaming.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Koo-kook. &#xA0;I see you don&apos;t know the reason why I tried to buy some time. &#xA0;&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">He opened his two arms wide.</span></p><p><span style="">It was time.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x3008;The capture of the Colony has been completed.&#x3009;</span></p><p><span style="">An ownerless Colony greeted its new owner. &#xA0;Nakamura&apos;s eyes turned wide when he saw the Points he gained by the capture. &#xA0;He hadn&apos;t done much, yet he had gained an incredible treasure.</span></p><p><span style="">He already possessed a Dimensional Domain through a subway station in Tokyo. &#xA0;Therefore, he knew about the benefits of having a Colony.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I&apos;ll be able replenish new troops.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The list of what he could purchase in the Store was limited. &#xA0;He decided to purchase several thousand goblins. &#xA0;A black portal formed in front of the World Tree, and countless small green colored monsters started pouring out.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;C...crazy.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Kontz&apos;s voice expressed what everyone was feeling at that moment. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">Why did they never think about the possibility of other Dimensional lords existing on earth?</span></p><p><span style="">Nakamura was basically a god in the Colony. &#xA0;Kontz tried to turn back when large walls appeared to surround his group.</span></p><p><span style="">Koo-koo-koohng!</span></p><p><span style="">A ground that held nothing suddenly pushed out castle walls, and it wouldn&apos;t be an exaggeration to call this phenomena as a miracle performed by a god.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Koo-haha. &#xA0;Capture everyone.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">When Nakamura gave his order, the goblin soldiers started moving in perfect order.</span></p><p><span style="">The castle walls that had erupted from the ground became their prison.</span></p><p><span style="">Kahng. &#xA0;Kahng.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Shit!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Dwarf King Raul, who had been pounding on the wall, threw down his hammer.</span></p><p><span style="">He had hit it several hundred times, yet it was showing no signs of breaking.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;We fell in such a futile manner.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">His dejected voice expressed what everyone was feeling.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;It is my fault...&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">She buried her head in her knees as Melody answered with a weak voice. &#xA0;Tauric tried to console her.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;There is no way this this could be your fault, Holy Maiden.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I went against the word of the goddess....&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">She should have listened.</span></p><p><span style="">She shouldn&#x2019;t have doubted...</span></p><p><span style="">Still, nothing would come from her belated regret. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">The oracle had come true. &#xA0;The Immortal lost his Gate, and she had lost her power.</span></p><p><span style="">She was no longer a Holy Maiden. &#xA0;She was just a powerless woman.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Please don&apos;t punish yourself. &#xA0;Since the goddess of Prophecy said it&apos;ll happen, wouldn&apos;t this have happened either way?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Melody kept her head low even after hearing Tauric&#x2019;s words.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Anyways, Dame Haesol isn&apos;t doing so well. &#xA0;It has been 3 days yet she isn&apos;t waking up.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I&apos;m pretty sure they used poison on her.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Since we don&apos;t know what kind of poison....&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">If they had Haesol&apos;s telepathic ability, they would be able to communicate to those outside. &#xA0;However, she wasn&apos;t showing any signs of waking up, so they could only look on in frustration.</span></p><p><span style="">***</span></p><p><span style="">Forest below the Saurus mountain.</span></p><p><span style="">Kim-joonyong had climbed to the top of the tree to observe the state of the Colony. &#xA0;The goblin soldiers had ballooned into 20,000, and they were dispatched along the castle walls.</span></p><p><span style="">One could see some of the Coalition troops between the goblins. &#xA0;Kim-joonyong wondered what lie the Daken guild had told to get the people of Coalition on their side. &#xA0;He was frustrated by the situation.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Those Japanese bastards&#x2026;.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">A rolling rock had dislodged the stone in place.</span></p><p><span style="">The Daken guild had started a rumor that the Immortal had betrayed everyone. &#xA0;The Phantom Unit quickly escaped, but Haesol, who was the leader of the Phantom unit, couldn&apos;t be contacted.</span></p><p><span style="">It was clear that she was either killed or she was taken hostage. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">Joonyong ended his scouting of the Colony, and he descended the tree.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Unit commander Blanka.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;So how was it, Joonyong? &#xA0;Do you see Haesol?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;No. &#xA0;I didn&apos;t see her anywhere.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;This is a disaster. &#xA0;Haesol is in danger.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Blanka&apos;s face was full of worry. &#xA0;&#xA0;It was the same for the rag tag group of the Phantom Unit.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;The president has to come back. &#xA0;Or, we have to try to turn back the Skeleton Army.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">It wouldn&apos;t be easy for the members of the Phantom Unit to rescue Haesol. Their surplus troops were being lead by Jaenis, and Kahng-woojin had gone looking for Heres&apos; Temple.</span></p><p><span style="">It would be great if either one of them were here, but there had heard no news from both of them.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Shit.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Joonyong let out a curse.</span></p><p><span style="">He had risen to Rank A, but nothing had changed.</span></p><p><span style="">Whether he was a low Rank Roused or a high Rank Roused, he was an insignificant human. &#xA0;He still couldn&#x2019;t be of much help.</span></p><p><span style="">A mere Roused like him couldn&#x2019;t challenge a Dimensional lord, who possessed a Colony. &#xA0;His opponent was too strong.</span></p><p><span style="">At that moment, the foliage above them shook as something heavy fell from the sky. &#xA0;The Phantom Unit, who had momentarily let their guards down, nervously vigilant against this object. &#xA0;All of their eyes widened.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What are you guys doing here?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;King!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin jumped off the Phantom Steed, and he grinned at the people, who were excitedly greeting him.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hoo-hook. &#xA0;We are in a bad spot, president.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Blanka felt overwhelmed with joy at seeing Woojin, so he started crying.</span></p><p><span style="">Why did &#xA0;he have to be so late in showing up....</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Stop crying. &#xA0;Gather around me.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin asked a question when all the members of the Phantom Unit gathered in front of him.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;So who did this to us?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Uh? &#xA0;You knew about it?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Of course, he knew. &#xA0;His Status Window gave him an alert when his Colony was stolen.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Tell me who.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;It was Nakamura from the Daken guild.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hmmm.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin frowned.</span></p><p><span style="">When he received the alert that said he had lost his Saurus Colony, he had assumed it was one of Trahnet&#x2019;s great lords. &#xA0;That wasn&#x2019;t the case.</span></p><p><span style="">His Colony had been taken away without suffering from any attack.</span></p><p><span style="">An person from earth had taken it.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;This is ridiculous.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Woojin had never thought about this possibility, so he let out a big sigh.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;All right. &#xA0;Let&apos;s get it back.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Kim-joonyong became surprised, and he got up from his seat.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;W...we have to make plans.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;That&#x2019;s right! &#xA0;Haesol was taken hostage. &#xA0;It&apos;ll be dangerous.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">At Blanka&#x2019;s words, Woojin nodded his head.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;All right. &#xA0;Let&apos;s hurry up and get there.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;So the plan&#x2026;.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Joonyong let his words of incredulity leak out, but Woojin was already striding well in front of them.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I...I&apos;ll follow you.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">It wasn&#x2019;t easy to be so confident in oneself. &#xA0;Joonyong found it fascinating that Woojin was able to be so dependable under hardship.</span></p><p><span style="">Kahng-woojin didn&#x2019;t have his Undead army, but none of the men thought Kahng-woojin would lose a fight.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">***</span></p><p><span style="">Top of the Saurus Colony.</span></p><p><span style="">A large palace had been built in front of the World Tree.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Kahng-woojin is here, master.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hooo hoo hoo. &#xA0;Kahng-woojin?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Nakamura, who had been sitting on the throne, stood up.</span></p><p><span style="">He now knew why Kahng-woojin was so strong. &#xA0;He now knew why he possessed overwhelming power despite being human. &#xA0;He understood it.</span></p><p><span style="">Dimensional lord.</span></p><p><span style="">That bastard had put one foot into the realm of the gods. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">How unfair was it for everyone else?</span></p><p><span style="">He acted all superior because of this fact&#x2026;.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I&apos;ll go. &#xA0;Of course. &#xA0;I have to go greet him.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Nakamura laughed as he got up from the throne.</span></p><p><span style="">He was also a Dimensional lord.</span></p><p><span style="">The Points wasn&#x2019;t just used to recharge one&#x2019;s troops. &#xA0;It also allowed one to increase one&#x2019;s ability.</span></p><p><span style="">Fifth Rank Roused?</span></p><p><span style="">His power was now on a different level, and he was brimming with confidence now. &#xA0;He was in the same position as Kahng-woojin.</span></p><p><span style="">King of Alandal?</span></p><p><span style="">Arrogant&#x2026;.</span></p><p><span style="">He&apos;ll kill the bastard to become the new king.</span></p><p><span style="">After Nakamura exited the palace, his eyebrows twitched.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Are you the one?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Nakamura had decorated the large front yard of the palace in a Japanese style. &#xA0;The garden &#xA0;was completely devastated, and Kahng-woojin was standing in the middle.</span></p><p><span style="">The imprisoned heroes of Alphen had been freed, and they stood around Kahng-woojin with gaunt expressions on their faces.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;How&#x2026;.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">It had been only several minutes since he had received the report. &#xA0;How was Kahng-woojin able to come here so fast?</span></p><p><span style="">Before he could &#xA0;solve this mystery, Kahng-woojin walked towards Nakamura. &#xA0;Each step made his heart beat fast, but Nakamura tried his best to harden his heart.</span></p><p><span style="">There was no gap between him and that bastard.</span></p><p><span style="">He would be able to fight him on even grounds as a Dimensional lord.</span></p><p><span style="">Even he could clear out the the scrubs in couple minutes if he wanted to.</span></p><p><span style="">Nakamura&#x2019;s face once again held a relaxed smile on his face.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hue hue. &#xA0;It would be best if you don&#x2019;t get any closer to me, King of Alandal.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;&#x2026;.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Woojin didn&apos;t stop walking.</span></p><p><span style="">Nakamura also didn&#x2019;t retreat, and when they were about two meters apart, Woojin stopped walking.</span></p><p><span style="">Nakamura let out a laugh full of delight.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Koo-haha. &#xA0;You touched it.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Woojin tilted his head in puzzlement.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Your shadow touched my shadow.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;&#x2026;.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Woojin furrowed his brows as he looked at Nakamura. &#xA0;The people from afar held their breath as they watched the two confront each other. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">Nakamura&#x2019;s Shadow Bind was powerful.</span></p><p><span style="">Even Haesol was ensnared without being able to do anything.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What about it?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin once again took a step forward.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Uh uh?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Nakamura instinctively took a step back.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;How are you able to move?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">His face showed how flustered he was. &#xA0;As he was taking steps backward, something surprising occurred.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;H...how come I can&apos;t move?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">He couldn&#x2019;t move his body.</span></p><p><span style="">It was as if his shadow was bound....</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Are you really this weak?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;&#x2026;.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Woojin grinned as he place his hand on top of Nakamura&apos;s head.</span></p><p><span style="">He possessed a Shadow Imp, yet this bastard had tried to bind his shadow....</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Who gave it to you? &#xA0;Who gave you the Dimensional Proof?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">It would be impossible for the Daken Guild could have gathered 3 Dimensional Fragments. &#xA0;If they could gather that many, it meant several dozen Dimensional Fragments were already gathered by people of earth.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I...I won&apos;t say anything.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Then don&apos;t do it.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin grasped Nakamura&#x2019;&apos;s head as he started to squeeze.</span></p>
