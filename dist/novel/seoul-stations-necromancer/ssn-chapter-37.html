<p><strong>Chapter 37 Establishing a Guild(2).</strong></p><div id="chapterContent" class="innerContent fr-view"><p><span style="">Chapter 37 &#x2013; Establishing a Guild(2)</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p><p><span style="">(<span>TLN: This is a sponsored chapter. The donor didn&#x2019;t want his name known. I woke up late, and I don&#x2019;t think I&#x2019;ll be able to push out 2 chapters today. Also, I changed the setting on the comment section. I need to approve the comment if its the first time you are posting a comment here. So don&#x2019;t be alarmed if you comment isn&#x2019;t showing up. I was getting like 100+ spam comments since yesterday??)</span></span></p><p><span style="">*At the Hotel owned by the Hammer guild*</span></p><p><span style="">The large banquet hall was filled to capacity with people.</span></p><p><span style="">Except for those on duty tonight, it seemed everyone had gathered here today.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;This is crazy.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;T&#x2026;team leader. What should we do?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;How should I know?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">It wasn&#x2019;t an atmosphere where he would be able to have a private talk.</span></p><p><span style="">It was as if all the chefs inside the hotel had been mobilized to prepare the buffet. Everyone was in a cheerful mood, but Jung-minchan and Kim-haemin&#x2019;s face was turning darker as time passed.</span></p><p><span style="">The department head, who would usually accept their letter of recommendation, had been transferred, and Minchan had been promoted to the head of his own department.</span></p><p><span style="">The president was sitting at the table reserved for the managers and directors. Minchan was surrounded by his team mates, and he was continuously receiving congratulations for his promotion.</span></p><p><span style="">At that moment, Kim-haemin pushed an envelope towards Minchan.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What are you doing?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Please accept my letter of resignation.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;&#x2026;.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;At least I have to get out.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;But we are going to the same place.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Maybe I&#x2019;ll go there early and ask for a better position. Who knows? Maybe I&#x2019;ll receive a higher position than team leader Jung.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Son of a bitch. He was normally rude, but why was he so impudent today?</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Uh-ooh. I&#x2019;m uncomfortable in these kind of places, so the food won&#x2019;t even go down my throat. I&#x2019;m going to go first. Team leader fighting!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hey.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Haemin quickly disappeared as if he didn&#x2019;t want to be caught. The resignation letters held firmly in Minchan&#x2019;s hand shook.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Department head. Please let me pour you a glass.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Uh, all right.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The employees were already calling him department head, and they were sucking up to him. Minchan kept receiving alcohol from the employees, and he knew he couldn&#x2019;t put this off any longer.</span></p><p><span style="">If he resigned, Minchan would probably never see them again, but the guild society was pretty small. There was a chance they would cross paths, so there was no reason why he should leave on bad terms. It would only make it more difficult for Woojin and his new guild.</span></p><p><span style="">He didn&#x2019;t know how many glasses of alcohol he had emptied already.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Koooo.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Michan stood up from his seat, then he headed towards the table set aside for the directors.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hahaha. Congratulations on becoming the guild master of the greatest guild in Korea.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Huh huh huht. What are you saying? It is all thanks to you all.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Minchan firmed his resolve as he saw Park-sahngoh, who looked as happy as Minchan had ever seen him be. It didn&#x2019;t matter what he said since he was fucking Park-sahngoh over. The possibility of a beautiful parting didn&#x201D;t exist.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Excuse me, president.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Oh my. Aren&#x2019;t you the guild&#x2019;s number one star, chief Jung? Now now. Please come over here.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The directors looked at Minchan as the president call him over.</span></p><p><span style="">Some of them were several prospects Jung-minchan had found in the past. They were all Rank B Roused. They were held in high esteem for their high Roused Rank and their history of attacking Dungeons.</span></p><p><span style="">It was a common occurrence to have yesterday&#x2019;s comrade be given a higher position in a brief amount of time. This was why not many Roused bellyached at the other&#x2019;s promotion. They didn&#x2019;t become jealous.</span></p><p><span style="">The positions were only words to be printed on a business card for the Roused. Guild was just a place for them to gather. It was a place where they could work together for profit. If the Roused didn&#x2019;t like the guild, they could leave after their contracts ended.</span></p><p><span style="">Still, even if the title was considered to be a single line on the business card, it was a target to aim for.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;President. I have something to say to you.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Oh oh. We have to listen to Department Head Jung&#x2019;s tale of exploits.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I failed.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">At Minchan&#x2019;s words, Park-sahngho&#x2019;s smiling face froze in place.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I failed in making a contract with Mr. Kang-woojin.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What did you say?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I&#x2019;m deeply ashamed of myself.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;&#x2026;.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Park-sahngoh&#x2019;s face became turbulent. What kind of place was this? Wasn&#x2019;t this party thrown to congratulate Jung-minchan&#x2019;s promotion, and to celebrate him bringing in an almost verified Rank A Roused Kang-woojin in to the Hammer guild?</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;How could you say such a thing right now?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I&#x2019;m sorry.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Is this something you can get away with just by saying you are sorry? Do you want to be fired from the company?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Uh? If that happened then he would be thankful.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Do you know how much money you spent while you tailed after Kang-Woojin? Do you think an apology is enough?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">He had allowed Wooin to use the Dungeon for free. Moreover, he spent money to secretly manipulate Woojin&#x2019;s Roused Rank&#x2026;. A loss was a loss..</span></p><p><span style="">Yes, he was wrong. He was wrong. He made a very big mistake.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I will take all the blame.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Blame? Is this how you take the blame&#x2026; What is this?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;This is my resignation letter. I will take all the blame, and I will resign from the Hammer guild.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Park-sahngoh glanced at the resignation letter, and he looked at Minchan with a bewildered expression on his face.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Are you crazy?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;You aren&#x2019;t a politician. Do you really think you are taking full responsibility by stepping away? Aren&#x2019;t you running away after making a mess?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;&#x2026;.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">What could he say? No. What words were needed?</span></p><p><span style="">He was going to quit.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I&#x2019;m leaving. Please take care of yourself.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">He placed two envelopes containing resignation letters on the table.</span></p><p><span style="">Jung-minchan gave a bow then he escaped the banquet hall in all haste.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;That, that! That crazy son of a bitch!?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Jung-michan heard Park-sahngoh fly into a rage, but he continued to walk as he closed his ears. His heart was jumping inside his chest. He was still nervous, but there was a faint smile on his face.</span></p><p><span style="">It had felt great and satisfying. Moreover, he was filled with anticipation.</span></p><p><span style="">Michan had selected the seed rather than the fruit.</span></p><p><span style="">When he stepped outside, Haemin was already in the front with his car.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Over hear, team leader.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Ah. This is why he still liked that rude bastard.</span></p><p><span style="">*</span></p><p><span style="">*Sahdahng station&#x2019;s Angel Angel Business room. 8 PM.*</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Welcome to Alandal.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Minchan and Haemin grinned at Woojin&#x2019;s words.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I am looking forward to working with you.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I will treat you as my president. Please look out for me.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I will.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin and Minchan shared a handshake.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Feel free to treat me in a way that is comfortable for you. I will use all my strength to establish Alandal.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Is that so? Then I can just call you Minchan?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Uh? Isn&#x2019;t he being a little bit too familiar with him? (TLN:he stopped speaking in the respectful form)</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Please call me team leader Jung.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;All right, team leader. I&#x2019;ll leave the establishment of the guild in your care. Do what you consider is best.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;yes.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">There was a saying that the people of the east being courteous is a thing of the past, yet&#x2026; Jung-minchan was having a hard time adjusting to it.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;So you want to go have some soju today?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;&#x2026;.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">His view on life seemed to be simple.</span></p><p><span style="">If someone else saw them, it would look like they were making a club instead of a guild.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Even if we get acquainted part to a later date&#x2026; There is a matter president needs to address first. &#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What is it?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;We need at least 5 founding members to establish a guild.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">They were in need of one more person.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Should we put Jaemin in the guild?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I&#x2019;m pretty sure you can&#x2019;t use an under-age youth.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes. An underage youth can&#x2019;t be one of the founding members.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Minchan confirmed Sunggoo&#x2019;s words. Woojin nonchalantly opened his hand phone.</span></p><p><span style=""><span>[Mother][Do-jaemin][Real Jaemin]<a id="footnoteref-4" href="#footnote-4">[4]</a></span></span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Ah. I really don&#x2019;t know a lot of people.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">He thought his personal connection in this world was quite simple.</span></p><p><span style="">When his mother saw Woojin falling into the Dungeon by accident on the broadcast, she had become bedridden. Moreover, the reporters kept bothering her at work, so she had to quit her job. Currently, she was just staying at home.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Mother isn&#x2019;t an option.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">If he excluded Jaemin and all the people gathered here, then he didn&#x2019;t have any more acquaintances. One was an unknown number&#x2026; So the phone salesman was the only one left.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Do we just need a name to use?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What? Yes. We just need to fill the 5 spots.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Minchan guessed Woojin was trying to use a family member&#x2019;s name for the position of Guild&#x2019;s founding member. Woojin brought up the phone salesman&#x2019;s number then he pressed the call button.</span></p><p><span style="">Doo-roo-roo-roo</span></p><p><span style="">After a long wait time, the call was connected.</span></p><p><span style="">[Ah, hello?]</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ah, do you remember me? From that time?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">[O&#x2026;of course. I remember. I remember very well.]</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin put his phone down for a moment, and he looked towards Minchan.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What documents are needed?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What? He just needs his ID, a copy of his ID, and if he has a seal, he should bring it.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin held up his hand phone again, then he started talking again.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Come to Angel Angel near the intersection. Bring your ID and seal.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">[&#x2026;why do you need me to do that?]</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ah. I just need to borrow your name for a moment..&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">[&#x2026;&#x2026;.]</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Why aren&#x2019;t you answering?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">[I saw it all on TV.]</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;TV?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">[Your face is known to the whole country now. Do you think you will be able to ask me to do anything illegal?]</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ha. Do you think I am you? This isn&#x2019;t a scam, so come here with everything. I just need to borrow your name for a moment.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">[I&#x2026;I&#x2019;m going to call the police..]</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I don&#x2019;t care if you call them or not. Do it before I get mad. Do you want me to go there?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">[N&#x2026;no. I&#x2019;ll be there.]</span></p><p><span style="">Minchan asked a question after Woojin ended the call.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Who is it?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ah. It&#x2019;s just someone I know.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Is he coming here?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;He&#x2019;ll be here soon.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Excellent. I&#x2019;ll fill out the required initial paperwork, and I&#x2019;ll go to the Management Bureau tomorrow to get an approval.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Minchan took out several previously prepared stack of documents from his briefcase.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I&#x2019;m liking how this had turned out.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Whether it was trying to run a guild or a country, one needed at least one aide. One would be able to dump the annoying work on the aide. Woojin was pleased by the fact that he had made an offer to Minchan.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Oh yea. There is a something we need to resolve with haste.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What is it?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;We have to create a guide for the Seoul National University station&#x2019;s 6th exit Dungeon. There is no information on this 5 star Dungeon, so it isn&#x2019;t an easy Dungeon to attempt. If there is no guide then we would be hard-pressed to get any appointments.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The very first team or guild to clear a Dungeon received a tremendous benefit.</span></p><p><span style="">Every time the Dungeon is cleared, a 30% commission was taken from the price of the blood stones. Moreover, one could levy a usage fee for the Dungeon.</span></p><p><span style="">This was why it was required to disclose all the general knowledge of the Dungeon. Once the information is disseminated, the difficulty in clearing the Dungeon decreased, and it would become more manageable for the Rank B teams to clear the 5 star Dungeons.</span></p><p><span style="">The large guilds, and the upper-tier average sized guild had numerous teams of that caliber. So this Dungeon would bring in a lot of profit.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Well, are we required to receive the Roused who want to use the Dungeon? I could just use it.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;During the times when president has to rest, wouldn&#x2019;t it be better if the Dungeon is put to use instead of keeping it idle?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;You have a good point.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin didn&#x2019;t think too long on it.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I&#x2019;ll immediately head towards the Dungeon after a the required paperwork is prepared.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">If he had an idea, then Woojin acted on it immediately.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Let&#x2019;s go, Sunggoo.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;You&#x2026;you want me to go? It&#x2019;s a 5 star Dungeon&#x2026;&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">He had risen to Rank D, but he didn&#x2019;t think his skill measured up to the rank. Sung-goo couldn&#x2019;t help, but become nervous.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Then you don&#x2019;t want to go?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;N&#x2026;.no. I&#x2019;ll go.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">He was scared, but at the same time, he felt a weird anticipation inside his heart.</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin grinned as he looked at Sunggoo.</span></p><p><span style="">*</span></p><p><span style="">Woo-soonghoon entered the cafe&#x2019;s business room. He turned his bleary eyes towards the people gathered in one place. They were the culprits causing a ruckus in the news.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Look here. Look here. Everyone is gathered here.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">He had seen them on the news. Kang-woojin was the one who had accidentally fallen into the Dungeon. The others were at the scene of the accident.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Uh, you are here?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">His body froze when he heard Woojin speak. He shrunk back as if he had met his natural enemy.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Did you bring what I asked you to bring?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I brought it, but&#x2026;.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Then go talk to team leader Jung.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin and Sunggoo stood up.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Keep up the good work, team leader Jung. It&#x2019;ll probably be tomorrow by the time I finish clearing the Dungeon. We&#x2019;ll have some soju tomorrow.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes, president. As I have told you before, I&#x2019;ll make the preparations.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Woo-soonghoon&#x2019;s eyes narrowed. What kind of situation was this?</span></p><p><span style="">When Woojin and Sunggoo left, Jung-minchan offered his hand for a handshake.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;My name is Jung-minchan. I used to be the team leader at the Hammer guild. I&#x2019;ll be starting the Alandal guild with you. I&#x2019;m pleased to meet you. I look forward to working with you.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Hammer guild? One of the 3 great guilds of Korea?</span></p><p><span style="">This person used to be a team leader in the Hammer guild?</span></p><p><span style="">Kim-haemin shook his hand immediately afterward. Woo-soonghoon grabbed his hand in confusion.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;My name is Kim-haemin. Heh heh. Please take care of me. If you are an acquaintance of the president then&#x2026; Friend? Or relative?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">What is this? They were swindlers.</span></p><p><span style="">Woo-soonghoon acted like he was listening to their stories, and he secretly searched for their info below the table. He had searched using Kang-woojin&#x2019;s news as the focus, so there were very little information on his companions.</span></p><p><span style="">Still, the internet should have some articles about them. His eyes turned round when he searched for the articles.</span></p><p></p></div><div class="footnotes"><ol><li><span id="footnote-4">hundred thousand][Phone salesman][Kim-haemin<a href="#footnoteref-4" class="btn btn-sm btn-link"><i class="fa fa-hand-o-left"></i></a></span></li></ol></div><p></p>
