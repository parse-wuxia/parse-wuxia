<p>Chapter 172 - Air Strike(1)</p><p><span style="">Shoo-shoohk!</span></p><p><span style="">When Woojin arrived at his Dimensional Domain, it looked the same as before. &#xA0;However, when he exited the Castle, the town looked totally different.</span></p><p><span style="">Hwah-roo-roohk.</span></p><p><span style="">Houses were burning, and there were corpses strewn everywhere. &#xA0;It looked as if they had put up a fight against the Adventurers.</span></p><p><span style="">The corpses had yet to be cleared away, so they were strewn in various locations. &#xA0;Then there were the soldiers on patrol. &#xA0;If one looked at the broken houses, one could tell the fight had happened not too long ago.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Kiba.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">[My Lord.]</span></p><p><span style="">Black smoke coalesced to form Kiba, and he got on one knee.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Did strong Adventurers come this time around?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">[It was a rebellion.]</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Rebellion?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">[An uprising sometimes occurs amongst the Dimensional Residents.]</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Hmmm.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin stroked his chin.</span></p><p><span style="">There were several factors that could threaten a Dimensional Domain. &#xA0;There was the Dimensional battle, Duel requests and the Adventurers that come through the Dungeon.</span></p><p><span style="">There were also the possibility of a rebellion from the Dimensional residents, who had migrated here. &#xA0;Then there were the thieves that intentionally came here to steal the Domain.</span></p><p><span style="">The difference between a Dimensional Resident and a Dimensional lord was the fact that one possessed a Domain. &#xA0;There were a lot of wanderers that were very strong. &#xA0;If Woojin lost his Dimensional Domain, he would wander around doing the same thing.</span></p><p><span style="">Moreover, there were a lot of wanderers that banded together to form their own mercenary units. &#xA0;These groups wandered around from place to place as they caused trouble.</span></p><p><span style="">However, there were only one reason why an uprising would occur.</span></p><p><span style="">It wasn&apos;t the fact that he was weak, but...</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Do they think I&apos;m a pushover?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">[No way! No one here would dare to think of our lord as a pushover.]</span></p><p><span style="">Kiba suddenly yelled out. Kiba continued to speak as he looked at the corpses.</span></p><p><span style="">[They were intentionally sent here. &#xA0;It looks to be a mercenary outfit that took a commission from Liah.]</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin let out a sigh.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Why does she keep aiming for me?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Liah had failed in taking him down in the Dimensional battle and the Duel. &#xA0;Now she was using subterfuge to take down his Domain.</span></p><p><span style="">She had said that he&apos;ll never be able to protect his home planet of earth. &#xA0;Her words kept ringing in his ears.</span></p><p><span style="">Maybe she wanted to prove her own words. &#xA0;This might be why Liah kept harassing him.</span></p><p><span style="">If he didn&apos;t have Death Knights like Kiba, he might have had his Domain stolen from under him.</span></p><p><span style="">If it wasn&apos;t for his reliable Familiars, her relentless attacks might have worked.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Were they a bit hard to put down?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">[It wasn&apos;t too hard. &#xA0;I barely had to replenish our forces.]</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin tilted his head in puzzlement.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Then where did my Points go?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">He&apos;ll be able to get a full accounting of how his Points were spent by sitting on his Throne. &#xA0;He&apos;ll find out what had happened by opening his Domain Management Window.</span></p><p><span style="">When Woojin was about to turn away, Kiba suddenly spoke.</span></p><p><span style="">[I want to run alongside the lord in the battlefield.]</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;....&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin looked at Kiba.</span></p><p><span style="">He could feel a desperate longing emanating from the large Death Knight. &#xA0;There were only a small number of Adventurers that attacked the Dimensional Domain of Alandal through the Dungeons.</span></p><p><span style="">There were the occasional uprisings, but Kiba could count those instances with a single hand.</span></p><p><span style="">He was the Defense Commander of the Domain, and his duties were boring him to tears. &#xA0;Woojin thought he had neglected Kiba for too long.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;All right. &#xA0;I&apos;ll replace you with someone else.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">[I&apos;ll spread a carpet of blood on the lord&apos;s battlefield!]</span></p><p><span style="">Undead Army.</span></p><p><span style="">He was the strongest Death Knight. &#xA0;The declaration suited Kiba, since he was the spearhead of the army.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I like what you are saying.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin grinned as he glanced at Kiba.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I&apos;ll replace you with a pinch hitter, so just wait a little bit more. &#xA0;I&apos;ll ride into the next battle with you.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">[I wait for the lord&apos;s command!]</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin returned to the Throne inside the lord&apos;s castle.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Let&apos;s see.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">The Points that was used to replenish the forces was significant, but this wasn&#x2019;t a problem. &#xA0;He was collecting taxes through his Domain and Colonies. &#xA0;He was bringing in more than he was in spending on replenishing troops.</span></p><p><span style="">It didn&apos;t take him long to find the source of the drain.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;It&apos;s Bibi.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Bibi was in charge of earth&#x2019;s Colony city. &#xA0;She had named it &#x2018;Bibi&#x2019;s Castle&#x2019;, and he had spent a massive amount of points on the city.</span></p><p><span style="">However, it wasn&#x2019;t a problem, since his Points would be increasing as time passed.</span></p><p><span style="">In the future, he&#x2019;ll be able to gather earth&#x2019;s Bloodstones through the Colony, so the amount of insignificant in context. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">Moreover, Woojin had just spent twice the amount of Points compared to Bibi when he built the Saurus Colony.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I&apos;ll go see what&apos;s going on.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">A massive amount of Points had been expended at once. &#xA0;There was a small possibility that Bibi had to replenish all her troops in response to an enemy attack. &#xA0;He was a little bit worried.</span></p><p><span style="">He had planned on returning to Alphen immediately, but he was curious as to see how much change had occurred at his Colony. &#xA0;He passed through the portal to head to Bibi&apos;s Castle.</span></p><p><span style="">***</span></p><p><span style="">Pul-luhk.</span></p><p><span style="">The flag with the yawning cat was billowing in the wind. &#xA0;When Woojin came out of the portal, he titled his head in confusion.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;It changed a lot.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">The deck had been wide open, but now there were buildings obstructing the view. &#xA0;One could call it a town.</span></p><p><span style="">There were some buildings that looked modern, and there were also buildings that looked similar to the ones in Alphen. &#xA0;It felt as if he was walking through an unfamiliar city.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Bibi.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Master!&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">At Woojin&apos;s call, a puff of black smoke appeared as Bibi appeared.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Heh heh. &#xA0;How&apos;s everything going?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Well, everything is progressing as planned.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Heh heh.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">He thought about how Bibi had remade Alandal, so he could guess at what the Colony would look like. &#xA0;However, he hadn&#x2019;t given her the authority to use his Points, so Bibi could purchase cafes and stores.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;How&apos;s our defense?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">The fact that this was a moving fortress was the most important point in making this Colony.</span></p><p><span style="">It was very important for it to have defensive capabilities, so it could keep everyone safe. &#xA0;One couldn&#x2019;t half-ass it, and Bibi was well aware of this fact.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;It burned a lot of Points.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;....&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">She was being boastful, so it seemed she must have used a lot of Points by going overboard on defense.</span></p><p><span style="">Of course, the aircraft carrier was much smaller than the Saurus mountain.</span></p><p><span style="">It is small yet she had used half the Points needed to construct the Saurus Colony. &#xA0;This was why his expectation was high.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Follow me, master. &#xA0;I&#x2019;ll show you.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Bibi looked like a child that was showing off a toy she had made.</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin followed her up the control tower, and he came face-to-face with Jung-minchan along the way.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;K...king!&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;What is wrong with you? Are you sick?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin worriedly asked the pale-faced Minchan. &#xA0;Minchan&#x2019;s face crumpled up as he answered Woojin.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;M..motion sickness...&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Huh. &#xA0;You are sea sick?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin noticed the vibration beneath his feet, so it seemed the aircraft carrier was on the move right now.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I...if it was sea sickness, I would be ok, but....Ooh-oohk...&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Minchan covered his mouth, and he quickly disappeared down the stairs. &#xA0;Woojin shrugged his shoulder as he asked Bibi a question.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Where are we headed?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;We wanted to do the move in one sitting, so we decided to head towards Seoul. &#xA0;We are currently passing by Daejun.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Mmmm. &#xA0;It&#x2019;ll be great if we could move everything at once&#x2026; &#xA0;Daejun?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Yes. Heh heh. &#xA0;I fixed what was broken, so we can fly again.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;....&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Broken?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">This aircraft carrier was built a long time ago, but it hadn&#x2019;t been broken&#x2026;. &#xA0;Woojin arrived at the top of the control tower, and he looked out the window.</span></p><p><span style="">Kiehhhhhk!</span></p><p><span style="">The cries of the Wyverns was heard through the window. &#xA0;He saw twelve Wyverns flying around the aircraft carrier as an escort.</span></p><p><span style="">There were beings from one of the other race riding the Wyverns.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;The Ratick race are talented riders. &#xA0;We decided to always have them deployed as guards. &#xA0;They are also tasked to recon the surrounding area.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Bibi started boasting about her accomplishments.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I also built cannons, and it can fire in all directions. &#xA0;&#xA0;The engineer Nosam adapted earth&#x2019;s technology, so there aren&#x2019;t any official names for these weapons. &#xA0;Why don&#x2019;t master name them?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;....&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Bibi spoke as she pulled up a hologram in front of him. &#xA0;She showed him the entire design plans for the modified aircraft carrier.</span></p><p><span style="">There were 120 openings from front to back, and it was all equipped with cannons.</span></p><p><span style="">The problem was the fact that the cannons weren&apos;t only equipped on the side of the aircraft carrier. &#xA0;It was built along the keel and the hull.</span></p><p><span style="">It looked like a hedgehog turned over on its back.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I also put aside a landing strip for the Wyverns. &#xA0;They can be deployed immediately.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">He looked beyond the window to look at the spot being pointed out by Bibi. &#xA0;There was an empty spot on the deck, and there was something that looked like a strange looking hill next to it. &#xA0;Woojin could see Wyverns coiled and resting on this hill. &#xA0;He could see over 40 of them with his eyes.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;How many?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;If I include the Wyverns on patrol, we have 107 Wyverns.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">She looked up at Woojin with twinkling eyes as if to say, &#x2018;Did I do good?&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;....&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">He had tasked her to come up with the defense of the fortress, so he expected this level of defensive capability. &#xA0;However&#x2026;.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;So we are flying in the sky right now?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Of course.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin&#x2019;s expression did not change, so Bibi tried to bring up some of the things she had been working on in secret.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Hmmm. &#xA0;I felt as if we didn&#x2019;t have enough weapons for offense, so we are developing several weapons. &#xA0;Moreover, it would be a drain on our Points, but we are building a barrier that&#x2019;ll activate when our enemies attack...&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Ah. &#xA0;You can stop talking now.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin placed his hand on top of Bibi&#x2019;s head.</span></p><p><span style="">This might be an excessive investment, but this was related to the safety of his family. &#xA0;This was why he welcomed it.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;You did very well.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Heh heh.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin patted Bibi&#x2019;s head, and he looked out at the view. &#xA0;He looked beyond the flying Wyverns, and he could see sunlight peeking out through the clouds.</span></p><p><span style="">He had no idea how she came up with the idea to make a flying fortress&#x2026;.</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin smiled.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I really like it.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Wasn&#x2019;t it better to fly away in a dangerous situation? &#xA0;They wouldn&#x2019;t be constrained by the sea now.</span></p><p><span style="">Bibi also laughed when she heard Woojijn&#x2019;s praise.</span></p><p><span style="">***</span></p><p><span style="">Saurus Colony.</span></p><p><span style="">Most of the nearby monsters had been exterminated, and the survivors in the nearby gathered to grow the Colony. &#xA0;As more people came in, Sunggoo and Jaemin had less things to do.</span></p><p><span style="">They weren&#x2019;t needed for hunting down weak monsters. &#xA0;It was the job of the inexperienced Phantom Unit and the people of Alphen to hunt down the scrubs.</span></p><p><span style="">During the dangerous battle, they had always pined for free time. &#xA0;Once they got their free time, they were bored now.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Ah. &#xA0;When will hyung-nim get back here?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I have no idea. &#xA0;I guess Sunggoo hyung-nim is now accustomed to all of this.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;No way. &#xA0;I&#x2019;m not accustomed to it.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Sunggoo felt a chill at the tip of his nose, so he rubbed his hand against it.</span></p><p><span style="">Jaemin continued to speak.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I read this in a book. &#xA0;If a slave is suddenly made a free man, the slave would be unable to get used to the outside world, and he would put the shackles back on himself.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;So I&apos;m the slave?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I&apos;m not saying that, but...&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Dude. &#xA0;You&#x2019;ve come a long way if you can speak those kinds of words to me.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Jaemin had an apologetic expression when Sunggoo spoke.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I didn&apos;t say it to make you feel bad.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Ha. &#xA0;Now that I think about it I do want to see Jaenis-nim.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;....&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">...he really was the slave in the story.</span></p><p><span style="">Jaemin was dumbfounded as he stared at side of Sunggoo&#x2019;s face. &#xA0;He had been subjected to near-death dangers, yet he still wanted to see Jaenis&#x2026; &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">Was he a masochist?</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Ah. &#xA0;I want to eat ramen and kimbap.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Seriously.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Jaemin agreed with Sunggoo&apos;s words. &#xA0;It was as if Alphen&apos;s food wasn&apos;t edible. &#xA0;Moreover, they were able purchase food through the Colony, and it was decent.</span></p><p><span style="">However, Sunggoo and Jaemin were natives of Korea. &#xA0;At times, they thought about eating rice. &#xA0;Their mouths watered especially when they thought about ramen. &#xA0;It was something they ate quite often.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Should we go to earth for a brief moment?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Woojin-hyung might discipline you.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;...let&apos;s just be patient.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">When Kahng-woojin returned to Alphen, he wanted permission to be able to frequently visit earth. &#xA0;He was told to clear the nearby monsters, and now he felt like a student that had finished all his homework. &#xA0;There was an empty feeling inside him.</span></p><p><span style="">At that moment, Elf Lord Latasha approached the two.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;What are the heroes of earth talking about?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Latasha was wary and abrasive towards Woojin. &#xA0;However, her attitude was a bit better with Sunggoo and Jaemin.</span></p><p><span style="">It was actually quite favorable towards them.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Ah, Latasha. &#xA0;We are talking about ramen.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Ramen?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Yes. It is a noodle type food, and it is incredibly delicious. &#xA0;It is an earth cuisine, so we aren&apos;t able to acquire it here.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Hmmm. I heard the synchronization with the planet earth isn&apos;t finished yet.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Yes.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I heard you&#x2019;ll be able to buy Items from earth when the Synchronization ends.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">The Dimensional Store had everything.</span></p><p><span style="">Since the Synchronization hadn&#x2019;t ended, they could buy anything from earthy. &#xA0;They could only buy Items from Alphen.</span></p><p><span style="">Of course, there were similar Items, but....</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Uh? Once the Synchronization ends, we&#x2019;ll be able to bring earth items through the portal.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I guess?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">At Jaemin&apos;s words, Sungoo tilted his head.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Wow. &#xA0;What would hyung like to bring here?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I want a car.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I want a computer.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">When Latasha heard their conversation, she asked with curiosity in her eyes.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;It seems earth has many wondrous things.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Of course.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;When the time comes, I would like to taste the cuisines of earth.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;At that point, I&#x2019;ll treat you to some ramen.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Oh! I will look forward to the ramen.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Sunggoo let out a wicked laugh as he looked at Latasha&apos;s excited face.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;There is a fantastic ramen called the Fire Chicken Fried Noodles. &#xA0;&#xA0;I&apos;ll treat you to it.&quot;<sub>1</sub></span></p><p><span style="">&quot;....&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Jaemin was taken aback by Sunggoo&apos;s words, and his eyes shook. &#xA0;Jaemin discreetly glanced at Latasha, and she still had an excited expression on her face.</span></p><p><span style="">Jaemin looked at Latasha, who was laughing without any pretense. &#xA0;He contrasted it with Sunggoo&#x2019;s face, which was filled with pretense.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I really want to eat it.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Hoo hoo. &#xA0;I will make sure you&apos;ll get to eat it.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Evil. </span></p><p><span style="">Sungoo-hyung had become a demon.</span></p><p><span style="">Jaemin shook his head from side to side.</span></p><p>Translator&apos;s Note:</p><p></p><ol><p></p><p></p><li>&#xA0;Fire Chicken Fried Noodles = the ramen used in the spicy/fire noodle challenge.</li><p></p><p></p></ol><p></p>
