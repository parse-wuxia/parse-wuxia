<p><strong>Chapter 14 Dungeon&#x2019;s Necromancer.</strong></p><p></p><div id="chapterContent" class="innerContent fr-view"><p></p><p><span style="">Chapter 14 &#x2013; Dungeon&#x2019;s Necromancer</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p><p><span style="">(</span><span style="">TLN: Thank you for the donations Colby and Lex. Here is a sponsored chapter. Please turn off adblockers if you are able to~&#xA0;</span><span style="">Thank you and enjoy.)</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ok. Let&#x2019;s go, my minions.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Pah-pahk, pahk!</span></p><p><span style="">At Woojin&#x2019;s call, the 4 corpses of the goblin exploded, and the Skeleton Soldiers was summoned.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ggeegeek.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Keekeekee.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The goblins yelled like surprised monkeys, and the Skeleton Soldier&#x2019;s unique playful sound was also heard. In the middle, Woojin threw away his light club then he took out the claw hammer from his inventory.</span></p><p><span style="">The hammer had enough weight and destructive ability for his purpose. Until he could acquire a proper weapon, he had no choice, but to store it in his inventory for later use.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Well, let&#x2019;s do this.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin started running, and the Skeleton Soldiers ran forward to open a path for their general. The Skeleton Soldiers pressed into the goblins. The hobgoblin was taken aback, and it started to give out a hurried command. The goblins tried to cut off Woojin, but their heads exploded from the claw hammer.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Keekeekeee.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">As soon goblins became dead corpses, Skeleton Soldiers exploded forth from them. Woojin had used a decent amount of Skill Points, so the Skeleton Soldiers could exhibit physical strength comparable to a low ranked Roused.</span></p><p><span style="">Moreover, they weren&#x2019;t easily killed. In a flash, he had 14 creatures, which was the limit of his control. Woojin held up the claw hammer, which was soaked in goblin&#x2019;s blood, towards the shocked hobgoblin.</span></p><p><span style="">The bastard&#x2019;s cane was letting out a crackling sound, and one could see electricity coalesce at the end. His electric attack&#x2019;s cool time had probably ended.</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin used the sharp end of the claw hammer to ram it into hobgoblin&#x2019;s head.</span></p><p><span style="">Kwa-jahk. Pshhhh.</span></p><p><span style="">It pierced through the hobgoblin&#x2019;s skull, and the electricity charged at the end of the cane dissipated before it could be shot.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Whew. This is great for gathering points. It&#x2019;s best to hunt a group of monsters.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Each goblin gave him 2 Achievement points. The hobgoblin gave an astounding 5 points. This was only a 2 star Dungeon, so he could only guess how many points he could get at a high tiered Dungeon.</span></p><p><span style="">He thought about the Magic Scrolls being sold in his Point Store. It seemed it was only a matter of time before he was restored to the heights he had reached at the Alphen Planet.</span></p><p><span style="">The Exp was also pretty good, so he leveled up once.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Party play doesn&#x2019;t suit my style.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">He had Skeleton Soldiers, who could tank in front of him, so he just needed an attack he could deal damage from the back. He&#x2019;ll be able to learn the Skills once he leveled up a little bit more.</span></p><p><span style="">He had passively participated in the party play, so the number of monsters Woojin attacked was low. It slowed him down from earning Exp and Achievement Points.</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin activated his Search Magic as he looked at the fallen goblins. He didn&#x2019;t have go through the hassle of searching all the goblin corpses to find the Blood stones.</span></p><p><span style="">The Seach Magic illuminated any items that possessed Mana. Woojin saw a light leaking out of the fallen hobgoblin&#x2019;s possession, so he searched through it.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Uh? It&#x2019;s a Magic Scroll.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin looked at the Magic Scroll, but he had no way of knowing what kind of magic it was.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I have to learn Identification Magic anyways. I&#x2019;ll just use this as an opportunity to buy it.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin pulled up his Point Store, then he used 20 Achievement Points to learn the &#x2018;Identification&#x2019; magic. He could use 1 star disposable item called Identification Scroll, but he decided to learn how to use this magic. There was no downside since he would be using this magic often.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;-</span></p><p>&lt;Identification&gt;</p><p><span style="">The hidden information of the item will be known to you.</span></p><p><span style="">The failure rate decreases as your Intelligence increases.</span></p><p><span style="">Magic Consumption : 1</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2013;</span></p><p><span style="">As soon as Woojin learned the magic, he casted Identification on the Magic Scroll.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;</span></p><p>&lt;Electric Shock&gt;</p><p><span style="">An electric attack can be sent towards a target.</span></p><p><span style="">Magic Consumption : 1 Latency Time : 20</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2013;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ho oh. This is what the bastard was using.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin searched through his Point Store, and he found the price of the Electric Shock scroll. It was priced at 100 Achievement Points.</span></p><p><span style="">With 30 points, he could buy low ranked elemental magic where he could create a flame or produce water.</span></p><p><span style="">The electric attack was more useful as an attack magic, so he understood why it was 3 times more expensive than the others.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;It&#x2019;s still a middling price.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">He could earn the points if he defeat 50 goblins. If he thought about how fast he dispatched the goblins, it didn&#x2019;t look to be that expensive. However, if he was to buy it, he thought it wasn&#x2019;t cheap either.</span></p><p><span style="">It wasn&#x2019;t something he needed right now, so he put the Magic Scroll away. Then he excavated the blood stones from the goblin&#x2019;s heads as it continued to emit a light.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ooh ooh ooh.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Huh?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin, who was excavating the blood stones, looked around his surrounding when he heard the moan. His face had stiffened, but no monster had appeared. Woojin was alert as he looked around, and his eyes met Sunggoo&#x2019;s pain filled eyes.</span></p><p><span style="">His eyes were moving up and down in agony. It seemed he had regained consciousness. His face was grimacing as if he was still in pain.</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin approached him, and he squatted down next to him. It seemed effects of the Electric Shock&#x2019;s hadn&#x2019;t disappeared yet. Sunggoo forced words out with his stiff tongue.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;H, help m&#x2026;.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;How much did you see?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin cut off Sunggoo as he asked a question. Sunggoo looked up with a pleading expression, but Woojin&#x2019;s face was indifferent.</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin had seen countless number of people die. This included comrades, and enemies he had met. Moreover, he had also seen innocent fallen souls being stolen.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ah, I don&#x2019;t care.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">This wasn&#x2019;t Alphen Planet. He didn&#x2019;t really need to kill Sunggoo. He wasn&#x2019;t a spy from a hostile country, so silencing him wasn&#x2019;t a necessity.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;P..please save me.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">He was slowly gaining control of his tonue, so Sunggoo&#x2019;s words became clearer. Sunggoo was someone who had the ability to make fireballs. He was someone who dealt in magic, so he was somewhat resistant to magic.</span></p><p><span style="">If he was a civilian and not a Roused, he would already be dead. However, if he was left here, then he&#x2019;ll surely be kill by the monsters downstairs .</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What will you do for me if I save you?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I&#x2019;ll keep my mouth shut.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;About what?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;The fact that big brother is a Rank D Roused.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin smirked at Sunggoo&#x2019;s words. It seemed one had to be a Rank D Roused to easily defeat a hobgoblin and a couple dozen goblins.</span></p><p><span style="">Still, he didn&#x2019;t really care if his story was spread. Woojin wasn&#x2019;t interested in such things.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;How much are you willing to give me?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Is this how one felt when one couldn&#x2019;t say anything from being too flustered? Hong-songgoo didn&#x2019;t know how he should answer the question, so he hesitated.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;If I leave you here, then you&#x2019;ll probably become like him?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin pointed towards the bloody corpse of Jongchul. He had been beaten by the goblin&#x2019;s club in numerous locations, so he was a gruesome sight to behold.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I&#x2026;I&#x2019;ll give it to you.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">If he could live, then how could the money be a problem? He&#x2019;ll take out his entire savings if he was able to live. Money was something he could earn more as he increased in the Roused ranks.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;How&#x2026;how much do you want?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">At Sunggoo&#x2019;s word, Woojin unfurled two fingers. Sunggoo was surprised, and he gritted his teeth.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;If it&#x2019;s 2 thousand then it is well worth my life.&#x2019; (TLN:2??? around $18,000)</span></p><p><span style="">He&#x2019;ll be spending all the money he had saved, but it didn&#x2019;t matter. He had just started his life as a Roused, so he&#x2019;ll make much more in the future.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I understand.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin smiled in satisfaction at Sunggoo&#x2019;s reply.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;If its 2 hundred then I&#x2019;ll have enough entrance fee for Solo Play.&#x2019; (TLN: ~$1,800)</span></p><p><span style="">This was his 3rd day back.</span></p><p><span style="">Roused Kang-woojin was still naive.</span></p><p></p></div><p></p>
