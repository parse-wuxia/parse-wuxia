<p><span style="">Epilogue</span></p><p><span style="">The subway stations had become a means for the monsters to pour into this world.</span></p><p><span style="">Humanity had to fight for their survival, and they had done pretty well in the fight.</span></p><p><span style="">Still, a population that was about to reach 7 billion was reduced to half its size in just 5 years.</span></p><p><span style="">The monsters appeared in the world, while following certain sets of rules.</span></p><p><span style="">Humanity explored the Dungeons, and they obtained a profitable result. &#xA0;They started taking advantage of the situation.</span></p><p><span style="">They went wild over a new resource called Bloodstones, but soon they were hit with a bigger tragedy.</span></p><p><span style="">Trahnet and earth had completely synchronized.</span></p><p><span style="">Afterwards, &#xA0;the Dimensional lords, who were indiscriminate about their killings, had appeared. &#xA0;They were on track to take ownership of earth.</span></p><p><span style="">It was rare to see a country, who hadn&#x2019;t lost their capital, and about half the countries of the world lost their government. &#xA0;The people of these countries turned into refugees.</span></p><p><span style="">Monsters....</span></p><p><span style="">One couldn&#x2019;t simply categorize all of them as monsters. &#xA0;Many different types of life forms gathered on earth.</span></p><p><span style="">There were humanoid races like Elves, Dwarves and Orcs. &#xA0;There were even humans&#x2026;.</span></p><p><span style="">The tens or hundreds of new species had been about to fight an endless battle to take possession of earth.</span></p><p><span style="">However, all the Dungeons had been Reset.</span></p><p><span style="">It was a clean Reset.</span></p><p><span style="">The Dungeons, which had acted as Dimensional tunnels, disappeared. &#xA0;Humanity once again had hope.</span></p><p><span style="">It looked as if peace could be achieved once the invaders, who were the Dimensional Refugees, were driven out.</span></p><p><span style="">While the Dimensional war was over, the battle to seize earth remained. &#xA0;A war where the Dimensional refugees would have to fight the original owners of earth remained. &#xA0;It was a battle for their survival.</span></p><p><span style="">The population was being categorized as either being humans or monsters. &#xA0;However, this identification of friend or foe was an ambiguous process, and it seemed another period of bloodshed was imminent.</span></p><p><span style="">However, Alandal intervened to stop the war. &#xA0;They forcefully brought about peace.</span></p><p><span style="">Of course, not all countries and Dimensional refugees agreed with the decision.</span></p><p><span style="">Japan disagreed with Alandal&#x2019;s decision. &#xA0;They started a war with the Dark Elves living in Hokkaido. &#xA0;Japan lost in a brutal manner.</span></p><p><span style="">It wasn&#x2019;t a battle where each side poured their forces into all-out war.</span></p><p><span style="">The minister of Japan was the first to fall. &#xA0;All the members of the government, who pursued this war, were assassinated. &#xA0;&#xA0;The war fizzled out.</span></p><p><span style="">Anyone, who talked about starting the war, was killed the next day. &#xA0;The battle never came to be.</span></p><p><span style="">It wasn&#x2019;t as if the Dimensional refugees were exempt from the violence. &#xA0;If they showed any signs of invading a country, they received a ruthless punishment.</span></p><p><span style="">God of Destruction.</span></p><p><span style="">His name was slowly spread across the races, who took root on earth. &#xA0;His name was carved into the consciousness of each and every one of them. &#xA0;&#xA0;Under his reign, peace returned.</span></p><p><span style="">However, not all the problems could be solved through controlled responses to those trying to start a war. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">The secret terrorist activities and land disputes occurred constantly.</span></p><p><span style="">The other intelligent races on earth was a problem. &#xA0;&#xA0;There needed to be an expedient way to solve the disputes.</span></p><p><span style="">Therefore, it was a given that a United Earth Coalition was formed with its strongest country as the centerpiece. &#xA0;Alandal was chosen to be the mediator.</span></p><p><span style="">However, the one to spearhead this problem wasn&#x2019;t the king of Alandal Kahng-woojin. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">The first chairman of the United Earth Coalition, which would be pursuing world peace, was none other than Alandal&#x2019;s Prime Minister Jung-minchan.</span></p><p><span style="">The amount of Dimensional refugees equalled the number of humans killed in the Dimensional war. &#xA0;The peace was forged through a hard fought effort that spanned a year.</span></p><p><span style="">Destruction and Slaughter.</span></p><p><span style="">The people of earth was freed from the threat of war and terror. &#xA0;This sweet period of time had been peaceful, and it was enough time for the name of the god of destruction to fade from the memories of the people.</span></p><p><span style="">It didn&#x2019;t matter how many humans and monsters he had killed. &#xA0;It didn&#x2019;t matter how many beings were killed by his Undead army.</span></p><p><span style="">He was the reigning absolute being, who had severed the tethers linking earth to the different dimensions. </span></p><p><span style="">Kahng-woojin wasn&#x2019;t the god of destruction. &#xA0;He had become the hero of earth.</span></p><p><span style="">He was to be revered instead of feared. &#xA0;However, his whereabout was unknown for the past couple months</span></p><p><span style="">Several thousand people were gathered on a sunny spring day, and they were looking up at the platform. &#xA0;Several dozen camera drones were floating in the air, and the speech was being broadcasted to the world.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;It is unfortunate that I cannot share this historic day with him.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Jung-minchan looked as if he had aged 10 years. &#xA0;It seemed he had received a lot of stress in the past year. &#xA0;He spoke with a calm voice into the microphone.</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;It has been an year, since we&#x2019;ve established the United Earth Coalition.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Some called it the Dimensional Independence day. &#xA0;Others call that day the start of a new era.</span></p><p><span style="">It had been a year, since the new history of earth began anew.</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;Today is also a historic day where we will meet humans from the old world.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Michan stepped back from the podium as he pointed behind him. &#xA0;The Seoul Station was behind him.</span></p><p><span style="">The real world had overlapped with the VR world.</span></p><p><span style="">There was no reason to differentiate between the VR and the Reality..</span></p><p><span style="">The two very different world had merged to create a new reality.</span></p><p><span style="">Instead of the Dungeons, humans were found sleeping inside the subway stations. &#xA0;They were within capsules. &#xA0;They dreamed as they waited for a new home.</span></p><p><span style="">For the past year, the United Earth Coalition brought order to the world, and they were successful in brokering peace between the different races.</span></p><p><span style="">They had built centers on each continent that&#x2019;ll help people, who will awaken from stasis, adjust to this new world. &#xA0;The people, who will be conducting the rescue operations, had also finished their training.</span></p><p><span style="">The humans from the old world, who were immersed in the fantasy of their dreams, would be called back into reality.</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;We will now start this project. &#xA0;We will be rescue the people of the old world.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">At Minchan&#x2019;s declaration, the people cheered.</span></p><p><span style="">It didn&#x2019;t matter that the creations would be meeting the creators. &#xA0;It was merely humans rescuing other humans.</span></p><p><span style="">***</span></p><p><span style="">Vrrrrrrrrm.</span></p><p><span style="">A van was racing down the road.</span></p><p><span style="">Click.</span></p><p><span style="">Cindy turned off the tv screen, which was broadcasting Minchan&#x2019;s speech. &#xA0;She leaned back into her seat.</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;Jiwon always has a knack for scheduling these events at odd times.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">It was the one year anniversary of the start of the new era, and people were out to meet the people of the old world. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">Jiwon decided to do a fan meeting on such a day.</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;Shall I turn the car around?&quot;</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;Who will go if I don&#x2019;t go? &#xA0;Everyone is busy today.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">All their friends and acquaintances were busy today. &#xA0;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">Cindy was a world-class singer, but Jiwon&#x2019;s circle of friends were only full of incredible people&#x2026;.</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;Will Soonghoon oppa be able to come today?&quot;</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;Huh? I think Mr. Soonghoon is on live broadcast today.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">At the manager&#x2019;s words, Do-jiwon turned on her tv again.</span></p><p><span style="">Click.</span></p><p><span style=""> &lt;World Variety Woo-soonghoon Show! &#xA0;Today is a special day. &#xA0;I&#x2019;m interviewing a very important guest today. &#xA0;Please give an applause for the professor. &#xA0;He is Dr. Toppler from the Moon base.&gt;</span></p><p><span style="">On the screen, the panel gave an applause as Dr. Toppler appeared with a broad smile on his face.</span></p><p><span style=""> &lt;You are our first alien, who arrived on our earth without riding in on a UFO. &#xA0;Or should I call you the man from the future?&gt;</span></p><p><span style="">At Woo-soonghoon&#x2019;s joke, the panel and the professor laughed. &#xA0;Then they started exchanging stories.</span></p><p><span style="">The fact that it was a joke didn&#x2019;t mean it was a falsehood.</span></p><p><span style="">Toppler had been on earth on that historic day.</span></p><p><span style=""> &lt;Please tell us more about what happened that day, professor.&gt;</span></p><p><span style=""> &lt;It was a unique event that will never be seen again. &#xA0;In truth, I&#x2019;m still having a hard time believing it happened even now.&gt;</span></p><p><span style=""> &lt;Does this look like an illusion? &#xA0;Do you want to wake up from this dream? &#xA0;Have you been hypnotized?&gt;</span></p><p><span style=""> Dr. Toppler laughed at Woo-soonghoon&#x2019;s flippant attitude, and he continued to speak.</span></p><p><span style=""> &lt;No way. &#xA0;I&#x2019;m just saying having a closed mind is a scary thing. &#xA0;We found out that the distinction between reality and illusion might be meaningless. &#xA0;When one puts one&#x2019;s belief into a thought, it could be brought into reality. &#xA0;On the flip side, forgetfulness might lead to the erasure of many things.&gt;</span></p><p><span style=""> &lt;You are very philosophical today. &#xA0;How are the aliens on the Moon Base doing these days?&gt;</span></p><p><span style=""> &lt;Haha. &#xA0;It is the same as always. &#xA0;They are showing a lot of interest in the project of rescuing the people from the old world. &#xA0;Moreover, It is almost time for the probe to land on Mars, so everyone is focused more on that event.&gt;</span></p><p><span style=""> &lt;How about you, professor....&gt;</span></p><p><span style="">Click.</span></p><p><span style="">Cindy turned off the screen, and she closed her tired eyes.</span></p><p><span style=""> There were several dozen different races existing on earth now. </span></p><p><span style="">Woo-soonghoon was able to converse with all of them.</span></p><p><span style="">He was fast with his word so much so that he had been able to sell an old phone to the god of destruction. &#xA0;He had used the Passive Skill he possessed to become a world famous talk show host. His success wasn&#x2019;t a fluke.</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;Uh-whew. &#xA0;Soonghoon oppa can&#x2019;t come&#x2026;.&quot;</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;Why don&#x2019;t you try asking your boyfriend?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">At the manager&#x2019;s words, Cindy furrowed her brows.</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;Uh-whew. &#xA0;Why would the world&#x2019;s busiest jobless person pick up my call?&quot;</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;Pfft..&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Her manager laughed at her reply.</span></p><p><span style="">Ddoo-roo-roo-roo.</span></p><p><span style="">Unlike her words, Cindy tried calling him, yet the phone kept ringing. &#xA0;There was no sign that the phone would be picked up.</span></p><p><span style="">Kwah-ahng, doo-doohng.</span></p><p><span style="">At that moment, the car rocked and vibrated. &#xA0;When she looked out the window, she saw the roof of a building billowing with smoke.</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;Aigo. &#xA0;It seems it is another terrorist attack.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">The terrorists weren&#x2019;t affiliated with any specific country, so it was a problem that the United Earth Coalition was having a hard time solving.</span></p><p><span style="">Moreover, Kahng-woojin had hidden his whereabouts recently, and it had emboldened the terrorists.</span></p><p><span style="">Hwah-roo-roohk!</span></p><p><span style="">The flames were burning black as it climbed up the building. &#xA0;It headed towards the roof of the building. &#xA0;Cindy&#x2019;s eyes turned round as her eyes laughed in amusement.</span></p><p><span style=""> Hwah-roo-roo-roohk.</span></p><p><span style="">The black smoke gathered, and it was sent away in a stream towards the sky. &#xA0;The flames acted as if it was being sucked into a blackhole. &#xA0;The flames gathered to form a phoenix.</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;He really is the busiest one of them all.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">The phone was still ringing, but Cindy ended the call.</span></p><p><span style="">The fact that he was in Korea made her heart race in an odd manner.</span></p><p><span style=""> The man of flame fought the terrorists, and he didn&#x2019;t take any money for his services.</span></p><p><span style="">He was the world&#x2019;s hottest jobless person, and he was her boyfriend.</span></p><p><span style="">It seems she would be able to see his face today.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I want you to cancel everything from my schedule from tonight to tomorrow.&quot;</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;What?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">The manager was surprised, but she had requested numerous times before. &#xA0;Therefore, the manager assented.</span></p><p><span style="">He took a peek at the black mirrors, and he saw Cindy smiling like a teen.</span></p><p><span style="">***</span></p><p><span style="">Ssssk.</span></p><p><span style="">A deft hand was signing her name within the cover of the book.</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;You are too pretty.&quot;</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;Ha ha. Yes.&quot;</span></p><p><span style=""> She liked the compliment, so she smiled as she shook the man&#x2019;s hand.</span></p><p><span style="">The next reader in line came up to her as he pushed the book forward.</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;What is your name?&quot;</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;Spotted Dog.&quot;</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;.......&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">The elegant movement of the pen came to a stop.</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;What did you just say?&quot;</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;I&#x2019;m Spotted Dog.&quot;</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;Huhk.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Do-jiwon shot to her feet.</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;Y...you are the one in the comments&#x2026;.&quot;</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;I always planned on dropping your novel, but I always wondered about what would happen in the next chapter&#x2026; &#xA0;I kept reading it&#x2026;. &#xA0;Again and again&#x2026; &#xA0;I entered into the fan meeting lottery for fun, and I was picked&#x2026;..&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">He scratched his head as he acted stand-offish. &#xA0;However, Do-jiwon still had a bright smile on her face. &#xA0;She had written 200 chapters to her book, and he had commented on every single one of them. &#xA0;She had never expected to see him here.</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;It is so good to meet you&quot;</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;Really?&quot;</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;I was really curious about you. &#xA0;Heh heh&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Do-jiwon&#x2019;s smile was pure. &#xA0;The man with the name, Spotted Dog, on his nametag felt awkward by her eager greeting.</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;I really wanted to say something to you.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">If she wanted to speak to him, why didn&#x2019;t she write it in the afterward of her book?</span></p><p><span style="">Do-jiwon had a bright smile as she bowed towards the confused man.</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;I&apos;m really thankful to you. &#xA0;You motivated me greatly..&quot;</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;Hmm hmm.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">He was unnecessarily clearing his throat when he caught sight of Cindy. &#xA0;She ignored the long line of readers waiting in line for their chance to meet the author.</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;Jiwon! &#xA0;Congratulations on finishing your book!&quot;</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;Uh? Hey, Cindy.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Jiwon was surprised by Cindy&#x2019;s appearance, and the people waiting in line whispered to each other.</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;Isn&#x2019;t that Cindy?&quot;</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;Uh? &#xA0;It really is her. &#xA0;I heard they were friends, but they look really close.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Jiwon sat back down as she looked at the gossiping people.</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;Ms. Haesol and Jaemin is here inside the waiting room.&quot;</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;All right. &#xA0;You should hurry up and finish this. &#xA0;I&#x2019;ll be waiting for you.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Cindy bowed towards the readers in line, then she headed towards the waiting room provided as a convenience for the busy Jiwon.</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;Aigo. &#xA0;You should just sit, my little muffin.&quot;</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;No, my back hurt when I sit.&quot;</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;Uh-whew. &#xA0;What should we do about this?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Familiar voices could be heard across the door of the waiting room. &#xA0;Cindy smirked as she opened the door.</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;Uh? &#xA0;Noona.&quot;</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;Unni!&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Do-jaemin turned around in surprise. &#xA0;Soolgi was also surprised, but she greeted Cindy with a welcoming smile.</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;Hmmph hmmph. &#xA0;You are here?&quot;</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;Yes.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">It seemed Cindy had intruded, while Jaemin and Soolgi was acting lovey dovey with each other. &#xA0;Haesol looked very grateful that Cindy had come in. &#xA0;Haesol grabbed her hand in greeting.</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;Unni!&quot;</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;Uh-whew, girl. &#xA0;Are you in you third trimester?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Cindy looked at the very pregnant stomach of Soolgi.</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;Yes. &#xA0;The baby is expected next month on the 12th.&quot;</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;Why didn&#x2019;t you stay home?&quot;</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;Eh-ee. &#xA0;This is Jiwon-unni&#x2019;s fan meeting. &#xA0;I can&#x2019;t skip this.&quot;</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;Aigo. &#xA0;Is it because she is your sister-in-law?&quot;</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;Uh-muh. &#xA0;No way.&quot;</span></p><p><span style=""> Do-jaemin laughed with his eyes. &#xA0;It was heartwarming to see this reunion.</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;Are you that happy about becoming a father?&quot;</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;Heh heh. &#xA0;I love it.&quot;</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;Aigo. &#xA0;Do you think Woojin&#x2019;s arrived?&quot;</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;You mean hyung? &#xA0;Hyung can&#x2019;t make it here. &#xA0;He is too far away.&quot;</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;Of course, I know he can&apos;t make it here. &#xA0;I&#x2019;m asking if you think he has arrived there yet.&quot;</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;Uh....... Mmm. &#xA0;I&#x2019;m not sure.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">At Do-jaemin&#x2019;s words, Cindy let out a dumbfounded laugh.</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;Aigo. &#xA0;What can we expect from this sexy idiot?&quot;</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;Heh heh.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Jaemin felt great even though he heard her rebuke.</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;It is useless to worry about Woojin-hyung. He probably arrived there safely. &#xA0;Heh.&quot;</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;Of course....&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">There was nothing on earth&#x2026;. &#xA0;No, there was nothing in the Solar System that could threaten Kahng-woojin. &#xA0;It was a waste of energy to worry about him.</span></p><p><span style="">***</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;We are on track to enter the atmosphere of Mars. &#xA0;We are approaching it slowly.&quot;</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;Mmm. &#xA0;All right. &#xA0;Contact the headquarters.&quot;</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;Yes, sir.&quot;</span></p><p><span style=""> Beep!</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;This is January 5th of year 1 N.E.(New Era) &#xA0;Leone&#x2019;s ship was able to enter the atmosphere at 11 hundred hours. &#xA0;We will revolve around the planet as we start our exploration.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">The party members worked busily as Captain Leone walked away. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;Hoo-ooh.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Leone had gone through many hardship, but he always trembled when he had to go meet the man.</span></p><p><span style="">Beep.</span></p><p><span style="">A doorbell like button was pressed, and a voice was heard from a small speaker.</span></p><p><span style=""> &lt;Enter.&gt;</span></p><p><span style="">Psshng!</span></p><p><span style="">The door opened automatically, and Leone walked in. &#xA0;He stood in front of Kahng-woojin.</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;Hoo-oohk.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin had been doing handstand pushups. &#xA0;Woojin dropped to the floor, and he wiped the sweat away.</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;What is it?&quot;</span></p><p><span style=""> Leone maintained his stiff posture as he gave his report.</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;We&apos;ve successfully entered the atmosphere of Mars. &#xA0;I thought we should revolve around the planet for a scan. &#xA0;After we conduct a clean research, we can send the landing module&#x2026;.&quot;</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;Ah, you should have just stopped at the first sentence.&quot;</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;.......&quot;</span></p><p><span style=""> Woojin wiped the sweat away from his head as he grinned.</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;So we&#x2019;ve arrived?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin walked out of the room, and Leone followed after him.</span></p><p><span style="">Something was amiss. &#xA0;This man always made things happen.</span></p><p><span style="">Across the thick window, he could see a blue planet.</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin&#x2019;s eyes shone brightly.</span></p><p><span style="">Trahnet was gone&#x2026; &#xA0;In a world where the Portals were gone, spaceships were the only way to travel between planets.</span></p><p><span style="">Thanks to the advance technology of the Moon World, it had taken him only several months to get here.</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;Finally, we are here.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin&#x2019;s eyes was filled with great joy.</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;We are at Alphen.&quot;</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;.......&quot;</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;Open the door.&quot;</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;What? &#xA0;We&#x2019;ll have to survey the place, while in orbit&#x2026;.&quot;</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;Shall I just break open the door?&quot;</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;......we&#x2019;ll make preparations.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Leone knew this was a losing proposition, so he turned around.</span></p><p><span style="">The preparation was finished in short order&#x2026;. &#xA0;The landing module shot out from the spaceship.</span></p><p><span style="">Pshhhhng!</span></p><p><span style="">The landing module slowly broke apart in stages as the gravity of Mars accelerated the speed of the landing module. </span></p><p><span style="">It was designed to withstand the heat and pressure of the descent, but it broke apart after a minute.</span></p><p><span style="">Ggwahhhhhng!</span></p><p><span style="">The exploding fragments were letting out flame as it fell. &#xA0;Accompanying the explosion, something white expanded.</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;Mmm.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Leone swallowed a moan as he saw the Bone Dragon rip out of the landing module.</span></p><p><span style="">Leone didn&#x2019;t have to even look at Woojin&#x2019;s expression to tell he was excited. &#xA0;He could imagine what Woojin looked like as he headed towards Mars on the back of the Bone Dragon.</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;We&#x2019;ll maintain our orbi. &#xA0;Let&#x2019;s launch the observation satellite.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Mars.... No, this place had been Terraformed alongside earth. &#xA0;It was time to do an earnest exploration of Alphen.</span></p><p><span style="">The Bone Dragon with Woojin on its back stopped its rapid descent. &#xA0;It started gliding across the sky.</span></p><p><span style="">The Portal was gone, but he had promised that he&#x2019;ll return.</span></p><p><span style=""> He did it for the person waiting for him&#x2026;.</span></p>
