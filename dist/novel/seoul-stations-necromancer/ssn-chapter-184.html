<p><span style="">Chapter 184 - Descendant of a Dragon (2)</span></p><p><span style="">The flame in front of the World Tree had grown.</span></p><p><span style="">It looked like a black flame. &#xA0;The color looked to be the manifestation of impure blood.</span></p><p><span style="">When one got closer, one could see the evil spirits swimming around it. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">Within the black flame, one could see a white flame burning within.</span></p><p><span style="">There was a Dragon&apos;s Heart slowly melting away, and the white flame was using the Dragon&apos;s Heart as fuel.</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin had already sat in front of the burning fire for well over 10 days. &#xA0;He was focused solely on the evil spirits, so he didn&apos;t have the time to take stock of what was going on around him.</span></p><p><span style="">It was a private battle that drew the attention of the people around Woojin. &#xA0;However, when it continued on for over 10 days, the heroes of the Coalition started focusing on their assigned roles.</span></p><p><span style="">It would have been great if Woojin fixed the Colony using his god-like power, but he was too busy. &#xA0;So the Coalition had to fix the place themselves.</span></p><p><span style="">It took them 20 days to roughly secure the surrounding.</span></p><p><span style="">The corpses of tens of thousands of monsters were gathered in a single location, and an enormous mountain was transformed from it. &#xA0;One could see blood stained patches in various locations on the mountain.</span></p><p><span style="">The Immortal stayed steadfastly in place, but his Undead Army was razing the nearby regions as they slaughtered all the monsters.</span></p><p><span style="">Their activities allowed the people of the Coalition, who had been barely hanging on by a thread by hiding, to gather in droves around the Saurus mountain.</span></p><p><span style="">However, there were still a lot of suspicious people, who thought this was a trap made by some Dimensional lord. &#xA0;So they weren&#x2019;t rash in coming to the mountain. &#xA0;This was why the heroes of the Coalition had to expand their base of operation as they rescued the people. &#xA0;They were steadily growing their forces.</span></p><p><span style="">The Phantom Unit being led by Blanka and Che-haesol was also achieving great results in Alphen.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;It has been awhile, yet the rear troops haven&apos;t come through yet.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;....Hmmm. &#xA0;We might be the last one to cross.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Supporting troops had been sent in an effort to save Alphen.</span></p><p><span style="">Kahng-woojin, Hong-sunggoo and Do-jaemin had been the first wave, and the Phantom unit was the second wave to arrive. &#xA0;Everyone was a member of Alandal.</span></p><p><span style="">Whether it was to exploit or putting a prescence on Alphen, many guilds from various countries wanted to come to Alphen. &#xA0;However, none of them had show up yet.</span></p><p><span style="">Either they gave up on coming here themselves, or there was a reason why they weren&apos;t able to come here.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;It seems something grave may be happening on earth....&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Hong-sunggoo lay near death, and Do-jaemin quickly returned to earth using the Gate. &#xA0;Their king hadn&apos;t moved an inch after sitting in front of the flame, so they couldn&apos;t even ask him questions. &#xA0;Their curiosity was driving them nuts.</span></p><p><span style="">They had several &#xA0;suspicions, yet they had no choice, but to wait.</span></p><p><span style="">They decided to stick to the initial plan. &#xA0;The Phantom Unit trained as they helped the Coalition.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I&apos;m a little bit worried. &#xA0;What if we aren&apos;t able to go back home?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I&apos;ll be ok, Blanka. &#xA0;Do you doubt our king? &#xA0;If there is no roads, he&apos;ll pave one himself.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Hoo-ooh. &#xA0;My mother sometimes appears in my dreams. &#xA0;I&apos;m really worried.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;....&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Haesol calmly soothed Blanka, then she went to meet Tauric.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Ah, Captain Haesol. &#xA0;What can I do for you?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Tauric welcomed her. &#xA0;Even amongst the freaks that came over from earth with the Immortal, Haesol and the Phantom unit was a bit special. &#xA0;They worked very well together, and they were very good at carrying out missions.</span></p><p><span style="">They were a group that specialized in search and rescue.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Have you found the Holy Maiden yet?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Hmm... &#xA0;We are trying our best, but we haven&apos;t found her yet.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Aside from the people from Alandal, the Phantom Unit was most familiar with Holy Maiden Melody in the Coalition. &#xA0;She had already been missing for several dozen days.</span></p><p><span style="">She had left with Kahng-woojin to find Aria&apos;s Temple, yet she hadn&apos;t returned yet.</span></p><p><span style="">Several cynics spread a false rumor that Melody had been murdered by the Immortal.</span></p><p><span style="">Since the accused couldn&apos;t defend himself, there was no way they could completely dismiss such a claim...</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Tauric!&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Latasha lightly ran down the road leading from the castle walls, and she came to a stop in front of them. &#xA0;There was an excited expression on her face as if she had met an old friend. Her face was flushed.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;The Holy Maiden of Aria is back!&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Oh oh. &#xA0;Really?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;She is coming up from the base of the mountain.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;It seems all the spirits within Alphen is trying to help us.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Since the Holy Maiden was back, she would be able to cure those, who weren&#x2019;t recovering from their wounds. &#xA0;She was basically like a savior sent by the gods.</span></p><p><span style="">There was no one, who could rival Melody in terms of Holy Power. &#xA0;Moreover, since she had acquired Aria&apos;s Holy Item, her power would have grown much stronger.</span></p><p><span style="">The gathered heroes ran down to greet the Holy Maiden of Aria. &#xA0;They went to greet her with a happy heart. &#xA0;A big crowd was gathered around her to celebrate her return, but when they caught sight of her, Melody didn&apos;t have a bright expression on her face.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;What happened, Voice of Aria?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Skia&apos;s Monk.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Melody&apos;s voice somehow sounded sorrowful.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;The Immortal was short on time, so he went ahead of me. &#xA0;I just followed behind...&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Oh oh. &#xA0;Is that so? &#xA0;You went through a lot of hardship. &#xA0;You did very well.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Even as Tauric fiercely greeted Melody, he immediately ask her for a favor. &#xA0;Since he was the leader, he had to deliver the difficult messages. &#xA0;It was the right thing to do.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I know you&#x2019;ve just arrived, so I&#x2019;m being shameless. &#xA0;However, there are people crying out from pain. &#xA0;Could you give them the Blessing of Aria?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Of course.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Melody let out a weak laugh as she followed after Tauric..</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I want to welcome you back.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I am so happy that you came back safely.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Thank you, Holy Maiden.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">She was being congratulated by the people, but she barely smiled. &#xA0;Her smile indicated that she was uncomfortable with something.</span></p><p><span style="">***</span></p><p><span style="">It seemed as if Woojin would wake up in a short amount of time, but 20 days had passed. &#xA0;He wasn&apos;t showing any signs of waking up.</span></p><p><span style="">Many people wondered how a person could live without moving or eating. &#xA0;However, if one thought about the Immortal&apos;s past exploits, this was nothing.</span></p><p><span style="">Moreover, people were more worried about the state of the planet than him.</span></p><p><span style="">The political landscape of this continent had gone through a seismic change.</span></p><p><span style="">The Immortal had re-appeared, and the fractured Coalition was being rebuilt. &#xA0;Moreover, the Dimensional lords, who had taken over almost the entirety of Alphen, were being taken down.</span></p><p><span style="">The Undead army had swept through the battlefield, and they had already cleared a wide area. &#xA0;They had cleared about one third of the planet.</span></p><p><span style="">In other words, even as this large area was being pacified, the Immortal hadn&#x2019;t woken up.</span></p><p><span style="">He stayed in place to protect the waning flame of a life.</span></p><p><span style="">A woman was watching the Immortal.</span></p><p><span style="">&apos;Immortal.&apos;</span></p><p><span style="">Melody looked at the nearly melted Dragon&apos;s Heart, the small flame, the black evil spirits, and Kahng-woojin. &#xA0;He was sitting in front of these elements, and she monitored the situation. </span></p><p><span style="">&apos;Oh goddess. &#xA0;How could you give me such a tribulation.&apos;</span></p><p><span style="">She felt resentment.</span></p><p><span style="">After giving everything of herself to her goddess, this was the first time Melody felt resentment towards her goddess. &#xA0;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">Melody couldn&apos;t understand the latest oracle.</span></p><p><span style="">-You have to burn the World Tree for Alphen.</span></p><p><span style="">They were barely able to bloom this Symbol, which had become the hope of the Coalition. &#xA0;Yet she had to burn it with her own hands? &#xA0;Moreover, this was the last gate leading to Kahng-woojin&apos;s Dimensional Domain.</span></p><p><span style="">If the gate was destroyed, he&apos;ll be trapped in Alphen. &#xA0;He&apos;ll be trapped here until he could gain another Dungeon.</span></p><p><span style="">It wasn&apos;t as if she didn&apos;t know what her goddess was aiming for. &#xA0;However, she questioned whether such an action was just.</span></p><p><span style="">She felt tormented.</span></p><p><span style="">The feelings inside her heart fought each other to fill her with anguish and suffering. &#xA0;It was a big burden for her.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;What are you doing here?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;...!&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Melody was so surprised that her heart almost jumped out of her chest.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Hic.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;What&apos;s up?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Kahng-woojin smirked when he saw the hiccuping Melody.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Are you a pervert? &#xA0;Why are you spying on me?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I...I&apos;m not a pervert. &#xA0;Hic.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Melody&apos;s face was red for no reason, and she couldn&apos;t look straight into Woojin eyes. &#xA0;She was feeling embarrassment, guilt and sorriness. &#xA0;Moreover, her heart was &#xA0;pounding....</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;What made you move right now...&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Melody took a glance behind him, and she couldn&apos;t locate the evil spirits nor the Dragon&apos;s Heart. &#xA0;The only thing left behind was a small red and white flame. &#xA0;It was lighting up the surrounding like a candle.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Well, I pretty much did all I can.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;How&apos;s Sunggoo-nim doing?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;It is all up to him now. &#xA0;Ah. &#xA0;I hope he comes out ok.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;.....?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Melody&apos;s eyes turned round.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;What do you mean..?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;He&apos;s being reborn without experiencing death. &#xA0;He&apos;ll probably come out after remolding himself a little bit.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;....?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Melody was still confused by his words, so her puzzled expression refused to leave her face. &#xA0;Woojin changed the topic.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Give me your Holy Item.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;....&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Melody hesitated. &#xA0;As soon as he got up, he was asking for her Holy Item....</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Hurry up and give it to me.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I...I lost it.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Hmmm.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin suddenly pushed his face towards Melody, and he looked straight into her eyes.</span></p><p><span style="">She didn&apos;t have the courage to look into the fathomless depth of his eyes, so she lowered her head.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Well, all right.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin backed off without making much of a fuss.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I want it found before I get back.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">He still had one more Holy Item to acquire besides Aria&apos;s Holy Item.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;W...where are you going?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Is he going back to earth? &#xA0;What if he never returned to Alphen?</span></p><p><span style="">She looked at him with worried eyes, but Woojin spoke in an offhand manner. </span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Where else? &#xA0;I need to go catch Heres&apos; follower.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">The five Holy Items were sub-ingredients for the Thrash&apos;s Set Items.</span></p><p><span style="">He just needed the ingredient for the belt. &#xA0;Afterwards, his task would be complete once he received Aria&#x2019;s Circlet. &#xA0;The other Ingredient Items were co across different Dimensions, so he could just use his Points to purchase it.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Ah. &#xA0;I want you to protect the Colony until I get back.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;....&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Why aren&apos;t you answering me?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Yes?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Then I&apos;ll be putting my trust in you.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;....&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">When Woojin walked away, Melody was alone. &#xA0;The strength in her legs drained out of her, and &#xA0;she sat on the ground as if she was collapsing.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Oh goddess....&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Her anguish deepened.</span></p><p><span style="">***</span></p><p><span style="">Ggee-ahhhhhk! </span></p><p><span style="">The Wyvern&apos;s screech stabbed at her ears.</span></p><p><span style="">Shwahhhh.</span></p><p><span style="">She would have preferred a Dragon&apos;s roar. &#xA0;She was used to the sound of the wind brushing by her ears, so the sound of the Wyverns was painful to the Elf.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;W...why do I have to go with you?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">The headwind was making her skin scrunch up. &#xA0;The poor elf complained about her unfair situation.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;You were the only one, who looked completely free.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">The Immortal spoke in an off hand manner as if her troubles were over nothing. &#xA0;Latasha&#x2019;s clenched fists shook.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;...of course, I have things to do!&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;The one that has least to do has to become my guide.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;....why do you keep insisting I was doing nothing?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Am I on the right path?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">The surface of the ground was passing by quickly. &#xA0;When Woojin indirectly asked her a question, she looked around in a disgruntled fashion before she spoke.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Over there. &#xA0;You have to go past the rock mountain.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;The one with the best eyesight has to be my guide.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;....&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">She couldn&apos;t refute the Immortal&apos;s argument, so she kept biting at her blameless lips.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;God of time...&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Five gods had the Master Codes of Alphen.</span></p><p><span style="">He&apos;ll have the last Holy Item in couple days.</span></p><p><span style="">***</span></p><p><span style="">Sizzle sizzle.</span></p><p><span style="">The meat was spitting out fat as it cooked deliciously over the campfire.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Wow. It looks incredibly delicious.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Six children were gathered in a small group.</span></p><p><span style="">They were sitting around the fire with meat skewers in their hands. &#xA0;When the meat was done, one of the children started chewing on it.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Oh wow. &#xA0;It is really tasty!&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Wow. &#xA0;You&#x2019;re right.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">All the children started taking a bite out of the meat, and they had a happy expression on their faces. &#xA0;Up until now, the children had been busy trying to follow the adults as they fled for safety.</span></p><p><span style="">However, they were very quick to adjust to anything thrown at them. &#xA0;The very first change that happened when they arrived at the Saurus mountain was the fact that smiles returned to their faces. &#xA0;Laughters of children erupted from within the mountain.</span></p><p><span style="">One child spoke in a boastful manner.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I heard it from my mom.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;What did she say?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I heard the Flame Spirit King died here.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Really?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Yeah. &#xA0;She said it is the reason why this flame never goes out.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Wow.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">It was the first time they heard this story, so the children&apos;s eyes shone brightly. &#xA0;The Fire Spirit King from earth had performed a lot of weird shows at the square, so he was very popular amongst the children.</span></p><p><span style="">A flame remained where he had died....</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;So that&apos;s why our meat is cooking so deliciously!&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Let&apos;s cook here again tomorrow.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Yeah. &#xA0;Let&apos;s do that.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">The children were in a world where deaths and goodbyes were too familiar. &#xA0;The innocent children made a promise as they swore to meet again tomorrow as they locked their dirty pinkies.</span></p><p><span style="">Hwah-roo-roohk.</span></p><p><span style="">The flame continued to get smaller and larger. &#xA0;It was breathing.</span></p>
