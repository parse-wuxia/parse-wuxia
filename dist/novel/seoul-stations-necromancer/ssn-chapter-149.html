<p><span style="">Chapter 149 - Planet Jaku</span></p><p><span style="">Nigal&apos;s body turned gray as it disappeared. &#xA0;Several Dimensional lords had followed Nigal with their monster subordinates.</span></p><p><span style="">Kee-kee-keek.</span></p><p><span style="">In a flash, there were only laughters of the Skeletons left on the battlefield.</span></p><p><span style="">The party gulped in bewilderment when they saw a slaughter happen in a blink of an eye.</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin approached them as he spoke.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;We&apos;ll separate into three groups as planned. &#xA0;If something happens, contact me.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes, hyung-nim..&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Understood.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Sunggoo wouldn&apos;t be a problem. He would be moving separately from Woojin, but Sunggoo&apos;s goal was to train instead of hunt. &#xA0;Moreover, Woojin wouldn&apos;t be too far from him.</span></p><p><span style="">He turned his head to look at Jaemin.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I&apos;ll see you in 4 days. Work hard until then.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes, hyung.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Jaemin had a determined expression on his face. &#xA0;He was overwhelmed by the burden placed on him, but in the end, he had to succeed. &#xA0;Jaemin was victorious in his Dimensional Battle, and he had earned a protection period of 4 days. Woojin used that time as a deadline as to when the party would meet up.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I&apos;ll see you later.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Mmmm. Where should I start my hunt...&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Woojin pointed at Necia&apos;s Pillar.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;You can go raid Dungeons. &#xA0;When you clear a Dungeon, it&apos;ll break the link.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Woojin planned on breaking all the links to the Dungeons possessed by Dimensional lords on Planet Jaku. &#xA0;While doing this, his main goal was to gain EXP.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;This looks endless.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Baek-jungdo smacked his lips as he looked at the vast grasslands.</span></p><p><span style="">When one passed through a portal, one couldn&apos;t bring any modern technology. He didn&apos;t have a navigation system or a map. They had to fight enemies in a place where the placement of the stars were different, and the length of a day differed from earth.</span></p><p><span style="">No, the problem was the fact that they had to find where the enemies were located at.</span></p><p><span style="">Haesol clasped a small bird to herself.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;This guy will show us the way.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ho-oh?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Haesol&apos;s ability was Taming. Moreover, she had focused on developing her telepathic ability.</span></p><p><span style="">She was someone who had no trouble talking telepathically to 5 people at the same time. &#xA0;It was an ability that went well with her base ability of Taming where she was able to communicate in some form with her animals. These were synergistic abilities. &#xA0;Haesol could feel to a degree what the small bird had seen and felt in this world. &#xA0;It wouldn&apos;t be too hard for her to discern the locations of the other Dungeons.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Stay strong, president.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;We&apos;ll see you in 4 days.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;All right. Don&apos;t you all die on me.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">When the party left, the only ones left was Sunggoo and the Undead Army.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;We should go too.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What? I&apos;m going to go with you?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;If I find a Dungeon, I&apos;ll clear it. &#xA0;You can train outside.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ah. &#xA0;Yes, hyung-nim.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Woojin spoke an order towards the Undead army.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Find the life energies!&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">[As the King commands!] </span></p><p><span style="">At the command of the Death Knights, the Skeletons marched forward. &#xA0;Aside from finding and killing the monsters populating the planet, he had to find the monsters inside the Dungeons too.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Find me a Dungeon, Ggaebi.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">[Koo-kooh. &#xA0;You&apos;ve changed.] </span></p><p><span style="">On Alphen, he had been passive as he protected only his land. &#xA0;Now the Immortal was actively moving to find his enemies.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Stop talking nonsense, and find me one.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">[I&apos;ll do as master wishes. Koo-koohk.] </span></p><p><span style="">Ggaebi exited from Woojin&apos;s shadow, and it started to search the surrounding. Woojin summoned and mounted Shing Sing. &#xA0;Sunggoo was about to jump on when Woojin blocked him.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What are you doing?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What? Aren&apos;t you going to give me a ride?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Every breathing moment you have will be a training opportunity.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;You should try to survive to the best of your ability. &#xA0;I&apos;m not going to interfere with anything he does.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;&#x2026;?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Woojin urged Shing Shing to move as he left behind a confused Sunggoo. &#xA0;There was a city being built not too far away. &#xA0;Woojin headed towards this city with his Undead army.</span></p><p><span style="">After being left by himself, a black smoke coalesced as a Lich appeared.</span></p><p><span style="">[Who is the insolent bastard, who requested to be taught by me!] </span></p><p><span style="">Its flickering red eyes was filled with madness.</span></p><p><span style="">Sunggoo had a sullen expression on his face.</span></p><p><span style=""> It already knew the answer, so why is it asking him the question? </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;it is I.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">[Goo-ha-ha. &#xA0;Shall I test if you are qualified?]</span></p><p><span style="">Fire burst out from the Lich&apos;s staff.</span></p><p><span style="">Kwah-kwahng, kwahng! </span></p><p><span style="">Sunggoo quickly moved to dodge the attack as consecutive explosions went off.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ooh-oohk. &#xA0;You are crazy!&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">He attacked without reason! Moreover, it was a level of magic where a human body wouldn&apos;t survive a direct hit. If this wasn&apos;t some trick, it was really trying to kill him.</span></p><p><span style="">[Goo-hah. &#xA0;Are you giving me a compliment?] </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;&#x2026;.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">The Lich pushed his head through the smoke created by the explosions as it spoke. &#xA0;Sunggoo had an appalled expression on his face. &#xA0;Afterwards, Sunggoo didn&apos;t have much time to gather his thoughts.</span></p><p><span style="">Hwah-roo-roo-roohk, kwahhhng! </span></p><p><span style="">Jaenis didn&apos;t give Sunggoo the time to think.</span></p><p><span style="">*** </span></p><p><span style="">For a brief moment, Woojin was lost in old memories as he heard the sounds of explosions coming from the rear.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hue hue.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">He had survived, and he had become stronger. &#xA0;Sunggoo would do the same.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Anyways, isn&#x2019;t this a colony?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Woojin narrowed his eyes as he looked at the city that was still in construction. There was a artificial colony built at the center of the city. With the colony at its center, the city was within a fixed radius where the Dimensional lord&apos;s power could reach.</span></p><p><span style="">This was like setting up a Dimensional Domain on a planet.</span></p><p><span style="">As the words implied, this was a Colony City.</span></p><p><span style="">One could use the Dimensional Store to buy buildings or dispatch additional troops after being purchased. &#xA0;One could also populate the city with Domain residents.</span></p><p><span style="">One could see a castle built atop a hill.</span></p><p><span style="">The entire city looked as if the boulders and steels had harmonized with each other. &#xA0;It looked like a mechanical fortress.</span></p><p><span style="">As the Skeletons advanced , large boulders came flying from the castle.</span></p><p><span style="">Kwah-kwahng, kwahng! </span></p><p><span style="">Boulders weren&apos;t the only thing that was sent their way. A cannonball with spikes exploded when it embedded itself on the ground. Fragments were sent flying everywhere. The attack was strong enough to take down Skeletons with a single blow.</span></p><p><span style="">Countless siege weapons were being sent their way, and if Woojin reacted slowly, the loss would be heavy.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Dolsae.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Weeeeeeng. </span></p><p><span style="">As if the summoned Dolsae knew what Woojin wanted, it gathered the fallen boulders and steel shrapnels to form its enormous body.</span></p><p><span style="">[Goo-ohhhhhhhhh!] </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Open up a path.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">At Woojin&apos;s order, the enormous Golem started running.</span></p><p><span style="">Koong, koong! </span></p><p><span style="">Each step shook the ground as the sound of the impact rang out. &#xA0;At its charge, the boulders being sent from the castle started to aim for Dolsae.</span></p><p><span style="">Their aim was quite accurate.</span></p><p><span style="">Kwahhng! </span></p><p><span style="">The boulder crushed Dolsae&apos;s head before it embedded itself into the ground. &#xA0;However, Dolsae was still charging forward.</span></p><p><span style="">Goo-goo-goo-goohng. </span></p><p><span style="">The boulder embedded in the ground started shaking as if a force was pulling on it. It was pulled and integrated into Dolsae&apos;s body. &#xA0;The broken head was replaced. &#xA0;Moreover, its arms got longer and its chest got thicker.</span></p><p><span style="">A bigger Titan of Destruction charged forward.</span></p><p><span style="">[Goo-oh-oh!] </span></p><p><span style="">A large chunk of magical energy exited Woojin every time Dolsae increased its body size. &#xA0;However, he didn&apos;t care. &#xA0;He could drink potions, and he could recover his magical energy by using Soul Extraction.</span></p><p><span style="">Kwahhhng! </span></p><p><span style="">In a flash, Dolsae&apos;s large body impacted against the castle wall.</span></p><p><span style="">The castle wall fell, and a gap was formed. &#xA0;Dolsae absorbed the metal and rock from the fallen wall, and Dolsae grew even more. &#xA0;Then it started to go on a rampage.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Charge and sweep them away!&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">[Charge!] </span></p><p><span style="">[Koo-haha. Increase your speed!] </span></p><p><span style="">The Death Knights summoned their Phantom Steeds, and they charged forward.</span></p><p><span style="">Bibi was summoned, and she slowly flew above Woojin&#x2019;s head.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;How about we make our own Colony City here?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Why would I want to do that?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Mmm. &#xA0;Mhmmm. It&apos;ll be good to have one here.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Woojin smirked. </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I bet you want to decorate another castle.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Heh heh heh.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Bibi let out a sly laugh as if Woojin had hit the mark. &#xA0;There wasn&#x2019;t a place untouched by Bibi in regards to the Dimensional Domain of Alandal. &#xA0;&#xA0;The Points given to her as allowance had been used to decorate the castle.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Isn&apos;t the castle at Alandal big enough?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Pi. It is too small.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;&#x2026;.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">How big of a castle did she want? &#xA0;Woojin pointed at the enormous castle in front of him.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;This castle....&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;It is more fun to destroy it than to decorate it.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;cheee.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">At Woojin&apos;s words, Bibi turned her back on him. &#xA0;She played coy as she looked at the castle. </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Heh heh. I guess you are right on that point.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Go level up.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes. Heh heh.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">The Illusion Witch turned into smoke as she disappeared.</span></p><p><span style="">In the end, the Necromancer Immortal&apos;s strong power was directly related to his army. &#xA0;Since he had a lot of familiars under him, he had to manage their levels. &#xA0;War was the best stage for them, and there were a lot of opponents for them to fight on Planet Jaku.</span></p><p><span style="">Even as his Familiars leveled up, a portion of their EXP was sent to Woojin. He didn&apos;t even have to lift a finger, and his EXP would rise. &#xA0;However, it was a much smaller amount of EXP compared to what he could earn if he moved himself.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Shall I start moving?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Woojin was mounted on Shing shing as it ran forward. &#xA0;An announcement popped up when he approached the castle wall.</span></p><p><span style="">&lt;You&apos;ve entered Liah&apos;s Colony called &apos;Combat Fortress&apos;.&gt; </span></p><p><span style="">&lt;She is lost in the nothingness of death. It is impossible to choose Dimensional Battle and Duel.&gt; </span></p><p><span style="">&lt;If successfully cleared, it is possible to choose &apos;Demolish&apos;.&gt; </span></p><p><span style="">Woojin let out a dumbfounded laugh when he read the message.</span></p><p><span style="">The city looked like it was from a mechanical civilization, and the city looked somewhat familiar. &#xA0;This was Liah&#x2019;s Colony. &#xA0;She was the Dimensional lord, who had requested a Duel with him, and he had gained much benefit from defeating her.</span></p><p><span style="">At the same time, he realized why a Dimensional lord&apos;s death was a terrible thing.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;She&apos;ll be robbed blind, while she is dead.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">There was the pitfall to the 12 days of Protection Period.</span></p><p><span style="">It only exempted one from the Dimensional Battle and Duel.</span></p><p><span style="">However, it didn&#x2019;t stop the Adventurers or Challengers from trying to clear the Dungeon or the Colony. &#xA0;The Dimensional lord couldn&#x2019;t respond to the attack, and it was a fatal flaw.</span></p><p><span style="">If one didn&#x2019;t have a wonderful warrior like Kiba designated as captain of defense, one will have no choice, but to be robbed.</span></p><p><span style="">Moreover, if one cleared the Dungeon, it meant the link to this planet would be severed.</span></p><p><span style="">It basically amounted to one losing a single Dimensional Fragment. </span></p><p><span style="">This was also true for the Colony, since it was a gate set up at a location other than a Dungeon.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;So that means I can destroy this?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">There was a smile draped all over Woojin&apos;s face. How great would it be if he could destroy the Dungeons? If he could destroy all the Dugeons on earth, he&apos;ll be able to sever all the links possessed by the Dimensional lords.</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin took out his Warrior&apos;s Weapon as he charged.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Koo-ahh-ahhk! Block them.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Dirty Undead bastards!&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Hostile residents of Lia&apos;s domain were defending the castle. &#xA0;They were all humans.</span></p><p><span style="">Tee-tee-teeng! </span></p><p><span style="">Numerous humans were dispatched in various buildings. &#xA0;They shot guns that were primitive and crude compared to the ones on earth. &#xA0;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">Bullets were shot at Woojin, but the Spirit Armor prevented the bullets from reaching their target.</span></p><p><span style="">These weren&apos;t humans from earth. &#xA0;Woojin had no reason to hesitate in killing them.</span></p><p><span style="">Swahhhk! </span></p><p><span style="">Woojin&apos;s Bone Spears shot forward, and the Bone Spears pierced through the humans.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Monster.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Maybe he should change the definition of what a monster is.</span></p><p><span style="">Maybe he should define it as invaders.</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin could feel the enmity of his enemies. &#xA0;He had already killed a lot of them, and he could see their souls cry out. &#xA0;It had been a while since he had been in the midst of a living hell.</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin&apos;s body shuddered.</span></p><p><span style="">In the past, he had wished fervently to be able to escape places like this. &#xA0;However, the perfume of the living hell reached him. &#xA0;He couldn&#x2019;t explain why he felt so excited.</span></p><p><span style="">He couldn&#x2019;t deny this fact.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hoo-ooh. &#xA0;I can&apos;t help it.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Maybe he was conditioned to be like this or maybe it was his instinct making him act like this. &#xA0;There was no way to know.</span></p><p><span style="">Maybe he really was the monster.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Destroy them all.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Magical energy extended out from Woojin&apos;s body, and it latched onto the bodies scattered around the city.</span></p><p><span style="">Ggwahhhhhhng! </span></p><p><span style="">The corpses exploded all at the same time, and a portion of the city collapsed.</span></p><p><span style="">Kee-kee-kee-keeek. </span></p><p><span style="">The Skeletons buried within the fallen buildings pushed their way out of the rubble, and they headed towards the intact portions of the city.</span></p><p><span style="">Soo-soo-soo-soohk! </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hoo-ooooooooooh.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Woojin took a deep breath, and the souls that were saturating the surrounding was absorbed into him.</span></p><p><span style="">The magical energy that had bottomed out &#xA0;surged upwards.</span></p><p><span style="">The defeaning Festival of Blood &#xA0;was the beginning to razing Planet Jaku to the ground.</span></p><p><span style="">*** </span></p><p><span style="">There was a barren mountain not too far away from Liah&#x2019;s Combat Fortress.</span></p><p><span style="">The sorceress Raksha of the Ratick tribe was assimilated into the surrounding.</span></p><p><span style="">Her blue colored eyes were mournful as she looked at the fierce battlefield&#x2026; &#xA0;No, it was more apt to call it a slaughter field. &#xA0;She was observing what was happening, so she could remember it vividly.</span></p><p><span style=""> Her gaze was on a knight wearing black armor. &#xA0;He was busy swing a weapon that was curved like a crescent moon.</span></p><p><span style="">She couldn&#x2019;t feel the energy of life from him. &#xA0;His courage and &#xA0;savagery couldn&#x2019;t be compared to before.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Relick&#x2026;.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">The great warrior of the Ratick race had become the tool of the enemy.</span></p><p><span style="">The sorceress Raksha of the Ratick tribe took in the battlefield at a glance.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;A predator that eats other predators&#x2026;.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Maybe, her god&#x2019;s prophecy might really be coming true.</span></p>
