Thank you and enjoy.)</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin brought a boulder that weighed about the same as him.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Try throwing it.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Gwuhhhh.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Dolsae used all his might, but it fell way short of reaching the land across the divide. It was possible to throw 200m across, but it required much more strength to throw something 300m high.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Wait a second.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin add 9 Skill Points to the Golem Summon Skill. He upped it to 10.</span></p><p><span style="">Meditation is used to summon the Golem&#x2019;s heart, which creates the body.</span></p><p><span style="">Depending on the Summoner&#x2019;s Loyalty and Trust, the Required Control is decreased. The summoned being needing control by the Summoner may be reformed into a true companion.</span></p><p><span style="">Possible Medium: Dirt, Boulder, ? (lv 20 Cancel)</span></p><p><span style="">Magic Consumption : 30, Needed Control 0(-99 Loyalty, -99 Trust)</span></p><p><span style="">Pah-pahpaht.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Goo-uhhhh.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The light swept over Dolsae several times, and his body started to grow rapidly. His height almost reached 8 meters. Woojin grabbed his neck as he tried to look up at Dolsae.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hey, Dolsae. Let&#x2019;s go eat some boulders.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Goo-uhhhh.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The dirt making up Dolsae&#x2019;s body fell away. It was like 10 dump trucks pouring dirt at the same time. Woojin jumped away with Bibi in hand as they avoided the dirt.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Uh-ooh. He should have gone to the side and done it.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Weeeng, weeeng.</span></p><p><span style="">At Woojin&#x2019;s criticism, Dolsae&#x2019;s true body, or the Golem&#x2019;s nucleus trembled. Bibi touched Dolsae in a sweet manner.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Are you sad like a stone? Dolsae-jjing. I&#x2019;ll send master to dreamland at once. Ooh-jju-jju.(TLN: exaggerated/comical kissing sound)&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Weeeng, weeeng.</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin frowned as he looked at the rapidly rotating light.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What the hell are you guys doing?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Heh heh. The earthlings played like this for fun.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin made a note in his head to see what Martian Virus was all about. As he was thinking this, he pointed toward a boulder located off to one side.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Dolae. Cut it out, and go eat a boulder.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Weeeeeng.</span></p><p><span style="">The golem&#x2019;s nucleus absorbed the boulder. The boulder shifted and it started to slowly disintegrate. Then it reformed as it rose from the ground. It&#x2019;s height was smaller. It was about 4 meters tall, and its strength couldn&#x2019;t even be compare to the clay golem.</span></p><p><span style="">Hwee-ooooohng.</span></p><p><span style="">Dolsae threw another boulder. It reach the opposite side, but it fell way short of reaching the top of the cliff.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;This won&#x2019;t do.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">If he put the rest of his Skill Points into the Golem Summon, will Dolsae have enough power to reach the top? Dolsae&#x2019;s level would naturally rise as they fight alongside each other. It felt like a waste to use all the Skill Points based on a rash decision.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I have to level up anyways.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">If he reached level 40 then he&#x2019;ll have a way to cross the divide. The forest was large and there were a lot of monsters in it. The only thing worrying him was the Dungeon Break, so he tried to calculate when it&#x2019;ll happen.</span></p><p><span style="">The Return Stone needed to be found in 30 days real time. The amount of time passed in here would be 120 days before the monsters start popping out. One had to secure the Return Stone before that time.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;When did I come in here?.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">It was past 7 pm, but it hadn&#x2019;t been 8 pm yet. The Dungeon Break will happen the next day at 2:11 PM. So he had around 18 hours? 19 hours?</span></p><p><span style="">He didn&#x2019;t know the exact time.</span></p><p><span style="">It was 4 times slower in here, so he should have around 3 days and 4 hours.</span></p><p><span style="">The margin of error was large.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I&#x2019;ll assume it&#x2019;s 3 days.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">That was the amount of time he had to obtain the Return Stone. He couldn&#x2019;t use 3 days to just jump over a canyon.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;The key is to reach level 40.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">He had to reach it in a day. Woojin looked at the forest. Dolsae could use boulders as medium to form his body now, so it should be pretty easy to deal with the ogres now.</span></p><p><span style="">He had to get to level 40 as fast as he could.</span></p><p><span style="">He&#x2019;ll use his new familiar to get over this canyon. The obtaining of the Return Stone was his top priority, since he had to block the Dungeon Break.</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin had a purpose and a goal now, so he started to move.</span></p><p><span style="">*</span></p><p><span style="">Jookjung Station&#x2019;s Dungeon Break 1st Line of Defense 3rd Check Point.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Uh? Sergeant Kim.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;The p&#x2026;portal disappeared.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What bullshit are you spouting?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Sergeant Kim had been lying on his side. He raised his body then he looked toward the Jookjung Station&#x2019;s 3rd Exit. The portal that had been formed in front of the stairway had disappeared.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;W&#x2026;when did it disappear??&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;It just disappeared. A man went in first then a woman also went in. Then the portal&#x2026;&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;F&#x2026;fuck. You keep watching it.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes, sir.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Sergeant Kim quickly called the signal corpsman over. His report was quickly relayed, and it reached the 50th divisional commander&#x2019;s ears soon.</span></p><p><span style="">The aide visited the hotel room where the divisional commander was staying</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Who entered?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;It was Roused Mr. Kang-woojin and Ms. Lee-yunhwee.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Divisional commander Lee-joontae frowned. The two of them had been impudent from the first time he had met them, and both of them had entered the portal side by side.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Is it the young trying to play hero?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Lee-joontae looked at his aide.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What about the media?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;They don&#x2019;t know yet. There are only soldiers near the area of operation. However, they will find out soon.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The portal emitted light. Even from afar, one could see it through telescopic lens. If they notice the oddity and ask questions, then he couldn&#x2019;t hide the incident.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ughhh.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Lee-joontae was worried. How would this incident affect him? He thought about the various possibilities, and he concluded that the damage he will receive was minimal.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What if they clear the Dungeon?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I have a hard time seeing it&#x2026;.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I guess we have to consider them to be dead.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Then the Dungeon Break will happen on schedule. Nothing will change. So the only thing different is losing Hwarang guild president&#x2019;s dongsaeng, Lee-yunhwee?</span></p><p><span style="">Kang-woojin was the guild master of Alandal guild. It was formed only couple days ago, so his disappearance didn&#x2019;t bother Lee-joontae.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I guess nothing has changed. I want you to crackdown on the troops, then get ready for the Break tomorrow.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes, sir. Understood.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">When the aide left, Lee-joontae took out his hand phone to make a call. Just because he wasn&#x2019;t affected by this, it didn&#x2019;t mean the others would be in the same boat as him.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;It&#x2019;s me.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">[Yes. Why is the divisional commander calling me in the night&#x2026;?]</span></p><p><span style="">Impudent bastard. This bastard was always short on words.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Lee-hyunhwee just entered the portal. I&#x2019;m pretty sure that wasn&#x2019;t part of the plan?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">[&#x2026;&#x2026;.]</span></p><p><span style="">He knew the other&#x2019;s silence was accompanied by a large amount of confusion. Lee-joontae secretly smiled.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;The reporters will start making a hubbub. What should we do?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">[I&#x2019;ll call you again after I assess the situation.]</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Understood.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">[Please suppress the media reports. I&#x2019;ll be heading to Daegoo immediately..]</span></p><p><span style="">Lee-joontae laughed after he ended the call. This bastard was arrogant, because he rose to the seat of president at a young age. Lee-joontae was amused by the current situation.</span></p><p><span style="">The guy manipulated the events, and now his dongsaeng&#x2019;s blood was about to be used as a scapegoat.</span></p><p><span style="">*</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ready my helicopter.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes, sir.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Lee-sahngho&#x2019;s cold face was rigid. He picked up his hand phone, then he called the Lee-yunhwee&#x2019;s vice team leader.</span></p><p><span style="">[Yes, president.]</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;You maggots. Where is your team leader?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">[What? Team leader tailed after Mr. Kang-woojin.]</span></p><p><span style="">A vein popped out on Lee-sahngho&#x2019;s forehead.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;You son of a bitch! I told you to look after her, so that bitch, Yunhwee, won&#x2019;t get into trouble.!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">[What?]</span></p><p><span style="">He didn&#x2019;t know why he was being yelled at, so the vice team leader answered in a dazed voice. This made Lee-sahngho yell louder.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;You son of a bitch. They said Yunhwee went into the portal right now!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">[&#x2026;&#x2026;.]</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I&#x2019;m currently heading there. Before I get there, find out what happened! Go right now!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">[Yes, president.]</span></p><p><span style="">Ddoo-ooh, ddoo.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hoo-ooh, Hooh-ook.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Lee-sahngho took deep breaths to suppress his anger. His face was red, and both his eyes were bloodshot. His anger didn&#x2019;t show any signs of abating.</span></p><p><span style="">At that moment, his hand phone started ringing again. Lee-sahngho frowned when he read the name that popped up on the screen</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Why is this old man so good at hearing thing?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Lee-sahngho pressed the answer button.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes, chairman.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">[President Lee. What&#x2019;s happened?]</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;It isn&#x2019;t a big incident.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">[What do you mean it isn&#x2019;t a big incident? Your dongsaeng went in. Is she perhaps trying to clear the Dungeon? Are you really going to put me in an awkward situation like this?]</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;How can that be? The money I invested isn&#x2019;t small either. Yunhwee acted one her own. It doesn&#x2019;t represent the stance of Hwarang.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">[Koo-hmmm. Let&#x2019;s see what happens tomorrow.]</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;The Dungeon Break will happen on schedule.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">[All right. It is regrettable what happened to your dongsaeng.]</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I&#x2019;m sorry for making you worried.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Ddoo-ooh, dook.</span></p><p><span style="">When the phone call ended, Lee-sahngho&#x2019;s face became red, and it looked as if it would explode.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;You son of a bitch! Regret? Did he say regret?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">His dongsaeng was about to die yet he only felt regret? Lee-sahngho was about to throw his phone when the phone rang again.</span></p><p><span style="">Ddi-ri-ddi-ri-dingdong. Ddi-ri-ddi-ri-dingdong.</span></p><p><span style="">When he saw the number Lee-sahngho laughed loudly.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I guess he is feeling really impatient? He must have planted many eyes in various places. The information traveled on an LTE level.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The official statement to the media wasn&#x2019;t even sent out yet. So how was he able to know and call him so soon? He must have a lot of people in his pocket.</span></p><p><span style="">Of course, these bastards are experts at such dealings.</span></p><p><span style="">Lee-sahngho answered the phone.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes, congressman Park.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">[Are you trying to play with me! Is Hwarang trying to pull some mischief!]</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;We aren&#x2019;t trying to plot any mischief. The Dungeon Break will happen.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">[After the city is fully demolished, we have to redevelop that place! Do you get what I&#x2019;m trying to say? Do you realize how much of my money is invested in this? My money!]</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Absolutely. Please don&#x2019;t worry about it.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Ddoo-ooh, dook.</span></p><p><span style="">After the phone call ended, Lee-sahngho didn&#x2019;t have the strength to be mad.</span></p><p><span style="">He flopped down on to the floor and a dejected laughter leaked out of him.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ha ha&#x2026; Ha&#x2026;.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Lee-yunhwee. Lee-yunhwee.</span></p><p><span style="">He was merely a Rank B, so she was the Roused that had to represent the Hwarang guild instead of him. If she is gone, then the current Hwarang will disappear.</span></p><p><span style="">The guild master Lee-sahngho of the 3 great guilds of Korea won&#x2019;t exist.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;That crazy bitch. She should have appropriately managed her anger. Fuck&#x2026;.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">He had soothed and humored that rude bitch to come this far, yet she inevitably made an accident. Moreover, it was a suicide&#x2026;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Even if you are going to suicide, you shouldn&#x2019;t have done it during this big deal&#x2026;.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Lee-sahngoho&#x2019;s cold face hardened.</span></p><p><span style="">Too too too too too too too.</span></p><p><span style="">From a distance, Lee-sahngho heard the rotor of a helicopter, so he stood up from his seat.</span></p><p><span style="">Lee-sahngho&#x2019;s chest wasn&#x2019;t filled with sadness. It was filled with anger instead.</span></p><p><span style="">The fact that he lost a Rank A Roused affected him more than the fact his dongsaeng had died.</span></p><p><span style="">The wings that would have allowed him to achieve his ambitions was broken.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hoo-ooh.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The relationship between the siblings had festered too much for him to feel sorrow for his dongsaeng.</span></p><p><span style="">*</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ah. I have to pee.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Lee-yunhwee looked between the bones, which was as thick as her arm. She looked around her surrounding, but she couldn&#x2019;t see Woojin anywhere. It had already been awhile, so he must have covered a lot of distance by now.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;That psycho bitch. How can he beat a woman like that? Especially a pretty girl like me?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Yunhwee released her anger towards Woojin, and she broke off one of bone teeth.</span></p><p><span style="">She was a Rank A Physical Ability Roused.</span></p><p><span style="">Ddo-dook.</span></p><p><span style="">She didn&#x2019;t have any problems escaping a Bone Prison of this caliber. Her strength was several times higher than a normal person.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ah-oh. They said that bitch was a magician, so why is he so fast?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">When she thought about Woojin, it automatically brought a surge of nausea.</span></p><p><span style="">When she broke the second tooth, a hole big enough for a flexible woman to escape opened up.</span></p><p><span style="">After she got out, she picked up her fallen sword then she looked around her surrounding. She quickly pulled her pants down to take care of her business.</span></p><p><span style="">Shweeee.</span></p><p><span style="">She looked towards the direction Woojin disappeared to, and she could see several dozen footprints on the ground.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;That gangster bitch. He isn&#x2019;t in the mob yet he goes around with a posse.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">She had an illustrious career, but she had never seen a Necromancer like him. Still, she had never had the chance to clear a Dungoen with other Roused. She had always been together with her teammates.</span></p><p><span style="">When she pulled up her pants, she tilted her head in puzzlement.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Is he really going to clear it himself?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">When she thought of Woojin&#x2019;s overflowing confidence, she was sure he could do it.</span></p><p><span style="">Moreover, when she recalled the glare he gave her at the end, her body automatically shook.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Whew. Fuck.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Her pride had been hurt. The humiliation drove her crazy. She had thought she had moved beyond death. However, the extreme fear she had felt and the desire to live had corrected that notion. She felt an unbearable humiliation at having such thoughts.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hoong. If he wants to kill me then he can try.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Of course, she had no plan on dying.</span></p><p><span style="">It wasn&#x2019;t as if she couldn&#x2019;t clear this Dungeon in the first place. She had chosen not to clear it.</span></p><p><span style="">Her group stayed in the beginning portion of the Dungeon, and they hadn&#x2019;t even attempted the Dungeon. She had no idea if it was possible to clear this Dungeon or not.</span></p><p><span style="">If they seriously tried to clear this Dungeon, they might have still failed. However, Lee-yunhwee was confident she would have been able to.</span></p><p><span style="">If it wasn&#x2019;t for her oppa&#x2019;s order, her Vermillion team would have been able to clear this Dungeon.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I&#x2019;ll be the one getting out of here first.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">She wasn&#x2019;t confident she could face all the monster, but she was confident she could find the Return Stone and run away with it.</span></p><p><span style="">She was a Rank A Swordswoman.</span></p><p><span style="">She was the Shadow Hunter Lee-yunhwee.</span></p><p><span style="">(TLN: Lee-yunhwee and Lee-sahngho are real siblings. Just wanted to clear that up if anyone was confused.)</span></p><p></p></div><p></p>
