<p><span style="">Chapter 133 - Bloody Reunion (3)</span></p><p><span style="">When a Reset Dungeon was linked to earth, a Return Stone was formed. &#xA0;The proper Synchronization process hadn&apos;t happened, so there was a 120 days wait period. &#xA0;However, the soldiers of the Domain was armed to the teeth as if they were immediately going into battle.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yo-ho-ho. &#xA0;Get ready.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">This Dimensional lord was a large spider-human. &#xA0;Her name was Sharot. &#xA0;Lee-sahngho relaxed his nervous body when he heard Sharot&apos;s words.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;I&apos;m returning to earth.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">Lee-sahngho had become dulled through his death and revival. &#xA0;Still, his heart started to beat faster at the tingling sensation when he thought about his home planet.</span></p><p><span style="">After a brief moment, the red portal was formed. &#xA0;An extremely nervous man appeared.</span></p><p><span style="">He became guarded when he saw the monsters. &#xA0;Soon, he came to his senses, and he headed towards the Return Stone as he surveyed his surrounding.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;The Linker is here.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Sharot&apos;s army didn&apos;t attack the human. &#xA0;The human disappeared when he took the Return Stone.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yo-ho-ho. Shall we go fight?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">She was very experienced in colonizing planets. The early sacrifices couldn&apos;t be helped, but the thought about the reward made the loss acceptable. &#xA0;The human from earth, who was the Linker, would open the barrier on his own volition. </span></p><p><span style="">The unfortunate part was that they hadn&apos;t completed their synchronization.</span></p><p><span style="">&lt;You are entering the Planet Earth. Seventy four percent of your ability will be materialized.&gt; </span></p><p><span style="">This was the drawback of forcing a Dungeon Link. The Dimensional lord and the monsters under him received penalty depending on the Synchronization rate.</span></p><p><span style="">Basically, they didn&apos;t have to successfully fend off intruders 120 days.</span></p><p><span style="">With the help of the Linker, the Dungeon Barrier subduing them was dispelled. &#xA0;The monsters poured out into the streets. &#xA0;Lee-sahngho exited with the monsters, and he hid himself between the escaping people.</span></p><p><span style="">*** </span></p><p><span style="">MBS Broadcast Studio.</span></p><p><span style="">Do-jaemin acquired this ticket by making a request to the guild. &#xA0;He sat in the appropriate seat with the ticket in his grasp.</span></p><p><span style="">His noonah went to her reunion. &#xA0;Woojin, Sunggoo and anyone he was close to all went out to clear Dungeons.</span></p><p><span style="">He had a day before he had to return for the Dimensional Battle. &#xA0;However, he hadn&apos;t come here to kill time.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I can&apos;t believe Soolgi already made her debut.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">There was someone he wanted to see.</span></p><p><span style="">She was his first love, and she was someone he couldn&apos;t catch. &#xA0;She had fulfilled her dream a week ago.</span></p><p><span style="">He had debuted on an idol group call &apos;Hot Girls&apos;. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">They were a new girl group, and today was the day the &apos;Hot Girls&apos; would be recorded on a music program.</span></p><p><span style="">He wanted to see Soolgi from afar, so he had come here.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;O...oppa. &#xA0;Are you here to cheer for Lexor?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Huh?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">A girl in the next seat mustered her courage as she asked Jaemin a question. &#xA0;Jaemin looked at her with a confused expression on his face.</span></p><p><span style="">A handsome teen with pale skin was staring at her. &#xA0;Her cheeks reddened, and she turned away. &#xA0;She couldn&apos;t bring herself to look into his eyes.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;T...this is the cheering section for the Lexor oppas...&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;&#x2026;.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Jaemin looked around his surrounding. &#xA0;Now that he paid attention to it all, the people here were holding the same colored balloons.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;No. &#xA0;I&apos;m a Hot Girls fan.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hot Girls? Who&apos;s that.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">They debuted only a week ago, so it seemed they weren&apos;t famous. No one was talking about their popularity. &#xA0;It was as if the public wasn&apos;t even aware of them yet.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;When the Hot Girls come out, you guys should make some noise for them.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ah. &#xA0;All right.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">These girls risked coming to the recording studio of the dangerous Seoul to cheer for their oppas, yet the girls immediately agreed to the handsome Jaemin&apos;s request. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">His handsomeness had the power gathering the girls around him.</span></p><p><span style="">Jaemin was breathing rapidly as the girls formed a crowd with him at the center.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;I can&apos;t stand it anymore.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">If he stayed here any longer, he would bite someone&apos;s throat.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;S...so you guys have to cheer for the Hot Girls. &#xA0;All right?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes. &#xA0;Understood, oppa.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;All right.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Jaemin quickly got up from his seat, and he disappeared. &#xA0;The girls started to talk amongst themselves.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Kyahhhk! Did you take a picture of him?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Wow. &#xA0;He was uber handsome. &#xA0;Jackpot!&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Is he a trainee? &#xA0;Is he part of the Hot Girls? &#xA0;Maybe he is a trainee under the same company?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Maybe he came to cheer for the same entertainment family.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">When he had turned into a vampire, Jaemin had become paler and prettier. &#xA0;All the girls thought he was prospective entertainer. </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ooh-wah. &#xA0;If that oppa debuts, I&apos;m jumping ship.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I shook his hand a moment ago. &#xA0;Ha-ah. &#xA0;I think I can still smell his scent.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Jaemin extracted himself from the group of noisy girls, and he found a spot in the back to watch the stage.</span></p><p><span style="">The stage was too far to make out people&apos;s faces, but Jaemin didn&apos;t need a binocular.</span></p><p><span style="">His physical ability had already surpassed that of a normal human.</span></p><p><span style="">After several unknown groups finished their rehearsals, the Hot Girls ascended to the stage. &#xA0;There were three members to the group, but Jaemin didn&apos;t see anyone else. &#xA0;His eyes was only filled with the sight of Soolgi.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Look how thin she is.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">She had always been slim, yet it seemed she had gone on a diet. &#xA0;He felt sorry about it. Aside from his worry for her, Soolgi looked beautiful as she sang and danced in her stage costume.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ha&#x2026; Soolgi.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">What would have happened if he held on to her? &#xA0;Will he be dating her? </span></p><p><span style="">No, she had a dream, and he might have unnecessarily dragged her down.</span></p><p><span style="">Yes. This was how it should be.</span></p><p><span style="">&apos;I&apos;m a monster now, Soolgi. &#xA0;I&apos;ll cheer for you from afar.&apos;</span></p><p><span style="">Jaemin looked on with sentimental eyes, and he saw the Hot Girls leave the stage after their performance.</span></p><p><span style="">He had seen Soolgi, and he didn&apos;t want to watch the other singers take stage. He exited the station. &#xA0;No, he tried to leave.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;W...what the hell?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Koooo-ohhhhhh! </span></p><p><span style="">The roads were teeming with Monsters. </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Is it a Dungeon Break?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Woojin had spent a good amount of time inside Woojin&apos;s Dimensional Domain of Alandal. &#xA0;He wasn&apos;t surprised by the appearance of monsters, but he would have a hard time fighting them. &#xA0;Jaemin&apos;s combat ability wasn&apos;t that exceptional.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I have to run away quickly.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Ggiii-ohhhhhh! </span></p><p><span style="">He turned his head to looked at the source of the roar. &#xA0;He saw monsters flying over the broadcasting station&apos;s roof. &#xA0;Moreover, several of them dived in through the windows.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;S...Soolgi!&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Jaemin was worried about Soolgi, so he once again ran back into the broadcasting station.</span></p><p><span style="">*** </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hey. &#xA0;Look who it is!&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ha ha. &#xA0;It&apos;s good to see you. &#xA0;How long has it been?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">It was the start of the reunion party. &#xA0;To some people, this was a walk down memory lane. &#xA0;To others, this was an event to network with the alumnis. </span></p><p><span style="">They had spent a good amount of money to rent the hotel&apos;s entire reception hall, and there were about 200 people in attendance. &#xA0;It was an enormous reunion party where 90% of the graduates were in attendance.</span></p><p><span style="">They were all busy in real life, since they were newcomers to society. Still, they had shown up, because they wanted to see the famous Kahng-woojin.</span></p><p><span style="">Even as people greeted each other with a cheerful expression, they kept looking around for Kahng-woojin.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hey, Jiwon. &#xA0;Woojin couldn&apos;t make it here today?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes. I&apos;m afraid not.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Jiwon answered chairman Nahm-jihyuhk&apos;s question. At that moment, Cindy came over to ask her question. &#xA0;She still had her sunglasses on. </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Why couldn&apos;t he be here?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;He&apos;s busy.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hmmm. &#xA0;Is that so?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Kahng-woojin hadn&apos;t attended this event, so was there a need for her to stay here? &#xA0;Cindy was about to walk out.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;I unnecessarily changed my schedule to come here.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">She had intentionally left her schedule blank, so she could attend the reunion party. Currently, her popularity was on a full upswing, so every minute and second was money for her.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hey, Cindy. Weren&apos;t you pretty insistent on making an appearance this time? &#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Well, I haven&apos;t been to one of these meetings in a while.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Cindy fixed her sunglasses with her hand as she listened to chairman Nahm-jihyuhk&apos;s flattery.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;It&apos;s been nice seeing you.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Uh uh? You are already leaving?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;My schedule is packed.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Uh. &#xA0;All right. That&apos;s too bad.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Nahm-jihyuhk&apos;s inner heart trembled as he tried hard to hide his emotions.</span></p><p><span style="">He was a twenty four year old young man.</span></p><p><span style="">They were classmates once, but he had only see her through the television for the past 5 years. &#xA0;He couldn&apos;t help but be fascinated and terrified at facing a celebrity.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Have fun.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Uh. &#xA0;I&apos;ll see you out.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;All right.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Cindy didn&apos;t turn down the offer as she left the reception hall. Nahm-jihyuhn followed behind her to escort her out. &#xA0;Do-jiwon was left alone by herself, and she felt something was lacking.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;It would have been great if Woojin had come.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Jiwon knew how hard a life Woojin had lived through.</span></p><p><span style="">She wanted him to spark his old memories by meeting his friends from the time he attended school. &#xA0;Would he feel great delight if he could revive a little bit of his old memories? &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">He was busily clearing a Dungeon at that moment. &#xA0;She felt thankful and sorry.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Uh?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Jiwon&apos;s eyes turned round when she looked at the entrance.</span></p><p><span style="">A pale and frightened Cindy was running towards her with Jihyuhk. &#xA0;It was as if they were being chased by something. &#xA0;Soon a cluster of Spiders appeared, and Jiwon let out a scream. </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Kyahhhhk!&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">There were several hundred spiders crawling in, and the sight was quite unpleasant. &#xA0;They were the size of a human&apos;s head.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yo-ho-ho. There are a lot of humans gathered here.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">The spider-woman, Sharot, appeared as she hummed a tune.</span></p><p><span style="">She smiled when she saw the frightened antics of the humans.</span></p><p><span style="">*** </span></p><p><span style="">Doo-roo-roo-rook.</span></p><p><span style="">The vehicles slid on its track as the tanks raced across the road.</span></p><p><span style="">Kieeeeeehk! </span></p><p><span style="">Bat-like monsters were occupying the sky as they let out a frightening sound. &#xA0;The helicopters were useless against them.</span></p><p><span style="">They were able to freely maneuver between buildings as they concealed themselves. &#xA0;It was very hard to decrease their numbers as the ground troops used anti-aircraft weapons.</span></p><p><span style="">The problem was that the bat-like monsters weren&apos;t the only monsters present.</span></p><p><span style="">Goo-ohhhhhh! </span></p><p><span style="">Accompanying the roar, a large bear monster charged towards a tank. &#xA0;The tanks fired its main gun.</span></p><p><span style="">Kwah-kwah-kwahng! </span></p><p><span style="">In the aftermath of the missed rounds, the explosion caused the road to be overturned and a building&apos;s wall to collapse.</span></p><p><span style="">The large bear emerged from the plume of dust. &#xA0;It&apos;s shoulder and arm had been blown off. &#xA0;It was in a ghastly state, but it was still alive.</span></p><p><span style="">Goo-uh-uhk! </span></p><p><span style="">Kwah-jeek! </span></p><p><span style="">The bear, which was the size of a 2 story building, swung its paw, and it made the main gun bend as easily as a toothpick. &#xA0;The bear swung its paw again, and the tank was flipped over. &#xA0;The tank&apos;s track continued to spin with no traction.</span></p><p><span style="">Kwah-kwah-kwahng. </span></p><p><span style="">The second concentrated fire caused the bear&apos;s head to explode, and it fell to the floor. &#xA0;They were barely able to kill it. &#xA0;The problem was the fact that there were more than one or two monsters in the surrounding.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Shit! What kind of mess is this?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Captain Hahn-sahngpil, who was in charge of the armored unit, cursed as he expressed his frustration.</span></p><p><span style="">There had been minimal damage from previous Breaks, since they&apos;ve made preparations beforehand.</span></p><p><span style="">If they were given a warning about an imminent Break, they would be able to evacuate the surrounding civilians, then they would just have to lay down a concentrated fire on the monsters.</span></p><p><span style="">However, they hadn&#x2019;t been given a warning, and they hadn&apos;t been able to evacuate the civilians. &#xA0;It was hard to attack properly. This was the biggest reason why the military units stationed at various parts of Seoul was making slow progress in their suppression of the monsters.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Fuck! What the hell are the guilds doing?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">It was impossible to eradicate all the monsters using just the fire support from the military units. &#xA0;There were numerous people waiting for rescue within the buildings. &#xA0;Moreover, the Roused was needed to defeat monsters where the guns and cannons couldn&apos;t reach.</span></p><p><span style="">Then there was the Breaks in Daegoo, Gwahngjoo, Busan, Seoul and other places in Korea... &#xA0;No, the Dungeons of the world was Breaking at the same time, and they were in short supply of troops. </span></p><p><span style="">Any Rank E and below Roused was useless compared to a soldier equipped with a gun. &#xA0;At the very least, one had to be Rank D. &#xA0;However, the number of Dungeons Breaking made this a moot point.</span></p><p><span style="">Since they didn&apos;t have the numeric superiority, one would have to use overwhelming firepower. &#xA0;Of course, this made one think about a certain high rank Roused.</span></p><p><span style="">There were some countries, who were mulling the use of nuclear weapons, so the presence of this man was that much more crucial.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Is he still not here yet?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">The roads and buildings were occupied with monsters.</span></p><p><span style="">The alien nature of this event reminded him of the Dungeon Shock from 5 years ago.</span></p><p><span style="">The world was about to experience that hell once again.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;C...Captain! Look over there.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Huh?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">His aide desperately yelled out. Hahn-sahngpil grabbed the binoculars that had been around his neck. &#xA0;He swallowed his response as he looked towards the pointed direction.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Mmmmm.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">An enormous Dragon was sitting on top of the Namsan Tower as it had its claws dug in. It sat there as if it was looking over Seoul. &#xA0;It was like seeing a scene from a movie.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;T...this is the first time I&apos;ve seen such a big monster.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">It was a first experience for Hahn-sahngpil too. &#xA0;Soon, two fighter jets approached it, and they fired missiles towards the unknown monster atop the Namsan Tower.</span></p><p><span style="">Kwahhhng! </span></p><p><span style="">The explosion was so large that the far away armored unit felt the aftereffects. &#xA0;However, the Dragon wasn&apos;t hurt at all. &#xA0;The monster had engaged a barrier that was as big as its body.</span></p><p><span style="">How great would it have been if this was a movie?</span></p><p><span style="">A monster that might cause a calamity in Seoul had appeared.</span></p>
