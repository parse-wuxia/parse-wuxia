<p>Chapter 199 - Trahnet (4)</p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What is it&#xFF1F;&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I&#x2019;ll try to persuade the Deletion Admin.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;He doesn&#x2019;t have his memory, so what can you do!&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">The risk was too large. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">The man was crazy, and he was too unpredictable.</span></p><p><span style="">Toppler calmly tried to persuade the agitated Speaker Shelt.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;He already has the keys now. &#xA0;We have no choice, but to call him here for a Reset.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;He tries to kill any one of us that he meets, so how will you be able to persuade him! &#xA0;Words don&#x2019;t work on that bastard.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I&#x2019;ll persuade him.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;&#x2026;&#x2026;.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Shelt glared at him, but Toppler didn&#x2019;t blink.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I can persuade him. &#xA0;I have to go to earth.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;&#x2026;&#x2026;.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Do you have any other options?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Eeek&#x2026;.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">He might be right.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I&#x2019;ll have to discuss this with the Council&#x2026;.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Speaker&#xFF01;&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Toppler suddenly yelled out in anger.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Are you trying to kill us all? &#xA0;This isn&#x2019;t the time for us to hesitate. &#xA0;We have to get in front of this as soon as possible!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">They were in uncharted territory.</span></p><p><span style="">Iello had appeared much earlier than the records indicated. &#xA0;Kahng-woojin hadn&#x2019;t finished his key, yet he had encountered Iello. &#xA0;Moreover, he was able to achieve a ridiculous result.</span></p><p><span style="">The cause of this change was numerous, but Dr. Toppler&#x2019;s arbitrary decision to meet him was probably one of the contributing factors.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Since you caused this incident, you are in charge of fixing it&#xFF01;&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;understood.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Open.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">At Speaker&#x2019;s Shelt&#x2019;s command, the two panels to the glass door slid open. &#xA0;Dr. Toppler became a free man.</span></p><p><span style="">He immediately gave a request to the soldier standing ready off to the side.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Please ready my ship.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">He had to get to earth as soon as possible.</span></p><p><span style="">He had to get there before the Dimensional Admin arrived on earth.</span></p><p><span style="">***</span></p><p><span style="">Zzuh-juh-juhng!</span></p><p><span style="">The frozen Hahn river started to melt. &#xA0;The Thorn Tree had grown as if it was defying the heavens, and the ice covering it was melting. &#xA0;Even the ice castle started to melt as it fell to the ground.</span></p><p><span style="">Hwah-roo-roo-roohk!</span></p><p><span style="">The Hell Hydras were crazily pouring out flame, and it was accelerating the process.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hoo-ooh.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin had basically consumed all his magical energy, so he started to gather the souls of the monsters.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ssssp.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">He absorbed all the souls at once, and his magical energy began to recover slowly.</span></p><p><span style="">Iello&#x2019;s body melted, and one couldn&apos;t even see the outline of its form. &#xA0;The only thing left was the damp spot on the ground. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin unnecessarily kicked the ground.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Didn&#x2019;t I tell you I&#x2019;ll kill you?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The activation condition was troublesome, but Thrash&#x2019;s Punishment was powerful. &#xA0;How could an elemental body avoid the God of Destruction&#x2019;s Punishment?</span></p><p><span style="">The monsters and the Dimensional lords, which had filled the surrounding region, were close to being settled.</span></p><p><span style="">He had been able to achieve his Level Up thanks to the extermination of the monsters, which caused a steady increase in his EXP.</span></p><p><span style="">Shwahk.</span></p><p><span style="">A black smoke flew to the side of Woojin. &#xA0;It coalesced to form Jaenis.</span></p><p><span style="">[What happened to the Executioner?]</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I&#x2019;m not sure.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">There was no noticeable change.</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin opened his Status Window, and he carefully looked over it. &#xA0;His level had changed to 99, but the only discernable change was the increase of some Stats.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I guess this has nothing to do with Level. &#xA0;Do I have to gather all of Thrash&#x2019;s Set Item?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">He had hunted an incredible number of monsters, and he had amassed an incredible amount of Achievement Points. &#xA0;He immediately opened his Achievement Store, and he started purchasing all the Ingredients needed to make Thrash&#x2019;s Glory.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I think I&#x2019;ll be able to purchase all of them..&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">If he could do this with only the expenditure of the Achievement Points, he didn&#x2019;t have to work so hard to gather the Dimensional Points.</span></p><p><span style="">Jaemin was still soloing the Dimensional Battles, and his Dimensional Points was still going up&#x2026;..</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Let&#x2019;s see.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin put the purchased Ingredient Items and Aria&#x2019;s Holy Item into the Combination Box.</span></p><p><span style="">When he pressed the Combination button, several dozen ingredients mixed to form a circlet. &#xA0;It looked like a crown with a skull embedded in it.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Thrash&#x2019;s Glory.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin took it out from his Inventory, and he put it on.</span></p><p><span style="">Thrash&#x2019;s Glory, Protection, Punishment, Dignity and March.</span></p><p><span style="">He had gathered all the five defensive gears, so all the Set Effect became active.</span></p><p><span style="">His Control ability increased, and now he would be able to control an army five times larger than his previous Undead army. &#xA0;He would also be able to summon the Death Field, which was the ultimate battlefield for the Undeads.</span></p><p><span style="">Aside from those powers, all the basic abilities he commanded in Alphen was also restored.</span></p><p><span style="">The desperate feeling he had was wiped away, but his expression eventually stiffened.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;It&#x2019;s not working.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">[The Executioner&#x2026;&#x2026;.]</span></p><p><span style="">He had gathered all his Set Items, and he had raised his Dual Class to Level 99. &#xA0;Still, the Thrash&#x2019;s Executioner hadn&#x2019;t appeared.</span></p><p><span style="">[The earth&#x2019;s Master Code&#x2026;.]</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Stop.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">However, he blocked Jaenis from talking any further.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Don&#x2019;t say it.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">[&#x2026;&#x2026;.]</span></p><p><span style="">Jaenis saw Woojin&#x2019;s expressionless face, and it could no longer continue its words. &#xA0;Jaenis could feel Woojin&#x2019;s anger settle.</span></p><p><span style="">Jaenis was Woojin&#x2019;s teacher, and it had witnessed him on the battlefield. &#xA0;If not, Janeis would have needed to see his anger with its own eyes.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Let us slowly look for it..&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">[I bow to the lord&#x2019;s will.]</span></p><p><span style="">Shwahhhk.</span></p><p><span style="">Jaenis&#x2019; body turned into black smoke, and it swirled out of existence.</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin let out a bitter laugh when he saw Seoul, which was razed to the ground.</span></p><p><span style="">This was hell amongst hell for him.</span></p><p><span style="">There were the corpses of beings, who looked similar to humans, mixed in with the monsters. &#xA0;The corpses were everywhere, and there was only one being alive there.</span></p><p><span style="">It was a bad feeling, but it was also a familiar feeling.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Rise.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">At Woojin&#x2019;s command, the corpses exploded as the Skeleton Warriors appeared. &#xA0;He was now able to command more Skeletons than before. &#xA0;He assigned the Skeleton Warriors to the command of the Death Knights, and he replenished his Undead army.</span></p><p><span style="">[My king.]</span></p><p><span style="">Kiba came to his side, and they faced each other.</span></p><p><span style="">Its large tusk and the shaking red flame in its eyes revealed its concern for him.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I&#x2019;ll call you next time.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">[I bow to the lord&#x2019;s will.] </span></p><p><span style="">Shwahk.</span></p><p><span style="">It started with Kiba, then all the other Death Knights turned into smoke as they disappeared.</span></p><p><span style="">Koo-oo-oohng.</span></p><p><span style="">The sound of impact was heard. &#xA0;It was hard to tell if it landed or crashed. &#xA0;He looked at the Blood Dragon.</span></p><p><span style="">[&#x2026;&#x2026;.]</span></p><p><span style="">Unlike its usual self, the Blood Dragon was silent. &#xA0;Woojin unsummoned it.</span></p><p><span style="">Weeeeng.</span></p><p><span style="">Blood started to evaporate, and the blood surrounding the Blood Dragon sloughed off. &#xA0;Dolsae, who was in its Golem&#x2019;s Heart form, revolved around Woojin before it disappeared.</span></p><p><span style="">Even the Bone Dragon dissolved into black smoke, and the only one left by Woojin was Bibi.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Master. &#xA0;I want to go back.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;all right.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin summoned Shing Shing, and they flew towards the Flying Fortress in the sky. &#xA0;The clue to the Executioner&#x2026;.</span></p><p><span style="">He hadn&#x2019;t found it yet.</span></p><p><span style="">No, even if he hadn&#x2019;t acquired the answer, it didn&#x2019;t matter.</span></p><p><span style="">***</span></p><p><span style="">Toppler&#x2019;s ship parted the black atmosphere, and it landed on dead land.</span></p><p><span style="">Pshhhhhh.</span></p><p><span style="">The thruster engine turned off as the ship landed onto earth.</span></p><p><span style="">Pshhhhoong.</span></p><p><span style="">The floor to Toppler&#x2019;s ship opened as a ladder descended.</span></p><p><span style="">Tuhung, tuhng.</span></p><p><span style="">Earth&#x2019;s air was no longer breathable by humans. &#xA0;Dr. Toppler descended the ladder wearing a spacesuit.</span></p><p><span style="">Too-oohk.</span></p><p><span style="">When he stepped onto the surface of earth, the soldiers detached to Leone&#x2019;s ship approached him.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I received the news, Professor.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;We don&#x2019;t have much time, captain Leone.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;We&#x2019;ve secured the tunnel leading to the target.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Captain Leone had taken care of everything, so Dr. Toppler nodded his head.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;The plan is simple. &#xA0;I&#x2019;ll approach him. &#xA0;If I&#x2019;m successful in persuading him, please be ready to rescue him.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Wouldn&#x2019;t it be best if we pull him out immediately?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;We can&#x2019;t say for sure that he is an ally yet. &#xA0;&#xA0;I have no idea what he&#x2019;ll do. &#xA0;Let me talk to him first.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Mmmm. &#xA0;All right. &#xA0;Please hurry. &#xA0;The concentration of Energy looks quite serious. &#xA0;I believe the Dimensional Admin is getting ready to descend.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Understood. &#xA0;Where&#x2019;s his current location?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Captain Leone fiddled with the tablet attached to his wrist, and a hologram map appeared. &#xA0;A bright dot could be seen. &#xA0;Leone gave an answer.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;It is the Seoul Station&#x2019;s 1st Exit. &#xA0;The energy loss rate is 28%.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Understood.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What if you aren&#x2019;t able to persuade him?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;&#x2026;&#x2026;.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">The Code needed for a Reset wasn&#x2019;t with Iello anymore. &#xA0;Kahng-woojin possessed it. &#xA0;If they wanted to revert the already damaged earth, they needed him.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;We need him even if he have to force his cooperation.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Mmm. &#xA0;All right.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Then let us start.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The captain shook Toppler&#x2019;s hand before he went on his way.</span></p><p><span style="">Leone&#x2019;s ship locked into the target, and Toppler used the space ship as a Dimensional Interface&#x2026;.</span></p><p><span style="">***</span></p><p><span style="">Flying Fortress Bibi&#x2019;s Castle.</span></p><p><span style="">The serious atmosphere around Kahng-woojin prevented Jung-minchan from opening his mouth. &#xA0;He decided to delay the report to another time.</span></p><p><span style="">The battle between Iello and Kahng-woojin started not too long ago. &#xA0;This was why Japan had already announced their alliance with Iello. &#xA0;Now they had sent a strongly worded requests to Alandal &#xA0;asking for an explanation.</span></p><p><span style="">Jung-minchan was in a bind, because Japan was showing signs of starting a war over this incident. &#xA0;He had no choice, but to ignore it.</span></p><p><span style="">If he gave the report at an ill-advised time, Woojin might want to invade Japan. &#xA0;They would be in a deeper mess if such a thing happened.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Did something happen?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Please leave master alone&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style=""> &#x201C;Yes.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Even Bibi sounded serious, so Minchan had to accept the situation. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">When Woojin arrived at the Flying Fortress, the first person he visited wasn&#x2019;t his mother or his sister. &#xA0;It was Kim-kahngchul, who had been locked up.</span></p><p><span style="">Ggee-eeeek.</span></p><p><span style="">Kim-kahngchul was just sitting in place, yet Kahng-woojin suddenly threw a punch in Kim-kahngchul&#x2019;s face.</span></p><p><span style="">Gwah-dahng.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Koo-oohk.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Kim-kahngchul unceremoniously fell over. &#xA0;Woojin grabbed him by the back of his neck, and he spoke as he grinded his teeth.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;How will I be able to meet those Moon World bastards.?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Kook. &#xA0;Even if you ask me...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Kwah-dahng.</span></p><p><span style="">Kim-kahngchul was roughly thrown to the floor again, and Woojin growled at him.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Call those bastards to me.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Shouldn&#x2019;t you go ask this of the Holy Maiden of earth?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">When he spoke about the Holy Maiden of Earth, Woojin grabbed Kim-kahngchul&#x2019;s neck. &#xA0;Woojin easily raised Kim-kahngchul by his throat. &#xA0;Hechoked as his legs futilely struggled.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;You want to die?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Koo-oohk. &#xA0;E...earth&#x2019;s god is in their world&#x2026;.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">When it looked as if he could no longer breathe, Woojin put him down. &#xA0;Woojin&#x2019;s eyes narrowed as he perked up at his words.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;The god of earth is on the Moon World?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Koo-oohk. &#xA0;That is true to my knowledge.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;&#x2026;&#x2026;.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">He knew the Executioner could sever the connection between the Dimensions. &#xA0;If this was the only solution, he had to acquire it.</span></p><p><span style="">However, the earth&#x2019;s Master Code&#x2026;. &#xA0;What if it was a task that required his dongsaeng?</span></p><p><span style="">If there was a way to save earth, while he saved his sister&#x2026;..</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Moon World&#x2026;. How do I get there?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">He opened his Dimensional Store to find a Dungeon that linked towards the Moon World. &#xA0;He couldn&#x2019;t find it. &#xA0;If one wanted to link to a location, a Dungeon was needed.</span></p><p><span style="">Ggee-eeek.</span></p><p><span style="">At that moment, an unexpected figure stepped in as he opened the door.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;&#x2026;&#x2026;?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;We meet again.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">At Dr. Toppler&#x2019;s greeting, Woojin&#x2019;s expression remained crumpled.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I want you to guide me to the Moon World.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">If the god of earth was there... &#xA0;He&#x2019;ll kill the god for his dongsaeng. &#xA0;He&#x2019;ll acquire the Master Code.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;You can&#x2019;t reach there using conventional methods.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;If you know what is good for you, you&#x2019;ll guide me there.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin took a step forward. &#xA0;It was just a single step, but the sense of danger made Dr. Toppler flinched. &#xA0;However, he held his ground.</span></p><p><span style="">It was the same for him and the Moon World. &#xA0;They no longer had the luxury of stepping backwards.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I&#x2019;ll guide you. &#xA0;However, you have to listen to my words before I do so.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I don&#x2019;t need to.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;It is related to the origin of the Dimensions. &#xA0;It is also about the origin of the Dungeons, which allows travel between Dimensions. &#xA0;Everything I&#x2019;m telling you is the truth.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin&#x2019;s eyebrows twitched.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;The origin of Trahnet&#x2026;. Don&#x2019;t you want to know about it?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Stop talking shit. &#xA0;Just tell me about the Dungeon that leads to the Moon World&#xFF01;&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;There are no Dungeons on the Moon World.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin&#x2019;s face crumpled further.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;You can summon me&#xFF01;&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">It was a method that worked on Alphen. &#xA0;He just had to accept the summon.</span></p><p><span style="">However&#x2026;.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Unfortunately, you cannot go there through a summon. &#xA0;There are no portals, and it isn&#x2019;t possible to use Dimensional Shifts. &#xA0;However, I do know of one method that&#x2019;ll work.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin&#x2019;s eyes twitched.</span></p><p><span style="">If there wasn&#x2019;t a way, Kim-kahngchul and Toppler would be dead already.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What is it?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;You can log out.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;&#x2026;&#x2026;.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Toppler calmly accepted the fearsome glare of Kahng-woojin, and he gave a prayer inside.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Please listen to my words before you do anything..&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;&#x2026;&#x2026;.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Trahnet. &#xA0;This is about origin of the transcendent travel between planets, and it is about the future of humanity.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Woojin took another step towards Toppler.</span></p>
