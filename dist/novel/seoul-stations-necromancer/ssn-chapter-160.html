<p><span style="">Chapter 160 - We are the New Recruits</span></p><p><span style="">They had expected a dangerous Dungeon to be present across the red portal. However, their expectation was broken as a well-maintained castle appeared in front of them. &#xA0;They couldn&apos;t help, but be puzzled by this.</span></p><p><span style="">Kahng-woojin was unlike his previous self where he had put the fear of god in the new recruits. &#xA0;He was unusually free and easy.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Get in line.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;&#x2026;.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I have a question.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I don&apos;t take any questions.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes, sir.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">His words were still very rough.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;You. &#xA0;Step forward.&quot; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Woojin stared at the man in front of him.</span></p><p><span style="">&lt;Lv 22 Kim-joonyong&gt; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;You are Rank E?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes. &#xA0;You are correct.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;How many abilities do you have?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I have three.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Show it to me.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;You want me to do it here?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Of course? Where else are you going to do it? &#xA0;Hurry up and show me.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes, sir!&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Kim-joonyong possessed a simple electric attack, telekinesis that could move objects, and a buff that slightly improved his physical ability.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;You really learned a motley of skills.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I...I&apos;m sorry.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">It wasn&apos;t as if he had learned these abilities, because he wanted to learn them. &#xA0;&#xA0;He naturally developed these Roused abilities. &#xA0;The problem was that his abilities didn&apos;t complement each other at all.</span></p><p><span style="">Then he had hesitated in determining which ability he wanted to focus on. &#xA0;This in turn delayed his growth. &#xA0;He was what many people referred to as a mutt.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What are you sorry for?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">However, Woojin liked the mutt characters the most. The strengthening of abilities could be resolved by working them hard. &#xA0;However, it was better to have numerous abilities. This man hadn&apos;t used Skill Books. &#xA0;He had naturally developed three Roused Skills, and that was respectable.</span></p><p><span style="">It meant he had high growth potential.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Eat this.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Woojin purchased a Reinforcement Stone that went well with Kim-joonyong from the Dimensional store. &#xA0;The Items he bought from the Achievement Store was non-transferable. &#xA0;However, the Items bought from Dimensional Store could be given to others, and the intrinsic effect within these Items weren&apos;t diminished at all.</span></p><p><span style="">Then there were the Items from the miscellaneous store, Reinforcement Stone store, weapons shop and others buildings located in his Domain. &#xA0;He had access to their products through the Dimensional Store.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;W...what is this?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I won&apos;t take any questions.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;&#x2026;.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">He didn&apos;t know what it was yet he was expected to eat it?</span></p><p><span style="">Kim-joonyong looked ready to cry as he received the Reinforcement Stone. &#xA0;The Roused next to him had been watching Kim-joonyong, and he was cautious as he spoke up.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;It looks like a Reinforcement Stone. Just shut up and absorb it.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;R...really?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Kim-joonyong held the Reinforcement Stone as if he couldn&apos;t believe what was happening. &#xA0;Kim-joonyong was confused by his current situation.</span></p><p><span style="">His eyes met Kahng-woojin&apos;s eyes.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I&apos;m always right. &#xA0;Hurry up and eat it. &#xA0;Do it before you die.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;&#x2026;!&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">He wasn&#x2019;t sure if Woojin was nice or brutal.</span></p><p><span style="">Kim-joonyong opened his eyes after absorbing the Reinforcement Stone, and he saw several more laid out in front of him.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Eat it in order.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">When he turned his gaze, he caught sight of all the other people absorbing the Reinforcement Stones.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Is it really ok to shovel all of this into us?&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">He wanted to ask the question, but he knew he would be disciplined again. &#xA0;So he didn&apos;t dare voice his question.</span></p><p><span style="">Even the ones that inadequately increased one&apos;s abilities were expensive. &#xA0;Even if he was given a inefficient Reinforcement Stone, it was basically a luxury item. &#xA0;He couldn&apos;t believe his luck today. &#xA0;He&#x2019;ll be able to absorb numerous Reinforcement Stones in a row.</span></p><p><span style="">The Reinforcement Stone were of the highest quality. &#xA0;He could feel his strength increase.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;How much was this all worth? &#xA0;Several hundred thousand dollars?&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">These were amazing Items that he couldn&apos;t even dream about eating, yet Kahng-woojin was shoveling these Items towards him. &#xA0;Kahn-woojin looked like an angel to him right now.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I want you to learn all of this.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Woojin gave him consecutive Skill Books. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">Even the worst Skill Books were worth couple hundred thousand dollars. &#xA0;This was how laughable money was in regards to Skills. &#xA0;The amount of Items he consumed was worth couple hundred thousand...no, it might sell for millions on auction.</span></p><p><span style="">He was only a Rank E Roused. &#xA0;The gifts were too excessive to merely call it a kindness.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;I&apos;m sure he is a Tsundere.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">Kim-jongyoon thought he had a rough idea on what was going on.</span></p><p><span style="">He now knew what kind of man Kahng-woojin was.</span></p><p><span style="">Kim-joonyong looked at him with eyes full of good will.</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin silently waited as the twenty three new recruits absorbed the Reinforcement Stones, and they learned the Skills.</span></p><p><span style="">They needed a basic foundation of Skills and Stats. &#xA0;Then they could be trained.</span></p><p><span style="">The fact that he knew their level, and what type of abilities they possessed didn&apos;t mean he could discern their battle style and tendencies. &#xA0;This meant he had to let them loose after teaching them the basics. The path for their growth will will eventually be revealed.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Well, if you are done, we are going to the training ground.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">He had already closed the earlier portal he had used to return here. &#xA0;He had no choice, but to go through Necia&apos;s Pillar if he wanted to reach Planet Jaku.</span></p><p><span style="">When they followed him through the portal, they arrived at a Dungeon where the enormous Necia&apos;s Pillar was located at. These new recruits exited the Domain, and they took their first steps onto the Planet Jaku.</span></p><p><span style="">Their expressions varied. &#xA0;There were fear, excitement, anticipation, confidence, tension and other emotions. &#xA0;There was a broad spectrum of emotions on their faces.</span></p><p><span style="">They were scared, but it seemed they wanted to test out their newly learned Skills, and the newly absorbed power from the Reinforcement Stones.</span></p><p><span style="">However, it wouldn&#x2019;t be efficient for him to teach each one of them. &#xA0;This was the reason why he had trained underlings beforehand, so they could do the work for him.</span></p><p><span style="">Kahhhhhhhk! </span></p><p><span style="">A roar split the sky. &#xA0;The new recruits whispered to each other as they saw the Wyvern approaching their location.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;It&apos;s a monster! &#xA0;It&apos;s a Wyvern!&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Shit. &#xA0;Isn&apos;t it too strong for our first battle?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;No. &#xA0;Look over there. &#xA0;There is a person on top of it.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">They were talking to each other as if they were on a picnic. &#xA0;Woojin smirked when he saw this.</span></p><p><span style="">Grow up fast and well.</span></p><p><span style="">The person, who appeared on the Wyvern, was none other than Che-haesol. &#xA0;She had come here when Woojin called for her.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I&apos;m sorry I&apos;m late.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;It&apos;s fine. &#xA0;You&#x2019;ll do well in teaching the new recruits. &#xA0;Try to find out their tendencies.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes, sir.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;We are returning to earth in 12 days. &#xA0;These guys will now be directly under your command.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;A unit under me!&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;This is why you learned the Telepathy skill. &#xA0;Now you can use it properly.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Haesol felt her heart beat faster.</span></p><p><span style="">She had learned the Telepathy skill, so she would someday directly command a unit.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;How much do I have to train them?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Well, it is up to you. &#xA0;Just make sure they are adequately useful.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;adequate.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">She spoke softly as she repeated his words. &#xA0;Woojin patted Haesol&apos;s shoulder.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I&apos;ll see you later.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes, sir!&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Woojin summoned his Phantom Steed Shing Shing. &#xA0;He got on, and he disappeared in the opposite direction from where Haesol had arrived. &#xA0;She was trying very hard not to smile as she looked at the 23 new recruits that had been abandoned on a foreign planet.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;They are my new recruits.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">How long had it been? </span></p><p><span style="">This was different from looking at the new recruits during her military days.</span></p><p><span style="">These were her subordinates under her direct command! &#xA0;It felt as if she had been given the opportunity to lead a special forces unit.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Get into a column with 4 lines.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;&#x2026;?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Haesol grinned when she saw their puzzled face.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Do as you are told.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">The group was still slow to move. &#xA0;Kim-joonyong, who was in the front of the line, asked her a question.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Excuse me. &#xA0;Are you director Che-haesol?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">These were Roused, who had interviewed, because they wanted to join Alandal. &#xA0;There were only few Roused in Alandal, so Che-haesol was already famous. &#xA0;Of course, he recognized her.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I am.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Heh heh. &#xA0;I look forward to working with you.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;&#x2026;.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Haesol stared at the hand extended by Kim-joonyong.</span></p><p><span style="">Shoook, puh-uhk! </span></p><p><span style="">Haesol&apos;s fist moved past Kim-joonhyong&apos;s outstretched hand, and it buried itself deeply in his stomach.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;If you aren&apos;t given a order, don&apos;t move.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;&#x2026;!&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ggoo-ooh-oohk.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Kim-joonyong was writhing on the floor as he moaned. &#xA0;The new Roused recruits were frozen in place. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">Did everyone in Alandal not know about human rights?</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Eeek. &#xA0;Why did you suddenly do that? &#xA0;I want to be trained by the president.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">It looked as if Che-haesol was posturing unnecessarily to make herself look strong. &#xA0;Kahng-woojin had unhesitatingly given him Items, so he thought Kahng-woojin was thousand times better than her.</span></p><p><span style="">Instead of answering, Haesol&apos;s foot answered his hostile attitude.</span></p><p><span style="">Puh-uhk. </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Kuh-oohk!&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Joonyong was sent flying 3 meters. &#xA0;He rolled across the floor as he let out a moan.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;You can&apos;t even crawl, yet you are trying to fly?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">He wanted to be trained by Kahng-woojin?</span></p><p><span style="">He was asking for his own death. &#xA0;The only person here that would most definitely kill a person for being slow was the King of Alandal, Kahng-woojin. </span></p><p><span style="">He didn&apos;t differentiate between the living and the dead.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;You can&apos;t crawl yet. &#xA0;However, I&apos;ll make is so that you can walk.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;&#x2026;.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">She had received an order from the king.</span></p><p><span style="">She was told to make them into adequate Roused.&#x2026;&#x2026;. </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I am tasked to making you guys into Rank B Roused in 12 days. &#xA0;This is the start to your hellish training.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;&#x2026;?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Most of them were Rank E. &#xA0;There were only several Rank D Roused sprinkled in the group, yet she was suddenly aiming for Rank B? &#xA0;If one reached that Rank, most guilds promoted one to director.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;We&apos;ll start the training.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Kee-ahhhhk! </span></p><p><span style="">Che-haesol somehow looked very cheerful. &#xA0;As if to answer her cheerful voice, the Wyvern let out a long answering cry.</span></p><p><span style="">*** </span></p><p><span style="">Lava was boiling across this large stretch of land.</span></p><p><span style="">It would have been better if this lava had been emitted by a volcano.</span></p><p><span style="">He couldn&apos;t avoid it. &#xA0;Dodging was useless.</span></p><p><span style="">From within the lava, the Flame Dragon Hydra was continuously letting out flame from its mouth. &#xA0;There was a person flying across this hot stretch of land, and he was nimbly dodging the Flame Breath.</span></p><p><span style="">There was 1 living being and 1 dead being watching from afar.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Sunggoo is pretty decent now.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">[Goo-ha-ha. &#xA0;The bastard got quickly used to being wrapped in flames.] </span></p><p><span style="">Sunggoo&apos;s ability to adapt to Flame type magic was peerless.</span></p><p><span style="">No magician would get burnt from the flame that was made by oneself. &#xA0;One was able to safely control one&#x2019;s flame through magical energy.</span></p><p><span style="">However, there were those few that could assimilate other&#x2019;s magical energy. &#xA0;This type of person could then absorb the enemy&#x2019;s attack.</span></p><p><span style="">Sunggoo had just entered into a level where he was able to do this.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;He always talked about wanting to be a magician. &#xA0;He got his wish.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Sungoo was desperately dodging from location to location. &#xA0;If one saw his face right now, it made one question if he was truly happy from achieving this goal. &#xA0;However, Woojin had helped him achieve the goal he always talked about.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;We have 11 days left. &#xA0;I want you to teach him well until then.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">[Goo-ha-ha. &#xA0;I&apos;ll make it so that he&apos;ll be fine even if he was roasted by the fires of hell.] </span></p><p><span style="">Woojin nodded his head in satisfaction.</span></p><p><span style="">Jaenis was always reliable.</span></p><p><span style="">*** </span></p><p><span style="">The Colony took 4 days to clear.</span></p><p><span style="">The Colony city was occupied by a very striking ogre with a red beard. &#xA0;&#xA0;Do-jaemin and his party members continued to use guerrilla tactics, and they were able to lure out the Dimensional lord and kill it.</span></p><p><span style="">It was easy to clear a Colony without its Dimensional lord. &#xA0;The Dimensional lord could no longer refill his forces using the Dimensional store. &#xA0;They were slow and steady in their attack. &#xA0;The number of enemies were decreasing incrementally, and their eradication was only a matter of time.</span></p><p><span style="">Moreover, the forces defending the Colony weren&#x2019;t all elite troops.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Kneel before me. &#xA0;This is the difference between you and I&#x2026;.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Jaemin. &#xA0;Stop playing around. &#xA0;We have to go quickly.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes, hyung-nim.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Do-jaemin&apos;s movements were more relaxed than before, and his battles were more even keeled.</span></p><p><span style="">It looked as if he had lost some of the majesty of being a Noble of the Night, but this only proved to enhance his presence more.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Whew. &#xA0;Alandal is all full of monsters.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Haha. &#xA0;Jungdoh hyung-nim should join Alandal.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I have so many families depending on me. &#xA0;How can I do such a thing?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Heh heh. We&apos;ll move after I drink from this one.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Baek-jungdoh couldn&apos;t help, but laugh. &#xA0;Alandal was really filled with monsters. &#xA0;Even now Hong-sunggoo was the main reason behind the wildfire spreading across this planet, and Do-jaemin had easily leaped frogged Baek-jungdoh in terms of power.</span></p><p><span style="">Then there was the powerful Holy Magic of the Holy Maiden. &#xA0;She could bring anyone back to life if the person had a single breath left. Blanka&apos;s improvement in his abilities were slow, but he was quickly meshing well with the party.</span></p><p><span style="">Do-jaemin drank the blood from the troll he defeated. &#xA0;He was able to receive a portion of its ability, and his Stats would increase a little bit. &#xA0;His regeneration ability would slightly improve too.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;You are eating well now.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Woojin appeared on his Phantom Steed. &#xA0;He dismounted.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Uh, hyung. &#xA0;You are here? &#xA0;Is it time to do a Dimensional Battle?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes. &#xA0;We have a little time left. &#xA0;I want you to finish what you are eating.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes, hyung.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Do-jaemin started to drink from the troll&apos;s neck again. &#xA0;It seemed he had fully accepted that he was a vampire. &#xA0;It seemed his sense of identity as a human had lessened. He looked pretty natural when he drank the blood.</span></p><p><span style="">However, Baek-jungdoh wasn&apos;t still used to it. &#xA0;He look on with a bit of uneasiness on his face.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;We have two days left.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Whew. &#xA0;Time really flies.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">In terms of earth time, one week had passed. &#xA0;In terms of how much time passed here, it had been almost a month. &#xA0;They would be returning to earth in 2 days. &#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;Baek-jungdoh also had gained a lot during that time. &#xA0;It was a little bit of a let down, only because the people around him were growing at the pace of monsters.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Will hyung go to Alphen on the 1st trip?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hoo hoo. &#xA0;I&apos;m thankful for the offer, but I can&apos;t. &#xA0;I have to form an official expedition group that&apos;ll be sent from the KH guild.</span></p><p><span style="">Alphen was a completely different situation from Jaku. &#xA0;Over half of the Dimensional lords in Alphen occupied one of the 72 great thrones.</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin had made a clean sweep of the Yellow Lizard Coalition on earth, so there had been a power vacuum in Jaku. The difficulty of the situation on Alphen was on a whole different level.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Well, I&apos;ll see you in 2 days.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&quot;With pleasure.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Woojin opened a portal, and he took Do-jaemin, who was used to traveling now, back to his Dimensional Domain.</span></p>
