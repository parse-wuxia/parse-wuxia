<p>Chapter 192 - Blood Dragon (1)</p><p><span style="">The sound of the ground shaking tickled one&#x2019;s ears.</span></p><p><span style="">The vibration was transferred from the ground to one&#x2019;s feet. &#xA0;One&#x2019;s entire body shook.</span></p><p><span style="">Koo-koohng, koohng!</span></p><p><span style="">The sound of clashes was heard from all direction, so one didn&#x2019;t even need to look around to find the source of the sounds.</span></p><p><span style="">Enemies were everywhere, and it was a mishmash of all races.</span></p><p><span style="">Orcs, Ogres, Elves, and even humans&#x2026;.</span></p><p><span style="">The creatures of his Dimensions answered the call of Ibrit. &#xA0;All of them charged forward to fight Kahng-woojin and his Undead Army.</span></p><p><span style="">All the monsters, who had crawled out of the Dungeons of Seoul, stopped destroying the city. &#xA0;They headed towards the Immortal.</span></p><p><span style="">Koo-koohng, koohng.</span></p><p><span style="">The roads that should be filled with vehicles were now clogged by the marching monsters. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">The Roused and soldiers on standby looked on with confusion. &#xA0;From their perspective, it as if the monsters were retreating. &#xA0;However, if one looked at it in a macro view, the monsters were gathering at a single point.</span></p><p><span style="">The monsters were all rushing towards the islet.</span></p><p><span style="">Enemies were everywhere.</span></p><p><span style="">Their eyes were red with resentment. &#xA0;They were sending out an almost instinctual killing intent towards Woojin, and it was laughable to him.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;It seems all the trashes from the other Dimensions are gathering here..&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Dimensional Refugees.</span></p><p><span style="">These were beings, who had lost their Codes. &#xA0;They were unfortunate individuals, who had lost their home planets. &#xA0;They were puppets that could be summoned if one had Points.</span></p><p><span style="">These beings bared their teeth towards toward him, and Woojin&#x2019;s personality wasn&#x2019;t benevolent enough to try to passively explain the situation with his words.</span></p><p><span style="">He resided closest to death.</span></p><p><span style="">He was the king of that defied death.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I&#x2019;ll clean this place.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">With death&#x2026;.</span></p><p><span style="">Shwahhhh!</span></p><p><span style="">The souls materialized around Woojin, and they were formed into a large soul barrier.</span></p><p><span style="">Zeeeeeeng.</span></p><p><span style="">The cape on his armor fluttered as if it was about to be ripped away.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x3008;Thrash&#x2019;s Guardian&#x3009;</span></p><p><span style="">When he repaired the damaged chest armor, all the restriction was lifted. &#xA0;He could now use and store an unlimited amount of souls. &#xA0;It also increased his power by three folds.</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin also switched his shoes.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x3008;Thrash&#x2019;s March&#x3009;</span></p><p><span style="">He left behind the energy of death at every step he took. &#xA0;It acted as a multiplier of Undead&#x2019;s battle capability. &#xA0;Moreover, his footsteps corrupted the ground with poison. &#xA0;It lured all living being towards death.</span></p><p><span style="">Then there was the belt decorated with skulls.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x3008;Thrash&#x2019;s Dignity&#x3009;</span></p><p><span style="">In front of the Thrash&#x2019;s Dignity, the number of subordinate he could control increased.</span></p><p><span style="">Just this single Item doubled his Control ability. </span></p><p><span style="">The only thing lacking right now was two remaining set Items. &#xA0;He didn&#x2019;t have enough ingredient Items to make Honor and Punishment.</span></p><p><span style="">The flying fortress needed Points for its defense, so he couldn&#x2019;t be careless with his use of his Points. &#xA0;He had already depleted his Achievement Points by buying from his personal store. &#xA0;He was only able to complete three Items.</span></p><p><span style="">He would have to gather all five Items to bring out the full set effect. &#xA0;His Undead army would become much stronger numerically and quality wise once he had them all.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Shall we go?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Shwahhhhk.</span></p><p><span style="">When barrier was taken down, the sound of pitched battle between the Undeads and the monsters rang in his ears.</span></p><p><span style="">Hoo-ooh-oohk!</span></p><p><span style="">When Woojin started walking, souls gathered at his feet to assist his steps.</span></p><p><span style="">Even if he wasn&#x2019;t riding Shing Shing, Thrash&#x2019;s March allowed him to use Phantom Gallop. &#xA0;It was childsplay to be in the air now. </span></p><p><span style="">He could walk to anywhere he wanted to.</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin jumped into the empty air, and he started running towards the Orc Warriors, who were crossing the Hahn River by jumping on a congregation of Alligators.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;How should I use this?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin held up his Warrior&#x2019;s Weapon.</span></p><p><span style="">Shwahhhhk!</span></p><p><span style="">His weapon was long, and it wrapped around an Orc&#x2019;s head. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">It was a whip.</span></p><p><span style="">When he reached level 90, his weapon could now transform into a whip. &#xA0;It could move in unexpected ways, and it possessed a sharp cutting force. &#xA0;It could slice through anything. </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Koo-ah-ahk.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Before the Orc could stop its scream, its corpse exploded, and a Skeleton appeared..</span></p><p><span style="">Kee-kee-keek.</span></p><p><span style="">His Control Ability had doubled.</span></p><p><span style="">The enemies kept dying one by one, and the Undead army kept getting larger.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Kill the Necromancer!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Kill that bastard!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Humans, elves&#x2026;. &#xA0;Even Dwarven Warriors were starting to cross the Hahn River. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">There were so many of them. &#xA0;If one didn&#x2019;t know this was Seoul, one would think it was the territory of the monsters.</span></p><p><span style="">Pah-paht, paht!</span></p><p><span style="">Light pillars were shooting consecutively into the skies of Seoul, and one could tell a lot of Dungeon were being reset.</span></p><p><span style="">Since the Dungeons could forgo the Synchronization, the monsters kept crawling out of the Dungeons. &#xA0;The guilds and the army didn&#x2019;t have the time to stem the flow.</span></p><p><span style="">Even the residents of Seoul didn&#x2019;t have the time to evacuate. &#xA0;People were becoming stranded in the streets, and they were being killed.</span></p><p><span style="">This was a great lord of the 70th Throne.</span></p><p><span style="">Ibrit&#x2019;s authority made every monster gather at the islet.</span></p><p><span style="">Ironically, this gave time for the civilians to run away.</span></p><p><span style="">Some ran towards the opposite direction as the monsters. &#xA0;Some gave up running away, and they decided to wait for a rescue. &#xA0;A very small number of people watched and filmed the battle occurring on the islet.</span></p><p><span style="">[Koo-oh-oh! &#xA0;It is too bad Kiba cannot join us.]</span></p><p><span style="">Death Knight Ramson swung his hammer with regret. &#xA0;Even for the Death Knights, who were quite used to battles, it was rare to face a continuous stream of enemies.</span></p><p><span style="">They killed and killed, yet there was no end to the enemies.</span></p><p><span style="">The air of the battlefield was oppressive and dense from the fear and madness emanating from the living. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">[How great is this?]</span></p><p><span style="">The Death Knights willingly became drunk on this atmosphere.</span></p><p><span style="">Hwah-roo-roo, gwahng!</span></p><p><span style="">The Hell Hydras appeared from various locations, and they spat out fire from their mouths.</span></p><p><span style="">Lich Jaenis used his enormous staff to shoot consecutive magical spells. &#xA0;The magical energy around him was so thick that Jaenis&#x2019; face looked red.</span></p><p><span style="">[Come to me! &#xA0;I will save you all!]</span></p><p><span style="">If living caused pain, he&#x2019;ll save all of them by killing them.</span></p><p><span style="">The Lich&#x2019;s magic was endless.</span></p><p><span style="">[Goo-oh-oh!]</span></p><p><span style="">Che-che-che-cheng, tee-teeng!</span></p><p><span style="">Every time the Iron Golem moved the nearby trees fell and the corpses piled up.</span></p><p><span style="">The monsters that seemed to have stepped out from literary fame died. &#xA0;The swords, shields and anything made out of metal were pulled towards the body of the Golem. &#xA0;&#xA0;The Golem was like a magnet, and its body kept growing in size.</span></p><p><span style="">The corpses kept piling up, and now it was filling the Hahn river. &#xA0;Blood was flowing out of these corpses, and it was like a river made out of blood.</span></p><p><span style="">Koo-ooh-oohng!</span></p><p><span style="">An enormous being was raging around as it raised violent sprays of water.</span></p><p><span style="">[What is your wish?]</span></p><p><span style="">The Bone Dragon kept asking a question that no one answered. &#xA0;It kept chewing up its preys.</span></p><p><span style="">Gwah-gwahng!</span></p><p><span style="">The red water sprayed into the air, and the rolling of the water doused the surrounding.</span></p><p><span style="">Before one knew it, there were mostly Undead and corpses left around Woojin.</span></p><p><span style="">It happened at that moment.</span></p><p><span style="">The Undying Crow, who had shot high into the air, was diving towards the ground.</span></p><p><span style="">Koo-ah-ahng!</span></p><p><span style="">The Bone Dragon leaped into the air to ram into Ibrit. &#xA0;Ibrit became lodged in the Thorn Tree. &#xA0;It shot out its sharp feathers indiscriminately, and it decimated the surrounding.</span></p><p><span style="">Shwahhhk!</span></p><p><span style="">The whip flew in like a snake, and it encircled the Crow&#x2019;s neck.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I caught you&#x2026;. Uh?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin was speaking with a smirk on his face. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">However, when Ibrit jumped, Woojin and his whip was dragged along by its enormous strength.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Huh. &#xA0;Jeez..&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The whip was sharp, yet it couldn&#x2019;t even pierce through Ibrit&#x2019;s skin. &#xA0;It couldn&#x2019;t even harm the feather on its body. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin hung onto his whip, and Ibrit kept increasing its speed as it ascended into the sky.</span></p><p><span style="">He could do nothing by being dragged around everywhere, so Woojin unsummoned his Warrior&#x2019;s Weapon. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">He landed atop a branch of the Thorn Tree.</span></p><p><span style="">Shwahk!</span></p><p><span style="">[I guess I&#x2019;ll watch you perform more cute tricks.]</span></p><p><span style="">Ibrit spoke after climbing high into the sky, and Woojin tried to hold back his bitter laugh.</span></p><p><span style="">The bastard was waiting for him to tire out.</span></p><p><span style="">Moreover, the Dungeons nearby were resetting, so Woojin surmised Ibrit had some kind of a scheme.</span></p><p><span style="">Seventieth Throne.</span></p><p><span style="">It had the Codes to 70 planets, so how much Points did it have saved up?</span></p><p><span style="">How large of an army could it field if it used all its Points?</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;So you are saying you can&#x2019;t take me on yet?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">It was waiting for Woojin to tire out, so basically, it was admitting to a weakness. &#xA0;Ibrit&#x2019;s combat ability was below his.</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin looked &#xA0;down from the Thorn Tree.</span></p><p><span style="">The Undead Army was surrounded by dead bodies, and the still living enemies were being slaughtered.</span></p><p><span style="">The corpses were clogging the Hahn river, and now it was acting as a bridge. &#xA0;The monsters, who were still arriving at the Hahn river, used the corpse bridge to cross.</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin smirked.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Unsummon.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Shwahhhk.</span></p><p><span style="">The Skeletons, Death Knights, Lich and the Bone Dragon disappeared.</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin was the only one left on the islet.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;The Necromancer has run out of magic!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Kill that bastard!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The monsters&#x2026;. &#xA0;To be precise, the Dimensional refugees ran towards Woojin as if it was a race to reach him.</span></p><p><span style="">When they arrived at the islet, some tried to climbed the tree. &#xA0;The impatient ones threw their spears, or they shot their arrows. &#xA0;In a flash, tens of thousands of enemy troops gathered on the island.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Do you guys really think I&#x2019;m short on magical energy?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin&#x2019;s two hands were pointed downwards.</span></p><p><span style="">There were corpses and screaming souls everywhere.</span></p><p><span style="">How could he be low on magical energy?</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Corpse Explosion.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Ggoo-ahhhhhhng!</span></p><p><span style="">All the corpses exploded. &#xA0;The explosion swallowed everything nearby. &#xA0;The explosion caused more corpses to form. &#xA0;The number of corpses was much higher than before. &#xA0;Blood and chunks of flesh flew everywhere, and the surrounding looked like a scene from hell.</span></p><p><span style="">The aftermath of the explosion destroyed the island.</span></p><p><span style="">Koo-ooh-ooh-oohng.</span></p><p><span style="">The Thorn Tree shook fiercely. &#xA0;It seemed as it would fall over, but the roots suddenly hardened as it pierced into the surface.</span></p><p><span style="">Half of the Hahn river&#x2019;s water evaporated, and the red water rushed in to fill the void.</span></p><p><span style="">Moreover, Woojin&#x2019;s eyes could see tens of thousand of souls&#x2026;.</span></p><p><span style="">Shwahhhh.</span></p><p><span style="">All of them were sucked into the Thrash&#x2019;s Protection. &#xA0;He absorbed several hundred souls, and his almost depleted magical energy was filled to the brim.</span></p><p><span style="">Moreover, if he wanted to use Skeleton Summon again, he had more than enough sacrifices. &#xA0;His surrounding was filled with blood, bones and corpses&#x2026;.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Summon.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">[Goo-oh-oh!]</span></p><p><span style="">He summoned his Undead army again, and they met the charge of the roaring monsters, who were coming towards him again.</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin looked up to see the Undying Crow, then he looked towards his Bone Dragon.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hey, Yong Yong. &#xA0;It is our turn to counterattack.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">[What is your wish?]</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What is your wish?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The Dragon, who suffered from dementia, was usually chatty. &#xA0;However, it was silent now. The corner of Woojin&#x2019;s mouth started turn up.</span></p><p><span style="">It was his baddest and strongest Familiar.</span></p><p><span style="">After a short silence, Yong Yong spoke a desire he always had for the past couple thousand years.</span></p><p><span style="">[Give me wings.]</span></p><p><span style="">A flightless dragon wasn&#x2019;t a true dragon.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I&#x2019;d love to give it to you.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin smiled as he looked at the Iron Golem.</span></p><p><span style="">[Goo-uh-uh.]</span></p><p><span style="">Koong, koong, koo-koohng.</span></p><p><span style="">The chunks of steel, which made up its armor, started to fall off. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">In the end, only the wisp-like heart of the Golem was left. &#xA0;It started to suck up the nearby blood.</span></p><p><span style="">Shwahhhhk!</span></p><p><span style="">It was like a fog made out of blood&#x2026;.</span></p><p><span style="">The blood swirled like a whirlwind, yet it unexpectedly gathered around the Bone Dragon.</span></p><p><span style="">The Golem&#x2019;s Heart had settled within the enormous ribcage of the Bone Dragon, and it sucked in all the blood nearby.</span></p><p><span style="">[Goo-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh.]</span></p><p><span style="">The Dragon roared, and it stretched itself out. &#xA0;Blood started to stick to the bones. &#xA0;The blood coagulated, and it started resolving itself into flesh. &#xA0;&#xA0;The bones of the wings, which looked like spears, started to grow a membrane.</span></p><p><span style="">Blood started covering the reddened bones and the bridge of its nose.</span></p><p><span style="">Shwahhh.</span></p><p><span style="">It absorbed an endless amount of blood&#x2026;. &#xA0;Blood....</span></p><p><span style="">Tens of thousand were sacrificed to combine the power of his two baddest Familiars.</span></p><p><span style="">[Koo-oh-oh-oh!]</span></p><p><span style="">The Blood Dragon let out a roar, and the Fear made the monster army flinch.</span></p><p><span style="">[My wish has been granted. &#xA0;What is your wish?]</span></p><p><span style="">The imposing Ancient Dragon had revived. &#xA0;Woojin laughed in a playful manner as he pointed towards the sky.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Go bring me that Crow.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">[It&#x2019;ll be my pleasure]</span></p><p><span style="">Koo-ooh-oohng!</span></p><p><span style="">It left a big mark as it pushed off, and the Blood Dragon climbed into the air.</span></p><p><span style="">Wooijn&#x2019;s magical energy had once again bottomed out, so he used the souls to replenish it. &#xA0;Woojin once again used his Control ability to its utmost on the corpses.</span></p><p><span style="">Pah-pah-paht!</span></p><p><span style="">It was as if consecutive explosions were occurring. &#xA0;The Skeletons were ripping themselves out of the corpses.</span></p><p><span style="">The Crow had been waiting for a Necromancer to become exhausted?</span></p><p><span style="">His Undead army had doubled in size, and they waited for the Immortal&#x2019;s command.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Sweep them.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">[Koo-oh-oh!]</span></p><p><span style="">At Woojin&#x2019;s order, the Death Knights roared, and the Skeletons followed them into battle. &#xA0;They charged in all directions.</span></p>
