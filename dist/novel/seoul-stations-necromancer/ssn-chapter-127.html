<p><span style="">Chapter 127 &#xA0;- Dungeon Closer (2) </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Dread?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Woojin frowned.</span></p><p><span style="">He thought about the sloshing mass of body, who had dragged its body into his Domain.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;He&apos;s trying to dig a tunnel here?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">If he thought about the time it took to synchronize the Dungeon, it meant Dread had started linking his Dungeon to earth before he had visited Woojin&#x2019;s Domain. &#xA0;However, he couldn&apos;t help, but feel unhappy about it.</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin made a choice from several selections available to him.</span></p><p><span style="">&lt;You are attempting the Clear Mode.&gt; </span></p><p><span style="">&lt;If you are successful in your Clear, you will be able to receive Achievement Points.&gt; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I&apos;m a Buff type Roused. &#xA0;I will put my blessing upon you.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">When they entered the Dungeon, Blanka tried to faithfully fulfill his role. &#xA0;Woojin frowned. &#xA0;If he was a Strengthening Type, then Woojin wouldn&apos;t have minded. &#xA0;However, the Blessing type was incompatible with him.</span></p><p><span style="">It didn&apos;t give a synergistic effect. &#xA0;In fact, it had a negative effect on him.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I don&apos;t need you. &#xA0;Just watch from the side and do nothing.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I&apos;m also a Rank A Roused. &#xA0;I can help the team...&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Blanka felt ignored, so he started to protest. &#xA0;However, Woojin was already far away. &#xA0;Baek-jungdoh shook his head from side to side as he looked at Blanka&apos;s sullen face.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;If he says wait, then just wait.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Blanka turned to look at the man, who spoke so casually towards him.</span></p><p><span style="">Blanka was an Elite Roused of the Vishnu guild. &#xA0;The guild was quite famous in India. &#xA0;This was why he was proficient in speaking Korean, Japanese and Chinese.</span></p><p><span style="">Instead of a direct battle type, he was a Support type. &#xA0;He was also very smart, so he was well acquainted with the Roused of Asia. &#xA0;He knew who had spoken to him right now.</span></p><p><span style="">It was KH guild&apos;s president Baek-jungdoh.</span></p><p><span style="">Blanka didn&apos;t know what relationship Baek-jungdoh had with Kahng-woojin, but he wasn&apos;t being helpful either.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;We entered the Dungeon as a team. &#xA0;Shouldn&apos;t we help him?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Blanka responded to Baek-jungdoh with flawless Korean.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What team? &#xA0;He&apos;ll be up in less than 5 minutes.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Blanka tilted his head in confusion at Baek-jungdoh&apos;s words.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I&apos;m an outsider, so I can understand why Kahng-woojin doesn&apos;t want to reveal his battle methods. &#xA0;So why is president Baek being treated the same way?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Kahng-woojin had become famous in such a short amount of time that there weren&apos;t many information known about him. &#xA0;However, his unsociable nature in his Dungeon Raids was one of the few things known about him. He soloed most runs, and even when he teamed up, he only worked with his guild members.</span></p><p><span style="">Since Baek-jungdoh wasn&apos;t showing any signs of joining the hunt, it seemed he was treated as an outsider too.</span></p><p><span style="">Baek-jungdoh smirked at Blanka&apos;s misunderstanding.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;There is no need to go. &#xA0;We aren&apos;t going to be of much help, so so why should we go with them?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">If Baek-jungdoh participated, would he be able to decrease the Dungeon Clear time by 10 seconds? &#xA0;It almost didn&apos;t matter if he expended his power or not.</span></p><p><span style="">Blanka was still confused. &#xA0;Baek-jungdoh sighed as he saw this.</span></p><p><span style="">When Woojin closed the five Dungeons in Japan and China, all the Roused, who tagged along with them, had reacted in the same way as Blanka. &#xA0;They all ran forward to crack Kahng-woojin&apos;s secret, but in the end, they all gained nothing.</span></p><p><span style="">No, they did earn one thing.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;He cleared out the monsters very fast and easily.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">Baek-jungdoh sat on the floor. </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Just be sure to record everything later.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Blanka had entered into the Dungeon with the party, since he wanted to see Kahng-woojin&apos;s method of clearing the Dungeon. &#xA0;This was why he was filled with more questions. </span></p><p><span style="">Whether he participated in the battle or not, Blanka had a mission. &#xA0;So why did Baek-jungdoh enter with them?</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ah. Stop looking at me with pity. &#xA0;I&apos;m just here to play. &#xA0;&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;&#x2026;?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Don&apos;t you know what a picnic is?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Of course, he knew what picnic is. &#xA0;He just wondered why they had to have a picnic in a Dungeon yet to be cleared. &#xA0;This wasn&apos;t like following mother to the market. &#xA0;Why would he come to such a dangerous...</span></p><p><span style="">Zeeeng. </span></p><p><span style="">At that moment, a red portal formed near where Baek-jungdoh was sitting. &#xA0;The meaning behind this event was self-evident.</span></p><p><span style="">All the monsters within the subway station had been cleared.</span></p><p><span style="">Only four minutes had passed. &#xA0;Baek-jungdoh smirked as he looked at Blanka&apos;s unappealing expression.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;How can everyone all have the same reaction like this?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">The reaction was the same whether the person was Japanese, Chinese or Indian.</span></p><p><span style="">Baek-jungdoh stood up, and he dusted off his behind.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Let&apos;s go. &#xA0;Let&apos;s see what shows up this time.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">After a brief moment, Kahng-woojin and Hong-sunggoo appeared. &#xA0;They all passed through the red portal.</span></p><p><span style="">Weeeeeng. </span></p><p><span style="">The tinnitus sound that tickled the ears faded. &#xA0;The sight that appeared in front of them was the view of a beach with calm waters. &#xA0;The first one to react was Sunggoo.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Wow! Isn&apos;t this place awesome, hyung-nim?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">The beach had white sands and clear waves. &#xA0;It was on par with any vacation destination on earth. &#xA0;The beach hadn&apos;t been touched by a crowded population, so there was an untainted beauty to it.</span></p><p><span style="">Sunggoo ran across the sands, and when a Crab monster burst forward, he let out a yell.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hyung-nim! There are crabs here. &#xA0;How about having some steamed crabs?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Blanka was taken aback by Sunggoo&apos;s bright laughter.</span></p><p><span style="">It was a small monster that was 50 centimetre long, but it was still too large to call it a normal crab. &#xA0;Moreover, their frightening claws could easily crush human bones.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;It&apos;s dangerous!&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">It wasn&apos;t a monster one could easily deal with.</span></p><p><span style="">Hwah-roo-rook! </span></p><p><span style="">The crab was squeezing out of the sands when Sunggoo ignited it with his flame.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Heh heh. &#xA0;It&apos;s well done.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">The crab died instantly from the high heat. &#xA0;Its shell turned red as if it was well-cooked. &#xA0;Sunggoo took out his short sword. &#xA0;If he thought about all the monsters he had to dismantle before, it would give him a headache. &#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">He was confident he could remove the meat from the crab.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;These bastards travel in a group! Let us get out of here.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">As if to validate Blanka&apos;s worries, the nearby sandy beach started to shift as monster crabs started to crawl out. &#xA0;There were so many of them that it was impossible to count them. &#xA0;There were over 100 of them.</span></p><p><span style="">If one got caught by their claws, one would be in danger of losing a limb. &#xA0;The number of crabs that showed up was on par with the Rakwis. &#xA0;The Vishnu guild had attempted this Dungeon once, and they never attempted it again. &#xA0;This was the reason why.</span></p><p><span style="">Monsters with enough offensive capability to cause fatal harm appeared in large quantity. &#xA0;It was impossible for a 10 member party to deal with all the monsters that attacked at once.</span></p><p><span style="">When he saw the crabs that had been hiding in the sandy beach, Sungoo was taken aback... No, he yelled out with a joyous expression.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Wow! This is a great harvest, hyung-nim!&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Try cooking them well. Let&apos;s start hunting after we fill our stomach.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Woojin&apos;s mouth watered when he saw the crabs. &#xA0;They were on a tight schedule, but four hours passed inside a Dungeon when one hour passed in reality. &#xA0;They had some time to spare inside the Dungeon. &#xA0;Woojin immediately took out a table and chairs.</span></p><p><span style="">He sat in a chair, then he bought refreshing beers from the Achievement Store.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Kyahhh. &#xA0;I really like doing this.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Bake-jungdoh received a head-sized wooden mug with beer filled within it. &#xA0;His face was filled with anticipation. &#xA0;One could tell he wasn&apos;t new to this kind of experience by the expression on his face.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;how can you&#x2026; This is a 6 star Dungeon.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ah. &#xA0;You speak Korean very well, foreign dude. &#xA0;Just sit here.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;&#x2026;.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Blanka sat in her seat in a moment of bewilderment. &#xA0;Soon, he saw the flames wash across the beach.</span></p><p><span style="">Hwah-roo-roohk! </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;The Fire Wall is quite useful.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Heh heh. &#xA0;Thank you, hyung-nim.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Sunggoo scratched the back of his head at Woojin&apos;s praise. &#xA0;Sunggoo picked out the well-cooked crabs, and he started cracking open the crabs. Sunggoo moved his hands in a skillful manner, while everyone else was drink their beer. &#xA0;Blanka couldn&apos;t get used to the sight.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;This place is a Dungeon.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I know.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;How can you guys not feel any sense of danger?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What reason do we have for being afraid?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;That&apos;s&#x2026;.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">The inside of a Dungeon was dangerous, so one shouldn&apos;t let go of the tension. Wasn&apos;t this common sense? Still, the current situation couldn&apos;t be called dangerous....</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Heeyah. &#xA0;Doesn&apos;t this taste better than Steamed Snow Crabs?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Baek-jungdoh was a third generation heir, so he had always eaten the best. However, he had gotten a taste of the unknown alcohol Woojin brought out, and he had eaten the monster dishes in the Dungeons. &#xA0;He enjoyed it immensely.</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin&apos;s had vast knowledge about the monsters, and his cooking skills were pretty good. &#xA0;Moreover, he tasted alcohol that was on par with anything on earth.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hey, my foreign friend. &#xA0;Don&apos;t frown so much. &#xA0;Enjoy yourself.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">They wanted him to enjoy the Dungeon.... </span></p><p><span style="">Was this really suppose to be an adventure to save one&apos;s family and nation? &#xA0;Wasn&apos;t this suppose to be a fight to the death?</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;We need another plan. &#xA0;The crabs have been taken care of, but the flame magic won&apos;t work inside the water.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">It was as Blanka said.</span></p><p><span style="">Dread was building an underwater palace. &#xA0;They would have to deal with the special environment. &#xA0;The fact that the place was underwater was an effective barrier in keeping out the intruders. &#xA0;This was one of the reasons why the Indian Roused team was unable to clear this Dungeon.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Several hundred... No, several thousand jelly fishes will swarm us. &#xA0;It&#x2019;ll be difficult to fight through them to reach the Return Stone. &#xA0;Those bastards&apos; Paralysis Poison is so strong that most Antidote doesn&apos;t work against it.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Blanka was the only one speaking in a serious manner. &#xA0;After hearing his words, Woojin stood up from his seat. &#xA0;He was pretty full from just eating a single crab leg. &#xA0;There had been a lot of crab meat.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;You just sit back and enjoy the drink. &#xA0;Several hundred to a thousand... &#xA0;That should be the right amount.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">When will he be able to do a group hunt of this size again?</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;How great would it be if all monsters just stayed calmly inside the water?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Water was a great barrier in protecting oneself from the land-bound organisms. &#xA0;However, it had &#xA0;a critical weakness.</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin used the hundred crab corpses as medium to summon the Skeleton Magicians. &#xA0;Then he unsummoned all the Skeleton Magicians that couldn&apos;t use Poison or Thunder magic. </span></p><p><span style="">In the end, 20 Skeleton Mages gathered around Woojin.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Shall we start fishing?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Woojin put his feet into the water. &#xA0;After taking several steps, the water reached Woojin&apos;s waist.</span></p><p><span style="">When an intruder appeared, the several dozen types of monsters inside the water converged towards Woojin. At the appropriate moment, Woojin used his Poison Nova.</span></p><p><span style="">Pwahhhhhk! </span></p><p><span style="">The poison mixed with the water, and it polluted the environs of the sea. &#xA0;Woojin poured out more of his magic, and the poison became more concentrated as it kept spreading farther into the distance.</span></p><p><span style="">Goo-roo-roo-rooh. </span></p><p><span style="">Poisoned swarms of jellyfishes floated to the surface. &#xA0;Woojin came back onto the beach. &#xA0;It didn&apos;t matter if the monsters had bones or not. &#xA0;Each corpse was used as medium for his summoning.</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin used the floating corpses of various fishes, crabs and jelly fishes to summon more Skeleton Magicians.</span></p><p><span style="">Pah-pah-pahk! </span></p><p><span style="">He gathered the Skeleton Magicians, who could use Thunder or Poison Magic. &#xA0;There were 500 of them.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Fuck them up.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Kee-kee-keek. </span></p><p><span style="">The Skeleton Mages shot their Thunder and Poison magic towards the sea. &#xA0;Woojin returned to the table and he sat. &#xA0;Baek-jungdoh had a broad grin on his face.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Lil bro Kahng can hunt with such ease. Huh huh.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Well, this is only true when I&apos;m hunting the weak ones.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Whether it was attacking or defending against large number of monsters, was there anyone, who could match up with Woojin? &#xA0;If several thousand to hundred thousand monster appeared in a Dungeon, it would actually be an advantage for Woojin.</span></p><p><span style="">His Skeleton Army could take care of all of them.</span></p><p><span style="">On the other hand, if a handful of strong monsters appeared in the Dungeon, the Skeleton Army would be useless against them. &#xA0;However, Woojin still had his powerful Death Knights and his personal prowess wasn&apos;t bad either.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Now we just have to wait for the octopus bastard to come out. &#xA0;Let&apos;s have a drink in the meantime.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ha ha ha. That sounds good. What do you mean by octopus?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;You&apos;ll see later.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">The Skeleton Magicians indiscriminately fired into the sea. &#xA0;When some fishes floated up to the surface, they were disappointed that they wouldn&apos;t be able to eat any sashimi. &#xA0;However, the fishes had been poisoned, so they couldn&apos;t eat it.</span></p><p><span style="">They ate the succulent crab meats, and they waited for the Dungeon Owner to appear.</span></p><p><span style="">Did 30 minute elapse?</span></p><p><span style="">Several thousand monster corpses washed up onto the beautiful beach. &#xA0;When the sight of the beach turned bizarre, the Boss Monster appeared.</span></p><p><span style="">The octopus parted the waters as it appeared, and the Skeleton Magicians focused their magic on it. &#xA0;However, a barrier was easily formed, and the magic couldn&apos;t cause any damage to the Boss Monster.</span></p><p><span style="">The eight tentacles walked on top of the water, and when it landed on the beach, Dread spoke out in anger.</span></p><p><span style="">[Koo-rooh-roohk. &#xA0;What the hell are you doing? &#xA0;Shall I consider this as a declaration of war?] </span></p><p><span style="">[You are the one, who brought the fight to me. &#xA0;Who told you to link to Earth?] </span></p><p><span style="">[Koo-roohk. That is laughable. &#xA0;You are conceited in thinking that the entirety of the Earth Dimension is yours. ] </span></p><p><span style="">No Dimensional Lord actually claimed an entire planet as one&apos;s Domain. &#xA0;However, this human in front of him named Kahng-woojin had the audacity to do so.</span></p><p><span style="">[Koohk. &#xA0;You are fearless in requesting a Clear of my Domain. You will pay for your own stupidity.] </span></p><p><span style="">Dread would have understood it if this was a Dimensional Battle where Woojin could borrow the power of his Domain. &#xA0;However, Kahng-woojin had arrogantly entered his Dungeon to clear it with a small party. &#xA0;By his own volition, &#xA0;he was challenging Dread after turning his status from &apos;Lord&apos; to &apos;Adventurer&apos;.</span></p><p><span style="">Dread could use all the power given to him by his Domain, but his opponent could only use his own personal skills.</span></p><p><span style="">While the bastard was in Death&apos;s Limbo, he&apos;ll steal the bastard&apos;s unprotected Dimensional Domain.</span></p><p><span style="">[Koo-roo-roo. &#xA0;I&apos;ll show you the power of Dread!] </span></p><p><span style="">The octupus&apos; head turned red as it showed it off in a boastful manner. Then it started to gather in magic from its surrounding. &#xA0;Woojin smirked when he saw this.</span></p><p><span style="">[You last words are really corny.] </span></p><p><span style="">Dread. </span></p><p><span style="">His eight tentacles were standing on top of a field of corpses. &#xA0;What did that mean?</span></p><p><span style="">Will it be able to handle the power being emitted by the several thousand corpses?</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin had filled himself with magic as he waited for Dread to show up, and he released all of his magic at once.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Corpse Explosion.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">All the magic drained out of Woojin&apos;s body.</span></p>
