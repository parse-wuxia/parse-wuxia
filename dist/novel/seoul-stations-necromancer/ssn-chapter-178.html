The oracle or whatever is annoying, but it seems to be &#xA0;legitimate.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;....&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin used his will to contact Do-jaemin, who was his Domain&apos;s vassal.</span></p><p><span style="">[What are you doing?]</span></p><p><span style="">[Hyunnnnnnng!]</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin was greeted so fiercely that he could easily guess that Jaemin need something from him.</span></p><p><span style="">[Do your best to hold out. &#xA0;I&apos;ll be there quickly.]</span></p><p><span style="">[Yes, we&apos;ll protect this Colony no matter what.]</span></p><p><span style="">He had one Dungeon and one Colony.</span></p><p><span style="">He only had two gates, but it seemed the nearby Dimensional lords seemed hellbent at attacking him. &#xA0;The Dimensional lords were pooling their strength together, and they were gathering enough forces to finish this deed on its first try.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I&apos;ll have to return quickly.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Is the situation really that bad?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I&apos;ve been told around 100,000 monsters have gathered at the Nero plateau.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;How can that be...&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Is it close to the Saurus mountain?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;It would take the land monsters about a week to travel that distance.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;One week...&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">He had to get there before the week ended. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">How could the Coalition stop an army of 100,000 monsters by themselves? &#xA0;Moreover, it was obvious that the Dimensional lords would take part in the fight.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;We have to fly back.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin got on Shing Shing.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;What are you doing?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin extended his hand towards her. &#xA0;He was just standing there blankly. &#xA0;She grabbed his hand in a moment of bewilderment, and she got on behind him.</span></p><p><span style="">Poo-roo-roohk.</span></p><p><span style="">The icky Holy Power could be felt through her butt, so Shing Shing neighed. &#xA0;However, it was able to be easily ignored.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Hold on tight. &#xA0;If you fall off, I&apos;m leaving you behind.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Yes.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">He didn&apos;t have to say it like that... &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">However, she knew his words weren&apos;t an empty threat, so she clung tightly to Woojin&apos;s waist.</span></p><p><span style="">Shwahhhk.</span></p><p><span style="">The Phantom Steed stepped onto the empty air, and it started galloping through the sky.</span></p><p><span style="">****</span></p><p><span style="">Tauric had climbed a watchtower, and he worriedly looked out into the setting sun.</span></p><p><span style="">Hwah-roo-roohk.</span></p><p><span style="">A fireball fell from the sky, and it landed lightly on top of the watchtower. &#xA0;The flame resolved into the shape of a man.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Oh, Fire Spirit King.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Ah. &#xA0;I&apos;m not a Spirit.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;But...&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Ah, whatever. &#xA0;So how&apos;s everything going?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Somehow, Sunggoo felt as if he was being mocked, so he frowned. &#xA0;He quickly brought up his business.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Can you see them?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Mmm. &#xA0;Their numbers keep increasing, but they haven&apos;t shown any signs of moving yet.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">It wasn&apos;t as if the monsters were showing up from some capital on this planet. &#xA0;They were coming from the Dimensional lords&apos; colonies. &#xA0;They were using their Points to bolster their forces.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;When do you think they&apos;ll move?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Since I&apos;m not the god of prophecy, I wouldn&#x2019;t know such information.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Hmm. &#xA0;I hope they don&apos;t move towards us until hyung-nim arrives.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Tauric agreed wholeheartedly at Sunggoo&apos;s mumbled words.</span></p><p><span style="">How great would it be if thing turned out that way?</span></p><p><span style="">Tauric wasn&apos;t confident that they could take on such a massive number of troops.</span></p><p><span style="">Currently, if one excluded children and the wounded, their own forces numbered in the 3,000. &#xA0;It was a small number.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Just let me know when they start to move.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Tauric was curious as to why the Fire Spirit from earth kept bringing up this topic.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;If they start to move, we have about a week before they reach us.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">This was also the time frame given by the Immortal regarding his return.</span></p><p><span style="">This was why Tauric and the people of the fortress held out hope.</span></p><p><span style="">If they could keep out the vanguard, they believed the Immortal would take care of the rest.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;You never know what will happen. &#xA0;If they start to move, I might have to delay their progress.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">A massive army, which numbered in the 100,000, was going to march towards them, yet he wanted to delay them by himself?</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;...aren&apos;t you afraid?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;If I screw up here, I won&apos;t be able to return home. &#xA0;I&apos;m more afraid of that possibility.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;...&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">If Tauric thought about it, this being was from earth.</span></p><p><span style="">Even now he could use the Portal to run away to earth, yet he was still fighting for Alphen.</span></p><p><span style="">Tauric face was full of emotion as he bowed his head.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I want to give my deepest gratitude for the Fire Spirit King&apos;s courage and favor.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Jeez. &#xA0;You don&apos;t have to thank me.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Sunggoo tried to wave it away with his hands. </span></p><p><span style="">Didn&apos;t everyone had their own motivation for fighting here?</span></p><p><span style="">These beings were fighting for Alphen&apos;s survival and salvation. &#xA0;Sunggoo was fighting for the chance to return to his home.</span></p><p><span style="">Currently, the gate in front of the portal was unusable, since the owner of the Colony wasn&apos;t present.</span></p><p><span style="">If Woojin had designated someone to be in charge of the Colony&apos;s defense, this person would have been able to use the Points and Gate freely....</span></p><p><span style="">However, there would be nothing to be gained by regretting past decisions. &#xA0;The only thing he could do was to pray for Woojin&apos;s swift return.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Ah. &#xA0;It seems king Raul is looking for the Fire Spirit King. &#xA0;You should go meet him.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Hmm. &#xA0;Is that so?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Sunggoo was curious as to why the king of the Dwarves was looking for him.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Please alert me immediately when you see them move.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Yes. I&apos;ll do so.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">The worshippers of Skia, the god of Adventurers, were scouting the enemy. &#xA0;Therefore, they&apos;ll know the exact moment when the army starts to move.</span></p><p><span style="">Hwah-roo-roohk.</span></p><p><span style="">A haze emanated from Sunggoo&apos;s body before he ignited.</span></p><p><span style="">Accompanying the scorching heat, he flew from the watchtower to one of the walls.</span></p><p><span style="">Several short dwarves were gathered to check on the defense weapons mounted on the castle walls. &#xA0;These were magical weapons, which could be activated using Bloodstones. &#xA0;There were also several primitive looking weapons placed on the walls too.</span></p><p><span style="">It didn&apos;t matter if it was cold water or dirty water. &#xA0;Every weapon they had was being deployed.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;You were looking for me, Raul?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Oh oh. &#xA0;Earth&apos;s Spirit King.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;...&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Did he have to accept the name now?</span></p><p><span style="">Sunggoo ignored Raul&#x2019;s words as he asked a question.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;What business do you have with me?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I&apos;ve found an interesting Item. &#xA0;I thought it might be very compatible with the Spirit King.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;What is it?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Let&apos;s go together.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">He was led away by Raul. &#xA0;From the castle wall, they climbed to a clearing at the mid-slope of the mountain.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;This is where the research facility of the magicians is located at.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">When Woojin was constructing the fortress, he had built several types of building including the research facility.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I had an interesting Item, and since the earth&apos;s Spirit King deals with the source of fire, I remodeled it to fit you.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Raul was proud of his research room, and he pointed towards the round cylinder in front of the room.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Hmm. &#xA0;What is this?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;It is a magic amplifier. &#xA0;When I was making it, I made it so that it&apos;ll grow one&apos;s magical energy. &#xA0;If you stand within it and shoot your amplified magic, it&apos;ll become a splendid weapon.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Ho-oh.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Sunggoo got up on the round platform.</span></p><p><span style="">Weeeeng.</span></p><p><span style="">The entire platform was engraved with complicated magic circle. &#xA0;It let out a light, and it made Sunggoo feel a profound and mysterious sensation. When he touched the crystal ball in front of him, the round cylinder was pointed frontward like a cannon.</span></p><p><span style="">The cylinder had a hole where a single person would be able to fit through, and it was also engraved with various magical circles.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;How much can it amplify my magic?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">As Sunggoo asked his question, he discreetly pushed his magic into it.</span></p><p><span style="">Hwa-roo-roohk!</span></p><p><span style="">A small amount of energy had gone out of him into the crystal ball, and it traveled through the tube. An unexpected result occurred.</span></p><p><span style="">Koo-ooh-ooh-oohng!</span></p><p><span style="">Accompanying a large explosions, a flame rose high into the sky as it left behind a trail of fire. &#xA0;Sunggoo, who was surprised, took his hands off the crystal ball, and he looked at Raul with a dumbfounded expression.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Doo-hahah. No race can hold a candle against the magical engineering of the Dwarves. &#xA0;To be precise, it&apos;ll amplify your power by 9 times.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;How many times did you say?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I said 9 times.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Raul proudly unfurled nine fingers. &#xA0;Sunggoo looked at the amplifier with a pale face.</span></p><p><span style="">&apos;This is quite the Item.&apos;</span></p><p><span style="">The durability of the Item was a problem, but if one considered only the power it could generate, it was an incredible weapon. &#xA0;It felt as if he had gained a much needed item. &#xA0;The only downside was the fact that this was a fixed defensive weapon.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Could you make this a bit smaller so I can carry it around?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;You are talking about a portable amplifier? &#xA0;Do you mean a magician&apos;s staff?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Ah....&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">The magicians carried around a staff, because it acted as an amplifier for their magic?</span></p><p><span style="">When Sunggoo nodded his head, Dwarf King Raul shook his head from side to side.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;You can&apos;t get such results with a staff. &#xA0;It merely amplifies one&apos;s magic by three fold.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;....&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Did his ears hear wrong? &#xA0;Three times?</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Did you say three times?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;That&apos;s right. &#xA0;A staff can&apos;t generate a power of this magnitude.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I don&apos;t mind it. &#xA0;May you make me one?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Mmmm? &#xA0;If we had enough ingredients....&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Raul smirked at Sunggoo&apos;s shining eyes. &#xA0;How could a magician not even know about the existence of a staff?</span></p><p><span style="">Was it because he was a Spirit?</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I&apos;ll gather the materials from the other heroes, and I&apos;ll make you one.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">At Raul&apos;s words, Sunggoo&apos;s face became flushed from the anticipation.</span></p><p><span style="">If he had this Item, it felt as if he would be able to hold out against the enemies until Woojin came back.</span></p><p><span style="">***</span></p><p><span style="">Shing Shing had been running through the sky, and it came to a stop.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;....&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;....&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Neither Woojin nor Melody was able to speak when they saw the sight in front of them.</span></p><p><span style="">Kee-ah-ahh.</span></p><p><span style="">The sky was filled with dragonfly-looking monsters, and the ground was filled with ground type monsters.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;When they said an army of 100,000 had gathered, did they mean here?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin was dumbfounded as he looked at the monster army in front of him. &#xA0;There was so many of them that it was meaningless to count them.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;So they want to block my way back?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">It was either his enemies trying to delay his return to his Colony, or they thought the massive amount of monsters would be able to take him down. &#xA0;Either way it was an unpleasant situation.</span></p><p><span style="">This was especially true, since he was in a hurry.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Open a path, Jaenis.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">[Who dares to stand in front of our lord! &#xA0;Who?]</span></p><p><span style="">Koo-ah-ahng! </span></p><p><span style="">The summoned Jaenis let out his flame. &#xA0;It shot into the front line, and several hundred dragonfly monsters were burnt to crisp. &#xA0;Shing Shing ran through the newly opened path.</span></p><p><span style="">However, it didn&apos;t take long for the monsters to get in front of his path again.</span></p><p><span style="">Shoo-shoo-shoohk!</span></p><p><span style="">The interference occurred not only in the sky.</span></p><p><span style="">The monsters on the surface shot poisoned darts or magical spells. &#xA0;They were doing various acts to bother Woojin.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Ah. &#xA0;They are being annoying.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">If he wanted to smash through this, it might be better to do it on the ground. &#xA0;There were too many enemies for Woojin to handle by himself. &#xA0;Moreover, Melody was riding behind him, and it was complicating the use of his power.</span></p><p><span style="">The Holy Power of Melody and Woojin&apos;s Necromancy were at odds with each other. &#xA0;They reduced the effectiveness of each other&apos;s power.</span></p><p><span style="">If he wanted to cut open a path through slaughter, he would be better off going forward with his Familiars.</span></p><p><span style="">When Shing Shing landed, the monsters in the surrounding tried to mob him.</span></p><p><span style="">Kwahng!</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin detonated the souls hovering around him as he pushed back the monsters. &#xA0;The Immortal summoned his Familiars in the clearing.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;My dudes!&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">At their master&apos;s calling, every Death Knight except Kiba, who was protecting the Dimensional domain, appeared.</span></p><p><span style="">[Koo-hoo-oohp. &#xA0;It is the smell of the battlefield.]</span></p><p><span style="">[What do you want us to do?]</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin took out his Warrior&apos;s Weapon, and he pointed forward.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;We are going straight towards the Saurus Colony.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">[It is a battle!]</span></p><p><span style="">[I&apos;ll bring down the blessing of death!]</span></p><p><span style="">The Death Knights charged forward like mad men, and the monsters crowding them were cut down helplessly.</span></p><p><span style="">Did they really think such small fries could stop the Immortal&apos;s advance?</span></p><p><span style="">It would delay him a little bit, but on the other hand, he would also gain something from this encounter.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;You can do whatever the hell &#xA0;you want, Jaenis.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">[I like that command.]</span></p><p><span style="">Jaenis didn&apos;t need to worry about friendly fire, so he indiscriminately used his magic against the monsters. &#xA0;As the monsters started to burn, his EXP started to climb steadily .</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;L...look over there! &#xA0;It is one of Trahnet&apos;s commander.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Melody yelled out in dismay when she saw the familiar flag. Woojin turned to look up into the sky. &#xA0;The large stingray monster Feris was flying in the sky, and there was a familiar symbol drawn on the belly of the beast.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Isn&apos;t that Ilrak? &#xA0;The 44th Throne..&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin&apos;s face turned serious.</span></p><p><span style="">He had always referred to them in terms of them being Trahnet&apos;s subordinates and commanders. &#xA0;However, it felt different now.</span></p><p><span style="">This being was considered to be a god in 44 different Dimension.</span></p><p><span style="">Now the Dimensional lord was here on Alphen for a Code that&apos;ll make him qualified to be a god in 45 Dimensions.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;What...&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">One could describe this as being amazing. This noble personage was special and holy.</span></p><p><span style="">However, it was funny to Woojin.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;...utter nonsense.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">These divine beings were allying themselves to each other to bring him down.</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin could feel their fear.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;It is up to you to follow me, Melody.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin put Melody on the ground, and he gripped the reins.</span></p><p><span style="">Poo-roo-roohk!</span></p><p><span style="">Shin Shing blew out air from its mouth as it galloped into the sky. &#xA0;It headed towards Ilrak&apos;s Feris.</span></p>
