<p>Chapter 204 - The Boundary between Reality and Virtual Reality (2)</p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Captain. &#xA0;The Neutralization System is ready to be activated.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What about Earth&#x2019;s Code?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;The order has been given, and we&#x2019;ll recover Kim-kahngchul in 5 minutes.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;All right. &#xA0;Let&#x2019;s go in.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Ten minutes.</span></p><p><span style="">They had to take out Kahng-woojin first. &#xA0;Then they will take out Kim-kahngchul.</span></p><p><span style="">The mess caused in the world would be cleanly reverted, and everything will start over once again.</span></p><p><span style="">Captain Leone led his subordinates down the stairs of the Seoul Station.</span></p><p><span style="">***</span></p><p><span style="">Lee-soogyong hid Sooah behind her, and she spoke in a trembling voice.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;P...please step back.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;It&#x2019;ll be alright. &#xA0;This will take only an instant.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Kim-kahngchul stepped forward with a blank expression on his face. &#xA0;He was doing what needed to be done.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I won&#x2019;t let you, you bastard!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">She hadn&#x2019;t been threatened, but she could tell what he was about to do. &#xA0;She acted on her maternal instinct. &#xA0;She tried to protect her child.</span></p><p><span style="">Lee-soogyong wrapped herself around Kim-kahngchul</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Run away, Sooah!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Mom!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hurry!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">At Lee-soogyong&#x2019;s cry, Sooah hesitatingly ran towards the exit. &#xA0;On the other side of the door, the security guards were fallen all over the floor.</span></p><p><span style="">How could regular people hold back a Rank A Roused?</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ah-ahk!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Kim-kahngchul easily pushed Lee-soogyong away. &#xA0;She screamed as she fell to the floor.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;You won&#x2019;t remember this anyway.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Their fate would repeat again. &#xA0;He would no longer exist in this world, and she wouldn&#x2019;t remember what had happened.</span></p><p><span style="">The sins he was committing right now would be wiped away.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Chet.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The delay was for a brief moment, but it was enough time for Sooah to sneak out through the door.</span></p><p><span style="">Kim-kahngchul quickly exited the room, and he came to a stop immediately. &#xA0;Cindy and Do-jiwon had been coming towards this very room. &#xA0;Moreover, one could see Sooah hiding behind them.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Who are you?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Isn&#x2019;t he Kim-kahngchul?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Two slim beauties chatted to each other, and Kim-kahngchul&#x2019;s expression hardened.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What happened to the people here? &#xA0;Did you do this?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What&#x2019;s going on?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">They tried to argue from a moral high ground, but the women were afraid.</span></p><p><span style="">They had come here to play without knowing what was going on. &#xA0;They arrived to find the security guards on the floor, and Sooah was being chased by a man. &#xA0;This particular man had been known as the greatest Roused of Korea, and he had been imprisoned in an isolation room. &#xA0;They faced him.</span></p><p><span style="">By any account, this was a suspicious and scary situation.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Tsk.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Kim-kahngchul ran forward. &#xA0;The promised time was close at hand. &#xA0;If he wanted to be saved from this false world, he needed to get the Code.</span></p><p><span style="">Large tears could be seen in the eyes of the child.</span></p><p><span style="">Paht.</span></p><p><span style="">Kim-kahngchul held a small awl in his hand. &#xA0;It was more than enough to snuff out this small life.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ah-ah-ahk!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Kim-kahngchul charged forward like an angry bull. &#xA0;Do-jiwon and Cindy screamed. &#xA0;This was the only way they could fight back.</span></p><p><span style="">Hwah-roo-roohk.</span></p><p><span style="">Their screams saved them.</span></p><p><span style="">Hwah-ahk!</span></p><p><span style="">Cindy squinted from the heat as she looked at the flame in front of her. &#xA0;She had thought Kim-kahngchul was on fire, but after opening her eyes further, Kim-kahngchul was fighting with a ball of fire.</span></p><p><span style="">Hwah-roo-roohk&#xFF0C;puhk!</span></p><p><span style="">The ball of fire was swinging its arms and leg. &#xA0;She started to see a form take shape.</span></p><p><span style="">It was a man wearing red clothes, which looked like Korean traditional robes.</span></p><p><span style="">He possessed white skin, and his hair, eyebrows and pupils were red. &#xA0;He was a handsome man with a distinctive look.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Move. &#xA0;I&#x2019;m trying to save the world.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;No way.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">It was inappropriate for this situation, but the red haired man let out a light laugh. &#xA0;No matter how one looked at this situation, Kim-kahngchul was attacking three defenseless women. &#xA0;His actions was far from saving the world.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I don&#x2019;t have much time left&#xFF01;&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The red-haired man&#x2019;s smile made Kim-kahngchul feel much more desperate.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;You should stop this.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Get out of the way!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Unlike the desperate Kim-kahngchul, the other man acted as if he had all the time in the world.</span></p><p><span style="">The Roused in front of him was a Fire Element Roused, who was easily able to turn aside a Rank A Roused like him.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;This won&#x2019;t do.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Hwah-roo-roohk.</span></p><p><span style="">The man&#x2019;s hands shimmered as if it was about to melt before it ignited. &#xA0;The flames reached out towards Kim-kahngchul. &#xA0;&#xA0;The bands of fire wrapped around Kim-kahngchul, and all his movements were restricted. &#xA0;He fell to the floor.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Eeeek.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Kim-kahngchul struggled on the floor, but he didn&#x2019;t show any signs of giving up. &#xA0;He pursed his lips, and in a flash, a shiny needle flew towards Sooah&#x2019;s head.</span></p><p><span style="">Poo-shoohk.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;How dare you?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Hwah-roohk!</span></p><p><span style="">A wall of flame appeared in front of Sooah.</span></p><p><span style="">Before the needle could reach its target, it melted from the heat.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hmm. &#xA0;Should I burn you or not?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Currently, the loops of flame was just restricting Kim-kahngchul.</span></p><p><span style="">Kim-kahngchul, who was tied up, just felt a warm sensation from the flame. &#xA0;However, if the temperament of the flame was changed a little bit, the bands of flame could turn Kim-kahngchul into ashes.</span></p><p><span style="">However, the man didn&#x2019;t have to worry about what to do.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ah. &#xA0;Not yet!&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Suddenly, Kim-kahngchul shivered as he started to struggle.</span></p><p><span style="">His body slowly started to turn gray, and he disappeared as if he had never existed in this world.</span></p><p><span style="">The man had seen this numerous times before where beings disappeared without leaving behind a corpse.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Uh? &#xA0;He was a Dimensional lord?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">He tilted his head in confusion. &#xA0;Do-jiwon and Cindy approached him, and they bowed towards him.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;T...thank you.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">It had already been several weeks, since they had moved to Alandal. &#xA0;They knew most of the well-known Roused, yet this was the first time they saw this man in front of them.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Eh-ee, sister-in-law. &#xA0;It&#x2019;s me.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">When Do-jiwon and Cindy became surprised, the handsome man with the red hair grinned.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;It&#x2019;s me, Sunggoo. &#xA0;I&#x2019;m Sunggoo.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">He had won against the Curse of the Dragon&#x2019;s Breath. &#xA0;He was born again as a Dragon Human hybrid. &#xA0;He was the Flame Man Hong-sunggoo.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;N...no way.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Huhk&#xFF01;&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Dojinwon and Cindy shook their head as if they couldn&#x2019;t believe it.</span></p><p><span style="">Sunggoo was never this handsome&#x2026;.</span></p><p><span style="">***</span></p><p><span style="">Seoul Station.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hurry&#xFF01;&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">At Captain Leone&#x2019;s insistence, the party members quickened their steps. &#xA0;They relied on the light attached to the magnetic levitation cart as they ran down the dark tunnel.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;We are almost at our target.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">They were inside subway station building.</span></p><p><span style="">There were a long line of capsules interconnected to each other. &#xA0;Each capsule was labeled with numbers.</span></p><p><span style="">They were looking for a specific one.</span></p><p><span style="">G-529.</span></p><p><span style="">Leone gave the order when he saw the asian features of the man within the capsule.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Start opening the hatch.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes, sir.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The party members placed equipments that will open the capsule.</span></p><p><span style="">Weeeeeng!</span></p><p><span style="">They had done this numerous times, so their actions were in sync. &#xA0;In a flash, they had unlocked all the clasps that kept the capsule sealed.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Open it.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Poo-shoohng. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">Chweeeek.</span></p><p><span style="">The air escaped, and a nude figure of a man could be seen. &#xA0;There were hoses placed in the man&#x2019;s mouth and ears. &#xA0;There were devices attached to the head, heart and other body parts. &#xA0;It looked as if the man was stuck inside a spider&#x2019;s web, and it looked creepy.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Get him out of there.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes, sir!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The connecting equipments were being pulled off, and the man had to be put on the cart. &#xA0;They just had to take him out now.</span></p><p><span style="">At this point, they had spent only 3 minute and 30 seconds.</span></p><p><span style="">Pah-jee-jee-jeek!</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ah-ahk!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">A party member fell backwards when one of the equipment let out a spark.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What&#x2019;s wrong?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I...I&#x2019;m not sure.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Just sever it with the cutter!&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">If they couldn&#x2019;t pull it off with their hands, they would just cut the man free.</span></p><p><span style="">However&#x2026;.</span></p><p><span style="">Pah-jee-jeek!</span></p><p><span style="">However, party member&#x2019;s body shook from being electrocuted. &#xA0;The electric shock was transferred when the cutter touched some unknown barrier made out of electricity.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ooh-uh-uh-uh&#xFF01;&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Shit!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Leone ran forward, and he was able to pull away his subordinate. &#xA0;The subordinate had already lost consciousness.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What the hell is going on!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Captain Leone had rescued several dozen people before. &#xA0;This situation was a first, so he was confused by the situation.</span></p><p><span style="">Chee-chee-chee-jeek.</span></p><p><span style="">He wasn&#x2019;t sure if the smoke originated from the electric current, but it lingered around the nude man&#x2019;s body.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Was there some kind of powerful lock placed on him?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">He had always brought out Iello before. &#xA0;This was the first time he would be bringing Kahng-woojin into reality.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Captain. &#xA0;We don&#x2019;t have much time left.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Shit!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Since he didn&#x2019;t have a solution, it would be a waste of time to stand around here. &#xA0;Moreover, two of the party members was unconscious.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Put everyone on the cart. &#xA0;We&#x2019;ll save Kim-kahngchul first.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes, sir!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The rest of the party gathered the two party members on the cart, and they hurriedly went towards Kim-kahngchul&#x2019;s capsule.</span></p><p><span style="">*** </span></p><p><span style="">Darkness.</span></p><p><span style="">In truth, it was impossible to tell if it was bright or dark outside. &#xA0;A small light appeared in the emptiness.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Ah.&apos;</span></p><p><span style="">The light registered at the same time as the darkness. &#xA0;Then&#x2026;.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ooh-ehhhhk!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">He couldn&#x2019;t fight the queasiness, so he emptied the content of his stomach.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;We have to move him. &#xA0;We don&#x2019;t have much time left.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">At Leone&#x2019;s words, the awakened Kim-kahngchul cracked open his eyes to look at his surrounding. &#xA0;The party members picked him up, and he was put on the cart. &#xA0;When he looked up at the ceiling from a prone position, the ceiling looked familiar.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Subway station.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">Was this the Moon World?</span></p><p><span style="">Or was this the real earth?</span></p><p><span style="">The fake&#x2026; Did he finally shed the bonds of illusion?</span></p><p><span style="">Kim-kahngchul closed his eyes.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;I was saved.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">He felt relief, and at the same time, he remembered something he had forgotten. &#xA0;His eyes opened wide as he spoke.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Earth&#x2026; Code&#x2026; I&#x2019;ve failed in acquiring&#x2026;it.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Leone stood still for a brief moment, and his face crumpled.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Shit. &#xA0;Let&#x2019;s get out of here first.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">They had to get out of here within the 10 &#xA0;minute time frame. &#xA0;If not, the Guardians would resume their activities. &#xA0;The party members quickly walked out of there.</span></p><p><span style="">*** </span></p><p><span style="">Flying Fortress Bibi&#x2019;s Castle.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Whew. &#xA0;That was a close call.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Jung-minchan and the other members arrived late. &#xA0;All they could do was to console Sooah and the battered Lee-soogyong.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;There&#x2019;s nothing I can say to make up for this, but I&#x2019;m very sorry.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">This wasn&#x2019;t an outsider, who broke in. &#xA0;Kim-kahngchul was someone they had locked away, and his surprise attack had almost resulted in a disaster.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;So where&#x2019;s hyung-nim?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Mmmm.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">At Sunggoo&#x2019;s question, Jung-minchan groaned. &#xA0;Hong-sunggoo had changed too much. &#xA0;If it wasn&#x2019;t for his unrefined way of talking, Jung-minchan would have mistaken him for someone else. &#xA0;The atmosphere around him had completely changed.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;He said he had something he wanted to check out the Moon World, so he went there.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Which Dimension is that in?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;That is&#x2026;.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">After he hesitated for a moment, Jung-minchan spilled everything he heard from Woojin. &#xA0;Sunggoo listened tcalmly, and he didn&#x2019;t show any signs of being surprised as he replied.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;So we just have to protect little miss Sooah until hyung-nim comes back.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">It wasn&#x2019;t just his appearance that had changed. &#xA0;He turned more simple-minded.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ah, yes. &#xA0;That is true, but&#x2026;.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Jung-minchan had been taken aback by Kim-kahngchul&#x2019;s surprise attack, but he now remembered the problem that was almost at their front door.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;A really powerful Dimensional lord is coming straight towards our fortress. &#xA0;His target is probably&#x2026;.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Even if Minchan didn&#x2019;t tell him, he could guess.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I&#x2019;ll go welcome him.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">When did Sunggoo become such a reliable man?</span></p><p><span style="">When confronted by Sunggoo&#x2019;s confidence, Jung-michan gave a different opinion.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;How about we move the fortress to avoid the fight?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Eh-ee. &#xA0;We can run away after we attempt the fight.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">He wasn&#x2019;t reliable. &#xA0;He might be reckless...</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ah. &#xA0;Ms. Haesol will be back soon. &#xA0;Ms. Bibi.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Speak.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Heh heh. &#xA0;I&#x2019;m not used to you now that you are all grown up.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">She had grown in terms of height, and she had developed exceptionally in some places. &#xA0;Sunggoo laughed awkwardly as he looked at Bibi.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ms. Haesol is bringing back friends, so may we move the fortress to the sea?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I can.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Then please do so. &#xA0;I&#x2019;ll warm up by searching nearby for a fight.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">After arriving on deck, Sunggoo&#x2019;s entire body turned red, and he jumped into the air.</span></p><p><span style="">He looked like a phoenix in flight, so the people of Alandal was mesmerized by the sight.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;We&#x2019;ll head towards Incheon.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Most of the population had left Seoul already. &#xA0;The nearest body of water was the western sea.</span></p><p><span style="">Bibi&#x2019;s Castle moved towards that direction.</span></p><p><span style="">Afterwards, the Phantom Unit led by Blanka was assigned to protect Sooah. &#xA0;Dimensional lords might pull off a surprise attack, so the Undead army, Ratick tribe, Wyvern unit and the Fortress&#x2019;s defense system was put on alert.</span></p><p><span style="">The non-combat personnels went below deck, and they headed towards the evacuation shelter. &#xA0;&#xA0;After Bibi&#x2019;s Castle was put on emergency alert, they arrived over the western sea.</span></p><p><span style="">Zwahhhng.</span></p><p><span style="">The portal shimmered, and Che-haesol appeared.</span></p><p><span style="">Minchan fiercely greeted her.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ms. Haesol!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I&#x2019;m sorry for being late.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;No, I can relax now that commander Haesol is back. &#xA0;Please take command of our Units.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">He was only the Prime Minister. &#xA0;&#xA0;Che-haesol used to be a commissioned officer, so she was more qualified to command the battle. &#xA0;Moreover, she was a talent, who possessed Telepathic ability over groups.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ah. &#xA0;Anyways, my friends...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes. &#xA0;I guess our allies from Alphen is coming. &#xA0;How fortunate&#x2026;.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Jung-minchan&#x2019;s mouth fell open as he looked at the being that came out of the shimmering portal.</span></p><p><span style="">Shwahhhhk!</span></p><p><span style="">The portal became larger as if it was about rip apart. &#xA0;A body kept emerging from the portal as it climbed into the sky.</span></p><p><span style="">Koo-oh-oh-oh-oh!</span></p><p><span style="">After letting out a roar, the long body circled the the Flying Fortress before it jumped into the sea.</span></p><p><span style="">It looked a bit different from the traditional Dragons. &#xA0;Instead, it looked like the Eastern Dragons from the legends.</span></p><p><span style="">Koo-oh-oh-oh-oh!</span></p><p><span style="">The problem was the fact that it wasn&#x2019;t just one of them. &#xA0;Seventeen Dragons had appeared.</span></p><p><span style="">On top of the deck&#x2026;.</span></p><p><span style="">The combat personnel assigned above deck...</span></p><p><span style="">The Ratick tribe, who was on standby with the Wyverns, were surprised.</span></p><p><span style="">Death Knights, who were the core force of Undead army also&#x2026;.</span></p><p><span style="">[How surprising.]</span></p><p><span style="">Even Lich Jaenis, who had protected Alphen for the past 200 years&#x2026;.</span></p><p><span style="">[Those are Water Dragons&#x2026;.]</span></p><p><span style="">These were the last Dragons of Alphen&#x2026;. &#xA0;All the hardship she went through drained out of her, and Haesol let out a weak laugh.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I made new friends.&#x201D;</span></p>
