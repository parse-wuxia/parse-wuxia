<p><span style="">Chapter 143 - Colonies</span></p><p><span style="">The Colosseum was seized.</span></p><p><span style="">Several dozen Dungeons broke nearby, and the monsters gathered around the Colosseum. &#xA0;It was a very important historical site, so the government hesitated in sending in their armed forces. &#xA0;They wanted to protect the site.</span></p><p><span style="">Roused subjugation teams were formed, and they carried out mission to lure and annihilate the monsters. &#xA0;The plan worked pretty well.</span></p><p><span style="">Whatever plan they carried out they had to do it before the colony was completed. &#xA0;After a day, </span></p><p><span style="">the large tree that had grown inside the Colosseum started letting out a light. &#xA0;Until that point, the monsters had been calm as if they were gathered for a reunion. &#xA0;Afterwards, the monsters simultaneously ran amok. </span></p><p><span style="">No, it was closer to a march.</span></p><p><span style="">The city was destroyed, and the army retreated. &#xA0;The Colosseum became a foothold, and the only remnant of humans were their corpses.</span></p><p><span style="">Doo doo doo doo! Tee-tee-teeng! </span></p><p><span style="">It was a fierce battlefield where machine guns were firing relentlessly towards the charging monsters.</span></p><p><span style="">Kwahhhhh! </span></p><p><span style="">The enormous monster&apos;s ogre leather was so hard that bullets couldn&apos;t penetrate it.</span></p><p><span style="">Koong, koong! </span></p><p><span style="">The ogre took big strides as it ran. &#xA0;It was about to reach the camp.</span></p><p><span style="">Kwahhhng! </span></p><p><span style="">Rocket launchers simultaneously launched their projectiles, and the rockets hit the target. Chunks of flesh was ripped away from various parts of the body, but as it was falling down from its charge, it threw its club.</span></p><p><span style="">The enormous club flew through the air towards a window that had been continuously raining down bullets towards the ogre.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Koo-ahk!&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Fabio!&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">The soldier using the machine gun was immediately snuffed out, and Fabio, who had been off to the side, barely hung onto his life. &#xA0;The club had ripped off one of his arm, and he wasn&apos;t in a good state.</span></p><p><span style="">He had taken a blow to the head too, so his head was soaked with blood. &#xA0;If left alone, he would die from excessive bleeding.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Let&apos;s go down. &#xA0;Stay with me a little longer.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ooh-ooh-oohk.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Antonio supported Fabio down the stairs. The advance of the monsters were endless. &#xA0;They didn&apos;t show any signs of decreasing in number no matter how many were killed.</span></p><p><span style="">This battle had been continuing for the 5th day. &#xA0;The entire city of Rome was lost. &#xA0;There weren&apos;t even an official count on how many civilians and soldiers had died.</span></p><p><span style="">The monsters continued to march forward, and the humans kept retreating. &#xA0;Their territory was getting larger.</span></p><p><span style="">After exiting the building, Antonio searched for the medics located in the rear.</span></p><p><span style="">The place was filled with soldiers injured by the monsters.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ooh ooh. &#xA0;Hurry up and heal me.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ooh-ahhk! Help me.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">The final order came down amongst the screams of pain.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Load up the injured! We are retreating.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Since the retreat order was given, the explosives placed along the last battle line would explode in 5 minutes.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Stay with me a little longer, Fabio.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ooh ooh ooh.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">There was no space to lie down inside the truck. &#xA0;The medic sitting on the bench quickly wrapped bandages around him in an attempt to stem the bleeding.</span></p><p><span style="">However, his friend&apos;s eyes were fluttering as it closed. &#xA0;It seemed he was almost at death&apos;s door, and this would be Antonio&apos;s final goodbye with his friend.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Shit!&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Antonio let out a curse as he grabbed his gun.</span></p><p><span style="">He&apos;ll get his revenge for his comrade! </span></p><p><span style="">We wanted to shove bullets into the monsters up until the end.</span></p><p><span style="">Too-doo-doo! Doo-doo-doo! </span></p><p><span style="">The soldiers gave a final covering fire as the troops started to retreated.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Antonio! Hurry up and get in.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">A vehicle with a machine gun mounted on the roof stopped next to him. &#xA0;Antonio got on the vehicle, and they quickly retreated. &#xA0;He spoke to the soldier operating the machine gun.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;We have 4 minutes left.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Explosives were planted in various locations. &#xA0;It&apos;ll deal a bug blow to the advancing monsters. &#xA0;They had to get far as possible before the explosives went off.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Shit.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">The territory held by active monsters was slowly expanding. </span></p><p><span style="">Since the monsters moved under orders, they weren&apos;t wild animals. They were basically an alien army.</span></p><p><span style="">This wasn&apos;t a monster hunt anymore. &#xA0;This was the start of war between the monsters and humans.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;We have to catch the Monster Lords.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Monster Lords. </span></p><p><span style="">These were beings on a higher level than the Dungeon&apos;s Boss Monsters.</span></p><p><span style="">These beings were shrouded in veil, and not much was known about them. &#xA0;They brought a sense of danger that rivaled the Dungeon Shock.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Anyways, reinforcement is coming from Korea.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">This was the first time Antonio had heard of this news, so he turned to look at his comrade. The other man&apos;s face was filled with hope. It was a bizarre sight to see since the human army was retreating, and they had to continuously cede their battle lines.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Where&apos;s Korea located at?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Antonio was unfamiliar with the country called Korea. This was the first time he heard about them.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;To be precise, Kahng-woojin is coming here. &#xA0;I&apos;m talking about the King of Alandal.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Antonio was very ignorant about current affairs, but even he knew about Alandal. &#xA0;His eyes widened.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;The messiah of the Middle East!&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Everyone in the world knew about his war on terror in the Middle East. This was especially true for soldiers, and he had been a significant area of interest for Antonio. &#xA0;He was more knowledgeable about the situation than most civilians.</span></p><p><span style="">Ggeeeeeek! </span></p><p><span style="">The vehicle came to a rough stop, and the people rolled around in the back.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Shit! What the hell?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Oh shit. Monsters!&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Get ready to fire!&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Airborne monsters had suddenly appeared in the air. The barricades on the ground had momentarily stalled the ground-bound monsters. This was when the monsters started to attack from the sky.</span></p><p><span style="">The evacuating vehicles stopped, and the soldiers readied themselves to fire thier weapons. </span></p><p><span style="">However, someone else shot down the monsters before they could.</span></p><p><span style="">Hwah-roo-roohk! Puh-puh-puhng! </span></p><p><span style="">Several dozen magic spells flew into the air as it shot down the monsters.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Is it a Roused unit?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I...I think he is here.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Antonio got off the vehicle as he mumbled to himself. &#xA0;It looked as if he had been mesmerized.</span></p><p><span style="">It was happening not too far away. &#xA0;It was as if consecutive rockets were detonating. The monsters couldn&apos;t resist against the magic spells that flew into the air. &#xA0;They either crashed to the floor, or they flew back from where they came from.</span></p><p><span style="">Heeeeeeng. </span></p><p><span style="">A Phantom Steed was racing across the road.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Oh my god!&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Antonio was in disbelief. &#xA0;He clenched his fists.</span></p><p><span style="">It was Kahng-woojin. He never expected to meet Kahng-woojin during his lifetime! </span></p><p><span style="">Woojin stopped in front of the vehicles, and he let off the woman riding behind him.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Heal them. I&apos;m leaving immediately.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Please be careful.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Woojin smirked when he heard the Holy Maiden&apos;s farewell. &#xA0;He would have never thought he would hear such words from her.</span></p><p><span style="">Heeeeng. </span></p><p><span style="">The Holy Maiden reeked of Holy Power. &#xA0;When she got off, Shing Shing looked as if it had expelled a 10 year old poop.</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin was about to charge towards the barricade holding back the monsters when Antonio blocked his way.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ah. &#xA0;You can&apos;t! The barricades are rigged with explosives.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What? Did you already detonate it?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&apos;Oh my god!&apos;</span></p><p><span style="">Antonio was surprised when flawless Italian came out of Woojin&apos;s mouth.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;No. &#xA0;It&apos;ll be going off soon.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">He checked his watch then he spoke.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;There&apos;s 59 seconds left. &#xA0;It would be best if you entered after the bombs goes off.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">The advancing monsters were stacked up, because of the barricades. When the rigged bombs went off, it&apos;ll take out a great number of the monsters.</span></p><p><span style="">It would be better to advance after that had happened.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Shit! I&apos;ll see you later, Melody.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes, monarch.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Woojin frowned as he urged Shing Shing forward.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;The bomb is going to&#x2026;.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">While Antonio lamented at his hero&apos;s recklessness, Woojin was already calculating the distance.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I won&apos;t make it in time.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">The explosives would go off before he could get there. It might destroy all the monsters.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Those are my EXP.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">All the monsters bunched up in one place was going to be blown up...</span></p><p><span style="">Fortunately, Woojin had a familiar, who specialized in group hunting.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Jaenis!&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Shwahhhk. </span></p><p><span style="">The black smoke coalesced as the Lich appeared next to Woojin.</span></p><p><span style="">[My lord.] </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Take them all out within 30 seconds.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Jaenis looked at the destroyed city around him. &#xA0;This wasn&#x2019;t anything new, but Jaenis kind of liked what he saw.</span></p><p><span style="">[It is always enjoyable to be able to destroy a city.] </span></p><p><span style="">Shwahhhk! </span></p><p><span style="">Fire came out of Jaenis&apos; Staff. &#xA0;It ignited the barricades, buildings and any obstacles in the way.</span></p><p><span style="">Ggwah-gwah-gwahng! </span></p><p><span style="">It was a large-scale explosion! </span></p><p><span style="">The explosion was followed by flames sweeping the battlefield.</span></p><p><span style="">Hwah-roo-roo-rook! </span></p><p><span style="">If Sunggoo saw this, he would have been surprised by the fire wall. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">The wall of fire burned the monsters, and it even detonated the explosives that still had some time left before they went off.</span></p><p><span style="">Kwah-kwah-kwahng! </span></p><p><span style="">The additional explosions quickly started to engulf the city. &#xA0;Woojin called out his Death Knights.</span></p><p><span style="">Shoo-shoo-shoohk. </span></p><p><span style="">[Ooh-oh-oh. &#xA0;It&apos;s war!] </span></p><p><span style="">[I missed this. The scent of death!] </span></p><p><span style="">[Death is always a noble cause.] </span></p><p><span style="">Woojin smirked when the summoned Death Knights spoke in an excited manner. &#xA0;Their fundamental nature was to hate and envy living beings.</span></p><p><span style="">There was a reason why they had gotten along with him for the past 20 years...</span></p><p><span style="">He let out a laugh.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Isn&apos;t this familiar?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">The tail end of Woojin&apos;s lips rose.</span></p><p><span style="">Everyone laughed. They were excited for the upcoming battle.</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin summoned the Steel Staff while he rode Shing Shing.</span></p><p><span style="">Chwah-roohk! </span></p><p><span style="">He transformed it into an axe. &#xA0;Woojin lashed Shing Shing&apos;s reins.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Let&apos;s go boys.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&lt;Battle Roar has raised the fighting spirit of the allies.&gt; </span></p><p><span style="">&lt;Battle Roar has increased the allies&apos; fighting power.&gt; </span></p><p><span style="">The Death Knight&apos;s followed Woojin&apos;s lead as they rode their Phantom Steeds.</span></p><p><span style="">He had named Kiba the captain of his Dimensional Domain&apos;s defense. &#xA0;It was unfortunate, but he had left Kiba behind just in case.</span></p><p><span style="">[Ooh-oh-oh!] </span></p><p><span style="">[It is a Festival of Blood!] </span></p><p><span style="">The excited Death Knights were galloping as they summoned the Skeletons. &#xA0;There was a trail of Skeletons being summoned behind them. The Skeleton ran in a line behind the Death Knights, and they were swept up by madness. </span></p><p><span style="">Kee-kee-keek! </span></p><p><span style="">As the Undead army charged, Lich Jaenis laughed as he used his flight magic to float into the sky.</span></p><p><span style="">[I heard you awakened as a Warrior.] </span></p><p><span style="">When Woojin looked at him, Jaenis&apos; red eyes gleamed.</span></p><p><span style="">[It really has been a while.] </span></p><p><span style="">Jaenis held his staff with one hand, and he used the other hand to caress the embedded gem on top of the staff.</span></p><p><span style="">Pah-jee-jee-jeek. </span></p><p><span style="">An ominous black energy clashed and sparked. Jaenis spread both his arms.</span></p><p><span style="">Chwah-ah-ah-ahk! </span></p><p><span style="">The black energy crawled like snakes as it shot up into the sky above the city.</span></p><p><span style="">The black energy disappeared as if it had been melted into the air.</span></p><p><span style="">&lt;The Lich&apos;s Curse has descended on the battlefield.&gt; </span></p><p><span style="">&lt;The fighting powers of the enemies will be decreased.&gt; </span></p><p><span style="">&lt;The enemy&apos;s ability to act will be slowed.&gt; </span></p><p><span style="">[Goo-ha-ha. Would my lord like to show me his fighting capability?] </span></p><p><span style="">Didn&apos;t he say he was a Dual Class?</span></p><p><span style="">There was no coincidence in this world. Maybe he would become the key to Jaenis&apos; greatest desire.</span></p><p><span style="">[Goo-uh-uh-uh!] </span></p><p><span style="">As the Undead army charged, Dolsae formed himself from a pile of concrete. The enormous golem started to rage.</span></p><p><span style="">As always, the Titan of Destruction took on the role of the spearhead. &#xA0;The Undead army advanced.</span></p><p><span style="">They headed towards the bold Dimensional lord, who dared to form a colony inside the Colosseum.</span></p><p><span style="">*** </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;My god. &#xA0;This must be a dream.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Antonio was so flustered that he just clutched his head with his hands.</span></p><p><span style="">He was so surprised that he was having a hard time speaking.</span></p><p><span style="">He had met the world&apos;s greatest hero Kahng-woojin! &#xA0;He even exchanged words with him!</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Impossible. &#xA0;This doesn&apos;t make any sense.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hey, Antonio. &#xA0;Come back to your senses. &#xA0;We are still in the battlefield.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ah. &#xA0;I&apos;m sorry... &#xA0;I was too surprised.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Antonio realized his mistake. &#xA0;He hardened his expression. He was an honorable soldier, yet he had acted like a fan girl going wild over a star. &#xA0;Moreover, he had done it in a battlefield where life and death was determined.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Everyone please listen to my words..&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">At the Holy Maiden&apos;s words, all the soldiers directed their attention to her after they got out of the vehicles. &#xA0;She was a beauty, who had accompanied Kahng-woojin here. Her face looked quite familiar&#x2026;. </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;My name is Melody I serve the goddess Aria. &#xA0;My power can touch you only if you believe in the existence of Aria.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">It wasn&apos;t required for them to become worshipers of the Aria church.</span></p><p><span style="">However, they had to acknowledge her existence. &#xA0;This would allow her Holy Power to flow into them. &#xA0;Unfortunately, this was the restriction that had been placed on her.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;This is for all of you. &#xA0;I hope my heart will be conveyed to you all.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Melody gathered her two hands, and she closed her eyes.</span></p><p><span style="">Chaaaaahng! </span></p><p><span style="">Light exploded forth from her, and it brightened the surrounding.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ah&#x2026;.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">The light emitted by her didn&apos;t hurt the eyes. The energy surrounded one&#x2019;s body in a snug manner, and it purified the energy within one&apos;s body.</span></p><p><span style="">It felt as if the mental stress from the battle, various wounds, and depleted stamina was all restored.</span></p><p><span style="">No, it wasn&apos;t just a feeling. &#xA0;It was happening for real.</span></p><p><span style="">The light emitted from her bodysurrounded the wounded soldiers being transported.</span></p><p><span style="">It happened when the light started to lessen.</span></p><p><span style="">The transport trucks had been used to move the injured, and people poured out from these vehicles. &#xA0;One of them was Fabio. He looked for his best friend and comrade Antonio.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Antonio!&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Oh, Fabio! My god!&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Antonio&apos;s eyes turned round when he saw Fabio. Fabio&apos;s arm had been torn off yet a new one had grown in its place. &#xA0;Moreover, Antonio couldn&apos;t see any wounds on him....</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;My god! This is a miracle.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Antonio and Fabio looked at the praying Melody with absentminded eyes.</span></p><p><span style="">He finally remembered her.</span></p><p><span style="">She was the first human to be found inside a Dungeon. &#xA0;It was the SS Rank Roused from the US.</span></p><p><span style="">She was the Holy Maiden Melody.</span></p>
