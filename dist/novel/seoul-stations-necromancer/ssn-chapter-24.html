He called his mother to see when she could get off.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes, mother. I&#x2019;ll see you later.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">After ending the phone call, Woojin looked at Sunggoo.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;We have nothing to do until 3 o&#x2019;clock. Do you want to go eat something?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I&#x2019;ll be honored. Hyung-nim.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Dude. Stop over doing it. &#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Heh heh, I really am honored. Where should I take you?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Mmmm. How about a taste makes me feel like I&#x2019;ve returned to earth?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;&#x2026;.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">He was in trouble. He couldn&#x2019;t think of any witty words he could reply back with. Before the silence lingered, Sunggoo was barely able to give an answer.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hahaha. Should I take you to an organic Korean restaurant? There is a place I know.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Mmm. Let&#x2019;s go there.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin looked out the window, and he pointed at a specific location. Sunggoo rubbed his eyes when he saw it.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Over there?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yeah.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">[Kimbab World]</span></p><p><span style="">Sunggoo berated himself inside.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Now that I&#x2019;ve touched some money I became wasteful. Hyung-nim is still frugal.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin and Sunggoo ordered what they wanted to eat after they parked in front of the Kimbab World. Woojin ordered tuna kimbab(TLN: canned tuna) and Ramen. He had a very blissful expression on his face as he savored the food.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;This. This is it.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">He thought about his old memories, and his 3rd year in high school.</span></p><p><span style="">This is what he had tasted at that time. The 20 years as a necromancer was bypassed, and he felt like the 3rd year high school student from earth.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hoo-roop.(TLN: noodle slurping sfx) Hyung-nim. Which Dungeon should I look up next?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Mmm. Is there something like a monster catalogue out there? It would be better if there was a list where the 1 star and 2 star monsters are ordered by their level.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Of course, it exists.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Let&#x2019;s decided after I see that.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes, sir. I&#x2019;ll show it to you at the cafe after I organize the information.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin and Sunggoo headed towards Angel Angel, and they ordered some coffee. Sunggoo glanced at Woojin before he spoke to the barista.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Is there anything on the menu that represents the earth&#x2019;s taste? Is there something that&#x2019;ll make one feel such a sensation??&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">At Sunggoo&#x2019;s question, the barista frowned as if he saw someone with a couple screws loose. Sunggoo turned to look at Woojin, and even Woojin was looking at him strangely.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;You have a weird taste. I want a Cafe Mocha.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;&#x2026;.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">After Woojin said those words, he went to take a seat. Sunggoo&#x2019;s face turned red.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I would like an Americano and a Cafe Mocha.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes. That would be $10.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Sunggoo brought a vibrating coaster and he took a seat. Woojin slyly asked a question.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;The coffee price these days is nothing to scoff at.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;It&#x2019;s almost priced the same as lunch.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin looked around the cafe&#x2019;s interior. When he came here previously, he had left without ordering anything. He was surprised when the coffee was more expensive than he thought it would be.</span></p><p><span style="">Soup and rice is $6. The price was almost the same as a coffee&#x2026;.</span></p><p><span style="">It wasn&#x2019;t as if there weren&#x2019;t a lot of people here. This large cafe was half full. Woojin indirectly asked a question.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;How much would it cost to set up a store like this?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;A cafe? I&#x2019;m not sure. It should be around 1 million dollars?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">He didn&#x2019;t know how much the rent was, but this cafe was 3 story high. It was a large cafe. Sunggoo was in the dark about such matters, so he guessed at the answer.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;It would be great if I could set one up for mother.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">The coffee price was expensive, so he thought the business will do well. It looked to be less arduous than working at a restaurant. He made $300,000 today. He could make 1 million dollars if he worked hard for 3 days.</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin thought about it in a relaxed manner. If he purchase a house, then he didn&#x2019;t have anything else he wanted. He&#x2019;ll continue to attack the Dungeon to level up, and the money would gather by itself.</span></p><p><span style="">The money itself was trivial. He just wondered if he should set up a store like this, so his mother could have something to occupy her time in relative comfort.</span></p><p><span style="">Pew pew, Pyo-ro-ro-rong..</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin sipped the sweet Cafe Mocha, and he focused on his phone game. While he was occupied, Suggoo brought up some data on his tablet PC.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hyung-nim. I have it here.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Let me see. How do I turn the page on this?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;It&#x2019;s the same as a smart phone, hyung-nim.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin dragged the window to the top of the screen, then he looked at the monster catalogue.</span></p><p><span style="">The Rakwis from the 3 star Dungeon and the monsters like Goblin and Kobold from the 2 star Dungeons were also classified by the number of stars.</span></p><p><span style="">Monsters with 1~3 stars were classified as low ranked monsters. The monsters were classified as high ranked starting from 4 stars.</span></p><p><span style="">The most basic 4 star monster was a troll. Its movement was quick, and it had enough intelligence to use tools. Moreover, they had an abnormal regeneration ability. Still, they weren&#x2019;t that hard to deal with.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I heard the 4 star Dungeons and above looks a little bit different. Of course, I&#x2019;ve personally never been to one.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The 3 star Dungeon kept the original appearance of a subway station. However, the 4 star Dungeons were basically like stepping into a different world. The entrance just acted as a gate.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Well, I&#x2019;ll know once I enter one.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin eyed all the 4 star level monsters. Then he weighed it against his own level.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;It&#x2019;ll be possible if they are at that level.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">There were easy monsters to deal with, but there were also difficult ones too . However, he felt like he would be able to take on monsters as high as 4 stars.</span></p><p><span style="">If he wanted to level up, it would probably be better for him to attempt the higher ranked Dungeons early on rather than going for the low ranked Dungeons.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;So who assigns the stars?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;It is a measured value.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What is being measured?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;The Dungeon Energy.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;There is such a thing?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes. Every time a Dungeon is reset, the Dungeon Energy can be measured. Teams read these estimated report to decided if they should attempt a Dungeon or not.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin nodded his head. The stars weren&#x2019;t really assigned to the monsters. It was the grade for the Dungeons. The monsters were categorized depending on which ranked Dungeons they spawn the most at.</span></p><p><span style="">This is why it wasn&#x2019;t strange to see a 3 star monster, a Hobgoblin, in the 2 star Dungeon.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;First, I want to see and experience it. Find out more about the 4 star Dungeons.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;We don&#x2019;t have to line up starting from the 4 star Dungeons. We can make an appointment. I&#x2019;ll look up if there are any empty spots in the schedules.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin learned that the 4 star Dungeons and above were Field type Dungeons. Woojin spent the remaining time listening to Sunggoo&#x2019;s various explanations.</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin and Sunggoo exited the cafe when the appointed time arrived.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hyung-nim. I could take care of these small matters for you.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;No. My mother has to live in the house, so she should see it.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes, hyung-nim. If you need anything, please give me a call.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">He gave a respectful bow. Woojin nodded his head as he saw Sunggoo walk away.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I&#x2019;ve earned a pretty good servant.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Sunggoo sometimes over did things, but he really liked the affable Sunggoo. He headed towards Soongmi&#x2019;s restaurant with light steps.</span></p><p><span style="">Soongmi was sitting on the counter, and she was immersed in her hand phone game. Even though she was in the midst of setting a high score, she threw her phone down as she suddenly stood up.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Uh-muh, Oppa. You came? Did you eat?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yeah. I ate..&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Do you want some coffee?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;No. I&#x2019;m heading back out immediately. Where is my mother?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Wait a moment. I&#x2019;ll call for her.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Soongmi headed inside the kitchen, and she saw Lee-soogyong and the other kitchen ladies busily working since it was lunch time. She was taking care of a stack of dirty dishes.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Un-muh. Mother. Elder brother Woojin is here. Please hurry up and come out.&#x201D; (TLN: Lost in translation. But Soongmi is speaking to Woojin&#x2019;s mom as if she is her mother-in-law)</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;O..ok. Ms. Soongmi. Let me finish this up.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">At Lee-soogyong&#x2019;s awkward exchange, her fellow kitchen ladies made a big fuss about it.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ah-whew. Mrs. Lee must be very happy. Your son is making so much money that you are going to look for a house.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;The way he is making money is like that yankee gentleman, Neil Gates.&#x201D; (TLN: lol)</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Aigo. That&#x2019;s right. I&#x2019;ve heard about him too. His name was Neil or something . I&#x2019;ve heard he makes a lot of money. Your Wooojin is like him.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;That&#x2019;s right. I&#x2019;m so jealous. If my son was like Woojin, I would have immediately quit this job.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Go. Hurry up and go. Your son is waiting for you.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I still have to do my share before going.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">At her fellow kitchen ladies&#x2019; complements, Lee-joonhyung finished washing the dishes with an shy smile on her face. Since she gained a dependable son, the restaurant work didn&#x2019;t feel arduous anymore.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;She&#x2019;ll come out after she finishes what she is doing. Oppa should sit here. It won&#x2019;t be too long.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ok.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Soongmi pulled a chair towards him, and he sat. When he saw Soongmi sit across from him, he asked her a question.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What are you doing?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Heh heh, I&#x2019;m looking at Oppa&#x2019;s face.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Uh-ooh. I feel a bit uncomfortable when something ugly looks at me.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Soongmi&#x2019;s face remained gentle even when she heard Woojin&#x2019;s straightforward comment.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Oh my. You are still so forceful.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Uh-whew. Go make me a cup of cofee.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes, oppa. If oppa feels uncomfortable then I&#x2019;ll look at oppa sparingly.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Now he remembered. He remembered the memories where Soongmi had clung onto him even though he said he didn&#x2019;t like her. While Woojin was drinking the mixed coffee Soongmi made, his mother came out.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;You are here, son?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Behind Mrs. Lee-soogyong, the other kitchen ladies followed her out. They acted as if they had come to look at someone else&#x2019;s precious son. Their gazes made Woojin feel uncomfortable, so he let out a fake cough.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Huhm. Let&#x2019;s go.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ok. Why are we going to go look at houses when he don&#x2019;t have any money?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">With a quiet anticipation, his mother asked the question. Woojin suppress a bitter laugh as he looked at his mother with teary eyes. Well, he guessed it would be ok to go along with this.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What do you mean we don&#x2019;t have any money. This was deposited today.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin showed her the figure on his smart phone. Even though she was secretly filled with anticipation, Lee-soogyong was surprised. When he said he wanted to move to a different house, she thought he had obtained around $5,000.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Th&#x2026;th&#x2026;three hundred thousand dollars?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">At Lee-soogyong&#x2019;s stuttered words, Soongmi&#x2019;s eyes turned round, and she also checked the figure. She hadn&#x2019;t read it wrong.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ooh-wah. Jackpot. It&#x2019;s $380,000! The Roused are the best!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The Roused made a lot of money. They had heard about how much money the Roused made, but they couldn&#x2019;t help but be surprised when they saw it with their own eyes. Woojin&#x2019;s mother, Lee-soogyong, was so surprised that she became tongue-tied.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ah-yooh. Mrs. Lee has an excellent son. In a single day, he was able to make couple hundred thousand.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Haigo. Who cares about that Neil or whatever. Eeeeng. She won&#x2019;t even have to envy Mahnsook.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Who the heck is Mahnsook?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ah, you know about them. The person who sells gas at the snobby large neighborhood</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Eeeng. I heard about him. Ms Kim is so knowledgeable.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ho ho ho. Mrs. Lee has been holding back until now! You said he had come back after playing some game, and you were worried about him.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Quitting your job is the least you can do. You could open up your own restaurant.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;If Mrs. Lee opens up a restaurant, then you can count on me. I&#x2019;ll go there to work for you.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Lee-soogyong came to her senses when she heard her fellow employees prattle on.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;W&#x2026;Woojin?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Let&#x2019;s go see some houses?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin laughed when he looked at her.</span></p><p><span style="">*</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin escorted his mother to look around several houses as a real estate agent guided them. His mother&#x2019;s had a blissful expression on her face as if she was in a dream, and she liked every house we went to.</span></p><p><span style="">There were too many houses she liked, so she was having a hard time choosing one. These houses were much better than the one room, and they were even better than the house they had lived in before his disappearance.</span></p><p><span style="">At the time, they wouldn&#x2019;t have been able to buy houses like these with just $300,000.</span></p><p><span style="">As they were choosing a house, they came across a problem from an unexpected place.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hoong. I don&#x2019;t like this house.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The kindergarten had ended, so Sooah had come to join in their search for a house. However, she acted like a petulant kid as she threw a tantrum at every house they visited.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Why don&#x2019;t you like this house, Sooah?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;We can&#x2019;t have a dog in this house. Mom promised me. If we move to a new house, she&#x2019;ll let me have a dog.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Uh-muh. This kid.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">About a half a year ago, Sooah wanted a dog. However, their residence was too small to have a dog, so Lee-soogyong had promised she would get Sooah one the next time they moved.</span></p><p><span style="">A long time had passed yet Sooah remembered it. When she looked at Sooah, she had on an obstinate face.</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin thought Sooah&#x2019;s antics were cute, so he let out a delighted laugh. Then he spoke to the real estate agent.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I guess an apartment is out of the question. Can we only look at the houses?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Of course. However, the price is a little&#x2026;Hahah.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Well, let&#x2019;s see it first.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Amongst the couple houses on the market, they were able to find a house where everyone liked it.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Oh wow! This house is great&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Sooah jumped around in joy. It was a 2 story house with a small backyard. After the Sadahng station&#x2019;s Dungeon Break, a new rural housing development had formed on the newly available land.</span></p><p><span style="">When the monsters rampaged, many apartments had collapsed. So it was common place to prefer a single home near the stations.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I&#x2019;ll buy this house.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin made a straightforward decision, but the real estate agent had a difficult expression on his face.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;This house was put on the market for a quick sale, so it is priced below the market price. However, it still costs $603,000. The price difference between what you had specified is quite large&#x2026;&#x2026;.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;It&#x2019;s ok. I&#x2019;ll sign the contract.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Then let us return to the office.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The real estate agent called the owner, so they would be able to meet each other at the the office. Woojin gave a call to Sunggoo.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hey, Sunggoo. I&#x2019;m trying to buy a house, but I&#x2019;m a little bit short. Lend me some money.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">[&#x2026;&#x2026;.]</span></p><p><span style="">The worst sin is taking back something after you gave it to the other person&#x2026;..</span></p><p><span style="">[Well, hyung-nim. I was about to buy something, and I&#x2019;m about to sign a contract&#x2026;&#x2026;.]</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Does that mean you don&#x2019;t want to lend me the money?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">[No. It would be my honor to be able to lend my money to hyung-nim.]</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin smirked.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;When we complete the next Dungeon, I&#x2019;ll pay it back with interest.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">[Thank you. Hyung-nim.]</span></p><p><span style="">He was able to solve the problem of the money shortage cleanly. Woojin headed towards the real agent&#x2019;s office.</span></p><p></p></div><p></p>
