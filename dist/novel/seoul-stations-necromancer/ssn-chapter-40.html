Thank you and enjoy~)</span></p><p><span style="">Sunggoo had watched what had happened from atop a roof of a building.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Freaking awesome.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin had deployed the Wall of Bones to pen in the Naga, and he ran straight into the middle of the opposition. Accompanying a shock-wave, a virulent poison cloud started to spread to the surrounding.</span></p><p><span style="">Then the indiscriminate killing started.</span></p><p><span style="">The poison had no effect on Woojin. Woojin had moved through the Naga as he took their lives. When the last Naga struggling from pain died, the Wall of Bones came down.</span></p><p><span style="">The green poisonous cloud, which had filled the Wall of Bones, coalesced into a single location. Wooojin was in the middle of the coalescing poison, and the poison was being sucked into him.</span></p><p><span style="">All of the poisonous gas absorbed back into Woojin as it disappeared.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I&#x2026;insane.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">He was insanely strong. Were Rank A Roused supposed to be this strong? What did Woojin used to do? Why did he hide his strong powers to act as a Rank F Roused?</span></p><p><span style="">Sunggoo felt like Woojin was a person from another world. Somehow, Sunggoo was able to form a bond with such a person. He felt a mixture of surprise, and fear.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hey Sunggoo.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes, hyung-nim.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Sunggoo quickly closed the distance, and Woojin was walked out of the gruesome battlefield.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Collect all the loot.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes, hyung-nim.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin had already used his Marking Magic to point out which items had potential value.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Uh? There aren&#x2019;t any bloodstones, hyung-nim?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Normally Woojin marked the monsters with bloodstones inside their body, but he hadn&#x2019;t marked any of the Naga.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;The Anthropomorphic Race doesn&#x2019;t possess bloodstones.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Just hurry up and pick up the items that are marked.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes, hyung-nim.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Sunggoo started picking up spears, armors and other items that were marked. He would have to go through almost 100 Naga corpses.</span></p><p><span style="">Sunggoo&#x2019;s &#x2018;Acceleration&#x2019; Skill was first used on a stage where he had to collect the loot.</span></p><p><span style="">During all of this, Woojin headed towards the Naga&#x2019;s temple.</span></p><p><span style="">The building had a basic circular design, and an altar was placed in the middle. As if they were protecting the altar, there was a statue of a Naga Warrior on the right, and a Naga Sorcerer on the left. They stood there in an imposing manner.</span></p><p><span style="">The Return Stone was floating in the middle of the altar.</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin walked to the altar, and he obtained the Return Stone. Then a box suddenly appeared below where the Return Stone used to be. When he opened it, he saw a single ring.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I guess there is only one since this is a basic Dungeon.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">When he cleared it for the first time, he had earned 3 rings. However, this was a recursive Dungeon, so it seemed it only gives 1 ring now.</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin took the ring, then he pried the red gem embedded on the pommel of the sword carried by the Naga Warrior statue. Then he took out the blue gem embedded in the forehead of the Naga Sorcerer statue.</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin used the Analyze magic on the 3 items.</span></p><p>&lt;Ring of Healing&gt;</p><p><span style="">The ring received by the Naga Princess as a wedding gift.</span></p><p><span style="">When Equipped Heal +10</span></p><p>&lt;Naga Warrior&#x2019;s Keepsake&gt;</p><p><span style="">You can earn the same strength as the Naga Warriors.</span></p><p><span style="">Strength +3</span></p><p>&lt;Seal of a Naga Sorcerer&gt;</p><p><span style="">Seal of a Naga Sorcerer.</span></p><p><span style="">Magic +3</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Not bad.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">One was an Artifact that adjusted one&#x2019;s Stat. The other two were consumable items.</span></p><p><span style="">Even if this was a basic summons Dungeon, the loots here was quite good. Of course, it wasn&#x2019;t as good as the first rewards.</span></p><p><span style="">He had earned 3 Artifacts, and 7 consumable items.</span></p><p><span style="">Even though the reward lessened, he could still make a tidy profit.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Now that I think about it I should have more main skills available for the Warrior Class.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">New skills were released every 10 levels for all classes. When Woojin reached level 30, he learned the main skills of a Necromancer. He could now use Golem Summon and Poison Nova. This was also true for the Warrior class.</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin opened the Point Store, then he purchased all the level 30 Warrior Skills he found.</span></p><p>&lt;Earth Strike&gt;</p><p><span style="">Strike the earth with a large hammer to attack the enemies.</span></p><p><span style="">Energy consumed : 3</span></p><p>&lt;Whirlwind&gt;</p><p><span style="">Strike the surrounding enemy as you rotate your weapon.</span></p><p><span style="">Energy consumed : 1 per Cycle</span></p><p>&lt;Blunt Weapon&gt;</p><p><span style="">As one trains in the using blunt weapons, one will become more proficient in using it.</span></p><p><span style="">He also purchased several other skills, but the most important two skills were Earth Strike, and Whirlwind. They were the Warrior Class&#x2019; first AOE attack.</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin immediately summoned his Warrior&#x2019;s Weapon.</span></p><p><span style="">Paht.</span></p><p><span style="">He read the Steel Staff&#x2019;s information.</span></p><p>&lt;Steel Staff&gt;</p><p><span style="">The Warrior&#x2019;s Weapons is basically akin to one&#x2019;s friend and life. The Warrior&#x2019;s Weapon grows with the user. It will always be with you, and it is always be ready for your call.</span></p><p><span style="">Effect : Strength +15, Durability Recovery(During Canceled State)</span></p><p><span style="">Skill : Summon, Cancel, Change (Spear, Hammer)</span></p><p><span style="">The evolved Steel Staff added an additional +5 strength, and it was able to also change into a hammer.</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin immediately changed the staff into a hammer.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ooht-cha.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The head of the staff enlarged into the size of a human&#x2019;s head, and it changed into a large Hammer. Even with his increased strength, the weapon was quite heavy. Woojin staggered when he first used it.</span></p><p><span style="">Hooong, hoong.</span></p><p><span style="">He swung the hammer, but the center of mass was towards the end of the weapon. It wasn&#x2019;t an easy weapon to handle. He swung it couple times, and he got the feel of it.</span></p><p><span style="">The passive skill, &#x2018;Blunt Weapon&#x2019;, was of big help here.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Being a Warrior is quite useful.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">If he want to use it in an actual battle, he would have to practice using it over and over to increase the Skill Level. Still, it seemed quite useful even though he had just learned it right now.</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin canceled his Warrior&#x2019;s Weapon, then he put the loots into his inventory. Then he stepped back outside.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Uh?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Sunggoo should be in the midst of picking up the items, but he wasn&#x2019;t there. Woojin started searching for him, and he found Sunggoo lying down between the Naga.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Are you sleeping on the job?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin grinned as he approached Sunggoo, but Sunggoo didn&#x2019;t say anything. Woojin felt something was wrong, so he ran forward. Woojin saw the sight of Sunggoo on the floor, and his lips had turned blue.</span></p><p><span style="">His eyes were flipped over, and he was shaking. It seemed Sunggoo&#x2019;s life was about to be extinguished.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Poisoned?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin quickly pulled a Naga&#x2019;s soul, then he put the energy into Sunggoo.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ooh ooh ooh. Hy&#x2026;hyung-nim.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Sunggoo regained some of his energy. He looked at Woojin with blurry vision, and he was barely able to open his mouth.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What happened.?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ooh ooh. I cut my hand while I was moving a spear.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The Naga&#x2019;s spear was dipped in poison. Woojin looked at Sunggoo with an expression of disbelief.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Jeez.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin stood up, then he gathered more Naga Spirits, and he poured more energy into Sunggoo. His complexion improved, and he recovered some of his stamina. However, his Poisoned Status did not disappear.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hy&#x2026;hyung-nim. What should I do?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What do you think? You&#x2019;ll just have to die.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;H&#x2026;hyung-nim!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Sunggoo flopped down on to the floor. Ah, so he was going to die like this? His life would come to an end in such a stupid manner?</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin clicked his tongue as he looked at Sunggoo, who had fallen in despair.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Will the Detox Magic work on him?&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">If he wanted to use a proper detoxification or healing spell, he would have to be of the Priest Class or else it would be impossible. Woojin purchased a Detox Magic one could learn before level 10. He had to spend 30 points.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Come here.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Pah-paht!</span></p><p><span style="">The light started formed in Woojin&#x2019;s hand and it passed through Sunggoo. However, his Poisoned Status wasn&#x2019;t dispelled.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Chet. It&#x2019;s not working.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Since it was a low level Detox magic, it could only deal with weak poisons. Weak poisons along the level of causing discomfort to one&#x2019;s stomach.</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin opened his Point Store then he purchased an Antidote. The Antidote suddenly showed up in mid-air in front of Woojin. He handed the Antidote to Sunggoo.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Try drinking this. If this doesn&#x2019;t work, then I really don&#x2019;t have any other methods.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hoo-ook, hook. Yes.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Sunggoo prayed as he opened the bottle&#x2019;s top, then he took a sip.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ooh ooh.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Well? How was it?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Oooh. I&#x2019;m not sure. It tastes like uncarbonated cola.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ah. I&#x2019;m not talking about the taste. Are you being detoxed?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ooh, I&#x2019;m not sure.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin let out a sigh. He took back the Antidote to inspect its information.</span></p><p>&lt;Antidote&gt;</p><p><span style="">It can cure the Poison Status.</span></p><p><span style="">It cannot be given to others.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I guess it won&#x2019;t work on you.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;H&#x2026;hyung-nim.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin bitterly shook his head as he looked at the crying Sunggoo. He had become quite attached to Sunggoo, so it was a shame to send him off like this.</span></p><p><span style="">If he died like this, he&#x2019;ll probably haunt him once again&#x2026;.</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin faced was turning dark.</span></p><p><span style="">He could buy the Detox Magic from the Point Store, but he wasn&#x2019;t of the Magician or Priest class. He had no way of using it.</span></p><p><span style="">Still, he had grown attached to Sunggoo, so Woojin couldn&#x2019;t just send him off without doing anything.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;If you have a will then tell me. I&#x2019;ll pass it on.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Aigo. Hyung-neeeem! Please save me. Ooh-uh-uhng.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Sunggoo cried as he approached Woojin, and he grabbed on to Woojin&#x2019;s pants leg.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Uh uh? Hey. I&#x2019;m not a god. How am I suppose to save you?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">While Woojin was backing away, the content inside the Antidote Bottle sloshed, and it spilled into the surrounding.</span></p><p><span style="">Chee-jee-jee-jeek..</span></p><p><span style="">The Antidote fell on a Naga&#x2019;s Spear nearby, and it let out a sound as it smoked.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Uh?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin&#x2019;s eyes opened wide when he saw this.</span></p><p><span style="">Maybe, if he used it like that?</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ooh-uh-uhg, Hyungneeem. If you save my life, I will never turn on you. Ooh-uh-uh.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Sunggoo had always regretted becoming mad at Woojin in his drunken state. Crazy. He had been crazy. He had lashed out against hyung-nim.</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin pushed Sunggoo, who was tenaciously sticking to Woojin.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hey. Get off me for a sec.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Aigo. Hyung-nim.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Sunggoo wrapped himself around Woojin&#x2019;s legs as if Woojin was his last lifeline. The only one he could believe in now was Woojin.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Uh uh? I might be able to save you, so get off me.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Is that true? If you can save me, I&#x2019;ll do whatever you want.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Then get off me first.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;No. I won&#x2019;t. I will never let go until you save me.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Huh. Jeez.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin looked at Sunggoo, who was tenaciously clinging on to him. Woojin clicked his tongue.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Then open your mouth.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Sunggoo raised his head in surprise. Woojin spoke as he met Sunggoo&#x2019;s eyes. Sunggoo was told to do as Woojin instructed, then he would be saved.</span></p><p><span style="">Sunggoo was wrapped around both legs of Woojin, and his gaze fell on that place&#x2026;. He said to open his mouth. Does that mean&#x2026;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Ah.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">Sunggoo groaned.</span></p><p><span style="">He had to either die as a man or live as a gay.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hook hook. Hyung-nim. You swung that way? Hoo-uhng. Why didn&#x2019;t you tell me before?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Did you go mad from being at death&#x2019;s door? Your face is already blue. Hurry up and open your mouth.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Sunggoo&#x2019;s recovered stamina was quickly dwindling in his poisoned state. Sunggoo was becoming dizzy. While he cried, he grabbed Woojin&#x2019;s belt.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What&#x2026;what the hell are you doing? Didn&#x2019;t I tell you to open your mouth??&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hook hook. Don&#x2019;t I need to take it out first? Hoo-uh-uhng.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Sunggoo cried as he tried to unbuckle Woojin&#x2019;s belt.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ah, this mother fucker is giving me a headache.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin grabbed Sunggoo&#x2019;s head, and he forcefully pulled it back.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ahhhhhk!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">As his head was pulled backwards, Sunggoo cried out in pain. Woojin poured the antidote into Sunggoo&#x2019;s mouth.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ahhhk-gahhhk-gooroooook.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Accompanying a scream, and a gargling noise, the antidote disappeared into Sunggoo&#x2019;s gullet.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ggoo-rook. Kuk, kuk.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">It seemed the liquid went into his airway, so Sunggoo coughed as he cried.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hook hook. Does hyung-nim like the rough stuff?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Why don&#x2019;t you just shut your mouth unless you want to be beaten?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hoo-ook.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;You&#x2019;ve been detoxed..&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hoo-ook, yes? What?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Sunggoo was started touching his face in surprise. He didn&#x2019;t have any fever, and his sight had returned to normal. The pain in his head was gone, and he was now sure he had escaped his poisoned state.</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin smiled when he saw this.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Now I know how to use the consumable items.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">The items bought from the Point Stores will lose its magical property at the same time as it was given away. When Sunggoo drank the antidote by himself, it had turned into regular water.</span></p><p><span style="">It seemed only Woojin could use it.</span></p><p><span style="">If he couldn&#x2019;t transfer it to someone, then he would just have to use it himself. He just had to feed it to the other person.</span></p><p><span style="">Sunggoo was filled with joy from the fact that he would live, and a strong question popped up in his mind. This was the most important question in Sunggoo&#x2019;s life now.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Then I don&#x2019;t have to do it?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Did this bastard go mad from the poisoning?</span></p><p><span style="">This guy was uttering nonsense for some time now.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hyung-nim wasn&#x2019;t a homosexual?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;&#x2026;.&#x201D;</span></p><p>&lt;Warrior&#x2019;s Rage have been activated.&gt;</p><p>&lt;Your Stat has been increased. Duration time 30, 29&#x2026;.&gt;</p><p><span style="">Woojin summoned his Bone Spear.</span></p><p><span style="">Why did he save this kid? He couldn&#x2019;t reign in his anger.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I guess you need a little bit of a beating.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hook hook. I knew it. You lean towards the S&amp;M&#x2026;&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tears flowed down Sunggoo&#x2019;s face as he modestly pushed his butt toward Woojin.</span></p><p>&lt;Your deep anger has leveled up the &#x2018;Warrior&#x2019;s Rage&#x2019;!&gt;</p><p>&lt;The countdown will start from the increased time. Duration time 45, 44&#x2026;.&gt;</p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hooooo.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The frowning Woojin&#x2019;s forehead furrowed deeper.</span></p><p></p></div><p></p>
