<p><strong>Chapter 58 The Meaning of Family.</strong></p><div id="chapterContent" class="innerContent fr-view"><p>Chapter 58 &#x2013; The Meaning of Family</p><p></p><hr><p></p><p><span style="">(TLN: This is a sponsored chapter. Thank you Thomas for the donation and kind words. I found out Bibi&#x2019;s name should be ViVi, but I&#x2019;m going to stick to Bibi. It is pronounced the same in Korean. There are some gaming terminology I am unfamiliar with since I don&#x2019;t play LOL. So there might be some minor errors if I misunderstood those terms. Please turn off the adblockers if you are able to. Thank you and enjoy~)</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Assault? I did?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Yes, president. You beat him up on a live national broadcast.</span></p><p><span style="">However, Minchan didn&#x2019;t reply with those words.</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin frowned when everyone stayed silent.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Didn&#x2019;t I touch his cheeks slightly? I heard from Haemin that it was shown on tv for only a brief moment.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Even if it was shown for only a moment, it didn&#x2019;t change the fact that it was an assault&#x2026;.</span></p><p><span style="">Soonghoon was experienced with Woojin touching his cheeks. He shuddered as his face became rigid.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Huh. Maybe I should have just killed him.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The cameras had been rolling, so he had held himself back a little bit&#x2026;</span></p><p><span style="">He thought his message had been sufficiently received, so he hadn&#x2019;t expected to be reported for assault.</span></p><p><span style="">It seemed the Hwarang guild master wanted to continue to tangle with him.</span></p><p><span style="">Someone had to die to end a grudgeful relationship, and Woojin was always alive at the end.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hey, Sunggoo. You&#x2019;ll have to drive me.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hyung-nim. If you want to go to the police station, you can go in the morning.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">At Sunggoo&#x2019;s worried words, Woojin&#x2019;s eyebrows rose.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Why would I go to the police station?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;T&#x2026;then where do you want to go?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Let&#x2019;s go to the Hwarang Guild.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;&#x2026;.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">When everyone&#x2019;s faces made worried expressions, Woojin grinned as he glanced at everyone.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I&#x2019;ll take care of it, so why are you guys looking so worried?&#x201D;&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">How could they not be worried?</span></p><p><span style="">Jung-minchan stepped forward to calm Woojin. It would be a problem if this incident ballooned.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Please let me take care of this.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">It would be laughable to comply with every summons. He was a guild master. Hwarang probably didn&#x2019;t want the authorities to carry out the sentence for assault. They were probably working a different angle.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Wouldn&#x2019;t that be too annoying?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Even if it is annoying work, I will be doing the annoying work. Isn&#x2019;t that fine?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Huh? That made sense&#x2026; He had made the guild to use these guys for incidents like this&#x2026;</span></p><p><span style="">Jung-minchan noddded his head as he watched Woojin put on an impassioned expression.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Then you take care of it.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">He knew it. If Woojin didn&#x2019;t have to do annoying work, then he didn&#x2019;t&#x2019; care what happened. Maybe he had needlessly reported it to Woojin, and worried about it.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;So when will I be able to go to the US?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;The consortium is scheduled 1 month from now. You should go at that time.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hmmm. So I have one month.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">He wanted to meet the Holy Maiden, but he didn&#x2019;t feel the need to be in a hurry&#x2026; Moreover, he still had had to train Sunggoo.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Is there anything else I need to resolve right now?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I do have something that needs your approval. Please allow me to recruit more manpower.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">To solve this current problem, he would have to immediately hire a lawyer. Moreover, he had to expand the manpower of the Support Division.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;While you are at it, pick out some Roused too.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Mmmm. If we aren&#x2019;t in a hurry, then wouldn&#x2019;t it be better to pick the Roused after we fill out the Support Division? Even if we pick the Roused right now, we don&#x2019;t have the manpower to support them.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Then do as you like.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes, sir. Please leave everything to me. President should go rest a little bit.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin grinned.</span></p><p><span style="">It would be good for him to worry less. However, he didn&#x2019;t have the time to rest. If earth wanted to survive like Alphen, then he had to think about survival first. He didn&#x2019;t want this place to turn in a hostile place.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I&#x2019;m going home. I&#x2019;ll see you guys tomorrow.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes. Please head out.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">After receiving a send-off from everyone, Woojin headed toward his home.</span></p><p><span style="">The housing district wasn&#x2019;t very from the Sahdahng Station, so he walked slowly to his home. He had come here once when they signed the contract, so he wasn&#x2019;t worried about getting lost.</span></p><p><span style="">When he was almost at his home, Woojin stopped walking.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ah. What&#x2019;s the secret password to the house&#x2026;? I guess mother is asleep.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin stopped walking, and he was about to take out his phone when he decided to put his phone back into his picket. It was 3 AM right now. He had been hardened on the battlefields, so he didn&#x2019;t care too much about sleep. Even if he stayed up for several nights, he wouldn&#x2019;t die. He didn&#x2019;t feel the need to make a ruckus so early in the morning.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I&#x2019;ll just come back later in the morning.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin changed his steps towards downtown.</span></p><p><span style="">Unlike Woojin, Sunggoo was exhausted, so his phone was off. Jung-minchan and Kim-haemin was busy because of work. Moreover, he couldn&#x2019;t call out Jaemin, who was a student. He felt uncomfortable contacting Jiwon&#x2026;</span></p><p><span style="">It was 3 AM. It was an ambigous time. The person who was walking by Woojin&#x2019;s side on the night street was none other than Woo-soonghoon.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;President. Where should I take you? You just need to tell me, and I will cater to your tastes.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">What did he prefer to do? Woojin looked across the street, and he pointed at a sign with his chin.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Let&#x2019;s go there.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">It was a 5 story building, and there were signs for tutoring schools on each floor. No matter how much he searched the only likely destination was the PC Bahng on the second floor.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Do you mean the PC Bahng?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes. Let&#x2019;s go play some Chaos.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">He hadn&#x2019;t played the game in 20 years, so it was fuzzy in his memories However, he was already excited when he thought about the nostalgic memories.</span></p><p><span style="">He thought about his memories from his 3rd year in high school. The memories almost deluded himself into thinking his dirty and stained soul had become purified.</span></p><p><span style="">He couldn&#x2019;t return to his innocent days where he hadn&#x2019;t lived a hellish life on Alphen, but&#x2026;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin and Soonghoon headed towards the PC Bahng.</span></p><p><span style="">When he looked around the PC Bahng, Woojin gave himself up to his deep emotions. Soonghoon watched Woojin from the side, and he nodded his head at Woojin&#x2019;s mundane choice of hobby. If he had taken Woojin to a room then he would have been scolded.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Please sit over here, president.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;How much do they charge for this now?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin moved the unfamiliar mouse several times. Soon he got used to it, and he started to look for Warcraft. Soonghoon looked over from the side, and he spoke.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;President. We don&#x2019;t play Chaos any more. It isn&#x2019;t popular any more, so you&#x2019;ll have a hard time finding a match.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Is that so? What are they playing these days?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Well, 5 years had passed, and the change in popularity of games in Korea was fickle.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;It is similar to Chaos, but everyone plays LoL now.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Really?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">With Soonghoon&#x2019;s help, Woojin set up an account then he connected to the game.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;President. Please don&#x2019;t pick this one and this one over here..&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Uh. Ok..&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;We can go to the bottom and do a round of bot games. I&#x2019;ll give explain in detail what you should do.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin set the setting Soonghoon recommended, and the game started soon.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;President. Just keep hitting them.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin was a ranged character, who shot arrows. Soonghoon was a support character with a machine arm. The minions charged in a single file when he met the the enemies.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;It&#x2019;s quite similar to Chaos.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes, president. You have some experience playing these kinds of games, so you&#x2019;ll are doing well.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">As he listened to Soonghoon&#x2019;s praises, Woojin had a good time. It had been awhile since he had fun. The computer&#x2019;s AI wasn&#x2019;t that great, so he easily won the game.</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin smiled. It had been a long while since he played a game.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;This is pretty fun.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Then let&#x2019;s go into the queue instead of playing bot games.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;All right.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I&#x2019;m coming in as a Smurf.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Soonghoon brought his level 5 character, and he entered the queue with Woojin. People were much better than the AI, and Woojin kept dying since he was unfamiliar with the game.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ah. I made a mistake again..&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hahaha. It&#x2019;s all right, president. You are doing really well..&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Soonghoon tried hard to ingratiate himself to Woojin. Soonghoon&#x2019;s heart pounded as he looked at the rapidly scrolling chat box.</span></p><p><span style="">[Hey retard. Stop throwing the match.]</span></p><p><span style="">[Do you only charge when you see a red hp? Are you that weak?]</span></p><p><span style="">[Isn&#x2019;t your mother sick?]</span></p><p><span style="">[Catch the minion to make her some medicine.]</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ah. Are they insulting me or are they worried about me?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ah-haha. There are good kids and bad kids on here&#x2026;&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Chet. Still, these kids are devoted sons.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Kids&#x2026; He was a high rank Roused, and his actions were overflowing with charisma. It made him forget at times that Woojin was only 24 years old.</span></p><p><span style="">He was much younger than Soonghoon.</span></p><p><span style="">Is it because he is a high rank? He turned to look at Woojin, and he couldn&#x2019;t&#x2019; think of Woojin as someone younger than him.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Haha. It would be best if you ignored the chat..&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;No. These kids are kind.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">[Thank you. Is your mother also in good health?]</span></p><p><span style="">Soonghoon became freaked out as he looked at what Woojin wrote in the chat. The chat box started being assaulted by insults.</span></p><p><span style="">[Hey you troll fucker. How dare you insult my mother?]</span></p><p><span style="">[Hey xxxxxxxx]</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What the hell?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin was taken aback. Before he became angry, Soonghoon turned off the chat box.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Haha. Usually everyone turns their chat box off in the beginning.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hmm. Was it this bad back in the day?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">It was only 5 years ago. In Woojin&#x2019;s memories, it was 20 years ago. At the time, many people used foul words through the anonymity of the internet, but he wondered if it had been as bad as this.</span></p><p><span style="">After turning off his chat, it turned into something like a private lesson. Under the tutelage of Soonghoon, match after match passed.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Haha. Would you like some ramen, president?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ah, that&#x2019;ll be great.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Eating a cup ramen was a delicacy one had to try in a PC Bahng. Woojin was lost in his memories when he suddenly became surprised.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What time is it?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes? It&#x2019;s 11 am.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Shit.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">He had wanted to return at 7 AM when the sun rose into the sky. He had been having so much fun that he had lost track of the time.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I&#x2019;m going home.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes, president.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes. It was fun. Keep up the good work.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;&#x2026;.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin patted Soonghoon&#x2019;s shoulder, then he disappeared like a elementary student who had run out of money.</span></p><p><span style="">Soonghoon had frozen as he was about to open the cup ramen. His expression was reflecting the emotions he felt.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;H&#x2026;he said he had fun.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Great. The president acknowledged him.</span></p><p><span style="">He had found a way. His existence had been acknowledged, and he found the answer to how he&#x2019;ll be able to climb to a higher position.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I&#x2019;ll make you have more fun, president.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Soonghoon poured water into the cup ramen.</span></p><p><span style="">*</span></p><p><span style="">Ding-dong.</span></p><p><span style="">[Who is it?]</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Mother. It&#x2019;s me.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">At Woojin&#x2019;s voice, the front door opened in haste as his mother showed up. She hugged Woojin then she looked over his body.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Aigo, you scoundrel. Why do you keep showing up on TV so often? Are you ok?&#x201D;&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Haha. The TV is over-reacting. It isn&#x2019;t a big deal.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;If they cancel the dramas to show news, then how can it not be a big deal?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What about Sooah?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;She went to kindergarten. Anyways, Director Jung said you were coming here at dawn, so why were you so late? I waited up into the early morning, but I fell asleep&#x2026;</span></p><p><span style="">Ah, did she wait up the whole night for him? No wonder she looked tired around the eyes. Woojin felt sorry, so he scratched the back of his head. It wasn&#x2019;t his intent, but it seemed he had been neglecting his mother too much while he went around the Dungeons.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Haha. I was going to come here in the morning, but I was late playing a game in the PC Bahng.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;&#x2026;.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">At Woojin&#x2019;s embarrassed words, his mother&#x2019;s expression hardened a little bit.</span></p><p><span style="">The worried light in his mother&#x2019;s eyes for her son changed in a weird way. She was worried, but&#x2026;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Haigo, you scoundrel. You spent 5 years playing game yet you went to play more game.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Uh&#x2026; That was a game he played with his life on the line. This was something different&#x2026; It brought up old memories&#x2026;.</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin was barely able to calm his mother, then he entered the first house he had purchased. He had seen the house when he signed the contract, but it looked different with furnitures. It also had a different interior design. He knew this was his home, so he felt a different sensation when he entered his home.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I heard you were busy looking around for furnitures. I knew my mom had great tastes.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hoo. Try going to your room..&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">His mother acted as if she was trying to hand him a toy she had secretly hidden. Her expression was full of anticipation.</span></p><p><span style="">Ah, it seemed she had prepared something for him again.</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin opened the door to his room.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Uh?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The room didn&#x2019;t have a lot of stuff. There was tacky wallpaper around the room with an old desk, bookcase and a single bed.</span></p><p><span style="">The atmosphere within the room was starkly different from the rest of the house, so Woojin tilted his head in confusion. Then he ran his hand over the used desk.</span></p><p><span style="">He looked around the room, and it was weirdly familiar.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Mother. This is&#x2026;&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes. You told me you missed your old room&#x2026;.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">He had let it slip while he was eating, yet she had remembered it. Woojin&#x2019;s was deeply moved as his heart warmed.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;It isn&#x2019;t the one you used, but I searched long and hard to find this desk.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">He remembered it. This was the desk his father had bought him for entering high school. He had studied on it&#x2026;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;My son is making money with his life on the line yet your mother don&#x2019;t have anything I can do for you&#x2026;.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Yes. It was for his family.</span></p><p><span style="">He had endured all the pain for this. He had wanted to come back to earth even if he had to turn into a monster. He had longed for earth, because his family was there.</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin hugged his mother tightly.</span></p><p><span style="">*</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin rested his eyes for a moment in his room. Bibi kept vigil over his bedside as she gave Woojin the curse of nightmare.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Uh? Oppa&#x2019;s shoes is here! Mooooom! Oppa is here?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Sooah&#x2019;s loud voice woke Woojin from his sleep.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Mom! Did oppa bring a dog?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">When he heard Sooah&#x2019;s voice coming from the living room, Woojin had a moment of realization. His gaze rested on his bedside where the cat Bibi was lazily yawning.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hey, Bibi..&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Nyahng?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Never reveal the fact that you aren&#x2019;t really a cat.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Nyahng? What&#x2019;s going on-nyahng?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">With Bibi in his arms, Woojin headed towards the living room.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hey, Sooah. Oppa bought Sooah a cat.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">At Woojin&#x2019;s words, Bibi and Sooah&#x2019;s gazes met. The surprised Sooah saw Bibi, and she started crying.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ooh-ahhhng. I wanted a dog instead of a cat.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin felt embarrassed, and Bibi had a bad premonition about this. Both of them were taken aback.</span></p><p></p></div><p></p>
