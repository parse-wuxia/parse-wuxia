<p><span style="">Chapter 159 - God of Earth (2)&#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">There was a crowd of people in front of Sooah&apos;s room. &#xA0;When Woojin arrived, he saw Do-jiwon and Cindy within the crowd.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Woojin-ah&#x2026;.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Jiwon&apos;s voice was filled with worry and misery. &#xA0;However, she couldn&apos;t console Woojin. &#xA0;No, it wasn&#x2019;t a situation where she needed to console him.</span></p><p><span style="">The unconscious Sooah had just woken up.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I&apos;ll talk to you later.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;All right.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Woojin walked past the people, and he entered the room. &#xA0;His mother&apos;s face was filled with tears, and her nose was running. &#xA0;She feebly turned her head towards him.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Woojin-ah&#x2026; My Sooah... &#xA0;Sooah doesn&apos;t recognize her mother. &#xA0;Hoo-oohk.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;It&apos;s all right.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Woojin patted his mother on the back.</span></p><p><span style="">She had temporary amnesia?</span></p><p><span style="">She had become a Priestess that will deliver the divine words. &#xA0;However, he had never encountered a situation where the host&apos;s memories were erased.</span></p><p><span style="">It wasn&apos;t an amnesia. &#xA0;Some being had borrowed her body, and its aura was surrounding the small girl.</span></p><p><span style="">A god was manifesting itself by borrowing the body of the priestess.</span></p><p><span style="">Currently, this girl wasn&apos;t his dongsaeng, Sooah. &#xA0;It was literally the unknown god itself.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Please leave for a moment.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Lee-soogyung&apos;s feet was heavy from worry, but they weren&apos;t going to get anywhere by her staying here. &#xA0;She exited the room.</span></p><p><span style="">When the room was occupied by the two of them, the being opened her closed eyes.</span></p><p><span style="">A blinding light was leaking out of her eyes. &#xA0;It was almost impossible to face her. Woojin frowned as he asked a question.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Shouldn&apos;t you at least give an introduction?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">[&#x2026;&#x2026;.] </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;You don&apos;t know your name? &#xA0;Try picking one. &#xA0;Jesus, Shakyamuni, Allah... &#xA0;Mmmm. &#xA0;What else is there?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Woojin made invidious remarks. &#xA0;She opened her lips when she heard him.</span></p><p><span style="">However, the sound wasn&apos;t delivered to his ears.</span></p><p><span style="">[I was born from the Seed when this planet went through the Quickening recently. &#xA0;Why would I have a name?] </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hoh. &#xA0;You are a nameless god. The Quickening happened recently?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Was there no other gods on earth? &#xA0;This might be the first god to arrive....</span></p><p><span style="">[I met you when I took my first step. &#xA0;However, I&apos;ve known you for a long time.] </span></p><p><span style="">The smile on Woojin&apos;s face disappeared.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Why don&apos;t you speak intelligently, so I can understand what you are saying?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">[I&apos;ve been watching your deeds.] </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;&#x2026;.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">The light being emitted by her eyes dimmed.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ha-ah. &#xA0;The gods are all the same.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">The gods he met on Alphen was like this. &#xA0;He didn&apos;t know why they spoke in such a transient manner.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Mmmm.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Accompanying a moan, the falling little girl returned to being his dongsaeng, Sooah. The oppressive magical energy surrounding her had disappeared.</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin hugged her as she was about to fall to the floor.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ooh-ook.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Sooah&apos;s eyes were half-closed, and her vision flickered. &#xA0;When she saw Woojin, she labored to part her lips.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Oppa&#x2026;.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes. &#xA0;It&apos;s your oppa.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">She had suffered a lot. &#xA0;If she hadn&apos;t been able to endure the process, she would have died. &#xA0;She managed to endure, and she had delivered the god&apos;s voice.</span></p><p><span style="">&lt;Lv 50 Kahng-sooah&gt; </span></p><p><span style="">In a flash, Kahng-sooah had gained the power of the 5th Circle. &#xA0;In earth&apos;s Rank, she was already a Rank B Roused.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Oppa. &#xA0;In my dream, I....&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Woojin gave Sooah a tight hug.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;You did good.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">He was thankful she was able to endure the process, and he was thankful that she was still alive. &#xA0;Sooah blinked her eyes at Woojin&apos;s uncharacteristic gesture.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;So what is the name of the friend that appeared in your dream?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Huh? I don&apos;t know its name....&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;All right. &#xA0;I&apos;ll call mother. &#xA0;You should rest a little bit.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">She had the ability of a 5th Circle Priestess.</span></p><p><span style="">She would be able to use her abilities through her prayers. &#xA0;Sooah will grow up to be a special existence. &#xA0;She would be like the current priestess of the Aria Church, Melody.</span></p><p><span style="">When Woojin exited the room, an employee with a panicked face ran towards him.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;S...something terrible has happened. &#xA0;Kim-kahngchul has run away.&quot; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;&#x2026;.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Woojin wrinkled up his forehead.</span></p><p><span style="">He turned his head slightly to look into Sooah&apos;s room, which he had just exited.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Woojin-ah.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">When Jiwon called his name, Woojin&apos;s gaze landed on her. &#xA0;Her pristine soul was shaking a little bit.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I&apos;ll see you later.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes. &#xA0;All right.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Woojin mussed Jiwon&apos;s head once, then he walked down the corridor. &#xA0;Cindy was by Jiwon&apos;s side, and she asked in a small voice.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Whew. &#xA0;Woojin is incredibly busy.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes, he is.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Are you ok with that? &#xA0;It was announced that you are his girlfriend, but in truth, you don&apos;t get to see him often....&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ha ha. &#xA0;I&apos;m all right.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">She wasn&apos;t lying. &#xA0;Do-jiwon really didn&apos;t mind.</span></p><p><span style="">Kahng-woojin was busy, and she completely understood it. &#xA0;He had saved her life. &#xA0;How shameless would it be for her to complain to get attention from him?</span></p><p><span style="">Jiwon was just thankful that she was able to watch him from closeby.</span></p><p><span style="">He was a dangerous and busy person.</span></p><p><span style="">He was the hero that was saving earth.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Eh-ee. &#xA0;Did you even kiss him yet?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Huh?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">At Cindy&apos;s question, Jiwon&apos;s face turned bright red. &#xA0;Then she looked around her surrounding, and she spoke in a small voice.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;We shouldn&#x2019;t speak about such things here.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">This was the room where the unconscious Sooah had just woken up. &#xA0;It wasn&apos;t the place to joke about such stuff. &#xA0;Jiwon led Cindy by her hand as they exited the room.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Uh-whew. &#xA0;You have it pretty rough.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Cindy let out &#xA0;a sigh.</span></p><p><span style="">She was the lover of the most famous man in the world, yet it looked to be a hard life to be loved by him.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;So when are you going back home?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Uh? &#xA0;A...am I a bother?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I didn&apos;t mean it that way.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Cindy was surprised by Jiwon&apos;s sudden question. &#xA0;When she replied back, Jiwon shook her head. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">A couple days ago, Cindy had called her out of the blue.</span></p><p><span style="">Cindy seemed to have suffered lingering trauma from the reunion, and she had halted all her media activity. &#xA0;She was on a break. &#xA0;However, it seemed she still had anxiety attacks, so she had asked Jiwon for help. &#xA0;Cindy had wondered if she could recuperate in Alandal.</span></p><p><span style="">Do-jiwon received permission from Minchan, who was the Prime Minster, and she had invited Cindy over.</span></p><p><span style="">Cindy had already lived with her for 3 days, and Jiwon had a feeling that this living situation would last for a long time. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Eh-whew. &#xA0;It seems not everyone can be the lover of a hero.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;&#x2026;.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I don&apos;t think I could do it even if it cost me my life.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Jiwon didn&apos;t have a retort for Cindy&apos;s words.</span></p><p><span style="">*** </span></p><p><span style="">Woojin looked out the broken window as he surveyed the bustling training ground. &#xA0;Then he turned his gaze towards the fallen Woo-soonghoon.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;He isn&apos;t conscious, but he is still alive.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">At the security guard&apos;s words, Woojin plucked a soul that was hovering around him, and he let it absorb into Soonghoon.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ooh ooh.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Soonghoon had regained his vigor. &#xA0;He let out a moan as he got off the floor.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;P...president. No, my king.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What happened?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;He was talking nonsense when he suddenly threw something at me. &#xA0;Afterwards, I....&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What did he say?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I can&apos;t remem&#x2026; Ah! &#xA0;He was saying something about whether coincidences can happen in this world.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Coincidence.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Woojin let out a bitter laugh.</span></p><p><span style="">Was it called the Moon World? &#xA0;Toppler was part of this organization, and they were supporting Kim-kahngchul.</span></p><p><span style="">Those bastards wanted to talk with Woojin. &#xA0;However, they wanted to do so while hiding their real identities in the dark.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;You should take care of your body more. &#xA0;You should exercise a little bit.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;&#x2026;.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">How could he face a Roused just from doing some exercise? &#xA0;In the first place, there wasn&apos;t anyone in Alandal right now that could keep Kim-kahngchul aside from Woojin. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">It was partially Kahng-woojin&apos;s fault. He had thought Kim-kahngchul was in a defenseless state.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Well, you should get some rest. &#xA0;You over there. &#xA0;Tell Minchan to come to my room.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes, sir!&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Before the secretary could exit, he started to backpedal. &#xA0;It seemed Jung-minchan had already heard the news, and he had come running to this location. &#xA0;It wasn&apos;t necessary to call him.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What happened?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What do you think happened? Put Kim-kahngchul on the wanted list.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What? &#xA0;For what crime&#x2026;. &#xA0;If one objectively looks at the circumstances, the president.... &#xA0;It looks as if the king had kidnapped Mr. Kim-kahngchul.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Kim-kahngchul had appeared for the interview, and Woojin had abruptly fought with him. &#xA0;Woojin had dragged a half-crippled Kim-kahngchul into Alandal. &#xA0;As if troubled by Minchan&apos;s words, Woojin stroked his chin. &#xA0;Then he looked towards the damaged window.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Just say he committed vandalism.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;&#x2026;.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">He just had to make up a crime.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;This won&apos;t hold up in Korea.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I&apos;m not trying to catch him. &#xA0;Just do it.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Understood.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Minchan was quick on the uptake, so he understood the purpose behind Woojin&apos;s order. &#xA0;If a bulletin on his wanted status was sent out, the suspect will have to constantly look over his back. &#xA0;He&apos;ll be extra careful as not to be found, and this will restrict his movements.</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin wanted to suppress Kim-kahngchul&apos;s activities. </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Tell me if the preparation for the general guild assembly is going well. &#xA0;I&apos;ll be out in 3 days time.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes. People from numerous guilds around the world are arriving in Korea. &#xA0;We&apos;ve provided them a place to stay at the KH Hotel.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;You take care of those details. &#xA0;What about the newly chosen employees?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;We are doing a background check, and we have to gauge each of their abilities...&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Send them into my room. &#xA0;I&apos;ll return after training them for about 3 days.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;&#x2026;.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">He said three days, but it was 12 days time inside the Dungeon.</span></p><p><span style="">They had just joined an hour ago, yet they would be going into a Dungeon with Kahng-woojin. &#xA0;Will they be able to quickly adapt?</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Isn&apos;t it too early? &#xA0;Maybe we should prepare them a little bit more before deploying them. The problem is whether they&apos;ll be able to adapt...&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Minchan.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes, sir.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Woojin&apos;s single word stopped Prime Minister Jungminchan&apos;s words in its track.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;The ones that adapt well will survive the battle. &#xA0;Right?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;If they are to adapt well to the situation, they need to be trained well.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;You are correct.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I&apos;m not taking them to a war zone. &#xA0;It is only a hunting ground.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Depending on the person, it wasn&apos;t a hunting ground. &#xA0;It was a place where one had to fiercely compete for one&#x2019;s survival.</span></p><p><span style="">However, Minchan did refute his words. </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I&apos;ll immediately prepare them, and I&apos;ll send them up.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I won&apos;t wait long. &#xA0;Ready them quickly.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes, sir..&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">As if he had said all he needed to say, Woojin exited the room to go up to his office.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Whew.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Jung-minchan let out the breath he had been holding. &#xA0;He didn&apos;t know if it was Kim-kahngchul&apos;s escape or Kahng-sooah&apos;s recoveredd consciousness, but Kang-woojin&apos;s mood was sharp. &#xA0;It was different from his normal mood.</span></p><p><span style="">Minchan immediately went to the conference room where the new recruits were waiting for him. &#xA0;They were going through the contract with a fine-toothed comb. &#xA0;When they signed it, they&apos;ll gain citizenship to Alandal.</span></p><p><span style="">They would become citizens of Alandal, but business were conducted like any other guild. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">They had to clear and maintain Dungeons. &#xA0;Moreover, they had to suppress the monster when Breaks occurred.</span></p><p><span style="">The only thing different was that no country held jurisdiction over this guild. &#xA0;Moreover, Alandal operated with the world as its stage.</span></p><p><span style="">No, they even operated in planets located in different dimensions....</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I want all your attention.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;&#x2026;.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">The twenty three pairs of worried eyes headed towards Prime Minister Jung-Minchan. </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Everyone will be following the king into a Dungeon right now.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What are you talking about? &#xA0;We haven&apos;t even signed the contract yet.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;That&apos;s right. &#xA0;We haven&apos;t even decided if we are going to join, yet you suddenly spring a Dungeon run on us.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Minchan shook his head from side to side as if he was in a difficult spot.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;That isn&apos;t important right now. &#xA0;I want you all to engrave my words into your heart. &#xA0;It will increase your chance for survival. &#xA0;When you enter the Dungeon, do not stray far away from the King, and this includes the Death Knights....&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Look here! Don&apos;t we have any rights here?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Isn&apos;t this too forceful of a method?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I don&apos;t want to join this guild. &#xA0;I&apos;ll be leaving. &#xA0;Please let me out.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;&#x2026;.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">The people, who passed the interview, continued to complain. &#xA0;Minchan&apos;s complexion darkened. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">It seemed these people were under some kind of a delusion.</span></p><p><span style="">At that moment, the conference room&apos;s door opened, and Kahng-woojin entered.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Everyone&apos;s gathered.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">It seemed Woojin hadn&apos;t planned on waiting. &#xA0;He immediately came looking for them.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;If everyone is here, we&apos;ll go.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Zzeeeeeeng. </span></p><p><span style="">Woojin opened the portal heading towards Alandal.</span></p><p><span style="">Nervousness appeared on the faces of people when the portal was suddenly formed.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I&apos;m out.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Woojin looked at the person, who spoke, as he tilted his head.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Says who?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Woojin looked at every single face once before he opened his mouth.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I want to protect earth. &#xA0;What about you guys?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;&#x2026;.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Why was he talking in such grandiose terms? &#xA0;Everyone was having a hard time answering the question.</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin continued to speak.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;If you are here for a free ride, you can leave.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;R...really? &#xA0;We can leave here?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Of course, you&apos;ll have to leave earth.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;W...what kind of&#x2026;.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Woojin smirked as he stood in front of the portal.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;If you want to pass through this portal as a dead Skeleton, take a seat. &#xA0;If you want to be alive when you leave, get in a single line. &#xA0;Start.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;&#x2026;!&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Koo-da-tahng! </span></p><p><span style="">Before Wooijn&apos;s words could end, people pushed aside the desk. &#xA0;They scrambled to form a line in front of Woojin.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Tell me your numbers.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;One.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Two.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x2026;&#x2026;. </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Twenty three.
