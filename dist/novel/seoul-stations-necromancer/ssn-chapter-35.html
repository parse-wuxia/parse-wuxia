This is the last chapter for the day. I&#x2019;ll try to have one out tomorrow. Thank you for the donation Gary. Please turn off the adblockers if you are able to. Thank and enjoy~)</span></span></p><p><span style="">He entered by breaking the regulation, so will he be arrested or be given a penalty?</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Haha&#x2026;.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">It was when everyone&#x2019;s attention was focused on him, Woojin saw the security personnel that was still hanging around the station. He spoke towards the one who had pushed him.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Uh-ooh, ahjuhshi. What were you doing pushing me? I almost died.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I&#x2026;I didn&#x2019;t push you&#x2026;&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin approached the security personnel then he gave an exaggerated hug.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hahaha. It&#x2019;s alright. Everything is fine since I&#x2019;m still alive. Ahjuhshi was probably also surprised? You don&#x2019;t have to feel guilty. Aren&#x2019;t I still alive?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">No. How can this be considered just being alive? This was the first incident where a Roused had successfully cleared a 5 star Dungeon by himself.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Uh uh? Hey. Hey. Hurry up and turn the camera.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The people from the tv station, who were taking a break, started to busily set up their cameras.</span></p><p><span style="">When the announcer spoke, Woojin&#x2019;s image was captured by the camera, and it was broadcasted to the entire country.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;We are bringing you some breaking news. Mr. Kang, who had accidentally fallen into the Dungeon, has surprisingly come back out alive. We have no idea what has happened, but I will try to interview the person directly involved.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">When Jung-minchan saw the announcer approaching Woojin, he sidled up next to Woojin. Minchan took off his coat then he placed it around Woojin.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Uh?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin was confused, but Minchan quickly placed an arm around him.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Please dont&#x2019; do anything. If your identity is revealed through the press, then the press and people around the country will gather to bother you.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">That couldn&#x2019;t happen. Woojin obediently put the jacket over his head. Sunggoo was quick on the uptake, and he also sidled up next to Woojin. Kim-haemin quickly went to get his car, so they could make a quick exit.</span></p><p><span style="">During all of this, Jung-minchan blocked the path of television crew, and the reporters who were relentlessly pressing down on their camera&#x2019;s shutter.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;He has just barely made it back out alive from the 5 star Dungeon. He is declining to do an interview. He requires stability right now.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Who are you dt block us? Doesn&#x2019;t the public have the right to know?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Several complaining reporters recognized Jung-minchan&#x2019;s face.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Isn&#x2019;t he a Hammer guild&#x2019;s team leader?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Does that mean the Roused in the accident is part of the Hammer Guild?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Was this incident disguised as an accident, so the Hammer guild could snatch the Dungeon away?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Jung-minchan became serious when he heard the reporters talking in whispers.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Please stop these speculative reporting. I will sue you. If the personal information of the Roused is leaked then we will respond strongly.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Minchan blocked the reporters, who were trying to earn at least a single shred of information. Haemin brought his car around during all of this.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Team leader! Over here.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Sunggoo and Woojin quickly entered the back seats. When Minchan also got in the car, Haemin quickly drove into the crossroads before the mass of people could crowd around the car.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Whew. It felt like I&#x2019;ve turned into a criminal.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Michan let out a sigh when he heard Woojin&#x2019;s words.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Whew. I&#x2019;m not really sure if I am in a dream or not.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Minchan&#x2019;s heart pounded. His intuition had pointed out Woojin, but he would have never guess Woojin would be able to clear a 5 star Dungeon by himself&#x2026;. Moreover, it was an undisclosed Dungeon.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;So what happened?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What do you mean? I was pushed, and I entered co.incident.ally?&#x201D; (TLN: he clipped the word coincidentally into 3 parts)</span></p><p><span style="">Minchan smirked at Woojin, who answered a question with a question. If someone saw him right now, who in their right mind would think this person just came out of a 5 star Dungeon?</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;So how was the Dungeon?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ah. It was somewhat of a hairy experience.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;It must have been an arduous experience, since you weren&#x2019;t able to bring out any loot.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Ah, it was a in his sub-dimension. He was late, because he was gathering every last drop of bloodstones&#x2026;.</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin didn&#x2019;t feel the need to tell him the truth.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Well, it was something like that.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Jung-minchan half-turned his body from the passenger seat, and he stared straight at Woojin.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;There will be a lot of noise in the media for awhile. Don&#x2019;t go to a Dungeon for the time being. Better yet don&#x2019;t even come out. The Hammer guild will try its best to block the reporters, and the tv crews.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin grinned at Minchan&#x2019;s words. Why was he putting so much effort into him? Why was this ahjuhshi so amicable towards him?</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What&#x2019;s the catch?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Minchan gulped down his saliva.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Will you join the Hammer guild? Your ability is already proven now, so it would be possible for me to get you the vice president&#x2019;s seat. I&#x2019;ll be able to get the authorization from the president with no problem. Moreover, we will make a team just for Woojin-nim. You will also have free reign to choose your team members.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Sunggoo, who was listening to the conversation from the side, gulped down his saliva.</span></p><p><span style="">It was understandable. There were only 10 Rank A Roused in Korea. Woojin had suddenly emerged, and he might be a new Rank A Roused. Of course, he would be treated well, but this was too shocking.</span></p><p><span style="">Sunggoo stopped breathing as his eyes headed towards Woojn&#x2019;s lips. Even Haemin, who was driving, pointed his ears towards Woojin as he focused on what Woojin would say.</span></p><p><span style="">*</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Chet. Why does he have to go to a place like that to get publicity?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Hammer guild&#x2019;s president Park-sahngoh clicked his tongue as if he was displeased. His ire rose when he saw team leader Jung-minchan&#x2019;s face on the breaking news.</span></p><p><span style="">The 5 star Dungeon was only two station down from the Sahdahng station yet the Hwarang guild was in line to be the first one to attack the Dungeon. Minchan had the galls to linger around there.</span></p><p><span style="">In the first place, wasn&#x2019;t he trying to scout a necromancer name Woojin or whatever? Wasn&#x2019;t this the price of neglecting his original duties?</span></p><p><span style="">When Minchan returned, he would hand down a strict disciplinary action. It happened when he was having such thoughts.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Uh?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The barrier being filmed by the broadcasting camera disappeared, and Woojin walked out. Park-sahngoh abruptly stood up from his seat.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;This is nuts.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">He soloed a 5 star Dungeon?</span></p><p><span style="">It was possible. Park-sahngoh was confident he could do it. However, he was a Rank A Roused. Wasn&#x2019;t the other person a Rank C? No. He was able to become a Rank C, because Jung-minchan adjusted the Rank from the middle.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Is he a Rank A?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">This Roused wasn&#x2019;t at all like Park-jinwoo where his potential had to be unearthed. This person was already a completed product.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;This is crazy.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Was Jung-minchan&#x2019;s intuition correct?</span></p><p><span style="">He saw Minchan on the broadcast. He hurriedly protected Woojin&#x2019;s identity. They got on a car, then they quickly drove off.</span></p><p><span style="">Park-sahngoh made a fist.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes! I knew team leader Jung would succeed.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Jung-minchan was about to reel in the 3rd Rank A Roused for the Hammer guild.</span></p><p><span style="">*</span></p><p><span style="">Hwarang guild&#x2019;s Master Lee-sahngho was sighing as he read over the investigative report prepared by the Support department.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;How confident are you on this report?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;About 70%.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hmmm.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Lee-sahngho frowned.</span></p><p><span style="">A Roused named Kang-woojin was the subject of this investigation.</span></p><p><span style="">The conclusion from the investigation was written in this report.</span></p><p><span style="">The Roused was secretly grown by the Hammer guild. He had disappeared for 5 years, but there weren&#x2019;t any conclusive evidence as to whether he really disappeared or not. He became active only recently, and he hadn&#x2019;t tried to raise his Roused Rank. He had been working as a Rank C.</span></p><p><span style="">Moreover, he cut in line in front of the Vermillion team, who had arrived first at the Dungeon.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Didn&#x2019;t he just ignore the queue?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin was the very first person to write his name for the queue. However, he was a Rank C Roused. He didn&#x2019;t have the right. His attempt at the Dungeon broke the rules.</span></p><p><span style="">He entered the Dungeon using an accident as an excuse. He basically worked around the rules? He also risked going in solo? Moreover, he did this while revealing his identity as a secretly cultivated Roused?</span></p><p><span style="">The Hammer guild did this to take a mere 5 star Dungeon?</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;It just doesn&#x2019;t add up. The Hammer guild is currently struggling to shut the reporters from talking. Couldn&#x2019;t we draw a conclusion from this fact?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Hammer guild wanted to keep Woojin&#x2019;s identity a secret.</span></p><p><span style="">The Support team leader, who had made the report, furrowed his brows.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;If he isn&#x2019;t affiliated with the Hammer guild, then his skill can&#x2019;t be explained.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;That&#x2019;s correct. It can&#x2019;t be explained. If a person could become a Rank A just from completing 4 Dungeons, then couple hundred Rank A would exist.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;That&#x2019;s true.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Please investigate him again. Please approach the investigation as if he was free. Please look at it as a possibility.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The Support team leader thought hard on it before he spoke.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;President. There is one way we can find out his affiliation.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Lee-sahngho&#x2019;s ears perked up.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What is it?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Mr. Kang-woojin is still an incomplete.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;&#x2026;!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Lee-sahngho&#x2019;s round eyes turned into a crescent shape, then he smiled.</span></p><p><span style="">Of course, if they used that method, then they would be able to accurately dig up Woojin&#x2019;s affiliation.</span></p><p><span style="">*</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Pooh-haha. I really like that part.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Haha. You are so funny, hyung-nim.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Jaemin frowned since he couldn&#x2019;t focus on his study in this environment. He turned his head to see them laughing their heads off at the comedy program. Sunggoo, Woojin and the cat&#x2026; Uh? Why is a cat laughing like that?</span></p><p><span style="">Maybe this cat has some self-awareness?</span></p><p><span style="">As he looked at them, Jaemin couldn&#x2019;t stop himself from speaking.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I&#x2019;m studying for test, so couldn&#x2019;t you turn down the volume?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;All right. All right.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin half-heartedly pressed the button on the remote, and a single bar of volume went down.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hehe. I&#x2019;m sorry, student Jaemin.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ha-ah.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Jaemin let out a deep sigh.</span></p><p><span style="">Why did this house become an inn for those youths with nowhere to go?</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hyung. Aren&#x2019;t you guys worried?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ah haha. About what?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin gave a half-hearted answer as his eyes never left the tv.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;It&#x2019;s been 3 days since the reporters started blanketing outside.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Jaemin&#x2019;s voice was filled with exhaustion.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;They&#x2019;ll start to get tired of me, then they&#x2019;ll enventually disappear.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">There were a lot less reporters compared to the first day. However, that wasn&#x2019;t the problem.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hyung. Haven&#x2019;t you seen the internet? They are making a huge ruckus about the person who soloed a 5 star Dungeon. I know it was hyung.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I guess I&#x2019;m famous now.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Jaemin shook his head from side-to-side at Woojin&#x2019;s apathetic answer.</span></p><p><span style="">There were several dozens of speculative articles written about Woojin every day before it got buried.</span></p><p><span style="">[The veiled Roused, KangXX. What is his identity?]</span></p><p><span style="">[Hammer guild&#x2019;s secret Roused.]</span></p><p><span style="">There were all kinds of speculative reporting rampant everywhere, yet how can the people directly involved be so relaxed?</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin was annoyed at Jaemin, who kept talking to him. So he brought out his wallet.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ah. I&#x2019;m in an inconvenient situation, so I can&#x2019;t eve go out right now. That being said could you go out an buy some tangerines?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Student Jaemin. Please buy two bags.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Hul. These hyungs looked frighteningly more relaxed than me? Furthermore, I&#x2019;m the one who is being inconvenienced. He was damn uncomfortable right now.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hyung. It&#x2019;s my testing period.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;You can have the leftover money as a tip for shopping for me.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin took out $50 bill and he waved it around. Jaemin had a sullen expression as he glared at the money. Then he stood up from his chare/</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Do you need anything else?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Student Jaemin. I want a Melona.&#x201D; (TLN: ice cream)</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I want a Wonder cone.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Nyahh, Nyahhng.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;&#x2026;.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin immediately raised the volume as soon as Jaemin left.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hyung-nim. Aren&#x2019;t we being too much of a bother to student Jaemin?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Haha. Where else are we going to go? Everywhere we go the reporters are following us.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The reporters had even come looking for them at their home, and they were making life difficult for their family members. This was why the two of them had escaped to Jaemin&#x2019;s house. It had already been 3 days, but the undercover reporters were still hanging around where they stayed. They couldn&#x2019;t even go to a Dungeon, so they were just staying inside Jaemin&#x2019;s one room.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Also, hyung-him. Are you really going to keep turning down the Hammer guild&#x2019;s offer?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Uh. Why?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Ah, it was a great opportunity.</span></p><p><span style="">They don&#x2019;t give the vice president seat to just anyone&#x2026;.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Whew. It&#x2019;s nothing, hyung-nim.&#x201C;</span></p><p><span style="">Ddi-ri-ri-ri..</span></p><p><span style="">At that moment, Woojin&#x2019;s hand phone started ringing, so he answered it.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes, mother. Are the reporters still showing up? Yes. What?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin, who had been lying down on his side as he watched tv, suddenly sat up.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;They still send those things out?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Sunggoo was curious to know what was said on the phone. What made Woojin so surprised?</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Whew. I understad. If I have the chance later, I&#x2019;ll go pick it up.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hyung-nim. What&#x2019;s going on?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Sunggoo asked the question as soon as Woojin ended the call.</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin&#x2019;s face turned as serious as Sunggoo had ever seen.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Sunggoo.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes, hyung-nim.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Did our countries unify yet?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Not yet.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Why not?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;&#x2026;.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">If he knew the answer to that question, then he would be the Minister of Unification. Why would he be sitting here?</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin pressed firmly on his temple.</span></p><p><span style="">His draft notice had come.</span></p><p><span style="">It had been 5 years since the Dungeon had formed, but this damn country was still divided.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hey, Sunggoo. You should come with me to Pyongyang.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What? Why would we go there?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Let&#x2019;s go kill Kim-jungil.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What? Kim-jungil has been dead for awhile&#x2026;.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What? He&#x2019;s dead yet the countries aren&#x2019;t united?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;His son took over.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;&#x2026;.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;&#x2026;.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">After thinking over it for a moment, Woojin spoke again.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Then let&#x2019;s go kill that son of a bitch.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin was looking at Sunggoo with a serious face, so he knew Woojin wasn&#x2019;t making a joke at his expense. So he sobered up.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hyung-nim. What&#x2019;s causing you to act this way?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;My draft notice was issued.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;&#x2026;.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Sunggoo&#x2019;s expression turned serious. Woojin abruptly stood up.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;H&#x2026;hyung-nim.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Let&#x2019;s go! Let&#x2019;s unite the country. Let&#x2019;s unite it before I have to join the army.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;H&#x2026;hyung-nim. Please calm down. Do you really think both countries will immediately unite just from killing that person?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Why not? It&#x2019;ll work.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;It won&#x2019;t.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin sat down in despair when he heard Sunggoo&#x2019;s words.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ha-ah.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">What era were they in? Why was the compulsory military service still a thing?</span></p><p><span style="">Sunggoo seriously thought about the situation alongside Woojin, when a thought suddenly came to him.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ah, hyung-nim!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;When a Roused goes to the army, they are assigned to a special division.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Why?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;They are the first ones to be mobilized to the station when the Dungeon Break erupts&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;So what?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;There is a way you could do the same work without entering the army.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Explain it so I can easily understand it.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Sunggoo had dropped out of school, so his draft notice would also be coming soon. This was why Sunggoo had done some research on the army, so Sunggoo was well informed on this subject.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;It is like working for the public interest. You don&#x2019;t enter the army, but when the military asks for help, you have to cooperate with them to suppress the monsters.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Oh! So how do I apply for it?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;This option is only available for the Roused who are verified as being a member of a guild.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Mmmm.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Sunggo slyly spoke to Woojin, who was racking his brain.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Why don&#x2019;t you use this opportunity to join a guild?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hmm.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin thought about it.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Should I secretly enter Pyongyang for an assassination?&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">He didn&#x2019;t want to join a guild in the first place, so entering one wasn&#x2019;t even an option. Then Woojin suddenly had a good idea.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hey, Sunggoo.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes, hyung-nim.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Let&#x2019;s make a guild.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin put on a satisfied smile.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Get ready to establish a guild.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">He didn&#x2019;t want to bow his head to enter a guild. So he&#x2019;ll just make a new one. It&#x2019;s just a guild, so he could probably half-ass it when he made one.</span></p><p></p></div><p></p>
