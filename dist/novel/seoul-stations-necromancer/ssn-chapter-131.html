<p><span style="">Chapter 131 - Bloody Reunion</span></p><p><span style="">The Dimensional Domain of Alandal was developing quickly as each day passed.</span></p><p><span style="">When the territory taken from Liah was added, Alandal&apos;s size had increased by 10%. &#xA0;Moreover, the Mercenary guild and the Goblin Research Facility was put in place.</span></p><p><span style="">When one exited Woojin&apos;s castle on top of the mountain, one immediately entered the street for commerce.</span></p><p><span style="">There was quite a lot of variety of stores on the street. &#xA0;It wasn&apos;t crowded, but the place was very lively.</span></p><p><span style="">The profit earned from the commerce buildings was slowly raising the Domain&apos;s Dungeon Energy.</span></p><p><span style="">After exiting this street, the mountain road had houses of the Domain residents interspersed along the way. &#xA0;If one traveled down the road a little bit more, the military facilities were built next to each other. &#xA0;Then there were the additional land that had been added to the Domain, where the refugees were staying.</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin didn&apos;t have to go to Jaemin&apos;s house to meet him.</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin was about to walk past the cafe when he came to a stop.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Uh? What are you doing here?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Woojin tilted his head in confusion when he saw a teen sitting at the terrace of a cafe.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;You are back, hyung?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Woojin sat in the seat opposite of Jaemin. &#xA0;He quickly surveyed the place. &#xA0;The place was way more modern compared to the pub where the Death Knights played their card games. </span></p><p><span style="">It seemed someone missed the modern sensibilities...</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Did you build this?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes. &#xA0;I helped Butler Bibi choose the design. It seems there are numerous planets that has similar tastes as earth.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">There were several thousand variety of buildings one could buy in the Dimensional Store.</span></p><p><span style="">For some reason, there were numerous items from earth present in the Achievement Store, but there were none in the Dimensional Store. &#xA0;It only had Items that were similar to the ones found on earth.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Is it related to the fact that this place hasn&apos;t synchronized fully with earth?&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">There were still the four times the time difference between earth and the other dimensions.</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin only needed 30 days to link to Planet Jaku through Necia&apos;s Pillar. &#xA0;However, if he wanted to purchase a Dungeon on earth, he would need 120 days to link to earth.</span></p><p><span style="">There was 0 time difference between his Dungeon and the Planet Jaku. &#xA0;Earth still had a time difference of four times with the Dungeon.</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin looked at the coffee Jaemin was drinking.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Does it taste similar to the ones on earth? &#xA0;Over here.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Woojin raised his hand to call over the employee working within the cafe. &#xA0;The girl had cat ears, and she was of the anthropomorphic race. She approached Woojin, and when she saw his face, she lowered her head in surprise.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I give my greetings to you, lord.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes. Just give me one of that.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Y...you want to drink that?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Huh? What is it?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Woojin turned to look at Jaemin. &#xA0;Jaemin was laughing awkwardly.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;It&apos;s blood.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Blood?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes. I tried various blood, but the human blood is the tastiest. &#xA0;I don&apos;t have the courage to personally harm others... &#xA0;They sell it for cheap here.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;they really do sell all kinds of things here. May you bring me a cup of coffee?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes, lord.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">The girl of the anthropomorphic race wore a pretty uniform with frills on it. &#xA0;She gave a bow, and she entered the cafe. &#xA0;There were tables clustered together on the terrace, and it was an ideal place to watch the people walking the streets.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Isn&apos;t it strange?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Jaemin liked to sit in the cafe. &#xA0;It was party of his daily life to watch the streets, which had a peaceful and lazy atmosphere about it.</span></p><p><span style="">In the beginning, there weren&apos;t a lot of people here, but there were over 400 beings here even if one excluded the military forces.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What&apos;s strange?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I just can&apos;t believe such a world exists.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Woojin leaned back into his chair, and he looked out onto the street. &#xA0;At the very least, the anthropomorphic race resembled humans. &#xA0;He saw orcs, and occasionally, a large troll walked by. &#xA0;There were also the Naga race, whose lower body consisted of a tail of a large snake...</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;It feels like I&apos;m visiting a Halloween parade in the US. It sometimes feel like I&apos;m visiting a movie set.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hmm.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Woojin sat still as he looked at Jaemin. Jaemin&apos;s face was a bit paler than before, but the sickly air that had been around him was gone. &#xA0;The atmosphere around him had also brightened significantly. </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Do you feel like living now?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I guess I just got used to everything now.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Woojin smirked. &#xA0;Jaemin&apos;s words were correct. &#xA0;In the end, everyone adapted to the situation.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;When are you going to go see your noonah?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I was going to ask you about it once hyung arrived. When are you returning to earth?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;If you ask Bibi, she will open a portal to the Seoul Station&#x2019;s 1st Exit for you. &#xA0;Just ask her whenever you want to return.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hoo. &#xA0;I guess I have to buy a pair of sunglasses.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Woojin couldn&apos;t hold back his laughter.</span></p><p><span style="">Night and day didn&apos;t matter in the Dimensional Domain. &#xA0;However, Jaemin wouldn&apos;t be able to see the sun on earth. &#xA0;All of his skin would be burned to a crisp </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;So what&apos;s up with the Dimensional Battle? Did you play a little bit of Warcraft before?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;A little bit. &#xA0;I wasn&apos;t able to play it when I became a senior in highschool.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;If you are bored, do you want to try the Dimensional Battle?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Me?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Can&apos;t you just use a pro-gamer?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I could, but why would I trust someone else?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Of course, there probably was a Roused pro-gamer, who could enter his Dungeon.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;You can lose. &#xA0;I don&apos;t care about the wins and losses.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Woojin&apos;s aim wasn&apos;t to rise up in the Rankings.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hmm. &#xA0;Is that so? &#xA0;Well, that&apos;ll be great for me. &#xA0;I heard from Butler Bibi that you give her points for winning? &#xA0;She boast a lot about it.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;mmm. &#xA0;I&apos;ll also give you the points.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Bibi might be too greedy about the points, and she might insist on playing. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">Still, he didn&apos;t care if they won or not. &#xA0;He could get his money&apos;s worth through the Revenge....</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;The next Dimensional Battle is in 4 days. &#xA0;We can spend a day on earth. &#xA0;Do you want to go see your sister?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes, I will.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Jaemin picked up his cup on the table, and he downed the remaining blood. &#xA0;After drinking it, there was a red bloodstain near his mouth. &#xA0;He licked at his lips as if he wanted more.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ha-ah..&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">He struggled mightily to keep his composure, but Jaemin&apos;s eyes shook as he tried to suppress the sense of ecstasy he felt whenever he drank blood. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Let&apos;s go.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Jaemin immediately regained his wits, and he stood up from his seat. &#xA0;At that moment, the girl from the anthropomorphic race brought Woojin a cup of a coffee.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Your coffee is here, my lord.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Mmm. &#xA0;Let&apos;s leave after I drink this.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Woojin leisure sipped at his coffee, and Jaemin sat back down once again.</span></p><p><span style="">*** </span></p><p><span style="">Alandal&apos;s Housing Complex. </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes. &#xA0;It&apos;s 7 PM tonight? &#xA0;Yes. &#xA0;Woojin won&apos;t be able to go. &#xA0;Yes. &#xA0;He&apos;s busy.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Jiwon ended the call, and she looked at her watch.</span></p><p><span style="">It was 9 in the morning.</span></p><p><span style="">There was still a lot of time left until the appointed time, so Jiwon decided to take a shower.</span></p><p><span style="">Shwahhhhh. </span></p><p><span style="">It had been a long time since she had went out.</span></p><p><span style="">The country of Alandal was in the process of gaining independence from Korea. However, Alandal hadn&apos;t finalized its treaty with Korea, so the border situation was a bit ambiguous. Therefore, people were allowed to travel freely between the two countries.</span></p><p><span style="">Even if the two countries came to an agreement, it would be possible for people to travel freely between Korea and Alandal.</span></p><p><span style="">However, there were several radical religious organizations and advocacy groups that protested the change near Alandal. &#xA0;As a precaution against potential danger, a lot of security personnel had to travel with the members of Alandal.</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin&apos;s family and Do-jiwon, who was known to be his girlfriend, was under extra protection.</span></p><p><span style="">She wasn&apos;t anyone special, yet she had to drag around several dozen guards. She felt like she was causing inconvenience for people, so she chose to seclude herself.</span></p><p><span style="">She had fun watching Che-haesol train her new monsters, and she wrote her own novels. &#xA0;She wasn&apos;t lonely, but it did feel suffocating.</span></p><p><span style="">This school reunion party was an outing she had been looking forward to.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ha-ah. &#xA0;It would have been great if Woojin went too.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">It wouldn&apos;t be false to say that this school reunion party had been planned, because of Kahng-woojin.</span></p><p><span style="">He had become the most famous person on earth, so it wasn&apos;t an exaggeration to say that most of the graduates would be showing up to see Woojin.</span></p><p><span style="">Even Cindy, who had never came to a high school reunion after she became a celebrity, was coming.</span></p><p><span style="">It didn&apos;t matter what they want, since Kahng-woojin was too busy right now.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hmmm.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">After her shower, she put on a towel, and she was surprised when she exited the bathroom. &#xA0;An unexpected person was sitting on the living room&apos;s sofa.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;It&apos;s been awhile, noonah.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Jaemin awkwardly got up, and he raised his hand.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ha ha.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Jiwon placed both her hands on her surprised face. &#xA0;Soon her round eyes started to mist up.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Jaemin-ah!&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">She ran towards her dongsaeng, and she hugged him tight. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">Was it because of the soft objects touching him? &#xA0;Or was it because her towel was in a precarious situation of coming undone?</span></p><p><span style="">Jaemin&apos;s face became red.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ooh-ook, noonah.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hoo-hook, hook. &#xA0;It&apos;s all right. &#xA0;It&apos;s all right. &#xA0;Your noonah will understand everything.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">He didn&apos;t know what there was to understand.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Noonah. &#xA0;Just let me go and....&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Who cares if you are a vampire? &#xA0;You are still the same person. &#xA0;Noonah won&apos;t throw you away. &#xA0;Hoo-hoohk. &#xA0;Are you eating properly? &#xA0;Look how white your face is.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Jiwon grabbed Jaemin&apos;s face, and she turned his head this way and that way to inspect him.</span></p><p><span style="">It had been strenuous for her as she had be worried about her tormented dongsaeng... &#xA0;Why was his face so pale and gaunt?</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Noonah. &#xA0;This a bit...&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Jaemin grabbed the shower towel that was about to fall off. &#xA0;Was it because he was her dongsaeng? &#xA0;She didn&apos;t show much embarrassment as she readjusted her towel.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hoo-oohk. &#xA0;All right.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Woojin-hyung is also here...&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Jaemin&apos;s face unnecessarily got redder from embarrassment.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Huh?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Jiwon thought she had misheard him. &#xA0;She was about to turn her head around when her body froze. &#xA0;Woojin was sitting on the sofa with a grin on his face. </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;You body is also very pretty.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;&#x2026;.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">The only thing that could be seen was the gap showing the side of her body, but...</span></p><p><span style="">Jiwon&apos;s face turned red, and she backed away from them. Woojin smiled as he saw her silently disappear into her dressing room. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Why&apos;s your noonah acting that way?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Don&apos;t ask me.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Is he really asking because he didn&#x2019;t know? &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">Jaemin shook his head from side to side.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;It was a very beautiful brother and sister reunion.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Are you heading out?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I don&apos;t have any time to rest. &#xA0;I&apos;m returning to the Dungeon.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;it isn&apos;t as if you need more money. &#xA0;Why are you so diligent in going to the Dungeons?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Woojin possessed a Dimensional Domain. &#xA0;Jaemin had some understanding about the change the world was going through. &#xA0;The Dungeons were locations where one went to earn regular Bloodstones. &#xA0;On earth, the Bloodstone were worth money. &#xA0;In the Domain, the Bloodstone could be converted to points.</span></p><p><span style="">Jaemin wasn&#x2019;t fully knowledgeable about Woojin&apos;s situation, so this was a mystery to him.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Level Up.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Level Up?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Woojin waved his hand as he started to exit the room. &#xA0;Jaemin tilted his head in confusion.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;If you are trying to level up... That means you still have more room to grow?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">He was already so strong, yet he was still challenging the Dungeons.... &#xA0;His diligence was probably the reason why he became so strong.</span></p><p><span style="">*** </span></p><p><span style="">An exit formed within the deep emptiness.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Ooh-oohk.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">Enough time had passed that he had lost his sense of self. &#xA0;As the light from the exit approached him, his old memories started to surface.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;I want to live.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">The light from the exit surrounded his entire body, and he regained his self that he had lost.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;I don&apos;t want to die again.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">After a very long time had passed, Lee-sahngho had finally been revived from his death.</span></p><p><span style="">He was lying flat on the floor of a familiar Ice Castle.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Useless bastard.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;&#x2026;.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Lee-sahngho&apos;s body was trembling.</span></p><p><span style="">Iello spent his precious points to revive this bastard. &#xA0;He looked down with an expression of &#xA0;displeasure on his face.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I have a task for you.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;J...just leave it to me. &#xA0;This time I won&apos;t make any mistake in causing the Breaks....&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Stupid bastard!&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Lee-sahngho&#x2019;s earnest words was caught off by Iello&#x2019;s roar.</span></p><p><span style="">He couldn&apos;t cause Dungeon Breaks like before.</span></p><p><span style="">When he experienced death and revival, he ceased to be a &apos;Roused from Earth&apos;. Now he was solely the vassal of Iello, who was the 25th Great Dimensional lord.</span></p><p><span style="">Lee-sahngho no longer had &apos;Roots&apos; on earth.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I want you to take this to Planet Jaku.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">A ring floated up in front of Iello, and it came to rest in front of Lee-sahngho. &#xA0;He respectfully took it with two hands.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What should I do with this?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Find Rajakui, and deliver a message for me.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Please favor me with your order.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;If he can destroy Earth, I&apos;ll allow him entrance into Planet Iefrin.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Lee-sahngho had no idea what those words meant. &#xA0;However, he was tasked to deliver the message, so he would.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I&apos;ll deliver those exact words to him.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Also, go to earth instead of coming back here. &#xA0;You should sow dissent amongst the people of earth.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;how will I be able to travel to earth?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Wear the ring.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;&#x2026;.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Lee-sahngho opened his hand. An unknown magic could be felt emanating from the item. &#xA0;He slowly put on the Polymorph ring.</span></p>
