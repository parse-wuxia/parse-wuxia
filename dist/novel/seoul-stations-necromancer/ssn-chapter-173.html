<p>Chapter 173 - Air Strike (2)</p><p><span style="">Woojin looked over the hologram of the Bibi&apos;s Castle, and he nodded his head in satisfaction. &#xA0;Bibi was doing a good job by herself, so it seemed he wouldn&apos;t have to worry too much about it.</span></p><p><span style="">Investments were great, but it would be bad if all his Points were used. &#xA0;He wouldn&apos;t be able to replenish his troops, and he wouldn&apos;t be able to maintain his Domain. Many Dimensional lords lost their Domains through mismanagement.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;You keep this up even into the future. &#xA0;You have to protect the Colony no matter what.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">However, this was for his family. &#xA0;Moreover, his return to earth hinged on the existence of the Colony.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Understood.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin was about to get up.</span></p><p><span style="">Bibi yelled out when she saw the Hologram window.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Uh? Master. &#xA0;Another Dungeon just broke.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">As soon as her words ended, one could hear urgent steps as two people appeared.</span></p><p><span style="">One was the captain of the aircraft carrier, Park-gilsoo. &#xA0;The other was Nosam, who was in charge of maintenance and design. </span></p><p><span style="">&quot;It is good to see you, king!&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I give my greetings to the lord.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">The two had hastily appeared, and Woojin turned his head towards them.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Can we see what&apos;s going on below?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Yes, sir!&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Park-gilsoo immediately used the screen within the control tower to bring up the map of the region below. &#xA0;When he zoomed in with the screen, one could see a live high-resolution footage.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Is that three locations?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Jung-minchan still had a dark expression as he returned to the control tower. &#xA0;He spoke to Woojin in a weak voice.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Recently, there&apos;s been numerous Dungeon Breaks. &#xA0;There was no warning before they broke. &#xA0;At the very least, Korea is in a better situation than the other locations.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Other locations?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;The subjugation of the enemy forces never exceeded a day in Korea. &#xA0;However, several countries had monsters take over key buildings several hours before they besieged it.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin&apos;s eyebrows arched.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Did another Colony form on earth?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Not yet. &#xA0;However, there had been intermittent attempts to form one.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;What are you talking about?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;There are some in China, who are aiding the formation of a Colony.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Why?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;This is just a guess, but it seems they want to harvest the Dimensional Fragments.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Tsk.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin clicked his tongue as he closed his eyes.</span></p><p><span style="">He had already predicted this would happen. &#xA0;People talked about world peace and the protection of earth, but humans moved based on greed. In the end, they&apos;ll find out it was futile to eat one&apos;s own flesh.</span></p><p><span style="">He wanted to protect earth, so he could protect his family. &#xA0;He was also motivated by his own self-interest....</span></p><p><span style="">He felt that he didn&apos;t have much time left.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I guess I&apos;ll have to take care what is going on below.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Master is busy. &#xA0;Please leave it to me!&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;You?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">It had been a long time since Bibi had accompanied him to the battlefield. &#xA0;This was why her level was still low. &#xA0;If she unnecessarily went forward to subjugate the monsters, she might get hurt.....</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I just have to attack with the Colony City.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Ah...&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin nodded his head. &#xA0;This was a moving Colony City.</span></p><p><span style="">He had decided on putting a Colony on an aircraft carrier, so they could escape from attacks they couldn&apos;t handle. &#xA0;Unexpectedly, the aircraft carrier was able to traverse the sky instead of the ocean.</span></p><p><span style="">The weapons and troops placed the aircraft carrier wasn&apos;t only for battle on sea. &#xA0;Now it would be able to be used to attack the the enemies from the sky.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;That&apos;s a pretty good idea.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;May I be in charge of it?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;All right. &#xA0;I&apos;ll leave it up to you.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">The unexpected Dungeon Breaks would continue to happen. &#xA0;Woojin couldn&apos;t take care of all of them.</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin had to do the deeds that only he could do.</span></p><p><span style="">&apos;Thrash&apos;s Executioner.&apos;</span></p><p><span style="">He had to solve this puzzle.</span></p><p><span style="">If he wanted to solve it, he had to regain his Thrash Set items. &#xA0;It might give him a clue that he could follow.</span></p><p><span style="">He had to be in Alphen instead of earth.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Bibi.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Yes, master!&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;No matter what you do, don&apos;t lose the Colony.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Leave it to me!&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">He rubbed Bibi&apos;s head once more, then he passed through the portal as he headed towards Alphen.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Hue hue. &#xA0;Let&apos;s get started.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Bibi laughed as she looked at the screen showing what was going on below the control tower.</span></p><p><span style="">***</span></p><p><span style="">They were at a snack shop near the Daejun Station.</span></p><p><span style="">Three high school students were eating stir-fried rice cake near the subway station. &#xA0;They expressed their admiration as they saw a nearby group of Roused.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Hooo. &#xA0;My life would turn around if I Roused to an ability.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Pfft. &#xA0;Why are you talking about becoming a Roused? &#xA0;You should buy a lottery ticket instead. &#xA0;The probability of you winning is higher than you becoming a Roused.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Bitch. &#xA0;You never know in life. &#xA0;Gyungsoo from class 4 became a Roused.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I guess you have a point.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">If a student developed abilities to become a Roused, it was a lucky break that even a winning lottery ticket couldn&apos;t rival.</span></p><p><span style="">There was no man that didn&apos;t have ambition. &#xA0;Moreover, there wasn&apos;t a teen, who didn&apos;t have heroic aspirations.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Hey. &#xA0;The low Rank Roused are basically manual laborers.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Why do you think they are called 3rd rate?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">A low Ranked Roused was basically akin to an unpopular celebrity.</span></p><p><span style="">However, there wasn&apos;t anyone, who didn&apos;t want a chance to become a star. &#xA0;It didn&apos;t matter if it took backbreaking work.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Ah. &#xA0;If we are able to developed an ability, we can interview at Alandal. &#xA0;They only picked the lousy candidates.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Well, that might be a cover for who they really chose.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;That&apos;s right. &#xA0;Alandal isn&apos;t some factory. &#xA0;You don&apos;t suddenly become a high Ranked Roused in a short span of time. &#xA0;That doesn&apos;t make any sense.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">However, there was an obvious reasoning that could explain their actions. &#xA0;What if they hired Roused with potential? &#xA0;Maybe they just allowed the flowers to bloom?</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I guess...&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Minjae&apos;s dream was to become a Roused, so he just scratched his cheeks.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Hey. &#xA0;You are good at studying, so why are you trying to become a Roused?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Unlike the past, education wasn&apos;t the absolute ticket to success. &#xA0;However, it was still the most basic requirement needed to advance in life.</span></p><p><span style="">In a world gone mad with monsters, the need for education was that much more important.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Hoo-ooh. &#xA0;Let&apos;s just go to cramming school after we eat.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Minjae and his friends inhaled their stir-fried rice cake and other fried foods. &#xA0;They were about to leave the restaurant when they stopped at the entrance. &#xA0;No, they froze in place.</span></p><p><span style="">Koo-roo-roo!</span></p><p><span style="">Monsters were a regular part of life now.</span></p><p><span style="">However, what would it feel like if one faced a monster that one had only seen through tv?</span></p><p><span style="">Koo-oh-oh!</span></p><p><span style="">The enormous monster held something that looked like a hammer or a steel club. &#xA0;It was about to bring the weapon down.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;R...run!&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Minjae was barely able to open his frozen lips. His shout was like a catalyst that made his friends move.</span></p><p><span style="">Koohng, koohng!</span></p><p><span style="">The enormous monster was domineering, but it was pretty slow. &#xA0;Minjae and his friends ran as if their life depended on it, and they were able to distance themselves from the monster.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Huhk, huhk! What&apos;s going on?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;The nearby Dungeon must have Broke.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Where&apos;s the shelter?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Hooo. &#xA0;I have no idea. &#xA0;I must have dropped my phone.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">The three of them had been lucky. &#xA0;This was the first time they had encountered a monster. &#xA0;While they were looking around in panic, more monsters appeared.</span></p><p><span style="">Koo-roo-roohk.</span></p><p><span style="">A Break just happened, so there was no way only one monster would have shown up.</span></p><p><span style="">Four other monsters that had a similar appearance to the one before appeared.</span></p><p><span style="">The three humans weren&apos;t able to escape, because of fear. &#xA0;The monsters surrounded them.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;F...fuck.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;....&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">His friends didn&apos;t even have the energy to give a reply to Minjae&apos;s curse word. The Break had happened recently, and they hadn&apos;t been able to find a shelter. &#xA0;They were now preys that&#x2019;ll be hunted down by these monsters.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;We are fucked.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Hey, Minjae. &#xA0;What should we do?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;What do you think? &#xA0;We&apos;ll just die.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">It was funny. &#xA0;When he realized he was about to die, he became more composed instead of being afraid. &#xA0;In the end, he was going to die, so why should he be afraid?</span></p><p><span style="">When he put aside his fear, he was able to take in his surrounding.</span></p><p><span style="">&apos;The army isn&apos;t here yet. &#xA0;We are the only ones nearby.&apos;</span></p><p><span style="">It seemed the army hadn&apos;t been mobilized yet. &#xA0;The sound of gunfire didn&apos;t reach his ears, and he couldn&apos;t hear any sounds of battle. &#xA0;He could only hear the scream of people, and the roar of monsters.</span></p><p><span style="">It seemed the Break happened not too long ago.</span></p><p><span style="">There were only four monsters right now, but the numbers would swell. &#xA0;The chance of their survival was non-existent.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;We are dead.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;M...Minjae. &#xA0;What should we do?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Why do you keep asking me that?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Ooh-ohhk.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Minjae wanted it with all his heart.</span></p><p><span style="">If he had an ability, he could use his own powers to either fight or run away. &#xA0;However, he was only a regular high school student, who had been about to go to his supplemental class.</span></p><p><span style="">What will they say about him in death?</span></p><p><span style="">Unfortunately, he had stopped near the Daejun station, because he was hungry. &#xA0;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">It seemed eating stir-fried rice cake was going to be his downfall.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Shit.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">He wished with all his heart. &#xA0;&#xA0;If he really was a Roused, he wouldn&apos;t be powerless like this.</span></p><p><span style="">He felt like a frog in front of a snake.</span></p><p><span style="">Kwahhhh!</span></p><p><span style="">The monsters kept tightening the perimeter, and they were about to bring down their large weapons.</span></p><p><span style="">They would die as a bloody mess. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Shit!&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">He grabbed the hands of both his friends in fright. &#xA0;If this was a normal situation, his friends would have balked at such a gesture.</span></p><p><span style="">Pah-paht!</span></p><p><span style="">A miracle occurred.</span></p><p><span style="">Teeeng!</span></p><p><span style="">An unknown power blocked the weapons, and the weapons were bounced away in midair.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;....!&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Minjae&apos;s eyes was big from surprise.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;M...Minjae!&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;W...what the hell was that? Did you see it?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;What happened?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Minjae didn&#x2019;t even register the shocked words of his friends. &#xA0;Minjae knew what was going on.</span></p><p><span style="">&apos;I became a Roused.&apos;</span></p><p><span style="">He could feel it. &#xA0;No, a thought suddenly intruded into his mind. &#xA0;It was the knowledge on how to use his barrier.</span></p><p><span style="">Koo-roohk?</span></p><p><span style="">The confused monsters swung their weapons again.</span></p><p><span style="">Teeng!</span></p><p><span style="">A loud roar emanated from the monsters when the barrier formed again.</span></p><p><span style="">Koo-ahah!</span></p><p><span style="">If there was an impediment, they&apos;ll just have to break through it.</span></p><p><span style="">Kwahng, kwahng!</span></p><p><span style="">The weapons were tirelessly striking against the barrier, and it wouldn&apos;t last much longer.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Ooh-oohk.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">It felt as if the pain would break open his head. &#xA0;He frowned as he gritted his teeth. &#xA0;If he couldn&apos;t withstand the blows, they were all dead.</span></p><p><span style="">He was finally able to develop an ability, yet he was going to die in futility....</span></p><p><span style="">Kieh-ahhhhk!</span></p><p><span style="">Minjae let out words of defeat when he heard the sound coming from the sky.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;In the end, am I fated to die?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">The sky was dyed black as black birds plummeted to the ground.</span></p><p><span style="">He had seen them in the news. It was also a monster that appeared in the national bestseller called Illustrated Monster book.</span></p><p><span style="">Wyvern.</span></p><p><span style="">They were popular, but it didn&apos;t mean they were nice monsters. &#xA0;They were scary monsters that could bite off a person&apos;s head with a bite.</span></p><p><span style="">He had no defense against this.</span></p><p><span style="">He could see over 100 Wyverns.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Hoo-ah.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Tuh-uhng!</span></p><p><span style="">The barrier exploded.</span></p><p><span style="">His shaking body was evidence that he had reached his limit. &#xA0;He couldn&apos;t use his Roused ability any further.</span></p><p><span style="">The monsters approached the fallen Minjae and his friends when the monsters were pulled into the air.</span></p><p><span style="">Kee-ahhhhk!</span></p><p><span style="">The Wyverns had snatched the four monsters, and they were dropped from high in the air.</span></p><p><span style="">Hwah-rooh-oohk, kwahng!</span></p><p><span style="">It wasn&apos;t just the Wyvern. &#xA0;There were weird looking people riding the Wyverns, and they were using magic.</span></p><p><span style="">They started sending their magical spells towards the monsters that had started gathering.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;W...what is going on?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Minjae had no idea what was going on. &#xA0;He had run away like a madman before he was surrounded by the monsters. &#xA0;He had awoken to his Roused ability and now the Wyverns were dropping from the sky....</span></p><p><span style="">Then there were the mob of monsters gathering up along all the roads.</span></p><p><span style="">A Wyvern landed near Minjae and his friends. &#xA0;It was a Wyvern Rider from the Ratick Race. &#xA0;He had blue skin, and large ear flaps.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;This is a rescue. Get on.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Unlike his bizarre appearance, the Rider was able to speak flawless Korean thanks to the Language drug. &#xA0;Minjae and his friends quickly got on the back of the Wyvern.</span></p><p><span style="">Kee-ahhhk!</span></p><p><span style="">The Wyvern flew into the air, and the high schoolers desperately held on.</span></p><p><span style="">Hwah-roo-roohk, kwahng!</span></p><p><span style="">Each of the Wyverns had one or two Ratick Riders, and they were tirelessly sending magical spells towards the ground.</span></p><p><span style="">Then several artillery shells that looked like missiles impacted below.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;...&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Minjae gulped when he glance below.</span></p><p><span style="">&apos;I thought my luck had been bad. &#xA0;I guess that wasn&apos;t the case.&apos;</span></p><p><span style="">He had thought he had experienced bad luck when the monsters had found him.</span></p><p><span style="">Hwah-roo-roohk.</span></p><p><span style="">However, the burning city below told a different story.</span></p><p><span style="">He and his friends were the few remaining survivors from the city.</span></p><p><span style="">Each road in the city was overflowing with monsters.</span></p><p><span style="">****</span></p><p><span style="">It was a cave completely frozen in ice.</span></p><p><span style="">Kwahng! Zzuh-juh-juhk!</span></p><p><span style="">When the enraged Iello paced back and forth. &#xA0;The ice cracked as the whole cave started to shake. &#xA0;Lee-sahngho was shaking with his knees bent.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;There is no god here!&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Please forgive me.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Lee-sahngho kept lowering his head as he cursed inside. &#xA0;There was no god on earth, so why did he have to apologize?</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;You have to find him! &#xA0;You must find him!&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Yes.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">It was an impossible task, but Lee-sahngho wasn&apos;t dumb enough to say it out loud. &#xA0;He left immediately after giving his answer. &#xA0;He left to find a god that didn&apos;t exist on earth.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;The Code...the Code...&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Iello&apos;s hands were shaking.</span></p><p><span style="">He had returned here, yet how can there be no Code? &#xA0;There is no way earth didn&apos;t have a Code.</span></p>
