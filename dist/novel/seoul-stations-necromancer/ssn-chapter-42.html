Why can&#x2019;t we see each other tomorrow at school? Why does she always call me out when the weather is cold.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The weather was getting cold. Jaemin quickly walked in haste as he adjusted his clothing. Jaemin looked into the distance when he saw a woman sitting on a swing inside a small playground.</span></p><p><span style="">Her figure was lit by the streetlight, and he was sure it was Lee-soolgi.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hey. We&#x2019;ll be able to see each other tomorrow at school. Why did you come here? It&#x2019;s dangerous.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yo. Jaemin is now worried about me?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Uh uh? Of course. It&#x2019;s really dark here, so it&#x2019;s dangerous for you.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Heh heh. The study bug Jaemin is now worry about this noonah. I guess it was worthwhile to come here?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Soolgi&#x2019;s bright smile and her words made Jaemin&#x2019;s heart pound. She was already pretty in her school uniform, but she was pretty in a different way in her casual clothes.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ha. Do you have something to say to me?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What&#x2019;s the rush? Sit here.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">At Soolgi&#x2019;s words, Jaemin sat next to her as he grumbled. Soolgi kicked the ground without saying anything. Her movement caused the swing to sway.</span></p><p><span style="">Jaemin didn&#x2019;t press her for an answer. He just waited for her. Today Soolgi was in some undecipherable mood. What did she want to say to him in such a serious manner&#x2026;.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hey, Jaemin.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yeah.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I was chosen by the SW agency as a trainee.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Jaemin was surprised. If it&#x2019;s the SW agency, it was a really big entertainment management company. And if she was chosen as a trainee&#x2026; With Soolgi&#x2019;s face, she wouldn&#x2019;t have any problem debuting as an entertainer.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ee&#x2026;ee-yah. Congratulation! Didn&#x2019;t I tell you in the past you will become a entertainer? C&#x2026;congratulations..&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;&#x2026;.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Soolgi didn&#x2019;t show any signs of being happy at Jaemin&#x2019;s congratulations.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Don&#x2019;t you have anything else to say except congratulations??&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;S&#x2026;say what?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Jaemin&#x2019;s heart trembled. Ah. Why was it shaking so much? Is it because she looks sad today? Soolgi would usually smile brightly towards him.</span></p><p><span style="">His heart pounded. His imagination ran wild, and it made it feel like he had stopped breathing.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Don&#x2019;t you have anything to say to me? This might be your last chance.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Haha. You have to become a great entertainer.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Soolgi&#x2019;s face was filled with disappointment. Her moist eyes turned damp. When Jaemin saw this it felt like he had committed a sin.</span></p><p><span style="">You stupid idiot. You made Soolgi sad. All kinds of guilt started to wash over him. However, he couldn&#x2019;t take back the words.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Idiot&#x2026; Even until the end&#x2026;&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Soolgi mumbled in a small voice.</span></p><p><span style="">He couldn&#x2019;t hear what she said at the end.</span></p><p><span style="">He was handsome and smart. He didn&#x2019;t play around like the other kids, and he didn&#x2019;t chase after the skirts of girls.</span></p><p><span style="">She really liked him&#x2026; In her heart, she had always wished Jaemin would reciprocate her feelings. It seemed she was the only one wishing for such results.</span></p><p><span style="">Soolgi stood up from the swing. She rubbed her eyes as she wiped away her tears, then she stood in front of Jaemin.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hey. S&#x2026;Soogi.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">It felt like Jaemin&#x2019;s heart was about to stop. It felt like the inside of his head was empty.</span></p><p><span style="">Soolgi tried her best to smile.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;When this noonah becomes famous, you are going to regret it.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Uh uh?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;There will be a day when you will hit the ground in regret.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;&#x2026;.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">She was so pretty. Just by looking at her eyes, his heart shook. He would most definitely regret it. No, he was already regretting it right now.</span></p><p><span style="">What should he say? Would it be possible to turn back the time?</span></p><p><span style="">His head was filled with complicated thoughts. However, the complicated thoughts flew away in a moment.</span></p><p><span style="">Choop.</span></p><p><span style="">Suddenly, Soolgi bent over then her lips met Jaemin&#x2019;s lips.</span></p><p><span style="">Hoo-oop. He stopped breathing.</span></p><p><span style="">A bat was continuously hitting Jaemin&#x2019;s heart.</span></p><p><span style="">It felt like time had stopped.</span></p><p><span style="">Soolgi&#x2019;s closed her eyes, and her face was right in front of his nose. Her long eyelashes trembled. Does that mean she is sad?</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hoo-oop.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">As if she was surprised by what she did, Soolgi pulled back with a red face. Jaemin&#x2019;s face also turned red, and he didn&#x2019;t know what to do.</span></p><p><span style="">What should he say? No thoughts came to his mind. Soolgi saw his flustered figure, and she laughed. &#x2018;Poot.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;When I become famous, you better not bully me on the internet.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Uh? Haha. No way.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Retard! Is that the only kind of answer he could give? He was about to lose his mind. Soolgi waved her hand.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Noonah is going. I&#x2019;ll see you tomorrow at school.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ooh-oong. See you.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Ah, he berated himself for being a retard. See you. He said see you&#x2026;.</span></p><p><span style="">His excited heart cooled down. His heart was talking to him. It said this is the end&#x2026; This is the end.</span></p><p><span style="">Catch her. Catch her.</span></p><p><span style="">In the end, his body didn&#x2019;t react to the voice inside heart.</span></p><p><span style="">*</span></p><p><span style="">[Yuhbo. I have something to say.]</span></p><p><span style="">[What is it?]</span></p><p><span style="">[Ddi-ri, Dda-rara, Ddararara&#x2026;.]</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ah-oh! How can it end there?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The drama he was watching with much interest ended, and a commercial for a cafe started running. This meant he had to wait until tomorrow to see it again.</span></p><p><span style="">He cleared his palate of regret when the front door opened.</span></p><p><span style="">Ddi, ddi, ddi. Ddi-ro-ri.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hey. You came back? Your noonah&#x2019;s hand phone num&#x2026;&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ooh-uhhhhhhng.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">What&#x2026;what the hell?</span></p><p><span style="">Jaemin came in crying, and he didn&#x2019;t even have the presence of mind to wipe away his tears. Woojin was taken aback.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;J&#x2026;Jaemin?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ooh-uhhhhhng.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Jaemin imedately went into the restroom. He came out after he washed his face. He started wiping the water off, and he looked more pitifuil like this. Soon tears started to fall once again like waterfalls from his red eyes.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ooh-uhhhhng. Soolgi.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hey. What&#x2019;s going on?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin wasn&#x2019;t sure if his words had been heard by Jaemin. Jaemin fell on to his bed, then he buried his face in to the pillow.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ooh-uhk, ooh-uhhhng.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;W&#x2026;what happened??&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ooo-ung, hy-ooh-ung, you shoooung, leave, ooh-uuhhng, alone. Hoo-uh&#x201D; (TLN:hyung should leave me alone)</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Uh, uh-whew. All right.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">He didn&#x2019;t know what Jaemin experienced outside, but it wasn&#x2019;t a situation where he could ask for Jiwon&#x2019;s phone number.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Oooh-uhhhhng.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Jaemin sobbed his heart out.</span></p><p><span style="">Regret and remorse. Sadness and fear.</span></p><p><span style="">Now he wouldn&#x2019;t even be able to dare to look up at Soolgi. She will probably be up too high for him.</span></p><p><span style="">Yes. How could he grab on to her ankles?</span></p><p><span style="">Good bye, Soolgi.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ooh-uhhhhhhng.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">He didn&#x2019;t&#x2019; know it when she was next to him. However, he knew it now that she was going to leave.</span></p><p><span style="">Jaemin found love late into his 3rd year of high school, and he cried endlessly.</span></p><p><span style="">*</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Uh-ooh. My dream was quite fierce.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">He had a nightmare every night, but today&#x2019;s nightmare was a bit worse than the usual ones. He dreamed of being chased by Jaemin, who wouldn&#x2019;t stop crying.</span></p><p><span style="">Jaemin had already left for school, so Woojin half-heartedly washed himself before he left the house.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I didn&#x2019;t get Jiwon&#x2019;s number.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">He wasn&#x2019;t in a hurry to get it. Woojin headed towards the address given by Haemin yesterday. It was a somewhat large building near the intersection.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;It&#x2019;s the 5th floor.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin entered the building, and the construction of the interior was in process.</span></p><p><span style="">Haemin found Woojin looking around with a blank expression on his face. He approached Woojin.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Uh. You are here, president?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;That&#x2019;s right. Where is team leader Jung?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;He went to the Management Bureau to hand in the paperwork for establishing the guild.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;When is he coming back?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;He should be back by lunch.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Is that so?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Do you want to look at the office?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Let&#x2019;s see it.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Haemin guided Woojin around the office. It was originally an office space, so the purpose of the construction was to re-organize the space.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Do you have an interior design in mind? If you tell it to me, then I can immediately change it.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Eh-ee. Just put a big tv in here.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Heh heh. Yes, sir. Also, please don&#x2019;t be so formal with me. I am older, but aren&#x2019;t you the president??&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin nodded his head at Haemin&#x2019;s words.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ok.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Uh? Still, he didn&#x2019;t expect Woojin to go straight to talking in an informal manner.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Since we&#x2019;ve moved, let&#x2019;s have jajangmyun for lunch.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;Yes.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">It felt weird. The funny thing was Woojin was only 24 years old, but he was quite natural at using informal speech.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I have nothing to do, so I&#x2019;ll go around the Dungeon once more..&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ah. You have to mine for the Artifacts.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Huh?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Aren&#x2019;t you going to the Dungeon to mine the Artifacts?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Why would I do that?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;&#x2026;.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Kim-haemin started to explain to Woojin about the change the Dungeon goes through after the first clear.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;The highest number of Artifacts comes out on the first raid. After it changes into a basic Dungeon, the number of Artifacts that can be found inside decreases. As one repeats the Dungeon, the probability of finding an Artifact decreases.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">This was why a number of Artifacts had come out of this Dungeon even if the basic monsters had been summoned. He had thought something was weird.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;After the Dungeon doesn&#x2019;t drop any Artifacts any more, the Dungeon is open to the public.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;To the Miners who excavate the bloodstones?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes. Still, the probability of an Artifact dropping isn&#x2019;t zero, so it does drop occasionally. If one shows up, it is considered a jackpot. Moreover, normal items also drops continuously.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin grinned.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;So we suck out the nectar first, then we rent out the rest to the outside party.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;T&#x2026;that&#x2019;s correct.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Then I&#x2019;ll be back after I go suck out the nectar. I&#x2019;ll come back at lunch..&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Are you going to take Mr. Sunggoo?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I&#x2019;ll just call him on the way.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes, sir. I&#x2019;ll drive you there.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Kim-haemin had been an elite inside the Support division. Dungeon management, Roused management and other duties related to the support division was mastered by him. Therefore, he smoothly took care of his business.</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin met Sunggoo in front of the Dungeon. Before the two of them could enter, Haemin asked a question.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Excuse me, president. Do you not excavate stuff like bloodstones?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;It&#x2019;s all in my sub-dimension.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Kim-haemin was surprised by Woojin&#x2019;s words. He had been curious as to why Woojin didn&#x2019;t bring anything out even after cleared the Dungeon twice.</span></p><p><span style="">He thought Woojin hadn&#x2019;t gathered any loot on the first run, since Woojin had to expend a lot of effort on the first raid. The second run was done so fast, so he thought Woojin had only picked up the few important artifacts before he came out.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What? Should I take it out?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;N&#x2026;no.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">There were too many eyes in the surrounding. Anyways, Artifacts were private property. It didn&#x2019;t matter where one sold the Artifacts. However, the bloostones had to be sold to the bloodstone exchange store run by the Management Bureau.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Excuse me, president. Please take care of the bloodstones this time at the exchange store. There are different routes to sell it, but those options are too troublesome.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;All right. Let&#x2019;s go, Sunggoo.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes, hyung-nim.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I&#x2019;ll head back to the office after I finish this run. Don&#x2019;t wait for me here. Go back to the office. I&#x2019;ll be back before lunch.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">There were only 3 hours and 30min left until 12 o&#x2019;clock&#x2026;.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;U&#x2026;understood.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin and Sunggoo headed towards the Dungeon, and Haemin returned to the office.</span></p><p><span style="">They had hired a lot of workers for the construction. The walls of the office were already clean, so only several fake walls had to be put up. The construction ended before lunch time.</span></p><p><span style="">When the walls were put up, the delivery men arrived in waves to deliver the furniture, and office appliances.</span></p><p><span style="">Jung-minchan arrived at the office around that time, and Woo-soonghoon also came to help tidy up the place. After they tidied everything up, it was already 1 o&#x2019;clock.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Whew. It looks a bit presentable now.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The workers were still here cleaning up the place, but everything seemed to be in place.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Everyone worked hard.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Haha. Team leader was the one who worked hard.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Mr. Soonghoon endured a lot too.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ah, yes.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Woo-soonghoon smiled bashfully. Yesterday, he thought this was a scam, but when he searched all over the internet, he couldn&#x2019;t find any evidence of this being a scam.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;I was already having a hard time living on commissions, so it might be better to join a guild instead.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">It didn&#x2019;t seem like they had work suited for him, but he wouldn&#x2019;t refuse any work assigned to him. Soonghoon had already packed up his store, then he put his store out on the real estate market in the morning. Then he came to this place.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;He seemed to be a scary person last time, but it seems he has a good conscience.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">He had beaten Soonghoon, and he also stole the expensive Crazy Red. However, Woojin had recruited him to the guild. When Sooghoon heard how Jung-minchan, and Kim-haemin spoke about Woojin, it seemed they were treated pretty well by him.</span></p><p><span style="">He might even receive a higher annual salary then when he worked at the store&#x2026;</span></p><p><span style="">Woo-soonghoon was filled with anticipation, and he waited for Woojin to return.</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin and Sunggoo returned to the office at around 2 o&#x2019;clock.</span></p><p><span style="">Sunggoo let out an exclamation when he got off the elevator.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ee-yah. This is a really good office.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Sunggoo was surprised, and even Woojin showed some signs of being surprised. In the morning, the office felt disorganized, but they had organized the office in a short amount of time.</span></p><p><span style="">The space really looked like an office.</span></p><p><span style="">It was a little bit too large for only 5 people to use this space. There seemed to be a little bit of an excessive number of desks here, and it bothered Woojin a little bit.</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin saw the unexpected person inside the office, and he tilted his head in puzzlement.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Why is this guy still here?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Woo-soonghoon had a confused expression on his face.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I just wanted to borrow your name.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">At Woojin&#x2019;s word, Woo-soonghoon&#x2019;s face drained of blood. Jung-minchan queried in surprise.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Y..you weren&#x2019;t trying to recruit him as founding member??&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Huh? I was just trying to fill up the required spots.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Jeez. I was mistaken&#x2026;&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">He thought Soonghoon was close to Woojin, but it seemed that wasn&#x2019;t the case. Woo-soonghoon was taken aback, so he didn&#x2019;t know what to do. Woojin grinned.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Well, we could just assign him work when needed. Anyways, let&#x2019;s order some jajangmyung. I&#x2019;m hungry.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes. I know of a delicious restaurant nearby.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Kim-haemin quickly picked up on Woojin&#x2019;s wishes, and he ordered the food. While Haemin was ordering the food, the topic of Woojin&#x2019;s sub-dimension came up.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;D..does that mean you stored all of your loot in the sub-dimension??&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yeah. I&#x2019;ll take it out after I eat.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Everyone except Sunggoo was filled with excitement at what Woojin said. It was the job of the Support division to sell the Artifacts, and items at a good price.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;It&#x2019;s a little bit small over here. What&#x2019;s that over there?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin pointed towards a door.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;That is the president&#x2019;s room. The room next to it is the storage room.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The office was so large that there were empty spaces left even after dividing the space. Woojin nodded his head after looking around. He needed a lot of room and this space was of an adequate size.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Well, I&#x2019;ll take it out now.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin opened his inventory, and he started pouring out all the loot he had stored up.
