<p><strong>Chapter 10 To the Dungeon.</strong></p><div id="chapterContent" class="innerContent fr-view"><p><span style="">Chapter 10 &#x2013; To the Dungeon</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p><p><span style="">Woojin grinned as he looked at his phone.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;This is great.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">He purposefully gave him a fake phone number&#x2026;</span></p><p><span style="">Since he already knew where he lived, Woojin wasn&#x2019;t worried about meeting him again. He had been wondering how to ask Jaemin if he could stay over for a couple days. However, it seemed like he could be a little shameless now.</span></p><p><span style="">He had earned a great excuse.</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin walked lightly towards Jaemin&#x2019;s rented room.</span></p><p><span style="">*</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Whew.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Do-jaemin let out a sigh as he saw the kids slowly look away from his gaze. It was great that the bullies didn&#x2019;t bother him anymore, but now his other normal classmates avoided him, except one person.</span></p><p><span style="">He was eating lunch by himself on a 6-man table when someone put a tray in front of him.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hey, I heard your big brother beat up all the bullies. Is it true?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Jaemin sighed when Lee-soolgi asked her question. He admitted Soolgi was pretty even to him. However, he had to focus on studying. If he started dating someone, then it would be a betrayal towards his hard-working sister.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Let&#x2019;s just eat.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hehe. Is it true he is your older cousin?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">He guessed weird rumors were going around. Before Jaemin could explain the situation, Soolgi laughed lightly.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Heh heh. I thought you were just handsome, but you also have some backing. Lee-soohyuk won&#x2019;t bother us again.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">His guilt toward his sister wasn&#x2019;t the only reason why he tried to distance himself from Soolgi. Everyone in the school knew Lee-soohyuk, the bully, had a crush on Soolgi.</span></p><p><span style="">However, Soolgi didn&#x2019;t even look at Soohyuk. She only hung around the handsome Jaemin, so of course, Soohyuk wouldn&#x2019;t look kindly at Jaemin.</span></p><p><span style="">Jaemin had put up a steel wall towards Soolgi, so he could act tactful in front of Soohyuk.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;I don&#x2019;t need to act tactful any more.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin wasn&#x2019;t really his older cousin, but even if that rumor spread, it wasn&#x2019;t a bad thing. The bullies won&#x2019;t be able to do anything to him.</span></p><p><span style="">Jaemin decided to look at the positives. He didn&#x2019;t have to walk on eggshells any more.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Do you like me?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Jaemin looked at her with a dumbfounded expression when she asked her straight-forward question. Why was this girl so aggressive?</span></p><p><span style="">Soolgi&#x2019;s smooth brows furrowed, then she pouted.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What? Am I not pretty?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Of course, you are pretty. However, he couldn&#x2019;t boldly say it with his mouth.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Eh-he. Let&#x2019;s just eat.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Study over dating. It wasn&#x2019;t too late for him to date after he got a job. After the lunch period ended, Soolgi bothered him for a long time. Jaemin broke free from her, then he headed toward his tutoring school.</span></p><p><span style="">Rrring.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Uh, big sister.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">His sister, Do-jiwon, always called him around the time he headed toward his tutoring school.</span></p><p><span style="">[Is everything ok?]</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Nothing much. Oh yeah. I met a strange big brother yesterday. He said he was 5 years my senior, and he was an alumni of my school. Do you know him? He said his name was Kang-woojin.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">His sister was also an alumni of Mido High school. Now that he thought about it, his sister was 5 years his senior, so she should have been in the same grade as Woojin.</span></p><p><span style="">[Huh? Woojin? He was a kid who suddenly went missing before the Dungeon Shock&#x2026;..]</span></p><p><span style="">Jiwon remembered Woojin. However, she knew of his existence only because the entire school had known he had gone missing. During her school days, it wasn&#x2019;t as if she was close to him.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Uh, you know about him, big sister. I&#x2019;ll give you a more through explanation when you come home this weekend. That big brother helped me out a little bit..&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">[Ok, Jaemin. Sister&#x2019;s break time is over. Study hard.]</span></p><p><span style="">During her 3rd year in high school, his big sister was already busy working at the factory.</span></p><p><span style="">His big sister was the reason why he could go to school without worrying about his living expenses. Jaemin was also able attend a tutoring school. His sister, who was 5 years older, was both his mother and father.</span></p><p><span style="">She was the driving force fueling him to study hard.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Oh yeah. He said he would give me my money back, but he just went away..&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Jaemin grinned before he knew it when he thought about Woojin.</span></p><p><span style="">He seemed to be crazy person, but he also didn&#x2019;t seem like a bad person. He was really scary when he was beating up the bullies, but he had been nice to Jaemin.</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin&#x2019;s beating of the bullies was well worth the 7300 won. From the beginning, he didn&#x2019;t plan on taking back the money. However, Woojin had promised numerous times that he would repay him yet he had left without doing so. This thought made him laugh.</span></p><p><span style="">Ddi-dik, Ddi-rori.</span></p><p><span style="">After the tutoring school had ended, Jaemin dragged his tired body home when his eyes became round.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Uh?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">He saw shoes he had never seen before. Moreover, that person was lying on his bed eating a tangerine.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;You are back, Jaemin?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;B..big brother. How did you know my secret pass-code?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I saw it last time when you pressed it.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;This&#x2026;this is trespassing.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ah, I tried to call you, but someone else answered the phone.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;That&#x2026;that is.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">As if he felt guilty, Jaemin stuttered when he spoke.</span></p><p><span style="">He really thought he would be extorted and put in a bad situation, so he had given him a fake number&#x2026;.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Bitch. Do you think I&#x2019;ll hit you? Just come over here. I have something I have to ask you.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Jaemin was nervous, so he sat rigidly. It was a strange scene where it looked like the ownership of the house had been switched. Woojin popped a peeled tangerine in his mouth as he asked a question.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;You said the Roused make a lot of money?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Th&#x2026;that&#x2019;s true.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I read there were guilds, associations and a lot of things like affiliations. I&#x2019;ve also read some Dungeons were disclosed to the public, and it was monopolized. Explain it to me.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">It was such an out-of-the-blue question that Jaemin tilted his head in confusion.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Why are you asking about that all of a sudden?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I want to attack the dungeon.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Big brother is one of the Roused?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Jaemin asked in surprised, then he kicked himself. Woojin had defeated over twenty bullies in a flash. If he wasn&#x2019;t a Roused, his god-like movement couldn&#x2019;t be explained.</span></p><p><span style="">He believed him like an idiot. He thought he had learned martial arts on the Jiri Mountain.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I just need some money. Tell me what you know.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;If you want to enter a private dungeon, you have to register yourself with the Association as a Roused.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Originally, Jaemin already had a lot of interest in the Roused and the Guilds. No, it could be said every male around his age was interested in this topic.</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin quietly heard his zealous explanation, while he peeled another tangerine.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;So I just have to register myself as a Roused, then I can make the most money by attacking the Dungeon by myself?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">At Woojin&#x2019;s words, Jaemin hit his chest as if he was frustrated. Did he even listen to his explanation?</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;That is how the rate is calculated. However, it is too dangerous, so it would be best if one joins a Guild. If not, you could get a job at the Association or government bureau.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I hear you have to take an entrance exam for a Guild? I don&#x2019;t have time to wait for the result. Doesn&#x2019;t the Associations, and government bureaus all work on monthly salaries? I can&#x2019;t wait for a month.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Jaemin shook his head.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Then, at the very least, you have to form a party. Dungeons are a really dangerous place. Oh yeah. You said you bought a cell phone? Be sure to download this app.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;App?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin wasn&#x2019;t familiar with smart phones, so Jaemin downloaded the app in his stead.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I&#x2019;ll do it for you. Uh? This is Gallery1. Wow, people still use this. Did one of your family member use this?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Is..isn&#x2019;t that the newest model?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What? Maybe if it was 4 years ago. Did you perhaps buy it as a new item?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">At Jaemin&#x2019;s reaction, Woojin knew he had been duped.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;That mother fucking phone salesman.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">He conned the ultimate necromancer. If this was Planet Alphen, such an event was unthinkable.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ah, this is so slow. Anyways, this is the Dungeon Forum. Originally, this was the subway info app. However, the Roused Association purchased it, and they remade it. Now it is a comprehensive portal app that deals with everything related to the Dungeons. &#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Jaemin prattled on as he dumped out all the info he had. As he had said, the Dungeon Forum was a comprehensive app.</span></p><p><span style="">It had a section for hiring members to attack Dungeons. It also had a function where one could search for Dungeon in its attack time period. It also warned people of a dangerous Dungeon where a Dungeon Break will occur soon.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Once you register as a Roused with the Association, you will log in with your Roused ID. It&#x2019;ll even give you a record on who failed during mid-dungeon attack.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hmm.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin fiddled with the app to learn how to use it.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Anyways, I just need to search for a Dungeon in mid-attack, then I can challenge it?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I heard it is safe to go to a captured Mine.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">It displayed information about the captured Dungeon Mines. It gave the location of the most important item, the Return Stone. It also listed which monster appeared and it was much easier to form a party. It was considered to be comparatively safe.</span></p><p><span style="">The problem was he had to give a fixed amount of loot he found in the dungeon to the Guild or Roused, who first successfully captured the Dungeon. He also had to give a fixed service charge to the Association, and another commission to the first person who captured the Dungeon.</span></p><p><span style="">Since Woojin hadn&#x2019;t recovered his previous power, he thought it was a good choice to enter a captured Dungeon with an exploration term. The problem was coming up with the entrance fee he had to pay when he entered the Mine for the first time. It was a burdensome sum for the current Woojin.</span></p><p><span style="">Since one had had to risk one&#x2019;s life during a Dungeon Attack, everything was free. The Mine was a gold mine where one could get items, monster&#x2019;s corpses and blood stones. Therefore, it required an incredible amount of commissions, and entrance fees.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;So a dungeon where I could make a fair amount of money has an entrance fees that is over 100,000 won?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;T&#x2026;that&#x2019;s correct.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">There were numerous Dungeons with higher fees, but there were no Dungeons below it. The free Dungeons were abandoned Mines like the Gwachun Station&#x2019;s 1st exit, where one couldn&#x2019;t make any money.</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin thought about it. He could challenge a Dungeon in mid-capture to get a sizable windfall, or he could aim for a safe captured Mine with less profit.</span></p><p><span style="">He agonized over the decision, but his answer was decided. The thought of his family prevented him from doing a reckless challenge. He wasn&#x2019;t some apostle of justice. He had no reason to put his life on the line to clear a Dungeon in mid-capture.</span></p><p><span style="">Moreover, he couldn&#x2019;t return to his mother to ask for the entrance fee&#x2026;..</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Let me borrow some money.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;&#x2026;.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">At the bold Woojin&#x2019;s words, Jaemin felt like he had fallen into a trap he couldn&#x2019;t escape from.</span></p><p></p></div><p></p>
