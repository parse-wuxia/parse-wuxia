<p><span style="">Chapter 169 - Reconstruction (2)</span></p><p><span style="">Dwarf Nosam was an expert in mechanical engineering. &#xA0;He scouted out the aircraft carrier, and he returned to Bibi to give a report.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;It is excellent. &#xA0;I&apos;m surprised by Planet earth&apos;s technical skills.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Is that so? &#xA0;Will it be able to fly?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;This is unsuitable for flight.... &#xA0;This ship is supposed to be used to float on water....&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;What are you saying? &#xA0;Are you saying it won&apos;t be able to fly?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Bibi&apos;s bright eyes glared at him, and the surprised Nosam bowed his head. &#xA0;As a Dimensional refugee, the admin of a Colony was the next highest person in terms of ranking after the Dimensional lord.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I&apos;ll do my best.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;That&apos;s right. &#xA0;Hurry up and fix it. &#xA0;I think it can&apos;t fly, because it is broken.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;....&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Are you saying you can&apos;t fix it?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;N...no. &#xA0;I&apos;ll do my best.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;If you need anything, don&apos;t hesitate to ask. &#xA0;I&apos;ve received the authority to use unlimited amount of Points.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Huh-uhk.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Nosam lowered his head deeper towards Bibi. &#xA0;If a Dimensional lord allowed her to use unlimited amount of Points, it meant she was in his inner circle. &#xA0;There was no downside in getting on her good side.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I&apos;ll release a blueprint soon.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;All right. &#xA0;I&apos;ll look forward to it.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Bibi&apos;s eyes were twinkling from anticipation.</span></p><p><span style="">Nosam bowed, and he was about to leave when he came face to face with Jung-minchan at the doorway. &#xA0;They gave each other an awkward greeting. &#xA0;After passing by Nosam, Minchan approached Bibi.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;What are those things that suddenly formed on the deck, Steward Bibi?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;What do think it is? Those are essential buildings.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">She had bought several buildings from the Dimensional Store, and those buildings were being built on the deck. &#xA0;There were new workers she had hired, and the Dimensional Domain residents of Alandal were naturally coming back and forth from the Colony and the Domain.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;If you build all those buildings on the deck, what are we going to do about the planes?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">If the runway was taken over by the buildings, they would only be able to operate the several helicopters they owned from that space. &#xA0;Minchan didn&apos;t know what Bibi was planning, so he had come looking for her.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Ah. &#xA0;Don&apos;t worry about it. &#xA0;Master decided to give the heli-whatever to Dolsae. &#xA0;He prefers to use the Wyverns flying in formation.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Bibi had already been told about Woojin&apos;s plans. &#xA0;The Wyverns were able to take off vertically, so they didn&apos;t need a long runway. &#xA0;The outer parts of the Colony city would be decorated by Bibi. &#xA0;It was up to her discretion.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Hmmm. I guess if we use the Wyverns...&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">After imagining it for a moment, Minchan nodded his head.</span></p><p><span style="">However, what did that have to with constructing these buildings....</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Why are you building a cafe and a dessert store on top of the deck.....&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">He would understand it if she erected a Wyvern&apos;s Nest or a Training Facility. &#xA0;Why was building a cafe the most important task on the agenda?</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;They are very important.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;....&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Minchan became momentarily speechless at Bibi&apos;s sure attitude. &#xA0;Currently, restaurants, entertainment facilities and cultural facilities for the residents had already been built beneath the deck.</span></p><p><span style="">However, Bibi was filling the top teck with buildings that had nothing to do with battle. &#xA0;Moreover, the other races were crossing over from the Dimensional Domain, and the residents of Alandal wasn&apos;t used to this sight. &#xA0;He worried there would be friction amongst these two groups.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;More importantly, our residents aren&apos;t able to communicate with the Dimensional Domain residents....&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Oh yea. &#xA0;I&apos;ll have to sell some of the Language Drugs.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">She was direct in her actions.</span></p><p><span style="">How could there be such an easy solution like this?</span></p><p><span style="">Minchan was at a loss for words. &#xA0;Bibi immediately bought a store that sold Language Drugs from the Dimensional store. &#xA0;She would build it right at the base of the control tower.</span></p><p><span style="">In the end, the Colony city was built through Point consumption. &#xA0;If she could complete a &#xA0;blueprint, it&apos;ll all be built within the day.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I want you to tell the Domain Residents to buy and eat the Language Drug. &#xA0;Tell them to buy it with the Blood Stones.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Alandal&apos;s Prime Minister Minchan spoke a long time with Bibi, who held authority over the Colony. &#xA0;They discussed various issues.</span></p><p><span style="">A city where the current Domain Residents and the residents of this planet could gather Bloodstones on earth was being made right now.</span></p><p><span style="">Zeeeeng.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Uh? What is that?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">On the deck below the control tower, a new portal was formed. &#xA0;The eye-catching part was that this new portal was different in color to the red portal next to it.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;It seems master has made a Colony in Alphen. &#xA0;Of course, it hasn&apos;t been fully activated yet.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">The aircraft carrier had several portals.</span></p><p><span style="">There was the one heading to the Dimensional Domain of Alandal, Seoul Station&apos;s 1st exit and Necia&apos;s Pillar on planet Jaku.</span></p><p><span style="">When the newly added portal was activated, a portal heading towards Alphen would be formed.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;So I can head to Alphen if I pass through that one?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Mmmm. &#xA0;Yes. &#xA0;However, you&apos;ll need permission from master.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;So the king was successful in building his Colony.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Isn&apos;t that a given?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Bibi&apos;s faith in Kahng-woojin was the deepest compared to anyone by his side. She was his first familiar, and she had aided him for the longest time.</span></p><p><span style="">Minchan spoke as he laughed.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I&apos;ll go ready the second party.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">It wasn&apos;t too long before Che-haesol, Blanka and the Phantom Unit would have to cross over.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;You do that.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Bibi gave a general answer, then she opened the Dimensional Store. &#xA0;She busily started decorating the aircraft carrier.</span></p><p><span style="">The Point Total for the Domain was dropping at a rapid pace.</span></p><p><span style="">***</span></p><p><span style="">A tree was planted on top of the Sauraus mountain. &#xA0;Latasha was shocked when she saw how fast it grew.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;How do you have a World Tree....&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Tree of Life.</span></p><p><span style="">The Mother World Tree communicated with the world, yet a Necromancer, who studied death, had planted it. &#xA0;He was the most unlikely person to interact with the World Tree.</span></p><p><span style="">Of course, it was only a symbol chosen for the Colony, and it didn&apos;t hold much significance to Woojin. &#xA0;However, each person felt differently about such symbols.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;What did the crest of your Coalition look like?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Alphen&apos;s heroes were surprised at Woojin&apos;s words.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Why are you so surprised? &#xA0;Do you think people will gather if I put up my flag?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">They had to make it known, who is residing at the Sauras mountain. &#xA0;In the first place, he hadn&apos;t picked this place with his enemies in mind. &#xA0;He had placed the Colony here with the surviving Coalition members in mind.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Y...yes, that&apos;s right. &#xA0;We have to make it known that the Coalition is alive and well.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">The shocking part was that those words had come out from the Immortal&apos;s mouth.</span></p><p><span style="">Currently, the person that was breaking down everything in a rational manner was the Immortal. </span></p><p><span style="">Melody made a suggestion as she looked at Woojin.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;You should put up Alandal&apos;s flag.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Mmmm. &#xA0;If I did that, wouldn&apos;t people avoid this place?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Ah...&quot; </span></p><p><span style="">Melody let out a sigh. Just from looking at the expression on the heroes here she knew everyone held a deep-seated fear and wariness towards him. &#xA0;She realized how much her way of thinking had changed.</span></p><p><span style="">&apos;Kahng-woojin-nim isn&apos;t a bad person.&apos;</span></p><p><span style="">No, he might be a bad person. &#xA0;However, he wasn&apos;t the unbelievably scary Necromancer that she had vaguely imagined in her mind. &#xA0;At the very least, he was someone she can converse with.</span></p><p><span style="">She had watched Woojin as she lived near him on earth, and this was her feeling on this subject.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;All right. &#xA0;Let&apos;s put this out too.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin took out the flag that had been purchased by Bibi. &#xA0;It had the picture of a cat that seemed to be roaring.</span></p><p><span style="">It was quite different from the symbols and imagery that had been associated with Alandal in Alphen.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Is Lecia&apos;s high priest still alive?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;He tried to resist against the Undead Army....&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">It seemed he had killed the high priest. &#xA0;Woojin let out a bitter laugh.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Shouldn&apos;t there be a successor?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;....&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Melody had come back from earth with Woojin. &#xA0;She didn&apos;t have the answer to his question.</span></p><p><span style="">The answer came from Latasha&apos;s lips.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;The high priest that received Lecia&#x2019;s Holy Item is staying in the north. &#xA0;He is staying at the city of Litan.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Ho-oh. &#xA0;That&apos;s great. You should lead the way.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;W...why would I...&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Let&#x2019;s just go.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;....&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Latasha frowned, but she didn&apos;t have much choice. &#xA0;She stepped forward.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;The Colony will be activated in a day. &#xA0;Do a good job and protect it.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">His Colony had just been formed. &#xA0;Until it activated, Woojin didn&apos;t have much to do here. &#xA0;He&apos;ll be able to build a city later through the Dimensional Store.</span></p><p><span style="">It would be better for him to go out and find the Items he needed.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I&apos;m going to clean the surrounding. &#xA0;You should rest a little bit. &#xA0;I&apos;ll be back.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Go-shoo-shoo&apos;s army had been annihilated, and he had even stolen Juliel&apos;s Colony. &#xA0;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">Two Dimensional lords in this region was dead, but their underlings were still out and about. &#xA0;However, Woojin didn&apos;t need to stay behind to clear them out of this region when there were no Dimensional lords nearby. &#xA0;Sunggoo and the heroes of Alphen was sufficient in being able to take care of them.</span></p><p><span style="">The most important part was the fact that he was forming a base camp here. &#xA0;He needed either a Colony city or a town. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">As time passes, monsters will start to gather around the Sauraus mountain.</span></p><p><span style="">As he methodically take over the Dungeons and Colonies of other Dimensional lords, they&apos;ll start to counter-attack.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Well, let&apos;s go.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;...&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Latasha looked at the World Tree once again, then she floated into the air.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Follow me.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Her body was encased in a fierce wind as she accompanied a Wind Spirit into the air. &#xA0;Woojin got on Shing Shing as he chased after Latasha.</span></p><p><span style="">When they left, Melody unfurled the flag.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Mmmm? &#xA0;Is that really the symbol of Alandal?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;The combination of those two is a bit...&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">What sane person would think about Alandal when one saw a picture of a cat? &#xA0;She had already seen it several times before, but Melody couldn&#x2019;t stop her laughter from coming out.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Let&apos;s hang it up.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Mmmm.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;We have to advertise the alliance between Alphen&apos;s Coalition and Alandal.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">They put the two flags representing the two forces in front of the World Tree that was growing atop the Saurus mountaintop.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;So why is the Immortal trying to find Lecia&apos;s high priest?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;That&apos;s...&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">When trying to predict a person&apos;s action, one usually thought about their past actions. &#xA0;In the past....</span></p><p><span style="">The Immortal threatened, stole and killed all the time. &#xA0;This was why everyone&apos;s expression darkened.</span></p><p><span style="">The Immortal&apos;s relationship with the priests, who worshipped the gods, was especially poor.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Maybe... &#xA0;I wonder if he is planning on stealing Lecia&apos;s holy object again...&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Tauric was god Skia&apos;s monk, and his face crumpled. &#xA0;He had experienced it before too.</span></p><p><span style="">He gnashed his teeth when he thought about the time when the Holy Item called Skia&apos;s Boots were pulled off his feet.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;It seems his desire to collect the Holy Items is still present.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">It had been a subject that had been discussed for a long time in the past about the Immortal&apos;s peculiar collection</span></p><p><span style="">He broke a branch off the World Tree, and he stole Holy Items from each temple.... &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">The Immortal&apos;s Army had been getting to become a serious problem when he started to gather all these treasures.</span></p><p><span style="">Tauric suddenly looked at this boots.</span></p><p><span style="">As expected of being a god of adventurers, Skia&apos;s Boots allowed one to run without getting exhausted.</span></p><p><span style="">A Holy Item was newly made when a new high priest appeared.</span></p><p><span style="">His boots were the 21st Skia&apos;s Boots to be made after the Immortal stole one. &#xA0;The boots were a treasure that proved that he was the First Monk of the god Skia.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Why wasn&apos;t he covetous of my Item?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">If he still coveted the Holy Items, Tauric&apos;s Item should have been the first one he should have taken. &#xA0;The fact that the Immortal left him alone made him feel leery.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Hmm. &#xA0;I have no idea.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">They didn&apos;t know why the Immortal went to look for Lecia&apos;s high priest, but there was no way he would just unreasonably steal the Item like before. &#xA0;They were allies now.</span></p><p><span style="">Maybe...</span></p><p><span style="">***</span></p><p><span style="">They were at the biggest lake in the northern region.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Is that the Litan&apos;s Lake?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Yes.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;There is a city there?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;This is the final city of the Coalition still left standing. &#xA0;However, only the chosen people could enter this place.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Litan&apos;s Lake was large like the sea. &#xA0;There was only a single green island floating atop the waters.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;You have to be chosen?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;The Water Dragons bar intruders from entering the Litan&apos;s Lake.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">This was the reason why the city of Litan was able to avoid attacks from the Dimensional lords. &#xA0;At the same time, there weren&apos;t many in the Coalition that had access to this place.</span></p><p><span style="">This was their hideout, and it was also the final supply depot for the Coalition.</span></p><p><span style="">The food from the Litan&apos;s Island provided the main supplies for the Coalition.</span></p><p><span style="">Latasha sat down at the dock, and she turned to look at Woojin.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Even I do not have permission to enter this place. &#xA0;The lookouts at the Litan Island probably caught sight of us already. &#xA0;A person will appear soon to talk to us.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin&apos;s brows furrowed.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;We have to wait until that time?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;This is the only way you will be able to meet the Lecia&apos;s high priest.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">If one couldn&apos;t go to the Litan Island, one had to wait for the people on the island to come out.</span></p><p><span style="">However, Woojin smirked as he grabbed the collar of Latasha&apos;s shirt.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;W...what the hell are you doing?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;In this world, there is no such thing as an only method.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">It was a binary choice. &#xA0;There was a road or there wasn&apos;t.</span></p><p><span style="">Instead of walking on the road, Immortal frequently made his own roads to travel. &#xA0;He grabbed Latasha&apos;s back collar, and Shing Shing flew into the air.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;T...the Water Dragons will attack....&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">She was dangling in the sky, and Latasha&apos;s face turned pale. &#xA0;A whirlpool started forming in the lake. There were 17 of them.</span></p><p><span style="">The Water Dragons readied their Dragon&apos;s Breath.</span></p>
