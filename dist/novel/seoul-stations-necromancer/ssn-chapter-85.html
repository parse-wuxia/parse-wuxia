She pulled out the bloodstone.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Aigo. I&apos;ve excavated them all.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Haesol put the bloodstone inside the bag, then stretched her back.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Isn&apos;t it hard?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;No.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Haesol drank the water bottle that was handed to her by Sunggoo. Woojin had taken the water out from his amazing sub-dimension. It was clean water. She didn&apos;t have to worry about contamination. She knew they could get sick if they dared to eat and drink anything inside the Dungeon.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hoo. Still, the Reinforcement Stones I ate before I came here helped a lot.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Haha. Keep taking whatever he gives you immediately.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">It was Sunggoo&apos;s absolute ironclad rule.</span></p><p><span style="">Never turn down anything given by Woojin.</span></p><p><span style="">You do what he asks, and you don&apos;t do anything when he says no.</span></p><p><span style="">If one followed this rule, at the very least, one wouldn&#x2019;t lose one&apos;s life.</span></p><p><span style="">Not long ago, Sunggoo was able to solo clear a 5 star Dungeon.</span></p><p><span style="">The stress and nervousness he had felt that time couldn&apos;t be compared to what he felt right now. He felt secure, and it was as if he had come to a picnic with Woojin to this Dungeon.</span></p><p><span style="">Still, he wasn&apos;t just playing around. He was letting out sweat as he gathered the bloodstones.</span></p><p><span style="">Thus, this couldn&#x2019;t be compared to a picnic. He guessed it was akin to digging for spring herbs?</span></p><p><span style="">Anyways, he knew for sure his life wasn&#x2019;t in danger.</span></p><p><span style="">This was also true for Haesol.</span></p><p><span style=""> &#x201C;I was very surprised. I didn&apos;t realized that the president could control so many Undead...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The Summoning Type Roused could Summon or Tame. Moreover, the quality and quantity of one&apos;s summon varied based on one&apos;s ability. Even if each one of Woojin&apos;s Skeleton Warriors and Skeleton Magicians were Rank C, he could control over a hundred of them.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Right now I think he is summoning only half of what he could actually summon. I&apos;ve never seen him summon up to his limit yet. Haha.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;&#x2026;.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Just stop trying to make sense of him.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ha. The world still doesn&apos;t know even half of our president&apos;s true abilities.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">That&apos;s right. This was also true for Sunggoo, who raided the Dungeons with Woojin. Sunggoo had always watched Woojin from the side and had never seen his limit.</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin was continuously getting stronger.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;He&apos;s coming here right now.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin travelled up the destroyed path in the forest, leading his Skeleton Army. She knew they were her allies, yet her heart automatically beat faster when she saw the nefarious group of Skeletons. There were several hundreds of them.</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin walked in front of the group, but there was nothing extraordinary about his posture.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Goo-uhhhh.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Between the Skeleton Army, she saw a peerless being.</span></p><p><span style="">A Golem made out of boulders was walking forward with something in his hand.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Haesol.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes, sir!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">When Woojin called her name, Haesol quickly ran towards him.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Try taming this one.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;T...that one?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">There was a white tiger struggling in Dolsae&apos;s hand.</span></p><p><span style="">No. If one compared it to a creature on earth, the monster was like the extinct sabre-toothed tiger.</span></p><p><span style="">Pah-paht.</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin summoned several bone spears and stuck them into the ground. When he injected his magical energy, they formed into a Bone Prison. Dolsae threw the sabre-toothed tiger inside.</span></p><p><span style="">Puh-uhk!</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Koo-roo-roo-roo-roo.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The saber-toothed tiger was thrown roughly onto the flooR. It soon crouched in a low posture, growling.</span></p><p><span style="">From across the bars made out of bones, she could feel an incredible pressure emanating from the saber-toothed tiger as she faced it. The tiger was so large that it would be apt to describe it as a house-sized tiger.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Y...you want me to enter there?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin grinned at Haesol&apos;s words.</span></p><p><span style="">He had captured it easily, but the saber-toothed tiger was level 57.</span></p><p><span style="">If Haesol entered the cage, she wouldn&apos;t even last three seconds before she was ripped into pieces.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;You want to die already?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;&#x2026;.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hey, Sunggoo.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Yes, hyung-nim.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Work it over so it&apos;ll be obedient.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Yes, sir.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Sunngoo bravely jumped over the bars made out of bones.</span></p><p><span style="">Haesol&apos;s eyes turned round at his decisiveness. Sunggoo was Alandal&apos;s second Roused, and he had just reached Rank B a month ago.</span></p><p><span style="">He was Kahng-Woojin&apos;s man.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Heh heh. Hello.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Koo-roo-roo-rook.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Sunggoo grinned as he looked at the saber-toothed tiger.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Kwahhhhhhhng!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The saber-toothed tiger opened its mouth wide, then let out a roar. It couldn&apos;t affect an ogre, but the Fear was deadly enough to freeze small animals.</span></p><p><span style="">Haesol&apos;s body froze and she felt as if her legs were rooted to the floor. Sunggoo rubbed his ears.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Well, I&apos;m sorry about this.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">After he gave an apology, Sunggoo ran towards the saber-toothed tiger. The Bone Prison was about 5 meters in radius. There weren&apos;t that much space where one could dodge, but the saber-toothed tiger had no intention of dodging.</span></p><p><span style="">The saber-toothed tiger lowered its posture and waited for an opportunity to attack Sunggoo.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Iron Skin.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Sunggoo activated his Iron Skin to make his entire body hard. Then he started beating on the sabertooth tiger.</span></p><p><span style="">Puh-uhk, Puhk!</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Kwahhng.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Puh-uhk, Puhk! Ggwahng!</span></p><p><span style="">Once in awhile, Sunggoo missed with his stomp and his foot would get stuck in the ground. However, this rarely happened. The saber-toothed tiger was too big and there were too many places to hit it.</span></p><p><span style="">The saber-toothed tiger&apos;s agility was useless.</span></p><p><span style="">It wasn&apos;t only because it was in a small cage.</span></p><p><span style="">Hoooong, puh-uhk, puhk!</span></p><p><span style="">Sunggoo recurrently took the Reinforcement Stones, therefore his Stats had already passed the realm of human limitation. He rivaled the saber-toothed tiger... No, he was better than it.</span></p><p><span style="">Sunggoo let out flashy strikes with his fists. He was like a professional boxer, attacking in a simple, but effective manner. With a minimum amount of movement, he dodged a swipe by the saber-toothed tiger&apos;s claw and continued his ruthless beating.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Director Hong was that strong?&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">After she sent in her letter of application to the Alandal guild, Che-haesol had researched the guild thoroughly. She knew Director Sunggoo had started out as a Rank F and received a Rank B last month.</span></p><p><span style="">In her mind, she knew a Rank B would be somewhat strong. However, there was a world of differences between imagining it and actually seeing it with one&apos;s eyes.</span></p><p><span style="">Even amongst the Rank B Roused, he would be considered to be in the top tier of the physical-based Roused.</span></p><p><span style="">He was such a cheerful guy... She had gathered bloodstones with this young man. Haesol was shocked when she saw this unexpected side of Sunggoo.</span></p><p><span style="">She wasn&apos;t shocked by Sunggoo&apos;s fast movements.</span></p><p><span style="">He had on a cheerful face as he moved in a leisurely manner.</span></p><p><span style="">The relaxed manner Sunggoo was exhibiting confused Haesol.</span></p><p><span style="">When Haesol entered the Bone Prison, the saber-toothed tiger was barely holding on to its life. It had been worked over very thoroughly. It looked as if the saber-toothed tiger was exhausted, and one weak blow might send it to its death.</span></p><p><span style="">Haesol put her hand on the sabre-toothed tiger&apos;s head as she initiated her Taming Skill.</span></p><p><span style="">Pah-pah-paht.</span></p><p><span style="">The light gathered in her hand as it encased the saber-toothed tiger and Haesol before it disappeared. Haesol turned to look at Woojin with a dark expression.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;It failed.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin shrugged his shoulder.</span></p><p><span style="">Considering their discrepancy in level, it was quite unlikely that the Taming would succeed.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Keep doing it until you succeed...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;Understood.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Afterwards, Haesol tried twelve more times, and she failed every single one of them. Her body was soaked with sweat as she plopped down onto the floor.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I...I don&apos;t have any more magic. It&apos;s depleted.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin sent a single soul towards her to fill up her energy.</span></p><p><span style="">An unknown energy was absorbed by her body, and she felt her magic fill up. Haesol looked towards Woojin with a confused expression.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Keep at it...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;Yes.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Haesol continued to use her Taming Skill, and kept failing. Sunggoo couldn&apos;t take it anymore, so he tried to give some advice.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Try wishing for it in earnest as you use your skill. Maybe the universe might give you a helping hand.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;&#x2026;.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Did he really think Taming would work if she did such a thing?</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hey, Sunggoo. That bastard is eyeing Haesol&apos;s neck. Beat him a little bit more.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Uh? It recovered a little bit.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Puh-puh-puhk.</span></p><p><span style="">The saber-toothed tiger, who had been on its last breath, had recovered some of its strength as it laid on the ground. It was waiting for an opportunity to attack Haesol, but Sunggoo immediately started beating up the saber-toothed tiger.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ggeeeng, ggaeng.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin gave a single advice to Haesol, who had retreated backwards.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Don&apos;t be too impatient. Considering the level difference, this is a tough task.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">It would have been better if it was a lower rank monster. However, they were in a high rank Dungeon. There were goblins here, but it was harder to Tame a monster living in a tribal society. It was easier to Tame a wild animal like the saber-toothed tiger.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;There are two ways to Tame a monster. You have to feel a sense of closeness, and you have to become its friend. The other method is to dominate the monster into submission. What method do you think you are using right now?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">She watched as Sunggoo ruthlessly beat up the saber-toothed tiger. Haesol spoke in a careful manner.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Aren&#x2019;t we trying to dominate the monster?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Neither. Are you dominating the monster right now?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">As a Necromancer, Woojin had a Stat named &apos;Control.&apos; Tamers had a Stat called &#x2018;Intimacy&apos;. This Stat has to be high for the Tamer to have a higher probability of Taming a high rank monster.</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin pointed towards Sunggoo, who was beating up the saber-toothed tiger.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;He is the villain.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;&#x2026;.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin pointed his finger towards the saber-toothed tiger that was being beaten.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;That bastard being beaten is your friend.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;&#x2026;.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin grabbed Haesol&apos;s shoulder with his hand.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;You want to become friend with that bastard, who is getting beaten.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin and Haesol looked at each other&apos;s face.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What should you do?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I...I should stop it?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;No. You have to protect him from the villain. &#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;&#x2026;.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">What kind of situation was this? Did he expect her to perform in a skit?</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;So you want me to act&#x2026;.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;No. You have to act as if you mean it. You are protecting the cat from the villainous director of miscellaneous work. Go fight him. Defeat the villain.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;&#x2026;.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin yelled towards Sunggoo.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Did you hear what I said?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes, hyung-nim.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Just put on an adequate acting performance.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin patted Haesol&apos;s back.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Go save it. Then become friends with it.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;yes.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Sunggo yelled out when Haesol ran in.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ooh-heh heh. A person like you can&apos;t block me.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">It seemed Sunggoo watched some anime. Haesol wondered if she should say something back for the benefit of the saber-toothed tiger. However, Sunggoo&apos;s fist flew in towards her.</span></p><p><span style="">Haesol, unconsciously, brought her guard up to block the blow.</span></p><p><span style="">Puhk!</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Uh?&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">Sunggoo swung his fist in a slow motion, but the impact on her arm bones weren&apos;t light.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Huh-ook!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The pain was focused into a single moment, and she couldn&apos;t even scream. She let out a gasp. She spoke as she felt the pain coming from her fractured bones.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;D...director Hong. Y...you broke my arm.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ooh-heh heh. You are so weak.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;D..director Hong.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">He was still laughing in a cheerful manner as he let out a kick. Haesol felt true fear when she saw the kick coming. She rolled on the ground to avoid the blow, feeling that her life was being threatened.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;You should quickly attack him, then try using Taming again.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">At Woojin&apos;s voice, Haesol approached Sunggoo and punched him in the chest. Sunggoo could have easily avoided it, but he flew backward from the blow&#x2026; he jumped backwards.</span></p><p><span style="">Kwah-jeek!</span></p><p><span style="">Sunggoo flew backwards as he broke through the Bone bars. Sunggoo fell to the ground and he writhed on the ground.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;&#x2026;.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">She knew she hadn&apos;t done it, but she still looked between her fist, and at Sunggoo who had been blown away.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hurry up and Tame it.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes, sir.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Could such a dumb acting job be effective? Haesol turned back to looked at the saber-toothed tiger. It was beaten so badly that it could barely roll its eyes to look at her.</span></p><p><span style="">The eyes were filled with tears.</span></p><p><span style="">She could feel it even before she started taming it.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;I...it&apos;s deeply moved by my gesture?&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">Haesol approached the saber-toothed tiger, and she put her hand over its head. Light burst from her hand and a pillar of light surround both of them as the light made a strong connection between them.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Koo-roong.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The saber-toothed tiger let out a purr of pleasure, and its feelings were transferred directly to Haesol.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;It was deeply moved. It was thankful. It wanted to repay her.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">It had been captured and beaten by the humans. It felt grateful towards the human who had stood up to the other humans to save him.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;You earned one guardian.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Wooji grinned as he took out a soul stored in the Soul Armor. He immediately healed Haesol&apos;s broken arm and the saber-toothed tiger.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Koo-roo-roo-rook.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The recovered saber-toothed tiger showed its teeth towards Woojin and Sunggoo. However, it did not show any hostility towards Haesol, who had been by his side.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;That bastard should be enough to protect you from threats.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Thank you.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;All right. Follow me as you excavate the bloodstones.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;Yes.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Also, train the Skills you learned today.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes, sir.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin worked Haesol hard to complete the Taming of the saber-toothed tiger, because he wanted to freely use Sunggoo. If Sunggoo was left behind as Haesol&apos;s bodyguard, he could excavate the bloodstones but their overall efficiency would suffer.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Heh heh. How was my acting skills, hyung-nim?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;You could win the award for best actor.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ooh-heh heh heh.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Even at Woojin&apos;s faint praise, Sunggoo was very much pleased.</span></p><p><span style="">Haesol shook her head from side to side. She looked at Sunggoo as she exaggerated her hardship.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hoo. Director Hong was quite scary before.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Heh heh. I hit you softly, since I was afraid you would die.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;&#x2026;.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Maybe Director Hong was more dangerous than the president.</span></p><p><span style="">Sunggoo hadn&apos;t had a big presence inside Haesol&apos;s head. She didn&apos;t think too much of him. However, she quickly upgraded Sunggoo as a main player inside her head.</span></p><p><span style="">There were two other Roused in Alandal excluding her. She couldn&apos;t even fathom the level of power possessed by the first Roused. The other one was also quite excellent.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Even in the Roused Division, it is rare to see a physical Roused of your caliber. Soon, you&apos;ll be able to receive your Rank A.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Sunggoo frowned at the compliment given by Haesol.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;But I&apos;m a Mage?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;&#x2026;.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">What kind of a strange guild was this?</span></p><p></p></div><p></p>
