Queue is cleared. Thank you for the donation Erick. I didn&#x2019;t want to leave you guys on a huge cliff, so I&#x2019;ve been working non-stop since the last release.??

Thank you and enjoy.)</span></span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Is this the Temple of the Giants?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">At Woojin&#x2019;s words, Bibi&#x2019;s mouth dropped open as she took in the sight in front of her eyes.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ooh-wahng. I would believe it if someone told me this was a tomb.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;chet. Maybe.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin swallowed dryly as he looked at the statues ranging from several hundred to several thousand in number.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Let&#x2019;s go there first.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin returned ShingShing, then he walked with Bibi. Dolsae, the twitching ball of light, sat on top of Bibi&#x2019;s head.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Could these be used to make a golem?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The best way to find an answer to a question was to just do it. Woojin pointed with his finger. Dolsae flew towards a statue then he absorbed himself into it. The Statue shifted, and the body started to move.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Oh, it&#x2019;s working&#x2026; Nope.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Dolsae was flung out of the statue. Woojin frowned when he saw this.</span></p><p><span style="">Weeeeeng.</span></p><p><span style="">A dejected Dolsae was hugged by Bibi. The statue was already being controlled by something else, so Dolsae couldn&#x2019;t use the statue as its own body.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Just go eat some dirt.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Weeeng.</span></p><p><span style="">Dolsae absorbed into the ground, and he raised his body as a cloud of dust swirled around him. When Dolsae used the earth, his power was weaker than when his body was made out of stone, but the size of his body was twice as large.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;This is going to be a bit annoying.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Gooooong.</span></p><p><span style="">One by one the Giant Golems started to wake up. It wasn&#x2019;t as if all the golems had woken up. Only the nearest golems to him started waking up. It seemed this was an trap that will automatically activate when one gets within a certain range of the golems.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;So only 5 awoke?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Five Golems awoke when they sensed Woojin&#x2019;s intrusion. There weren&#x2019;t any corpses or spirits around, so most of his Necromancer Class Skills were useless. However, he didn&#x2019;t care.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Is it time to increase my Warrior Class Skills?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin summoned his Warrior&#x2019;s Weapon, then he changed its appearance to a hammer. He was quite used to the heavy weight of the weapon now.</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin raised his hammer, then he charged the Golems.</span></p><p><span style="">*</span></p><p><span style="">Lee-yunhwee was surprised. She had hidden her body inside a shadow.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;They were golems.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">She had made the right choice in turning back. Would she and her team mates be able to fight such a large number of golems? Maybe if they went in a straight line towards the altar, while defeating the nearby golems, then maybe it would have been possible.</span></p><p><span style="">However, what if she had she had seized the Return Stone, and the worst possible situation had happened? What would her team had done if all the golems attacked them at once? Moreover, there were living giants guarding the altar so they would have also had to deal with them.</span></p><p><span style="">As if Kahng-woojin was worried about such a scenario, he was killing all the golems first. He didn&#x2019;t head straight towards the altar. He destroyed the golems as he moved toward the center as if he was drawing a snail&#x2019;s shell.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Wasn&#x2019;t he a necromancer?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">It seems Kang-woojin had many secrets. It was no wonder the only information known about him was that he was a Necromancer. However, once she saw Kang-woojin hunt, she was suspicious as to whether he was really a Necromancer.</span></p><p><span style="">She was the Shadown Hunter yet she was suppressed with strength. It didn&#x2019;t make any sense. She had already been a Rank A Roused for 2 years, yet she was beaten in terms of strength&#x2026;.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;That bastard&#x2019;s Skeleton Summon must be a smokescreen. I&#x2019;m sure he is a Warrior. Moreover, he probably only advanced his strength.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin&#x2019;s appearance fit that image. He wielded a stupidly large hammer, and he bashed the Giant Golem as the Earth Golem held it in place.</span></p><p><span style="">Moreover, he was quite simple. He only used one technique.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Uh uh? What?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">After defeating couple hundred golems, Kang-woojin changed his style. He use his hammer to contiuously strike the floor.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;W&#x2026;what the hell? Is he some kind of construction worker&#x2026;.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">When Woojin moved further away, she advanced a little bit before she hid her body.</span></p><p><span style="">Kahng-woojin was on an infinite hunting spree, and Lee-yunhwee crawled low to the ground for awhile.</span></p><p><span style="">*</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hoo-ooh. Those bastards are getting on my nerve.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">He wasn&#x2019;t too far from the altar with the Return Stone floating on top of it.</span></p><p><span style="">There were less than 50 Giant Golems left, but the large giants surrounding the altar didn&#x2019;t even show signs of moving. With their backs to the Return Stone, they didn&#x2019;t budge an inch.</span></p><p><span style="">In the center of their heads, a single eye was rolling around. It meant they were observing Woojin.</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin didn&#x2019;t worry about the one-eyed freaks as he took care of the Giant Golems. It felt like he had spent over a whole day fighting the golems. Currently, the Return Stone was letting out a bright geen light as if it was about to explode. It probably meant it was almost time for the Dungeon Break.</span></p><p><span style="">His Warrior Class Skill level had increased drastically.</span></p><p><span style="">His repetitive movements slightly increased multiple Stats, and it was the result of the arduous time he had spent.</span></p><p><span style="">Moreover, he had already reached level 49. He had defeated every single golem&#x2026;.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ah,too bad. If master could have defeated one more golem, then you would have reached level 50. Then you could have played with your dolls.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I&#x2019;ll just have to defeat them.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin headed towards the Cyclops, who hadn&#x2019;t even moved an inch away from the altar.</span></p><p><span style="">Kooh-oong, koo-oohng.</span></p><p><span style="">Behind Woojin, Dolsae formed his body by aggregating the pieces of stone from the Giant Golems. As always, Bibi was riding on top of Dolsae&#x2019;s head.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Come down, Bibi. It&#x2019;s going to be dangerous.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Understood.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Cyclops were dangerous.</span></p><p><span style="">They were also one branch of a race descended from the Giant Race. However, one would be in trouble if one assumed they were comparable to the Ogres. Ogres had inherited the ferocious wild nature of the Giant Race, but the Cyclops had a larger body. Moreover, they had inherited the wisdom of the Giant Race, who once built a glorious civilization.</span></p><p><span style="">[I know you.]</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin stopped in front of the Cyclops.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;You know me?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">[Yes. The Charging Titan of Destruction.]</span></p><p><span style="">The Cyclop&#x2019;s gaze rested on the golem Dolsae, then it looked at the small Bibi next to him.</span></p><p><span style="">[Witch of Hallucination.]</span></p><p><span style="">The Cyclop&#x2019;s massive eye headed towards Woojin.</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin was laughing.</span></p><p><span style="">[I also know about your Dark Knights&#x2026;.]</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I guess I&#x2019;m a bit famous?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The Cyclops shifted when the heard Woojin&#x2019;s silly joke.</span></p><p><span style="">[How could I not know you? Necromancer of Massacre.]</span></p><p><span style="">The Cyclops moved both its hands.</span></p><p><span style="">[Terror of the Living.]</span></p><p><span style="">A golden mace was summoned on top of the Cyclops&#x2019; hand.</span></p><p><span style="">[King of the Dead.]</span></p><p><span style="">The other Cyclops on the side also summoned their maces. They took one step towards Woojin as they watched him.</span></p><p><span style="">[Alandal&#x2019;s Monarch.]</span></p><p><span style="">The 3 Cyclops raised their maces, and they took one more step.</span></p><p><span style="">[Immortal!]</span></p><p><span style="">Hooooong.</span></p><p><span style="">The Cyclops&#x2019; maces fell towards Woojin, but Dolsae was faster than them as he ran in.</span></p><p><span style="">Koong, koong.</span></p><p><span style="">Dolsae stretched his body to block the attack of the Cyclops.</span></p><p><span style="">Ggwahhhhng.</span></p><p><span style="">Various parts of Dolsae&#x2019;s body broke off, and stone dusts flew everywhere.</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin retreated slightly, then a smile formed at the corner of Woojin&#x2019;s mouth.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Did Trahnet also send you guys??&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">[You won&#x2019;t be able to block Trahnet&#x2019;s main army.]</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Bullshit.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">[The moment you decided to run away your defeat was determined.]</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin frowned in anger. He hadn&#x2019;t run away.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Do you want to die?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">[Your anger is the evidence of your defeat&#x2026;]</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin transformed his Warrior&#x2019;s Weapon into a spear.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Stop spouting bullshit.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin&#x2019;s body shot forward like a missile towards the Cyclops&#x2019; eye.</span></p><p><span style="">Pooh-ooh-ook.</span></p><p><span style="">The Spear stabbed into the Cyclops&#x2019; eye, but the Cyclop didn&#x2019;t try to avoid Woojin&#x2019;s strike. He instead grabbed Woojin out of the air. Woojin was caught in the Cyclop&#x2019;s hand, but he swirled around in place to escape the Cyclop&#x2019;s grasp.</span></p><p><span style="">Koo-oohng kwahng!</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin dodged the Cyclops&#x2019; indiscriminate blows, and he continued to attack. Each mace strike was deadly, and Woojin felt like he would rather face 100 Ogres. It was quite difficult to face off against 3 Cyclops.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hoo. This is driving me nuts..&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">He was having a difficult time avoiding each attack, and his occasional attack wasn&#x2019;t stacking any damage on them. It was quite useless. The Cyclops, who was stabbed in the eye, healed instantly from a light emitted by the altar.</span></p><p><span style="">He could use the Decisive Strike with his great sword to sever finger or the Achilles tendon, but it was all useless.</span></p><p><span style="">Bibi was almost of no help. It was only him and Dolsae. They were outnumbered, and time was running out.</span></p><p><span style="">The unknown power from the altar kept healing the Cyclops, so Woojin would eventually fatigue first.</span></p><p><span style="">At that moment, Lee-yunhwee appeared from a shadow cast by a pile of stone. Then she snatched the Return Stone on top of the altar. As if it was about to explode, the Return Stone emitted a bright light. However, when Lee-yunhwee grabbed it, the light calmed down.</span></p><p><span style="">At the same time, the light from the altar that was healing the Cyclops stopped flowing out.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hey, you son of a bitch. You can think of me as a small fry. This small fry is going home now. It would be great if you just died, you crazy son of a bitch.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin smiled when Lee-yunhwee appeared. Even trash had its uses in the right circumstance.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hey Dolsae. Buy me some time.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Gooh-uhhh.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin immediately exited the battlefield, then he charged towards Lee-yunhwee.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;W&#x2026;what are you doing? You crazy son of a bitch!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">This was the first time Lee-yunhwee saw Kahng-woojin struggle since he entered this Dungeon. He probably had enough, and he was trying to steal the Return Stone from her. It was probably why he was exposing himself, while he left the 3 Giants behind.</span></p><p><span style="">Maybe he meant to escape together with her using the Return Stone?</span></p><p><span style="">It didn&#x2019;t seem that way. The spear in Kang-woojin&#x2019;s hand frightened her.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;D&#x2026;don&#x2019;t come over here.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Thank you.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Kahng-woojin struck with his spear.</span></p><p><span style="">Kahhhhng.</span></p><p><span style="">She was barely able to block it, and Lee-yunhwee&#x2019;s wrists hurt. What kind of strength&#x2026;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;You will be my final EXP.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin aimed the spear toward Lee-yunhwee&#x2019;s heart.</span></p><p><span style="">A Rank Roused Lee-yunhwee. With her agile body, she twisted to perform her special attack, Cutting the Moonlight. Woojin didn&#x2019;t even try to avoid the attack. He charged in faster, and he struck with his spear.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;C&#x2026;crazy son of a bitch&#x2026;&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Her eyes were filled with shock. The life energy within her eyes faded quickly. When Woojin pierced her heart with his spear, she had grazed Woojin with her sword. The attack was insufficient to cut his throat.</span></p><p><span style="">Humans of blood and bones was much easier to deal with than the golems.</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin immediately learned the level 50 Restricted Skills and .</span></p><p><span style="">One can control a dead corpse.</span></p><p><span style="">The corpse can use 50% of its original ability.</span></p><p><span style="">It can only carry out simple directions.</span></p><p><span style="">Magic Consumption : 1,</span></p><p><span style="">The corpses within the caster&#x2019;s 10 meter radius or the corpse in control can be detonated.</span></p><p><span style="">The power is increased as more magic is consumed.</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin&#x2019;s magic caused Lee-yunhwee&#x2019;s corpse to suddenly stand up, and only the white of her eyes could be seen. Lee-yunhwee&#x2019;s corpse ran madly towards the golem.</span></p><p><span style="">As Woojin ran, he increased his main skill, Corpse Explosion, to level 10.</span></p><p><span style="">Lee-hyunhwee&#x2019;s body jumped, and the body attached itself to a Cyclops&#x2019; head. A large amount of magic exited Woojin, and the corpse exploded.</span></p><p><span style="">Ggwahhhhhg!</span></p><p><span style="">The explosion blew the Cyclops&#x2019; head right off. Then the fallen Cyclops got up, and the corpse hugged the other Cyclops.</span></p><p><span style="">Gwaaaahhhhg!</span></p><p><span style="">It was only two attack, but he had used up all of his magic.</span></p><p><span style="">The last remaining Cyclops tried to retreat, but Dolsae grabbed him.</span></p><p><span style="">In a flash, Woojin had approached the Cyclops and he was laughing.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;You said I ran away?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">[&#x2026;&#x2026;.]</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;If you guys are confident, then tell everyone to attack me.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">[&#x2026;&#x2026;.]</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin pierce the Cyclops&#x2019; eye with his spears.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Master. You aren&#x2019;t going to play with your doll-ahong??&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">When he looked at Bibi&#x2019;s bright smile, it really drove home the fact that she was a demon. Woojin suddenly laughed.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I&#x2019;m no different from her.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin wiped the blood flowing down his face. He used Soul Extortion to heal his wound.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Sss-oop. I think I&#x2019;ll have to apply some salve.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Yunhwee&#x2019;s attack had made a deep cut. He applied the Regeneration Salve on his throbbing wound. The scar will be completely gone after a night&#x2019;s rest.</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin picked up the Return Stone from the floor, then he quickly gathered the Artifacts.</span></p><p></p></div><p></p>
