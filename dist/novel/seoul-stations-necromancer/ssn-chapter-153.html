<p><span style="">Chapter 153 - Thrash&#x2019;s Protection (2)</span></p><p><span style="">Ggoo-ooh-oohg! </span></p><p><span style="">Dolsae&apos;s iron fist put his opponent on the floor.</span></p><p><span style="">Koong, koong. &#xA0;Hooooooohng, kwahng! </span></p><p><span style="">Dolsae&#x2019;s movement was unbefitting of his bulk. Dolsae took an agile leap to land on top of his opponent. &#xA0;Dolsae immediately put pressure on the head of his opponent. </span></p><p><span style="">[Koo-ooh-ooh.] </span></p><p><span style="">A drake was being squashed on the floor by Dolsae. &#xA0;It spread apart its alligator-like mouth to let out a moan.</span></p><p><span style="">Where the hell did such monsters show up from?</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin approached the drake, which was completely pressed to the ground under the weight of Dolsae.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Are you on the Yellow Lizard&apos;s side?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">[Goo-roo-rook. &#xA0;I&apos;m part of the Black Hats coalition.] </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Uh? I guess not all lizards join the Yellow Lizard coalition.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">[Goo-roo-roo-roo.] </span></p><p><span style="">Woojin shrugged his shoulder as he took off his cape.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Well, whatever.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">He draped the cape from the Thrash&apos;s Protection over the Drake&apos;s nose. &#xA0;He waited for something to happen, but nothing happened.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hmmm. Maybe it has to wear the cape.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">[Koo koo. &#xA0;You stupid bastard. &#xA0;You don&apos;t even have the Code, yet you took a cursed Items for yourself.] </span></p><p><span style="">Woojin tilted his head in puzzlement.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;You know what this is?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">[Isn&apos;t this an Item from Thrash&apos;s set?] </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ah, yes. What is the Code?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">[You aren&apos;t qualified&#x2026;&#x2026;. Do you think I&apos;ll just give you the answer so easily?] </span></p><p><span style="">It seemed the Drake knew it was done for, so it growled as it shut its mouth. &#xA0;Woojin smirked as he tapped its snout.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;This is why Drakes aren&apos;t included in the Dragon race. &#xA0;They are too dumb.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">[Goo-roo-roohk.] </span></p><p><span style="">Woojin turned to look at Dolsae.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Kill it.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">[Goo-uh-uh-uh.] </span></p><p><span style="">Kwah-ahng, kwahng-ahng, kwahng! </span></p><p><span style="">Dolsae&apos;s steel fists pounded on the head of the drake that was pinned underneath him. The head turned into a pulp as it burst open. &#xA0;Its body was swept up by a gray light before it disappeared.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Qualification.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">As Woojin was mumbling to himself, Death Knight Ramson approached Woojin.</span></p><p><span style="">[What do we do with the City, master?] </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Destroy it.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">[I do as the master desires.] </span></p><p><span style="">After Ramsom disappeared, Lich Jaenis appeared next to him. Woojin looked at the Lich in surprise.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I thought you were going to save the kids.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">[Goo-haha. &#xA0;I sent him ahead.] </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Sunggoo? Will he be enough?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">[He is enough.] </span></p><p><span style="">What? &#xA0;Sunggoo had already made that much progress? It had only been 3 days.</span></p><p><span style="">Anyways, Woojin asked Jaenis about something he was curious about.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Jaenis. &#xA0;You said these words when you became my familiar. &#xA0;You said I&apos;m special.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">[The lord is special.] </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Is that the reason why I won&apos;t die after wearing this?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Woojin held out the the Thrash&apos;s Protection in his grasp.</span></p><p><span style="">[&#x2026;&#x2026;yes. &#xA0;The Thrash&apos;s Curse veered away from you.] </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hmmm.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">He looked at Jaenis, who saw the downfall of Alphen for the past 200 years.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Was I the first one to take this?.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">[Twelve minions of Trahnet coveted it. &#xA0;All of them disappeared.] </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;They all died? Those bastards would have just come back to life.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">[They didn&apos;t just die. &#xA0;They ceased to exist.] </span></p><p><span style="">Woojin nodded his head.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Is this the reason why you wanted me to find Thrash&apos;s Executioner?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">The Relics he had gathered on Alphen had all been defensive gears. &#xA0;The Items were meant to protect him. However, he never acquired an Item that would cause harm to his enemies.</span></p><p><span style="">[Correct. &#xA0;In my opinion, that is the only course of action. &#xA0;It is also the reason why I volunteered to become your Familiar&#x2026;&#x2026;.] </span></p><p><span style="">Jaenis had turned himself into a Lich to save Alphen.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Well, all right. I&apos;ve never seen this Executioner, but if I kill all the Dimensional lords, I bet I can find it in one of their Storage.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Woojin wasn&apos;t hasty &#xA0;with his thoughts. &#xA0;He just had to find a clue. Of course, he had no idea if this weapon really existed, so his first order of business was to gather the rest of the Set Items.</span></p><p><span style="">[I have a request, master.] </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Well, what is it?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">[Do you think I can grow that bastard here?] </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Sunggoo?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">[In terms of magical talent, his senses might exceed master&#x2019;s...] </span></p><p><span style="">Ah. &#xA0;Somehow, he felt a little bit of jealousy. &#xA0;That bastard, Sunggoo. &#xA0;He was a talent that even Jaenis went out of his way to acknowledge.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;You do whatever you want.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">[I&apos;ll make master&apos;s first living underling.] </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Well, if he does die, will he be my second Lich?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">[That&apos;s not a bad idea.] </span></p><p><span style="">Woojin and Jaenis looked at each other as they grinned.</span></p><p><span style="">[Goo-haha. &#xA0;Then I&apos;ll go and watching his back now.] </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;All right. Go. &#xA0;When you get there, kill everyone who revives again.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Even if Woojin burned the Planet Jaku to the ground and clear all the Dungeons, new Dimensional lords will try to link here again. &#xA0;They would be good practice partners for him. &#xA0;He would be able to gain EXP for him. </span></p><p><span style="">Since he wanted to train, they were exactly what he was looking for.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I should head out after I catch couple more of them.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">The Dimensional domain&apos;s Protection Period was about to run out.</span></p><p><span style="">*** </span></p><p><span style="">The Colony fell.</span></p><p><span style="">The Holy Maiden carefully put away the Dimensional Fragment.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Whew. &#xA0;It&apos;s done.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Do-jaemin let out a sigh of relief as he flopped to the floor. Baek-jungdo had also pushed himself to the point of exhaustion. &#xA0;The two of them were always at the forefront, so their exhaustion had multiplied.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I&apos;m sorry for not being much of a help this time around.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Haesol expressed her sorriness through her apology. Her Taming ability wasn&#x2019;t great against intelligent races. &#xA0;It was more suited for the simple-minded monsters and the wild beasts.</span></p><p><span style="">If she had brought Jackson from earth, then she would have been in a better position to help. &#xA0;However, she hadn&apos;t, so her presence in the party had been greatly diminished. The only ability that was useful was her Telepathic ability, but it was only used to sync everyone&apos;s thoughts.</span></p><p><span style="">She had basically taken the role of a walkie-talkie. </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What is there to apologize for? &#xA0;If it wasn&apos;t for Ms. Haesol, we wouldn&apos;t have been able to recover so many spoils of war.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">The moles were disassembling the corpses, and they were were gathering the Bloodstones. &#xA0;There were also a growing pile of Items they had taken from the enemies.</span></p><p><span style="">It was an incredible amount of stuff. &#xA0;This wasn&apos;t an amount one could gather just from clearing one or two Dungeons on earth.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;We also have a lot of Artifacts now.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Blanka spoke excitedly as he activated his Detection Magic. &#xA0;The Artifacts were more important than the Bloodstones.</span></p><p><span style="">Currently, they were taking Items with hidden abilities. </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Whew. &#xA0;Let&apos;s rest a little bit before we explore. Lil bro Kahng said he&apos;ll be here.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes. However, do you think that Flame Roused will be ok?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Baek-jungdo smirked at Blanka&apos;s careful question.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Who? Mr. Sunggoo?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes. He seemed to be in an urgent....&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">After he burned the colony to the ground, he also burned the Dimensional lord to death. Then he was immediately chased away by the Lich. &#xA0;Sunggoo quickly disappeared into the distance. &#xA0;No, they just couldn&apos;t see him, but they could hear terrifying sounds of explosions coming from nearby. &#xA0;It seemed they weren&apos;t too far away from their location.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Don&apos;t worry about him. &#xA0;Mr Sunggoo is sturdy.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Huh huh. &#xA0;Still, I wonder if we should help him. &#xA0;The monster that was chasing after him looked very dangerous.&#x2026;&#x2026;.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Haesol laughed at Blanka&apos;s words.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;It isn&apos;t a monster. &#xA0;It is president&apos;s familiar. &#xA0;It is a Lich.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What? That was a Lich? &#xA0;It disappeared so fast...&#x2026;&#x2026;.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">He searched through his memory, and he thought he had caught a glimpse of the Lich. Blanka scratched his head. &#xA0;Haesol spoke as if to say he shouldn&apos;t worry about Sunggoo.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Normally, Mr. Sunggoo looks unreliable, but he&apos;s also the person, who lasted the longest next to our president.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;&#x2026;.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Blanka queried with his expression as if to say, &apos;Why would you say that?&apos; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Big incidents always occurs near the president. &#xA0;The fact that he is still alive is a big accomplishment in itself.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">His skill was unquestionable. &#xA0;Sunggoo had burned all the enemies to death at once. These were the monsters the party had struggled to kill.</span></p><p><span style="">Baek-jungdo licked his lips in regret.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;As expected, Magic is the way to go when kiting.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Why did his ability have to be Body Reinforcement&#x2026;&#x2026;. </span></p><p><span style="">Of course, it wasn&apos;t as if his ability was bad. &#xA0;Baek-jungdo was quite satisfied with himself. His Body Reinforcement ability was able to show its true worth during the night.</span></p><p><span style="">Jaemin thought Sunggoo had looked cool, but Sunggoo had a desperate expression on his face.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Let&apos;s join up with Sunggoo hyung after he finishes his training.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Huh huh. &#xA0;It seems we&apos;ll have to start training for real if we want to keep up with Mr. Sunggoo.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">They were all Rank A.</span></p><p><span style="">The Holy Maiden was Rank SS.</span></p><p><span style="">If Hong-sunggoo became a SS Ranked 9th Circle Master, the party members doubted whether they would be able to keep up with him.</span></p><p><span style="">In truth, the Holy Maiden was the only party member, who hadn&#x2019;t become exhausted. &#xA0;She was the main reason why they were able to hunt until now with the currently constructed party. &#xA0;Her healings and blessings had been a big boon.</span></p><p><span style="">Jaemin had retroactively become a vampire, and the problem was he wasn&apos;t compatible with the Holy Maiden. &#xA0;He couldn&apos;t gain any benefit from her.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Well, let&apos;s gather all the Artifacts.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Let&apos;s go.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">The moles tamed by Haesol could dig through the corpses to gather the Bloodstones, but they couldn&apos;t collect the Artifacts. &#xA0;They would have to do it themselves, so everyone stood up from their seats.</span></p><p><span style="">At that moment, Woojin suddenly showed up. </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;President!&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hyung-nim!&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Lil bro is here?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Woojin smirked when everyone was happy at his appearance. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;We haven&apos;t seen each other for only few days, yet you guys are this happy to see me? Were you on your way to loot?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Blanka shook his head from side to side at Woojin&apos;s words.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;We are going to gather the Items.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Don&apos;t be a hypocrite.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Woojin looked around his surrounding to see the Colony that had been burnt to the ground. There were monster corpses everywhere.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;You killed, destroyed, and took what you want.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;&#x2026;.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Wooin&apos;s words were correct, but Blanka had an unknown urge to deny it. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Looting is looting.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Did the president want to become a villain? Blanka felt a surge of anger, so he spoke out.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Are you trying to say we did something bad?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Woojin shrugged his shoulders.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;When did I say looting is bad?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;&#x2026;.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Blanka was having a hard time coming up with a retort.</span></p><p><span style="">Blanka wanted to give a counter-argument, but he couldn&apos;t come up with anything. &#xA0;There was no deceit on Woojin&apos;s face, and it was hard to guess what Woojin was thinking inside.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I&apos;m going to visit my Domain with Jaemin for a brief moment. &#xA0;What do the rest of you want to do?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Woojin asked for input from the party members.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Do you want to continue on here? &#xA0;Do you want to return to earth? &#xA0;We&apos;ve spent 4 days here, so only 1 day passed on earth.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Blanka rejoiced at Woojin&apos;s words.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;We can return?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Not you guys. &#xA0;I&apos;m asking what Jungdo hyung wants to do.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;&#x2026;.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&apos;Shit. He should have been clearer from the start.&apos;</span></p><p><span style="">Blanka pouted.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Mmm. &#xA0;I...&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Baek-jungdo looked at the party.</span></p><p><span style="">Everyone here was from Alandal.</span></p><p><span style="">There was no ulterior motive behind Woojin&#x2019;s question. &#xA0;He was wondering what Baek-jungdo&#x2019;s intended to do. &#xA0;He was an outsider.</span></p><p><span style="">Baek-jungdo shook his head from side to side.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I can&apos;t give up a hunting ground of this caliber.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">If he rolled with these people, Baek-jungdo&apos;s ability would increase. The caliber of monsters that showed up here was totally different from earth. &#xA0;Moreover, there was a lifeline here. &#xA0;The Holy Maiden would make sure no one would die here.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;All right. Let;s hunt, then we can head to earth to attend the Guild General Assembly.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Understood.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Then you guys loot the Items. &#xA0;I have a business I have to attend to. &#xA0;I&apos;ll be back soon.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">When Woojin waved his hand, a red portal opened in mid-air.</span></p><p><span style="">Zzeeeeeng. </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Let&apos;s go, Jaemin.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes, hyung.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Jaemin and Woojin disappeared after they passed through the portal.</span></p><p><span style="">Everyone knew where the portal was connected to.</span></p><p><span style="">It was Wooin&apos;s Dimensional Domain of Alandal.</span></p><p><span style="">He was someone, who could travel between planets. &#xA0;He was a human, who possessed a Dimensional Domain.</span></p><p><span style="">Baek-jungdo couldn&apos;t hold back his bitter laugh.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Maybe I&apos;m calling a god my bro.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">While the party was looting the Colony, Woojin and Jaemin arrived at the Dimensional Domain.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;We have 10 minutes left. &#xA0;You should relax and take it slow.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes, hyung. &#xA0;Also, I have a request...&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What is it?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Jaemin spoke carefully.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;May you loan me some Points?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Huh? What are you going to do with it?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I want to get some Items&#x2026;&#x2026;.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ah.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Woojin touched his chin as he thought about &#xA0;it. &#xA0;It was bad to rely on Items, but at a certain point, one had to be equipped befitting one&apos;s ability.</span></p><p><span style="">It was important to know how to use one&apos;s ability, but it was also important to learn how to use Items.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;The ones I gave you aren&apos;t enough?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">After Jaemin took the post of Strategist, he frequently won the Dimensional battles. Woojin gave a fixed amount of Points every time Jaemin won, so Jaemin should have amassed quite a lot of Points.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;There is something I&#x2019;ve been eyeing, but it&apos;s a little bit expensive.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;All right. Buy whatever &#xA0;you want.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes. &#xA0;Thank you.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;First, let&apos;s reset the Protection Period.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Yes, hyung.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Jaemin sat in the Strategist&apos;s seat, and Woojin sat on his Throne.</span></p><p><span style="">He wanted to find a suitable opponent before his Protection Period came to an end, so he opened the catalog to search for lords. &#xA0;It was at that moment when he saw it.</span></p><p><span style="">&lt;Dimensional lord Liah is requesting a Duel.&gt; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What? Is she alive now?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">She would be furious right now. &#xA0;Woojin couldn&apos;t help, but laugh when he thought about her.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;She is spunky.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Fools rush in where angels fear to tread.</span></p><p><span style="">It seemed she was blinded by anger and vengeance.</span></p><p><span style="">&lt;You&apos;ve accepted the Duel. &#xA0;You are being moved to the battlefield.&gt;</span></p>
