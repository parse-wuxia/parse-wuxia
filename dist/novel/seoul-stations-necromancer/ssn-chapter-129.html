<p><span style="">Chapter 129 - Liah</span></p><p><span style="">A woman with a black mask and sunglasses covering her face exited the arrival gate. There were a large group of people gathered there. &#xA0;Each of them held a camera in their hand, and at a glance, there were over 50 of them. &#xA0;However, not a single one of them paid attention to her. </span></p><p><span style="">They were like meerkats. &#xA0;They had their heads raised, and they kept looking at the arrival station.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Again?&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">The woman frowned as she walked past the reporters. &#xA0;When she got on the waiting van, she took off her mask.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Uh whew. &#xA0;Is it Kahng-woojin again?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Uh, Cindy. It seems so.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Cindy let out a sigh at the manager&apos;s words.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Why does he always come back from out of country when I&apos;m coming back?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ha ha.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">The manager could only laugh. &#xA0;Cindy wasn&#x2019;t being entirely truthful. Woojin wasn&apos;t scheduling his trips to foreign countries to coincide with her schedule.</span></p><p><span style="">It just happened to be that her schedule required her to visit China a lot. &#xA0;This was why she used the airport frequently, and occasionally, her homecoming coincided with Kahng-woojin&apos;s arrival.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Uh whew. Are these reporters unable to learn from their past experiences?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">How many times had Kahng-woojin used the the arrival gate to exit the airport? &#xA0;Most of the time he used different routes to exit the airport. &#xA0;She felt sorry for the reporters, who was waiting for him at the arrival gate out of stubborness.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;That is why reporters are lining up at every corner.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;&#x2026;.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Cindy&apos;s mouth dropped opened at the manager&apos;s words.</span></p><p><span style="">If reporters were covering every exit out of the airport, then how many people were out there? &#xA0;At the very least, there would be almost five times the number of reporters compared to the ones gathered at the arrival gate. &#xA0;It was a competition in coverage for a single person...</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;They are all simply here to take a picture? I heard he was infamous for not giving interviews.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Simply? &#xA0;He is the king of Alandal.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;King&#x2026;.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Cindy swallowed a groan. There was a kingdom within Korea now. &#xA0;It was ridiculous, since this wasn&apos;t a manhwa or a novel.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Huh. For real.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Celebrities lived in a different worlds compared to civilians. &#xA0;However, Kahng-woojin had transcended beyond the celebrities. &#xA0;She was a popular celebrity, yet Kahng-woojin looked as if he was from the stars.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I wonder if he will come to the school reunion.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Huh? What school reunion?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Cindy had mumbled to herself, but her manager asked her a question when he heard her. She shook her head as if it wasn&apos;t a big deal.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I didn&apos;t know about it before, but we went to the same high school.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Huk. Really? &#xA0;I doubt he&apos;ll go.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I thought so too.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Cindy cleared her palate as if she felt something was lacking. &#xA0;The previous school reunion had been rescheduled when the large-scale Dungeon Breaks happened in Seoul.</span></p><p><span style="">Afterwards, a large part of the population had left Seoul. &#xA0;There were some empty neighborhoods that made Seoul look like a ghost city.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Uh-whew. &#xA0;I have no idea.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">If they were fated to meet, she will meet him at least once... &#xA0;Cindy leaned backed into her seat, and she closed her eyes. </span></p><p><span style="">*** </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Uh uh? He&apos;s coming out!&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">They hadn&apos;t held high hopes, but the appearance of familiar faces from the arrival gate made the reporters go into a frenzy.</span></p><p><span style="">Chal-kahk chal-kahk! </span></p><p><span style="">A group of people walked out as they were serenaded by the flashes of the cameras.</span></p><p><span style="">It was Alandal&apos;s Hong-sunggoo and Woo-soonghoon. &#xA0;The group also included Baek-jungdoh and his secretary Jung-chansung. &#xA0;They were being escorted by the security.</span></p><p><span style="">Amongst the group, Sunggoo was the one, who had a wide smile on his face.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Heh heh. &#xA0;I&apos;m also famous now.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;If we exclude the president, director Hong is probably the hottest Roused around.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Sunggoo kept giggling as Woo-soonghoon kept trying to prop him up. </span></p><p><span style="">Before Woo-soonghoon got off the plane, he had put some BB cream on his face. &#xA0;Soonghoon was overdressed even for airport fashion. &#xA0;Soonghoon&apos;s appearance was what caused Sunggoo to laugh.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Chief Woo. You look good.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ha ha ha. &#xA0;Thank you. However, I&apos;m not the chief of the secretary office anymore. &#xA0;I&apos;m the minister of foreign affairs.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Heh heh. Now that I think about it you have come a long way in your career.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ha ha. Isn&apos;t it the result of dedicating my body and soul to the president?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Sunggoo laughed inside when he heard Soonghoon&apos;s words. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">Well, the first meeting hadn&#x2019;t been that pretty, and Soonghoon had suffered a lot.</span></p><p><span style="">Soonghoon put on a big smile as he took in the gazes of the reporters. He started waving his hand as if it was time for them to take his photos.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;You&apos;ve succeeded, Woo-soonghoon!&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">He had pumped up his own self-worth in his mind. </span></p><p><span style="">He was Alandal&apos;s minister of foreign affairs.</span></p><p><span style="">The eight years worth of memories he spent as a phone salesman flitted across his mind like a kaleidoscope. &#xA0;He never would have dreamed he would be this successful in life. He was filled with new emotions.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I&apos;m Jung-shinyoung from the KB Media. Please talk to us.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I&apos;m Lee-hosahn from the Today&apos;s Newspaper. Is it true that there is some friction with China?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">The reporters kept talking, so Woo-soonghoon excused himself from Baek-jungdoh. &#xA0;Woo-soonghoon stopped for a moment.</span></p><p><span style="">There was something he always wanted to do before. </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I&apos;ll take three questions.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">The reporters swarmed Soonghoon like bees when they heard his words. A very pretty female reporter was earnestly looking at him with earnest eyes, since she wanted to be picked. &#xA0;He pointed at her with his finger.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I&apos;m Lee-sheyun from the Jaeoong Media. Where is Mr. Kahng-woojin&#x2026;.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;He is the king of Alandal, so calling him Mr Kahng-woojin is a bit...&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Soonghoon frowned as he stopped her from speaking any further. &#xA0;For a moment, she was taken aback, but she continued to speak.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;where is the king of Alandal right now?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Was it because they had lived in a country where the monarchy had disappeared for a long time? &#xA0;No, this person wasn&apos;t descended from a royal line. &#xA0;He had established a new country, and he had proclaimed himself to be the king. &#xA0;No one had expected such a person to appear in the modern era.</span></p><p><span style="">Of course, they were having a hard time getting used to it.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;He is at the Dungeon.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Is he in a Dungeon in the US?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;No.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Soonghoon&apos;s answer put the reporters into a state of panic. Did Kahng-woojin go somewhere else, while the rest of his party came back home?</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Then when is he scheduled to come back?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Soonghoon smirked.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I have no idea. &#xA0;He might already be back in Alandal or he might come at a later date.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;&#x2026;?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">The reporters fell into a state of confusion when they heard Soonghoon&apos;s nonsensical answer. This was worth seeing. Soonghoon felt happy inside.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;This is the feeling.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">How many times did he want to imitate Kahng-woojin? </span></p><p><span style="">Soonghoon spoke his last line in a cool manner.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;This is at an end. &#xA0;That was three questions.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;E...excuse me. &#xA0;I want to ask one more question.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">The bummed out reporters rushed in towards Soonghoon, but the security guards cut them off immediately. &#xA0;After saying their goodbyes to the KH guild members, Sunggoo and Soonghoon headed towards the car sent by Alandal. Both of them looked at each other, and they laughed.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Soonghoon hyung. &#xA0;Did you just copy hyung-nim? &#xA0;You said you would only take three questions.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Sunggoo started to imitate how Woojin spoke. Soonghoon laughed in a bashful manner.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Haha. &#xA0;I always wanted to try it once.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Do you really think hyung-nim is back at Alandal?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I have no idea. &#xA0;He said he&apos;ll be there, so I just assumed it to be true.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Soonghoon had gained the ability to speak 10 languages thanks to Woojin. &#xA0;Therefore, Woojin&#x2019;s words was the law to Soonghoon. &#xA0;If he said sweet beans could be made into fermented beans, Soonghoon would believe it.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Let&apos;s go see. He really might have arrived there before us.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">The car with Sunggoo and Soonghoon onboard headed towards Alandal&apos;s territory. &#xA0;To be exact, they headed towards the Seoul Station&apos;s 1st Exit.</span></p><p><span style="">*** </span></p><p><span style="">The day before.</span></p><p><span style="">It was after he cleared the LA Dungeon, which had been the last destination on his schedule.</span></p><p><span style="">&lt;Level Up!&gt; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Hoo. &#xA0;I just have two levels left.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">He just need to level up twice to reach level 80. It was hard to call some of these Dungeons as being 6 stars.</span></p><p><span style="">There had been 5 Dungeons, where 7 star quality monsters had appeared.</span></p><p><span style="">If it wasn&apos;t for Woojin, they would have had the very first 7 star Dungeon Break on earth. It could have happened five times. The stationed army would have held the monsters in check, but the damage incurred would have been massive.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;A war of attrition is too dangerous.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">If earth became a battlefield, it would be dangerous. &#xA0;If they wanted to fight, they had to attack the Dungeons before the Breaks occurred. &#xA0;They had to end the fight at the Dungeons.</span></p><p><span style="">If they wanted to carry out this plan, they would need a large number of Roused. &#xA0;However, the quality of the Roused on Earth was poor.</span></p><p><span style="">The Rank AA or the 7th Circle Roused had only started to show up recently. &#xA0;They were appearing in ones and twos.</span></p><p><span style="">There had to be a lot of Roused on earth to be able to clear the Dungeons before the Breaks happened..... </span></p><p><span style="">Woojin wouldn&apos;t always be able to travel around the world to stop the Dungeon Breaks.</span></p><p><span style="">In the end, it had to be stopped with the help of everyone.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Well, in the end, I might have to let them fend for themselves.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">He had cultivated a weed like Sunggoo. It wasn&apos;t as if he needed a flower that could only be grown inside a greenhouse. He&apos;ll personally grow guys like Blanka, who showed great promise. &#xA0;The rest could grow on their own.</span></p><p><span style="">Each person should protect themselves. &#xA0;It was too dangerous to rely on others.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;It&apos;ll be dangerous if I take on the role of a nanny.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">There were already chatters proclaiming Woojin as the savior.</span></p><p><span style="">That was most definitely a dangerous signal.</span></p><p><span style="">If he wanted to foster the abilities of the Roused, he would have to trot them out by themselves. &#xA0;Of course, he had to stop Trahnet from swallowing the entirety of earth, so he would have properly control a force of Roused.</span></p><p><span style="">They would have to become the vaccine for the occasional Dungeon Breaks that would happen. &#xA0;Woojin would only have to take care of the serious monsters. </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;You guys head towards Korea first.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes? What about hyung-nim?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I&apos;ll travel using my own means. &#xA0;You guys head back first.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Woojin had to be present when a Dimensional Battle occurred in his Dimensional Domain. &#xA0;He immediately opened a portal to his Domain.</span></p><p><span style="">His base was the Seoul Station&apos;s 1st exit. &#xA0;It didn&apos;t matter where he was on earth. &#xA0;He could travel immediately back to his Dungeon.</span></p><p><span style="">He would be wasting a lot of time by crossing the Pacific Ocean on an airplane. &#xA0;He had traveled around the earth clearing Dungeons, and now his Dimensional Domain&apos;s Protection Period of 4 days was about to end. </span></p><p><span style="">After he left his party, Woojin immediately opened a portal.</span></p><p><span style="">Zzeeeeeng. </span></p><p><span style="">He was pretty much used to the queasiness now. He could see the hall containing his throne in the Dimensional Domain of Alandal.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Master!&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Bibi ran towards him, and she jumped into his arms. </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Nothing eventful happened?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes. Heh heh. &#xA0;Also, I&apos;m confident in my Dimensional Battle skills now.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Huh?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I received a surprise private lesson.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Private lesson? From whom?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Heh heh. &#xA0;It&apos;s a secret!&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Did a refugee with knowledge about the Dimensional Battle filter in?</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin checked the status of his Domain as if the task wasn&apos;t that important.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;The population has increased a lot.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes. Rumors has spread that we don&apos;t charge resettlement fees. On the other hand, we haven&apos;t opened up the Dungeon for them to use, so most of the battle-capable refugees are gone.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Woojin refused to open the only Dungeon he possessed. &#xA0;He hadn&#x2019;t lifted the restriction placed on the Seoul Station&apos;s 1st exit.</span></p><p><span style="">The Domain residents couldn&#x2019;t hunt humans or gather Bloodstones. These activities were only possible if they could pass through the Dungeon to Earth. &#xA0;Since they weren&apos;t able to do that, the warlike refugees just passed through Alandal.</span></p><p><span style="">The refugees that had settled down in Alandal were travelers, who were tired of wandering. They had the propensity of being peaceful.</span></p><p><span style="">Even if the Dungeon wasn&#x2019;t released, it wasn&apos;t as if they couldn&apos;t profit from gathering Bloodstones.</span></p><p><span style="">It just couldn&apos;t be earned all at once. &#xA0;One could gain some profit by farming for Bloodstones. &#xA0;One could also hunt or rear the monsters.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;We have only 2 minutes left.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Heh heh. &#xA0;I&apos;m confident this time.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">The confident Bibi smirked as she looked at Woojin. &#xA0;If she won, he would get penalized with a 4 day Protection period.</span></p><p><span style="">The Dimensional Battle was a strategic battle fought using the power of one&apos;s Domain.</span></p><p><span style="">Duel was a battle using the Domain lord&apos;s martial prowess.</span></p><p><span style="">The end result was the same for both battles. &#xA0;One would get a 12 day Protection Period only if one lost.</span></p><p><span style="">If one won, one would only get 4 days of Protection Period. &#xA0;During this time, if one requested a battle to another force, the protective barrier around the Domain would disappear. &#xA0;The only exception to these conditions was when one conducted a Revenge after a loss.</span></p><p><span style="">The best case scenario was for Bibi to lose, so he could gain the 12 days Protection Period. &#xA0;Then he would conduct his Revenge, and he would regain his stolen Points and Items.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Heh heh. &#xA0;It&apos;ll be great if we can start soon.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Bibi had high expectations for herself. &#xA0;He could imagine her being sad in her defeat. &#xA0;He felt sorry for her, but he had no choice.</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin didn&apos;t want to go through the frustrating Dimensional Battle again. He wouldn&apos;t subject himself to that torture.</span></p><p><span style="">&lt;The Protection Period has ended.&gt; </span></p><p><span style="">&lt;You will be able to receive Dimensional Domain Battle requests. &#xA0;You will be able to receive Duel requests.&gt; </span></p><p><span style="">&lt;You can refuse up to three times. &#xA0;Afterwards, it will proceed forcefully.&gt; </span></p><p><span style="">Woojin sat on his Throne for a brief moment when he received numerous requests for Dimensional Battle. &#xA0;He just picked one at random.</span></p><p><span style="">&lt;The Dimensional Battle with Liah has started.&gt; </span></p><p><span style="">Woojin sat on his throne, and his vision widened.</span></p><p><span style="">At a glance, he could survey a large stretch of land. &#xA0;He was able to take in the progress of battle between Bibi and the other Dimensional lord at the same time. &#xA0;During the battle, Woojin checked the profile of his opponent.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;She&#x2019;s a human?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">The race of his opponent was listed, but there was no way to find out what abilities or forces she possessed. The only thing he could find out was limited to her records.</span></p><p><span style="">&lt;Dimensional Domain 102W 542L&gt; </span></p><p><span style="">&lt;Duel 640W 230L&gt; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ho! This looks like it&apos;ll be fun.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">It seemed this person operated in a similar style as Woojin. &#xA0;This person had more Duel wins than Dimensional Battle wins.</span></p><p><span style="">It basically meant his opponent was a battle type Dimensional lord. &#xA0;There was no reason why he should get scared by looking at his opponent&apos;s record. &#xA0;He wasn&apos;t afraid of death. &#xA0;Even if the 72 Thrones came after him, he wouldn&apos;t hesitate to carry out his Revenge.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Bibi seems to be holding out.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Even after a long time passed, the battle wasn&apos;t ending, so Woojin checked his map.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Huh.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Woojin looked as if he didn&apos;t know whether to laugh or cry. He had an odd expression on his face.</span></p><p><span style="">Did she really get a lesson from a well-known private tutor? &#xA0;The flow of the battle started to head towards an odd direction.</span></p>
