<p><span style="">Chapter 145 - Alandal in Seoul</span></p><p><span style="">He stood opposite of Liah on a frozen land.</span></p><p><span style="">He had expected her to be enraged, but Woojin&apos;s prediction was way off. Liah didn&apos;t mince words. &#xA0;She brought up the reason as to why she was here.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Do you mind if I make you an offer?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;You challenged me to a Duel, yet you want to give me an offer?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I don&apos;t have a point of contact on the planet anymore. &#xA0;You destroyed all the footholds I had on Planet Jaku.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">If one wanted to visit the Dimensional domain of others, one had to go to their Dungeons. &#xA0;This was why the only way she could meet with Woojin was through Dimensional battle or Duel.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;So you want to give me an offer instead of pursuing your revenge?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;After I was revived, I heard the news on what happened. In truth, I was a little bit surprised. You seem to have the power to act with reckless bravado in regards to protecting your planet.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Reckless bravado&#x2026;.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ah, sorry. It doesn&#x2019;t matter of if you are strong or not. &#xA0;You are trying to do an impossible task.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Are you desperate to be killed again?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Woojin took out his Warrior&apos;s Weapon. Her method of battle was probably the same as before. &#xA0;She wasn&apos;t smoking a cigarette this time, but he thought she was trying to buy time through their conversation.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Woah. &#xA0;Calm down. I&apos;m suggesting an alliance. Instead of crossing swords with a person of significant power, it would be more beneficial for me to join up with you.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Don&apos;t you have any pride? &#xA0;How much did you lose to me?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;If I can get an alliance with someone as strong as you, it is a small amount of Points to pay.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;&#x2026;.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Woojin&apos;s eyebrows twitched.</span></p><p><span style="">He couldn&apos;t understand her. &#xA0;She was putting out her hand towards a man, who had killed her. &#xA0;He had destroyed her Colony, and he had killed all her subordinates and Domain residents. &#xA0;However, it seemed she thought all of them in terms of Points.</span></p><p><span style="">They were items she could purchase once again after she gained more Points.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I refuse.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Woojin grabbed his axe.</span></p><p><span style="">Liah laughed.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;You can&apos;t refuse me.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;&#x2026;?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I can&apos;t win against you. &#xA0;However, the humans around you is a different matter.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;&#x2026;.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Woojin headed towards her with his axe in his hand.</span></p><p><span style="">However, Liah didn&apos;t even flinch at his approach.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Isn&apos;t that a pretty lame threat?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Woojin raised his axe.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Do you really think you&apos;ll be able to block all the links from forming on earth? &#xA0;&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">It seemed he had an incredible amount of confidence in himself.</span></p><p><span style="">A single person was thinking about defending against countless Dungeons.</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin snorted at the invidious remark. </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I&apos;m sure some will break through.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;&#x2026;?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">This was the first Liah&apos;s expression changed.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;So why won&apos;t you accept my offer? &#xA0;You don&apos;t mind if the people around you die?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;It isn&apos;t all right.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">He had his family, and Sooah. &#xA0;Then there were the people of Alandal that he had somewhat gotten attached to. &#xA0;He had to protect them. &#xA0;This was the goal Woojin had set for himself.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Then why&#x2026;.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Even if it isn&apos;t you, I have a truck-full of bastards threatening me.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;&#x2026;!&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Next time, you should attack me with some more spirit.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Woojin split open Liah&apos;s head with his axe. It really seemed she had no intention of fighting from the start. &#xA0;Liah allowed herself to be defeated easily, and she was reduced to a gray light. </span></p><p><span style="">&lt;You&apos;ve won the Duel.&gt; </span></p><p><span style="">&lt;You will now be able to initiate the Victor&#x2019;s Rights.&gt;</span></p><p><span style="">&lt;Please select either Loot the Storage Room or Loot the Domain.&gt;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;That was an easy win. &#xA0;I choose Loot the Storage Room.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">If he could get something like the Skia&apos;s Boots, which was a main ingredient in making Thrash&apos;s Set item, he would be thrilled. &#xA0;If he could get a precious treasure, it would be more profitable than looting a Domain.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Well, my situation will remain the same even if I took out that bitch from the equation.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Liah wasn&apos;t the only one gunning for Woojin.</span></p><p><span style="">Even if he was to appease her, there were still a lot of enemies left.</span></p><p><span style="">He also would be allying himself with someone, who would betray him at every turn. &#xA0;It would be better for him to have her remain as an enemy.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I have to step on her&#x2026;.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Woojin smacked his lips. &#xA0;The best place to loot was at a Dimensional domain or a Colony of the dead lord. If he knew the location of another Colony or Dungeon owned by Liah, he would have immediately gone there to loot what she had. &#xA0;It was too bad.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Tsk. She doesn&apos;t have any good Items.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">He was left with possession of mediocre Items. &#xA0;&#xA0;After the Loot was complete, Woojin&#x2019;s sight returned to his own Dimensional Domain. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">Jaemin was waiting with a confused expression on his face. &#xA0;He asked Woojin a question.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Should we do another Dimensional battle, hyung?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;No. We gained the necessary Protection Period.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">He would gain 4 days if he won the Duel or Dimensional battle. &#xA0;If he lost, he would gain 12 days.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Then the Points&#x2026;.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;You can borrow from me. &#xA0;How much do you need?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">When they had some spare time, he was going to use Jaemin to gain Points through Dimensional battles. &#xA0;It wouldn&#x2019;t be bad to give him the Points in advance.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I need 170,000 Points.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Huh?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">The figure was much higher than expected. &#xA0;At Woojin&apos;s response, Do-jaemin scratched the back of his head.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I guess it would be difficult?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">It was enough Points to be able to buy a decent Dimensional Domain.</span></p><p><span style="">The amount wasn&#x2019;t the problem, and Woojin didn&#x2019;t mind giving it to him.</span></p><p><span style="">Sunggoo, Jaemin and the people around him had to grow. &#xA0;This would allow them to protect his family and Alandal when a group composing of Dimensional lords like Liah shows up.</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin wasn&#x2019;t like some poltergeist that&#x2019;ll always stick around in one place.</span></p><p><span style="">It&#x2019;s just that he was curious as to what Jaemin wanted so bad that he was willing to spend so much Points on it.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What are you trying to buy?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I want the Vampire Lord&apos;s Heart.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Woojin wondered if he had misheard Jaemin.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I&apos;ll slowly save up and buy it later.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Jaemin regretted his decision to ask, since it felt like he was making an unreasonable request. Kahng-woojin had already done so much for him, and it felt like he was taking advantage of Woojin&#x2019;s generosity.</span></p><p><span style="">Jaemin had felt his weakness deep within his bones. &#xA0;His request must have arose from the desperation at wanting to get stronger.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Wait a moment.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">He looked through his Dimensional Store, and he found the Vampire Lord&apos;s Heart.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;It really is priced at 200,000.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">It seemed Jaemin had saved up 30,000 Points, but he was strapped for Points at the moment.</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin purchased it.</span></p><p><span style="">&lt;Vampire Lord&apos;s Heart&gt; </span></p><p><span style="">Count Kiet&apos;s Heart.</span></p><p><span style="">His previous Rank will be passed on.</span></p><p><span style="">Originally, Jaemin had been bitten by a low level Vampire, and he had become a thrall. &#xA0;Jaemin had killed the Vampire, and he initiated the Blood Ritual to steal the Vampire&#x2019;s power to become one.</span></p><p><span style="">Still, there was a cap to his growth no matter how much blood he drank.</span></p><p><span style="">If he wanted to become a high ranked Vampire, he had to go through another Blood Ritual.</span></p><p><span style="">A heart of a Vampire noble. </span></p><p><span style="">Jaemin was aiming for the heart of a lord. &#xA0;The Vampire had to have a station of Count at minimum.</span></p><p><span style="">Once a Vampire becomes a lord, it could use Blood Relations to command the lower ranked Vampires.</span></p><p><span style="">This wasn&apos;t a case where he would only be able to command the bloodsucking monsters. &#xA0;He&apos;ll be able to gain underlings from the same race as him.</span></p><p><span style="">The lord was given the qualification to start a Vampire clan.</span></p><p><span style="">Even if one didn&apos;t covet having the underlings, a lord&apos;s growth potential was on a different level. &#xA0;If one had the potential to reach 100, the potential would grow two to three times larger as a lord.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Eat it.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;thank you.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Woojin held up the heart as if it was nothing, and Jaemin didn&apos;t refuse the offer.</span></p><p><span style="">He could show his thanks in the future with his life. &#xA0;Currently, he needed power, and the heart in front of him was the means.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Once you finish the ritual, you should return to Planet Jaku, and try to imbibe as much blood as possible. I&apos;ll be heading to a different planet soon.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Another planet?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Alphen.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ah.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Jaemin was well versed with the Planet Alphen. He had become close with the Holy Maiden, since they hunted in the same party. &#xA0;She kept talking about her home planet until his ears had hurt.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Are you going to hunt more, hyung?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;You should worry about yourself rather than worrying about me. </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hurry up and do the ritual.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Woojin stayed for the off chance that the Blood Ritual could go wrong, then he head to earth. &#xA0;It wasn&#x2019;t as if Planet Jaku was the only hunting ground available to Woojin. &#xA0;It was still important for him to clear Dungeons that couldn&#x2019;t be handled by anyone on earth.</span></p><p><span style="">He wouldn&#x2019;t be able to come back for several days if he went to Alphen.</span></p><p><span style="">He&#x2019;ll have to leave after clearing the Dungeons that are about to break.</span></p><p><span style="">Sss-ahhhhhh. </span></p><p><span style="">Even in death, the heart was beating. &#xA0;When Jaemin grabbed the heart, blood shot out as it formed a fog of blood, and it was directly absorbed into Jaemin. &#xA0;After the ritual was done, it felt as if something had changed. &#xA0;However, the change was marginal.</span></p><p><span style="">Jaemin was a bit out of step as he stepped out of the starting block. &#xA0;However, every time he took a step, the change that would occur would become bigger. &#xA0;He&#x2019;ll get to taste a growth that couldn&#x2019;t be compared to before.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Good luck.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes, hyung.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Jaemin was different from his previous self. &#xA0;His face was overflowing with confidence. &#xA0;After Jaemin gave his goodbye, he stepped through the portal heading toward Planet Jaku. &#xA0;Woojin entered into a Portal heading towards Seoul Station&#x2019;s 1st exit.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Uh? President&#x2026; You are back already, my king?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">The employee guarding the Seoul Station&apos;s 1st Exit greeted Woojin.</span></p><p><span style="">The title of king was awkward for most people. but Woojin really didn&apos;t care.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Where&apos;s Soonghoon?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;The minister of foreign affair went to the headquarters when he heard the guests from overseas had arrived.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Is that so?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Shall I contact him right now?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;No. It&apos;s fine. It&apos;s right around the corner.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Woojin&#x2019;s stepped out of the exit, and he was showered with clicks from the reporters on a stakeout.</span></p><p><span style="">He headed towards Alandal&#x2019;s main building.</span></p><p><span style="">*** </span></p><p><span style="">In the building considered to be the headquarters, a portion of the building was designated to be the Foreign office.</span></p><p><span style="">Amongst the office spaces, Woo-soonghoon had an office as the minister of foreign affairs.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Heeyah. They want a lot of stuff.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Soonghoon saw the negotiators sent by each country, and he shook his head from side to side. The men here still seemed to be unaware of who was holding the hilt of the sword.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Minister. The delegation has arrived at the prime minister&apos;s office.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hmm. All right. Let&apos;s go.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Soonghoon and the employee left for the prime minister&apos;s office.</span></p><p><span style="">Alandal&apos;s prime minister Jung-minchan, a director from Japan&apos;s Kaneda guild, and the delegation from Britain was already present inside the room.</span></p><p><span style="">[It is nice to meet you. &#xA0;My name is Soonghoon. &#xA0;I&apos;m the minister of foreign affairs.] </span></p><p><span style="">Woo-soonghoon spoke in flawless English as he greeted everyone.</span></p><p><span style="">There was no awkwardness to his speech, and a translator was unnecessary.</span></p><p><span style="">Soonghoon sat next to Jung-michan, and Minchan quietly whispered into his ear.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Minister Woo. &#xA0;This negotiation is...&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Prime minister.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Soonghoon looked at Minchan with a straight face.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Please trust in me. Let me handle the negotiation.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Huh?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Minchan had a serious expression on his face as he looked at Soonghoon. &#xA0;For a moment, he struggled over the decision, but he nodded his assent in the end. </span></p><p><span style="">The position makes the person. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">Woo-soonghoon was different from his previous self.</span></p><p><span style="">When they were finalizing Alandal&apos;s treaty, Soonghoon had worked in lockstep with him. &#xA0;This was why Michan thought Soonghoon wouldn&apos;t make any big mistakes even if he wasn&apos;t a professional negotiator.</span></p><p><span style="">He&#x2019;ll stay to see if there were unforseen problems. &#xA0;He would be able to immediately make corrections if needed.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;All right. &#xA0;I still have to make the final decision, so you&#x2019;ll have to discuss it with me.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Of course.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Aside from the king, the Prime Minister personally dealt with the day to day running of Alandal. &#xA0;He had the power akin to a president, and Minchan&#x2019;s influence in Alandal was absolute.</span></p><p><span style="">Alandal was a small country, but the country had the power to influence the world. &#xA0;As the first Prime Minister of Alandal, many countries were interested in him.</span></p><p><span style="">Soonghoon sat in front of the person from Japan&apos;s Kaneda guild.</span></p><p><span style="">[I&apos;ve read all the data and requests you provided us. &#xA0;Let us discuss the issue of giving a fair warning when a 6 star and above Dungeon shows up. &#xA0;We also have to negotiate the joint clearing of&#x2026;.] </span></p><p><span style="">Soonghoon was skillful in taking the lead, so Minchan nodded his head in approval inside. Soonghoon was meticulous in gathering data, and he was adept at stealing away the initiative in the negotiations.</span></p><p><span style="">Soonghoon was well aware of the fact that Alandal held the absolute high ground in regards to Dungeons when talking to other guilds and countries. &#xA0;He used this fact well in the negotiations.</span></p><p><span style="">After coming to a mutual aid agreement regarding Dungeon clearing with the Kaneda guild, they finalized on the stake Alandal would have on the cleared Dungeons. &#xA0;After that negotiation came to an end, Soonghoon faced the United States&#x2019; Bad Sector guild.</span></p><p><span style="">[I&#x2019;m sure the president will decline the offer you made in regards to making a movie. &#xA0;Moreover, Alandal is currently in an alliance with the Titan guild&#x2026;.] </span></p><p><span style="">They had been having an intense conversation for over 30 minutes, yet they weren&#x2019;t even close to coming to an agreement. &#xA0;Soonghoon decided to push the negotiations to a different date.</span></p><p><span style="">[Hoo. &#xA0;We&apos;ll start the negotiation again tomorrow.] </span></p><p><span style="">Bad Sector was the second biggest guild in the US behind the Titan.</span></p><p><span style="">The negotiation hadn&apos;t been easy.</span></p><p><span style="">Soonghoon sat in front of the delegation from Britain. &#xA0;He frowned.</span></p><p><span style="">[You guys didn&#x2019;t send any data our way, and you just dropped in on us. &#xA0;What is the reason behind this move?] </span></p><p><span style="">[President Kahng-woojin said to come to Alandal...] </span></p><p><span style="">[Uh-huh! He is our monarch.] </span></p><p><span style="">[I did as king Kahng-woojin instructed. &#xA0;He told me to talk to the people within his own country. &#xA0;This is why we came here.] </span></p><p><span style="">[Ah. &#xA0;So the president sent you here.] </span></p><p><span style="">Woo-soonghoon&#x2019;s expression relaxed a little bit.</span></p><p><span style="">[All right. &#xA0;Why are you here?] </span></p><p><span style="">[I&#x2019;ll go straight to the point. &#xA0;We want to purchase the Dimensional Fragment.] </span></p><p><span style="">[Ah. &#xA0;You are here to purchase an Item.] </span></p><p><span style="">[Yes. I was told to negotiate with Alandal.] </span></p><p><span style="">Ah. &#xA0;Did president finally recognize Woo-soonghoon&#x2019;s skill? &#xA0;The president even entrusted him with this work. &#xA0;He was so happy that the question just fell out of his mouth.</span></p><p><span style="">[ALl right. &#xA0;What price did you have in mind?] </span></p><p><span style="">[The king of Alandal suggested a price to us. He wanted an aircraft carrier for it.] </span></p><p><span style="">[What? &#xA0;What did you just say?] </span></p><p><span style="">Soonghoon thought he had misheard, so he repeated his question. &#xA0;Jung-minchan looked at him with surpised eyes.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;What is this Dimensional Fragment? Is it suppose to be something precious?&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">He didn&#x2019;t even have to voice the question out loud. &#xA0;Soonghoon fiercely asked the question with his surprised expresssion. </span></p>
