<p><strong>Chapter 79 Rashmode .</strong></p><div id="chapterContent" class="innerContent fr-view"><p><span style="">Chapter 79 - Rashmode</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p><p><span style="">His rage was expressed as a catastrophe. He swept across the area.</span></p><p><span style="">Too too too too!</span></p><p><span style="">The propeller spinning on Dolsae&apos;s left arm cut a wolf-like monster in half. The propeller was strengthened with magic, so it was akin to spinning blades.</span></p><p><span style="">When the blood of the wolf flew everywhere, it signalled the beginning of the battle.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Koo-ohhhh!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Dolsae let out a roar and headed towards the monsters.</span></p><p><span style="">Kwahng, kwahng!</span></p><p><span style="">Every time the steel giant took a step, a large crater was formed on the ground. The vibration caused the bolts on his body to fall off in droves.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Kwahhhhk!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Dolsae was unreserved even as several hundred monsters all ran at him.</span></p><p><span style="">Kwahng! Kwah-jeek!</span></p><p><span style="">Every time Dolsae swung his fist, a monster&apos;s head exploded. Moreover, the rotating blades broke the formation of the monsters as it cut apart their bodies.</span></p><p><span style="">Pshooooong!</span></p><p><span style="">The Missile attached to his back shot high into the sky. It fell and exploded near the rear of the group, the most dense spot of monsters. The members of the Rivers organization, who hadn&apos;t had the time to run away, were swept up in the explosion, but Dolsae couldn&apos;t stop his destructive instinct.</span></p><p><span style="">The Holy Knights looked on dumbly at the sight. Dolsae was going nuts in the midst of the monsters, like a crazy bull.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Wow. Is he a transformer?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What a cool ability!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Jimmy would throw away his Flight and Quick Sword abilities if he could have such an ability.</span></p><p><span style="">They said he was a Steel Golem&#x2026;.</span></p><p><span style="">Isn&apos;t he just a robot?</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Look at his cannons.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The cannons mounted on Dolsae&apos;s shoulders fired as it shot down a flying monster that was far distance away. Some Holy Knights even started to clap as Dolsae sniped his enemies.</span></p><p><span style="">However, not all of the Holy Knights were robot enthusiast.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Why are you standing here like idiots? Go hunt the monsters!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">James, the leader of the Holy Knight, angrily scolded his men. The Holy Knights quickly readied themselves for battle. When two of the monsters headed towards them, all the Holy Knights unsheathed their weapons.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;May the goddess&apos; blessing be with you.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Pah-pah-paht.</span></p><p><span style="">When the goddess Aria&apos;s blessing was cast, the Holy Knights&apos; fighting power was increased significantly. If you were a B Rank Roused, Melody&apos;s buff would elevate you to Rank A. Moreover, there were those who could exhibited even more power than that.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;It&apos;s been awhile. Should we go hunt?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The Holy Knights were about to step forward when the two monsters casted their shadows over them. Then....</span></p><p><span style="">Kooh-oong!</span></p><p><span style="">Both of Dolsae&#x2019;s feet fell from the sky and drove the two monsters deep into the ground. The monsters were probably crushed to death.</span></p><p><span style="">Hoooooohng.</span></p><p><span style="">The shock wave caused dirt to fly everywhere. Naturally coarse words poured out of their mouths.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Shit.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What the hell is this?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">After falling from the sky, Dolsae extended his hand towards the Holy Knights.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What the hell? He doesn&apos;t want us to butt in?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Ggi-gee-gee-geek.</span></p><p><span style="">The sound of metals grating against each other was heard every time Dolsae moved. He turned back to look at the monsters. The Holy Knights shook their head as they looked at Dolsae&apos;s large back. Then, they turned to the Holy Maiden.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Aren&apos;t we allies?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;&#x2026;.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What should we do?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Please just wait.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">It was what the Titan of Destruction had wanted&#x2014;to face the monsters by himself. She didn&apos;t know his reason, but she decided it would be best to let Dolsae do what he wanted.</span></p><p><span style="">If they unnecessarily butted in, then they might have to face the Titan of Destruction instead of the monsters.</span></p><p><span style="">Kwah-kwah-kwahng!</span></p><p><span style="">The Titan of Destruction charged towards the monster, while letting out a heavy sound with every step he took. Instead of being worried about the Dolsae, she was worried about Woojin, who had headed towards an unfavorable battlefield.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;I worry about the Immortal.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">The Holy Maiden shook her head at her own absurd thoughts.</span></p><p><span style="">He could take care of himself.</span></p><p><span style="">He went by himself since he was confident in himself.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Everyone please get ready.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The Holy Knights were confused by the Holy Maiden&apos;s words.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Mmm. Isn&apos;t our steel friend going to block our way?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;He won&apos;t be able to regenerate after he uses up all of his magic.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Magic was consumed when the body was first formed. Moreover, magic was consumed when Dolsae had to regenerate the broken pieces of his body. Woojin had transferred all of his magic to Dolsae, but it will eventually run out.</span></p><p><span style="">Even now, he was regenerating his armor that had been torn away by a monster. He pulled the roof of a new vehicle to repair himself. His magic was being consumed incrementally, but there were still couple hundred monsters left.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;If the Titan of Destruction falls, then I have no idea where the monsters will head towards.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Currently, the monsters were acting like trained pack of hunting dogs. The monsters converged and attacked a single target. This was possible since the monsters had yielded to the authority of commander Rashmode.</span></p><p><span style="">After the monsters took down their target, they&apos;d be released from Rashmode&apos;s control. They would return to being wild and violent monsters.</span></p><p><span style="">This situation would basically turn into something akin to a normal Dungeon Break.</span></p><p><span style="">Even if a single monster escaped, it would be disastrous.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;That Steel Golem has to last as long as he can.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Guild master Deacon let out a moan.</span></p><p><span style="">His support team should be on their way here now. He had been worried that he would have to buy time with only the Holy Knights by his side, so her words were a welcome sound.</span></p><p><span style="">He wished for the Steel Golem to last until his support team arrived.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;So who was the person Mr. Kahng-woojin followed after?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Person?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The Holy Maiden furrowed her brows. She could see how Rashmode could be seen as a person through human eyes. However, he was a terrible demon.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;He is one of Trahnet&apos;s 72 commanders....&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">That was his real identity.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Black Magician Rahsmode.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Melody&apos;s worried eyes moved towards the entrance of the underground Dungeon.</span></p><p><span style="">*</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin slowly descended the Dungeon&apos;s underground stairway.</span></p><p><span style="">There weren&apos;t that many stairs, and at the end of the tight space existed a red portal.</span></p><p><span style="">It was structured the same as a high rank Dungeon.</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin didn&apos;t hesitate and passed through the portal.</span></p><p><span style="">Pah-paht.</span></p><p><span style="">When the light disappeared, a large underground cavern was revealed. It was like a Dragon&apos;s lair. It was twice as large as a soccer stadium.</span></p><p><span style="">&lt;You&apos;ve entered Rahsmode&apos;s Research Lab.&gt;</span></p><p><span style="">&lt;You are attempting &#x2018;Assault&#x2019; mode.&gt;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What the hell is this?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The sound of the Dungeon Entrance Announcement was a bit different. He guessed it had meant that he entered a Dimensional Domain possessed by someone else.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Kooh-hahah. You dumb bastard. You really followed after me.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Rashmode let out a cheerful laugh.</span></p><p><span style="">He had known that the impatient Necromancer was very spontaneous and random in his actions. However, he had never expected the Necromancer to fall so easily to his vulgar provocation.</span></p><p><span style="">He had sent sent out all of his underlings to fill up the Dungeon. Even if he had tried to hold a numerical advantage, the Necromancer would use them as mediums to make his Skeleton Soldiers.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;You are only a Necromancer. What can you do without corpses?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;At the very least, I&apos;ll be able to kill a bastard like you.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Koo-haha. Your bravado is still the same even though you&apos;ve gone through Initialization.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Aren&apos;t you too confident as well, even though you don&apos;t have your Chimeras?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Rashmode used to be a very famous Black Magician on Alphen.</span></p><p><span style="">He received immortality after he submitted to Trahnet. After numerous experimentations, he was able to make his body a Chimera. He no longer had the weak body of a magician.</span></p><p><span style="">If both their summons were taken out of the picture, Rashmode held a large advantage over the Immmortal.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hoo hoo hoo. I&apos;ll finally be able to see you die.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I guess you are quite confident. Why don&apos;t we fight after you return Bibi?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Huh? Koo-hahaha.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Rashmode&apos;s face lit up. It felt as if he had seen a new and different side to the Immortal.</span></p><p><span style="">If someone found out that their arrogant idol was a simpleton, would they feel what he was feeling right now?</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;You&#x2019;re friends with your familiars? Koo-hahaha.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">After laughing for a long while, Rashmode suddenly ended his laughter. He raised the cat in his grasp forward.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;She is only a disposable item. Who cares what happens to her? She exists only to be dominated.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Rashmode tightened his grip and tore apart the cat, Bibi.</span></p><p><span style="">Puh-uhk!</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin&apos;s eyebrows twitched when he saw Rashmode pluck the cat&apos;s head off her body.</span></p><p><span style="">&lt;Succubus Bibi was killed. The Succubus&apos; level will decrease by 1.&gt;</span></p><p><span style="">&lt;Re-summon is impossible for 32 days.&gt;</span></p><p><span style="">Familiars can experience death, but they won&apos;t disappear. The familiar stayed dead for a time in correspondence to the familiar&apos;s level. Afterwards, the familiar once again appeared in the Summoning room.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Koo-haha. What? Are you perhaps going to get angry at me?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;No way.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin headed towards Rashmode with heavy eyes.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Do you think me getting angry could properly express my rage?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Kooh-haha. Impudent bastard.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">He didn&apos;t like this bastard.</span></p><p><span style="">When would he be able to change his confidence and arrogance turn into abject cowardice?</span></p><p><span style="">Rashmode wanted to see it happen today.</span></p><p><span style="">He dashed towards Woojin.</span></p><p><span style="">There wasn&apos;t a single body part on his body he hadn&apos;t Chimerified. His two legs that kicked off the ground was as strong and fast as a Centaur&apos;s kick. His two arms exceeded the gripping strength an ogre.</span></p><p><span style="">Hwa-roo-rook.</span></p><p><span style="">A glowing black sword appeared in Rashmode&apos;s hand. On top of his strengthened body, he still had the speciality black magic that he could use without limitation.</span></p><p><span style="">After being Initialized, he wasn&apos;t an opponent that a Necromancer barely over level 70 could handle.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Crawl underneath my feet!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Beg for your life. Struggle beneath me.</span></p><p><span style="">Crawl on the ground in obsequiousness.</span></p><p><span style="">Well, he wouldn&apos;t mind if the Necromancer died immediately.</span></p><p><span style="">Hwa-roo-rook!</span></p><p><span style="">Rahsmode swung his black sword with the intent of splitting him into two pieces.</span></p><p><span style="">Ggahng!</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin had taken out his Steel Staff, and he had blocked Rashmode&apos;s black sword.</span></p><p><span style="">Rashmode&apos;s eyebrows lifted.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ho-oh! Is it Necromancy?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The Immortal had used this technique occasionally.</span></p><p><span style="">In the past, he had showed battle capability that was almost inconceivable for a magician.</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin let out a cold laugh.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Not at all.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The Steel Staff changed into a Great Sword and Woojin attacked Rashmode with it.</span></p><p><span style="">Hooohng.</span></p><p><span style="">Rashmode had stepped out of the way to avoid the blow, but the weapon had already changed into a spear that was thrusted towards him.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;What a troublesome weapon.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">Was it an Epic Item? The free-changing form of the item was quite similar to a Warrior&apos;s Weapon.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;N...no way!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Rashmode was surprised at what he had considered to be a ridiculous notion.</span></p><p><span style="">Come to think of it, the Immortal was keeping up with his fortified body. Moreover, the Immortal had strength that matched his speed and reaction.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;You bastard! You became a Warrior?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin laughed instead of answering him.</span></p><p><span style="">&lt;The time remaining on Warrior&apos;s Wrath 77, 76, 75&#x2026;.&gt;</span></p><p><span style="">His extreme anger could be maintained much longer as his level increased. However, he was running out of time. Woojin swung his weapon, which had turned into an axe. Then he quickly changed it back into a great sword to execute a stab.</span></p><p><span style="">With his unconventional attack and strength, Rashmode was being pushed back more and more. He couldn&apos;t help but be taken aback.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;He threw away the Undead Army to become a common Warrior.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">He was having a hard time believing it, but the evidence was right in front of his eyes. As they exchanged a flurry of blows, Rashmode was gradually being undone. It was a fight between a Warrior, and a magician with fortified strength and quickness.</span></p><p><span style="">In a hand-to-hand fight like this, the Warrior would inevitably hold the advantage.</span></p><p><span style="">Poo-oohk!</span></p><p><span style="">When he saw the blade of the spear embed itself deep into his abdomen, Rashmode&apos;s pale expression hardened. He immediately leaped backwards and widened the distance between his enemy.</span></p><p><span style="">Poo-hwahk!</span></p><p><span style="">When the blade of the spear was extracted, a fountain of blood flew out of the hole in his abdomen, but the blood flow stopped after couple seconds. Then, the wound started to heal. He hadn&apos;t used healing magic. It was an effect of his Chimera body. He had a much better version of a Troll&apos;s regeneration ability.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Stupid bastard. You ran away to earth, then threw away your Necromancy to train in Warrior techniques?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;This is fun in its own way.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Stupid bastard.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">He acknowledged it. The potential of Woojin&apos;s combat ability was incredible. If he reached Max Level as a Warrior class, he would most definitely be stronger than any of the heroes in the alliance.</span></p><p><span style="">However, that would be it.</span></p><p><span style="">Rashmode consumed the Dungeon Energy to quickly regenerate the monsters.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Koo-roo-roo-roo.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">He relaxed a little bit as he saw the monsters appearing, one or two at a time in the air.</span></p><p><span style="">The Immortal had been problematic because of the Undead Army he controlled. The Undead Army had been able to contend with Trahnet&apos;s army.</span></p><p><span style="">However, he had given up that army so Rashmode didn&apos;t have to be afraid of it any more.</span></p><p><span style="">When Rashmode surrendered to Trahnet, he was given power.</span></p><p><span style="">The summoned monsters ran towards Woojin.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Koo-koo. Let&apos;s see how long you can last..&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The bastard will eventually tire out, and he will take credit for the victory. As befitting his position as commander, he&apos;ll just watch the bastard&apos;s tenacious resistance at his leisure. Then he&apos;ll enjoy his moment of victory.</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin used his various skills to fight the monsters. After the kill count exceeded a hundred, one could notice he was tiring. There were wounds all over his body, and he looked like a bloody mess.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Koo-hahaha. Naive bastard. This is the price of throwing away your power of control for a bloody sword. How does it feel?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Who...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin laughed as he was drenched in blood.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Who said I threw it away?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">He had only been using his Energy to attack. His Mana had been slowly replenishing and was almost ninety full. Woojin stretched out both of his arms.</span></p><p><span style="">Puh-puh-puh-puhk!</span></p><p><span style="">The corpses that were littered all about in his surrounding exploded. Then the Skeleton Soldiers and Magicians started to rise.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Kee-kee-kee-keek.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The underground cavern was filled with Skeletons, their voices terrifying.</span></p><p><span style="">When a friendly force was killed, it didn&apos;t end at -1. The dead ally was turned into an enemy, so the score would become a -2. This was why the Immortal had been troublesome to deal with. When several hundred skeletons looked back at him, Rashmode&apos;s face turned white.</span></p><p></p></div><p></p>
