<p>Chapter 174 - Air Strike (3)</p><p><span style="">- &#xA0;The Dungeon Break at Daejun station was caused by lack of communication between the army and the Roused General Affairs Bureau. &#xA0;The estimated casualties are....</span></p><p><span style="">The calm words of the anchor tickled his ears.</span></p><p><span style="">- The king of Alandal Kahng-woojin hasn&apos;t shown up yet, but the aircraft carrier he had purchased appeared from the sky. &#xA0;Dozens of Wyverns and Wyvern Riders were dispatched, and they subjugated the monsters near the Daejun station...</span></p><p><span style="">It was as if his neural circuits suddenly connected. &#xA0;His head started to clear, and he started remembering the past events.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Huhk!&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Minjae let out a moan as he opened his eyes. &#xA0;The thin blanket covering his lower body fell to the floor as he caught sight of his surrounding.</span></p><p><span style="">There were numerous beds lined up, and several people were lying within it. &#xA0;Minjae had been one of the people lying in one of the beds.</span></p><p><span style="">- The world is suffering from the unannounced Breaks. &#xA0;However, the manpower and materials needed to keep earth safe is being diverted to Alphen. &#xA0;There are negative public reactions regarding....</span></p><p><span style="">When he turned to look at the source of the sound, he found the sound was emanating from a tv mounted on the wall.</span></p><p><span style="">It was a news program. &#xA0;In the past, he always watched it for any news regarding the Dungeon Break.</span></p><p><span style="">The only thing different this time around was the fact that he had been at the site of the outbreak. &#xA0;Moreover, he had been an inch away from losing his life. &#xA0;He was probably at the hospital right now.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;You are all healed now.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;....&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">When Minjae turned his head around, he saw a little girl. &#xA0;She was tall enough to reach his waist.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Who...?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I&apos;m Sooah. &#xA0;Heh heh. &#xA0;I&apos;ll pray for you.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Sooah suddenly grabbed Minjae&apos;s hand as she shut her eyes. &#xA0;He was taken aback at her unexpected gesture.</span></p><p><span style="">However, his protestation lasted only a moment. &#xA0;He could feel a large energy transfer to him through their hands, and he could feel his heart calm down. &#xA0;He unconsciously closed his eyes.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Ha-ah. &#xA0;You are all good. &#xA0;You&apos;ll be able to go home in high spirits.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;T...thank you.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Minjae awkwardly scratched the back of his head, and he gave his thanks. &#xA0;Currently, he felt confident as if he could do anything he wanted.</span></p><p><span style="">&apos;Was it a Blessing?&apos;</span></p><p><span style="">Minjae had just developed his Barrier ability, so he could feel it. &#xA0;The girl had just used an ability called Blessing.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Uh? &#xA0;Minjae?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">The door opened, and Minjae&apos;s friends ran towards him with happy expressions on their faces. &#xA0;When they saw Sooah next to Minjae, they bowed towards her. &#xA0;They were careful in how they acted as if they had met a teacher in the hallway.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I&apos;ll see you next time, misters.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">When Sooah left as she waved her hand, Minjae&apos;s friends all bowed towards her.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Yes. &#xA0;Please take care.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Who&apos;s the kid?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;How dare you call her a kid!&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">His friends made a big fuss when they heard Minjae&apos;s question.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;She is the princess of Alandal.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Huh?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;She is Kahng-woojin-nim&apos;s dongsaeng.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;...mmm. &#xA0;Uh uh? &#xA0;What?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;She is Kahng-woojin-nim&apos;s sister.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Huhl.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Minaje was dumbfounded. &#xA0;He looked back and forth from his hand and the door where Sooah had exited.</span></p><p><span style="">He could still feel the warmth on his hand, and he felt a peaceful feeling that he had never felt before. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">He had never expected her to be Kahng-woojin&apos;s dongsaeng....</span></p><p><span style="">It felt as if he had just met a celebrity.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;When you fainted, I thought you were going to die. &#xA0;I was so surprised.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Anyways, where is this place?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">When the confused Minjae asked the question, his friends answered in restless voices.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;You don&apos;t know where this is? &#xA0;If I had brought my handphone, I would have taken a selfie.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Which hospital am I in?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;This isn&apos;t a hospital. &#xA0;It&apos;s Bibi&apos;s Castle.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;What?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Bibi&apos;s Castle! &#xA0;It&apos;s Alandal&apos;s aircraft carrier.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;....Huhl.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">He was having a hard time believing that his current situation was real. &#xA0;It seemed his friends felt the same way. &#xA0;No, it seemed they were restless as if they were excited by all of this.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Something big has happened to us.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">They felt like main characters inside a movie.</span></p><p><span style="">However, Minjae felt glum as he looked at his friends.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Yes. &#xA0;We did experience something big today.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;....&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">It took less than 1 second for his excited friends to have glum expressions.</span></p><p><span style="">- Doesn&apos;t earth need to be saved more than Alphen? &#xA0;This is the public opinion of the international community, and this question is being asked towards Alandal. &#xA0;Which place really needs the help of Alandal? &#xA0;Is it earth or Alphen?</span></p><p><span style="">The anchor&apos;s words dug into his ears.</span></p><p><span style="">He had almost died. &#xA0;He hadn&#x2019;t known the reality of situation when he watched the events through the news. &#xA0;The situation was completely different for him now, since he had experienced it firsthand.</span></p><p><span style="">It would be different if the attack hadn&apos;t been at Daejun. &#xA0;They would have continued to feel excited at what was going on around the world.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;A lot of people died....&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">When the gloomy words exited his friend&apos;s mouth, the worries he had suppressed started to rise up again. &#xA0;A lot of people had been killed, and the thought that it could have been his family hammered Minjae&apos;s heart..</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Let&apos;s go to our homes first.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;All right. &#xA0;How are we supposed to get there?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;We are at Seoul. &#xA0;We just landed not too long ago. &#xA0;We can ride the bus.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">While Minjae was unconscious, his friends had already toured the aircraft carrier until they were about to land.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;What about the transportation fee?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;.....&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">The three friends looked at each other&apos;s faces at the same time. &#xA0;They realized none of them had any money, so they lowered their heads.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;D...do you think they&apos;ll loan us some money?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I think the might. &#xA0;Right?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">They knew they were being shameless. &#xA0;The people of Alandal had saved them, but they wondered if they would be able to get some money to get home. &#xA0;Minjae and his friends exited the room.</span></p><p><span style="">***</span></p><p><span style="">He was in a PC room at Seogwipo-si of the Jejudo island.</span></p><p><span style="">Click, click!</span></p><p><span style="">The mouse was moving swiftly, and his fingers danced atop the keyboard.</span></p><p><span style="">&lt;5Piktap-nim is going into overdrive.&gt;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Hell yeah!&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Lee-sahngho lovingly looked at his character. &#xA0;It had just advanced in class.</span></p><p><span style="">How great would it be if reality was like a game?</span></p><p><span style="">The game was fair compared to the unfairness of reality. &#xA0;In a game, everyone started out the same, and the victor and the loser was determined by one&apos;s effort.</span></p><p><span style="">If the world was like a game, he would have been able to easily dispatch that fucker, Kahng-woojin.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I think I&apos;ve found one, president!&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Lee-sahngho was still in the middle of his game. &#xA0;He spoke without taking his eyes off his screen.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Who is it?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;It is a 70 year old man. &#xA0;His impotence was cured through the miracle of god.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;What&apos;s the source?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;It is a magazine...&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;What kind of magazine?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;It&apos;s a gossip magazine.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;....&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Lee-sahngho stopped moving his mouse with his hand. &#xA0;He turned his head to look at his underling.</span></p><p><span style="">No wonder his guild and company went under. &#xA0;Lee-sahngho had trusted men like him.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;You want a beating?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I&apos;ll go look once more.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Hoo-ooh.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Lee-sahngho took out a cigarette, and he lit it. &#xA0;He was about to focus on his game again.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I found one too, president.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;What&apos;s your source?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;It is an article from the Yonhap news.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">When Lee-sahngho asked for the source of the information, his employee answered confidently. He looked at the employee. Yes, this one was a little bit more clever than the others.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Give me a summary.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Didn&#x2019;t Alandal&apos;s aircraft carrier get deployed when the Daejun station Broke not too long ago? &#xA0;Three high school students got lucky, and they were allowed to board the aircraft carrier. &#xA0;They were healed and sent home. &#xA0;This is their interview.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">They had kept up their surveillance on Kahng-woojin and Alandal, but this wasn&apos;t the information Lee-sahngho wanted.</span></p><p><span style="">He needed to find a god or someone that could perform god-like miracles. &#xA0;</span><span style="">&quot;What about it?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;If you read the content of the interview....&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Ah. Fuck.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Lee-sahngho was annoyed with all of this. &#xA0;He safely left his game character in a safe region, and he turned to look at the computer monitor of his employee.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Where is it?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;It is over here.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">The employee scrolled down the article with the mouse wheel, and he highlighted a section.</span></p><p><span style="">- She grabbed my hand, and when she gave prayer, I felt my body heal. &#xA0;It was as if a cherubim was staring down....</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Mmmmm.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">There were a lot of Healers and Buffers amongst the Roused.</span></p><p><span style="">The healing ability could occur from borrowing power from a god. &#xA0;On the other hand, a Roused could also accelerate the natural healing process with their ability. &#xA0;There was no Roused from earth that could use the Holy Power.</span></p><p><span style="">There was the famous Holy Maiden Melody, who used the Holy Power. &#xA0;However, she was originally from Alphen.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Isn&apos;t this a little weak?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Holy Power was used within Alandal, but wasn&#x2019;t there a plausible explanation? &#xA0;He couldn&apos;t give a report to Iello with just this information.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Still, I think it is worth pursuing.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Well, you take care of it.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Yes, sir.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Lee-sahngho once again sat back in his chair, and he started playing his game again.</span></p><p><span style="">Several dozen of his employees were surfing the web trying to find information.</span></p><p><span style="">Iello&apos;s loyal retainer Lee-sahngho benefited from the information age. &#xA0;He was able to gather information in comfort.</span></p><p><span style="">***</span></p><p><span style="">Alandal&#x2019;s Territory near Seoul Station.</span></p><p><span style="">Bibi&apos;s castle was parked in the sky. &#xA0;It was a stark contrast with the view of the city.</span></p><p><span style="">Of course, everyone in the city gathered to see Bibi&apos;s castle. &#xA0;It was if they were visiting a museum.</span></p><p><span style="">Alandal were in the midst of moving.</span></p><p><span style="">At the request of the reporters, Prime Minister Jung-minchan was giving a press conference.</span></p><p><span style="">Even if they declined all interviews like a proud peacock, it wasn&apos;t as if any country or media could do anything to Alandal. &#xA0;However, the international opinion of Alandal was declining right now.</span></p><p><span style="">Everyone was frightened from the unannounced Dungeon Breaks.</span></p><p><span style="">A calamity could appear at any time, but people felt that it could be prevented through preparation. &#xA0;When everyone thought about what this preparation entailed, they thought about Alandal.</span></p><p><span style="">To be precise, they thought about Alandal&apos;s Kahng-woojin.</span></p><p><span style="">He had shown up at every unexpected event. &#xA0;He had blocked and solved every issue. &#xA0;However, he was gone now, and it caused the world to become nervous. &#xA0;This was especially true for Koreans.</span></p><p><span style="">They had always thought, &apos;Kahng-woojin is living next to us. &#xA0;He&apos;ll block everything for us.&apos; &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">This thought changed to, &apos;I&apos;m about to die, so what the hell is he doing?&apos;</span></p><p><span style="">If Minchan reported the general sentiment of the public to Kahng-woojin, the answer that would come back was obvious. &#xA0;This was why Minchan had stepped forward to solve this issue. &#xA0;He was smooth with his speech, and he was able to strike the right tone with his words. &#xA0;It was his duty to fix these kinds of problems. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Can&apos;t he reschedule the expedition to Alphen? &#xA0;Can&apos;t it be at a later date?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;He must do this. &#xA0;It is for the safety of earth. &#xA0;There is a solution that will allow us to escape the Dungeons. &#xA0;The king is looking for this solution.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">After he gave a sufficient answer, he moved onto the next reporter. &#xA0;When a reporter raised his hand, Minchan pointed at him.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Some in the public claim that Alandal is moving to Alphen.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;That is ridiculous.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Didn&apos;t Alandal complete Kahng-woojin&apos;s Ark?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;....&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Alandal&apos;s Prime Minister glared at the reporter, who had asked the question.</span></p><p><span style="">Kahng-woojinn&apos;s Ark.</span></p><p><span style="">The comparison to Noah&apos;s Ark was getting more prevalent..</span></p><p><span style="">People were referring to the Colony City that was placed on the aircraft carrier. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">They were talking about Bibi&apos;s Castle.</span></p><p><span style="">The people of earth didn&apos;t know when they&apos;ll die, so they might be viewing Bibi&apos;s Castle as a lifeline that&apos;ll allow them to avoid this disaster.</span></p><p><span style="">There were countless articles that were written about the elites of the country that were promising Alandal enormous sums of money. &#xA0;They hoped to get on the Bibi&apos;s Castle. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">Jung-minchan was very wary when such topics came up. &#xA0;He was most defensive when those accusations came up.</span></p><p><span style="">&apos;If they knew how hard our king is working, they would never say such things....&apos;</span></p><p><span style="">Kahng-woojin wanted to protect earth more than anyone else. &#xA0;In truth, Jung-minchan wasn&apos;t afraid of their situation deteriorating in the international community. &#xA0;He was afraid that Kahng-woojin might become disappointed in the people of earth.</span></p><p><span style="">He was afraid Kahng-woojin would abandon earth from disappointment when he saw the selfishness of the people on earth.</span></p><p><span style="">If one ignored the double standard, the king of Alandal didn&apos;t have any reason to save earth.</span></p><p><span style="">He was a Dimensional lord. &#xA0;If he wanted to, he could just save his family and the guild members of Alandal.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;This is a tactical fortress. &#xA0;I feel uncomfortable calling it an Ark. &#xA0;Next question.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">As if he had been waiting for it, a reporter quickly raised his hand.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;You just called it a tactical fortress. &#xA0;Are you planning on roaming around the entire length of Korea to quell the monsters?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Minchan let out a small smile.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Of course. &#xA0;We&apos;ll go where the help is needed. &#xA0;We&apos;ll subjugate the monsters. &#xA0;I&apos;m not talking only about Korea. &#xA0;We&apos;ll help the world.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Isn&apos;t that a little bit of dangerous statement to say? &#xA0;We know Alandal&apos;s facilities are being emptied right now. &#xA0;We know that all of Alandal is moving into the Bibi&apos;s Castle. &#xA0;Are you planning on throwing away Korea?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;We aren&#x2019;t throwing anyone away. &#xA0;We are trying to protect earth.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Aren&apos;t you all Koreans?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;We are earthians.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;....&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">As he looked at the reporter, who had asked the question, Minchan spoke in a tone of assurance.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Korea has to withdraw its mentality of leaning on Alandal. &#xA0;A nation should protect itself. &#xA0;We are just helpers.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Weren&apos;t they looking down on their nation&apos;s self-defense capabilities? &#xA0;Or are they throwing a tantrum out of desperation?</span></p><p><span style="">&apos;I might have done something unnecessary.&apos;</span></p><p><span style="">Minchan had been frustrated, so he hadn&apos;t thought over what he was going to say. &#xA0;He regretted his word.</span></p><p><span style="">He didn&apos;t know about the international politics, but at the very least, the people of Korea might not look favorably at Alandal. </span></p><p><span style="">&apos;I&apos;m worried about the articles that&apos;ll come out tomorrow.&apos;</span></p><p><span style="">The pens were moving furiously over notebooks and notepads owned the the reporters. &#xA0;It felt as if the sounds of the pens were stabbing at his heart.</span></p>
