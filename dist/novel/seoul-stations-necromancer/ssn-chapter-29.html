Thank you~)</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;This is quite unexpected?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin frowned as he saw the figures of about 20 monsters.</span></p><p>&lt;Lv 41 Orc Warrior&gt;</p><p>&lt;Lv 45 Orc Shaman&gt;</p><p><span style="">He would have never dreamed orcs would show up here. Their level was visible through the Warrior&#x2019;s Sense, and it was fairly high. He had to assume their actual fighting power was much higher. These bastards were analogous to humans. When the monsters of this race gather in a group, they were able to work synergistically.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Rakur Ri Maktoo, Ri Keo Alphen.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Sunggoo was surprised when bizarre words started to flow out from Woojin&#x2019;s mouth.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hy&#x2026;hyung-nim?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Sungoo wasn&#x2019;t the only one who was surprised. The orcs were surprised, and they started to murmur to each other.</span></p><p><span style="">[How can a human from earth speak the language of the orcs?]</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin made a bitter laugh. Orc were of a similar race. They were one of the tribes that made up Alphen&#x2019;s society. Woojin wondered how these orcs came to be in this Dungeon.</span></p><p><span style="">Weren&#x2019;t the Dungeons a route being used by Trahnet to invade Earth?</span></p><p><span style="">[Why are the Alphen&#x2019;s orcs here on earth?]</span></p><p><span style="">When Woojin replied in a similar words to their question, a large orc stepped forward.</span></p><p><span style="">[Who are you? How come a human from earth knows the Alphen&#x2019;s orc language?]</span></p><p><span style="">[That&#x2019;s not important. I&#x2019;m asking why you are in this place.]</span></p><p><span style="">[We lost our base.]</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin was surprised at the orc&#x2019;s words.</span></p><p><span style="">[Does that mean Alphen was taken by Trahnet?]</span></p><p><span style="">The orc turned silent at Woojin&#x2019;s words. How could the human from earth know so much about the matters regarding Alphen?</span></p><p><span style="">[That&#x2019;s right. One piece of the counter weight disappeared, and Trahnet became the owner of everything. We are able to exist here after we made a contract with Trahnet.]</span></p><p><span style="">[Contract?]</span></p><p><span style="">[Earth will become our new base..]</span></p><p><span style="">The invasion of Earth.</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin frowned. It was a bullshit contract. Earth didn&#x2019;t belong to Trahnet in the first place.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Do they want to die? How dare they come here?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">When Woojin spoke in Korean, Sunggoo asked with a dumbfounded expression on his face.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hyung-nim. Are you ok?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I thought hyung-nim was speaking in tongues.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Sunggoo had genuinely been worried. Woojin had suddenly let out guttural sounds. Sunggoo&#x2019;s concern seeped with loyalty, and it awakened Woojin&#x2019;s senses.</span></p><p>&lt;Warrior&#x2019;s Rage has been activated.&gt;</p><p>&lt;Variable Stats has been elevated. Duration time 29, 28 &#x2026;.&gt;</p><p><span style="">Whew. So this is what Rage is. Woojin bottled up his anger then he looked at the orcs. He had to direct his anger towards the orcs instead of Sunggoo. After they lost their homeland, they had crawled into someone else&#x2019;s land. Moreover, they were trying to take it away.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I&#x2019;m not afraid of a team battle.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">If it was a team battle, he was confident he wouldn&#x2019;t lose.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Bombard them.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">At Woojin&#x2019;s words, the Skeleton Magicians on standby started to bombard the orcs with each of their own magic.</span></p><p><span style="">Shooooooo, Puh-puh-puhng!</span></p><p><span style="">The fire, ice and electricity magic flew like raining arrows toward the orc&#x2019;s position, and it scorched the earth. After a moment of disturbance, the cloud of dust subsided, and Sunggoo had a shocked expression at what he saw.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Those&#x2026;those bastards are unscathed?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The orc shaman had used a barrier magic to protect themselves. Woojin grinned.</span></p><p><span style="">Whether it was the orcs or whatever else, he wouldn&#x2019;t allow them to take earth while he was here.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Let&#x2019;s see if they could hold out against this.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">If his magic wasn&#x2019;t working, then he just had to increase their power.</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin opened the Skill Window, and he immediately raised the level of Skeleton Magicians to 10.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Kee-kee-keek.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The appearance of the Skeleton Magicians started to change. A black air current started to form around their emaciated bodies, and it materialized into a black robe. If they stood still, one could mistake them for people with hood over their head.</span></p><p><span style="">The hands made out of the emaciated bones thrust out from between the robes. Then a light two times the size of the previous one formed to make magic.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Shoot them.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">At Woojin&#x2019;s command, magic that couldn&#x2019;t&#x2019; even compared to the ones before started to rain down on the orcs.</span></p><p><span style="">Hwa-roo-rook, Puhng! Zzuh-zuh-zuhng, pah-jee-jeek!</span></p><p><span style="">When the fire ball made contact, it exploded. The ice froze its surrounding. The strengthened electric shock was the most effective against the orcs, since the orcs used tempered iron as weapons.</span></p><p><span style="">[Brave warriors! Charge!]</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Beat them before they charge.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Shoo-shoo-shoo-shook.</span></p><p><span style="">At Woojin&#x2019;s command, the Skeleton Magicians let out consecutive magic spells. When their level increased, the range, shooting rate and power of the magic had increased.</span></p><p><span style="">The orcs had been a good distance away. While they were charging towards Woojin, over half of them had died. When the orcs closed the distance, Woojin immediately canceled the summons for the 40 Skeleton Magicians.</span></p><p><span style="">Wa-rooroo.</span></p><p><span style="">Their body broke down, and a pile of bones was created. Woojin grinned.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Let&#x2019;s change 2nd round into a different event.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">He used the bones as medium to summon the Skeleton Soldiers.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Kee-keee-keek!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">His 40 points of magic would all be used up, but he didn&#x2019;t care. He had other methods he could use. He wasn&#x2019;t only about the magic.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Well, let&#x2019;s go.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Kekeke.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin lifted his steel staff, and he charged. The Skeleton Soldiers quickly moved behind him. The orc&#x2019;s attacks were very strong. The Skeleton Soldiers were weak in endurance, so their skulls were broken after couple blows. However, Woojin didn&#x2019;t care.</span></p><p><span style="">Every time the orc brought down a Skeleton Soldier, it got injured. The next Skeleton Soldier would also wound the orc again as it fell. The orc couldn&#x2019;t face a Skeleton Soldier for the third time. It was killed after being pierced by a Skeleton Soldier&#x2019;s sword.</span></p><p><span style="">No matter how brave the orc warriors were they couldn&#x2019;t stand up against superior numbers. Woojin killed the last remaining orc. He crushed the orc shaman&#x2019;s skull then he let out a sigh.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Maybe humans might show up in Dungeons soon.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hyung-nim. You are even good at telling jokes.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">After the battle ended, Sunggoo was in a familiar territory. He quickly looted the items used by the orcs.</span></p><p><span style="">*</span></p><p><span style="">*In front of Gwachun City Hall Station&#x2019;s 11th exit*</span></p><p><span style="">Kim-haemin scratched his cheeks.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Team leader. Isn&#x2019;t this getting pretty serious?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;How long has it been?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;It&#x2019;s been 6 hrs and 20 min.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">At Haemin&#x2019;s words, Michan&#x2019;s expression also turned serious. The normal clear time for a 4 star Dungeon was 4 hrs. That meant 20 hrs had passed within the Dungeon.</span></p><p><span style="">The two of them had already spent 25 hrs 20 min inside the Dungeon.</span></p><p><span style="">This meant they had survived for over a day within the Dungeon&#x2026;.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Uh, uh, Team leader. The barrier.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Jung-michan gulped as he saw the barrier disintegrate.</span></p><p><span style="">Come out. Please come out alive.</span></p><p><span style="">He yelled those words inside, but he didn&#x2019;t see any changes at the bottom of the stairs.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ah&#x2026;.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">When he let out a small sigh, he heard the sound of footsteps on the stairs.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ah. Maybe I should take a cart next time.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin and Sunggoo complained as they carried up the leather armors and weapons worn by the orcs. They were bring up a lot of stuff.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;C&#x2026;congratulation on your safe return.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Minchan ran down the stairs, and he was emotional as he grabbed Woojin. Woojin stared back at him with a blank face.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Why are you making such a fuss?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ah. Just Go down and bring those stuff up.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ah&#x2026;.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin and Suggoo had gathered a massive amount of loot. They had 2 full bags of bloodstones, and the size of the bloodstones couldn&#x2019;t even be compared to the ones in the lower Dungeons.</span></p><p><span style="">Moreover, the equipment worn by the orcs were quite valuable. They also brought iron weapons, animal leathers, and rough cloths. It was items that could be purchased on earth. However, these were valuable since it could pass through the portals.</span></p><p><span style="">Any Roused could enter the low ranked Dungeons. It was possible for them to take modern items. Those Dungeons were basically neutral territories.</span></p><p><span style="">However, the higher ranked Dungeons only allowed the Roused to come across the portal. Modern items were useless.</span></p><p><span style="">When Woojin returned to the other side of the portal after obtaining the Return Stone, his clothes, hand-phone and bloodstone bags were strewn all over the floor.</span></p><p><span style="">They had to bring those items out too with the loot.</span></p><p><span style="">With the help of Minchan, Woojin and Sunggoo were sorting the loot.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;You are saying I could exchange the bloodstones at the exchange store, but it is up to us to sell the other items?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes. That&#x2019;s correct. Wait a moment&#x2026;&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Minchan opened the sportsbag, and he took out a scanner. He brought it over the items as if he was scanning it.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Mmmm. They are all normal items. There are no artifacts. However, these items came out the Dungeon, so they should be quite valuable..&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;So where do I go to sell this?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Usually the support division of the guilds takes care of it&#x2026;.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Michan stopped speaking, and he looked at Woojin to see how he responded. Would it be okay for him to talk about it?</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Well, if you enter a guild, then the support division will take care of these minor tasks&#x2026;..&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;It does sound convenient.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Why don&#x2019;t you enter into our guild? I promise we will give you the best treatment.&#x201D;&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ah, that&#x2019;s all right. Why don&#x2019;t uncle&#x2019;s guild buy some of this stuff. It&#x2019;ll be inconvenient for me to carry these around.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;&#x2026;.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Michan bought all the loot Woojin had brought. He also gave a good price on it.</span></p><p><span style="">$110,000.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;The profit here isn&#x2019;t that great.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I guess so. However, wasn&#x2019;t it a bit easier than before?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Sunggoo knew what Woojin was getting at. At the Rakwi spawn site, he was busy extracting the bloodstones, so this was a bit easier for Sunggoo. Woojin also never felt he was in danger at that place. However, if he thought about the profit in terms of how much they made per hour, the 3 star Dungeons was a better option.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;&#x2026;.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The gears inside Jung-minchan&#x2019;s mind started to spin quickly. By loooking at Woojin and Suggoo&#x2019;s reaction, it seemed they had never really been in danger inside this Dungeon.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Maybe he is Rank A.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">Minchan felt his heart pound . If it was possible, he wanted to accompany Woojin into the Dungeon. He wanted to see with his own eyes as to how he attacked the Dungeon.</span></p><p><span style="">This particular Roused had only attacked the Dungeons on three occasions yet he shook Minchan&#x2019;s heart. This was the first time he had felt this way.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Please give me your phone number.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;No.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Please give it to me.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;You are going to bother me if I do.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;&#x2026;.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Of course.</span></p><p><span style="">Minchan wasn&#x2019;t going to lose the Roused he had an eye on. However, Woojin was a tough cookie. He had given a lot of help to Woojin and Sunggoo even though they weren&#x2019;t members of his guild. However, he didn&#x2019;t want to lord it over them.</span></p><p><span style="">It seemed Woojin didn&#x2019;t feel thankful towards him. It felt like his treatment of Woojin was considered as matter of course.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Let&#x2019;s coincidentally meet again next time.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;&#x2026;.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">When the money was deposited, Woojin brushed himself off, and he stood up. Minchan didn&#x2019;t have any reason he could use to stop him.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I&#x2019;ll see you out.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ah, it&#x2019;s all right.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Haha. I insist. Let&#x2019;s go.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Hamein followed after the two, and he saw them off from the parking lot. Minchan felt dejected as he sat down. Soon, Haemin hurriedly came running back.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Team leader! I got it.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What did you get?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;His phone number.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Mincha&#x2019;s eyes turned round, and he looked at the phone number in Haemin&#x2019;s grasp.</span></p><p><span style="">[Kang-woojin 010-12xx-xxxx]</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Are you sure this isn&#x2019;t a fake number?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;No. I called it up.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Huh. If he was going to give it away so easily then why did he play so hard to get?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I&#x2026;I&#x2019;m not sure.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Minchan frowned. He couldn&#x2019;t make heads or tails of this situation. Previously, he acted like he would reject joining the guild yet his action right now left some room for doubt. It seems he isn&#x2019;t entirely opposed to joining the guild.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Is he some kind of an expert at negotiations?&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">Michan thought Woojin was a 24 year old young man, who was short on experience in society. He had to revise this opinion. After thinking for a long time, Minchan suddenly asked a question.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What did you say that convinced him to give you his number?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I just said I wanted to have some soju with him next time?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;&#x2026;.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Ha. He had no idea what was going on inside of Wooijn.</span></p><p></p></div><p></p>
