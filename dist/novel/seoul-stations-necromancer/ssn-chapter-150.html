<p><span style="">Chapter 150 - Planet Jaku (2)</span></p><p><span style=""> Woojin stood in front of the building that was the center of the Colony.</span></p><p><span style="">It was a tower made out of steel, and a green light was surging forth from the top of the tower.</span></p><p><span style="">&lt;You&apos;ve cleared an ownerless Colony.&gt; </span></p><p><span style="">&lt;You have the choice of Destruction or Occuptation.&gt; </span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Occupation?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Was this choice given to him because the Dimensional lord was dead right now? &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">For a brief moment, Woojin thought over the additional option he was given.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Master! Give this to me. Please give me this castle.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Bibi stamped her feet, but Woojin came to a decision.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;It&apos;ll be meaningless.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Peee.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">What was his goal?</span></p><p><span style="">Was he like the other Dimensional lords, who were focused in raising their rankings?</span></p><p><span style="">The Colony and the numerous Dungeon buildings were important in gaining the currency called Energy. Energy was important in determining the ranking, and he would be able to plunder this place endlessly....</span></p><p><span style="">However, his goal wasn&apos;t to conquer other planets.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I&apos;m going to destroy it.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Woojin chose the Destruction option.</span></p><p><span style="">Koo-roo-roo-roo, kwah-ah-ahng! </span></p><p><span style="">The steel tower fell over, and it exploded.</span></p><p><span style="">Additional explosions occurred as the entire city was destroyed.</span></p><p><span style="">&lt;You&apos;ve gained a Dimensional Fragment.&gt; </span></p><p><span style="">&lt;You&apos;ve gained 50 thousand point through Destruction Compensation. &#xA0;&gt; </span></p><p><span style="">&lt;You&apos;ve looted the Dimensional lord &apos;Liah&apos;s Storage&apos;.&gt; </span></p><p><span style="">&lt;You&apos;ve gained a necklace called Rahim&apos;s Curse.&gt; </span></p><p><span style="">&lt;The bulky and long....&gt; </span></p><p><span style="">&lt;&#x2026;&#x2026;.&gt; </span></p><p><span style="">The randomly looted items were automatically deposited into Woojin&apos;s Inventory. &#xA0;Woojin shook his head when he saw the enormous quantity of Items.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;That is a lot of stuff.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">While one was dead, the system was set up where one could be taken to the cleaners.</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin now understood what Liah had been trying to say.</span></p><p><span style="">She had said one couldn&apos;t raise one&apos;s ranking through Duel. It had to be done through Dimensional battles.</span></p><p><span style="">The risk of dying in a Duel was too high. &#xA0;The Dimensional battles was the more prudent option.</span></p><p><span style="">If one didn&apos;t have a decent strategist, one would have to give up entirely on the Dimensional battles like Liah. &#xA0;Or else one had to go all in on increasing one&apos;s skill at Dimensional Battle.</span></p><p><span style="">It was best to gather Energy while minimizing one&apos;s risk. &#xA0;Moreover, if one allowed the Domain Residents access to hunting grounds through Dungeons, one would make a pretty good amount just from collecting taxes.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I just have to stay alive.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Woojin smirked. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">Maybe the simple act of not dying would lead to a much bigger gain.</span></p><p><span style="">If one fought while worrying about death, one was already fighting a losing war. He had no choice, but to win. &#xA0;He&apos;ll clear all the Colonies and Dungeons. He&apos;ll seal the link from the source.</span></p><p><span style="">If Woojin couldn&apos;t do it himself, he would form a coalition on earth to bolster his force.</span></p><p><span style="">There will be a time when others would have to do their part to share in the burden.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I wonder if he is doing well?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">More time might be needed for Jaemin and his party to gel.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I wonder if Jaemin will get along with them.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Woojin was slightly worried about Jaemin&apos;s sneakily timid nature. &#xA0;In the end, Jaemin had to overcome his timidity on his own.</span></p><p><span style="">*** </span></p><p><span style="">Koo-koo-koong. </span></p><p><span style="">Baek-jungdo&apos;s fist finally crushed the ogre&apos;s head. &#xA0;When it fell, everyone turned to look at Jaemin.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;&#x2026;.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hurry up and drink from it. &#xA0;Then we can move on.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">At Chae-haesol&apos;s words, Jaemin put on a tearful face. &#xA0;In the end, he approached the ogre, and he bit into its throat.</span></p><p><span style="">Gulp, gulp.</span></p><p><span style="">Unlike the repulsion he felt, the blood tasted sweet. &#xA0;It couldn&apos;t be compared to a human&apos;s blood, but he still felt a good amount of pleasure. </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Oooohhhh.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">He felt an uncontrollable power surge up within him. &#xA0;He felt the power of an ogre. &#xA0;Jaemin&apos;s body shook before his body calmed down.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ha-ah. &#xA0;I&apos;ve had my fill.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Let&apos;s go. &#xA0;Let&apos;s head over there.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">A considerable number of monsters were already following Haesol around. &#xA0;There were flying type beasts like the small bird that could see far, and they alerted her of any danger. &#xA0;Then there were the predatory animals like wolves that could be used to track down her enemies.</span></p><p><span style="">However, her true ability was displayed when a battle suddenly started.</span></p><p><span style="">Kwahhh! </span></p><p><span style="">A mole type monster suddenly surged out of the ground, and Haesol used her Telepathic ability.</span></p><p><span style="">This was the result &#xA0;in progressing in her ability.</span></p><p><span style="">[Thought Sharing.] </span></p><p><span style="">Haesol didn&#x2019;t have to bother with consulting back and forth with her party members with words. &#xA0;Her ability allowed the party to share their thoughts in real time. &#xA0;Any plan she came up with was shared with the party members.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hoo-ahp!&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Baek-jungdo struck a mole with his fist. Blanka took out a staff he used for self defense, and he casted a Speed and Strength Buff on everyone.</span></p><p><span style="">The mole&apos;s sharp claws shot towards Jaemin. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">Jaemin bit into its arm.</span></p><p><span style="">Gulp, gulp. </span></p><p><span style="">Kyahk, kyahk! </span></p><p><span style="">When he started to drink its blood, the mole struggled as it swung its limbs. The struggle created wounds on Jaemin, but the wounds quickly closed from the effect of drinking the mole&apos;s blood.</span></p><p><span style="">The struggling monster&apos;s movement slowed, and in the end, it shriveled up as it died. Blood was dripping from his mouth as Jaemin dropped the mole. </span></p><p><span style="">Jaemin&#x2019;s body shook.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ooh ooh ooh.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">He could feel it. </span></p><p><span style="">He felt the power of the mole&#x2019;s strong hands! </span></p><p><span style="">His fingers moved in the air as if he was playing a piano, and &#xA0;the sounds of joints cracking was heard.</span></p><p><span style="">Haesol&#x2019;s Telepathic ability allower her to project her thoughts.</span></p><p><span style="">[Jaemin should take the front.] </span></p><p><span style="">This was like a simulation where everyone&#x2019;s role was clear.</span></p><p><span style="">It would be great if everyone carried out their role, but...</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Koo-ooh-ooh.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Jaemin&#x2019;s eye turned red, and Jaemin ran forward to slaughter the monsters.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ha. &#xA0;He is going berserk again.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Haesol shook her head from side to side as she gathered the party members.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Let&apos;s hurry up and catch up to him.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Let&#x2019;s do this.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">It seemed Jaemin earned power and saveragery when he drank the blood of the monsters. Once in a while, he would act out while being drunk on the blood. &#xA0;The number of monsters in front of them had increased suddenly, so it would be dangerous to leave Jaemin alone.</span></p><p><span style="">Do-jaemin wasn&apos;t Kahng-woojin.</span></p><p><span style="">The party quickly ran forward to give assistance to Jaemin.</span></p><p><span style="">Jaemin was in the midst of his berserk state. The party worked in concert with him, and their surrounding was filled with the corpses of monsters. </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hoo-ooh. &#xA0;Aren&#x2019;t there too many of them now?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;We are in trouble. Look toward the front!&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">At Blanka&apos;s words, Che-haesol looked around her surrounding. &#xA0;She shared in the hawk&apos;s vision....</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Oh no.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">A green pillar of light was rising up into the sky. &#xA0;It indicated where a Dimensional lord&apos;s Colony was located at. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">The number and variety of monsters were increasing, &#xA0;and it seemed they had traveled closer to the location of a colony.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I think it&apos;ll be too dangerous for us to get any closer.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Melody gave a stern warning, but Blanka shook his head from side to side.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;We are too late. &#xA0;Look over there.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">His finger was pointing at a large flock of airborne monsters flying towards them.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Shouldn&apos;t we call the president?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;We should call him even though he is in that state? &#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Baek-jungdo pointed at Jaemin, who was still in his berserk state.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Koo-roo-ooh-ooh-ooh.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Jaemin&#x2019;s eyes had turned red, and he wasn&#x2019;t showing any signs of recovering his right sanity. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">Haesol made a decision as she looked at the large flock of airborne monsters.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Let&#x2019;s bounce for now.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I think that would be wise.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Baek-jungdo grabbed Jaemin.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Koo-ahk, koohk!&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Jaemin instinctively pit down on Baek-jungdo&#x2019;s forearm, and his fangs broke.</span></p><p><span style="">Baek-jungdo&#x2019;s arms had turned black, and his skin wasn&#x2019;t weak enough to allow the fangs of an undeveloped vampire to pierce it.</span></p><p><span style="">Baek-jungdo was an extreme physical Roused.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Let&#x2019;s hide first. Then we can lure the monsters from near the Colony in small numbers, and we can get rid of them.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;All right..&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">The party moved faster after they came up with a plan of action.</span></p><p><span style="">*** </span></p><p><span style="">He was dying. </span></p><p><span style="">He was really going to die with the way things are going.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hoo-ooh.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Sunggoo focused all his senses to track the Lich&apos;s staff.</span></p><p><span style="">[Does this mean lashing on an idiot like you is useless ?] </span></p><p><span style="">Hwah-roo-roohk, kwahng! </span></p><p><span style="">Sunggoo gritted his teeth as he avoided the flame attack. </span></p><p><span style="">No one in their right mind would think such a large fireball was equivalent to a lashing. &#xA0;If he got hit by it, he would burn to death.</span></p><p><span style="">[How long are you going to run away like a coward?] </span></p><p><span style="">Hwah-roohk, kwah-kwahng. &#xA0;Kwahng! </span></p><p><span style="">The Lich&#x2019;s attack wasn&#x2019;t like consecutive rockets exploding. &#xA0;It was more like an endless stream of firing coming out a flamethrower. &#xA0;It didn&#x2019;t matter if he was far or close. &#xA0;The flame kept coming towards Sunggoo, and the Lich didn&#x2019;t give him any time to rest.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;What am I suppose to learn from this?&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">He was told the Lich would make him into a top Flame Magician, yet it just seemed like the Lich was impatient to kill him. Sunggoo took stock of his surrounding as he rolled on the ground, and he picked up a wooden branch.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hooooooooh.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">He detonated the magical energy within his body to create fire. &#xA0;Sunggoo charged towards the Lich, while holding a sword made out of flame. </span></p><p><span style="">[Goo-ha-ha. &#xA0;Do you finally feel like attacking me now?] </span></p><p><span style="">The tree branch had turned into a Flame Sword, and Sunggoo swung at the fireball that was flying towards him.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Chaaaaah!&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Hwah-roo-roohk. </span></p><p><span style="">Sunggoo ran forward as he cut apart the flame. &#xA0;The Lich was right in front of his eyes. &#xA0;This was the first time he had gotten this close to it.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Die!&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Sunggoo used all the enmity he felt to fuel his sword swing, but the Lich just reached out its hand to stop the blow. &#xA0;Its bony hands grabbed the tree branch.</span></p><p><span style="">It was as if the Lich didn&#x2019;t feel the heat as it didn&#x2019;t even move an inch from the attack. &#xA0;The flame around the Flame Sword was sucked into the Lich.</span></p><p><span style="">[Your fire can&apos;t distinguish between allies and enemies.] </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;&#x2026;?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">The words were too unexpected, so Sunggoo dropped his guard for a moment. &#xA0;This was when an explosion occurred.</span></p><p><span style="">Ggwahhhhng! </span></p><p><span style="">He was surrounded by flames as he was sent flying into the air.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ooh ooh.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">He felt a sense of vertigo as he lost consciousness for a brief moment. He was in a daze when he recovered his senses. &#xA0;His body was plummeting to the ground.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Dead&#x2026;.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">He would die if he proceeded to fall like this. &#xA0;He desperately flapped his arms and leg, but he couldn&apos;t fly.</span></p><p><span style="">Puh-uh-uhk! </span></p><p><span style="">Sunggoo was jammed into the ground. His eyes bugged out as he felt an incredible amount of pain.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Shit!&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">The incredible pain &#xA0;awakened his other sluggish senses. It felt as if he was about to die, but he wasn&apos;t dead yet. &#xA0;Sunggoo&apos;s body had been in a freefall for about 10 meters. &#xA0;However, his body had become strong and sturdy. &#xA0;His body was able to take that damage.</span></p><p><span style="">It was the result of him consistently taking Reinforcement Stones that increased his Strength, Agility and Stamina.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hoo-ooh.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">He didn&apos;t have the strength to twitch a finger, but he was at peace. He had given it all, yet it hadn&apos;t been enough. &#xA0;It seemed this would be the end of today&apos;s training session. </span></p><p><span style="">Sunggoo looked towards the sky. &#xA0;An enormous storm of fire was falling towards him.</span></p><p><span style="">[Did you give up? Do you dare give up your life on a battlefield?] </span></p><p><span style="">Hwah-roo-roohk. </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Shit!&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Crazy. &#xA0;This Lich had lost its mind. &#xA0;It was really trying to kill him.</span></p><p><span style="">This was all absurd, and he felt a sense of urgency. This sense of urgency allowed him to move his body.</span></p><p><span style="">A handful of magical energy responded to him, and he sucked in the flames from his surrounding.</span></p><p><span style="">Hoo-ooohng. </span></p><p><span style="">From the outside, it looked as if the flames surrounding Sunggoo was burning up his body, but the opposite was occurring.</span></p><p><span style="">Sunggoo was using Flame Absorption.</span></p><p><span style="">The magical energy that had bottomed out was recovering. &#xA0;It revitalized his body.</span></p><p><span style="">He quickly stood up, but the Fire Storm was too close to avoid it.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Will I be able to do it?&#x2019; &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">He thought about the method used by the Lich when it absorbed the his Flame Sword.</span></p><p><span style="">The Flame magic was a phenomena that occurred when magical energy was burned.</span></p><p><span style="">The magical energy possessed by Sunggoo was different from the magical energy possessed by the Lich. </span></p><p><span style="">Even if both of them were using fire, the character of the fire was different. &#xA0;It would be extremely difficult for him to use the Lich&apos;s flame. &#xA0;It would be impossible unless one had an incredible amount of control over one&apos;s magical energy. </span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Shit.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">It wouldn&apos;t benefit him to think about the probability of his success.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ooh-ah-ah-ah.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Sunggoo spread both his arms.</span></p><p><span style="">He didn&apos;t resist against the flames as he accepted it. </span></p><p><span style="">His two hands were getting hot, and he was trying very hard to feel the magic.</span></p><p><span style="">Hwah-roo-roo-roohk. </span></p><p><span style="">The fire looked as if it was about burn Sunggoo&apos;s hands. &#xA0;However, it was being rapidly sucked into his hands.</span></p><p><span style="">[Goo-ha-ha. &#xA0;You were barely able to learn the basics.] </span></p><p><span style="">The energy from the flame filled Sunggoo&#x2019;s body, and his body didn&#x2019;t know what to do with it. &#xA0;He felt his chest being overwhelmed by the surge of energy.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;This is Jaenis&apos; magical energy.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">He had absorbed the magic that had been detonated and sent out as a flame. &#xA0;Jaenis&#x2019; magical energy was bucking like a caged wild beast.</span></p><p><span style="">His life had been threatened, but he had learned something valuable.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Thank&#x2026;.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Hwah-roo-roohk. </span></p><p><span style="">He was about to give his thanks, yet a smaller flame was sent towards Sunggoo. &#xA0;It was smaller in size, but it held an explosive power.</span></p><p><span style="">Kwah-ah-ah-ahng! </span></p><p><span style="">[When did I say it was the end?] </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Shit!&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Sunggoo&apos;s hair was singed from the flame. &#xA0;He gritted his teeth. </span></p><p><span style="">In the end, the Lich was trying to push him until his died! </span></p><p><span style="">Sunggoo was filled with fighting spirit as he prepared for a proper fight. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">However, Woojin stood in his way.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Let&#x2019;s do this after we eat.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;when did you arrive?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;When you were sent flying into the air.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;You should have save me.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Are you a child?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Even if he wasn&apos;t a child, Sunggoo felt as if a rescue was in order.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Let&#x2019;s have a quick meal. &#xA0;Then we are moving.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Maybe it was because the flow of the battle had been interrupted, but Sunggoo welcomed the break.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ooh-oohk?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Was it because the tension dissipated? &#xA0;He felt the magical energy inside him boil. &#xA0;It felt as if he was about to cough out blood. &#xA0;He sat down, and he tried to gain control of his magical energy.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Ah. &#xA0;Hyung-nim knew what would happen, so he stopped it.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">When Sunggoo opened his eyes, Woojin was sitting next to a fire eating some unknown meat skewered onto a stick.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Eat.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Woojin tossed one to Sunggoo. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">Sunggoo bowed his head.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Thank you.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Woojin smirked as he turned his gaze away.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hmm.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">The flames had died down, and the fighting on the battlefield had settled. &#xA0;Woojin had unsummoned his Familiars, and he was sitting next to the fire with only Sunggoo by his side.</span></p><p><span style="">Did they look beatable? &#xA0;New enemies came into view.</span></p><p><span style="">A group of humans were approaching them from a far distance.</span></p>
