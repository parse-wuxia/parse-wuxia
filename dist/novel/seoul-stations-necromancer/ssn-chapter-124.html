<p><strong>Chapter 124 Lich Jaenis (2) .</strong></p><div id="chapterContent" class="innerContent fr-view"><p></p><p dir="ltr">Chapter 124 - Lich Jaenis (2)&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">The two sat across the table, and they sat there for a long time without speaking.</p><p dir="ltr">Coffee had been brought in by a secretary, and enough time had passed that the steam stopped rising from the cooled beverage. The Holy Maiden was the first to speak.</p><p dir="ltr">&#x201C;Did you know about Kahng-sooah-nim&apos;s condition?&#x201D;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&#x201C;I had my suspicions.&#x201D;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&#x201C;&#x2026;&#x2026;.&#x201D;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">There was a silence for awhile as Melody searched for words she wanted to say.</p><p dir="ltr">Still, wasn&apos;t she a member of his family&#x2026;.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&#x201C;What do you plan on doing?&#x201D;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&#x201C;What can I do?&#x201D;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&#x201C;&#x2026;&#x2026;.&#x201D;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">She was his dongsaeng.</p><p dir="ltr">If it was possible, he would have already made her better. However, this wasn&apos;t a matter of healing her or not. The only thing Woojin could do for Sooah was to pray for her.</p><p dir="ltr">&#x201C;I&apos;m not sure who will come&#x2026; It is difficult even for me to even guess.&#x201D;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&#x201C;I&apos;m all right.&#x201D;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&#x201C;&#x2026;&#x2026;.&#x201D;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&#x201C;Sooah is the one, who is suffering.&#x201D;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&#x201C;&#x2026;&#x2026;.&#x201D;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Woojin just felt bitter. &#xA0;He couldn&apos;t definitely say his heart was hurting or not. He just felt a sense of regret&#x2026;.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">His mother was probably having a hard time.</p><p dir="ltr">Sooah was also having a hard time.</p><p dir="ltr">&#x201C;I&apos;m sorry for not being of any help.&#x201D;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&#x201C;You don&apos;t have to be sorry.&#x201D;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Melody knew better than anyone else what kind of pain Sooah was going through. &#xA0;Melody also knew what choice lay in front of Sooah. &#xA0;She had gone also gone through it when she was young.</p><p dir="ltr">Sooah was a God&apos;s Seed.</p><p dir="ltr">He didn&apos;t know whose Seed it was, but when Sooah hears the god&apos;s voice, she would awaken into being a Holy Maiden.</p><p dir="ltr">Woojin had mixed feelings, but there wasn&#x2019;t any unrest in his heart. &#xA0;This surprised him. &#xA0;Was he drifting farther away from humanity...</p><p dir="ltr">&#x201C;What did you want to talk about....&#x201D;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Woojin&apos;s expression was so serious that the Holy Maiden asked her next question with care.</p><p dir="ltr">&#x201C;Ah. &#xA0;I want you to call those in the US to put some pressure on the Korean government.&#x201D;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&#x201C;What?&#x201D;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&#x201C;I raised Alandal, and these people are refusing to acknowledge it. &#xA0;How do you think that makes me feel?&#x201D;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Melody had the eyes of a bunny. &#xA0;She got on her knees.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&#x201C;Oh Immortal. &#xA0;Please have patience. &#xA0;As life as my witness&#x2026;.&#x201D;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&#x201C;Didn&apos;t I tell you to stop bowing so easily?&#x201D;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&#x201C;I&apos;m sorry.&#x201D;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Woojin frowned. He was already having confusion about his own sense of identity, and it didn&apos;t help that the Holy Maiden was treating him like a god...</p><p dir="ltr">&#x201C;I&apos;m not saying our two country can&apos;t bother each other. &#xA0;I just need more freedom. &#xA0;However, Korea keeps trying to tie me up to a post.&#x201D;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">She understood what Woojin was trying to say.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&#x201C;So they are being like the Empire of Uruha.&#x201D;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&#x201C;Mmm. &#xA0;It&apos;s a similar situation.&#x201D;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">The Empire of Uruha tried to give the title of Duke to the Undying King Immortal. &#xA0;They even blathered on about marrying the princess to him. &#xA0;However, the hapless empire was destroyed eventually.</p><p dir="ltr">&#x201C;I&apos;ll make it so that they&apos;ll never bother you again.&#x201D;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">The Holy Maiden bit her firmed lips.</p><p dir="ltr">&#x201C;All right. &#xA0;I&apos;ll see you in 3 days.&#x201D;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">He had a Protection period of 12 days. &#xA0;He had to return to his Dimensional Domain in 3 days in earth&#x2019;s time. &#xA0;Alandal guild was already busy, and the Holy Maiden would also be busy now. &#xA0;Woojin&apos;s thought was racing with the thought of clearing as many Dungeon as possible.</p><p dir="ltr">&#x201C;Three days&#x2026;.&#x201D;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Melody quietly repeated those words.</p><p dir="ltr">She had three days to make Alandal a nation recognized by the world. &#xA0;If she couldn&apos;t, she had no idea what the Immortal would do.</p><p dir="ltr">Both Melody and Woojin felt a countdown of 3 days starting, and the weight of the 3 days differed for each of them.</p><p dir="ltr">***&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Woojin was reunited with a welcoming person at the airport.</p><p dir="ltr">&#x201C;Little brother Kahng!&#x201D;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&#x201C;Baek hyung!&#x201D;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Baek-jongdoh had a big smile on his face when he saw Kahng-woojin also raise his hand in greeting. &#xA0;It felt as if an international celebrity had just acknowledged him.</p><p dir="ltr">&#x201C;Ooh-haha. I get to see you again like this. &#xA0;This is great.&#x201D;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&#x201C;I&#x2019;ll be in your debt for a little bit.&#x201D;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&#x201C;Huh? &#xA0;This won&apos;t incur any debt. &#xA0;Of course, I&apos;ll help you!&#x201D;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">When Bake-jongdoh heard that Alandal requested the use of his private plane, he immediately came over here. &#xA0;His eyes twinkled as he looked at Hong-sunggoo, who was standing next to Woojin.</p><p dir="ltr">&#x201C;So this person is Mr. Flame Sunggoo?&#x201D;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&#x201C;&#x2026;what is up with that cheesy name?&#x201D;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&#x201C;It is quite popular on the SNS. &#xA0;Ooh-haha. &#xA0;Let&apos;s take a picture before we head out.&#x201D;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Baek-jongdoh put his arms around Hong-sunggoo, and he took a selfie.</p><p dir="ltr">In the background, the picture of Kahng-woojin with an expression of dismay was captured.</p><p dir="ltr">&#x201C;Hoo hoo. &#xA0;This is a jackpot. &#xA0;I think I&apos;ll have no problem getting a million views.&#x201D; &#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&#x201C;Heh heh. &#xA0;I&apos;ll help as best as I can, president Baek.&#x201D;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&#x201C;Ooh-huh-huh. &#xA0;With the help of Mr. Flame Sunggoo, I think 10 million views might be possible?&#x201D;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&#x201C;Ooh-heh-heh. &#xA0;I am a bit famous around the world.&#x201D;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">They immediately got along well, and it seemed they had found a kindred spirit. &#xA0;Woojin shook his head as he looked at the two of them, then he got on the plane.</p><p dir="ltr">Baek-johngdo and his personal secretary, director Jung-chansung, got on the plane. &#xA0;On Alandals side, Kahng-woojin, Hong-sunggoo and the chief secretary Woo-soonghoon got on.</p><p dir="ltr">&#x201C;Where are we heading first?&#x201D;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&#x201C;We have to go to Japan.&#x201D;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Soonghoon placed a tablet PC in front of Woojin. &#xA0;There was a world map on the screen, and there were red dots all over it.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&#x201C;How many in total?&#x201D;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&#x201C;There is 32. &#xA0;We&apos;ve received 12 requests to clear them.&#x201D;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Woojin frowned.</p><p dir="ltr">&#x201C;Why is there so few?&#x201D;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&#x201C;There is still some time left, so they want to take care of it with their own forces.&#x201D;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">The 12 requests were sent from places where the Dungeon Breaks were imminent. The schedule was made depending on which Dungeon was closest to Breaking.</p><p dir="ltr">&#x201C;So the blue dots mean they haven&apos;t sent out a request yet?&#x201D;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Woojin expanded the map of Japan. &#xA0;There were two red dots and four blue dots.</p><p dir="ltr">Since there were so many subway stations there, there were 6 uncleared reset Dungeons. &#xA0;Amongst them, two were about to break.</p><p dir="ltr">One was in Osaka, and the other was in Tokyo.</p><p dir="ltr">&#x201C;They saw the mess in Seoul, yet they want to take care of it on their own? &#xA0;Even if the top Roused of the world were gathered to make a special team, it might not be enough.&#x201D;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&#x201C;&#x2026;&#x2026;.&#x201D;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">What could Woo-soonghoon say in regards to Woojin&apos;s bitter words? &#xA0;Baek-jungdoh and Hong-sunggoo had been involved in a rowdy conversation, but they quieted down as they looked at Woojin. &#xA0;Baek-jungdoh lowered his voice.</p><p dir="ltr">&#x201C;Hmm hmm. &#xA0;What&apos;s wrong, lil bro Kahng?&#x201D;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&#x201C;No. &#xA0;I just find this situation to be funny.&#x201D;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&#x201C;What is?&#x201D;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&#x201C;They are basically grabbing onto a reversed sword, yet they still want to be greedy. &#xA0;I find that to be funny.&#x201D;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&#x201C;Hmm. &#xA0;There had been couple Dungeon Breaks, but they eventually defended against the Breaks. &#xA0;They&apos;ve made a lot of investment to minimize the damage.&#x201D;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&#x201C;Well, it isn&apos;t as if I hadn&apos;t expected it, but I still find it silly.&#x201D;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">He already knew what would happen.</p><p dir="ltr">Eventually Woojin wouldn&#x2019;t be able to handle everything by himself, and a Dimensional lord with a successful link would appear.</p><p dir="ltr">Ignorance was bliss. This phrase didn&apos;t exist for nothing. &#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">When he earned the Dimensional Domain, he started to learn a little bit about Trahnet&apos;s dirty little organization. &#xA0;As he learned more, the frustration inside him mounted.</p><p dir="ltr">He couldn&apos;t stop what was coming. &#xA0;Earth was falling into the pit of hell, yet the countries of earth was still squabbling.</p><p dir="ltr">Woojin was probably the only one here, who had seen the pit of hell.</p><p dir="ltr">This was why he wanted to alert everyone&apos;s attention to the coming end. &#xA0;This was why he asked the Hammer guild to prepared a Roused General Assembly, so why wasn&apos;t he hearing any feedback from them?</p><p dir="ltr">&#x201C;Baek hyung. &#xA0;When did they say they are holding the Roused Assembly?&#x201D;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&#x201C;Huh? Don&apos;t we still have 10 days left? &#xA0;Also, why did you leave that to the Hammer guild?&#x201D;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&#x201C;Well, they said they&apos;ll take care of it.&#x201D;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&#x201C;Eh-eeng. You should have put me in charge of it. &#xA0;Hammer guild is one of the 3 great guilds, but how could they hold a candle to our KH guild. &#xA0;Ah. &#xA0;Of course, I&apos;m saying this since lil bro&apos;s Alandal isn&apos;t one of Korea&apos;s guild now. Hahaha!&#x201D;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Woojin also laughed at Baek-jongdoh&apos;s words. Now that he thought about it he hadn&apos;t killed any financial magnates related to the KH guild.</p><p dir="ltr">At the very least, his guild wasn&apos;t related to the Dungeon business nor the backing of the terrorist organizations.</p><p dir="ltr">&#x201C;Do you want to go into the Dungeon with me?&#x201D;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Baek-jongdoh&apos;s eyes uncharacteristically got round.</p><p dir="ltr">&#x201C;You really will let me to tag along?&#x201D;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Kahng-woojin was famous for not teaming up with other Roused. Hong-sunggoo and Che-Haesol were the only teammates he took into the Dungeons when clearing them.</p><p dir="ltr">This was why Hong-sunggoo was known as being Kahng-woojin&apos;s man, and there was a terrifying amount of interest in him. &#xA0;The picture he put up on the SNS already had 20 thousand views.</p><p dir="ltr">&#x201C;Well, I&apos;m going on 3 day world tour, so let&apos;s travel together.&#x201D;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&#x201C;Ooh-hahaha. I&apos;m looking forward to this.&#x201D;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Woojin grinned when he heard the man&apos;s easy laugh.</p><p dir="ltr">He was a decent man.</p><p dir="ltr">He wouldn&apos;t have put his interests aside to bring his private plane if he wasn&apos;t a decent man.</p><p dir="ltr">&#x201C;Hoo hoo hoo. &#xA0;I&apos;ll have to let all my friends in the world know about this. &#xA0;Let&apos;s take a selfie, little bro.&#x201D;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&#x201C;&#x2026;&#x2026;.&#x201D;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Baek-jungdoh stretched out his arm with a camera. &#xA0;Woojin sighed when he saw this.</p><p dir="ltr">&#x201C;Why are we doing this?&#x201D;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&#x201C;What do you mean why? &#xA0;This is the information age. It&apos;s great to announcing everything.&#x201D;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&#x201C;Huh. This isn&apos;t that important, so why do we have to live update everything? &#xA0;Are you going to tell everyone when you shit too?&#x201D;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&#x201C;Huh? How did you know?&#x201D;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&#x201C;&#x2026;&#x2026;.&#x201D;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Woojin was dismayed, but Baek-jungdoh had a serious expression on his face. &#xA0;It seemed he really was someone, who would do that.</p><p dir="ltr">&#x201C;Jeez.&#x201D;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Woojin smirked as he playfully made a V sign with his fingers towards the camera.</p><p dir="ltr">Even though earth had several dozen times the amount of Dungeons than any other planets, they were able to deal with the situation organically. &#xA0;The main reason was the high speed communication capability.</p><p dir="ltr">There weren&apos;t that many planets where a Dungeon break happening on the other side of the world could be identified within 10 minutes.</p><p dir="ltr">KH guild&apos;s private plane was getting ready to land in the Kansai Airport.</p><p dir="ltr">***&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Kansai Airport&apos;s Waiting Area.</p><p dir="ltr">Sensei guild&apos;s Rank A Roused Taguchi frowned as he looked at the crowded airport. &#xA0;He was here to greet an important person, but there were too many people here. &#xA0;He worried there would be an accident.</p><p dir="ltr">&#x201C;Why are there so many people gathered here?&#x201D;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&#x201C;The news that Mr. Kahng-woojin is visiting Osaka was posted on the SNS.&#x201D;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&#x201C;Mmmm?&#x201D;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Taguchi took the handphone from the employee from the support division.</p><p dir="ltr">There was a selfie of Kahng-woojin and the the president of the KH guild, Baek-jungdoh. &#xA0;Kahng-woojin had playful smile on his face. &#xA0;Moreover, there were words written below.</p><p dir="ltr">- I&apos;m on a Dungeon Closing Tour with my close dongsaeng Kahng-woojin. &#xA0;The first destination is Osaka....</p><p dir="ltr">- Uh-muh. &#xA0;Mr. Kahng-woojin is coming to the Kansai airport!</p><p dir="ltr">He didn&apos;t have to translate the Korean words with childish emoticons interspersed within the text. The owner of the account, who had spread the photo of president Baek-jungdoh, had helpfully translated the words into Japanese.</p><p dir="ltr">&#x201C;Whose account is it?&#x201D;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&#x201C;It&apos;s the account of Sakura Ai.&#x201D;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">It took only several minutes for a famous idol in Japan to spread news on the SNS. &#xA0;In a short amount of time, several hundred people had gathered here.</p><p dir="ltr">There were a good portion of the crowd that were holding up large cameras.</p><p dir="ltr">&#x201C;This is a pain in the ass..&#x201D;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">This was a request to close the very first Dungeon found by the Sensei Guild. &#xA0;They had come to greet him like a VIP, yet the information had already been leaked....</p><p dir="ltr">Taguchi started thinking of ways he could extract Kahng-woojin from the Kansai Airport.</p><p dir="ltr">&#x201C;He&apos;s coming out. Uh uh?&#x201D;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&#x201C;&#x2026;&#x2026;.&#x201D;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Taguchi was at a loss for words when he looked at the place his employee was pointing at. It wouldn&apos;t have mattered even if they wanted to escort him away like a VIP.</p><p dir="ltr">Kee-kee-keek.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">There were 30 Skeleton Warriors.</p><p dir="ltr">Their bony collar bones were exposed, and they appeared with their Bone Swords raised. &#xA0;Everyone backed away from them.</p><p dir="ltr">Kahng-woojin was parting the crowd with his monsters escorting him, and he spoke to Woo-soonghoon. &#xA0;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&#x201C;I thought they were suppose to be here to greet us?&#x201D;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&#x201C;Yes. They said they&apos;ll be here, but my Japanese is...&#x201D;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&#x201C;Uh-eego. &#xA0;I thought you wanted to be the minister of foreign affair.&#x201D;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&#x201C;&#x2026;&#x2026;.&#x201D;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Soonghoon had nothing to say. &#xA0;He pouted as his shoulder slumped.</p><p dir="ltr">&#x201C;Come here.&#x201D;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&#x201C;Yes?&#x201D;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&#x201C;Drink this.&#x201D;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&#x201C;Yes, please give it to me.&#x201D;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&#x201C;I&apos;ll feed it to you.&#x201D;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&#x201C;&#x2026;&#x2026;.&#x201D;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Why was the president being this way?</p><p dir="ltr">Soonghoon had several dozen thoughts pass through his head as he struggled to come to a decision. &#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Woojin grabbed his chin, and he forced Soonghoon&apos;s mouth open.</p><p dir="ltr">&#x201C;P...president? Ggo-roo-roohk.&#x201D;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Woojin poured the Language Drug into Soonghoon&apos;s mouth, then he put the empty bottle away into his Inventory.</p><p dir="ltr">&#x201C;Kol-lohk, kuhk!&#x201D;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&#x201C;Now go look for them.&#x201D;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Soonghoon coughed for a long time, then his eyes turned round as he surveyed his surrounding.</p><p dir="ltr">&#x201C;T...this is!&#x201D;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">It was a miracle. &#xA0;A miracle had happened.</p><p dir="ltr">The words in front of his eyes were in Japanese, but he could understand it now.</p><p dir="ltr">&#x201C;Ooh-oohk. Why did a Skeleton troop suddenly show up?&#x201D;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&#x201C;Does this mean Mr. Kahng-woojin doesn&apos;t want to talk at all?&quot;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&#x201C;Is he trying to look down on Japan?&#x201D;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">The conversation from his surrounding was heard through his ears.</p><p dir="ltr">He could understand everything.</p><p dir="ltr">&#x201C;Holy shit.&#x201D;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">While Soonghoon was in awe, Jung-chansung pointed towards a direction. &#xA0;As befitting a director of a major company, he was able to speak Japanese.</p><p dir="ltr">&#x201C;Those people are from the Sensei guild.&#x201D;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">He pointed to a group holding up a sign. &#xA0;Soonghoon was still mumbling to himself.</p><p dir="ltr">&#x201C;Eh-whew. &#xA0;How about director Jung come to work for Alandal?&#x201D;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&#x201C;Haha. &#xA0;I&apos;m thankful for your kind words, but I have to follow president Baek.&#x201D;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Woojin said those words for fun, so he just grinned. Then he walked towards the people from the Sensei guild.</p><p></p><p></p></div><p></p>
