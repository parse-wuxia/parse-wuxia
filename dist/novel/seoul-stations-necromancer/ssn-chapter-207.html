<p>Chapter 207 - Recover (3)</p><p><span style="">Dr. Toppler schooled his expression. </span></p><p><span style="">Did his persuasion work? &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">Kahng-woojin had opened his eyes in the true world, so what was he feeling right now?</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;Did you think about it?&quot;</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;What are you talking about?&quot;</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;The Reset&#x2026; &#xA0;Well, I guess it doesn&#x2019;t matter anymore.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">He had wanted Kahng-woojin, who possessed the Recovery Code, to log out with the Earth&#x2019;s Code. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">The logout had been carried out, but the Earth&#x2019;s Code still remained in Trahnet.</span></p><p><span style="">Kim-kahngchul had been tasked to recover the Code, yet he had failed. &#xA0;Moreover, Toppler had been forcefully logged out. &#xA0;Now he would no longer be able to connect to Trahnet ever again.</span></p><p><span style="">Toppler looked at Kahng-woojin with a serious expression.</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;It isn&#x2019;t too late. &#xA0;I&#x2019;ll show you how to deliver a message to an employee within Alandal. &#xA0;When this person acquires the Earth&#x2019;s Code, we could log him out.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">At Toppler&#x2019;s impassioned words, Kahn-woojin let out an odd laugh.</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;You want me to command my subordinate to kill my dongsaeng?&quot;</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;...no. I&#x2019;m saying we should acquire the Code, and we&#x2019;ll be able to turn back earth to the time before the war started.&quot;</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;That isn&#x2019;t funny.&quot;</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;Please wake up. &#xA0;That place is merely a VR. &#xA0;When the Reset occurs, your sister will still be alive. &#xA0;We aren&#x2019;t killing her. &#xA0;We are going to save earth.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Toppler had angled his body up from the bed, and Kahng-woojin pushed his face towards Toppler.</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;You are mistaken.&quot;</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;.......&quot;</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;My goal is to sever my earth&#x2019;s link to Trahnet. &#xA0;I don&apos;t care about your earth.&quot;</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;.......&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Toppler&#x2019;s face darkened.</span></p><p><span style="">Kahng-woojin had been logged out, but his memories were still unstable. &#xA0;This was what Toppler assumed.</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;We can always turn back the VR, but the reality&#x2026;.&quot;</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;Stop.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Kahng-woojin patted Toppler&#x2019;s shoulder.</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;I came here, because I wanted to confirm something.&quot;</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;......?&quot;</span></p><p><span style=""> What was he talking about? &#xA0;He came here on his own?</span></p><p><span style="">He had ordered Captain Leone to log out Kahng-woojin.</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;I came here to check on your soul.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin&#x2019;s eyes laughed as he looked at Dr. Toppler. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">A leery suspicion Woojin had was resolved. &#xA0;It had been weighing down a part of his heart.</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;W...where are you going?&quot;</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;I have things to do.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">When Woojin turned to leave, Dr. Toppler pointed at Woojin.</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;Why aren&#x2019;t you detaining him?&quot;</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;.......&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">However, the nearby soldiers didn&#x2019;t move an inch even at his insistence. &#xA0;This was also true for Captain Leone.</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;Captain Leone! &#xA0;What are you doing?&quot;</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;Please give it up, professor.&quot;</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;......?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Kahng-woojin possessed the Recovery Code.</span></p><p><span style="">It didn&#x2019;t matter if they hadn&#x2019;t been able to acquire the Earth&#x2019;s Code. &#xA0;They had to find a way to turn back the time.</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;Eeek! &#xA0;If we just let him leave right now....&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">At the very least, the Recovery Code was needed to carry out some form of a Reset. &#xA0;Dr. Toppler got off the bed, and he ran towards Woojin.</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;Stop!&quot;</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;.......&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin was standing on the stairway leading out of the spaceship. &#xA0;Woojin turned, and their eyes met&#x2026;.</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;Uh uh?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Toppler groaned when he felt the sensation of being airborne. &#xA0;It wasn&apos;t just a feeling. &#xA0;His body was really floating in the air. &#xA0;It was as if he had been levitated.</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;Don&#x2019;t follow me. &#xA0;I confirmed what I needed from you..&quot;</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;H...how the hell....&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Dr. Toppler couldn&apos;t believe what was going on. &#xA0;He looked as if he had seen a ghost. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">What had Woojin done? &#xA0;What allowed him to use such supernatural powers?</span></p><p><span style="">He was like the Roused from the VR Earth&#x2026;.</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;You should return to your home, people of the moon.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">When Woojin descended the stairs, the power suspending Toppler in the air disappeared.</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;What the hell is........&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Captain Leone helped the confused Toppler to his feet. &#xA0;He had felt the same emotions as the professor only a few minutes ago.</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;Maybe, he is no longer a human. &#xA0;Please give up, professor.&quot;</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;What nonsense are you....&quot;</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;Isn&#x2019;t this the parameters of this project? &#xA0;Since the contents of the VR world is now appearing in reality&#x2026; &#xA0;&#xA0;It is the start of the Terraforming.&quot;</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;But....&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Was it a side effect? &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">This might be an unpredicted variable.</span></p><p><span style="">This was something that couldn&#x2019;t be proved with science. &#xA0;His supernatural power was beyond the ken of mortal men.</span></p><p><span style="">What could possibly be the explanation behind this development?</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;This...at this rate.......&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Dr. Toppler ran towards the stairs in a mesmerized state.</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;Professor! Your respirator!&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">It was unclear as to whether he heard the soldier&#x2019;s warning, but Toppler continued to run down the stairs.</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;Hoo-oop.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">The air was thick and pungent with particles. &#xA0;It felt as if he had sand in his mouth. &#xA0;He didn&#x2019;t have to travel long before he saw Kahng-woojin.</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;Please wait for me! &#xA0;Cough.&quot;</span></p><p><span style=""> Toppler coughed as he ran. &#xA0;He approached Kahng-woojin.</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;What is it?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Kahng-woojin replied as if he was a bit annoyed.</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;Where are you going?&quot;</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;What will you do if I tell you?&quot;</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;Please just tell me what you are going to do.&quot;</span></p><p><span style=""> What was he going to do&#x2026;.</span></p><p><span style=""> Kahng-woojin looked upwards.</span></p><p><span style="">The stars filled the sky as they let out a bright light. &#xA0;Unlike this beautiful sight, the ground was black.</span></p><p><span style="">The land was desolate, and one couldn&#x2019;t even see a single blade of grass.</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;I&#x2019;ll be going back.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">He already knew how to sever the link.</span></p><p><span style="">The knowledge was inside his head when he woke up. &#xA0;It was as if he he had learned it from a Skill Book.</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;The VR Earth was about to collapse right before I was awakened. &#xA0;Even if you go back, the people of Alandal&#x2026;.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Professor Toppler spoke carefully as he studied the other man.</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;Did you see it for sure?&quot;</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;.......&quot;</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;Did you see them die?&quot;</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;I didn&#x2019;t see their final moments, but they were found inadequate in dealing with the absolute being&#x2026;.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Toppler swallowed his words. &#xA0;Woojin&#x2019;s deep eyes was looking at him, and he couldn&#x2019;t be rash with his words.</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;You can&#x2019;t see the future, so how do you know that?&quot;</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;.......&quot;</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;My guys won&#x2019;t go down that easily.&quot;</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;Even if they are still holding out, how are you going to log back in?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Kahng-woojin was in the same boat as Kim-kahngchul. &#xA0;They could no longer log back in. &#xA0;It was the same for Toppler, who hadn&#x2019;t been able to log out through an arranged exit.</span></p><p><span style="">Previously, they had each foot planted in both worlds, but now their foothold in the VR was gone.</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;If I can&#x2019;t go there....&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin grinned.</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;...I&#x2019;ll bring them here.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">***</span></p><p><span style="">The barrier of Bibi&#x2019;s Castle was damaged.</span></p><p><span style="">Koo-ooh-oong!</span></p><p><span style="">The buildings on the aircraft carrier shook violently. &#xA0;The people, who were evacuated inside, was trembling from fear.</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;Is there&#x2026;. &#xA0;Can we....do nothing?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Jung-minchan spoke in a despairing voice.</span></p><p><span style="">They were using every ounce of their power to fight back, but the Black Armor&#x2019;s power was beyond imagination.</span></p><p><span style="">Everyone was exhausted&#x2026;. &#xA0;This was also true for the Undead Army.</span></p><p><span style=""> [We are low on energy.]</span></p><p><span style="">This was the crux of the problem.</span></p><p><span style="">Kahn-woojin wasn&#x2019;t here.</span></p><p><span style="">The being, who replenished their ranks through raising the enemy&#x2019;s corpses, was gone. &#xA0;Their magical energy was no longer being replenished through the consumption of the enemy&#x2019;s souls.</span></p><p><span style="">Since the Necromancer was absent, the Undead army had been reduced steadily. &#xA0;Only the Familiars were left.</span></p><p><span style="">The Lich had never had to worry about the use of its magic when it was with its Necromancer. &#xA0;However, it was ownerless right now, and it had to judicious with its use of magic. &#xA0;This was why it could only act as a diversion from the back.</span></p><p><span style="">The Death Knights were tireless, but now they had to worry about defense. &#xA0;They couldn&#x2019;t commit to an all out attack.</span></p><p><span style="">The Bone Dragon and the Golem was also short of magical energy. &#xA0;They had to wait a while, before they were able to regenerate their broken bodies.</span></p><p><span style=""> [Goo-ha-ha-ha.]</span></p><p><span style="">Either the Black Armor didn&#x2019;t know how to speak, or it didn&#x2019;t want to speak. &#xA0;It kept letting out its weird laughter as black energy shot out from its fists. &#xA0;Each strike created incredible damage.</span></p><p><span style=""> Kwahhhhhhng!</span></p><p><span style="">There was a big hole made through the hull of Bibi&#x2019;s Castle. &#xA0;The unlucky employees fell from the sky.</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;Kyahhhhh!&quot;</span></p><p><span style=""> A phoenix flew towards the falling people.</span></p><p><span style="">Hwah-roo-roohk.</span></p><p><span style="">Rings of fire wrapped around the people, and the phoenix landed atop the deck.</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;T...thank you.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">He didn&#x2019;t have time to acknowledge their gratitude.</span></p><p><span style="">Alandal had been able to hold out for a week against the Black Armor&#x2019;s attacks. &#xA0;Hong-sunggoo and Che-haesol deserved the most credit for their survival.</span></p><p><span style="">Hong-sunggoo didn&#x2019;t have a single wound on his body, but this was thanks to his body&#x2019;s peculiar attributes. &#xA0;He was very exhausted inside.</span></p><p><span style="">He was making an unreasonable demand of his body by pushing well beyond his limits.</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;Ha-ah. &#xA0;Is there any way we could resolve this problem?&quot;</span></p><p><span style=""> [Goo-ha-ha-ha!]</span></p><p><span style=""> Kwah-ahng, kwahng!</span></p><p><span style="">A water dragon flew into the air as it became entangled with the Black Armor. &#xA0;They exchanged attacks.</span></p><p><span style=""> [Goo-oh-oh-oh!]</span></p><p><span style="">The water dragon let out a long cry. &#xA0;It could no longer withstand the power of the enemy&#x2019;s fists.</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;That was the last water dragon.......&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Che-haesol mumbled to herself. &#xA0;It was as if she was in a state of despair.</span></p><p><span style="">The water dragons had been the strongest beings left alive on Alphen. &#xA0;They were all dead now.</span></p><p><span style=""> [Goo-roo-roohk!]</span></p><p><span style="">Sunggoo&#x2019;s eyes took in the sight of the broken Blood Dragon resting on the deck.</span></p><p><span style="">The Colony&#x2019;s energy had bottomed out, so there weren&#x2019;t enough magical energy to regenerate the Bone Dragon&#x2019;s body.</span></p><p><span style="">One wing had been ripped away&#x2026;.</span></p><p><span style="">The Blood Golem looked like clotted blood around the Bone Dragon, and chunks of it was missing. &#xA0;The wounded Blood Dragon roared.</span></p><p><span style=""> [This Dragon will not die!]</span></p><p><span style="">The Ancient Dragon had lived for over a 1,000 years, &#xA0;and it had an earnest wish right now.</span></p><p><span style="">The members of its race was dead&#x2026; &#xA0;&#xA0;They had defected...</span></p><p><span style="">It had tried its best to forget the humiliating history of its race&#x2026; &#xA0;Since it couldn&#x2019;t rewrite the history, it will disappear with it.</span></p><p><span style="">Yong Yong, who had been crouching, stood up. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">The head, which was attached to a long neck, headed towards Hong-sunggooo.</span></p><p><span style="">The shining red eyes of the Bone Dragon gazed at Hong-sunggoo.</span></p><p><span style="">The thick scent of someone from its own race emanated from him&#x2026;.</span></p><p><span style=""> [What is your wish?]</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;My wish....&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Sunggoo looked at the Black Armor.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;It would be great if you would kill that bastard.&quot;</span></p><p><span style=""> [I will grant you your wish!]</span></p><p><span style="">It was time to bring about its most earnest wish.</span></p><p><span style="">It didn&#x2019;t want to live again.</span></p><p><span style="">It just wanted to fly again.</span></p><p><span style="">It also wanted to feel that sensation once again.</span></p><p><span style=""> [Give me my last Breath!]</span></p><p><span style="">If it could fly and breathe in air, how could it be a dead Dragon?</span></p><p><span style="">It had forgotten even its own name, but it wasn&#x2019;t dead yet.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;That is a great idea.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Sunggoo grinned as he ignited his body into a ball of flame. &#xA0;The flame was like smoke. &#xA0;It was sucked in towards Yong Yong&#x2019;s nostrils.</span></p><p><span style=""> [Koo-oh-oh!]</span></p><p><span style="">Jaenis extended its hands towards the roaring Dragon.</span></p><p><span style=""> [I will give you all my power!]</span></p><p><span style="">The Colony&#x2019;s energy had run out, so the Lich poured out all its magical energy from its own Life Vessel.</span></p><p><span style="">Chwe-roo-roo-roohk!</span></p><p><span style="">The various destroyed parts of Yong Yong was quickly regenerating.</span></p><p><span style="">[Only victory will let us sidestep death!]</span></p><p><span style="">The Death Knights ran forward, and they all extended their hands to transfer their magical energy into the Bone Dragon.</span></p><p><span style="">They wouldn&#x2019;t retreat, because the enemy was powerful.</span></p><p><span style="">Victory or death.</span></p><p><span style="">They were already dead, so a second death didn&#x2019;t exist for them.</span></p><p><span style=""> [Koo-oh!]</span></p><p><span style="">As if it couldn&#x2019;t control its overflowing power, the Blood Dragon leap caused Bibi&#x2019;s Castle to rock back and forth..</span></p><p><span style=""> [Goo-hoo-hoo.]</span></p><p><span style="">It had already killed 17 water dragons. &#xA0;The Black Armor laughed when it saw its next opponent. The Blood Dragon was a tenacious bastard. &#xA0;It kept returning to the flying ship for repairs after taking a little bit of damage.</span></p><p><span style=""> [Goo-roong, goo-roong.]</span></p><p><span style="">The Blood Dragon was in a slightly different state.</span></p><p><span style=""> It didn&#x2019;t throw itself forward in a ruthless attack. &#xA0;It slowly flapped its wings as it glared at the Black Armor. &#xA0;Its stomach expanded before it became smaller. &#xA0;The Blood Dragon was breathing.</span></p><p><span style="">It was supposed to be a dead Dragon with only its bones remaining.</span></p><p><span style="">It was a fake wearing a skin made out of blood.</span></p><p><span style="">However, the red eyes of the Blood Dragon was filled with confidence.</span></p><p><span style=""> [.......]</span></p><p><span style="">The Black Armor realized that it had to take this seriously. &#xA0;It focused on the Blood Dragon&#x2019;s stomach. &#xA0;It was moving periodically&#x2026;
