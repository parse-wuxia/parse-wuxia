<p>Chapter 193 - Blood Dragon (2)</p><p><span style="">Shwaaahk.</span></p><p><span style="">An enormous red body was flying through the sky.</span></p><p><span style="">[What is my name?]</span></p><p><span style="">It didn&#x2019;t remember previous name before it was named Yong Yong. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">Blood was being pumped by the Golem&#x2019;s Heart, and it was a familiar sensation to the Dragon.</span></p><p><span style="">Ancient Dragon.</span></p><p><span style="">It felt as if the surging blood would allow it to regain its sense of self.</span></p><p><span style="">Shwaaahk!</span></p><p><span style="">The Dragon flew up into the sky at an incredible speed, and it barrelled into the Crow, who had been flying in circles.</span></p><p><span style="">[You are an odd one.]</span></p><p><span style="">At the Crow&#x2019;s short observation, Yong Yong opened its jaw in response.</span></p><p><span style="">Kwah-jeek!</span></p><p><span style="">The Crow planned on dodging, but it couldn&#x2019;t. &#xA0;After gaining blood and wings, Yong Yong&#x2019;s movements couldn&#x2019;t be compared to before.</span></p><p><span style="">Moreover, his strength had become so strong that Yong Yong&#x2019;s teeth was able to plunge into Ibrit&#x2019;s wing. &#xA0;It broke through the knife-like feathers and its leather.</span></p><p><span style="">It was a simple act of biting, yet the damage it dealt was beyond imagination.</span></p><p><span style="">Kwah-jeek!</span></p><p><span style="">Yong Yong gripped Ibrit&#x2019;s body with its claws. &#xA0;While its teeth were lodged inside the wing, Yong Yong twisted its midsection.</span></p><p><span style="">[Koo-ah-ahk!]</span></p><p><span style="">The sound of destruction was loud.</span></p><p><span style="">The wing was ripped away as Ibrit writhed.</span></p><p><span style="">Hoo-ooh-oong&#xFF0C;hoo-ooh-oong!</span></p><p><span style="">It wouldn&#x2019;t have been strange if they plummeted to the ground, but Yong Yong&#x2019;s powerful beat of its wings kept both of them in midair.</span></p><p><span style="">[You brutish bastard!]</span></p><p><span style="">Kwah-jeek!</span></p><p><span style="">Yong Yong spat out the wing that filled its mouth, then it immediately bit Ibrit&#x2019;s head.</span></p><p><span style="">[This doesn&#x2019;t make any sense.]</span></p><p><span style="">Ibrit could smell a foul stench coming from the Dragon.</span></p><p><span style="">The smell of blood gave Ibrit a headache. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">The black maw of Yong Yong had encased the whole head of Ibrit, and the Crows body started to burn.</span></p><p><span style="">Hwah-roo-roo.</span></p><p><span style="">The black body was on fire, and the flame ran along the feathers.</span></p><p><span style="">The wings were now made out of fire.</span></p><p><span style="">Once the fire died down, Ibrit would &#xA0;be able to regenerate itself.</span></p><p><span style="">The heat was filling up Yong Yong&#x2019;s mouth, but there was nothing within its mouth that would be burned by the immense heat.</span></p><p><span style="">Kwah-doo-doohk!</span></p><p><span style="">Yong Yong bit off the the Crow&#x2019;s head, and he swallowed it alongside the scorching heat.</span></p><p><span style="">Pah-pah-paht.</span></p><p><span style="">Ibrit&#x2019;s body turned into gray light as it disappeared, and the Blood Dragon roared into the air.</span></p><p><span style="">[Your wish has come true.]</span></p><p><span style="">Once it finished what it had to do, Yong Yong started to descend.</span></p><p><span style="">The monsters, who had been madly charging forward, came to a halt.</span></p><p><span style="">These beings had been blindly charging forward towards their target, but the battle ended when these monsters started worrying about their own lives.</span></p><p><span style="">When Woojin saw the confused monsters, the tension left his body..</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;It seems Yong Yong has killed it.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Once Ibrit was killed, these monsters were no longer an army. &#xA0;The only thing left was for the monsters to be slaughtered by the Undead Army.</span></p><p><span style="">As if to confirm his conjecture, the Blood Dragon landed next to him.</span></p><p><span style="">Koo-ooh-oohng.</span></p><p><span style="">The waters of the Hahn river made waves, and islands of corpses started to form in some parts of the river. &#xA0;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">If he had completed the Thrash&#x2019;s set, he might have been able to revive all the corpses here as Undeads.</span></p><p><span style="">The Blood Dragon trampled over the corpses. &#xA0;It asked a question as it brought its head towards Woojin.</span></p><p><span style="">[What is your wish?]</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin smirked as he placed his hand on its horn.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I want to fly with you.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">He jumped on the back of Yong Yong.</span></p><p><span style="">Koo-ooh-oohng!</span></p><p><span style="">Accompanying a powerful push off, the Dragon flew into the air.</span></p><p><span style="">Shelter.</span></p><p><span style="">Woo-soonghoon and the employees could only monitor the outside situation through the enormous monitor and the radio. &#xA0;They focused on the stations that were still able to broadcast.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x300C;This is amazing. &#xA0;The Prime Minister said before that all of Alandal&#x2019;s power resides within its king. &#xA0;We had assumed it to be a lie. &#xA0;However, before the situation could devolve into the worst possible situation, he saved Seoul.&#x300D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Huh. &#xA0;I have no words to say.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Shit. &#xA0;Why did it take him so long to come back?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ah ah. &#xA0;Dongmin-ah. &#xA0;My baby&#x2026; &#xA0;Hoo-hook.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Some shouted with joy. &#xA0;Others yelled out with words full of despair and complaint. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">Woo-soonghoon and the employees quietly exited the shelter. &#xA0;The surrounding was a mess as if a bomb had been dropped in their midst. &#xA0;The soldiers and Roused were patrolling the streets as they took down the pockets of remaining monsters. &#xA0;They also rescued the injured people.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hoo-ooh. &#xA0;Our king is incredible.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;It makes me proud to be a citizen of Alandal.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The employees had been conscious of the people inside the shelter, but they started speaking their mind when they exited the shelter.</span></p><p><span style="">When Kahng-woojin went to Alphen, Alandal had received international pressure. &#xA0;They had faced a lot of stress, because of it.</span></p><p><span style="">Moreover, Koreans had been the strongest in their criticism. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">They threw around words like traitors, deserters and even cowards towards the people of Alandal. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">They kept trying to chip away and disparage Alandal. &#xA0;The media scraped the bottom of the barrel in bringing out their criticisms, and it had caused the people of Alandal to become sick and tired of them.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Uh uh? &#xA0;L...look over there, chief!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Uh?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">When Woo-soonghoon looked towards the direction pointed out by the employee, he saw an enormous monster flying towards them.</span></p><p><span style="">Koo-ooh-oohng.</span></p><p><span style="">The being made the wide 10 lane road feel cramped</span></p><p><span style="">The monster landed, and it pushed through the cars on the street. &#xA0;Everyone gulped at the sight.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;It feels as if an apartment building is crawling towards us.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">They were frozen by the monster&#x2019;s overwhelming size and pressure. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">When the Blood Dragon reached the group, it dropped its head towards the ground.</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin slid down the neck before he stopped on top of the Dragon&#x2019;s head. &#xA0;The fear and tension on the faces of the employees receded.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;My king!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Get on. Let&#x2019;s go.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin spoke stiffly as if nothing unusual was happening. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">Woo-soonghoon quickly moved to comply.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Where should we get on?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ah&#x2026;.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">A single talon was larger than a person, and a regular person would have to climb up the Dragon as if one was climbing up a cliff. </span></p><p><span style="">When Woojin raised his hand, a soft magical energy surrounded the employees. &#xA0;They were lifted onto the back of Yong Yong.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Huh-uh.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Oohk. &#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">This was contrary to their expectations. &#xA0;The smell of blood was thick, and the faces of several employees darkened as they gagged.</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin titled his head in confusion as he looked backwards.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;We haven&#x2019;t even lifted off, yet you guys are already suffering from motion sickness?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Haha. &#xA0;I...I guess so.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Woo-soonghoon&#x2019;s face was also blue. &#xA0;However, he let out an awkward laugh as he agreed with Woojin. &#xA0;Woojin put up a barrier around them again.</span></p><p><span style="">Koo-ooh-oohng.</span></p><p><span style="">The Blood Dragon pushed off the ground, and while in the air, the employees didn&#x2019;t have time to worry about the smell of the blood. &#xA0;The barrier was blocking the wind, but it was up to them to cling to the body of the Dragon.</span></p><p><span style="">The Blood Dragon quickly left Seoul.</span></p><p><span style="">The news helicopter flew over the battlefield as the sound of the battlefield died down.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;King Kahng-woojin of Alandal has left without giving any comments. &#xA0;The army and the guilds are clearing the&#x2026;.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The camera panned the surrounding, and one could see beings that looked similar to humans amongst the monsters.</span></p><p><span style="">There were people that looked too human to be called beings of a different race. &#xA0;The camera also took in the sight of the enormous and unreal Symbol called the Thorn Tree.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Is this the moment when the invasions from alien planets hit their stride? &#xA0;Koreans might have to abandon Seoul.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">There were too many Dungeons in Seoul.</span></p><p><span style="">He would become the ruler.</span></p><p><span style="">Zzuh-juh-juhng.</span></p><p><span style="">The ground near Iello froze, and a pillar of ice extended from the ground. &#xA0;It stretched towards the Thorn Tree..</span></p><p><span style="">As the road of ice formed, Lee-sahgho surveyed the cluttered surrounding.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Isn&#x2019;t this place a bit too quiet?&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">This was supposed to be the sight of a fierce battle, yet he felt a weird sense of dissonance. &#xA0;He looked at the corpses and the broken buildings. &#xA0;Every sign indicated that this was the site of the battle, yet it was too quiet.</span></p><p><span style="">There no sounds of explosions or shouts.</span></p><p><span style="">Ring ring.</span></p><p><span style="">His handphone had let out an alert. &#xA0;Lee-sahngho&#x2019;s face hardened when he read the screen.</span></p><p><span style="">[Kahg-woojin has already pilfered that place. &#xA0;Recommend retreat.]</span></p><p><span style="">Lee-sahngho&#x2019;s expression crumpled when he saw the text from his employee.</span></p><p><span style="">He quickly searched the internet.</span></p><p><span style="">He saw the breaking news informing the defeat of Ibrit, and the pacification of the wide outbreak of Dungeons in Seoul. &#xA0;There was also a video showing an unknown red dragon fighting Ibrit.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Shit. &#xA0;We were a step too late.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">He had implemented a plan with a fail-safe, yet Kahng-woojin had managed to return from Alphen.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Those damn Japanese.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">His expectation had not been high. &#xA0;However, he expected them to stall Woojin for couple days. &#xA0;However, they had only delayed Woojin for a day.</span></p><p><span style="">The battle had already come to an end.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Iello-nim. &#xA0;Currently&#x2026;.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The pillar of ice kept elongating as if water was being shot out from a fountain&#x2026;.</span></p><p><span style="">The pillar of ice was still growing, and it was approaching the Thorn Tree.</span></p><p><span style="">An Ice Human had made his entrance on an already concluded battlefield&#x2026;.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Shit!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">He wouldn&#x2019;t be viewed as a savior. &#xA0;He would be perceived as a new invader.</span></p><p><span style="">Koo-ooh-oohng.</span></p><p><span style="">The enormous flying fortress wobbled. &#xA0;The Wyverns had gathered at an empty spot on the deck. &#xA0;However, they were chased away when the Blood Dragon landed. &#xA0;The appearance of the Blood Dragon created a big fuss inside Bibi&#x2019;s castle.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ooh-ehhhhhhk.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">They didn&#x2019;t have the energy to throw up anymore. &#xA0;However, it seemed when the tension had left their body, they felt the need to gag even though nothing was coming up. &#xA0;&#xA0;Woojin jumped off the Dragon as he left behind his employees.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Master!!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">In a single bound, the succubus jumped into his arms.</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin&#x2019;s expression stiffened at Bibi&#x2019;s hug.</span></p><p><span style="">He didn&#x2019;t really care if she was wearing a risque outfit. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">She could no longer be called a little demon. &#xA0;She was in a form he became familiar with on Alphen, and there was only one reason why she would be in this form.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;As expected, the Synchronization has come to an end.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes. I can use all my powers now.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Bibi spoke in a proud manner, but she didn&#x2019;t seem too happy. &#xA0;The Illusion Witch was powerful now, but this also meant their opponents had regained their strength too.</span></p><p><span style="">All the Dimensional lords would be able to use their power as if earth was their home.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;We&#x2019;ve been waiting for your return.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Jung-minchan gave his greeting. &#xA0;Sooah and his mother stood next to Minchan, and Do-jaemin stood behind them as a reliable guard. &#xA0;Then there was Do-jiwon...</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;You&#x2019;ve done well.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin grinned at his mother&#x2019;s words. &#xA0;Sooah held her mother&#x2019;s hand, and it seemed she felt awkward, since she hadn&#x2019;t seen her oppa in several days.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Mother is busy, so I&#x2019;ll see you later. &#xA0;You do what you have to do.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">She knew he was busy. &#xA0;After she saw his face, his mother excused herself.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;My king. &#xA0;Shouldn&#x2019;t you go meet&#x2026;.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Woojin shook Jung-minchan&#x2019;s hand as he cut him off.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Why did you send the Daken guild?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What? &#xA0;They volunteered to be the advance group in using the Gate&#x2026;.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">It seemed Minchan still didn&#x2019;t know about their betrayal.</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin nodded his head as if it wasn&#x2019;t a big deal.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Well, we can talk about it later. &#xA0;So how many locations had Dungeon Breaks like Seoul?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Almost every one of them suffered the same fate. &#xA0;There are still a lot of cities that are unable to recover from this event.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Fortunately, England was in the final stages of stabilizing the situation. &#xA0;In the first place, most of the population had been moved to a enormous refuge where they were far from the subway stations.</span></p><p><span style="">Since they didn&#x2019;t have to worry about civilian casualties, the army would use their weapons with abandon.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Still, the situation in England is almost stabilized thanks to Bibi-nim&#x2019;s efforts.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">When Woojin turned to look at her, Bibi had a bright smile on her face.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I killed a Dimensional lord by myself.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Good job. &#xA0;So what&#x2019;s the closest country going through an on-going Break?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;It&#x2019;s Greece. &#xA0;We were about to head there. &#xA0;However, there is someone here you should meet before we do that.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Bibi&#x2019;s castle was moving across the sky.</span></p><p><span style="">Their destination was Greece.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Who is it?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Jung-minchan answered in a careful manner. &#xA0;After resolving the Dungeon Breaks in England, a person had come aboard Bibi&#x2019;s Castle in an attempt to meet Kahng-woojin.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;It&#x2019;s Kim-kahngchul.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ho-oh.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin&#x2019;s eyebrows twitched. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">He came here out of his own volition?</span></p>
