<p><span style="">Chapter 152 - Thrash&#x2019;s Protection</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Relick.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">[Did you call me?] </span></p><p><span style="">At Woojin&apos;s call, black smoke solidified to form Relick. &#xA0;He was on one knee as he showed his respect.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Bring me that.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">[&#x2026;&#x2026;.] </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Cut down anyone, who gets in your way.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">[&#x2026;I follow your order.] </span></p><p><span style="">Since he knew what the piece of cloth hung atop the tower meant to his people, he hesitated before he moved.</span></p><p><span style="">Relick almost flew towards the tower, and he brought back a billowing piece of cloth. &#xA0;There was unrest in the town, and a group from the Ratick tribe came running towards them.</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin took the piece of cloth being offered respectfully by Relick. The Warriors from the Ratick tribe started backing away in fear when they saw this.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Thrash&apos;s Protection.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">The Protection Cape was part of the Trash&apos;s Set Items.</span></p><p><span style="">He never expected to see it here.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Stop!&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Accompanying a booming shout, an old man from the Ratick tribe appeared. &#xA0;The Warriors respectfully bowed their heads towards him.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Chieftain.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">He was the highest ranked adult here. &#xA0;He was their leader.</span></p><p><span style="">Chieftain Pepio glared at Woojin.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;That&apos;s the God of Destruction&apos;s holy relic! &#xA0;It isn&apos;t an item that should be taken by a lowly Predator!&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;You know about the God of Destruction?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">At Woojin&apos;s question, a vein bulged out from the side of Pepio&apos;s neck.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;He is one of the Primal gods. &#xA0;Even the ignorant and arrogant Predators runs away from him.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;&#x2026;.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Woojin smiled.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Will you block me from taking this?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">[&#x2026;&#x2026;.] </span></p><p><span style="">Relick became more nervous at Woojin&apos;s question.</span></p><p><span style="">He was saying he would kill anyone, who got in his way.</span></p><p><span style="">Chieftain Pepio snorted.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hoong! Predators may arrogantly act as if they are gods, but this is a holy relic from a true god. Your body will melt the moment you put it on.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Woojin&apos;s eyes shone.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;So it will melt one&apos;s body?&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">If a Dimensional lord took the Thrash&apos;s Set Item for himself, his body would melt away...</span></p><p><span style="">&lt;Damaged Thrash&apos;s Protection&gt; </span></p><p><span style="">This is Thrash&apos;s Protection armor and cape.</span></p><p><span style="">The shoulder armor and breastplate is missing. &#xA0;Only the cape is left.</span></p><p><span style="">It&apos;s true effect cannot be displayed.</span></p><p><span style="">Effect : Control + 100, Sealed, Sealed, Sealed </span></p><p><span style="">Skill : Infinite Soul Storage, Sealed, Sealed </span></p><p><span style="">Set Effect : Sealed </span></p><p><span style="">It had many effects, but most of it was sealed since the Item was damaged. &#xA0;Even the Control Stat that was present was much lower than its original Option.</span></p><p><span style="">However, the number of souls hovering around him as the Spirit Armor won&apos;t have an upper limit any more with this Item. He would have to always wear the cape, but the effect in provided was an incredible Skill.</span></p><p><span style="">If he could store tens of thousands of souls, he could block any surprise attacks and ambushes. &#xA0;Even if a nuclear bomb went off around him, his barrier of Souls would allow him to survive it.</span></p><p><span style="">The name was apt. &#xA0;It really was an item with Thrash&apos;s Protection.</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin kept grinning as he looked at the old cloth. &#xA0;A Warrior standing next to Pepio whispered into his ear.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What do we do? &#xA0;If we lose that Item, we&apos;ll have to live out our lives as nomads.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">There was only one reason why the Ratick race had put up Thrash&apos;s Protection as a flag.</span></p><p><span style="">The holy relic let out a dismal curse just from its presence. &#xA0;Its mere presence stopped the regular monsters from approaching it. &#xA0;Of course, if a Predator was leading a horde to attack them, then the Item wasn&apos;t enough.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Don&apos;t worry about it. &#xA0;The moment he takes it for himself he&apos;ll die from the curse.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Pepio was sure of this.</span></p><p><span style="">In his lifetime, he had seen 3 Dimensional lords put it on, and he had seen all three of them die.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;This might work out better for us.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">The Predator, who had threatened their village, was about to swallow a poison.</span></p><p><span style="">Everyone&apos;s eyes followed Woojin&apos;s hands, which held the cape.</span></p><p><span style="">Pul-ruhk.</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin billowed out the cape once to get rid of the dust, then he put it around his neck. Since he didn&apos;t have the breastplate, it was hard to tell the difference from his outward appearance, but Woojin could feel his Stat immediately increase. He also felt the the force limiting his Spirit Armor&apos;s Soul Storage disappear. </span></p><p><span style="">Woojin let out a satisfied laugh. &#xA0;Pepio&apos;s two eyes widened, and he shook his head as if he couldn&apos;t believe what just happened.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;How come the curse...&#x2026;.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">In the past, everyone who had put on the cloak had died. &#xA0;However, the Predator in front of his eyes...</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;How... &#xA0;How can this be?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Woojin spoke to the surprised Pepio.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I&apos;ll take this. &#xA0;If you have any grievance, hurry up and tell me.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;&#x2026;.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">If he expressed his grievance, Pepio knew he would be killed.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Just go.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;All right. Let&apos;s not cross path in the future.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">He had gained a spoil of war without actually fighting. &#xA0;Since his limit on Soul Storage was gone, he was a little bit disappointed that he couldn&apos;t harvest the Ratick tribe&apos;s souls. &#xA0;However, there were still a lot of monsters left.</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin turned away in a good mood, and Pepio sank to the floor.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;The legend&#x2026;.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Chieftain!&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Raksha ran forward to prop up the Chieftain.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;The God of Destruction&apos;s&#x2026;. In the end, the Planet will be destroyed.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;&#x2026;.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">It was a Predator that ate the other Predators.</span></p><p><span style="">The God of Destruction&apos;s new Collector had appeared on Planet Jaku, and he had taken the relic for himself.</span></p><p><span style="">Raksha had a complicated light in her eyes as she watched Kahng-woojin disappear.</span></p><p><span style="">*** </span></p><p><span style="">They had spent 3 days near the Colony as they hunted down the monsters, but in the end, they had fallen into a trap.</span></p><p><span style="">Their confidence had soared as they got comfortable working with each other. &#xA0;This was when they decided to attack their enemy&apos;s weak spot. However, the table had been turned, and the party was forced into a corner.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Shit.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Baek-jungdo let out a curse word.</span></p><p><span style="">He had received Blanka&apos;s Buffs, but his body was littered with wounds.</span></p><p><span style="">Weeeeeeng. </span></p><p><span style="">Melody&apos;s Prayer surrounded his body as it healed him. If it wasn&apos;t for her, he would have been dead long ago.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;We are at our limit.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Even in such an extreme situation, Haesol had calmly led her party, but she was out of ideas now. &#xA0;They were like mice that had fallen into a jar. &#xA0;They could struggle, but they were already inside the jar.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What about the Immortal?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">At Melody&apos;s words, Jaemin put on an apologetic expression.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I contacted him, but he is far away. &#xA0;It will take him a quarter of a day to get here.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">If seen in a certain light, this was all his fault.</span></p><p><span style="">He had become overconfident as his Stats grew exponentially. His thirst for blood grew, and Do-jaemin had run amok drunk on his own power.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;It is my fault. &#xA0;I should have been more careful.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;No. I made the decision. &#xA0;You don&apos;t have to feel any guilt.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Jaemin couldn&apos;t lift his head even as he heard Haesol&apos;s words. </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;If you weren&apos;t here, we would have died long ago.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">It was as Haesol had said. If it wasn&apos;t for Jaemin&apos;s explosive attack power, they wouldn&apos;t have even been able to survive here.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Well, we aren&#x2019;t dead yet, and we are wasting time talking about this. &#xA0;Let&#x2019;s hold out as long as we can.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes, hyung.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Do-jaemin clamped his lips together. &#xA0;A mistake was a mistake. &#xA0;However, he couldn&#x2019;t act as if they were already dead in front of his teammates. &#xA0;The task looked insurmountable, but they had to somehow last until Kahng-woojin showed up.</span></p><p><span style="">Kuwehhhhhhh! </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;It seem another horde is coming our way again. &#xA0;Let&apos;s get ready&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes!&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">They had experienced urgent battles where their lives were in each other&#x2019;s hands. &#xA0;The camaraderie between the party members had gotten much deeper, and it couldn&#x2019;t be compared to what it was 3 days ago.</span></p><p><span style="">When facing an incredible number of enemies, &#xA0;they had made the mistake of heading towards a canyon.</span></p><p><span style="">As the road narrowed, the party had to face fewer number of enemies. &#xA0;It was quite advantageous for them to fight here except there was nowhere to run. &#xA0;After an endless battle, they couldn&#x2019;t help, but be fatigued.</span></p><p><span style="">They were barely holding up, because of Melody and Blanka&#x2019;s support magics.</span></p><p><span style="">Baek-junkgo and Do-jaemin stepped forward towards the horde of orcs charging towards them.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Since healing magic doesn&apos;t work on you, don&apos;t over do it.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes, hyung&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Melody couldn&apos;t heal Jaemin, since he had become a vampire. He had to drink blood to heal himself or Blanka had to cast support magic like the recovery magic.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Let&apos;s go.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Baek-jungdo&apos;s fists were dyed black as he ran forward. &#xA0;Do-jaemin ran at a speed twice as fast as the Bake-jungdo. &#xA0;His movement was very different compared to before.</span></p><p><span style="">Paht, paht! </span></p><p><span style="">When Jaemin clashed with the enemies in the front, Jaemin&#x2019;s hands accurately pierced through the neck of the Orcs. &#xA0;A vampire&apos;s sharp claws were being used like fine swords.</span></p><p><span style="">Ggoo-uh-uh! </span></p><p><span style="">While Jaemin used his overwhelming quickness to move all over the ground to cut the throats of the Orcs, Baek-jungdo charged in like a bulldozer. &#xA0;Everything that got in his way was broken.</span></p><p><span style="">Kwahng, kwahng! </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hue hue. &#xA0;Let&apos;s see who becomes tired first.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">With the addition of Blanka&apos;s Buffs on top of Baek-jungdo&apos;s Reinforcement ability, he was basically like a human made out of steel. </span></p><p><span style="">The exploit of the two men caused the casualty of the Orcs to rise steadily. &#xA0;However, the party was inevitably being pushed slowly deeper into the canyon. &#xA0;As the corpses start pile up to form a mountain, the horde&#x2019;s advance also slowed.</span></p><p><span style="">As they were moving farther into the canyon, Melody used her energy to put a blessing on Baek-jungdo. &#xA0;Jaemin sucked the blood out of a barely alive Orc he had dragged back with him.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;We are literally at a dead-end. &#xA0;What should we do?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Haesol took a peek behind, and she let out a voice full of worry. &#xA0;Once the corpses were pushed to the side, the battle would start again. &#xA0;Moreover, her Taming ability didn&apos;t work well against the Orcs. </span></p><p><span style="">If she focused all her concentration into her Taming ability, she&apos;ll be able to Tame a single Orc. &#xA0;However, that wouldn&apos;t be of any help to their plight. &#xA0;She had made the mistake of coming near a Colony where the Orcs had made their residence.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;If it comes to it, we&apos;ll just climb the cliff.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;The dragonflies in the sky won&apos;t leave us alone.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Still, there are less dragonflies than the orcs.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">One of the reasons why they had escaped to the canyon was the fact that the dragonflies had been attacking them from the sky. &#xA0;They looked like a bug, but they were as big as a helicopter. &#xA0;Moreover, they had spider-like legs that allowed them to snatch their prey. &#xA0;They grabbed their prey with their legs, and they munched on their prey as they flew.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hoo. &#xA0;I think I&apos;d rather face the Orcs.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">If they were caught by the dragonflies as they climbed the cliff...</span></p><p><span style="">The Orcs had moved the pile of corpses to the side, and they charged forward. &#xA0;It seems the Orcs thought this battle was almost at an end. &#xA0;It was overwhelming to see the black mass gathered in front of them. &#xA0;There were too many of them.</span></p><p><span style="">They had killed so many of them, yet more of them were pouring forth. &#xA0;It was a frightening sight.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hoo. &#xA0;Let&apos;s do this again.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Baek-jungdo&apos;s stoked his fighting spirit. &#xA0;As he was about to step forward, he narrowed his eyes.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What the hell is that?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Uh? Maybe hyung-nim is already back?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Jaemin also looked at the red fireball falling from the sky. &#xA0;If it wasn&#x2019;t some additional attack from the enemy, it was most definitely an ally. As the fireball approached closer, they could discern the shape of the fireball.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;I think it&apos;s Sunggoo hyung.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;It really is Mr. Sunggoo.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Baek-jungdo agreed with Jaemin&apos;s words.</span></p><p><span style="">Sunggoo was falling from the sky, and he dropped into midst of the Orc horde.</span></p><p><span style="">Kwah-ah-ahng! </span></p><p><span style="">Accompanying the loud sound of an explosion, fire exploded forth into the air. &#xA0;The shockwave cause the hot air to sweep over the canyon.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ooh-oohk.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;L...look at that.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Haesol had a shocked expression as she pointed towards the front.</span></p><p><span style="">Hwah-roo-roo-roo-rook! </span></p><p><span style="">The heat was filling the canyon, and the Orcs were screaming as they ran around in chaos.</span></p><p><span style="">Kwahng, kwah-kwahng! </span></p><p><span style="">The flame moved freely as Sunggoo moved his hands and feet. &#xA0;Everything in his surrounding was being burned. &#xA0;Che-haesol couldn&apos;t believe her eyes. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Mr Sunggoo is....&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">He had become unbelievably strong. Hong-sunggoo had looked like a dolt when they had went around clearing the Dungeons. &#xA0;Was this really him?</span></p><p><span style="">Hwah-roo-rook. </span></p><p><span style="">Sunggoo walked through the flames to approach the party. &#xA0;Jaemin ran forward in greeting.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Sunggoo hyung! What are you doing here?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hoo-ooh. &#xA0;What do you mean what am I doing here? &#xA0;Hyung-nim sent me ahead.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ah&#x2026;.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Sunggoo patted down his hair where a stray flame was burning his hair. Then he suddenly asked them a question.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I&apos;ve got some good news and some bad news.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;W...what is it?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Which one do you want to hear first?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I want the good news first.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I&#x2019;m incredibly strong now. &#xA0;I just learned how to fly through the air.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Do-jaemin&#x2019;s eyes was shining brightly. &#xA0;He couldn&#x2019;t believe a day would come where Hong-sunggoo looked so cool. </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Did you learn how to do it from the Lich you talked about before?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What&apos;s the bad news?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;The Lich is trying to kill me.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Sunggoo&apos;s face suddenly darkened. From a long distance away, a dark shape was flying towards them. &#xA0;The shadow of death was approaching.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Shit. I&#x2019;ll heave to head out first.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;W...what about us?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;You guys are coming with me.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;&#x2026;?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">It was a dead end. &#xA0;Where were they suppose to go? </span></p><p><span style="">Before they could ask the question, Sunggoo took in a deep breath. &#xA0;He ran past the fire, and he headed towards the exit of the canyon.</span></p><p><span style="">Ggwah-ah-ahng! </span></p><p><span style="">Flame erupted every time Sunggoo took a step. &#xA0;He used his enormous fire to create a narrow path.</span></p><p><span style="">The party ran after him as they watched the canyon turned into a complete pandemonium.</span></p>
