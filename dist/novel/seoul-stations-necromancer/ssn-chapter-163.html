<p><span style="">Chapter 163 - Bibi&apos;s Castle (2)&#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">KH hotel. </span></p><p><span style="">Only the people invited could enter the assembly hall, but the content of what they would be discussing wasn&apos;t a secret. </span></p><p><span style="">The main participant hosting this general assembly hadn&apos;t appeared yet.</span></p><p><span style="">The assembly hall was decorated like a dinner party, and everyone was having a conversation as they gathered into various groups. &#xA0;No one was paying attention to the food that was being laid out in a buffet style.</span></p><p><span style="">Everyone that had been invited were the best Roused that the world could offer. &#xA0;Moreover, the main figures of the guilds were all here. </span></p><p><span style="">This was a gathering hosted by Kahng-woojin. &#xA0;Some only needed this fact to move like migrating clouds to attend this meeting. &#xA0;The medium-sized guilds weren&apos;t even able to get a seat in this event.</span></p><p><span style="">They were dissatisfied, but they couldn&apos;t do anything about it.</span></p><p><span style="">Jung-minchan caught sight of a man with drooping shoulders within the crowd. &#xA0;Minchan smiled as he approached him.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Aigo. &#xA0;Is that you, president Park?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Hammer guild&apos;s president Park-sahngoh was about to drink his beverage, and it had gone down the wrong hole. &#xA0;He let out a cough.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hmm. &#xA0;Kmmm. &#xA0;Should I call you Prime Minister Jung now?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ha ha ha. &#xA0;Yes, I am Alandal&apos;s Prime Minister.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;&#x2026;.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">At one time, he had been the president to this former team leader, who had been in charge of a lower end support team. &#xA0;There was an awkward apprehension that was unfolding between them right now.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I heard you had a hard time trying to set up this general assembly.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&quot;It was ridiculous. &#xA0;Various guilds threatened me for an invite, and there were also terrorists that forewarned me of attacks. &#xA0;Then there was the requests for....&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">It seemed Park-sahngoh had a difficult time. &#xA0;There were dark circles under his eyes, and his skin looked dull. &#xA0;He looked to have aged significantly.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I guess we were unnecessarily demanding with our requests.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;No. &#xA0;I fully understand why those requests were made.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">It wasn&apos;t as if Minchan couldn&apos;t sympathize with Park-sahngoh&apos;s troubles.</span></p><p><span style="">This wasn&apos;t a birthday party. &#xA0;One couldn&apos;t just book a place, then send out the invitations. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">This meeting was being led by Kahng-woojin... </span></p><p><span style="">This general assembly was being done to disseminate more information about Alphen and the Dungeons.</span></p><p><span style="">Of course, the world&apos;s attention couldn&apos;t help, but be focused on this event. &#xA0;Countless people sent requests or threats to obtain an invitation to this general assembly. &#xA0;Park-sahngoh had to carefully plan out how they would be able to protect everyone. &#xA0;First, he had to do an exhaustive search on finding a building, then the security personnel....</span></p><p><span style="">As time continued to pass, the interest in this event grew proportionally. </span></p><p><span style="">There was so much factors to worry about that it had been hard to advance in his work.</span></p><p><span style="">Park-sahngoh had suffered under such conditions.</span></p><p><span style="">When the KH guild insisted on managing the general assembly, Park-sahngoh immediately shoved the responsibility to the KH guild as if he was attempting to blow away all the stress he was feeling.</span></p><p><span style="">The location of the general assembly was decided to be held at the KH hotel, and the new invitations were re-sent. &#xA0;Funnily enough, the new invitation was sent by e-mail.</span></p><p><span style="">The effort and preparations paid attention to by Park-sahngoh was all for naught with the change in venue. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">The KH guild was relaxed in their preparation.</span></p><p><span style="">The complaints and threats reached a fevered pitch, but KH guild and Alandal ignored it all.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Is this really going to be ok?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What do you mean?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Some guilds didn&apos;t receive personal invitations, so they took it as Alandal ignoring them....&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Our invitation was extended to every guild in this world.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;No. &#xA0;You guys only put up a post regarding that issue on an SNS post....&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;That should be enough.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;&#x2026;.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">They were dealing with the VIP Roused of this world.</span></p><p><span style="">One didn&apos;t need to look too far. &#xA0;Several large guilds in China had their pride hurt when they hadn&apos;t received an official invite, so they weren&apos;t attending this event. </span></p><p><span style="">Park-sahngoh thought about his past hardship, and these discontented guilds had caused a lot of friction.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;That&#x2019;s their choice.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ah&#x2026;.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Was this really the Jung-minchan he had known?</span></p><p><span style="">It was said the office makes the man. &#xA0;When did he develop such large balls?</span></p><p><span style="">At that moment, a stocky man approached them.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ah-oh. &#xA0;Prime minister Jung.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;President Baek..&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">KH guild&apos;s president Baek-jungdo approached as he massaged his shoulders.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I roughed it for so long that any amount of sleep won&#x2019;t recover my body.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Haha. &#xA0;You exaggerate too much. &#xA0;I heard you measured your rank again, and you were determine to be Rank AA. &#xA0;Congratulations.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Huh? Did the news already spread that far?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;There are article being poured out right now. &#xA0;How could I not know?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ooh-haha. &#xA0;That is true.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">When Baek-jungdo returned to his guild, he had remeasured his Rank. &#xA0;He wanted to check the result of his training. &#xA0;Unexpectedly, his Rank had turned out to have gone up to Rank AA.</span></p><p><span style="">If one didn&apos;t count Kahng-woojin, he would officially be the first Rank AA of Korea. </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Well, Jaemin will probably be measured to be Rank AA. &#xA0;Of course, the Holy Maiden is at least a Rank S. &#xA0;Don&apos;t you think Blanka and Haesol is also Rank AA?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;We haven&apos;t measured them yet, so it is all speculation at this point.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Koo-kook. &#xA0;Alandal is too humble. &#xA0;We don&apos;t even have to measure brother Sungggoo. &#xA0;I&apos;m sure he is at very least a Rank AA.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;&#x2026;.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Jung-minchan wordlessly smiled. &#xA0;Hong-sunggoo&apos;s growth speed was the best in this world. </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Of course, it is contingent on him coming back alive. &#xA0;Hahaha..&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;&#x2026;.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Jung-minchan couldn&apos;t just laugh at Baek-jungdo&apos;s joke.</span></p><p><span style="">Park-sahngoh&apos;s eyes widened in surprise as he listened to their conversation.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;All the Roused of Alandal is at such levels?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Huh? I guess president Park doesn&apos;t know much about it. &#xA0;Even the new recruits they just picked up looked pretty good.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Huh&#x2026;.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Was Alandal some kind of factory that churned out monsters?</span></p><p><span style="">How are they able to scout all these geniuses?</span></p><p><span style="">Park-ahngoh eyed Jung-minchan. &#xA0;When he was with Hammer guild, team leader Jung-minchan had a knack for unearthing talented individuals.</span></p><p><span style="">Now he had moved guilds, and he had started out as the vice president. &#xA0;However, he had risen to help found a nation, and he had become the Prime minister of this said nation.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Koo. &#xA0;I shouldn&#x2019;t have let him slip away.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">He should have held onto him.</span></p><p><span style="">He should have listened and given full support to Minchan. &#xA0;However, it was too late to regret it.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ah. &#xA0;It seems the president has arrived.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">The entrance became crowded, and the flashes caused by the cameras could be seen. &#xA0;Jung-minchan headed towards that direction. &#xA0;All the people in the hall focused their attention on the entrance.</span></p><p><span style="">Minchan saw Woo-soonghoon hanging around near the entrance, so he asked Soonghoon a question.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Where did the president go?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I directed him to the ready room. &#xA0;He said for you to hurry up, and prepare everything.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Kmmm. &#xA0;Have you prepared the data?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;We&apos;ve been thorough in our preparation.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;All right. Let&apos;s hurry up and go.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">There was still one hour left until the appointed time, so why did they have to be so urgent.... &#xA0;&#xA0;The two headed towards the ready room. &#xA0;Soon, an announcement was heard informing everyone about the start of the general assembly.</span></p><p><span style="">*** </span></p><p><span style="">The room was reminiscent of a large lecture hall at a college. &#xA0;People were packed into the seats. &#xA0;Even if it was uncomfortable, no one complained.</span></p><p><span style="">Some of the guilds here were already aware of the information that was about to be discussed here.</span></p><p><span style="">The people, who knew this information, had kept it a secret. &#xA0;However, Kahng-woojin would be revealing everything to the world. &#xA0;There was no way to predict what kind of ripple it would cause.</span></p><p><span style="">The cameras were running, and it was being live broadcasted to the world. &#xA0;Jung-minchan ascended the stage.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;My name is Jung-minchan. &#xA0;I am the Prime Minister of Alandal.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">He had put on a relaxed smile on his face, but he was shaking inside.</span></p><p><span style="">His mother could have never expected this. &#xA0;She probably never expected him to rise to a position where the world would pay attention to him.</span></p><p><span style="">Jung-minchan had wanted to be successful, but his ambition hadn&apos;t been this large. &#xA0;However, things somehow turned out like this after he had met Kahng-woojin. </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Before the king gets up here, I&apos;ll go over a summary of the information we were able to find out about the Dungeons.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Minchan put the power point he readied on the screen.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Trahnet. &#xA0;This word has entered our sphere of consciousness not too long ago. &#xA0;It was first used by Alandal&apos;s king. &#xA0;It was introduced by Kahng-woojin-nim.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">The word, &quot;Trahnet&quot; appeared on screen, then planets started to form around it.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;We look at it as a network between planets. &#xA0;Roads are constantly being made.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">The screen changed.</span></p><p><span style="">It was a picture of the monsters that appeared in the last worldwide Break. &#xA0;It especially highlighted the Dragon that seemed to be wrapped around an enormous tree as if it was protecting it.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;The Dimensional lords use these roads to invade. &#xA0;They are also called the Monster Lords. &#xA0;The monsters are their troops.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Then the pictures of the subway stations appeared next.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;The Dimensional lords each have their own separate Dimensional Domain. &#xA0;This is what we call the high rank Dungeons. &#xA0;These Dungeons are like gateways. However, they cannot open all the doors to come to earth.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Afterwards, the screen changed, and the picture of a green gem appeared.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;If the Dungeon is a gateway, then the Return Stone is comparable to a key. &#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">A successful clear created a Mine and a failure created a Break.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Currently, thirty days are needed for synchronization. &#xA0;If no one is able to take away this key, they are able to open this gateway. &#xA0;This is called the Dungeon Break. &#xA0;If one is able to steal the key, the monsters would haunt the Dungeon until the Energy is all used up. &#xA0;It&apos;ll turn into a Mine.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Someone quickly raised their hand high into the air.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;How do you explain the Dungeons that Broke even though the requisite 30 days hadn&apos;t passed?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;The information regarding that issue will come out right after this.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Jung-minchan moved onto the next slide.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Basically, the owner of the house had opened the door. &#xA0;A person from earth opened the door. Our king deterred the ex-Hwarang guild&apos;s president Lee-sahngho. &#xA0;He was the root cause.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">The screen changed again. &#xA0;It was footages of when Kahng-woojin had visited the US. &#xA0;It showed the missile terrorist attack and the Iron Golem Dolsae fighting the monsters.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;This place had been a test site. &#xA0;It was the first time a Dungeon was formed outside of a subway station. &#xA0;These experiments had been conducted by the Rivers organization and Professor Riola. &#xA0;As you can see, they had succeeded.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">This had moved beyond just defending the subway stations now.</span></p><p><span style="">What could they do? &#xA0;The sense of crisis pressed down heavily on the assembly hall.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Now we will hear from Alandal&apos;s king.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">No one directed it, but everyone got up from their seat when Woojin appeared. &#xA0;It felt as if he was getting up to give a lecture. &#xA0;He didn&apos;t show his pleasure or displeasure regarding this situation.</span></p><p><span style="">He had a nonchalant reaction as if he had expected such a reception.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Everyone should sit. &#xA0;Everyone should know who I am, so I won&apos;t introduce myself again. &#xA0;I&apos;ll just deliver my message.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Woojin took out a purple colored gem from his possession. &#xA0;It was letting out a bright light, and massive amount of energy was being emitted by it.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;In the recent fracas, didn&apos;t some countries pick this up? &#xA0;Britain also bought one from me.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Currently, research was going on in many quarters of the world. &#xA0;Woojin had put this secret information out in the open. &#xA0;He spoke about topics and Items that was potentially worth billions...no, trillions of dollars.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;If you can gather three of these, you&apos;ll have the qualification to become a Dimensional lord. Moreover, you can gain a Dungeon if you use one of these.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Someone got impatient, and this person raised his hand as he spoke.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Then Kahng-woojin-nim is also a Dimensional lord?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Of course.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;&#x2026;.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">The assembly hall stirred.</span></p><p><span style="">Moreover, the general atmosphere indicated that they had come to an understanding. &#xA0;They assumed Kahng-woojin&#x2019;s inexplicable amount of personal power wasn&apos;t all his own.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Aren&apos;t you being very shameless? &#xA0;You sat on something that is so profitable?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Woojin turned to look at him?</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Profit?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">He grinned.</span></p><p><span style="">If seizing power was a form of profit, Woojin was enjoying the benefit of his actions. &#xA0;However, it was also true that he had much more responsibility, because of it.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Why don&apos;t you go find one for yourself then?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;&#x2026;.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">It was a bit cheeky to say what Woojin had said, but it made the person sit back down. &#xA0;Jung-minchan couldn&apos;t help, but let out a laugh. It was a very Kahng-woojin-like answer.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;The important part is the fact that the road to earth is open now. &#xA0;The invasion attempts will continue. This isn&apos;t about profit for me. &#xA0;Why would I be telling all of this to everyone if that was my aim?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">There was a hubbub.</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin continued to speak as a buzz was building amongst the crowd.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I want to protect my family. &#xA0;On a smaller note, I want to protect earth. &#xA0;The fact that I protect the earth is secondary. &#xA0;The safety of my family is my primary goal.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Ah. &#xA0;Isn&apos;t that supposed to be the other way around? </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Is there a way to do it?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;There is.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Kahng-woojin spoke confidently.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I bought an aircraft carrier. &#xA0;I&apos;ll put my family on it, and I&apos;ll protect it.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">At Woojin&apos;s words, someone mumbled, &apos;Noah&apos;s Ark&apos;, under their breath.</span></p><p><span style="">The atmosphere inside the assembly hall turned a little sharp. &#xA0;The change in the general mood darkened Jung-minchan&apos;s face.</span></p><p><span style="">It wasn&apos;t evil for a man in power to be hypocritical. &#xA0;Maybe Kahng-woojin was too honest....</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Are you saying you&apos;ll only save yourself?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;No, this is a warning. &#xA0;My enemies aren&apos;t all located in different dimensions.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">It was a warning.</span></p><p><span style="">Kahng-woojin, the greatest Roused of this world, revealed what was most important to him... &#xA0;He said he would put his family above all else. &#xA0;He was telling everyone not to mess with them. </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I don&apos;t want to unnecessarily ramble on after calling all of you here. &#xA0;This is what I what I wanted to tell all of you.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Kahng-woojin looked at his stirring audience, and he spoke.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What can we do when the enemies are gathering here?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Was there a solution? &#xA0;No. &#xA0;They weren&#x2019;t all gathered here, because the solution was known.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;We can lessen the number of roads connecting to our place. Then we can all fight against the enemies together.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Currently, he was telling them the obvious.</span></p><p><span style="">This wasn&apos;t anything ground breaking. &#xA0;It was the stock answer.</span></p><p><span style="">Currently, they were doing all they could do decrease the links to the Dungeons. &#xA0;The unavoidable Dungeon Breaks were blocked using a combined force.</span></p><p><span style="">The only thing different in this proposal was his plan to unite the world.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;You already have a method that&apos;ll ensure your own survival. &#xA0;Do you want us to act as meat shields for the bullets?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Someone yelled out in anger. &#xA0;Woojin smirked at those words.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;No way.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Woojin boldly let out a shout.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I&apos;ll be leading the vanguard.&#x201D;</span></p>
