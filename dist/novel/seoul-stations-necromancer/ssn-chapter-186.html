<p>Chapter 186 - Last Holy Item (2)</p><p><span style="">Were the gods always right?</span></p><p><span style="">When she had this conflicting thought, the feeling of anguish arose.</span></p><p><span style="">This matter was such a big deal that it shook her to the core.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Ha-ah.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Even if she kept worrying over the problem, the only thing she could do was sigh.</span></p><p><span style="">Her goddess wanted her to set it on fire...</span></p><p><span style="">Why did her goddess give her such an oracle?</span></p><p><span style="">Was she trying to prevent Kahng-woojin from returning to earth? &#xA0;Or was she trying to oppose him?</span></p><p><span style="">She couldn&apos;t discern the meaning behind the oracle, so Melody was tormented.</span></p><p><span style="">This was the first time she had this feeling of doubt in her life.</span></p><p><span style="">She had always considered the goddess&apos; words to be always right, and she always followed it.</span></p><p><span style="">Was she the Holy Maiden of the goddess of premonition, or was she just a puppet on a string....</span></p><p><span style="">Melody stood still for awhile as she looked at the World Tree.</span></p><p><span style="">Her expression kept changing by the minute, and she finally shook her head.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;This isn&apos;t right.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">What was the meaning behind burning the World Tree?</span></p><p><span style="">The Dungeon, &apos;Raht&apos;s Temple&apos;, was cleared by Celrak, so Kahng-woojin only had the Saurus Colony left.</span></p><p><span style="">If she burned the World Tree, which was his Symbol, the connection point between earth and Alphen would be severed.</span></p><p><span style="">Moreover, she didn&apos;t have the confidence that she&#x2019;ll be able to endure the Immortal&apos;s wrath when he learned of her action. &#xA0;The Gate was needed for him to return to earth.</span></p><p><span style="">No matter how much she thought about it, she couldn&apos;t come to the conclusion that the act of burning the World Tree was for the betterment of earth and Alphen.</span></p><p><span style="">For the first time in Melody&apos;s life, she made her own decision instead of following the voice of her goddess.</span></p><p><span style="">Moreover...</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I can&apos;t do it.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">The ramification of her choice wasn&apos;t small.</span></p><p><span style="">Shooooooo.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Ah ah...&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Is this what divine punishment felt like?</span></p><p><span style="">It felt as if the soul within her head was being shaken at its roots.</span></p><p><span style="">This was different from the sensation of pain. &#xA0;She felt her body be seized by a sense of futility and powerlessness.</span></p><p><span style="">It felt as if an something important was draining out of her. &#xA0;When the feeling subsided, she immediately realized what was missing.</span></p><p><span style="">It was a power she had always lived with. &#xA0;It was a power she knew very intimately.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I turned my back on the goddess...&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">She couldn&apos;t feel her Holy Power.</span></p><p><span style="">She feebly looked at her two hands. &#xA0;Her goddess hadn&apos;t abandoned her, since she had abandoned her goddess first...</span></p><p><span style="">She actually felt grateful for the retraction of her Holy Power.</span></p><p><span style="">She had received a punishment. &#xA0;This lessened some of the guilt she felt for going against the will of her goddess.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;It is done.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Now the Immortal wouldn&apos;t lose his way back home. &#xA0;Her goddess&apos; oracle was incorrect. &#xA0;No, Melody had made it so.</span></p><p><span style="">Since Kahng-woojin could still travel back and forth from earth, he won&#x2019;t lose that important something within himself.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Ha-ah.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">She fell to her knees, and she looked up at the World Tree.</span></p><p><span style="">The wind blew against the leaves, and the leaves moved like a wave. &#xA0;It felt as if the tree was trying to console her.</span></p><p><span style="">It was the same for swaying flame of Sunggoo below...</span></p><p><span style="">Zeeeeng.</span></p><p><span style="">At that moment, the Portal let out a light as a person appeared.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Immort...&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Melody thought the Immortal had returned, so she had stood up to greet him. &#xA0;However, someone else exited from Portal. &#xA0;It wasn&apos;t just a single person. &#xA0;It was several people.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Hoo-ooh. &#xA0;Is this place Alphen?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">The Holy Maiden approached them.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Who are you?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Ah. &#xA0;You are the Holy Maiden. &#xA0;I saw you in a forum in New York. &#xA0;My name is Nakamura.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Ah...&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">She remembered him.</span></p><p><span style="">She had gathered the earth&apos;s Roused to ask of them to save Alphen. &#xA0;She asked for an expedition force to be formed, but the Daken guild from Japan fought against the idea. &#xA0;They had argued in terms of profitability of such a venture.</span></p><p><span style="">However, with the appearance of Kahng-woojin, the plans for the expedition group dissolved into thin air. &#xA0;All plans were scrapped. &#xA0;This was what she remembered...</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;It seems the cleanup party is here.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Yes. &#xA0;We are the cleanup party from earth. &#xA0;We are here to help rebuild Alphen.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Nakamura displayed his white teeth as he laughed.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;My name is Masuro Nakamura. &#xA0;I am in charged of the expedition group sent from the Daken guild.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">She shook his hand in the confusion of the moment, and she felt a weird sense of danger. &#xA0;Even if she didn&apos;t have the blessing from the goddess of premonition, her instincts told her to be wary of this man.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;We are the first wave of the cleanup party. &#xA0;Soon, there will be a second and third group from earth crossing over to Alphen.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;...this is good news.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Wasn&apos;t this what she always wanted? &#xA0;The Roused from earth would be coming over to fight for Alphen, so how could she not thank them?</span></p><p><span style="">However, something was bothering her. &#xA0;It was the greasy light within their eyes.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Could you explain the lay of the land right now?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;This region had already been swept by the Immortal&apos;s army, so there should be no forces left that could pose a threat to us. &#xA0;However...&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Melody held back what she was about to say. &#xA0;She hesitated before she continued speaking.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;You should talk to the heroes of the Coalition.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Ah... We will. &#xA0;I forgot there were heroes here. &#xA0;So they are S Rank Roused...&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Nakamura turned to look behind him.</span></p><p><span style="">He had come with an elite force that was an equal of 100 warriors. &#xA0;Moreover, he brought a research staff, who&apos;ll study Alphen.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Well, shall we start restoring Alphen?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">The Japanese from the Daken Guild, who had crossed over to Alphen, quickly started to explore their surrounding.</span></p><p><span style="">***</span></p><p><span style="">[Beeep. &#xA0;A variable outside of the prediction simulation has occurred.]</span></p><p><span style="">The speaker, which had been frustratingly giving the same answer over and over again, broke from its patter. &#xA0;It spoke something different. &#xA0;Woojin frowned.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;What nonsense are you talking about?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Chee-jee-jeek.</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin&apos;s body was soaked with sweat from smashing the monitors.</span></p><p><span style="">The god of Time was tireless, but a human got easily tired.</span></p><p><span style="">[A change that varies from the record has occurred. &#xA0;A new branch point has started.]</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;....&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin&apos;s face crumpled.</span></p><p><span style="">He didn&apos;t care if they were gods or some other form of life. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">What were they? &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">There were a lot of questions yet to be answered, but he was sure of one thing.</span></p><p><span style="">It was useless to reason with them. &#xA0;They only spat out words that they wanted to say.</span></p><p><span style="">They were unfriendly, and he had no idea what their aims were.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;So what is that supposed to mean!&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">[It is time.]</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;....&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Psssh.</span></p><p><span style="">The sound of air escaping was heard, and a hatch from the ceiling opened. &#xA0;Something akin to an elevator descended. &#xA0;It was too small for a person to ride on it. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">The very small space above the lift was encased in glass, and one could see what was inside.</span></p><p><span style="">The item was treated like a relic being displayed in a museum.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Heres&apos; Belt.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">[I&apos;m giving you the last key.]</span></p><p><span style="">Pshhhhh.</span></p><p><span style="">The glass window opened, and Heres&apos; Holy Item was within it.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;....&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">What was the reason behind this move?</span></p><p><span style="">There was a causal relationship for everything. &#xA0;It might seem like a coincidence, but if one looked back an incident, one could always find out what had caused it. &#xA0;If Heres was giving up the Holy Item so easily, why did it waste his time like this?</span></p><p><span style="">Even as he made a mess of its temple, Heres hadn&#x2019;t stop him. &#xA0;It had been frustrating experience. &#xA0;It kept repeating it wasn&apos;t time yet. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">So why did the situation suddenly change?</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Let me ask you one question.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">[This is the start of a new branch, so I have no data. &#xA0;I just record. &#xA0;Prediction is not my speciality.]</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;....&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">He wanted to beat the hell out of the bald man behind the monitor. &#xA0;He was so detestable that Woojin would automatically hit the man if he showed up.</span></p><p><span style="">Who the hell said he wanted to know about the future?</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Well, it isn&apos;t as if you answered my question when I asked about old events.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">[True.]</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Are you playing with...&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">[I cannot tell you about how the variable would affect you. &#xA0;I just record. &#xA0;I will not cause changes to your journey.]</span></p><p><span style="">Instead of stoking his anger, the god of Time Heres&apos; words made Woojin give up. It had been giving such shameless answers for the past several hours.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I think you&apos;ve done enough to change what I&apos;m going to do.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">[....]</span></p><p><span style="">It was silent again.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Uh-whew. &#xA0;Forget I said that.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin grabbed Heres&apos; Belt.</span></p><p><span style="">He had gathered all 5 Items he would need to make Thrash&apos;s armor set. &#xA0;The rest of the ingredients could be bought through the Dimensional Store or it could be gathered at a different location. &#xA0;He didn&apos;t have to be tied down to Alphen anymore.</span></p><p><span style="">It was time to return to earth.</span></p><p><span style="">When he acquired the Holy Item, the door opened once again, and the long corridor was revealed. &#xA0;He started to slowly walk out of the room, and Latasha, who had been waiting in the corner, suddenly appeared next him.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Let&apos;s go.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;...&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Latasha looked at the Immortal face with a dumbfounded expression. &#xA0;How could a man, who had gone complete bat shit crazy for several hours, suddenly speak like this.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Shouldn&apos;t you resolve some of your issues before you go?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;What do you mean?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;You have a lot of questions.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Even if I ask them, it won&apos;t answer me. &#xA0;What can I do?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;....&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">He answered in such a dignified manner that she didn&apos;t know what to say. &#xA0;Latasha&apos;s own experiences didn&apos;t prepare her for making sense of the Immortal&apos;s action. She couldn&apos;t help, but ask him another question. </span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Didn&apos;t you destroy his possessions to get an answer?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I did it just in case. &#xA0;Also, I would have been bored if I had to just wait doing nothing.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;....&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">As expected, the Immortal was born with a propensity for violence.</span></p><p><span style="">Latasha once again had to reevaulate Kahng-woojin.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I&apos;ve got everything I came here for.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">He hadn&apos;t come here to talk to Heres. &#xA0;He just wanted to acquire the Holy Item.</span></p><p><span style="">He had thought he would be able to find an answer to his stifling situation, yet it felt as if everything had become more complicated.</span></p><p><span style="">However, Kahng-woojin was too thick-skinned to worry too much over it. &#xA0;He wasn&apos;t overly stressed.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Let&apos;s hurry back.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Yes...&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">He was just annoyed with Heres&apos; unnecessary actions.</span></p><p><span style="">Elf Lord Latasha quickly got on behind Woojin.</span></p><p><span style="">Chee-jee-jeek.</span></p><p><span style="">The bald man appeared on all the screens except for the broken ones.</span></p><p><span style="">[I hope you will be able to complete your journey this time....]</span></p><p><span style="">[Chee-jee-jeek. &#xA0;Kahng-woojin....]</span></p><p><span style="">Heres&apos; voice sounded too earnest for it to be called a sound made by a machine.</span></p><p><span style="">***</span></p><p><span style="">Phantom Unit.</span></p><p><span style="">They were talents found through an open call...</span></p><p><span style="">Actually, these were the people, who hadn&#x2019;t been able to run away, when Kahng-woojin and Kim-kahngchul suddenly got into a fight. &#xA0;They had all been low Rank Roused, but that wasn&apos;t the case any more.</span></p><p><span style="">Rank B.</span></p><p><span style="">The lowest ranked member of the Phantom Unit was Rank B.</span></p><p><span style="">It was a high rank where they would be able to be hired as a director in most guilds.</span></p><p><span style="">It had been only several months, yet they had grown at a breakneck pace. &#xA0;It was inexplicable to everyone else as to how this was possible. &#xA0;However, Alandal was known for growing unbelievably strong Roused, so it wasn&apos;t something that happened only in a dream.</span></p><p><span style="">The Reinforcement Stones were used to increase the base stats, and Alandal hadn&apos;t skimped on investing numerous Skill Book into them. &#xA0;They had been only Rank E and F, yet they were given all these stuff.</span></p><p><span style="">Che-haesol had become the leader of this newly made Phantom Unit. &#xA0;It was thanks to her that the members of the Phantom Unit were well trained, and loyal.</span></p><p><span style="">Still, they were weaker than the Undead Army, so they were given the role of rescuing members of the Coalition. &#xA0;They were here to help the Coalition rebuild.</span></p><p><span style="">There were a lot of work to do at the Saurus Colony, but... &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">In recent days, they&apos;ve run across a lot of trouble.</span></p><p><span style="">They weren&apos;t in dispute with the people of this planet, beings from different races or even the forces of the Coalition. &#xA0;The problem arose from the people, who had originated from the same place as them. &#xA0;The people from earth were causing problems.</span></p><p><span style="">One of the top members of the Phantom Unit named Kim-joonyong looked at the people from the Daken guild. &#xA0;He looked at them with disapproval in his eyes.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Who the hell are they? &#xA0;What kind of soldier looks like that?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;They aren&apos;t soldiers.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;What are they?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;They are researcher.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;....so why would researchers come here when we have to reclaim Alphen?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Well...they are here to research?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Uh-whew. &#xA0;They are here to research what?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;How the hell should I know?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;....&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">He didn&apos;t know about it, so how would other members of his unit know about it? &#xA0;He was being silly. &#xA0;He let out an awkward cough at his fellow member, who had gotten angry. &#xA0;Then Kim-joonyong started walking forward.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Uh? Where are you going?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I&apos;m the one, who is frustrated, so I&apos;ll be the one digging the well.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;What?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I&apos;m curious, so I&apos;ll just go ask them.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">He was an inherently curious man. &#xA0;When Kim-joonyong was curious about something, he wouldn&apos;t be satisfied until he could ask and solve the question.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Excuse me.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;...&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">The researchers of the Daken guild looked at the man, who had suddenly shown up, with suspicious gazes. &#xA0;They looked at each other.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;What is it?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;What are you researching?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;...we are looking at the lay of the land.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">That was something he already knew even if the other man hadn&apos;t said it. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">As a basic rule, the portal didn&apos;t allow items from earth to pass through it.</span></p><p><span style="">This was why the researchers had made a strange looking stethoscope, which used Blood Stones as an energy source. &#xA0;They were using this device to poke around the ground in various locations.</span></p><p><span style="">This was why he was curious about it.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Why?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;How else are we going to build a sturdy castle?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;But we already have a castle?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;...&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">The Saurus mountain already had castle walls as part of being a Colony.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Ah, jeez. &#xA0;Why do you have to be so nosy? &#xA0;They just told me to conduct a search up here, so I&apos;m searching.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Oh well.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Since the other man got angry, it felt awkward, so Joonyong retreated. &#xA0;When Joonyong had moved away, the researchers of the Daken guild looked around before they whispered to each other.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Do they suspect what we are doing?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;No way. &#xA0;If they knew what we are trying to do, they would have shown some signs.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Hmm. &#xA0;Anyways, the amount of oil deposit below ground is much more than imagined. &#xA0;We might need help from the US.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;That&apos;s good news. &#xA0;They usually don&#x2019;t move easily. &#xA0;We&apos;ll bring in help from the US and several other guilds.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Hoo hoo. We were fortunate that our guild was chosen as the first group.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Why wouldn&apos;t we be fortunate? &#xA0;This is his Majesty the Emperor&apos;s favor. &#xA0;It is telling us to once again seek the glory of our empire.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I want you record all the data carefully.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">The researchers busily found the locations of underground natural resources, and they organized the information.</span></p><p><span style="">The faction pining for Japanese Imperialism reared its head again.</span></p><p><span style="">They had traveled through the portal to a planet called Alphen. &#xA0;They would use helping Alphen&apos;s Coalition as pretext...</span></p>
