<p>Chapter 181 - Bone Dragon (1)</p><p><span style="">&quot;You want me to become a god?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Celrak raised his eyebrows when Woojin answered with a question. &#xA0;The Immortal was a stubborn being that was incapable of being controlled by others. &#xA0;Was the Immortal really being persuaded by him?</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Yes! &#xA0;Instead of allowing others to steal your home planet, wouldn&apos;t it be better if you protect it this way?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">He would be protecting it.</span></p><p><span style="">Or should it really be considered protecting his home planet? &#xA0;He would rule over earth rather than letting someone else rule over it....</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I guess I can see why you think we are gods.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;What are you saying? &#xA0;Will you really agree to stop this war?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Celrak put on a slightly hopeful expression. &#xA0;Woojin&apos;s laughter deepened when he saw this.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;A retard is talking about retarded things.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;....&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Come at me, retard.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Celrak&apos;s eyebrows twitched.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Eeee... How dare you.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Celrak raged as the back of his shoulders exploded. &#xA0;Wings erupted from his back as it kept getting larger. &#xA0;The wings unfurled, and it was over 10 meters in size.</span></p><p><span style="">Too-dook, too-toohk.</span></p><p><span style="">The wings weren&apos;t the only parts that got bigger. &#xA0;It was as if Celrak&apos;s body was trying to grow in proportion with the large wings. &#xA0;His body steadily grew, and it was three times larger than a normal person&apos;s body.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;How dare you order me around!&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">The angered Celrak moved his feet.</span></p><p><span style="">Kooooooong.</span></p><p><span style="">The ground shook as clouds of dust rose into the air.</span></p><p><span style="">The army organized formation showed signs of charging too.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;You are striving for something useless. &#xA0;Your era will never come to pass.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">The god of Destruction... &#xA0;This bastard was mad as a hatter.</span></p><p><span style="">Chwahhhhng.</span></p><p><span style="">When Celrak extended his hand in mid-air, his weapon appeared. &#xA0;It was a spear containing the power of lightning. &#xA0;The white electricity crawled over the spear as it let out a menacing sound.</span></p><p><span style="">Pah-jee-jeek.</span></p><p><span style="">Celrak saw a small needle in front of his eyes.</span></p><p><span style="">Shwahhng, pah-chee-jeek!</span></p><p><span style="">He reflexively swung his Thunder Spear, and something bounced off of it. &#xA0;It was a Bone Spear thrown by Woojin.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Bastard!&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">His chest voice exploded forth as he folded his wings.</span></p><p><span style="">Koong, koo-oohng!</span></p><p><span style="">It was as big as a Titan, yet it was as fast as an Elf.</span></p><p><span style="">Amongst Trahnet&apos;s great lords, he was one of the top ranked lords in terms of battle capabilities. &#xA0;Moreover, Celrak had fought the Immortal thrice in the past, and there had been no victors in any of those fights.</span></p><p><span style="">Their battles always resulted in both sides wasting their resources.</span></p><p><span style="">The Immortal brought back the monsters he killed, and the Dimensional lords wasted all their Points by replenishing their armies with new troops.</span></p><p><span style="">This was why it was important to kill the Immortal before he could turn the tables.</span></p><p><span style="">Celrak never joined a fight where there would be no gain for him.</span></p><p><span style="">However, he now had a reason to kill this bastard even at the cost of losing Points.</span></p><p><span style="">If he used his Points freely, there was no reason why he wouldn&apos;t be able to win against this bastard.</span></p><p><span style="">The Undead army would be able to continuously add to their ranks, so it would be a fight of wills. &#xA0;However, it wasn&apos;t as if the Immortal was all powerful.</span></p><p><span style="">Since Celrak had come here with tens of thousands of monsters, his army would occupy the Undead army. &#xA0;While they fought, Celrak just had to kill the Immortal.</span></p><p><span style="">The Immortal was the summoner, and if he was killed, the Undeads were easy preys.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I&apos;ll show you my full power!&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">This wasn&#x2019;t a battle where he had to weigh the advantages and disadvantages to change strategy.</span></p><p><span style="">He had to pour everything he had into this fight, and he had to tear the Immortal into pieces.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;It is too late for you to run away!&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;What did you say, retard?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;...!&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Kahng-woojin had suddenly appeared next to his ear, and Celrak was barely able to block the sword strike by swinging his Thunder Spear.</span></p><p><span style="">Pah-jee-jeek!</span></p><p><span style="">The electric sparks flew into the air, and it spread in a threatening manner.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Bastard!&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Celrak quickly found him again, but the Immortal had already planted his sword within Celrak&#x2019;s leg.</span></p><p><span style="">Kwah-jeek!</span></p><p><span style="">Was he always this fast?</span></p><p><span style="">Goo-uh-uh.</span></p><p><span style="">The corpses strewn across the ground suddenly stood up. &#xA0;They ran towards Celrak, and they grabbed onto both his legs.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;How dare these insignificant Undeads attack me!&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Hoo-ooh-ooh-oohng!</span></p><p><span style="">Celrak unfurled his large wings, and he rose into the sky. &#xA0;He tried to shake off the Undeads clinging to his legs, but unfortunately, the explosions occurred before he could act.</span></p><p><span style="">Ggoo-ahhhng!</span></p><p><span style="">The walking corpse zombies started to explode, and Celrak&#x2019;s legs disappeared. There was nothing left behind.</span></p><p><span style="">Shwahhng!</span></p><p><span style="">A light arrow pierced through his wing. &#xA0;Celrak flailed around before he plummeted to the ground.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Koo-oohk.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">What a shameful scene!</span></p><p><span style="">If only he had the Alphen&apos;s Master Code....</span></p><p><span style="">He&apos;ll be able to immediately regenerate such minor wounds. &#xA0;He could shape and mold everything within this planet.</span></p><p><span style="">Kahng-woojin walked to the head of the fallen Celrak. &#xA0;The Warrior&apos;s Weapon in his hand turned into an axe.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;You&apos;ll be able to see the world in half now.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;...&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Celrak glared at him when Woojin raised his axe.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;You bastard. &#xA0;Have you been hiding your power?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">No matter how he saw it, this wasn&apos;t the movements of a Necromancer. &#xA0;Was he a warrior?</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin grinned.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Retard.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Kwah-jeek!</span></p><p><span style="">The axe fell, and it split Celrak&apos;s head into two. &#xA0;His body turned into gray light. &#xA0;Celrak was dead, but his tens of thousand underlings still remained.</span></p><p><span style="">Their commander was dead, yet the monsters weren&apos;t flustered. &#xA0;They didn&apos;t run away. &#xA0;Instead, they charged towards Woojin, and they were full of killing intent.</span></p><p><span style="">This was why Dimensional lords used monsters as underlings. &#xA0;If they had orders, they fearlessly charged their enemies. &#xA0;Woojin welcomed this sight.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Come, my sacrifices.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">The day when all his Familiars would be able to gather in a single location wasn&apos;t too far off.</span></p><p><span style="">****</span></p><p><span style="">Kwah-kwah-kwahng!</span></p><p><span style="">After shooting several dozen fireballs, Sunggoo came down from the Amplifier.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Oo-oohk.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">He couldn&apos;t find his balance, so he swayed on his feet. &#xA0;Do-jaemin quickly helped Sunggoo stay upright.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Hyung. &#xA0;Are you ok?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Yes.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Sunggoo didn&apos;t look ok, but he tried hard to put on a smile for Jaemin.</span></p><p><span style="">Graham looked surprised when he saw the pale-faced Sunggoo.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Please calm your magical energy.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;What?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Your magical energy might go on a rampage. &#xA0;Please hurry up and come here!&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Sunggoo was helped by Graham, and he started stabilizing his magical energy. &#xA0;He calmly sat as he tried to calm his insides. &#xA0;Graham clicked his tongue.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Tsk. &#xA0;I already know you aren&apos;t a Spirit King.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;...?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">That fact was so obvious that Sunggoo didn&apos;t know what to say.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I&apos;m really curious as to who taught you about magic.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Should he say he learned it from Woojin? &#xA0;Or should he say he learned it through books, since he obtained the skills through magic scrolls....</span></p><p><span style="">Sunggoo was thinking about what he should say when Graham kept berating him in a dignified manner.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;That person has no right to call himself a magician. &#xA0;You have to harmonize your magic, yet your teacher taught you to focus only on fire. If your equilibrium falters a little bit, your body will be burned into ashes.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Uh...mmmm.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">How should he answer such a speech?</span></p><p><span style="">Should he say he was self-taught? &#xA0;Or maybe he should tell Graham about his Lich teacher, who deserved to be cussed at? </span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I believe you should be fine now. &#xA0;You should use your magic recovery technique as you bolster your weakened body.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Ah. &#xA0;Thank you.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">When Sunggoo bowed towards him, Graham shook his head.</span></p><p><span style="">This man had the potential to become an Archmage, yet he was an incomplete mage only capable of producing fire.</span></p><p><span style="">It was too bad.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;So who is your teacher? &#xA0;Do all magicians on earth use magic like you?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Ah... &#xA0;The person I call my teacher is from Alphen.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Huh? &#xA0;Who is he? &#xA0;I really want to question him immediately.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Graham became surprised, and he started showing his gallant spirit. &#xA0;Sunggoo let out an awkward laugh.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Haha. &#xA0;He said his name is Jaenis... &#xA0;However, he is already dead.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">At Sunggoo&apos;s words, Graham put on an embarrassed expression as he let out a fake cough.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Hrmm hrrm. &#xA0;My regret at your situation made me badmouth the deceased. &#xA0;I&apos;m sorry.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;It&apos;s ok. &#xA0;I&apos;ll introduce you to him soon.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;....&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">How was he suppose receive such words?</span></p><p><span style="">He said he&apos;ll make Graham meet a deceased person. &#xA0;Was Sunggoo saying he&apos;ll kill Graham?</span></p><p><span style="">Graham wasn&apos;t sure if it was a &apos;joke&apos; or a &apos;forewarning of an assassination&apos;. &#xA0;Graham had an odd expression on his face when he heard Sunggoo&apos;s words.</span></p><p><span style="">He was akin to a fire spirit, yet he was strangely a half a mage. &#xA0;What should he do with this magician from earth?</span></p><p><span style="">While Graham was thinking over what to do, Do-jaemin let out a shout.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;He&apos;s here! &#xA0;Hyung-nim is here.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Huh? &#xA0;Where?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Energy suddenly welled up from his dry reserves. &#xA0;Sunggoo abruptly got up to look for Woojin.</span></p><p><span style="">However, the only one able to communicate with the Dimensional lord was the vassal Do-jaemin.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;He said he is just around the corner.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Ha. &#xA0;This will now come to an end.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">He had tried hard not to show it, but he was quite exhausted inside. &#xA0;Sunggoo started to breath easy again, but Graham shook his head as he looked below at the Colony.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;It is the end.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I know?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Our lives are at an end.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;What?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">The confused Sunggoo followed Graham&apos;s finger.</span></p><p><span style="">Koo-oh-oh.</span></p><p><span style="">Two beings showed their clear presence from afar.</span></p><p><span style="">There were two Dragons flying towards them. &#xA0;One was red and the other was yellow.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Can&apos;t you do something with your barrier?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;My barrier can&apos;t block a Dragon&#x2019;s Breath.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Haha.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Sunggoo wished Woojin would show up before the Dragons could let out their Breaths.</span></p><p><span style="">***</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin let out a sigh when he saw Unon and Shirao block his path.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Couldn&apos;t you guys have just fight me at once? &#xA0;Why fight me in order like this?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I don&apos;t know.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Unon really looked like an Asian man. &#xA0;If he said he was Korean, it would have been believable. &#xA0;He was wearing thin hemp clothes, so Unon looked like an ancestor from medieval times. &#xA0;It evoked a weird feeling inside Woojin.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Whatever. &#xA0;Just hurry up and attack me.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">His Colony was right in front of him if he pushed past these bastards.</span></p><p><span style="">In some ways, Woojin had been fortunate. &#xA0;The most dangerous Dimensional lords headed towards him instead of going to his Colony.</span></p><p><span style="">It would be hard to face the army of monsters, but he thought the Coalition would be able to hold out until he got there.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Why are you in such a hurry?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Unon&apos;s easygoing attitude got on Woojin&apos;s nerves.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Are you worried about your comrades?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;....&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I miss it. &#xA0;I miss the ability to worry about others.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">He had lived so long that he wasn&apos;t able to feel such emotions.</span></p><p><span style="">Unon let out a bitter laugh as he looked at Woojin.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Fatooh and Leia is already heading towards your Colony.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Those lizards?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">The Dragons were considered to be incredibly powerful compared to humans, but they didn&apos;t rate too high amongst the great lords.</span></p><p><span style="">Maybe, this was true, because humans were much more proficient at Domain battles. &#xA0;Amongst the Trahnet&apos;s great lords, there were an unusually high number of humans.</span></p><p><span style="">Even if one observed old records, one would find that humans built nations. &#xA0;They were quite talented in ruling and supervising their lands.</span></p><p><span style="">Dragons were shown to be poor leaders.</span></p><p><span style="">They were a race that would rather cause fear and destruction rather than rule.</span></p><p><span style="">Weren&apos;t the Dragons the 6th and 9th Throne?</span></p><p><span style="">If they were on their way to his Colony...</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Even if you leave right now, it&apos;ll take you 10 minutes to get there. &#xA0;It is enough time for them to raze the Colony to the ground.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Even if he left right now, he would be cutting it close. &#xA0;No, it might be too late for him.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Well, how long will it take for you to take me down?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Unon.</span></p><p><span style="">He had reached the extremes in regards to techniques dealing with the body. &#xA0;Unon was a hard opponent to face even if he received help from the Death Knight. &#xA0;On top of that fact, Unon wasn&apos;t by himself. &#xA0;He had a large force of Minotaurs with him.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Is that impatience I see?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Was this what he was aiming for?</span></p><p><span style="">Was he trying to slightly increase his odds by using such a tactic?</span></p><p><span style="">Unlike his relaxed appearance, it seemed he had been thorough in his preparations. &#xA0;It was cute.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Jeez.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin shook his head from side to side.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Well, this should be just the right amount.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;...what are you talking about?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I&apos;m short around 5%.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;...?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;It&apos;ll be here soon. &#xA0;I prepared this just for you.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;...&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">He had been looking at Woojin to decipher the meaning behind his words. &#xA0;Unon suddenly tilted his head up until it looked as if his neck would snap. &#xA0;He could see a shining star in the clear sky.</span></p><p><span style="">Koo-ah-ah-ah-ah.</span></p><p><span style="">Unon&apos;s eyes opened wide when he saw the meteor slicing through the atmosphere.</span></p><p><span style="">When did he use the meteor summon magic?</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;You are already too late.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;.....&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;As you said before, I&apos;m in a hurry, yet I&apos;ve been talking to you in a relaxed manner. &#xA0;Why did you think I was doing that?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">What this his plan?</span></p><p><span style="">It felt as if he had the table turned against him. &#xA0;Unon had thought he was the one waiting with the trap prepared, yet the Immortal had used his tactic against him.</span></p><p><span style="">The meteor summon magic had a long preparation time, so he must have used it earlier. &#xA0;The Immortal had just been waiting for them to show up.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;This doesn&apos;t change anything.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Unon clenched his fists.</span></p><p><span style="">The meteor couldn&apos;t tell the difference between allies and enemies. &#xA0;It would destroy both the monsters and the Undead army. &#xA0;Moreover, Unon and Shirao would be unharmed.</span></p><p><span style="">The two of them would be enough to stall the Immortal. &#xA0;Once the Immortal&apos;s Colony was destroyed, he would be stuck on Alphen. &#xA0;He would be trapped until he was able to acquire a new Dungeon or a Colony.</span></p><p><span style="">[Goo-haha! &#xA0;Is this the last sacrifice needed for our friend?]</span></p><p><span style="">Jaenis had perfectly completed his mission. &#xA0;After appearing next to Woojin, he immediately formed a barrier. &#xA0;Woojin was able to unsummon his Death Knights and Undead army just in time.</span></p><p><span style="">Kwah-kwah-kwahng!</span></p><p><span style="">The meteor impacted the surface, and the incredible explosion obliterated the monster army.</span></p>
