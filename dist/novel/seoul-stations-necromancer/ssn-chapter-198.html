<p>Chapter 198 - Trahnet (3)</p><p><span style="">Kwah-kwah-kwahng!</span></p><p><span style="">The fragments of ice flew in all directions. &#xA0;The sharp dagger-like ice was turning the surrounding into rubble.</span></p><p><span style="">Koo-ooh-oong!</span></p><p><span style="">Their bodies shook every time the swords clashed. &#xA0;The aftershock was considerable, so an endless amount of dust rose into the air.</span></p><p><span style="">The fierce battle continued. &#xA0;Neither the monsters nor the Undead army was able to approach the two.</span></p><p><span style="">In contrast, the Undead army was slowly gaining the upperhand.</span></p><p><span style="">It was a free for all where the allies and enemies were jumbled together, but this was the type of battle most favored by the Undead army.</span></p><p><span style="">Several Death Knights, who could spare the time, hovered near the battle occurring between Kahng-woojin and Iello. </span></p><p><span style="">[Should we help him?]</span></p><p><span style="">[It is our King&#x2019;s battle.]</span></p><p><span style="">It was an enormous Death Knight with large tusks.</span></p><p><span style="">Kiba just watched as Kahng-woojin fought in a fierce battle.</span></p><p><span style="">He was the supreme commander of the Undead army.</span></p><p><span style="">He was a Necromancer, yet he was about to enter into a realm of being a true Warrior.</span></p><p><span style="">His king was about to take a step forward in this fight, so Kiba couldn&#x2019;t interrupt the fight.</span></p><p><span style="">[Let us clear the surrounding, so we can watch our King&#x2019;s fight.]</span></p><p><span style="">[Let us do that.]</span></p><p><span style="">At Kiba&#x2019;s words, the group of Death Knights near him marched forward with their subordinate Skeleton Warriors to clean up the surrounding.</span></p><p><span style="">Koo-ah-ahng!</span></p><p><span style="">A being impacted on the wall of an enormous building, and it rolled as it took down the building.</span></p><p><span style="">[This is my sixth.]</span></p><p><span style="">The enormous teeth had chewed and spat out its sixth Dimensional lord. &#xA0;The Blood Dragon let out a roar. &#xA0;It raised its head to look for the mad magician.</span></p><p><span style="">The being was letting out a too dangerous of an atmosphere to be called a human.</span></p><p><span style="">Kwah-kwah-kwahng!</span></p><p><span style="">The Hell Flame Dragon Hydra had taken shape as if it was a flower blooming. &#xA0;It raised all of its head. &#xA0;It let out streams of flame as it made the surrounding into a sea of flame.</span></p><p><span style="">During the conflagration, Dread had become a grilled octopus. &#xA0;The Skeleton with the red eyes stepped on Dread as he laughed.</span></p><p><span style="">[This one is my seventh.]</span></p><p><span style="">[Hoong.]</span></p><p><span style="">When the Dragon met the Lich&#x2019;s eyes, it let out a roar as it ascended into the skies again.</span></p><p><span style="">[Kool kool. &#xA0;There is a limit on what a Blood Dragon can do by running amok.]</span></p><p><span style="">This was a bet against a large lizard, who had lost its Dragon&#x2019;s Breath. &#xA0;If Jaenis lost, his pride as a Lich would suffer.</span></p><p><span style="">[Bloom.]</span></p><p><span style="">Hwah-roo-roohk.</span></p><p><span style="">As the Lich swept his hand towards the fallen buildings, the heads of the Hydra appeared as they roared.</span></p><p><span style="">[I&#x2019;ll show you all hell.]</span></p><p><span style="">The Hellfire was emitted from the Hell Dragons. &#xA0;Seoul started to resemble the depths of hell.</span></p><p><span style="">Ggwahng!</span></p><p><span style="">Accompanying an explosion, Iello pulled away as he glared at Woojin. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">The corner of Woojin&#x2019;s mouth lifted.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;You are better than I imagined.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hoong. &#xA0;For a guy who doesn&#x2019;t know what he&apos;s doing, you are pretty good.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Iello&#x2019;s words kept getting on his nerves, so Woojin gave a response.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Why do you keep speaking as if we are acquaintances?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;&#x2026;&#x2026;.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;It is the truth.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;&#x2026;&#x2026;.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;You know about it, Kahng-woojin.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin&#x2019;s eyes narrowed further as he glared at Iello.</span></p><p><span style="">He had always been called the Immortal.</span></p><p><span style="">How many Dimensional lords actually knew his name?</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin&#x2019;s name was extremely famous on earth. &#xA0;However, there was a sense of dissonance when his name was spoken by Iello.</span></p><p><span style="">It gave credence to his words&#x2026;..</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;You exist in this world to hand over the key to me.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Thrash&#x2019;s Executioner?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;You are well informed.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The corner of Iello&#x2019;s mouth lifted into a smirk.</span></p><p><span style="">Chwah-cha-chahng!</span></p><p><span style="">The ice sword had become small as ice was chipped away. &#xA0;However, it grew back to become a large sword again.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;It is time for you to die now for earth..&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Shwahhk!</span></p><p><span style="">Iello&#x2019;s sword came up in a flash, and it aimed for Woojin&#x2019;s head.</span></p><p><span style="">Kah-ahng!</span></p><p><span style="">His Warrior&#x2019;s Weapon deflected the strike, but Woojin&#x2019;s expression was much more complicated than before.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I&#x2019;m sure about one thing.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin opened his mouth as if he was trying to chase away the thoughts cluttering his mind.</span></p><p><span style="">Kah-ahng&#xFF0C;kahng!</span></p><p><span style="">The two swords had crashed into each other three times already, and they were about to repeat the process.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What is it?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;You are going to die by my hands.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hoong. You&#x2019;ve already reached your limit.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Iello had poured everything into this venture to kill Kahng-woojin. &#xA0;Time and preparation was on his side.</span></p><p><span style="">No simulation predicted his loss. &#xA0;The Authority would be transferred to him when he killed Woojin.</span></p><p><span style="">This was all for saving earth and all the Dimensions.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hah-ahp!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Iello&#x2019;s sword was aimed at Kahng-woojin again.</span></p><p><span style="">***</span></p><p><span style="">He was within a cage made out of glass.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Shit!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Toppler was frustrated. &#xA0;He would lose his mind if he didn&#x2019;t cuss out loud.</span></p><p><span style="">The Council was ignorant. &#xA0;They didn&#x2019;t realize how important this change of events was. &#xA0;They were excessive in their zeal to walk the proven path. &#xA0;They continuously revised the errors, yet they kept repeating the same path endlessly.</span></p><p><span style="">Wasn&#x2019;t it time for them to step forward now?</span></p><p><span style="">How long will they restrain themselves before reaching out for the light of hope? </span></p><p><span style="">Toppler wanted to reach it before his life ran out.</span></p><p><span style="">This was why he had met Kahng-woojin.</span></p><p><span style="">He had talked to the Seed of the God of Destruction.</span></p><p><span style="">Weeeeeng.</span></p><p><span style="">The frosted side of the glass brightened before it became transparent. &#xA0;When the glass cleared, Speaker Shelt was standing on the other side.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;It isn&#x2019;t too late to stop the Leone&#x2019;s ship, Shelt.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hah-ah, Toppler. &#xA0;It isn&#x2019;t as if I don&apos;t acknowledge your ability. &#xA0;However, we have to be a bit more careful in this endeavor.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;We don&#x2019;t have time to do so.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;We can still survive two or three more Resets.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Before that happens, we&#x2019;ll die from natural causes.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;&#x2026;&#x2026;.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">It was an undeniable truth.</span></p><p><span style="">Toppler and Shelt was already old.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;It isn&#x2019;t as if we can&#x2019;t do it. &#xA0;You just don&#x2019;t want to do it.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Please watch your tongue.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Shelt&#x2019;s face immediately turned ugly at Toppler&#x2019;s attempt to get a rise. &#xA0;As if to reply with his own expression, Toppler&#x2019;s expression turned fierce.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;We&#x2019;ve already reported this several dozen times. Don&#x2019;t we have to accept our failures and try something different?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Our plan wasn&#x2019;t a failure. &#xA0;It&#x2019;s just incomplete.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Huh&#x2026;.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Toppler felt devastated.</span></p><p><span style="">They had awakened the Recovery Admin, and they had tried to normalize the system.</span></p><p><span style="">They tried hard to regain their lost home planet, yet they kept failing.</span></p><p><span style="">They kept going back to the starting point, but they had continued to follow the same path they had traversed before.</span></p><p><span style="">While they were doing this, the Moon World&#x2019;s time continued to flow. &#xA0;Now there were only old people left in charge, and they were too afraid of making changes.</span></p><p><span style="">The Reset had restarted the events, but the time on the Moon World had never stopped.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Your theory has too much risk involved.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;It is worth trying it out.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;You want to bet the future of the Moon World on your imagination?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;The mechanism maintaining our lives are failing. &#xA0;Is that really a path to our future?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Toppler restlessly walked back and forth.</span></p><p><span style="">He was surrounded on all sides by glass. &#xA0;There was a wall across the glass, and empty space was beyond that&#x2026;..</span></p><p><span style="">They lived on the moon, yet they hadn&#x2019;t been able to colonize it.</span></p><p><span style="">They were just the new lives that had continued the existence of their race.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Please think about the children and our descendents. &#xA0;Please discuss the option of carrying out my prepared plan with the council.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&quot;&#x2026;&#x2026;.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;We need both of them. &#xA0;In the first place, the Deletion Admin and the Recovery Admin has to be summoned at the same time.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Then we are already too late. &#xA0;The two of them has already started their fight.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;&#x2026;&#x2026;.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">The former had lost his memory, and the latter had only retained partial memory. &#xA0;The relationship between the two was already antagonistic, so if both were summoned, it would lead to destruction.</span></p><p><span style="">It wasn&#x2019;t up for debate as to who they&#x2019;ll choose and who they&#x2019;ll throw away.</span></p><p><span style="">Zeeeng.</span></p><p><span style="">Shelt glanced backwards. &#xA0;When the door opened, a soldier entered. &#xA0;Shelt once again looked at Toppler.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;It seems the result is already out.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ah&#x2026;.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Toppler let out a sigh.</span></p><p><span style="">There must be a reason why two beings each held different keys. &#xA0;Now one had died, and the other would hold two keys.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What happened?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;That is&#x2026;.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The soldier had come searching for Speaker Shelt, since he had to give his report. &#xA0;The soldier spoke with a dark expression on his face.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;The outcome was decided before Leone&#x2019;s ship could arrive.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;So who won?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">***</span></p><p><span style="">The blades made out of ice flew in all directions, and they left sharp marks behind. &#xA0;A good number of blades flew towards Woojin. &#xA0;His Soul Barrier formed automatically, and he received no wounds.</span></p><p><span style="">Too-too-too-toohng.</span></p><p><span style="">However, each ice particle sent towards him consumed a soul. &#xA0;The soul disappeared after doing its role.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I&#x2019;ve reached my limit?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Maybe the bastard&#x2019;s words were right. &#xA0;&#xA0;No, the bastard was aiming for this result. &#xA0;He was able to store unlimited amount of souls thanks to the Thrash&#x2019;s Protection. &#xA0;However, the souls were being consumed each time to form a small barrier, and he was reaching an end to his reserves.</span></p><p><span style="">If he didn&#x2019;t have any souls, it would cause problems in creating barriers. &#xA0;However, the bigger problem would be his inability to recover his magical energy in a short amount of time.</span></p><p><span style="">The Undead army was incredibly powerful, but all their magical energy came from the Necromancer. &#xA0;It came from Kahng-woojin.</span></p><p><span style="">His driving for all things was the souls he collected. &#xA0;It was his source of energy.</span></p><p><span style="">Too-too-toong, pshhhk!</span></p><p><span style="">A sharp shard of ice went past the souls, which had been blocking all the fragments. &#xA0;It slid by Woojin&#x2019;s side.</span></p><p><span style="">Iello smiled when he was able to wound Woojin for the first time.</span></p><p><span style="">Chwahhhng!</span></p><p><span style="">All the fragments of ice that had pieced together to form a saw-like blade fell away. &#xA0;A long ice spear made its apppearance.</span></p><p><span style="">Iello gripped it as he charged towards Kahng-woojin.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;This is the end for you.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;No way.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">He had consumed all his souls, yet he was unbelievably calm. &#xA0;For a brief moment, Iello flinched. &#xA0;He had almost been convinced that Kahng-woojin had a hidden card he hadn&#x2019;t used.</span></p><p><span style="">Koong!</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin raised his great sword to block the Ice Spear, and his body slid backwards. &#xA0;He had used up all his magical energy, so he was akin to a common Roused.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;You are bluffing.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Kwahng, kwahng!</span></p><p><span style="">Kahng-woojin was busy focusing on his defense. &#xA0;He was being pushed backwards by the constant attack.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;What a tenacious bastard..&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">Kahng-woojin looked as he was about fall over, yet he resisted. &#xA0;Iello pushed forward as he clicked his tongue. &#xA0;How many years of preparation and Points did he have to waste to catch this single human?</span></p><p><span style="">Kahng-woojin was able to command the dead, and the ability to use souls was almost a cheat ability. &#xA0;Iello had just peeled away the many shell around Kahng-woojin, but he had to use most of his Points gained from being the 25th Throne.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hoo-oohk, hoo.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">When he saw Woojin take ragged breathes for being exhausted, Iello reformed his broken ice spear.</span></p><p><span style="">Zzuh-juh-juhng!</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;This is really the end for you.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;No way.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;&#x2026;&#x2026;.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">It was a bluff. &#xA0;The bastard&#x2019;s magical energy and stamina should be close to zero. &#xA0;There was only one problem that troubled Iello. &#xA0;The corner of the bastard&#x2019;s mouth had be steadily lifting as the fight progressed.</span></p><p><span style="">Shwahhhk!</span></p><p><span style="">Iello was executing his final charge when he caught sight of a broad smile on Kahng-woojin&#x2019;s face.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ninety-nine.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;&#x2026;&#x2026;?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x3008;Level Up!&#x3009;</span></p><p><span style="">Pah-paht.</span></p><p><span style="">In a flash, his nearly non-existent magical energy and stamina was restored. &#xA0;He felt his weakened and damaged Warrior&#x2019;s Weapon recover its durability.</span></p><p><span style="">Hooooong!</span></p><p><span style="">The Warrior&#x2019;s Weapon changed into an axe. &#xA0;It split Iello, who was charging with his spear, in half.</span></p><p><span style="">Pah-ahng!</span></p><p><span style="">The bastard&#x2019;s body was made out of ice.</span></p><p><span style="">The exploding fragments of ice impacted on Woojin&#x2019;s body, but he endured it by gritting hsi teeth.</span></p><p><span style="">He had activated his basic barrier using his magical energy.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Your resistance is useless.&#x2026;.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The broken body of Iello was knitting back together. &#xA0;He regenerated as if nothing had happened to him. &#xA0;Iello had consumed a massive amount of Points, but he didn&#x2019;t particularly care.</span></p><p><span style="">However, instead of distancing himself from Iello, Kahng-woojin grabbed Iello&#x2019;s body after he flung his Warrior&#x2019;s Weapon onto the floor.</span></p><p><span style="">Iello was a Iceman with no heart. &#xA0;He didn&#x2019;t possess any vital spots.</span></p><p><span style="">How do you kill a bastard of his constitution?</span></p><p><span style="">Kahng-woojin had racked his brain, but he could only come up with a single method.</span></p><p><span style="">It was a troublesome Power that could only be used if he consumed most of his magical energy in an instant.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;This is your Punishment.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Shwahhhnk.</span></p><p><span style="">The glove touching Iello&#x2019;s body was dyed black.</span></p><p><span style="">This was a Punishment that allowed Woojin to destroy an opponent&#x2019;s soul by burning all his magical energy.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ggoo-ah-ahk&#xFF01;&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Iello was caught by the black glove, and his body started to melt.</span></p><p><span style="">***</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Who won?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;T....the Deletion Admin won.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;&#x2026;&#x2026;.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">This was unprecedented.</span></p><p><span style="">A change that had never happened before had occurred, and Shelt&#x2019;s face stiffened. &#xA0;The inside of his head was white like a blank piece of paper.</span></p><p><span style="">Naturally, his head turned towards Toppler. &#xA0;Toppler also had a dumbfounded expression on his face as if he had been hit in the face by a hammer.</span></p><p><span style="">Toppler had wanted both of them to survive.</span></p><p><span style="">Since one of them had died, his plan was already dead.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Professor! &#xA0;In the end, you screwed up everything.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">At Shelt&#x2019;s angry scolding, Dr. Toppler raised his &#xA0;head.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;&#x2026;&#x2026;.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;He will soon descend, and if he dominate all the Dimensions, we&#x2019;ll have no future!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">They had to stop him from gaining control over all the Dimensions. &#xA0;The only way to pull this off was to turn back the time, but the Recovery Admin was dead&#x2026;.</span></p><p><span style="">Toppler, who had his head lowered in despair, suddenly stood up.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ah. &#xA0;There might still be a way.&#x201D;</span></p>
