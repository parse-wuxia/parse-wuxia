<p>Chapter 179 - Defense (3)</p><p><span style="">Indulgence.</span></p><p><span style="">This was the only reason why a being with 44 Admin Codes decided to put a Colony on Alphen. </span></p><p><span style="">He wanted to become the Administrator by taking Alphen&apos;s Code as his own.</span></p><p><span style="">There were only five spots here.</span></p><p><span style="">There&#x2019;s always a finite number of Admin Code, and the competition to gain it was fierce.</span></p><p><span style="">The Dimensional lords with other Admin Codes were concentrated on Planet Alphen, because there was an Admin Code that was yet to be settled.</span></p><p><span style="">Unlike other places, this place had too many gods. &#xA0;It had taken them a very long time to find, who had had the real Codes.</span></p><p><span style="">It had taken them over 200 years.</span></p><p><span style="">Still, all the Dimensional lords were easy going in finding the Code. &#xA0;They wanted to enjoy their eternal life. &#xA0;No, they were living a life where death was no longer the end. &#xA0;The process of acquiring the Codes gave them pleasure, and it gave them a goal to pursue.</span></p><p><span style="">This was true until the being that was the exception to the rule appeared.</span></p><p><span style="">On the back of the enormous flying stingray Feris, an extraordinarily extravagant throne was placed there.</span></p><p><span style="">Ilrak had been sitting on the throne. &#xA0;He yawned as he got up, and the guards around him moved alongside him.</span></p><p><span style="">Ilrak&apos;s Seven Knights.</span></p><p><span style="">They served as the tools of Ilrak. The seven knights were first grade vassals, who helped Ilrak rise to his Throne.</span></p><p><span style="">Ilrak left behind his throne as he walked slowly forward. &#xA0;He brushed back his long unruly hair.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Ah. &#xA0;&#xA0;You were always an eyesore.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">He made invidious remarks as he watched Woojin arrive on Shing Shing.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;It&apos;s been awhile.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin half-heartedly raised his hand once, and he looked at the seven knights lined up behind Ilrak. &#xA0;The knights were probably the reason why Ilrak didn&apos;t try to stop Woojin from landing on Feris&apos; back.</span></p><p><span style="">Ilrak trusted his guardian knights too much.</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin got off Shing Shing&apos;s back.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Koo-koohk. &#xA0;How funny.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Ilrak found Woojin&apos;s relaxed attitude to be funny.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;What&apos;s so funny?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I find it funny that you are acting so calm.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Didn&#x2019;t you die at my hands before? &#xA0;Why should I not be relaxed?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">From Woojin&apos;s memory, he knew he had killed Ilrak on three occasions.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;The deaths were a very valuable experience. &#xA0;Have you never considered the possibility that I might have learned from those experiences? &#xA0;I&apos;ve made some preparations to use against you.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Ilrak was still enjoying the situation right now, and there was good reasons to be happy about it. He was about to see the relaxed expression on the Immortal&apos;s face crumple as desperation took hold. &#xA0;It&apos;ll be very enjoyable.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Even if you made preparations, I&apos;m sure you made it in error.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Koo-kook. &#xA0;Your arrogance still remains as same as before.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;It is confidence.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;It seems you still don&apos;t realize what kind of situation you are in.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Ilrak removed the smile from his face.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Unon has gathered the nearby lords, and they are in the process of attacking your Colony. &#xA0;Celrak also gathered an elite unit to clear your Dungeon.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;You guys really have a hard-on for me.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Koo-koohk. &#xA0;That&apos;s right. &#xA0;We are tired of your bullshit. &#xA0;Why do you have to unnecessarily try to awaken the god of Destruction.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">When Ilrak mentioned the god of Destruction Thrash, Woojin laughed. They were being vigilant. &#xA0;No, at this point in time, they looked to be afraid.</span></p><p><span style="">In other words, the Thrash&#x2019;s Executioner was definitely an Item that threatened the Dimensional lords. &#xA0;It was the solution to stop the war and pillaging between Dimensions.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Our problems will be solved if we get rid of you, yet everyone is too scared of you. &#xA0;You are only a mere human.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin smirked. &#xA0;So what allowed Ilrak to have so much confidence in himself?</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;How will you do it?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Koo-koohk. &#xA0;I bet you thought I was sloppy in my planning.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Ilrak raised both his arms.</span></p><p><span style="">A soft light leaked out from Feris&#x2019; back as it made a round barrier.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;However, that isn&#x2019;t the case. &#xA0;You walked into a trap on your own volition.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Ilrak had the smile of victory plastered on his face as he looked at Woojin. </span></p><p><span style="">He wanted the Immortal to feel flustered. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">Ilrak wanted him to hurry up and feel the despair.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;It can only be a trap if it is a threat to me.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Ilrak&#x2019;s smile soured when Woojin continued to act relaxed.</span></p><p><span style="">It seemed the bastard&#x2019;s bravado was on a different level.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;This barrier blocks any summons.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;So what?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Koo-koohk. &#xA0;None of your Familiars will be able to stand here.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;...&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Ilrak let out a belly laugh when Woojin stayed silent.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Koo-ha-ha. &#xA0;Do you understand it now? &#xA0;You are a Necromancer without his familiars. &#xA0;It&apos;ll be too easy for me to lop off your head.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Ilrak let out a smile of victory when he saw Woojin doing nothing. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">Unon and Celrak were a bit lacking in their dignity as great lords.</span></p><p><span style="">They were so afraid of a new Dimensional lord that they planned on isolating him. &#xA0;These were actions taken by cowards.</span></p><p><span style="">Ilrak decided to conduct a research on the Immortal, and when he found a viable hunting method, he decided to take the hunt into his own hands.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Bring me that bastard&apos;s head.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">[We obey your order.]</span></p><p><span style="">The seven knights walked slowly towards Woojin. &#xA0;Ilrak smirked when he saw the Immortal still rooted to the same location.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;He gave up really fast.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;....&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">One, two....six, and seven.</span></p><p><span style="">They weren&apos;t wearing armors. &#xA0;They were wearing similar clothes akin to suits. &#xA0;Moreover, their faces looked similar that it wouldn&apos;t be strange to call them septuplets.</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin remembered that all of them were outstanding at armed conflicts. &#xA0;They were even able to stand up against his tyrannical Death Knights. </span></p><p><span style="">Shwahhhk.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Koo-ha-ha-ha!&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Ilrak roared with laughter when his guardian knights swung their swords.</span></p><p><span style="">It was his victory.</span></p><p><span style="">Unon and Celrak were dumb. &#xA0;They were so scared of this noob Dimensional lord named Immortal that they were wasting Points to take out the Immortal&#x2019;s assets.</span></p><p><span style="">Ilrak had succeeded in eliminating this troublesome Necromancer, so his standing amongst the great lords would....</span></p><p><span style="">Cha-chahng, kahng!</span></p><p><span style="">The Warrior&apos;s Weapon in Woojin&apos;s hand turned into a long sword. &#xA0;The summon of the weapon and the swing was almost simultaneous.</span></p><p><span style="">He had looked as if he had given up on resisting, so his sudden retaliation took a knight by surprise. &#xA0;Woojin&apos;s sword was already embedded in the knight before he could even flinch.</span></p><p><span style="">Chwahhhhk!</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Ggoo-ook.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">When the sword pierced through the throat of a knight, the surprise lasted only a moment. &#xA0;Their formation broke in an instant, but all the knights except the dead one reacted swiftly.</span></p><p><span style="">Kah-kahng, chwahhk!</span></p><p><span style="">Even if they hadn&#x2019;t underestimated their opponent, they would have been found lacking.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Ooh-oohk.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Every time Woojin&apos;s sword passed by the knights, blood fountained forth as they fell dead. &#xA0;Ilrak&apos;s smile of victory had been very wide, and this smile froze in place.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;What...what the hell.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">He was only a mere Necromancer, yet....</span></p><p><span style="">He was supposed to be a Necromancer, who controlled dead knights. &#xA0;When did he learn how to use a sword? &#xA0;Was it after he became a Dimensional lord? &#xA0;Or was it from before?</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Shit!&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">This fact wasn&apos;t important now. &#xA0;The bastard had killed his last guardian knight, and the Immortal was charging towards him.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;What the hell are you all doing! &#xA0;Come out now and take that bastard....&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">He quickly tried to summon his guards, but he had to give up on that idea.</span></p><p><span style="">Zeeeeeng.</span></p><p><span style="">The barrier spread across Feris&apos; large back blocked all summons. &#xA0;It sealed off access to this Dimension.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;What? &#xA0;What&apos;s the rush?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;...&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin&apos;s words were spiteful. &#xA0;Ilrak couldn&apos;t believe he would be killed again by this odious bastard. &#xA0;However, he wasn&apos;t afraid of his eventual death.</span></p><p><span style="">The annoying part was the fact that he hadn&#x2019;t been able to take care of this bastard, who had killed him on three previous occasions. &#xA0;He personally conducted the research to get his revenge, yet...</span></p><p><span style="">The source of his trouble was the fact that he had been disinterested in the Immortal for far too long since revenge didn&apos;t net him any profit.</span></p><p><span style="">Ilrak gave up on running away. &#xA0;He glared at Woojin. &#xA0;If he couldn&apos;t get out of this, at the very least, he wouldn&apos;t act in an ugly way.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I regret that I didn&apos;t nip you in the bud.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;You are right.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin agreed with that statement. &#xA0;The territory of Alandal had occupied a significant portion of Alphen. &#xA0;When he had declared himself the king, the Dimensional lords had left him alone.</span></p><p><span style="">If the Dimensional lords were human, they probably would have come at him for revenge. &#xA0;However, they had died several hundred to several thousand times before, so they were dull to such emotions. &#xA0;Instead of the desire for revenge, they were more worried about losing their Points.</span></p><p><span style="">Moreover, Woojin was so foul that they had avoided him. &#xA0;He was akin to shit to them.</span></p><p><span style="">Since he was merely a human, they knew he would die someday. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">The Dimensional lords had thought Woojin was playing at king amongst the dead corpses. &#xA0;However, he had been devious, and he was aiming for the revival of the god of Destruction. &#xA0;If Ilrak knew about this, he would have killed the Immortal long ago.</span></p><p><span style="">The Dimensional lords would have united to work against any plans regarding the god of Destruction.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;It is as you have said. &#xA0;I made a mistake. &#xA0;My preparations were inadequate.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin smirked at Ilrak&apos;s words.</span></p><p><span style="">These bastards were really deluding themselves.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I&apos;m saying the preparation itself was the mistake.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;....&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin&apos;s smile deepened when Ilrak couldn&apos;t comprehend what he was trying to say.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;You guys look like a delicious buffet table to me.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;What do you mean?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;You don&apos;t need to know anything.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;....&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin sword moved gently across Ilrak&apos;s throat, but the result of his action was gruesome.</span></p><p><span style="">In a flash, Ilrak was slaughtered, and his body was surrounded by gray light before it disappeared.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;This is the mother of all grinding.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">He would have had to sweep through Alphen to find each and every one of his enemies, yet hundreds of thousands of his enemies were gathering to attack him. &#xA0;He was thankful for their actions.</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin leisurely raised the seven guardian knights as zombies. &#xA0;He made them move towards the head of Feris.</span></p><p><span style="">Goo-uh-uh.</span></p><p><span style="">When they arrived at the head of the large stingray, he caused the corpses to explode.</span></p><p><span style="">Ggooh-ah-ahng!</span></p><p><span style="">Accompanying the explosion, the stingray flopped in the air as it fell towards the ground. &#xA0;Woojin summoned Shing Shing, and he got on.</span></p><p><span style="">Even as he was falling towards the ground, he looked at the great monster army covering the ground beneath him. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">All the Dimensional lords of Alphen was aiming for him?</span></p><p><span style="">He was so thankful that he didn&apos;t know what to do.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Shall I start my power leveling?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">The already dead souls wandering around the battlefield was sucked towards Woojin. &#xA0;It was as if he was a black hole.</span></p><p><span style="">***</span></p><p><span style="">Hwah-roo-roohk, kwahng!</span></p><p><span style="">The magical energy emanating from his body passed through the staff, and the amplified flame magic flew towards the enemies. &#xA0;It was very destructive, but it was also well below Sunggoo&apos;s expectation.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Shit!&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">They were reaching the one hour mark, and he had poured out most of his magic. &#xA0;He had killed over 1,000 monsters.</span></p><p><span style="">His hardened expression refused to relax, because the enemies were endless despite his kills.</span></p><p><span style="">It was as if he had taken a bucket of water out of the sea. &#xA0;He couldn&apos;t delay the great army.</span></p><p><span style="">The bastards didn&apos;t even stop to pick up the corpses of their comrades. &#xA0;They just stepped over the wounded and the dead as they advanced.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;We are royally screwed if things continue along this path.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Sunggoo had immediately mobilized when they received the news that the large army was on the move. &#xA0;Even though the Dimensional lords hadn&apos;t taken active roles in the battle, there was no change to the progress of the army as Sunggoo darted in and out to detonate his magic.</span></p><p><span style="">It would take the great army about 5 days for it to reach the Saurus Colony.</span></p><p><span style="">Should they defend the Colony by putting their trust in the castle walls? &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">It was impossible.</span></p><p><span style="">The Saurus castle wouldn&apos;t be able to hold out for more than half a day.</span></p><p><span style="">The Colony would merely be a brief impediment to their charge.</span></p><p><span style="">Shwahhhk!</span></p><p><span style="">The swarm of bats gathered in the sky, and they coalesced to form Jaemin. &#xA0;He appeared next to Sunggoo.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Hyung! &#xA0;Unon is personally coming here. &#xA0;We have to get out of here.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Hoo. &#xA0;All right.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">The army of 100,000 monsters was beyond what he had imagined. &#xA0;The army was so large that the advance party was a day ahead of the main force. &#xA0;This was also the reason why Sunggoo was able to conduct a guerrilla warfare.</span></p><p><span style="">However, it would be dangerous if he was caught by the Dimensional lords. &#xA0;This was why he had teamed up with Do-jaemin. &#xA0;Jaemin used all his efforts to keep track of the Dimensional lords.</span></p><p><span style="">Jaemin consoled Sungoo, who looked depressed.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Don&apos;t despair too much over this.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Hoo. &#xA0;My feelings doesn&apos;t matter. &#xA0;We really might die here.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;That&apos;s...&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Sunggoo wasn&apos;t feeling despair. &#xA0;He was angry that his abilities couldn&apos;t make a difference.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Hyung. &#xA0;Why don&apos;t you attack the terrain instead of the monsters?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;What are you talking about?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;If we change the terrains, we&apos;ll be able to delay their advance.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Huh?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Sunggoo&apos;s eyes turned round. &#xA0;What would the monsters do if he got rid of the roads? &#xA0;No matter how they responded to it, it&apos;ll delay their advance.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;As expected of someone who took school seriously!&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Hahah...&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Sungoo hyung went to college, so he should be more knowledgeable... &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">Jaemin let out an awkward laugh.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Let&apos;s get out of here first.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;All right. &#xA0;I&apos;ll have to scout the surrounding again.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Sunggoo and Jaemin quickly got out of there. &#xA0;It was easy to predict the movement of the army, since they knew their final destination.</span></p><p><span style="">If they were able to pick and destroy the treacherous parts of the roads, it would surely help them delay this army.</span></p><p><span style="">There was 5 days left until Woojin&#x2019;s promised return.</span></p>
