We received an official request to come help here. The Alandal guild members have the right to pass through. Please let us in.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;B&#x2026;but.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Jung-michan pushed past the flustered soldier, and he walked forward by force. Sunggoo and Haemin used this opportunity to jump after Minchan, and Woo-soonhoon also followed after them.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Get out of my way.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Lee-sahngho ordered the soldiers in anger, and they unconsciously stepped back. Jiwon also used this opportunity to head past the first line.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ah ah&#x2026;.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tears were streaming down Jiwon&#x2019;s face. Her eyes picked up Woojin figure. Blood was staining various parts of his body. Moreover, there was a deep sword wound on his face&#x2026;</span></p><p><span style="">Jiwon ran forward as tears fell down her face.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;President!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Kahng-woojin blinked his eyes when he saw Jung-minchan, Hong-sunggoo, Kim-haemin and Woo-soonghoon run towards him.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Uh? When did you guys get here?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;We came here as soon as we saw the news.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ah, is that so? I dropped my hand phone somewhere around here. Help me look for it..&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Ah. Currently, the whole nation was in a state of unrest because of president yet&#x2026;</span></p><p><span style="">Before the slack-jawed group could respond, Jiwon ran forward to hug Woojin. Woojin was pushed back a step when she jumped into him.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hoo-hook. Woojin.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Jiwon?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hoo-uh-uhng. I worried so much about you.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Jiwon looked up at him with face covered in tears, and she had a runny nose. Woojin grinned. The medicine absorbed well into her.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;You&#x2019;ve gotten pretty..&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hoo-ooh-oong, hoo-ook.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">She was shedding tears uncontrollably. Yes, she became prettier.</span></p><p><span style="">She wan thankful. She was so thankful that she couldn&#x2019;t hold herself back.</span></p><p><span style="">She had been shocked when he entered the 6 star Dungeon&#x2026; Her heart became nervous when she thought about what could go wrong&#x2026; She would be able to thank him, and she wouldn&#x2019;t be able to give him an answer.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What happened to your face? Hoo-hook. You idiot. Why did you get hurt like this?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Jiwon caressed Woojin&#x2019;s face.</span></p><p><span style="">Uh. If she touched it like that, the medicine will come off. It was going to disappear tomorrow&#x2026;.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hoo-hook. What are you going to do being hurt like this?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Jiwon cried in sorrow. She had regained her face. However, Woojin&#x2019;s face&#x2026;.</span></p><p><span style="">No. It didn&#x2019;t matter to her.</span></p><p><span style="">Even if Woojin became a monster, she wouldn&#x2019;t care.</span></p><p><span style="">She was just thankful he came back alive.</span></p><p><span style="">When she received the ring as present, Jiwon had chosen her answer.</span></p><p><span style="">She was infinitely lacking compared to Woojin, but&#x2026;.</span></p><p><span style="">If he was ok with her&#x2026;</span></p><p><span style="">Jiwon grabbed Woojin around the neck, then she stole his lips.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Oop.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin&#x2019;s eyes turned round from surprise. Why was she acting this way?</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hoo-ook. This is my answer.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Uh? He had never asked her a question, So what answer?</span></p><p><span style="">When Woojin became confused, Jiwon pushed her finger forward.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;You gave me a ring. I also like you.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;&#x2026;.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin didn&#x2019;t know what was going on, so he started to look around his surrounding. He caught sight of Woo-soonghoon standing next to Jung-minchan with both his thumbs in the air.</span></p><p><span style="">Ah, it was that bastard. It was that bastard again.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Hweeeek. President is so cool.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">He said it in a low voice, but everyone could hear him&#x2026; That guy was so tactless. What should he do about that whistling bastard?</span></p><p><span style="">Jiwon was holding Woojin tightly. He pushed her away with a thumb on her forehead.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I guess you aren&#x2019;t afraid of anything. Who are you pushing your mouth towards to?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Uh?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;A ghost is going to latch on to you. Get off me.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Peee. What&#x2026;.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Jiwon was about to give a sullen answer when she realized where she was. She quickly separated from him. Woojin was someone the entire population of Korea was paying attention to.</span></p><p><span style="">He was a famous person&#x2026;.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;I was thoughtless&#x2026;.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">Even at that moment, the cameras of the reporters were tirelessly recording this scene.</span></p><p><span style="">She hadn&#x2019;t been able to control her emotions, and her eyes didn&#x2019;t see anything except Woojin. Now that she came to her senses she really regretted her action. Did she cause more harm than good&#x2026;</span></p><p><span style="">Jiwon was thinking to herself, when Lee-sahngho grabbed Woojin&#x2019;s shoulder.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hey.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;&#x2026;.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin wordlessly turned his head around to look behind him.</span></p><p><span style="">Lee-sahngo&#x2019;s angry face came into view.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Why isn&#x2019;t my dongsaeng coming out?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Dongsaeng? He was the oppa of the noisy woman, who had followed after him?</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Whether it is the oppa or the dongsaeng, it seems both of you have a bad habit of rudely touching other&#x2019;s body without consent.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin glared at Lee-sahngho. Lee-sahngho flinched as he took his hand off of Woojin and he took a step back.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Shit. What kind of eyes is that?&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">Swear words were about to automatically come out of his mouth, but there were too many people watching them.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What happened to my dongsaeng? Maybe&#x2026;.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ah, she&#x2019;s dead.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;How can this be&#x2026;. Her corpse? Why didn&#x2019;t you bring out her corpse? Isn&#x2019;t it reasonable to treat the dead with respect?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">One had to treat a teammate, who had cleared the Dungeon with one, with respect. Obviously, this was a rule that had to be kept. If he hadn&#x2019;t fared well in the there, then his actions could be exscused. However, Woojin had come out after clearing the Dungeon.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;The corpse&#x2026;.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin looked around his surrounding. His guild family, soldiers, reporters, Lee-sahngho and the Hwarang&#x2019;s family were all here.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Well, this place isn&#x2019;t Alphen.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">He didn&#x2019;t need to make a big deal out of this.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;She was a brave woman.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;&#x2026;?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;She attacked an enemy she shouldn&#x2019;t have provoked. She died bravely.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;W..who did it? Which monster killed my dongsaeng?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">A monster&#x2026;.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Immortal.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Immortal&#x2026;.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin patted the shoulder of Lee-sahngho, who was quietly repeating the word like a mantra. Woojin headed back towards his Guild family.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Did you find my phone?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026; the army should be holding it for you.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin and the Alandal guild members headed towards the command center located within the hotel.</span></p><p><span style="">Lee-sahngho&#x2019;s clenched fists shook.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;P&#x2026;please calm down. There are a lot of people watching us.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Gather the reporters.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Mother fucker. Do you think I&#x2019;ll stay put sucking my thumb?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The Dungeon Break didn&#x2019;t happen. Lee-yunhwee was dead.</span></p><p><span style="">Worst.</span></p><p><span style="">This was the worst of the worst case scenario.</span></p><p><span style="">Lee-sahngo calculated inside his head. His gaze headed towards the disappearing Woojin.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;That mother f&#x2026;.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Now that he thought about it ever since that bastard appeared, it felt like Woojin was always blocking his path. He stole a 5 star Dungeon not too long ago, and now he stole the 6 star Dungeon.</span></p><p><span style="">Lee-sahngho was barely able to hold back his anger. He got in the car to avoid the eyes of other people.</span></p><p><span style="">Ddi-ri-di-ri-dingdong. Ddi-ri-di-ri-dingdong.</span></p><p><span style="">Lee-sahngho saw the name that accompanied the ring tone, and his stress level shot up a notch. He had to pick up the call from this number.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Uh-hooh. Fuck.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Accompanying a cuss words, he pressed the answer button on his hand phone.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes, chairman. Yes&#x2026; Yes. I will take those steps. Yes. I&#x2019;ll minimize the damage as much&#x2026;.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">After awhile, Lee-sahngho ended his phone call, and he tried to calm his insides, which was seething with anger.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hooh-ooh. That fucker Kahng-woojin. &#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The crazy Roused had come out of nowhere. Rank A? That rank might be a joke now. The media was already labeling him as a Rank AA Roused.</span></p><p><span style="">Yunhwee probably helped him. However, two people had cleared a 6 star Dungeon&#x2026;.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;He probably thinks he made it out well by himself?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Lee-sahngho chewed on his lips. Even if Woojin was some outstanding high ranked Roused, he didn&#x2019;t care. The society was organic and everything was intricately intertwined.</span></p><p><span style="">Kim-gangchul was the number 1 Ranked Roused in Korea, but Lee-sahngho wasn&#x2019;t afraid of him. Kim-gangchul was powerless.</span></p><p><span style="">If one insisted on being principled when everyone was bending the rules, then it was the end of that person.</span></p><p><span style="">On the other hand, Lee-sahngho was influential.</span></p><p><span style="">Hwarang was one of the 3 great guilds of Korea. He had personal connections with politicians, and people from the financial world.</span></p><p><span style="">His dongsaeng Yunhwee hadn&#x2019;t like it, but Hwarang was able to grow so large, because he learned how to get on in the world. Moreover, the connections with these people had a large role in the growth.</span></p><p><span style="">He hadn&#x2019;t been wrong.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I can&#x2019;t stand it when someone steals something from me.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin dared to get in the way of his ambition?</span></p><p><span style="">Lee-sahngho&#x2019;s eyes narrowed.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Life is a battlefield. Jot-mahn-ah.&#x201D; (TLN: He quoted a 2009 Korean meme)</span></p><p><span style="">He&#x2019;ll teach Woojin a stern lesson.</span></p><p><span style="">*</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I just cleared one Dungeon, so why do I have to do an interview?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Then I&#x2019;ll decline the interview. I&#x2019;ll send out a press release to the media with the information you have given me.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;You do that.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What are you going to do about finding the Artifacts?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I guess I&#x2019;ll return home after I find them all.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I&#x2019;ll make it so that you will be able to use this hotel for a month. Director Hong, and Haemin will stay to help.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I guess one porter and an errand boy is enough.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Sunggoo and Haemin puffed out their cheeks.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Oh yeah. What did my mother say?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin had been secretly worried about his mother. Every time he went into the Dungeon, he was always put on tv&#x2026;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Well&#x2026; Please listen to my words without being too shocked, president.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What? What happened?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">It was news about his family, so Woojin was nervous. At Woojin&#x2019;s query, Jung-minchan spoke with a straight face.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;She doesn&#x2019;t know about it yet.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I contacted her, and she hasn&#x2019;t watch the tv yet. So she doesn&#x2019;t know about this.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;&#x2026;.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin&#x2019;s forehead furrowed. He guessed it would be better than her finding out and being worried about him. Still, somehow it gave him a odd feeling&#x2026;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;She said she couldn&#x2019;t reach president by phone. I took the liberty to tell her that you had left your hand phone in your office, and you were away on a business trip..&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;&#x2026;.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;A&#x2026;are you okay with that?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Haha. Of course&#x2026; So, I&#x2019;m guessing this incident hasn&#x2019;t come up continuously on the news?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;After the breaking news came out, the news channels have been showing this location on a live feed.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;&#x2026;.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;This is the first time a 2 man team attempted a 6 star Dungeon, so even the foreign presses are treating this incident as newsworthy.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;&#x2026;.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">It still felt odd&#x2026;.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What was my mother doing?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;The moving date was approaching, so she was going around shopping for furniture&#x2026;&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;&#x2026;.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">His mother must be really excited&#x2026;. She didn&#x2019;t have any time to watch tv&#x2026;.</span></p><p><span style="">Maybe this was for the best?</span></p><p><span style="">He didn&#x2019;t want his family to worry about useless things.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;If I head back after picking up all the Artifacts, then wouldn&#x2019;t it be past the moving date?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Mr. Soonghoon and I will take care of it. President should just focus on clearing the Dungeon.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Uh, ok. Thank&#x2026;.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;No. This is naturally the job of the the Support Division. Then we&#x2019;ll leave you to it.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Jung-minchan got up. Kim-haemin and Woo-soonghoon also got up.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Please carry on with your conversation.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Kim-haemin was pushing in his chair, when he grabbed Hong-sunggoo&#x2019;s arm. He was sitting there being tactless.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Director Hong. We still haven&#x2019;t finished the conversation from earlier.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes? What conversation?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Kim-hamein&#x2019;s eyes kept moving trying to give Sunggoo a hint. However, Sunggoo obliviously looked back at him, while he drank his Cafe Mocha.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ha ha ha. Let&#x2019;s go first. Let&#x2019;s go talk over there.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Sunggoo still hadn&#x2019;t picked up what Kim-haemin was trying to imply. He eventually just took Sunggoo away from the table. Woojin and Jiwon was the only one left.</span></p><p><span style="">Jiwon&#x2019;s cheeks turned red for no reason at all.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What happened to your work? How were you able to come here?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Uh? That is&#x2026;.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">She had come here without any plan. This was the first time she had been absent without notice during the past 4 years she worked at the company.</span></p><p><span style="">No. She had to miss work yesterday, because of Woojin. So was this her second time doing this? She would have never done such a thing before she had met Woojin.</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin grinned as he looked at Jiwon.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;You are more hopeless than you look.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">He was probably more hopeless than her.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;You like me?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Uh? The ring you gave&#x2026; I thought about it for a long time and my heart&#x2026;&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">That was the result of Woo-soonghoon overdoing it. Still, that wasn&#x2019;t important right now.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;This woman is asking for big trouble.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Uh?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;You like to live dangerously liking a guy like me. &#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;&#x2026;.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Jiwon wordlessly lowered her gaze. Her eyes immediately welled up, and tears started to drip down.</span></p><p><span style="">So that&#x2019;s how it was. Woojin considered her a burden.</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin was too important for a mere factory worker to covet him.</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin looked at Jiwon, who was crying wordlessly.</span></p><p><span style="">Her soul was clean without a speck on her soul. It was a pure soul.</span></p><p><span style="">How much would the evil spirits like her? How much will they torment and wound her?</span></p><p><span style="">He should keep her far away and protect her, but Woojin&#x2019;s heart was&#x2026;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin grabbed Jiwon&#x2019;s chin, and he forcefully lifted her gaze.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Do you like ghosts?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;&#x2026;?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;If you aren&#x2019;t afraid of them, then give it a try.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The confused Jiwon stopped her tears when Woojin laughed.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I&#x2019;ll let you live a spooktacular life.&#x201D; (TLN: If the readers want it, I listen. ^_^)</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;&#x2026;.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">This scene was being photographed from afar with a telephoto lens. The person looked too dubious to be called a reporter.</span></p><p></p></div><p></p>
