<p>Chapter 168 -&#xA0;Reconstruction (1)</p><p><span style="">Go-shoo-shoo&apos;s army was annihilated.</span></p><p><span style="">They hadn&apos;t been repelled. &#xA0;They hadn&apos;t had the opportunity retreat either. &#xA0;They were simply annihilated.</span></p><p><span style="">The corpses on Go-shoo-shoo&apos;s vanished territory rose up as Undeads, and the Immortal was leading this army.</span></p><p><span style="">The people, who were confused, were the refugees that had hidden from Go-shoo-shoo&apos;s offensive campaign.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I don&#x2019;t believe it. &#xA0;This is the prelude to a calamity.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;That&apos;s right. &#xA0;What reason does the Immortal have for helping us?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">The fear and repulsion towards the Immortal was almost an instinct for these people. &#xA0;Many people here had lost their family members in the war with Alandal. &#xA0;They couldn&apos;t even recover their corpses as they became Undeads.</span></p><p><span style="">Melody was barely able to gather the people here, and they were talking in hushed voices. &#xA0;They were nervous. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">The heroes, who had been the hope of the coalition, were also confused by the situation.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;What is his endgame?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I don&apos;t believe it. &#xA0;You are saying he is doing this as an act of goodwill without any payment expected in return?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Melody was in the middle of this dispute.</span></p><p><span style="">Melody thoroughly understood the confused feeling of her people. &#xA0;She had also been surprised time and time again by the Immortal. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">She looked at the 6 heroes gathered here.</span></p><p><span style="">Graham, Tauric and Latasha was present. &#xA0;Then there was the young king of the Honshoo kingdom named Kontz, Orc chieftain Krueger and the Dwarf King Raul.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;There is something you should all know.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;....&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">When everyone&apos;s attention was focused on her, she opened her small mouth.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Immortal is human. &#xA0;He is the same as us.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Nonsense!&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Your joke is in poor taste, Voice of Aria!&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">She calmly raised her voice at the heated responses.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I followed my goddess&apos; oracle. &#xA0;I was guided to earth, and I saw the true identity of the Immortal. &#xA0;We were the ones that had misunderstood him.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;.....&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Dwarf King Raul asked a question amongst the silence.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;How was he over there? &#xA0;Was he less rash, less cruel and less tyrannical?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;On earth he,...&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Melody thought over the question, and she pursed her lips.</span></p><p><span style="">Even on earth, the Immortal had been rash and tyrannical. &#xA0;He had done whatever he wanted to do.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I knew it. &#xA0;The Immortal is the Immortal. &#xA0;He is calamity personified. &#xA0;We won&apos;t dance from happiness, because he is capricious in nature. &#xA0;We lost too many to do that.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">His words were correct. &#xA0;However...</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;However, it is also true that he is helping us.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;...&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">That was true. &#xA0;Go-shoo-shoo&apos;s Colony was being dismantled right now. &#xA0;Go-shoo-shoo&apos;s Dungeons were all cleared, and he no longer had a foothold in this world. &#xA0;If he wanted to come back to Alphen, Go-shoo-shoo would have to return through another Dungeon. However, this was a long ways off.</span></p><p><span style="">Basically, a Dimensional lord that had caused terror in this region was gone. &#xA0;This was also the reason why the people that had escaped in every direction were able to gather here.</span></p><p><span style="">There were over a thousand people here, who were sick and tired of being afraid and exhausted.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;He is our hope. &#xA0;This is the word of my goddess.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">The heroes still wasn&apos;t satisfied even after hearing Melody&apos;s appeal. &#xA0;It didn&apos;t matter if her words were true. &#xA0;They had too much enmity and feelings stacked against the Immortal.</span></p><p><span style="">Moreover, they couldn&apos;t hide the fear and worry they had towards the Immortal.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I wonder if this is like chasing a Wyvern away to bring in a Dragon.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;That&apos;s right. &#xA0;Our future will still be very uncertain if we rely on him.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Melody&apos;s face darkened a little bit as she spoke.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;The important part is that he is making a sacrifice for our sake.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Huh. &#xA0;What sacrifice is the Immortal making for us?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;...&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">While they continued this hopeless conversation, a Phantom Steed galloped towards them. &#xA0;&#xA0;When the Immortal got closer, the heroes unconsciously grabbed their weapons.</span></p><p><span style="">They were tense as their palms became sweaty just from the Immortal appearing. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Yo.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin jumped off Shing Shing, and he stood amongst them.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;What are you all doing?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;....&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin furrowed his brows. &#xA0;They were either looking at each other or they looked at the ground.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;What? What&apos;s with this atmosphere?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">The heroes tensed at Woojin&apos;s playful words. &#xA0;Melody spoke quietly into this tense atmosphere.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;They still feel awkward at receiving help from Immortal-nim... &#xA0;Eventually they will adjust....&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Ah ah.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin grinned as he looked at the people that was unable to look him in the eyes.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;We&apos;ve been fighting a life and death battle, yet it looks like I&apos;m suddenly pretending to be friendly with you. &#xA0;Is that how it is?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;...&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Alliance. &#xA0;This is an alliance. &#xA0;Who doesn&apos;t have enmity against others? &#xA0;Stop acting like children.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin looked over them when his gaze stopped at Latasha.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Are you going to keep acting up?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin unfurled two fingers to point at her eyes. &#xA0;She looked up at him.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;If you continue to glare at me like that, I&apos;ll string up your bones.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;....&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Her pride didn&apos;t allow her to avoid his gaze, but Latasha&apos;s eyes were unfocused as it shook. &#xA0;The light in the Immortal&apos;s eyes said he was telling her the truth. &#xA0;He wasn&apos;t joking.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;It isn&apos;t as if you guys are the only ones with enmity. &#xA0;I&apos;ll bury my enmity towards you all. &#xA0;So let us refrain ourselves. &#xA0;If you really don&apos;t like me that much, you can attack me. &#xA0;Do you think it&#x2019;ll make much of a difference if I kill one or two more people?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;....&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">He was probably the only one that could speak those words so naturally on this planet. &#xA0;No... &#xA0;Even if one searched through this Dimension, the Immortal was unique.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;If you don&apos;t have a death wish, don&apos;t look at me with that look in your eyes. &#xA0;Ok?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;...&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;You aren&#x2019;t going to answer me?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;...understood.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">It was as if Latasha had unwillingly squeezed out those words. &#xA0;Woojin smiled when he heard it.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;All right. &#xA0;Give me your opinions about the Colony.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Which Colony are you talking about?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I&apos;ll have to set up a base of operations where all the forces of the coalition would gather.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">The heroes looked at each other, and their face was glowing. &#xA0;They were going to rebuild the scattered coalition forces....</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Don&apos;t we have to pick a place that is easy to defend?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Dwarf King Raul started drawing a map on the floor.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;There is a deep ravine here. &#xA0;It&apos;ll be a good enough place to gather the people.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin look at the map, and he pointed at a location.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Where&apos;s this?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;This is the Sauraus mountain. The surrounding region is quite open around this pointed mountain, so one would be easily found by one&apos;s enemies.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;An open space....&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;The area is elevated, but it is debateable as to whether one could use that to one&apos;s advantage in defending the place. &#xA0;Moreover, it is an easy place to isolate and cut off the supplies to the mountain. &#xA0;The most important factor is that Juliel has set up his Colony there.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;So this place is where the dog house is located at?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Trahnet&apos;s great lord. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">Second Throne Juliel.</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin laughed as he picked up a stick to plant it at the location.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I&apos;ll build my Colony here.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;As I said, that place is...&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Raul was about to protest, but he shut his mouth when he caught sight of Woojin&apos;s eyes.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I&apos;ll do the cleaning. &#xA0;Just get ready to move.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;.....&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">After Woojin finished talking, he called over the two dongsaengs that was approaching them.</span></p><p><span style="">Hwah-roo-roohk.</span></p><p><span style="">A ball of fire suddenly dropped from the sky accompanied by a small explosion. &#xA0;When the flames died away, a man with a warm expression greeted the others.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Hello.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Chee-ji-ji-jeek.</span></p><p><span style="">A swarm of bats coalesced to form a person. &#xA0;This person lowered his head.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Nice to meet you.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">The heroes awkwardly nodded their heads when Hong-sunggoo and Do-jaemin arrived.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Both of you get acquainted with them, since you&apos;ll be travelling together often.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Heh heh. &#xA0;I look forward to working with you all.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Let us all get along.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin secretly smiled at their naive greetings. &#xA0;This reminded him of the time when he was first summoned to Alphen during his 3rd year of high school.</span></p><p><span style="">I was a hellish period in his life.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Uh? &#xA0;Where are you going, hyung?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I&apos;m cleaning up the place where we&apos;ll be moving in.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;What? &#xA0;This place has apartments?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;...&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">It wasn&apos;t even worth his time to respond to those words. &#xA0;Woojin rode Shing Shing as he waved his hand, then he disappeared far into the distance.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Heh he. &#xA0;Since the atmosphere is a bit awkward, how about we introduce ourselves over some alcohol?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;....&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">The people were still being awkward at Sunggoo&apos;s words, so he turned to look at Jaemin.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Hey, Jaemin. &#xA0;Why don&apos;t you bring out some stuff from that Dimensional storage or whatever. &#xA0;Alcohol and...&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Yes...&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin had granted authority to Do-jaemin, so he had a partial access to the Domain storage. &#xA0;It was usually used to put in any loots they gathered, but it could also be used to take stuff out.</span></p><p><span style="">Jaemin started taking out food and alcohol. &#xA0;Sunggoo diligently filled each cup.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Shall we drink?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">As the alcohol started being passed around, Suggoo had a bright smile on his face.</span></p><p><span style="">It seemed like a distant memory, but his college life hadn&apos;t been all for naught.</span></p><p><span style="">What better way was there to break the awkwardness? &#xA0;Alcohol and games were the best way to become friendly with others.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Well, since we&apos;ve started, let&apos;s go full tilt. &#xA0;Let&apos;s share it with everyone.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">There were almost 2000 people gathered here.</span></p><p><span style="">However, the Dimensional Domain&apos;s storage was massive.</span></p><p><span style="">The storage would still be overflowing with food even if they fed everyone here. &#xA0;Do-jaemin didn&apos;t hold back in taking out the food. &#xA0;It had been a long time since the village people were able to satiate their hunger.</span></p><p><span style="">Maybe what the people really needed was a solution to hunger and safety rather than revenge.</span></p><p><span style="">They had been fighting tooth and nail to live and have some semblance of life...</span></p><p><span style="">Maybe they&apos;ll have to live in the shadow of a being that lived in order not to die.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Drink! &#xA0;Drink! &#xA0;Chug down that alcohol!&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;....&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Sunggoo took the lead of the party, and it continued into the dawn.</span></p><p><span style="">***</span></p><p><span style="">Summit of Sauraus Mountain.</span></p><p><span style="">Juliel had a stunned expression as he looked at Necromancer Kahng-woojin, who had brought his Undead army to his doorstep.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I don&apos;t understand you.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;What?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;What enmity do you have against me? &#xA0;We are Dimensional lords, so why do we have to waste resources to fight each other?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;You think this is a waste?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;It is a waste. &#xA0;In the end, there is nothing to be gained from this. &#xA0;Isn&apos;t this a waste of Points?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Hmmm.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin stroked his chin.</span></p><p><span style="">If one excluded death, what did one gain from this? &#xA0;Maybe he&apos;ll be able to find out a little bit about how the Dimensional lords think.</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin discreetly threw a bait out.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;So do you have the Code?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Are you coveting the throne? &#xA0;If so, why the hell are you doing this?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin&apos;s eyes shone.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Weren&apos;t you on the Second Throne?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;You are very clueless about the Rankings. I stole one Throne. I&apos;m in the Third Throne now.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">He understood it.</span></p><p><span style="">There were 72 great lords of Trahnet.</span></p><p><span style="">The Throne were numbered from 1 to 72.</span></p><p><span style="">This was a Ranking they kept, and it depended on how many one posessed.</span></p><p><span style="">If one wanted to steal a seat, one had to accumulate points. &#xA0;Once one gets to the 73rd Ranking, one had the qualification to challenge the first Throne.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;There&apos;s the Code I haven&apos;t found yet....&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin&apos;s mumbling was well received by Juliel.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Ah, you are talking about the Code. &#xA0;Ah ah. &#xA0;You came back to Alphen to look for it?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Isn&#x2019;t one Code the same as all the other Codes?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;What the hell are you talking about? &#xA0;Each Code&apos;s authority....&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Juliel&apos;s expression hardened in mid sentence. &#xA0;He suddenly stood up.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;You bastard. &#xA0;You don&apos;t know about the Code.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin shrugged his shoulders.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;If I knew about it, why would I need to put out my feelers?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;How dare you! How daaaaaaaare you!&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Juliel became enraged when he realized he had been tricked.</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin smirked as he took out his Warrior&apos;s Weapon.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Our Bibi is the best in taking care of dogs.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">If Bibi was here, she could have use her illusions. &#xA0;Wouldn&apos;t she have been able to gain more information?</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin was disappointed, but he quickly let go of those feelings.</span></p><p><span style="">&apos;Well, Bibi has her own work to do.&apos;</span></p><p><span style="">She was probably having a good time decorating the Colony.</span></p><p><span style="">She had the experience of building up the Dimensional Domain, so she would do really well in her current task.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;You bastard! &#xA0;How dare you trick me!&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;You were the one that allowed yourself to be duped.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Koo-ahh-ahk!&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin and Juliel clashed.</span></p><p><span style="">***</span></p><p><span style="">Bibi was in the control tower as she looked over the large aircraft carrier. &#xA0;The vine tree had grown over the control tower to become the Colony&apos;s symbol, and one could enter the control tower from the root like a house. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Hmmmm.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">The deck was large, but most of the living facilities were at the passenger&apos;s quarters.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;What&apos;s troubling you, Bibi?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Ah, Sooah.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Bibi happily greeted Sooah, who was as tall as her. Did this little child know that she was the cat?</span></p><p><span style="">Currently, they both looked like little girls.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I was thinking about how I should decorate this place.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Ah-ha.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Do you know what an aircraft carrier is, Sooah?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Aircraft carrier?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Sooah tilted her head in confusion. &#xA0;She was barely a kindergartner, so maybe the word was too difficult for her. &#xA0;Sooah had become the Holy Maiden of earth&apos;s unknown goddess, yet this didn&#x2019;t mean her knowledge had expanded.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I know what aircraft means.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Aircraft?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;It is a more difficult word, but it has the same meaning as a plane.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Ah ha. &#xA0;So that is why they call it an aircraft carrier.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Bibi looked at the wide deck as she nodded her head.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;No wonder.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">So that&apos;s what an aircraft carrier was.</span></p><p><span style="">Aircraft was a plane.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;So that&apos;s why it is called an aircraft carrier. &#xA0;I wonder what carrier means?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Bibi tilted her head in puzzlement.</span></p><p><span style="">She used her authority over the Colony to search through the Store. &#xA0;She needed an expert that would be able to renovate this rundown Colony city.</span></p><p><span style="">&lt;Nosam&gt; - 1,400p</span></p><p><span style="">One of the Dwarf Engineers of the Black Mine tribe.</span></p><p><span style="">He is adept at creating magical machines.</span></p><p><span style="">Design Option - Flying Boat, Mechanical Golem, Tank...</span></p><p><span style="">Build Option - &#xA0;Siege type Vulcan Cannon, Offensive Buckshot...</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I found it!&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">She found the talent that&apos;ll renovate the aircraft carrier. &#xA0;Bibi didn&apos;t think twice about consuming the Points needed to appoint this talent.</span></p>
