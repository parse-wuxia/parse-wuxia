<p><strong>Chapter 71 To the US (3).</strong></p><div id="chapterContent" class="innerContent fr-view"><p><span style="">Chapter 70 &#x2013; To the US (3)</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p><p><span style="">(<span>TLN: Hey guys. I worked hard to get this out tonight.?? This is the regular chapter for next week. Please turn off the adblockers if you are able to. Thank you~)</span></span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Mr. Kahng-woojin, who is the most popular man right now, came to see our movie. It is really an honor.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">At Cindy&#x2019;s words, everyone inside the theater turned to look at him. Kahng-woojin let out a bitter smile as he looked at Cindy.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;If you don&#x2019;t mind me asking, could I bring you up to the front of the stage?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">At Cindy&#x2019;s words, a staff rapidly approached Woojin. The staff spoke as he bowed towards the audiences sitting close to Woojin.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Excuse me. Please move for a brief moment. Yes. Excuse me.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The people sitting next to Woojin all stood up, and they moved into the aisle. They made way, so Woojin could come out. The staff approached Woojin, and he spoke.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Please come this way.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;</span></p><p><span style="">I do mind, so fuck off.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">If she already knew she was being a bother then she should have left him alone. Why did she have to annoy him by asking him a favor?</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Tell her I said hello and to fuck off. I&#x2019;m starting to get annoyed.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;T&#x2026;that is&#x2026;&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Are my words insufficient?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">When Woojin started gathering his magic, the staff member started feeling a threatening energy, so he started backing off.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I&#x2026;I&#x2019;ll deliver the message.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The staff member quickly approached Cindy to deliver Woojin&#x2019;s words. The theater was quiet, so everyone heard what was being said. The director laughed as he grabbed the microphone.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Haha. I&#x2019;m sorry for making you wait. I&#x2019;m sure his rebuttal means he really wants to watch our movie as soon as possible. Please have fun. Enjoy the movie.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">After a brief farewell, the director and actors exited the stage. Everyone kept sneaking glances towards Woojin. Jiwon whispered into Woojin&#x2019;s ear.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;It seems Cindy doesn&#x2019;t know she graduated from the same high school as you.</span></p><p><span style="">Well, it was likely she had no idea.</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin didn&#x2019;t know Cindy, and Cindy didn&#x2019;t know Woojin.</span></p><p><span style="">The movie was quite entertaining.</span></p><p><span style="">The Roused used magic. They showed abilities that was impossible in real life.</span></p><p><span style="">They were very expensive to hire, but a movie casting the Roused didn&#x2019;t need special effects or CG. They could film everything on the spot.</span></p><p><span style="">They were Rank F and Rank E Roused hired professionally for these works.</span></p><p><span style="">They didn&#x2019;t make a lot of money, but not everyone wanted to risk their life for a large income.</span></p><p><span style="">When the movie ended, it was close to the appointed time.</span></p><p><span style="">Since the weather was getting chilly, people were wearing a thick layer of clothes. Woojin suddenly realized Jiwon was wearing a very worn coat.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Didn&#x2019;t you say before that you have some debts?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ah. I paid it all off. I received my severance pay.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hmmm. If you need some help, just tell me.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Eh-ee. You don&#x2019;t need to help me. I&#x2019;ve already received too much from you.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">She owed him an incalculable debt from the fact that he had restored her face.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What&#x2019;s Jaemin doing these days?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;His college entrance exam is right around the corner, so he is really busy. He is taking his studies really seriously these days.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Is that so? I guess he got past the shock.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Huh? Shock?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;The girl he liked entered a trainee program for entertainers. He made a big scene. He cried a lot.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Huh. Jaemin said that?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;You didn&#x2019;t know?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">This was the first time Jiwon heard about this. She had thought there were no secrets between her sibling. She was a little bit disappointed that he didn&#x2019;t tell her what had happened.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;So that is why he is study so hard these days&#x2026;.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Haha. There aren&#x2019;t any downside if he studies hard.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin decided he should meet with Jaemin after he took his college entrance exam. He always talked about entering a guild, so he&#x2019;ll let Jaemin enter his guild.</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin followed Jiwon to the appointed grilled meat restaurant.</span></p><p><span style="">They were led to a room reserved to Nahm-jihyuhk, but no one had arrived yet. After a brief amount of time, Nahm-jihyuhk and Park-soojin opened the door, and they carefully entered the room.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Soojin.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;J&#x2026;Jiwon!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Park-soojin was her friend who had kept in contact with Jiwon until the end. Since Jiwon had been busy with her factory work, she was rarely able to keep in touch with Soojin, so they had become estranged.</span></p><p><span style="">When Woojin cleared the Dungeon in Daegoo, Soojin saw the article with the picture of Jiwon kissing Woojin. Soojin had recognized her, and she had tried to get a hold of Jiwon again.</span></p><p><span style="">When Soojin saw Jiwon&#x2019;s face, she started crying.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Good for you. Girl! You are all better now. You are whole.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ooh-oong. I&#x2019;m all good now.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hoo-hook. Good. That&#x2019;s really good.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Soojin started crying from genuine happiness, and it made Jiwon&#x2019;s eyes well up with tears. It was as if separated family members had reunited after a long time. They hugged each other as they cried with runny noses. Nahm-jihyuk felt awkard by the scene, so he approached Woojin.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;It&#x2026;it&#x2019;s been awhile?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The friend he had thought was dead when Woojin went missing had suddenly shown up after 5 years. Moreover, he was one of the top Roused in the world, and the media covered him daily.</span></p><p><span style="">He used to worry about the college entrance exam with Woojin. They used to study and play Chaos together. Only 5 years had passed, but his friend had become someone amazing.</span></p><p><span style="">Jihyuhk couldn&#x2019;t help being awkward and he was mindful of how he acted around Woojin.</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin was meeting his friend after 20 years&#x2026;.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;You&#x2019;re here?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">He wordlessly raised his glass.</span></p><p><span style="">Ggol ggol.</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin smiled as he filled the glass. He thought he wouldn&#x2019;t recognize anyone since it had been 20 years. He dimly remembered some names, but everything was fuzzy.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Nahm-jihyuhk. I remember him.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin recognized his face. He had seen his friend&#x2019;s face in 20 years, and couple memories from his third year in high school started surfacing.</span></p><p><span style="">He was happy.</span></p><p><span style="">He was so happy that he wanted to cry.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;How have you been?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Dude. What have you been up to before you suddenly fell out of the sky? I was so surprised when I saw you on TV.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin treated Jihyuhk in a relaxed manner. Jihyuhk started to grin when his nervousness dissipated.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hey, let&#x2019;s have a drink.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">All of his classmates from Mido High school was gathered here.</span></p><p><span style="">There were friends he was close to during his high school days, and there were those he only remembered by their faces. However, this moment was very precious to him.</span></p><p><span style="">It felt as if the Immortal of Alphen was turning back into Kahng-woojin of earth.</span></p><p><span style="">He wouldn&#x2019;t be lying if he said he would be satisfied if he was struck dead right now.</span></p><p><span style="">His family was here, and now he had friends here.</span></p><p><span style="">He wouldn&#x2019;t mind dying in battle now. There were people who will remember him&#x2026;</span></p><p><span style="">He wouldn&#x2019;t have any regret even if he died. However, he wanted to live much more now.</span></p><p><span style="">He wanted to protect his family and friends, who remembered him.</span></p><p><span style="">He hadn&#x2019;t fought tooth and nail to surive, so he could just return to earth.</span></p><p><span style="">The war to protect everyone was just starting.</span></p><p><span style="">When the meat and alcohol started coming out, the atmosphere turned mellow.</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin listened to old stories about his life from his friends, and it was great.</span></p><p><span style="">He felt warm, and cozy when he started dwelling on his old memories.</span></p><p><span style="">He was happy as if he was a babe in his mother&#x2019;s bosom.</span></p><p><span style="">For a moment, he escaped from his worries about Trahnet and the Dungeon Break. He felt as if he was in a dream for a brief time.</span></p><p><span style="">*</span></p><p><span style="">After they parted from their friends, Jiwon and Woojin walked the night streets together.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ha. It was great.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin let out a breath, and the happiness could be heard in his voice.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I&#x2019;m glad you liked it.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Jiwon also smiled. It felt as if she repaid a small portion of the kindness she had received from him.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I guess we&#x2019;ll meet more of our friends at the end of the year, right?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I guess so.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Jiwon didn&#x2019;t meet as many friends as Woojin. There was an alumni reunion at the end of the year, and she was already looking forward to it.</span></p><p><span style="">A person, who kept glancing at Woojin and Jiwon in the street, approached them with a pen and a paper.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Mr. Kahng-woojin. I&#x2019;m a fan. Please sign this for me.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;&#x2026;.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin looked back dumbly, and the people in the surrounding rushed towards him.</span></p><p><span style="">One person after another continuously stepped up towards him.</span></p><p><span style="">Even if they took home the paper with signature, it was of no use. However, everyone still tried to get a signature from him.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I&#x2019;m not a celebrity, so why should I sign this?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Aren&#x2019;t you a public figure?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Why don&#x2019;t you get out of the way? You are being annoying.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">At Woojin&#x2019;s cold response, the people crowding around him hesitated.</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin started walking, and the people made way for him. He escaped from the crowd while he led Jiwon by her hand.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Chet. What the hell?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Can a public figure act like that?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin stopped walking when he heard the people whisper behind his back. He was about to turn around and say something, but Jiwon grabbed Woojin&#x2019;s arm.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Let&#x2019;s just go.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hoo.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">He shook his head. Woojin started walking again as he looked at Jiwon. Was he too emotional right now since he met his high school friends? He became angry at the whispers he would usally ignore.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I&#x2019;ll have to buy a car.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Huh?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Yes. That will be for the best. Since he can&#x2019;t wipe out the people in the street, he&#x2019;ll just have to avoid them.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;You don&#x2019;t have a driver&#x2019;s license?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Nope. I don&#x2019;t have one.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;&#x2026;.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin was summoned during his 3rd year in high school. There was no way he would have a driver&#x2019;s license.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I guess I&#x2019;ll have to get a driver&#x2019;s license first.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin took hold of Jiwon&#x2019;s hand and they walked the streets.</span></p><p><span style="">*</span></p><p><span style="">One week passed by quickly.</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin went around to gather information about setting up a cafe for his bored mother. In the evenings, he set aside time to play with Sooah. Sooah, who had felt a bit awkward at his presence, started to slowly open her heart. It warmed his heart.</span></p><p><span style="">Sunggoo soloed 3 star Dungeons during the day, and at night, he went to the 5 star Dungeon owned by Alandal with Woojin. He also made appointments for 5 star and 6 star Dungeons owned by other guilds. It was advantageous to spend the night inside the Dungeon since time ran 4 time longer insdie. It was better to sleep briefly inside the Dungeon to relieve the mental fatigue.</span></p><p><span style="">Sunggoo diligently ate Reinforcement Stones, and he continued to learn various Skills. He also learned how to deal with variety of monsters. He came up with various battle tactics using his magic and skills.</span></p><p><span style="">It had been only a week, but he had spent a much longer time inside the Dungeon. It was enough time to allow the Roused Hong-sunggoo to turn from Rank C to Rank B.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hyung-nim! I changed it.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">He proudly displayed his Roused Registration card, which had changed to Rank B. Woojin grinned when he saw Sunggoo.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Too bad. I planned on going to the US after I raised you up to Rank A.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;No, hyung-nim.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Sunggoo&#x2019;s voice trembled from being overwhelmed by his emotions.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I&#x2019;m a Rank B now. This all thanks to hyung-nim&#x2019;s teaching&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Don&#x2019;t enter anything above 4 star.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Of course, hyung-nim.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Sunggoo had soloed 4 star Dungeons several times under the administration of Woojin. Sunggoo thought he could solo 4 star Dungeons with no problem, but the future wasn&#x2019;t set in stone.</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin held up a fist-sized red gem. Sunggoo&#x2019;s eyes turned round when he received it.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;H&#x2026;hyung-nim! Isn&#x2019;t this a Return Portal?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Don&#x2019;t die because you got cute. If you are in danger, just come out.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;H&#x2026;hyung-nim.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">He had easily gave up a rare 10 million dollar item to him&#x2026; Sunggoo looked like he was about to cry.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;You&#x2019;ve developed into something useful, so it would be a loss if you die now.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Ah. He was always like this in touching situations&#x2026; Sunggoo knew his indifferent words was different from what Woojin felt.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Don&#x2019;t die a pointless death. I&#x2019;ve invested a lot of money in you. If you die, wouldn&#x2019;t it have all been a waste? How wasteful would that be?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;&#x2026;.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">He was almost sure Woojin&#x2019;s real feeling was warm&#x2026;.</span></p><p><span style="">Still, Woojin had invested couple million into Sunggoo. The Reinforcement Stones, Artifacts, and Skill books he had used&#x2026; Moreover, the ring on Sunggo&#x2019;s finger was a sub-dimension Artifact able to store 3 items. It was worth around 3 million dollars.</span></p><p><span style="">The Return Portal was like a lifeline. Sunggoo put the item into his sub-dimension.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Then keep up the good work.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Heh hehe. I&#x2019;ll accompany you to the airport.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;It&#x2019;s alright. Just go clear a Dungeon.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Heh hehe.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Sunggoo was still giddy from becoming a Rank B Roused, so he kept laughing for no reason. Woojin and Minchan got on the taxi.</span></p><p><span style="">If Woojin went alone, he would get into all kinds of trouble. Woojin didn&#x2019;t know anything about the consortium, so Minchan would accompany him to take care of the Alandal&#x2019;s business. Woojin was just here to meet the Holy maiden.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Have you been to the US, Minchan?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I&#x2019;ve been there 3 times.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Mmmm.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Have you been there, president?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Nope.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">This was the first time Woojin was riding a plane, let alone visiting the US. After a momentary silence, a cheerful song rang out inside the taxi.</span></p><p><span style="">[The only thing I want is your ph.one.num.ber!]</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes. This is Alandal&#x2019;s Jung-minchan.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">After picking up the call, Minchan started speaking in a serious manner.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes. Yes. I will do so. Thank you for giving us a heads up.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What? Who is it?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">After ending the call, Minchan spoke with a serious expression on his face.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;It&#x2019;s a call from the Ministry of National Defense. They were tipped off on a terrorist attack.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Is that so? What about it?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;President. It seems you are their target&#x2026;.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Me? Why are they targeting me?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Minchan didn&#x2019;t know what to say when Woojin asked the question in such an oblivious manner. Woojin had made a lot of enemies recently. Woojin just shrugged his shoulders at Minchan&#x2019;s serious expression.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I guess they want to entertain me since the road to the US is boring.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;&#x2026;.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">It would be a problem if he was joking. It would also be a problem if he meant those words.</span></p><p><span style="">Minchan secretly let out a sigh.</span></p><p></p></div><p></p>
