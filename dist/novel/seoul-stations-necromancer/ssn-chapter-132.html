<p><span style="">Chapter 132 - Bloody Reunion (2)</span></p><p><span style="">The Chaos mountain was the tallest mountain on Planet Jaku.</span></p><p><span style="">It was the base of the biggest power on Planet Jaku. &#xA0;They were the Yellow Lizards, and all the Dimensional lords affiliated with the organization was holding a meeting. &#xA0;There were a total of eight of them. &#xA0;They were all diverse in their appearance. </span></p><p><span style="">There was a road with large columns lining each side. &#xA0;There were Dimensional lords present on top of each column, and they looked down at the human, who was walking down the road.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yo-ho-ho. &#xA0;That human is the messenger sent by the Great lord Iello-nim?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;He&apos;s pathetic. &#xA0;At a glance, he is a disposable item.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Lee-sahngho &#xA0;could clearly hear their conversations, but he made no comments. &#xA0;No, he didn&apos;t dare to speak.</span></p><p><span style="">On top of the tall columns, there was a Titan, who was over 10 meters tall, and other grotesque beings of unknown races.</span></p><p><span style="">There were also those, who looked akin to humans, but the oppressive feeling they let out was no joke.</span></p><p><span style="">Lee-sahngho felt their attention on him. &#xA0;His legs shook from the strain.</span></p><p><span style="">After passing the road lined with the giant columns, one came upon a tower.</span></p><p><span style="">This was the highest location on the peak of Chaos mountain.</span></p><p><span style="">Koo-roo-roo. </span></p><p><span style="">Rajakui, the Gold Dragon, took rough breaths as he appeared.</span></p><p><span style="">[What does a messenger of Iello-nim want with me?] </span></p><p><span style="">Iello&apos;s messenger Lee-sahngho felt a bit faint when he heard the voice ring inside his head.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;If you destroy earth, he will allow you entrance into the Planet Iferin.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">[Koo-koo-koo. &#xA0;Iferin.] </span></p><p><span style="">Rajakui&apos;s body shook at the sentimental name. He alternated between being happy and angry. &#xA0;The Dragon&apos;s Fear raged forward. &#xA0;The gathered Dimensional lords all got on their knees as they endured the Dragon&apos;s Fear.</span></p><p><span style="">Lee-sahngho felt faint, and he felt like passing out. &#xA0;He was barely able to resist, and his body was frozen in place. &#xA0;If he was in a battle, he would have been cut down without being able to do anything.</span></p><p><span style="">[Do you have anything else to say to me?] </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Please send me to earth.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">[That won&apos;t be difficult.] </span></p><p><span style="">Rajakui opened his wings wide.</span></p><p><span style="">The fully extended wings was over 50 meters long. The body between the wings was also incredibly large. &#xA0;The Dimensional lords stretched their necks to look up at him.</span></p><p><span style="">[We&apos;ll take over earth.] </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Then what are we going to do about this planet?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">There were two other coalitions on the Planet Jaku other than the Yellow Lizard coalition. &#xA0;There was the Black Hats and the Red Hammer. &#xA0;If they lost the initiative on keeping this planet, their profits would suffer. &#xA0;However, they had to expend a considerable amount of resources to be able to co-exist with the two other coalitions on this planet.</span></p><p><span style="">[We&apos;ll move and make earth our main hunting ground.] </span></p><p><span style="">This was a planet where they hadn&apos;t even completed their links. </span></p><p><span style="">The risk was high, but the reward was as big as the risk. He had a goal where the sacrifice would be worth it.</span></p><p><span style="">A road that lead back to his home planet of Iferin was open to him now.</span></p><p><span style="">*** </span></p><p><span style="">A van stopped in front of the Mokdong Station.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;We are here, president.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">When he heard Soonghoon&apos;s words, Woojin opened his eyes, and he pulled up his reclined seat.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;It&apos;s at least a 6 star?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Mokdong Station&apos;s 4th exit.</span></p><p><span style="">The Dungeon had Reset 7 days ago, but no one had attempted to clear it yet.</span></p><p><span style="">KH guid had the priority to clear it, since they had found it first. &#xA0;However, when they measured the Dungeon Energy, it was higher than the energy measured for the 6 star Dungeons. &#xA0;They couldn&apos;t readily send in their Rank A Roused team inside.</span></p><p><span style="">They could try to clear it with an Escape Return Portal in possession, but the Item was pricey. &#xA0;They could gather their dream team, but they decided to grant Alandal&apos;s request instead.</span></p><p><span style="">There was still a lot of time until the Dungeon Break, but Woojin was going to clear the Dungeon. Of course, the guilds would determine how they would split the profit.</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin just needed a place to hunt. </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I&apos;ll be here all day. &#xA0;Go eat in shifts.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes, sir. &#xA0;Don&apos;t worry about us. &#xA0;We&apos;ll be on strict watch.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;All right. Thanks.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Woojin patted Soonghoon&apos;s shoulder, then he headed towards the Dungeon.</span></p><p><span style="">&lt;You&apos;ve entered Mivich&apos;s Meadow.&gt; </span></p><p><span style="">&lt;Please select a mode from &apos;Duel&apos;, &apos;Dimensional Battle&apos;, &apos;Visit&apos;, &#x2018;Infiltration&#x2019; or &#x2018;Clear&#x2019;.&gt; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;As I thought, another Dimensional lord is here.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Most of the Dungeons that were 6 stars and below was owned by the Dungeon Owners. &#xA0;Any Dungeons exceeded the amount of Energy held by the 6 star Dungeon were almost always owned by the Dimensional lords.</span></p><p><span style="">This was also the case here.</span></p><p><span style="">Since Dimensional lords were trying to link to earth worldwide, it was a matter of time before one of them connected.</span></p><p><span style="">Of course, he could clear the Dungeon to sever the link, but in the meantime, he was afraid the Dimensional lord&apos;s vassals would cause crimes against humanity.</span></p><p><span style="">They were on a different level compared to the mediocre Roused or the monsters. &#xA0;If Woojin hadn&apos;t chased out Juliel and Rashmode, the demise of Earth would be much closer right now.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What the hell?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Woojin walked through the empty subway station, and he tilted his head in confusion. &#xA0;Either there hadn&apos;t been any Energy invested into the Dungeon or there weren&#x2019;t any monsters available to be regenerated. &#xA0;He didn&apos;t even have to go downstairs to check the lower floors.</span></p><p><span style="">Zzeeeeeng, zzeeeeeeng. </span></p><p><span style="">The sound of resonance rang out as a portal emitting red light was formed.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Does this mean he doesn&apos;t need to use the scrubs?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">The dispatch of monsters inside the Dungeon acted as a first line of defense. &#xA0;This mechanism allowed one to prove to a certain extent that one was qualified to step onto the Dimensional Domain.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">Of course, this all depended on the preference of the Dimensional lords. &#xA0;Instead of dispatching monsters in the Dungeon, the Dimensional lord could have gathered all his forces into his Dimensional Domain.</span></p><p><span style="">When Woojin passed through the portal, he saw a green grassland.</span></p><p><span style="">There were gentle hills that made it hard to see far into the distance. He climbed the highest hill he could find to look around his surroundings. </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Why is this place so deserted?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Woojin shook his head from side to side when he couldn&apos;t&apos; find a single monster on the land.</span></p><p><span style="">Was this an owner, who preferred to have a small elite force?</span></p><p><span style="">The recorded Dungeon Energy was very high, and the total amount of fight power the lord would have wouldn&apos;t change.</span></p><p><span style="">Either there would be a lot of monsters or there would be a few powerful monsters.</span></p><p><span style="">He might have gotten unlucky this time, and it was the latter situation.</span></p><p><span style="">As a Necromancer, it was much easier to face a lot of mediocre enemies rather than fighting an absolute power.</span></p><p><span style="">He wouldn&apos;t be able to turn the corpses into allied forces, and he wouldn&apos;t be able to use the corpses as medium for the Corpse Explosion.</span></p><p><span style="">However, it wasn&apos;t as if he was helpless against strong foes.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Rakto.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">The black smoke coalesced, and the Death Knight named Rakto appeared. &#xA0;Rakto was the one that used a ghost-like spear.</span></p><p><span style="">[My lord.] </span></p><p><span style="">This particular Death Knight was almost equal to Kiba in terms of one-on-one battles. &#xA0;He was also unparalleled in terms of fighting on a mount. There was a chance an intruder might infiltrate his Dimensional Domain of Alandal, so he wouldn&apos;t be able to summon all of this Death Knights.</span></p><p><span style="">If a being from the Planet Jaku cleared Necia&apos;s Pillar before he could sync it, he would lose his Dungeon.</span></p><p><span style="">If the hunt was difficult, he decided he would call up 20 Death Knights.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Let&apos;s go as a duo.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">[As you command.] </span></p><p><span style="">Woojin and Rakto summoned their Phantom Steeds. &#xA0;Woojin summoned his Warrior&apos;s Weapon, and he transformed it into a spear. &#xA0;They raced across the grasslands. &#xA0;Their destination was obvious. &#xA0;It was the green colored pillar of light in the distance. &#xA0;That was where the Return Stone was present.</span></p><p><span style="">*** </span></p><p><span style="">In front of the Mokdong Station&apos;s 4th exit.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ah-ooh. &#xA0;It&apos;s cold.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Chief. &#xA0;I think we picked up a reporter.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What? Where?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Woo-soonghoon looked around his surrounding, and he saw a parked car with a man holding up a camera with long lens. He grinned as he shook his head from side to side.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Just let him be. This isn&apos;t the first time that has happened.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes. &#xA0;Is it really ok to travel like this?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Huh? What do you mean?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;We haven&apos;t gained our independence yet. &#xA0;Moreover, we are on Korean soil....&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Soonghoon put his arm around the employee&apos;s shoulder.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hey. &#xA0;Do you think we are North Korea? &#xA0;Does a country always have to be in war with a neighboring country?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ah.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Moreover, the treaty hasn&apos;t been signed yet. &#xA0;We are still citizens of South Korea..&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">As Soonghoon had said, they were still Koreans. &#xA0;They would just gain an additional citizenship into Alandal. &#xA0;Basically, they would be dual citizens. When the national vote changed the Constitution of South Korea, the details of the treaty would be finalized.</span></p><p><span style="">The fact that Alandal was a country sounded good, but it would basically be like how Rome operated alongside the Vatican city.</span></p><p><span style="">It would allow Korean citizens to enter the guild, and it would also given them the right to become the citizens of Alandal.</span></p><p><span style="">When one leaves the guild, it would strip the rights one would have in Alandal.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Uh-whew. &#xA0;My head hurts thinking about the legal ramifications. &#xA0;Let&apos;s rest a little bit.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes. I&apos;ll go buy something to eat.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;All right.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">The employee ran across to the street to the convenience store. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">Soonghoon walked towards the people from the KH guild guarding the Dungeon.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Uh-whew. &#xA0;It seems I&apos;ll be seeing you for all of today, so let&apos;s greet each other.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ah, yes.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Soonghoon&apos;s rank wasn&apos;t low. &#xA0;He was one of Alandal&apos;s founding members, and he was the Chief Secretary working directly under Woojin. There was a rumor saying that he was going to be nominated as Alandal&apos;s minister of foreign affairs. &#xA0;To the rank and file employees, he was someone way above them.</span></p><p><span style="">The people from the KH guild awkwardly gave their greetings, and Soonghoon started chatting them up for a long time. &#xA0;He was in the midst of talking, while eating the cup ramen and kimbab brought to him by an employee, when he suddenly had a thought. &#xA0;He looked down at his watch.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Uh? Why isn&apos;t he so late in coming out?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I know. &#xA0;If we consider president&apos;s playing time, he is excessively late in coming out.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hmmm&#x2026;.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Soonghoon furrowed his brows when he felt a weird sense of uneasiness.</span></p><p><span style="">This was a first clear of a Dungeon, but Woojin showed an almost miraculous ability to clear the Dungeons. &#xA0;He should have already been out by now. &#xA0;It had been 6 hours since he had entered the Dungeon. &#xA0;A full day should have passed inside.</span></p><p><span style="">This had never happened before. Soonhoon looked at the firmly closed barrier with a little bit of concern.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Uh? There&apos;s a breaking news.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Huh? Put up the volume.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">An employee had been watching tv through his handphone. &#xA0;At Soonghoon&apos;s words, he unplugged the earphone, and he raised the volume.</span></p><p><span style="">-There is a simultaneous Dungeon Reset happening right now. &#xA0;Currently, there are 11 locations in Seoul, four locations in Daegoo, and seven in Busan. In total, 20 new Dungeons have formed. &#xA0;When the Energy was measured, eight of them exceeded what one would measure from a 6 star Dungeon....</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Soonghoon quickly took out his smartphone, and he accessed the internet.</span></p><p><span style="">The Dungeon Resets were happening at random. &#xA0;Numerous Dungeons had reset in a short amount of time. He was taken aback, since something big might be going on right now.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Huh. It isn&apos;t only happening in Korea?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">The internet was in more of an uproar than the news.</span></p><p><span style="">US, Japan and China were all experiencing a simultaneous Dungeon Reset.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Oh no. An additional three Dungeons were added in Seoul.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What the hell? Is something big about to happen?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">The employees whispered to each other in unease.</span></p><p><span style="">The Guilds jockeyed to claim the Reset Dungeons, because the number of Dungeons that Reset was low. However, they were all Resetting at the same time....</span></p><p><span style="">A weird sense of danger and worry washed over Soonghoon.</span></p><p><span style="">Since he was worried, Soonghoon looked for him.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;President&#x2026;.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Why was Kahng-woojin taking so long to clear the Dungeon? &#xA0;This was abnormal, and Soonghoon could only look on with a worried expression.</span></p><p><span style="">*** </span></p><p><span style="">A pale looking man was hurriedly walking down the streets of Hongdae.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Huh-uhk, huhk.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">He looked to be hurt, and the man kept looking around his surrounding as if he was being chased by someone. &#xA0;The light within his eyes shook.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Is this for real?&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">The knowledge that was in his mind was too vivid to call it a delusion.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;If you do as I say, Haeyun will live.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">He was merely a Rank E Roused. This might be god&apos;s mercy, and this was god attempting to fix his ailing daughter.</span></p><p><span style="">He didn&apos;t care if this was god&apos;s grace or a devil&apos;s temptation. &#xA0;He just wanted his sick Haeyun to be healed.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;I have to do it.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">He didn&apos;t have any alternatives.</span></p><p><span style="">The man slowly headed towards the entrance of the Hongdae station.</span></p><p><span style="">The 1st exit was just Reset, so the police was guarding it. The place was bustling as the Roused Bureau was measuring the Dungeon Energy.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Uh uh? Please step back. &#xA0;It&apos;s dangerous here.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">When the policeman took his eyes off the man, he rushed forward.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Uh uh? Who is that? Detain him!&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Before the alerted policemen could give chase, the man had already entered the Dungeon. &#xA0;It almost looked as if he had rolled down the stairs.</span></p>
