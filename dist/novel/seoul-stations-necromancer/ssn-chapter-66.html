<p><strong>Chapter 66 Unexpected Loot (2).</strong></p><div id="chapterContent" class="innerContent fr-view"><p><span style="">Chapter 66 &#x2013; Unexpected Loot (2)</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p><p><span style="">(<span>TLN: This is a sponsored chapter. Late night ninja release! Queue is cleared. Thank you Ayed, Vincent and Erick for the donation. Please turn off adblockers if you are able to. Thanks and enjoy.)</span></span></p><p><span style="">Woojin walked out of the underground tunnel.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Please stop!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Somehow, Che-haesol had found Woojin. She ran towards him, and she blocked his path. She was still grimacing as if the pain hadn&#x2019;t subsided yet.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Please stop. It isn&#x2019;t too late. We can still mend this.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Che-haesol meant what she said. A war would erupt if events continued to progress like this. She had to prevent such an event from happening. Che-haesol spoke with utmost sincerity.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;This isn&#x2019;t the way. Please stop.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">She really felt that way. A war meant tens of thousands of people would have to sacrifice their lives. She wanted to stop such an appalling tragedy from happening at all cost.</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin looked at her with a non-committal expression.</span></p><p><span style="">Haesol studied Woojin&#x2019;s expression, and the light in her eyes shook.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;N&#x2026;no way!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">He had already made a mess. Kim-jungun was dead.</span></p><p><span style="">Strength left her legs. Ah, another blood storm will rage.</span></p><p><span style="">She had made a mistake. She shouldn&#x2019;t have asked Guild Alandal to clear Pyongyang&#x2019;s 6 star Dungeon.</span></p><p><span style="">Haesol was in a daze as she flopped down on the floor. Woojin secretly smiled when he saw this.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;He isn&#x2019;t dead yet.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Really? You did well&#x2026; Yet? Are you still planning on killing him?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Haesol swallowed her saliva.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Well, I&#x2019;ll see what happens.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin wanted to see how they took care of the person, who ordered the suicide bombing.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Please hold yourself back. If you anger isn&#x2019;t quelled, then I&#x2019;ll give you my life instead. I mean it.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">From her sitting position, she got on her knees.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Really?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;The war of the Korean Peninsula may never end. It has been less than 100 years since the last war. This land shouldn&#x2019;t have to go through such a tragedy again. If you would be satisfied from just taking my life&#x2026;&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">No. She wasn&#x2019;t worried about the conflict turning into a world war, but this war would be held on the Korean peninsula. Her beloved country would be ruined, so wouldn&#x2019;t giving up her own life be well worth the price of stopping this war?</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin narrowed his eyes as he looked at Haesol. She didn&#x2019;t have a blemish-free soul. It wasn&#x2019;t like Jiwon&#x2019;s clear and innocent soul. However, this was the first time he had seen such a shiny soul on earth.</span></p><p><span style="">It meant her will was filled with sincerity. She wasn&#x2019;t lying when she said she&#x2019;ll offer up her life.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Lieutenant Che-haesol.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;You really are forfeiting your life to me?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Of course. If I could stop this disaster from spreading, I will.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">If Kim-jungun was still alive then they could still cover this up. Woojin shrugged when he saw Haesol&#x2019;s sincerity.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;It would be wasteful to just kill you&#x2026; Discharge from the military.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Did I hear you wrong?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;After your discharge, come work under me. If you do that, I&#x2019;ll spare Jungun.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;&#x2026;.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Haesol&#x2019;s face was filled with conflict. Didn&#x2019;t she dream about becoming a genuine soldier?</span></p><p><span style="">At that moment, Woojin felt the presence of people approaching him. A group of people came out of the passageway.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hurry up and clean this up. Find where Ri-pyunggahn went.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin grinned when he heard Kim-jungun&#x2019;s voice.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Should I go catch that pig?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;I&#x2019;ll join your guild.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin&#x2019;s grin widened.</span></p><p><span style="">It was rare to find someone with Che-haesol&#x2019;s will and conviction. He had found an unexpected loot here. Woojin grinned as he walked away.</span></p><p><span style="">He knew where everything was inside the Memorial Palace, because of Ggaebi&#x2019;s memories. Now it was time to go rob Kim-jungun&#x2019;s collection.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Then you should go talk to patch up this situation.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;&#x2026;.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">What the hell? He had made such a mess yet he was able to easily ask her to patch this up&#x2026;.</span></p><p><span style="">Before the chaotic atmosphere settled down, Woojin quickly headed toward Kim-jungun&#x2019;s hobby room.</span></p><p><span style="">*</span></p><p><span style="">The next three days passed like a storm.</span></p><p><span style="">Ri-pyunggahn, and any one related to him were all captured. There were even some innocent people who were lumped in with them. The delegation from South Korea left as they let Kim-jungun take care of those men.</span></p><p><span style="">Kim-jungun was shaking from anger.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;You are a dead man! How dare you steal the treasures soaked in our people&#x2019;s blood and sweat? You took the future of our republic? Bastard!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Chairman&#x2026; I really don&#x2019;t know&#x2026; I really don&#x2019;t know anything about it&#x2026;.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;You still dare to lie? Punish them until they speak.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Understood.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Ri-pyunggahn was suspended by his arms like a piece of meat at a butcher&#x2019;s shop. The interrogators approached him, and they started whipping him. Kim-jungun looked on with cold eyes as he tried to quell his anger.</span></p><p><span style="">The treasures he had gathered with the blood and sweat of his people were all gone. The only thing left was the picture he took with Kahng-woojin, and his signature&#x2026; Kim-jungun&#x2019;s wrath was great since someone robbed him of everything.</span></p><p><span style="">He had gathered his collection for the past 5 years.</span></p><p><span style="">The only person he suspected was Ri-pyunggahn. He was probably planning his betrayal for a long time. He was probably planning on blaming it on the visiting South Korean delegation&#x2026;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;If it wasn&#x2019;t for comrade Kahng-woojin, I might have been in big trouble.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">He hadn&#x2019;t died. Kahng-woojin had survived, and Ri-pyunggahn&#x2019;s betrayal came out into the open.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;They had nothing to do with it.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">It wasn&#x2019;t as if he hadn&#x2019;t suspected the people from South Korea. However, they traveled here sharing just two cars. He didn&#x2019;t think that massive amount of treasure could be stolen by them.</span></p><p><span style="">The only Roused in the party was Rank AA Kahng-woojin, and Rank F Che-haesol.</span></p><p><span style="">Just in case they were using Artifacts, they were searched. They didn&#x2019;t find any sub-dimension Artifact. Even if they did find one, the Artifact could only hold a limited amount of items.</span></p><p><span style="">The best sub-dimension Artifact was owned by a Middle Eastern royal family, and it could only hold a 300 litre refrigerator. Massive amounts of treasure had disappeared, and it wouldn&#x2019;t fit inside a sub-dimensions.</span></p><p><span style="">So the only people who could pull this off was on the North Korean side.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Bastard. He is quite tenacious.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Kim-jungun gritted his teeth as Ri-pyunggahn failed to confess.</span></p><p><span style="">*</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;We&#x2019;ve arrived at the Pahnmunjum.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ooh ooh. We are finally here.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Haesol saved her words as Woojin stretched.</span></p><p><span style="">For the past 3 days, Woojin just lazed around as he slept. The negotiation team had to renegotiate the deal for the past 3 days.</span></p><p><span style="">After the betrayal within North Korea was resolved, South Korea&#x2019;s Kahng-woojin was reported to have taken an active role in all of the events.</span></p><p><span style="">It didn&#x2019;t matter what the truth was. South Korea&#x2019;s situation had improved.</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin had taken care of all the high ranked Roused in North Korea. North Korea didn&#x2019;t have enough force to even attempt the 6 star Dungeon.</span></p><p><span style="">They had removed China from the equation, so the relationship between the two nations turned for the worse. Russia wasn&#x2019;t an option either. Eventually, it was agreed that South Korea would run the Dungeon, and North Korea would share in the profit.</span></p><p><span style="">If one excluded the violence that erupted within Pyungyang, the end result was very good for South Korea. Woojin, the person in question, slept lazily inside the Memorial palace even though he was the one who had caused all the ruckus.</span></p><p><span style="">He even slept through the sounds of the firing squad for Ri-pyunggahn and his accomplices that erupted early in the morning.</span></p><p><span style="">Che-haesol didn&#x2019;t have a strong heart like Woojin, so she was nervous the whole time she stayed in North Korea. The angry atmosphere made the negotiations strenuous.</span></p><p><span style="">They passed the Panmunjum, so she was on South Korean soil. However, she couldn&#x2019;t relax yet.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I have something I want to ask you.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Speak.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Che-haesol didn&#x2019;t know when it happened, but Kahg-woojin spoke to her naturally in an informal manner.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Why did you hold back after giving the condition that I join Alandal?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin was bold enough to slap Hwarang&#x2019;s guild master on live tv. If she took his brute personality into consideration, it made her wonder about something. She knew if Woojin wanted to do something, then we wouldn&#x2019;t easily be deterred from his action.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What do you want to hear from me?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">At Woojin&#x2019;s response, Che-haesol scratched the back of her head. She was embarrassed to say what was on her mind now.</span></p><p><span style="">Did she want to hear praise from him? Did she want to hear about the worth of her ability?</span></p><p><span style="">Did she want him to talk about how she stopped him from killing North Korea&#x2019;s ultimate dictator?</span></p><p><span style="">Now that she thought about it in her head, she basically wanted to ask questions when she already knew the answers.</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin was looking out the window. Haesol watched the back of his head, and her face turned red from embarrassment.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;It&#x2019;s nothing.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Che-haesol cleared her throat in embarrassment. Woojin grinned.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;If you fill an organization with people with ability and worth, then the organization will run itself.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;&#x2026;.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">He didn&#x2019;t want back-biting in his guild.</span></p><p><span style="">He didn&#x2019;t want to supervise his underlings. He wanted people who will take care of the annoying and difficult works for him. This idea was very appealing to Woojin.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;You have worth. You are an outstanding individual with a lot of appeal..&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;&#x2026;.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">It made him want her as an underling, so he could order her around</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin retracted his gaze from the scenery outside the window, then he turned his head. He saw the young soldier&#x2019;s face, whose eyes were shaking from being moved by his words. She didn&#x2019;t cry, but her eyes were moist.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I will find you immediately after I am discharged.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Uh. You do that.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin decided not to tell her that he wasn&#x2019;t going to kill Kim-jongun in the first place.</span></p><p><span style="">*</span></p><p><span style="">Guild Alandal&#x2019;s Office.</span></p><p><span style="">The only large tv in the office was located inside the president&#x2019;s room, so the founding members were all gathered there. They were watching a tv special with the edited version of the breaking news that had occurred for the past three days.</span></p><p><span style="">They had turned the show on so much that they almost memorized the content of the news special.</span></p><p><span style="">They saw Woojin so much on tv that it didn&#x2019;t feel like he was absent from the office.</span></p><p><span style="">[Yes. If we compile all the new until now, it seems Ri-pyunggahn was the main figure who had staged a coup d&#x2019;etat. He was the commander of Supernatural Force of North Korea. What is your opinion on this?]</span></p><p><span style="">[The Roused abilities are like a double edged sword. The Roused transcends the human limitation, and they protect our country from the monsters. On the flip side, there are those who would participate in crimes. The Roused could be very dangerous to a regime like North Korea. The betrayal of a commander of the Supernatural Force puts the North Korean regime in a very dangerous situation.]</span></p><p><span style="">[Yes. It was Alandal&#x2019;s guild master who had cleared the the 6 star Dungeon. If it wasn&#x2019;t for President Kahng-wooojin, the coup d&#x2019;etat might have brought Kim-jungun&#x2019;s reign to an end. What are your opinions on this?]</span></p><p><span style="">[If a new figurehead with radical ideas had seized power in the North, then we would be in much more danger. President Kahng-woojin did a meritorious deed by helping keep the status quo of the relationship between the North and the South.]</span></p><p><span style="">[Will he receive a medal for this?]</span></p><p><span style="">[He&#x2019;ll get it. President Kahng-woojin&#x2019;s exploit rapidly mended the relationship between the North and the South&#x2026;]</span></p><p><span style="">[President Kahg-woojin&#x2019;s assault scandal hasn&#x2019;t been resolved yet. What do you think about&#x2026;.]</span></p><p><span style="">Ddi-rick.</span></p><p><span style="">When the members of the panel started repeating the same points again, Jung-minchan turned off the TV. Everyone faced each other with serious expressions on their faces.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;They are 100% right. Don&#x2019;t you all know about president&#x2019;s personality?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;&#x2026;.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">At Woo-soonghoon&#x2019;s words, everyone silently agreed.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;The story is coming into focus. Maybe our president threatened Kim-jungun? It was said that Ri-pyunggahn stole all the Artifacts gathered by North Korea. It sounds like something our president would do.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Kim-haemin questioned Woo-soonghoon&#x2019;s sharp conjecture.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Eh-ee. No way. Even if our president bends the rule a little bit, do you really think he will resort to stealing?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;You are being kind by saying he bends the rule a little bit. He is reckless.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Sunggoo spoke with a dissatisfied expression when he saw them bicker.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Well, this is the story of when I met president for the first time&#x2026;&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">He told them about Woojin killing Bae-dohsooh&#x2019;s party. The faces of the founding members darkened when Sunggoo described how Woojin had emptied the pockets of the dead people. Woo-soonghoon spoke with a smug expression on his face.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Wa. What did I tell you? I&#x2019;m really on to something here. We can&#x2019;t believe everything said in the media..&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Now that I think about it, he did say he wanted to assassinate Kim-jungun before the guild was formed&#x2026;&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Wah. See! What did I tell you? My arms has goosebumps. Ooh-wah.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">At Sunggoo&#x2019;s words, Woo-soonghoon spoke more forcefully.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Maybe president has already killed Kim-jungun.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Eh-ee. No way.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Didn&#x2019;t you say our president wanted to go kill him? He might have planned this visit to Pyungyang. Maybe he is from a patriotic household? I&#x2019;m sure he has bad feelings towards North Korea.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Eh-ee. President was just angry, because his conscription letter came&#x2026;&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Woo-sunghoon&#x2019;s eyebrows curved as he heard Sunggoo&#x2019;s words.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;He said such words from receiving a mere conscription letter? Wa. What does that have to do with&#x2026;&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Why would he want to assassinate Kim-jungun just from receiving a conscription letter?</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;He didn&#x2019;t want to join the army&#x2026;.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Wa. Look at the scale the president thinks in. Isn&#x2019;t this giving you guys goosebumps?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">He had wanted to kill a nation&#x2019;s dictator, because he didn&#x2019;t want to enlist in the army.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I wasn&#x2019;t going to say anything, since I don&#x2019;t hold a grudge. It isn&#x2019;t in my personality. However, this was when I used to sell hand phones&#x2026;.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Click.</span></p><p><span style="">Soonghoon&#x2019;s words ended when the door to the president&#x2019;s room opened.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;How have you guys been?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;&#x2026;.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Everyone froze when Woojin appeared. Woojin hadn&#x2019;t seen them for awhile, so he had a bright smile on his face.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What? What is it?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I thought president was having a banquet with the President?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What am I going to do at such an event? I wanted to have some soju with you guys.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Ah. How could he so easily break a promise made with the President?</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ah-oh. Why is my ears so itchy? Did someone speak badly behind my back?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">At Woojin&#x2019;s word, everyone&#x2019;s head reflexively turned towards Woo-soonghon. Woo-soonghoon&#x2019;s pupils shrank in a microsecond, and it shook. Woo-soonghoon suddenly stood up, and he started clapping his hand as he looked towards Woojin.</span></p><p><span style="">Zzahk, Zzahk, Zzahk!</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Let&#x2019;s clap for our president. He went through a lot of hardship, and he has returned as a hero. Thank you for your efforts! We are proud of you.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The reaction of the other people in the room was a bit slow. Woojin laughed. He narrowed his eyes as he watched Woo-soonghoon, who had spoken in an exaggerated manner.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I did. Didn&#x2019;t I?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Sweat started to perspire on Woo-soonghoon&#x2019;s forehead.</span></p><p></p></div><p></p>
