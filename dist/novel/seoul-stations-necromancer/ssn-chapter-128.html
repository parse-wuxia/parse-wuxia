<p><span style="">Chapter 128 - Dungeon Closer (3) </span></p><p><span style="">Only a handful of souls had left the corpses. &#xA0;The several thousand corpses reacted to Woojin&apos;s magic, and every ounce of magic within the corpses were squeezed out.</span></p><p><span style="">Kwahhhhhng! </span></p><p><span style="">Accompanying the sound of the explosion, which was ear splitting, Dread was vaporized. &#xA0;This allowed Woojin to gain a good chunk of EXP.</span></p><p><span style="">&lt;Level Up!&gt; </span></p><p><span style="">He only needed to level up four more times to reach level 80. &#xA0;The incredible explosion happened nearby, but the party was unharmed.</span></p><p><span style="">The deafening sound made their ears ring, but if one considered the size of the explosion, they had gotten of with minimal damage.</span></p><p><span style="">Zeeeeeeng. </span></p><p><span style="">A semi-transparent barrier had enveloped the party. It blocked the heat, sound and debris from the explosion. &#xA0;It blocked everything.</span></p><p><span style="">Blanka had his two hands raised as if he was holding up the sky. &#xA0;Then Blanka threw up some blood.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Kool-rook.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">He had overextended himself in his use of magic, so he tried to calm his twisted insides. He looked at Woojin with resentment in his eyes.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Couldn&apos;t you have warned us what would happen?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">He had been nervous at the appearance of Dread, so he had prepared his barrier. &#xA0;If he hadn&apos;t, they would have all been swept up into the explosion. &#xA0;However, Woojin just shrugged his shoulders.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;You didn&apos;t have to take action.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;&#x2026;.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Spirit Armor. </span></p><p><span style="">The Spirit Armor always hovered around Woojin. &#xA0;If there were any hint of danger, his barrier would form. &#xA0;He had risen to a level where he could block most explosions.</span></p><p><span style="">Of course, the party members near him would also be protected. Woojin didn&apos;t need anyone else to block for him. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin had said Blanka&#x2019;s actions were unnecessary, so he felt aggrieved.</span></p><p><span style="">Instead of being thankful, he....</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Uh-whew. &#xA0;You threw up all the delicious things you ate.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Tsk tsk. &#xA0;I told you to just watch.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Hong-sungoo and Baek-jungdoh scolded him, so Blanka felt like crying.</span></p><p><span style="">He had forgotten something. &#xA0;Everyone here were Rank A Roused.</span></p><p><span style="">They were Roused, who were arguably one of the best in the world. &#xA0;They all had the ability to protect their own lives, so he had had overstepped himself by stepping forward.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Isn&apos;t it reasonable for me to step forward?!&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">He wanted to yell those words, but he didn&apos;t have the energy to do so. &#xA0;His head was spinning. &#xA0;He was swaying unsteadily on his feet when an unknown energy suddenly entered his body.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hoo-ooh.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">His mind relaxed a little bit. &#xA0;He realized Woojin had used an unknown ability to bolster his energy.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;His abilities are endless...&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">He had Summoning skills, battle capabilities, magic and now healing.... &#xA0;He wondered how broad the spectrum of Woojin&apos;s skills was... &#xA0;He couldn&apos;t even guess at how many abilities Woojin possessed.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I&apos;m all right now. &#xA0;I can heal myself now.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Blanka indicated his thanks with his eyes, then he started to activate the magical energy that had just been stabilized. &#xA0;He assessed his own body.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Self Healing is pretty rare.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Woojin looked at him in fascination.</span></p><p><span style="">This man was a Buff Type Roused, yet he was also a Healing Mage. &#xA0;It seemed his ability didn&apos;t rely on Holy powers, so he was an oddity.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What&apos;s your name again?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;It&apos;s Blanka.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;You are fluent in Korean&#x2026; Did you say you are from the Vishnu Guild? &#xA0;How much do you receive from them?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Come to Alandal.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;&#x2026;.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Blanka reigned in the energy that was trying to churn once again, and he looked at Woojin. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">What was his game? &#xA0;He couldn&apos;t read anything from Woojin&apos;s eyes, yet it didn&apos;t seem like he was joking.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;What is this?&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">Even if this was a Dungeon Raid team that didn&apos;t feel any sense of crisis, how could he try to scout someone in such a situation? &#xA0;However, Blanka had no thoughts on changing his guild affiliation.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I&apos;m thankful for you words, but the guild master is my close friend. I&apos;ll bury my bones with the Vishnu guild.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Is that so? &#xA0;How unfortunate.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Woojin cleared his palate. &#xA0;When Blanka showed loyalty towards his guild, Woojin coveted him even more. &#xA0;Still, he didn&apos;t push the subject any further.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;That&apos;s too bad. Let&apos;s go conclude this.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Woojin put the table and chairs into his Inventory, then he started to move. The white beach was nowhere to be seen. &#xA0;Instead, the aftermath of the explosion left behind a huge lake.</span></p><p><span style="">The corpses and Bloodstones were all engulfed in the explosion, but he wasn&apos;t sorry for his actions.</span></p><p><span style="">In the middle of the lake, there was a purple gem. &#xA0;It was where Dread had died. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin stepped onto the water.</span></p><p><span style="">&lt;Air Walk&gt; </span></p><p><span style="">He used a Warrior Class skill that lightened one&apos;s body. &#xA0;His level was still too low to be able to walk across the sky, but he could easily walk across water.</span></p><p><span style="">Splosh. </span></p><p><span style="">His feet touched the water, but the water didn&apos;t reach above his ankles. Woojin walked across the water matter of factly, and he grabbed the gem.</span></p><p><span style="">&lt;You&apos;ve acquired a Dimensional Fragment.&gt; </span></p><p><span style="">Woojin grinned.</span></p><p><span style="">He finally acquired one. &#xA0;He could finally acquire a Dungeon that&apos;ll lead to Alphen.</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin put away the purple gem, then he walked across the sea towards Dread&apos;s underground palace. &#xA0;He looked below, and he could see the green light of the Return Stone. &#xA0;He retracted the energy that was maintaining the Air Walk.</span></p><p><span style="">At the same time, he activated a skill that increased his mass. &#xA0;He quickly sank to the bottom.</span></p><p><span style="">There were still several sea monsters alive, but he was able to ignore them easily. &#xA0;He took the Return Stone, and he shot out of the water.</span></p><p><span style="">Poo-hah.</span></p><p><span style="">He had invested all his Stats into Intellect and Magic, so his Energy was comparably weak. &#xA0;His previous actions had consumed all of his Energy. &#xA0;He couldn&apos;t reactivate the skill Air Walk and walk across the water.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Shing Shing.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Heeeeeng. </span></p><p><span style="">Woojin rode the summoned Shing Shing towards his party.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Let&apos;s go.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ehng? You aren&apos;t going to search for the treasures?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">This was the first Clear of this Dungeon, so there were a lot of Artifacts hidden here. &#xA0;Woojin shrugged his shoulder.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I can&apos;t stay underwater for a long time.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">The influence of the Warrior Class allowed him to boast an incredible lung capacity compared to a normal person, but he couldn&apos;t stay past the 10 minute mark underwater.</span></p><p><span style="">The sea was too large to use the Search Magic to find the location of the Artifacts.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I have a Buff that allows one to travel underwater without breathing.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Huh?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">At Blanka&apos;s words, everyone&apos;s attention was focused on him. &#xA0;It was especially true for Woojin. &#xA0;There was a strange sparkle in his eyes.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Isn&apos;t he quite useful?&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">If one only considered the Buff skills, Woojin had found someone in India, whose versatility was only second to him.</span></p><p><span style="">When they exited the Dungeon after safely clearing the Dungeon, a large group of people greeted the party. &#xA0;There were reporters from the Indian press, high ranking government employees, local bigwigs, people from the Vishnu guild, onlookers....</span></p><p><span style="">Normally, Woojin would have summoned his Phantom Steed to escape the crowd. &#xA0;He would have immediately disappeared towards the airport, but Woojin did something out of character. &#xA0;He got on the car that had been prepared for him.</span></p><p><span style="">The four people, who cleared the Dungeon, and the Vishnu guild&apos;s guild master Kassim got into the waiting limousine. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">[Hahaha. &#xA0;I have to thank you for easily clearing the Dungeon that was impossible for us to handle.] </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;He is thanking you for clearing the Dungeon.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Kassim couldn&apos;t speak English, so he spoke in Hindi. &#xA0;Blanka translated his words into Korean.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Mmmm. &#xA0;Hindi?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">It took only a brief time to search through his Achievement Store. &#xA0;He purchased the drug for learning Hindi, then he drank it. &#xA0;Woojin pulled a medicine bottle from mid-air, and he started to drink the content. &#xA0;Kassim looked on in confusion.</span></p><p><span style="">[Kassim? Vinshnu&apos;s Guild Master?] </span></p><p><span style="">[Oh! My god. When did you learn to speak Hindi?] </span></p><p><span style="">[I just learned it.] </span></p><p><span style="">[&#x2026;&#x2026;?] </span></p><p><span style="">Kassim tilted his head in confusion, and his expression was full of misgivings. &#xA0;However, Woojin didn&apos;t feel the need to dispel the man&apos;s doubt.</span></p><p><span style="">He was short on time, yet he was on a slow limousine that was pushing its way through the crowd. &#xA0;There were several dozen police escorting them as they headed to the airport. He had gotten into the car for only one reason.</span></p><p><span style="">[I have a deal I want to present to the Vishnu guild. ] </span></p><p><span style="">[What kind of a deal?] </span></p><p><span style="">Alandal was called the best guild in the world, because of a single Roused. This was an offer being made by Alandal. &#xA0;Kassim&apos;s eyes twinkled when the conversation turned towards guild business.</span></p><p><span style="">[I want you to give me Blanka.] </span></p><p><span style="">[Oh. &#xA0;He is my blood brother.] </span></p><p><span style="">Blanka nodded his head at Kassim&apos;s disapproval. &#xA0;On the other hand, he felt good, since this man clearly thought very highly of him. &#xA0;The world&apos;s greatest Roused was coveting him. &#xA0;He felt a sense of thrill.</span></p><p><span style="">[How much do you want?] </span></p><p><span style="">[I can&apos;t sell my brother for money&#x2026;.] </span></p><p><span style="">[I&apos;ll give you 100% rights to run this Dungeon.] </span></p><p><span style="">[&#x2026;&#x2026;.] </span></p><p><span style="">Kassim looked at him in surprise.</span></p><p><span style="">If one went by the measured Energy, this Dungeon might be over 6 stars.</span></p><p><span style="">He couldn&apos;t help, but be surprised when he was given all the rights to the Dungeon.</span></p><p><span style="">Kassim thought about the massive profit. &#xA0;Then he started to weigh it against the worth of his blood brother, who was a Rank A Roused.....</span></p><p><span style="">[H...hyung-nim!] </span></p><p><span style="">Blanka was flustered as he spoke. &#xA0;Kassim felt guilty, so he was about to turn down the offer.</span></p><p><span style="">[When another Dungeon like this forms in the future, I&apos;ll clear it and I&apos;ll give you all the rights to that one too.] </span></p><p><span style="">[Koo...koo-hmmmm.] </span></p><p><span style="">These were very risky Dungeons that couldn&apos;t be cleared by the current Roused. The profit would be massive if he could clear these Dungeons. &#xA0;He would earn the rights to two Dungeons over 6 stars for the price of a single Rank A Roused.....</span></p><p><span style="">[I&apos;ll add one more.] </span></p><p><span style="">[I&apos;ll accept the offer.] </span></p><p><span style="">Blanka looked at Kassim with a ridiculous expression.</span></p><p><span style="">[H...hyung-nim.] </span></p><p><span style="">Kassim patted Blanka&apos;s shoulder.</span></p><p><span style="">[Try to put what happened five years ago out of your mind. &#xA0;Let us settle all the debt within our hearts.] </span></p><p><span style="">When the Dungeon Shock swept across India five years ago, Blanka had saved Kassim&apos;s life. The light within Blanka&apos;s eyes shook.</span></p><p><span style="">[Didn&apos;t I save you?] </span></p><p><span style="">Blanka had save Kassim from danger. As thanks, Kassim had befriended him, and they had become blood brothers. &#xA0;Kassim coughed in embarrassment.</span></p><p><span style="">[How can I keep you to myself in the guise of repaying my debt? &#xA0;Shouldn&apos;t I want you to play in bigger waters? ] </span></p><p><span style="">[Huh&#x2026;.] </span></p><p><span style="">Woojin smirked as he listened in on their conversation.</span></p><p><span style="">[You two settle everything.] </span></p><p><span style="">He grabbed Blanka&apos;s shoulder.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Welcome to Alandal.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;&#x2026;.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Wow. Mr. Blanka agreed to come to our side?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">The conversation had been held in Hindi, so Sunggoo had no idea what had transpired. He rejoiced as he looked at Blanka. Blanka would be able to support them with his Buff magic. &#xA0;He had a variety of Buff magic, and they all had good effect.</span></p><p><span style="">It was amazing enough maximize every power by half. </span></p><p><span style="">If he joined Alandal, he wouldn&apos;t be of much help to Woojin. &#xA0;However, he would be of great help to the other Roused like Sunggoo and Haesol.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;it feels like I&apos;ve been sold.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Blanka let out a resigned sigh, and Sunggoo laughed.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Heh heh. Who cares if you were sold? &#xA0;I was caught as a collateral, yet look at how I turned out.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;&#x2026;?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;How great is it that you didn&apos;t join us after you died? Ooh-heh-heh.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;&#x2026;!&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Blanka&apos;s pupil dilated, and he looked at Kassim with desperate eyes. &#xA0;Kassim avoided his gaze.</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin&apos;s actions generated news everyday.</span></p><p><span style="">Each country&apos;s most prominent press followed Woojin. They shared every movement made by Woojin. The world&apos;s interest was focused solely on Woojin.</span></p><p><span style="">- Continuous Clear of Dungeons about to Break! </span></p><p><span style="">- Break was about to occur in one hour. &#xA0;Paris is saved.</span></p><p><span style="">- World Tour. &#xA0;He is saving Earth.</span></p><p><span style="">- Earth&apos;s final defense, Dungeon Closer Kahng-woojin!</span></p><p><span style="">While Kahng-woojin was clearing the Dungeons, there was someone, who was busily working every minute and every second of the day. &#xA0;It was Alandal&apos;s vice president... &#xA0;No, Jung-minchan had become the prime minister now.</span></p><p><span style="">- Japan wants to establish national friendship.</span></p><p><span style="">- Interview by Dubai&apos;s Prince Mahad: &#xA0;Alandal is our brother country.</span></p><p><span style="">- US &amp; China establishes diplomatic relationship with Alandal. Alandal consolidated its position as an allied country. </span></p><p><span style="">- Delhi&apos;s hero, Alandal. </span></p><p><span style="">- France has dispatched an envoy to Alandal. &#xA0;Requesting help from Korea. </span></p><p><span style="">&#x2026;&#x2026;. </span></p><p><span style="">Kahng-woojin and Alandal.</span></p><p><span style="">He had become a worldwide sensation when he swept through the Middle East. &#xA0;However, it felt as if his coverage had reached its zenith.</span></p><p><span style="">It was especially true for the war correspondents, who were rescued by Woojin in the Middle East. &#xA0;With those reporters as the core, there was a strong presence in the media that personified Woojin as a hero. &#xA0;There were even some grass root movement to deify him.</span></p><p><span style="">The world&apos;s attention was focused on Alandal, and the closest nation to Alandal was Korea.</span></p><p><span style="">Korea was shaking at its foundation.</span></p><p><span style="">Cheongwadae President&#x2019;s Room.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ha-ah. Oh well.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">President Kim-byungmahn let out a deep sigh.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;It won&apos;t matter if we enter into the treaty or not.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes. We have no options now.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">The prime minister shook his head as he faced the President.</span></p><p><span style="">The entire world had already acknowledged Alandal as a country. The US especially tried to characterize Alandal as their closest friend and ally. &#xA0;The US President revealed this fact in several official meetings.</span></p><p><span style="">The US, Japan and every country in the world was fighting to be the next one to accept Alandal as a nation.</span></p><p><span style="">What could Korea do now?</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;How&apos;s the public opinion?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;They see it as a done deal.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;&#x2026;.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">It didn&apos;t matter if they allowed it or not. &#xA0;Alandal had already become an independent nation. &#xA0;If the citizens of Korea already consider it to be a done deal....</span></p><p><span style="">There was no way they could stop it.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Start the national referendum.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Understood.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Alandal had gotten too big for Korea to sit on.</span></p><p><span style="">If they couldn&apos;t keep Alandal under their thumb, then they would have to keep Alandal as close as possible even if it was as a friend.</span></p>
