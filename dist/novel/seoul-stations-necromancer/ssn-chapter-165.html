<p><span style="">Chapter 165 - Bibi&apos;s Castle (4)&#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">Woo-soonghoon came across Hong-sunggoo in one of the hallways within Alandal. &#xA0;Soonghoon gave a bright smile towards Sunggoo.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;You are back? &#xA0;I heard you&apos;ve endured hardship.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Uh-whew. &#xA0;Don&apos;t even mention it. Anyways, was there something going on today? &#xA0;I saw an entertainer here.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;What?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;You know... &#xA0;It was Ms. Cindy from the Yuri Girls. &#xA0;I even got her signature. &#xA0;Heh heh.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Sunggoo fluttered the paper as he smiled brightly.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Ah... &#xA0;She is a high school alumni of the king and Do-jiwon-nim. &#xA0;She came over for a visit couple days ago.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Wow! Hyung-nim is friends with an entertainer?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Yes... &#xA0;It is what it is.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;That&#x2019;s big news. &#xA0;Isn&apos;t her popularity on the rise as she transition towards acting?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Ah. &#xA0;Well...&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">In terms of popularity, the King of Alandal received more public interest than an entertainer....</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Hyahh. &#xA0;It must be great. &#xA0;It means hyung-nim ate at the same table with her.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Hmmm. &#xA0;If you like her, why don&apos;t you ask her out on a date?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Hul. &#xA0;How could I ask out an entertainer?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;...&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Woo-soonghoon looked dumbfounded as he looked at the embarrassed Sunggoo.</span></p><p><span style="">Did this guy have any idea what position and renown he held within society?</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;If it&apos;s director Hong, I don&apos;t think she&apos;ll refuse.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;No way. &#xA0;How could I? &#xA0;Heh heh. &#xA0;I got her signature, so it&apos;s fine.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;...&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Was this guy really clueless about how famous he is?</span></p><p><span style="">If one said Flame Man, there is no one in Korea, who wouldn&apos;t know about him. &#xA0;No, Hong-sunggoo was even known all around the world. &#xA0;&#xA0;Yet he had no self-awareness about it.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;What about hyung-nim?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;He is in his office.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;All right. &#xA0;I&apos;ll see you next time.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Yes, director.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Sunggoo carefully folded Cindy&apos;s signature as he put it away. &#xA0;Then he started walking again.</span></p><p><span style="">***</span></p><p><span style="">Alandal King&apos;s Office.</span></p><p><span style="">Sunggoo entered after knocking, and he saw the people sitting on the sofas. &#xA0;Woojin slightly turned his head to look at him.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;You are back?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Yes, hyung-nim.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Jaenis said it is ok for you to go?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">When he mentioned Jaenis, Sunggoo instinctively frowned.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Well, at the very least, he said I won&apos;t die wherever I go.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin smirked. &#xA0;If Jaenis spoke that way, Sunggoo would be able to carry his weight.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;You did well.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Heh. &#xA0;So why are we all gathered here?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;You should sit.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Yes.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Sunggoo sat next to Jaemin.</span></p><p><span style="">Blanka and Che-haesol was sitting on the other side.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;We just have to wait for Melody to get here.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Sunggoo asked a question again when he heard Woojin&apos;s words.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;So why are we all gathered here?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Why do you think? &#xA0;This is the meeting before the expedition.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Hmmm. &#xA0;Will this be different from going to Planet Jaku? &#xA0;Don&apos;t we just have to go there and cause havoc?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin shrugged his shoulders.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;It&apos;ll be different. &#xA0;There are more formidable foes there. &#xA0;There are countless Dungeons owned by the 72 Thrones.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Who are they? &#xA0;Are they suppose to be strong?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;These 72 beings have the most Points amongst the Dimensional lords.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Are the Points proportional to one&apos;s strength?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;It&apos;s something like that. &#xA0;The Points could be used to replenish their forces. &#xA0;However, there is no chance they&apos;ll run out of Points. &#xA0;They have too many Dungeons..&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Their Dimensional Domain was large, and they had many Dungeons. &#xA0;Then there were the Points paid as taxes by the Domain Residents. &#xA0;It was like a spring water that never dried up.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;It is the same as a wealthy person going on a spending spree, yet they don&apos;t put a dent in their wealth.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I guess that&apos;s an apt comparison.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">At that moment, the door opened as Melody entered.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;The only reason why the Immortal was able to fight against them was the fact that he could replenish the forces under him.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin&apos;s forces had made up one-third of Alphen&apos;s forces.</span></p><p><span style="">There was the coalition made out of the indigenous people, Trahnet&apos;s Dimensional lords, and the unyielding Immortal, who occupied Alandal.</span></p><p><span style="">Two of the three powers never diminished in power as the fight continued on, but the coalition couldn&apos;t replenish their dead as quickly. &#xA0;This was why the balance of power had started to tilt. &#xA0;While this was ongoing, the Immortal went missing, and the downfall of the coalition happened in an instant.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;If you are here, then you should sit.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;....&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Before Melody took her seat, she bowed towards the people present here. &#xA0;To be precise, she bowed towards Kahng-woojin.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I want to really thank you for being so forward in your help to save Alphen.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Well, we have to help each other.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Melody had helped in Woojin&apos;s work. &#xA0;Moreover, he had to find the Thrash&apos;s Set Items, so he had to go to Alphen anyways. &#xA0;However, Melody couldn&apos;t help, but be deeply moved by it.</span></p><p><span style="">She had never expected aid from the planet of earth and the Immortal. &#xA0;The gift of foresight possessed by her goddess Aria was amazing. &#xA0;She had predicted this.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Then I&apos;ll start explaining the plan.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin told them the simple plan he came up with.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I&apos;ve finished establishing the gates that leads from my Dimensional Domain to Alphen and Earth.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">There were occasional challengers, but Kiba defeated them all. &#xA0;Kiba was doing a good job protecting the Return Stone.</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin continued his explanation.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;The vanguard will be Sunggoo, Melody, Jaemin and I.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;When are we supposed to head over there?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;You guys come after two days. &#xA0;That means 8 hours would have passed on Alphen. &#xA0;During that time, we will find the coalition force that is still alive. &#xA0;Then I will create a Colony city. &#xA0;It&apos;ll be our headquarters as we attempt to reclaim Alphen.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">He&apos;ll be able to use the Portal to directly connect earth and Alphen.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;At that point, Blanka and Haesol will bring over the new employees. &#xA0;Afterwards, we&apos;ll divide the group into the Rescue, Extermination and Search unit.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Everyone listened carefully to Woojin&apos;s words.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;The Rescue unit will consist of Haesol, Blanka and Melody. &#xA0;You guys will work with the Phantom unit.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">The synergy between these two groups were great. &#xA0;Blanka had his Buffs, and Melody was powerful in her own right. &#xA0;The Phantom unit will also show great strength under the control of Haesol.</span></p><p><span style="">Sunggoo tilted his head in confusion.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;So I&apos;m in the reconnaissance team with student Jaemin?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin shook his head from side to side.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;You guys are in the Extermination party. &#xA0;You guys will destroy the Dimensional lord&apos;s Colonies and Dungeons one by one.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;What?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;It&apos;ll probably be hard with just the two of you. &#xA0;You guys should combine forces with Alphen&apos;s coalition. &#xA0;You guys are in charge of taking the lead with them.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">He planned on making a counter-attack force that&apos;ll contain the coalition&apos;s remaining forces. &#xA0;Currently, Sunggoo and Jaemin were the only ones qualified to join in this unit.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Then hyung-nim will...&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin grinned.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I have to go on a treasure hunt.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Of course, he wouldn&apos;t be quiet in his search....</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I&apos;ll destroy everything in my path.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">As silence continued, Sunggoo raised his hand.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Then I can play until the morning?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Sunggoo had been doggedly fighting for his life for ever minute and every second of every day. However...</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;You have to get ready to move. &#xA0;We are heading to Busan.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;...?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Sunggoo had just arrived from Planet Jaku. &#xA0;Everyone knew about the move except him.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Then let&apos;s disperse.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Huh?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Haesol lead the still confused Sunggoo outside.</span></p><p><span style="">As everyone started to trickle out, Melody and Woojin was the only two left inside the room.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;You aren&apos;t going?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I have something to tell you.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;What is it?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I received an oracle. It seems I have to inform you of its content.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Talk.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;....&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Melody hesitated. She let out a light sigh as she opened her mouth to speak.</span></p><p><span style="">***</span></p><p><span style="">Jeju Manjang Cave.</span></p><p><span style="">A barricade had been formed at the entrance. &#xA0;The construction was used as an excuse. &#xA0;There was a commotion at this barricade.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Hey. &#xA0;I&apos;m just here to see the progress of the construction. &#xA0;I can&apos;t even do that?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;We are restricting access to this location.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I&apos;ve worked here for over 10 years!&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">The employees were adamant in blocking Kim-taesheek, who was being unreasonable. &#xA0;He had been at it for 30 minutes.</span></p><p><span style="">At that point in time, a black sedan stopped in front of the entrance.</span></p><p><span style="">Zzeeeeng.</span></p><p><span style="">When the window was rolled down, Lee-sahngho&apos;s face appeared. &#xA0;Kim-taesheek hurriedly approached him.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Aigo, manager Lee-sahngjoon.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;What is going on?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;It&#x2019;s nothing. &#xA0;I&apos;m just here to see how the construction is progressing, yet they are blocking me from entering.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Why would you be curious about it?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Isn&apos;t it natural for me to be curious about it? &#xA0;I&apos;ve worked here for 10 years, and I&apos;ve never heard or seen a maintenance work of this scale. &#xA0;Moreover, I keep seeing more and more stuff entering....&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I&apos;ll show you. &#xA0;Please get in.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Haha. &#xA0;It seems the president and I are on the same wavelength.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Kim-taesheek got on next to Lee-sahngho. &#xA0;After passing through the entrance, the car was parked at the lot.</span></p><p><span style="">As Lee-sahngho started to move, Kim-taesheek continued to press Lee-sahngho.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Well, I know manager Lee is good at his job. &#xA0;Still, isn&apos;t this is a treasured protected site? &#xA0;I&apos;m worried there will be damage.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Of course. &#xA0;I understand. &#xA0;Let&apos;s head in.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Kim-taesheek was a bit daunted by Lee-sahngho&apos;s dark mood, but he willingly followed after him. &#xA0;He had been coming to the construction site several days in a row to gain entrance. &#xA0;They had stubbornly barred Kim-taesheek from entering, and this just made him more stubborn about getting in.</span></p><p><span style="">Of course, Kim-taesheek thought he had the right to do this.</span></p><p><span style="">They had shut down the ticket office, and even the restaurant staffs were sent home the other day as they conducted this maintenance work. &#xA0;He had never seen construction work be carried here by closing down the whole place.</span></p><p><span style="">There were a lot of suspicious things going on, yet he couldn&apos;t say anything in front of the man in charge of the construction...</span></p><p><span style="">He wanted to check if everything was going well with his eyes.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Well, let&apos;s head down.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Kim-taesheek was heading down a stairway that lead towards the Manjang Cave. He shuddered when he felt some unknown dark energy.</span></p><p><span style="">Kiehk, kee-eek!</span></p><p><span style="">He heard a sound coming from the cave, and the hair on his head was standing on end.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;What is it?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;D...didn&apos;t you hear that sound right now?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;What sound?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Mmmm. &#xA0;I... Was it a bat?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">When Lee-sahngho just shrugged his shoulders, Kim-taesheek scratched the back of his head before he started moving once again. &#xA0;No... He was about to move.</span></p><p><span style="">Hweeeek! &#xA0;Puh-uhk!</span></p><p><span style="">He lost control over his body as he felt himself become airborne. &#xA0;Then he started rolling down the stairway towards the floor.</span></p><p><span style="">Puh-uhk!</span></p><p><span style="">Accompanying the impact, the pained Kim-taesheek yelled out.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Ooh-uh-uhk. &#xA0;Aigo. &#xA0;I&apos;m about to die. &#xA0;Help me. &#xA0;Please....&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Kim-taesheek put forth his hand to ask for help, but his expression soon froze. &#xA0;Lee-sahngho had a wide smile on his face, and he looked deranged.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;You...&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;You can&apos;t even take care of your body, yet you are trying to take care of this natural monument.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">After speaking those cold words, Lee-sahngho walked past him to disappear into the cave.</span></p><p><span style="">Kieeehk!</span></p><p><span style="">After Lee-sahngho disappeared into the cave, a terrifying screech was heard, and a monster snatched Kim-taesheek into the air.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Ooh-ahhhhhk!&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Kwah-jeek, Kwahk!</span></p><p><span style="">He let out his final scream as he became food for the monsters. </span></p><p><span style="">After leaving behind Kim-taesheek, Lee-sahngho headed towards the heart of the Manjang Cave, which was filled with cold air. &#xA0;He arrived at a location where Iello was sitting on a throne made out of ice.</span></p><p><span style="">[What about the Immortal?]</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;He is moving his base to a Colony city.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">[Colony city?]</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Yes, an aircraft carrier...he is constructing a Colony on a boat.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">[Do you have any other news?]</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;He plans on heading towards Planet Alphen for an expedition.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">[Planet Alphen!]</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Yes. &#xA0;He is heading out tomorrow morning.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">[Hoo hoo hoo. Foolish...he is leaving this planet unattended.]</span></p><p><span style="">Iello looked at Lee-sahngho, who had his head down in respect.</span></p><p><span style="">He had asked for this information not too long ago, yet Lee-sahngho had brought back a significant amount of information.</span></p><p><span style="">[I would have never guessed you would be this useful.]</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;...&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">For a short amount of time, Lee-sahngho had traveled to downtown Seogwipo to visit a PC room. &#xA0;Lee-sahngho thought hard on whether he should tell Iello about the existence of the internet and the various form of news available.</span></p><p><span style="">[I&apos;ll give you a reward.]</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Thank you.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Lee-sahngho got on his knees, and Iello extended his finger. &#xA0;A cold energy exited his outstretched hand, and it was absorbed through Lee-sahngho&apos;s nose.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Gasp.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">He felt an abundance of cold energy within his body, and he saw several abilities flash in front of his eyes.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I will serve you with more loyalty.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">It seems he would have to hold back on telling this being about the existence of TV or smart phones.</span></p><p><span style="">***</span></p><p><span style="">&lt;Your Colony has been formed. &#xA0;Please select its name.&gt;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin stroked his chin as he looked at the climbing tree that had matured in a single day. &#xA0;At that moment, he hadn&apos;t summoned her, but Bibi appeared next to him. &#xA0;Then she started jumping up and down.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;You should give it to me. Give me! &#xA0;You said you&apos;ll give it to me.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Mmmm.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Heeeeng. &#xA0;You said you&apos;ll let me have it.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin looked down at Bibi, who was hanging off of his leg. &#xA0;He nodded his head at her. &#xA0;In any case, he had to hand over the command of the Colony city to someone else. &#xA0;Someone else had to summon defenders and coordinate the city&#x2019;s defense on his behalf.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Well, all right. &#xA0;However. &#xA0;I won&apos;t give you much Points in decorating it.</span></p><p><span style="">It would be problematic if she decorated it like his Dimensional Domain. &#xA0;He didn&apos;t want another field of flowers.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Of course!&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;If it is for defense, you can use all the Points.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Don&apos;t worry about it! &#xA0;Leave it to me!&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">He didn&apos;t care if the Points were all poured into this venture. &#xA0;The safety of his family was more important than Points.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;All right. &#xA0;I&apos;ll leave you in charge of the Colony.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Ya-ho! &#xA0;I like master so much!&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Bibi jumped up and down.</span></p><p><span style="">The floating fortress in the sky. &#xA0;It was the emergence of Bibi&apos;s Castle.</span></p>
