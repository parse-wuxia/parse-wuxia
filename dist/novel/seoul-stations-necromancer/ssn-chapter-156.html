<p><span style="">Chapter 156 - Recruitment of Roused</span></p><p><span style="">When Woojin arrived at the Dimensional Domain, he sent his Will towards his strategist Do-jaemin.</span></p><p><span style="">[What are you doing, Jaemin?] </span></p><p><span style="">[I&apos;m beating up a really big bear.] </span></p><p><span style="">[What about defending the Portal?] </span></p><p><span style="">[Uh? We have to defend it?] </span></p><p><span style="">Of course.</span></p><p><span style="">He had left open a return portal just in case they wanted to return. &#xA0;It led directly into the lord&apos;s castle of Alandal. It was his fault for not giving them a heads up, so he could only let out a sigh.</span></p><p><span style="">[What about our loot? I left it open, so you can move it.] </span></p><p><span style="">[Ah. Is that how it is? &#xA0;No wonder the portal didn&apos;t close after I returned.] </span></p><p><span style="">[&#x2026;&#x2026;.] </span></p><p><span style="">[We are traveling around using a wagon, but there are too much stuff.] </span></p><p><span style="">[Wait a moment.] </span></p><p><span style="">Woojin wondered if there was a better solution to the problem, and he found the answer in the Dimensional Domain&apos;s Admin option.</span></p><p><span style="">He assigned points, so his vassals could use the storage room at their discretion. &#xA0;He gave Jaemin, who was his strategist, access to his Dimensional Storage room. </span></p><p><span style="">[Open the Inventory.] </span></p><p><span style="">[What? Inventory? Ooh-ahk! &#xA0;What the hell is this?] </span></p><p><span style="">[Put all the loot in there.] </span></p><p><span style="">[Wow. Jackpot. &#xA0;Wow. &#xA0;This is amazing.] </span></p><p><span style="">Jaemin kept letting out exclamation as he put all the loot into the storage. &#xA0;New Items were uploaded into his Inventory.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hmmm. A Domain administrator&#x2026;.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">The Domain residents used the Dungeons to explore and hunt on other planets. &#xA0;They brought back Bloodstones and Items as earnings. &#xA0;Even if a Dimensional lord did nothing, the points would accumulate, and the Dimensional lord&apos;s ranking would go up.</span></p><p><span style="">One had to just manage everything.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Whatever.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Woojin looked through the Inventory to see if there were any Items he needed, then he called out to a Wyvern. &#xA0;It had a saddle attached to its back. &#xA0;He passed through the portal heading to Planet Jaku as he rode the Wyvern.</span></p><p><span style="">When he passed through the portal, he immediately closed it. &#xA0;He brought out Ggaebi to scout his surrounding.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Dungeon is great. &#xA0;Colony is great. &#xA0;Just find me anything.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">[Koo-koohk. &#xA0;All right. &#xA0;I&apos;ll bring a really really good prey.] </span></p><p><span style="">Woojin tried &#xA0;hard to ignore Ggaebi&apos;s creepy laugh.</span></p><p><span style="">If he had to pick a familiar that was crazy about killing, he wouldn&apos;t hesitate to pick Ggaebi. &#xA0;Ggaebi endlessly walked that fine line, and it made Woojin feel uneasy about Ggaebi. </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Should I head out too?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Woojin got on the back of a Wyvern.</span></p><p><span style="">Kieeeeehk! </span></p><p><span style="">The Wyvern let out a roar as it pushed off with its back legs. &#xA0;It jumped into the air, and it started to flap its wings. &#xA0;After a moment, it had ascended quite far into the air, and Woojin chose the direction of their flight through his will.</span></p><p><span style="">Shwahhhk. </span></p><p><span style="">The sound of the wind assaulted his ear. &#xA0;It made one&apos;s eardrum feel numb. &#xA0;If it it got worse, his barrier of souls would activate automatically.</span></p><p><span style="">After flying for awhile, Woojin saw a colony being bombed.</span></p><p><span style="">*** </span></p><p><span style="">Dimensional lord Joseph was with the Red Hammers coalition. &#xA0;When he heard the colony he had built on the Jaku Planet was being attacked, he quickly traveled to his colony.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Which bastard dared to attack my colony! &#xA0;Which coalition was it?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">The vassal, who had been left behind to manage the colony, bowed his head.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;It wasn&apos;t one of the coalitions. Recently, some crazy bastard came to the Planet Jaku, and I believe he is the one responsible for this.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;The one that smashed the Yellow Lizards?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">It was a famous story being passed around the Dimensional lords.</span></p><p><span style="">Recently, they had all been synchronizing with a planet called earth. &#xA0;The entirety of the Yellow Lizard Coalition had decided to invade earth, and they had all met an untimely death.</span></p><p><span style="">There was only one Roused linked to the planet earth. Kahng-woojin was from earth, and he was the only Dimensional lord there.</span></p><p><span style="">The Red Hammer coalition, and the Black Hat coalition had heard the news that Kahng-woojin had come to Planet Jaku with revenge in his heart. &#xA0;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;How dare he! Activate the last line of weapons on the fortress.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;That&apos;s... &#xA0;It has already been destroyed.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">What will we do now that our fortress&apos; final weapon was destroyed?</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;How many guards do we have left?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Most of them are still alive. &#xA0;The enemy&apos;s attack was so intense that they didn&apos;t dare get any closer.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;&#x2026;?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">What kind of nonsense was this?</span></p><p><span style="">His final weapon was destroyed, yet almost all his guards were still alive...</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Then who is fighting the intruder?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;two beings attacked us, and they are fighting each other.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;&#x2026;?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Did he hear wrong? Joseph picked at his ears.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;The two of them are fighting each other?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Are they crazy? &#xA0;There were plenty of open land to fight on, so why were they fighting here?</span></p><p><span style="">Koo-roo-roo-roohng! </span></p><p><span style="">Joseph frowned when he heard his castle shake.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Those bastards!&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">His city was about to be destroyed as collateral damage to someone else&apos;s fight?</span></p><p><span style="">The infuriated Joseph stormed out of the castle. &#xA0;His weapon of choice was a large staff. &#xA0;He ascended to the top of the tower with his weapon in hand.</span></p><p><span style="">Kwah-ah-ahng. Kwahng! </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Is it a small Fire Golem?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">A Fire Golem, which had the stature of a human, was flying around the sky. &#xA0;That was what it looked like to Joseph.</span></p><p><span style="">Kwahng, kwah-ahng! </span></p><p><span style="">[Goo-ha-ha-ha.] </span></p><p><span style="">As it was letting out a deranged laughter, it shot out consecutive magic spells that was causing explosions. &#xA0;The one doing this was not a living being.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Lich?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Joseph assessed the situation.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;They said Kahng-woojin was a Necromancer. &#xA0;It seems his real identity is a Lich!&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">A poisonous bastard, who had turned himself into a Lich, had become a Dimensional lord.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ah. &#xA0;It isn&apos;t like that. &#xA0;The Dimensional lord Kahng-woojin is a human. &#xA0;The Lich is his familiar.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Joseph furrowed his brows.</span></p><p><span style="">What the hell was the Lich chasing? </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Uh, uh? They are coming toward us.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;They dare!&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Joseph raised his staff, and he gathered his magical energy. &#xA0;Before his planet went under, he had been one of the top 10 Archmages. &#xA0;A Lich and some mysterious Fire Golem dared to trash his colony.</span></p><p><span style="">Hwah-roo-roo-roohk! </span></p><p><span style="">An extreme heat that could rival the conflagration of hell was gathered.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I&apos;ll turn you into ashes!&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Shwahhhhhk! </span></p><p><span style="">It shot out like a Dragon&apos;s Breath. The unknown being he considered to be a Fire Golem was hit with the heat. &#xA0;This was Joseph&apos;s ultimate attack. &#xA0;It wasn&apos;t a joke when he described it as an attack that rivalled a Dragon&apos;s Breath.</span></p><p><span style="">However, the Fire Golem was made out of something very sturdy.</span></p><p><span style="">Shoo-shoo-shoohk! </span></p><p><span style="">It burst through the heat. The being suddenly grew in size, and its fist covered in fire was extended.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;You dare!&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">He hurriedly erected a barrier to stop it, but Joseph experienced something he had never experienced for the past 10 years.</span></p><p><span style="">Kwah-ahng! </span></p><p><span style="">His body and barrier was sent flying, and he was nailed to the outer castle wall.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;How can there be such a humiliation!&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">He got up immediately to find his opponent, but his opponent was already beside him. A foot encased in fire descended towards Joseph&apos;s head.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;&#x2026;!&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Kwah-jeek! </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Jeez. &#xA0;It&apos;s really hot.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Sunggoo grumbled as Joseph&apos;s head exploded. &#xA0;Sunggoo&#x2019;s eyes widened when the body dissolved into a gray light.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Uh? He was a Dimensional lord?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Was a Dimensional lord supposed to be this weak?</span></p><p><span style="">This thought briefly passed through Sunggoo&apos;s brain when he remembered Jaenis&apos; promise.</span></p><p><span style="">He&apos;ll be given a break if he killed a Dimensional lord or if he destroyed a Dungeon.</span></p><p><span style="">Sunggoo looked to the sky, and he saw a long-bodied dragon that had been generated out of fire. &#xA0;It had the property of chasing after its target. &#xA0;Sunggoo had run away, but in the end, it had followed him here. </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Give me a ten minute break! I caught one.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">[Goo-hoo-hoo. Too bad.] </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;&#x2026;.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Too bad?</span></p><p><span style="">Did the Lich really plan on killing him?</span></p><p><span style="">He didn&apos;t have the energy to give a reply. &#xA0;His time was too precious.</span></p><p><span style="">Sunggoo quickly sat on the floor, and he absorbed the flames that was present in the surrounding. &#xA0;During all of this, the Lich sent the Flame Dragon towards the city.</span></p><p><span style="">Kwah-kwah-kwahng. </span></p><p><span style="">Every time the Flame Dragon passed by the city, the buildings erupted in flames.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Mmmm.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">When he felt enough fire was in his body, Sunggoo opened his eyes.</span></p><p><span style="">He saw Woojin standing in front of him with the Lich.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Uh? &#xA0;When did you get here, hyung-nim?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Just right now. &#xA0;You are pretty good now.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Heh heh.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Sunggoo was able to taken down a Dimensional lord. &#xA0;He had made an incredible leap in his development.</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin grinned as he looked at the LIch.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;You have to do it properly. &#xA0;Do it properly .&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">[Goo-haha. &#xA0;I was about to start his training for real right now.] </span></p><p><span style="">Excuse me, hyung-nim and Skeleton-nim. &#xA0;How can you have so much fun when having such a conversation?</span></p><p><span style="">[Shall we fight for real now?] </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;We haven&apos;t been fighting for real...&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">[There is nothing more useful than a real fight in a training. &#xA0;Goo-haha.] </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What are you talking about&#x2026;.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Woojin spoke as he looked at the confused Sunggoo, and the gleeful Jaenis.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;While you are at it, you should clear out the surrounding a little bit.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">[Goo-ha-ha. All right. &#xA0;I&apos;ll do you a favor. &#xA0;If you kill or destroy 5 Dimensional lords or colonies, you will get a 10 minute break.] </span></p><p><span style="">Sunggoo had a tearful expression on his face.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ah. &#xA0;I&apos;m so thankful that tears are...&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">[I&apos;ll kill you in 10 seconds!] </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Shit!&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Kwahhhng! </span></p><p><span style="">Sunggoo&apos;s body exploded up into the air.</span></p><p><span style="">In a flash, Sunggoo had already flown away a great distance. &#xA0;Woojin put on a satisfied smile as he looked at Sunggoo.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;He&apos;s like a rocket now.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Useful Roused were slowly forming around him.</span></p><p><span style="">Kee-ahhhhhk! </span></p><p><span style="">The Wyvern had been roaming around the sky. &#xA0;It let out a roar, then it lowered its head. Woojin got on the saddle, and it flew into the air.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I wonder how much Jaemin has grown?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Jaemin had drunk from the Vampire Lord&apos;s Heart, and he had gone through the Ritual of Blood.</span></p><p><span style="">He was now able to turn subordinates, so he could make his own troops. &#xA0;Moreover, his physical growth limit had risen to a sky high level. &#xA0;Woojin&apos;s expectation of Jaemin was on a whole different level now.</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin unnecessarily felt excited as he drove the Wyvern towards Jaemin.</span></p><p><span style="">*** </span></p><p><span style="">The madness that made him lose his mind was gone.</span></p><p><span style="">He didn&apos;t recklessly charge into his enemies.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hoo hoo hoo.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Now he was constantly insane.</span></p><p><span style="">Kwah-kwahng, kwahng! </span></p><p><span style="">Every time Jaemin moved blood exploded.</span></p><p><span style="">He wasn&apos;t alone now.</span></p><p><span style="">Goo-ooh-ooh. </span></p><p><span style="">His subordinates were now dependent on blood. &#xA0;They were like red eyed zombies as they ran in towards the enemies. &#xA0;There were orcs, goblins, and even ogres amongst them.</span></p><p><span style="">Jaemin walked into a battlefield that was a complete pandemonium. &#xA0;Corpses that had been bitten were strewn everywhere.</span></p><p><span style="">The eyes of his subordinates became redder, and much sharper. &#xA0;One could even feel a sense of dignity from them too.</span></p><p><span style="">One couldn&apos;t look down on them.</span></p><p><span style="">These pawns were all his subordinates, but at the same time, they were challengers that could attack him at any time.</span></p><p><span style="">Jaemin had killed and drank from the Vampire that had bitten him. &#xA0;This allowed him to absorb the Vampire&apos;s power through the Succession of Blood. &#xA0;If he showed a little bit of weakness to his underlings, they&apos;ll challenge him.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ooh-ooh-ooh.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Jaemin came to a stop in front of a moaning human.</span></p><p><span style="">His two legs had been severed, and his arm couldn&apos;t be moved from being crushed. One could see his eyes through the blood covering his face. &#xA0;One could see fear, and at the same time, there was malice in those eyes.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Do you want to live?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;H...help me.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">The malice turned to begging as his eyes started to fill up with tears.</span></p><p><span style="">He liked seeing the fear. &#xA0;He liked seeing the will to live in this man&#x2019;s eyes. &#xA0;This would be the foundation to the loyalty that would be given to Jaemin.</span></p><p><span style="">Death was the end of the road for the refugees wandering around the Dimensional Domain.</span></p><p><span style="">Jaemin bit his hand, and he wetted the lips of the dying human warrior. </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ooh ooh ooh ooh.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">His eyes opened wide as the vessel in his eyes burst open. &#xA0;Then his body started to shake.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Koo-ah-ah!&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">The man let out a scream as his body was surrounded by black blood before his body exploded. &#xA0;The pieces of his body turned into several dozen bats as they flew around Jaemin.</span></p><p><span style="">Jji-jee-jee-jeek.</span></p><p><span style="">The bats coalesced in front of Jaemin, and it formed into the warrior that had been about to die. &#xA0;His face was whiter than before, but this severed limbs were completely regenerated.</span></p><p><span style="">His purple lips was bloodless, and it was proof that his life had gone through a change.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Name?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Cabal.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">His cracked voice gave an answer. &#xA0;Jaemin could feel it.</span></p><p><span style="">He could feel this man&apos;s hate and fear towards him. &#xA0;Moreover, he could feel his thirst for blood. &#xA0;It was all transmitted to him. &#xA0;If he showed a fraction of weakness, this man would try to eat Jaemin.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Kneel.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">At Jaemin&apos;s words, Cabal got on one knee, and he lowered his head. This underling was different from the monsters he had turned.</span></p><p><span style="">He was the first member of Do-jaemin&apos;s tribe. &#xA0;His family of blood had been born.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Drink the blood of the enemies.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Kyahhh.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">When he got Jaemin&apos;s assent, Cabal immediately ran towards the battlefield. &#xA0;It seemed Cabal was thirsting for blood so much that he couldn&apos;t maintain his rationality.</span></p><p><span style="">This reminded Jaemin of his old self, so he put on a bitter smile.</span></p><p><span style="">He felt an indescribable thrill at gaining an underling that would follow his every word. &#xA0;Jaemin&apos;s two fists were trembling.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;I&#x2019;m pretty cool now.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">Jaemin was slowly turning in a noble of the night.</span></p>
