<p><span style="">Chapter 146 - Doctor Toppler (2)</span></p><p></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;My goals align with your goals.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Do you mean the defense of earth?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Toppler nodded his head as he smiled.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I&apos;m a proponent of everyone being able to protect their own planet.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Jo-ro-ro.</span></p><p><span style="">A milky-white tea was infused when the hot water was poured on top of the tea bag. &#xA0;Woojin took the cup in front of him, and he took a sip.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;How long have you been on Earth?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;If you are asking for my age, I&apos;m 45 years old.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Are you fucking with me?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I am serious..&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Woojin glared at him before he asked another question.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Why didn&apos;t you tell everyone about the impending Dungeon Shock? &#xA0;Why didn&apos;t you inform everyone?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;They would have thought I was a raving lunatic.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hmm. &#xA0;That is true.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Woojin nodded his head.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Then what about the conjectures you released on the tv program?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">He was known as the top researcher regards to anything related to the Dungeons.</span></p><p><span style="">Toppler had formed several hypotheses, and he had talked about the reasons behind the Dungeon formation, and its reciprocal relationship with the monsters. &#xA0;Moreover, he denounced the Dungeon businesses for accelerating the Dungeon Reset.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Those are all facts.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">It wasn&apos;t hypotheses. He had been telling the truth.</span></p><p><span style="">How did Toppler find out about all this?</span></p><p><span style="">Was it through personal experience? &#xA0;Did he witness it?</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Why didn&apos;t you incrementally release more information?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Nobody would have believed me if I revealed everything I knew.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;How about now?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Dr. Toppler&apos;s research wasn&apos;t only known in England. His research regarding the Dungeons was known worldwide. His words would hold a much different weight than 5 years ago.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I didn&apos;t have a solution to the problem. &#xA0;If I spoke about it, it would have just caused mass confusion.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Toppler was once again correct in his words.</span></p><p><span style="">Wooin&apos;s forehead furrowed. </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Then tell me what you held back.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Don&apos;t you already know about it?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">His words implied that Woojin had already witnessed everything on Alphen where the Dungeons had appeared.</span></p><p><span style="">Holy Maiden Melody&apos;s complexion darkened.</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin drank his tea as he leaned back into his chair.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Well, all right. By looking at your attitude, you already knew I would be coming back to earth?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I was waiting for someone.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;So it didn&apos;t have to be me?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Toppler affirmed with his silence. &#xA0;Woojin asked another question.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What&apos;s the name of your planet?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I&apos;ll tell you later.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Woojin shrugged his shoulders.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Well, all right. &#xA0;It doesn&apos;t really matter to me as to which planet you are from.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">He had allied himself with the Holy Maiden, who was from Alphen. There was no reason why he should decline working with beings from other Dimensions. &#xA0;Of course, there were other reasons why he was leery about working with Toppler.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Let us share what each of us needs.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Woojin had searched for the past 20 years, but he had never found the answers to his questions. &#xA0;He asked one of those questions to Toppler.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I don&apos;t want the other Dimensional lords to be able to link to earth in the future. &#xA0;No, I actually want to get rid of all the Dungeons that are linked to earth. &#xA0;Do you know of a method?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Woojin&apos;s voice was filled with killing intent. If Toppler didn&apos;t have the answer, there was no reason for Woojin to hold hands with some unknown human from a different dimension.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Of course.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Woojin&apos;s eyes shone. He was purposefully maintained his calm in an attempt to hide the sound of his racing heart.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;How would I go about doing it?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Do you know the true identity of Trahnet?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Vaguely.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I guess it doesn&apos;t matter how it was formed. Trahnet caused a supernatural network to form between the planets.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Dimensional travel.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;That&apos;s right. The initial unstable links allowed for living beings to travel to other dimensions.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">This had been the case for Woojin. He had Dimensional travelled to Alphen.</span></p><p><span style="">It was as if Toppler knew his past in detail, and it bothered Woojin.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Have you been observing me for a long time?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;No way. &#xA0;I only heard about you from the news.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Stories related to Woojin had been translated and spread by various news outlets around the world. &#xA0;It was a reasonable explanation.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;It isn&apos;t as if I was waiting for Kahng-woojin-nim. I was just waiting for someone, who would be able to fix my home planet.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Well, all right. &#xA0;I&apos;m not sure who you are waiting for, but it is true that I went and came back from Alphen.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;That&apos;s what I thought. &#xA0;There are a lot of beings that travelled to a different Dimension like you, but it is hard to find those, who survived the experience.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">There might be others, but Woojin was the only one, who had returned to earth.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;If Trahnet is a supernatural network, then the Dimensional Domains are a connecting node between planets.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Didn&apos;t I ask you for the solution?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Toppler cleared his throat at Woojin&apos;s words.</span></p><p><span style="">It wasn&apos;t wise to talk about the fundamental theories behind a subject with a short-tempered person.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;If you want to stop the link, you have to build a firewall.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;How do I do that?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Toppler glanced at the Holy Maiden. &#xA0;Woojin&apos;s eyes followed Toppler&apos;s gaze, and his gaze also landed on her.</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin&apos;s brows furrowed.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Gods&#x2026;.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;If the firewall is weak, a hole can be made. &#xA0;If it is strong, it&apos;ll repel any attempts.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">There was no god on earth.</span></p><p><span style="">No, was a god about to wake up here? </span></p><p><span style="">However, the existence of a god didn&apos;t matter right now since the link had already been formed. &#xA0;They couldn&apos;t use the preventative measure any more.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;The link itself isn&apos;t a bad thing. It lets one ignore the physical distance, and it allows one to travel to different planets.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;So how do I sever it?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Earth cannot be cut-off any more.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;&#x2026;.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Woojin stood up from his seat.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;This conversation is at an end.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Cha-chang.</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin took out his spear, but Toppler didn&apos;t show any signs of nervousness.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;You said I didn&apos;t have a soul.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I found my hope in you.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What are you talking about?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;You have the eyes that can gain insight into the truth. You are closest in description with the person I have been searching for.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;So what? It seems you aren&apos;t going to be of much help to me.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">He didn&apos;t care if Toppler had been waiting for a person with a specific set of abilities. &#xA0;The important part was that Toppler&apos;s words were of no help to him.</span></p><p><span style="">He didn&apos;t feel the need to continue a fruitless relationship.</span></p><p><span style="">Toppler spoke before Woojin could move his spear.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;The real problem isn&apos;t the link. &#xA0;It is the beings that abuse the links. I&apos;m talking about the Dimensional lords.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">These were beings that maintained the connection nodes, but all of them coveted the planets.</span></p><p><span style="">The root of all the tragedies were their greed.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I keep killing them, yet it is an endless process. &#xA0;How can I stop them?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;If they are insidious like a virus, you have to become the vaccine.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;&#x2026;.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Woojin&apos;s expression stiffened.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;You probably already know of a way.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;&#x2026;.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Alphen&apos;s greatest scholar.</span></p><p><span style="">Jaenis had made himself into a Lich, and he had fought the advance of Trahnet. &#xA0;Woojin remembered a word spoken by his teacher.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Thrash&apos;s Executioner.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">The problem was that he didn&apos;t know if the item actually existed, and he had no way of finding more information about it.</span></p><p><span style="">It seemed Toppler wasn&apos;t going to give any answers to his problems.</span></p><p><span style="">Paht! </span></p><p><span style="">Toppler abruptly stood up from his seat, and he ran towards his bedroom.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;It seems I&apos;ll be killed if I stay here any longer. &#xA0;Let&apos;s end our first meeting here.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Huh!&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Woojin took in a short intake of breath. &#xA0;Woojin had his guard down when he saw Toppler run away. When Toppler passed through the door, his figure disappeared. Woojin had witnessed this anomaly many times before.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;It&apos;s a Dungeon.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">The barrier formed within 30 seconds after one entered. &#xA0;One would be cut off entirely from the outside by the barrier. &#xA0;Woojin quickly threw his body towards the door.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Wait here.&quot; </span></p><p><span style="">He left behind the Holy Maiden as he entered the Dungeon. &#xA0;Woojin looked around the bedroom.</span></p><p><span style="">Shoo-shoohk. </span></p><p><span style="">He frowned when the barrier formed over the doorway.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;That son of a bitch.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Woojin couldn&apos;t see his soul, so he couldn&apos;t detect Toppler.</span></p><p><span style="">Fortunately, this was the smallest Dungeon Woojin had come across.</span></p><p><span style="">Kwah-dah-dahng. </span></p><p><span style="">Woojin kicked the bed, and it was roughly pushed away.</span></p><p><span style="">Kwah-jeek! </span></p><p><span style="">He stabbed his spear into the wardrobe, but one could only see several clothes when the door was opened.</span></p><p><span style="">The small bedroom had a bed, wardrobe and a desk. That was it.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Huh&#x2026;. What is he?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">It was as if the process of making a Dungeon was inconsequential to Toppler. &#xA0;He had artificially &#xA0;made a small Dungeon.</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin was aware about the possibility of artificially creating a Dungeon in locations other than the subway stations, so he wasn&apos;t particularly surprised by this move. &#xA0;However, Woojin had entered the Dungeon with him, yet Toppler had disappeared from the Dungeon. &#xA0;This pretty much put the known theories about the Dungeons on its head.</span></p><p><span style="">He wanted to make sure Toppler wasn&apos;t using some kind of Cloaking ability, so he filled the room with poison gas. &#xA0;He also attacked the surrounding with his Spirit Spears. </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What the hell am I doing&#x2026;.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">The person, who had entered with him, had disappeared. This was the first time he had experienced such a phenomenon.</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin&apos;s gaze landed on a Return Stone placed on top of the desk.</span></p><p><span style="">There were no monsters here. &#xA0;There wasn&apos;t even a portal heading towards a Dimensional Domain present. &#xA0;It was just a bedroom.</span></p><p><span style="">He wouldn&apos;t be able to find Toppler&apos;s location by searching more thoroughly, so he exited the Dungeon with the Return Stone.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Are you ok?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I&apos;m fine. Do you have any theories on what just happened?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">The Holy Maiden&apos;s elegant eyebrows arched. From her perspective, Toppler had been a strange, but she couldn&apos;t pinpoint the reason behind her feeling.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I didn&apos;t feel anything special.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hooo. &#xA0;Jaenis.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Shwahhhhhk. </span></p><p><span style="">The black smoke dissipated as the Lich appeared.</span></p><p><span style="">When Jaenis was summoned, he frowned when he looked at the Holy Maiden. &#xA0;He took a step to the side away from her. Woojin asked him a question.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Do you remember that time?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">[When are you referring to?] </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;The day when you chose to become my familiar.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">[&#x2026;&#x2026;.] </span></p><p><span style="">Woojin had a serious expression on his face.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Why did you do it?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">[You had a special quality, lord.] </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I didn&apos;t &#xA0;have It at that time.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">This was something he hadn&apos;t told Toppler.</span></p><p><span style="">[The god&apos;s blessing isn&apos;t the special quality I&apos;m talking about.] </span></p><p><span style="">The ability to see the color of souls was something he gained after he came face to face with the gods. &#xA0;However, Jaenis had a different reason for insisting on becoming Woojin&apos;s familiar. </span></p><p><span style="">[There are only a handful of people with the potential to reach the pinnacle as a Necromancer. &#xA0;In the end, you reached the pinnacle. &#xA0;I made the right choice in choosing you, lord.] </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Necromancer&#x2026;.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">The property of being a Necromancer.</span></p><p><span style="">He had reached the pinnacle, and he had seen everything related to death.</span></p><p><span style="">He had even been ready to carry on Thrash&apos;s progress...</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;In the end, I have to find the Executioner.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">[I guess it is better to piece together the puzzle instead of trying to solve a riddle.] </span></p><p><span style="">Thrash&apos;s Set Items.</span></p><p><span style="">There was the helm, armor, belt, gloves and boots.</span></p><p><span style="">He had to gather the five set items first. The existence of Thrash&apos;s Executioner &#xA0;was still up in the air, so he&apos;ll worry about it after getting the set.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Let&apos;s return.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Woojin opened a portal that connected to the Dimensional Domain of Alandal.</span></p><p><span style="">***</span></p><p><span style="">The car was heading towards the city state of Alandal. Jung-minchan and Woo-soonghoon was sitting in the back-seats, and they were wordlessly laughing.</span></p><p><span style="">They had been successful in finalizing the treaty with the government. &#xA0;It was quite apparent as to which side held the knife, so everything progressed with lightning speed.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Aigo. &#xA0;Should I call you Minister now? &#xA0;When did you learn so many foreign language? &#xA0;Great job.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">The corners of Woo-soonghoon&apos;s mouth twitched.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Uh-whew. &#xA0;Prime minister Jung did the hard work.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Huht-huh-huh! Prime minister Jung!&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">He repeated those words, and it still made him laugh.</span></p><p><span style="">He had never expect to be promoted this high. &#xA0;He had become a Prime minister...</span></p><p><span style="">Moreover, he was a Prime minister of a newly made country that had massive influence over the world.</span></p><p><span style="">He was trying hard to stay calm, but he was having a hard time suppressing his ambitions from rising up.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Huh? It seems president has finished his business in England.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What? He hasn&apos;t contacted me yet.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Woojin had taken the KH guild&apos;s private plane. &#xA0;Woo-soonghoon should be the one attending Woojin, but he had work to do. &#xA0;This was why he had sent his underling with them, but the employee hadn&apos;t contacted him yet.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Look over here.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Soonghoon pushed forward his handphone. &#xA0;There was a selfie of Woojin, the Holy Maiden and a British reporter named Jonie uploaded on the SNS.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Didn&apos;t you know I have a lot of international acquaintances now that I&apos;m the head of the diplomatic department? &#xA0;I met this reporter when I went to the Middle East with the president. She requested to be friends with me. She&apos;s one of my SNS friends.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Huh huh. &#xA0;He should be back here soon if he took care of the colonies in England.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I think so. We&apos;ll have to quickly report to president on what happened today.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hu hu. &#xA0;We finally did something big.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Jung-minchan and Woo-soonghoon had expressions full of pride on their faces. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">They had resolved an important business. &#xA0;It felt as if they were main characters that had &#xA0;accomplished something big. &#xA0;Their actions would be recorded in world history. &#xA0;Jung-minchan ignored his car-sickness as he once again went over the report regarding the treaty.</span></p><p><span style="">The vehicle carrying the two of them arrived at Alandal&apos;s front gate. However, there was unrest at the gate.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ah. &#xA0;I said you can&apos;t come in here.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Oh-ooh. &#xA0;Isn&apos;t this place Alandal? &#xA0;I know the president.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ah. &#xA0;The president doesn&apos;t know anyone like you.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I promised him I&apos;ll be here.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ah, jeez. &#xA0;You name isn&apos;t on the appointment list.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Don&apos;t you know who I am? I&apos;m famous in India.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;How would I know about someone from India?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">The security guard manning the front gate was arguing with a foreigner. &#xA0;Fortunately, Woo-soonghoon had met him before. &#xA0;Woo-soonghoon rolled down the window, and he yelled out in greeting.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Blanka!&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Oh, Soonghoon!&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">As promised, Blanka had left the Vishnu guild, and he had come to Korea.</span></p>
