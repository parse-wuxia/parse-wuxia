<p><span style="">Chapter &#xA0;144 - Colonies (2)</span></p><p><span style="">The monsters had spread out with the colony at its center. &#xA0;However, Woojin didn&apos;t need to run all over the place to catch the monsters that were intent on killing the humans.</span></p><p><span style="">He was going for a straight rush towards the colony!</span></p><p><span style="">The monsters were under the control of the Dimensional lord. &#xA0;Their foremost goal wasn&apos;t to hunt down humans. &#xA0;It was to defend the colony. The colonies on the planet were basically like Dungeons.</span></p><p><span style="">It was like Rashmode&apos;s Summon Magic Circle. &#xA0;Instead of subway stations, these were artificial Dungeons built on the the surface. &#xA0;It was called the Dimensional Gates.</span></p><p><span style="">When Woojin slowly advanced, it was as expected. &#xA0;The monsters that had been attacking in other directions converged towards him. This in turn grew the size of Undead army.</span></p><p><span style="">Every point Woojin gained from the Level Up was put towards the Control.</span></p><p><span style="">The Skeleton Warriors were all under the command of the Death Knights, and each Death Knights required only 1 Point to be consumed. &#xA0;He had Lich Jaenis, who had become level 99 in an instant, and 10 Skeleton Magicians were put under his control per level. &#xA0;He could control a total of 990 Skeleton Magicians.</span></p><p><span style="">The combined Control Points he needed to maintain the Undead army, the Death Knights, Lich, Golem, and the little devil was less than 100.</span></p><p><span style="">The rest of his Control was used on his other underlings.</span></p><p><span style="">Goo-oh-oh-oh. </span></p><p><span style="">Koo-uh-uhk! </span></p><p><span style="">The corpses were reanimated as puppets. &#xA0;Their appearances were unaltered from their death.</span></p><p><span style="">There were over 2000 zombies marching toward the enemies. &#xA0;They were a bit slow.</span></p><p><span style="">The Zombie army was a mixture of small and large monsters. &#xA0;There were even ogres mixed in with the army.</span></p><p><span style="">Kwhang, kwah-ahng! </span></p><p><span style="">[Sssooohp. Ha-ah-ah. I&apos;m excited. I&apos;m really excited.] </span></p><p><span style="">Ggaebi had possessed the corpse of an ogre, and he was rampaging like a madman.</span></p><p><span style="">When one revived a corpse into a zombie, its capability was diminished compared to when it was alive. However, when Ggaebi possessed the body, he was able to squeeze out ability that was superior compared to corpse&#x2019;s ability before death.</span></p><p><span style="">Kwahng! </span></p><p><span style="">Gweeeehk! </span></p><p><span style="">The possessed ogre ripped out a road sign, and the ogre swung it like a blunt weapon. &#xA0;Ggaebi&apos;s performance was almost on par with Dolsae.</span></p><p><span style="">These two were well-suited at causing chaos as they penetrated the enemy lines.</span></p><p><span style="">The Undead army followed as the two opened up a path.</span></p><p><span style="">After walking across corpses on top of corpses, Woojin was able to reach the Colosseum.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;It&apos;s grown a lot.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">The tree&apos;s roots were spread as if it was encasing the Colosseum, and the tree was taller than most buildings one could find here. &#xA0;When Woojin looked up, a Titan fell from the sky.</span></p><p><span style="">Koooooohng. </span></p><p><span style="">The Titan was easily over 10 meters tall, and its size rivaled Dolsae.</span></p><p><span style="">[You are the bastards that defeated Rajakui-nim!] </span></p><p><span style="">Woojin didn&apos;t dismount from his horse. He shrugged his shoulder.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;As you can see...&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">[Koo-oh-oh. I am Nicktor. I&apos;ll avenge the death of Rajakui-nim!] </span></p><p><span style="">Woojin let out a sigh.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Your head is big, yet you don&apos;t have a brain? &#xA0;Can you win against Rajakui?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">[Koo-oh-oh! Rajakui-nim is a Great Dimensional lord. He is stronger than me, so I follow him.] </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I killed that bastard, yet you think you can beat me?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">[Koo-ooh-ooh-ooh.] </span></p><p><span style="">Nicktor of the Giant race raised his large hand, and it scratched its head. Then it raised a really big hammer in anger.</span></p><p><span style="">[Koo-oh-oh! How dare you insult a warrior.] </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Is it retarded?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Woojin had a dumbfounded expression on his face.</span></p><p><span style="">This is why Giant races are...</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Kill it.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">[As the lord commands!] </span></p><p><span style="">The Death Knights jumped off their Phantom Steeds, and they charged towards the enemy.</span></p><p><span style="">Hoo-ooh-ooh-oong! </span></p><p><span style="">[Koo-ooh. &#xA0;How dare you, you little flies!] </span></p><p><span style="">Nicktor was zealously swinging his hammer, but it failed to hit anyone. &#xA0;The Death Knights were dealing deadly attacks, so it was false to compare them to flies. The Death Knights started mutilating the giant.</span></p><p><span style="">Ssuh-kuhk, kwah-jeek! </span></p><p><span style="">If one excluded the two new Knights in Al Assad and Relick, all the other Death Knights were over S Rank.</span></p><p><span style="">It didn&apos;t even take 1 minute to defeat the giant. Rackto&apos;s spear pierced its forehead, and the giant fell.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Tidy up the surrounding.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">[There is only death in front of the lord!] </span></p><p><span style="">[Clear away everything that is alive!] </span></p><p><span style="">The Skeletons and Death Knights moved busily to exterminate the remaining monsters. &#xA0;As Woojin was looking up at the foothold, Jaenis appeared next to him.</span></p><p><span style="">[I&apos;ve seen this unsightly thing too many times now.] </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Do you think it&apos;ll come out?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">[Do you mean the Dimensional Fragment?] </span></p><p><span style="">Woojin had cleared 9 colonies in Seoul and Busan. &#xA0;He had gained three Dimensional Fragments out of the nine locations. &#xA0;Those odds were pretty good, so there was a basis to his expectation. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes. It is an item with a lot of uses.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">[The link to Trahnet....] </span></p><p><span style="">Jaenis raised his staff, and flames erupted. Woojin raised his hand to stop him.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;It&apos;s all right. I&apos;ll do it.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">The zombies had been standing around doing nothing. &#xA0;At his command, the zombies charged the colony, and they started to hang all over the tree. &#xA0;He had to get rid of the zombies anyways....</span></p><p><span style="">Kwahhhhng! </span></p><p><span style="">The walking undeads blew up, and the colony was swept up in the explosion.</span></p><p><span style="">Debris started falling from the sky as it littered the the surrounding. When the debris ceased to fall, he head towards the center of the Colosseum, which had lost its original form.</span></p><p><span style="">A gem letting out a bright purple light was floating in the air.</span></p><p><span style="">&lt;You&apos;ve gained a Dimensional Fragment.&gt; </span></p><p><span style="">Aside from purchasing a Dungeon, the Dimensional Fragments had many other uses. Since he had more than three, he could make the Holy Maiden or someone else a Dimensional lord if he desired it.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Anyways, they came out from Greece yet why did they make their colony here?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">[It seemed the Titan liked the energy around this place.] </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hmm. Maybe it has something to do with the synchronization.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Woojin thought about it as he stroked his chin.</span></p><p><span style="">When he chose the Seoul Station as his Dimensional Domain, he had to consider the synchronization rate. All the Dimensional lords were putting their colonies in historic sites or places where a lot of people gathered.</span></p><p><span style="">Now that he thought about it, one would be able to make a new Dungeon that was unlike the Dungeons seen up until now using a Dimensional Fragment.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;If a foothold akin to the one Rashmode made was created then it&apos;ll be problem.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">Wasn&apos;t it the result of a research carried out by a professor studying the Dungeons?</span></p><p><span style="">The professor he come across in the US had artificially created a Dungeon.</span></p><p><span style="">It would be dangerous if there were people creating Summoning Magic Circle to call for the Dimensional lords. &#xA0;It wouldn&apos;t be like this where the mob of monsters would give away the Dimensional lord&apos;s location.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Well, there might already be a lot of them here&#x2026;.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">Maybe, there were Dimensional lords on earth moving around stealthily. Woojin stopped worry about it, since it wasn&#x2019;t something he could prevent.</span></p><p><span style="">If he wanted a permanent solution, he had to block further Dungeon Links from forming. &#xA0;He had to stop it at the source.</span></p><p><span style="">However, Woojin had no idea how he should accomplish this.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;All right. &#xA0;Let&apos;s clear this place, and we can head to Germany.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">He had earned a Dimensional Fragment, and he was able to kill several thousand monsters.</span></p><p><span style="">There was one colony in Germany, and there were two left in England.</span></p><p><span style="">*** </span></p><p><span style="">Jaejoo Manjanggul Cave Ticket Office.</span></p><p><span style="">There were seven trucks with containers that approached the ticket office. &#xA0;The employee stepped outside. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">A group of people got off a sedan that had accompanied the trucks.</span></p><p><span style="">The employee recognized a face amongst the group of people.</span></p><p><span style="">The ticket office employee spoke as if they were old acquaintances.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What is all this stuff?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ah, do you remember the official notice that you received? The repair work is being performed ahead of the regular schedule.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;You should have told us sooner. &#xA0;There are still tourists inside&#x2026;.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ha ha. &#xA0;I&apos;m sorry. Please stop any tourists from entering from now on. Please send out an announcement and allow the people on tour to exit slowly. &#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes. &#xA0;I&apos;ll do so.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ah. This is manager Lee-sahngjoon. &#xA0;He is in charge of the renovation.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">The ticket office employee headed towards the man wearing his sunglasses.</span></p><p><span style="">He had a bit of a cold demeanor, and it was hard to strike up a conversation with him. &#xA0;He was giving off a cold vibe.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;My name is Lee-sahngjoon.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I&apos;m Kim-taesheek.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Let&apos;s do this.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">After the greeting, Lee-sahngjoon ordered the workers to unload the trucks. &#xA0;Numerous containers kept coming out of the containers. &#xA0;The employee named Kim-taesheek asked a question as he saw the unidentified boxes.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What are all those thing? It seems you guys aren&apos;t the one, who repaired the guardrails last time...&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;We hired a different company. &#xA0;Please stop asking so much questions. &#xA0;Please help us, so we can finish the construction in a timely fashion.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes, I&apos;ll do so.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">They probably switched companies to get another rebate.</span></p><p><span style="">Still, there were too many loads here to be considered a normal guardrail repair job.</span></p><p><span style="">Signs were put up starting from the Manjanggul Cave&apos;s parking lot. &#xA0;The do not enter signs were placed in various locations to keep out people from entering.</span></p><p><span style="">The government employee had left, so Kim-taesheek had nothing to do. &#xA0;This was why he started to hang around the entrance to the cave. &#xA0;The workers were very strong, and they were easily carrying the heavy boxes down the stairs.</span></p><p><span style="">Manager Lee-sahngjoon came over to Kim-taesheek.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;This is a construction site now, and it may be dangerous. &#xA0;Please stand back.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ah, jeez. &#xA0;I was just bored...&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Stand back.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Uh-whew. &#xA0;All right.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Kim-taesheek grumbled as he stepped backwards. &#xA0;Lee-sahngjoon called several workers over.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;You guys should prevent anyone from getting in.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes, president.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Kim-taesheek watched as Lee-sahngjoon walked down the stairs. &#xA0;There were lights overhead, yet he only took off his sunglasses when he was in &#xA0;the dark cave.</span></p><p><span style="">The owner of the hidden face was none other than the Hwarang&apos;s guild master. &#xA0;It was Iello&apos;s vassal, Lee-sahngho.</span></p><p><span style="">The workers were all ex-employees of the Hwarang guild.</span></p><p><span style="">After walking a long time into the cave, Lee-sahngho arrived at a location where the boxes were stacked up.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Open it.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">The employee threw open the lid to the containers.</span></p><p><span style="">One could see red minerals letting out faint light.</span></p><p><span style="">Several hundred boxes were filled to the brim with Bloodstones.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;&#x2026;.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Lee-sahngho wordlessly started to draw a magic circle on the floor of the cave.</span></p><p><span style="">It was a Gate to call Iello-nim here.</span></p><p><span style="">He started the construction of a foothold.</span></p><p><span style="">*** </span></p><p><span style="">Germany. </span></p><p><span style="">They arrived at a devastated site.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Did used to be a famous art museum?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;That&apos;s what I heard.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hmmm. &#xA0;They did well in blocking it.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Helicopters and Roused were busily moving about the ruins, and the soldiers were all wearing gas masks. For a brief moment, Woojin gave a short appreciation of the what he was seeing.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I came here for nothing.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">His EXP was gone, and he had also wasted his time.</span></p><p><span style="">Germany had put in an official request for help to Alandal, but they hadn&apos;t sat on their hands until Woojin arrived. </span></p><p><span style="">They used tactical nuclear weapons to clear away the groups of monsters, and they had sent in an elite Roused unit to hunt down the Dimensional lord.</span></p><p><span style="">No, the people of earth had named them as &apos;Monster lords&apos;.</span></p><p><span style="">Aside from Woojin, Germany was the fourth country that had been successful in hunting down a Monster lord.</span></p><p><span style="">The Holy Maiden looked on with regrettable eyes as she watched the soldiers take away the gem letting out a glaring purple light.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Aren&apos;t you going to recover that one?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Woojin smirked.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Do you think I&apos;m a thief? &#xA0;I won&apos;t steal from others.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;&#x2026;.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">The Holy Maiden looked on with a little bit of resentment on her face.</span></p><p><span style="">If he was such a virtuous man, why did he take her Dimensional Fragment?</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Do you feel wronged?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;No.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I said I&apos;ll pay you back, yet you refused to take it.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I didn&apos;t say anything.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Yes, she didn&apos;t say anything, but he was troubled to see the resentment in her eyes.</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin shrugged his shoulder with a leery expression on his face.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Well, let&apos;s head to England before we are too late.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes, monarch.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Woojin and the Holy Maiden headed towards the helicopter they had ridden here from the airport. &#xA0;At that moment, a group of people got off from a car, and they rushed towards Woojin. &#xA0;By seeing the cameras and their appearance, one could tell they were reporters.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hero! It&apos;s been awhile.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Amongst them, one of the reporter had an unusually enthusiastic expression on his face. &#xA0;He approached Woojin as he lowered his head in greeting. &#xA0;Woojin&apos;s memory wasn&apos;t too bad. No, it was unbelievably good compared to a normal human.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Didn&apos;t I see you in the Middle East?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Oh, my gosh! I can&apos;t believe you remembered such an unimportant person as me. &#xA0;It is an honor.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Woojin smirked.</span></p><p><span style="">This man was one of the war correspondents he rescued in the Middle East.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Well, I&apos;m busy, so I&apos;ll turn down any requests for troublesome interviews.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;No, sir. &#xA0;How could I take time away from such an important person. &#xA0;I heard you were coming here, so I came to say hello.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;And you came to take pictures.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Woojin looked at the several dozen cameras pointed at him as he spoke.</span></p><p><span style="">The reporter shook his head from side to side as his face turned pale.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;No way. &#xA0;I wouldn&#x2019;t dare to do such a thing.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">The war correspondent was being overly carefully in front of his benefactor, who had saved his life. &#xA0;Woojin spoke as he grabbed the man&apos;s shoulder.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Well, I guess taking picture is part of your job. &#xA0;Instead, let me ask you for a favor..&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Oh. &#xA0;It&apos;ll be an honor. &#xA0;Please let me know what I can do. &#xA0;I&apos;ll do anything.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">When Woojin put his arms around his shoulders, the reporter looked as if he would run straight into a battle if asked. &#xA0;He had a fervent expression on his face.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Do you know anyone in England? &#xA0;I need to look up someone there.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;There is a member of S.E.E. in England. Her name is Jonie&#x2026;.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;S.E.E? What the hell is that?&#x201D;</span></p>
