<p><span style="">Chapter 148 - Expedition (2)</span></p><p><span style="">People were gathered like a swarm of bees in front of the Seoul Station&apos;s 1st Exit.</span></p><p><span style="">There was a food cart, and a ring of reporters around it. &#xA0;They kept a distance of 10 meters from the food cart. &#xA0;It looked as if all the media outlets from around the world was there.</span></p><p><span style="">There was only one person in the world, who attracted this many reporters.</span></p><p><span style="">The sounds of the camera shutters were going off continuously, but no one was able to approach any closer.</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin was eating an oden stick in front of a food cart.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;This one is pretty good.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Please try some of the soup.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Woo-soonghoon poured the oden soup into a paper cup, and he handed it to Woojin.</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin looked at Sunggoo, Haesol, Blanka and Melody. &#xA0;They were standing there doing nothing.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;You guys should eat.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What? Aren&#x2019;t we heading immediately towards the Dungeon?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;We are heading out, but we have to wait for one more person to join us.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Uh, hyung-nim? Is someone else supposed to be here?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">At Sunggoo&apos;s question, Woojin&apos;s gaze headed towards Woo-soonghoon.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Did you contact him?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes, I contacted him.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">After a moment, a large figure pushed past the reporters.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yo, brother Kahng.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Bake-hyung is here?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">A smiling Baek-jungdo was approaching with his secretary Jung-chansung in tow.</span></p><p><span style="">Baek-jungdoh looked very casual as he put an oden in his mouth.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Uh? What&apos;s president Baek doing here?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Baek-jongdoh grinned at Sunggoo&apos;s question.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What am I doing here? &#xA0;We are one team now. One team. &#xA0;Ooh-haha.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Ah. The president must have called him here.</span></p><p><span style="">It seemed he had taken a real liking to Baek-jungdo, since he allowed Baek-jungdo to join the expedition.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ah. We were short on a Tanker.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Sunggoo had a confused expression on his face when he heard Woojin&apos;s words.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What about me?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Woojin smirked as he drank the oden soup.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;You have to train separately.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;oohk.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">He was going to be dead soon!</span></p><p><span style="">Sunggoo looked as if he was about to cry. &#xA0;Woojin&apos;s gaze headed towards Haesol.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;We have someone who can kite, and she can double as a communication apparatus.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">He laughed as he looked at Blanka.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;We also have backup Tanker, who can heal and cast Buffs.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Woojin opened his mouth when his eyes met Melody&apos;s eyes.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;We also have a healer, who can sustain other&apos;s life.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">When Woojin&apos;s words ended, there was a twinkle in Sunggoo&apos;s eyes.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;You don&apos;t have a damage dealer, hyung-nim. &#xA0;As expected, I&apos;ll...&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I&#x2019;ve already brought in someone else. &#xA0;You&#x2019;ll be trained separately.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hoo-oohk&#x2026;&#x2026;.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">He couldn&apos;t escape this. Ah, he was already scared.</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin ate the rest of the oden on the skewer, and he looked at Soonghoon.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;How much do I have to give you?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;It is $100.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Huh. One is worth $20?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Soonghoon grumbled as he gave the money to the lady. &#xA0;Then they headed towards the entrance of the Seoul Station&apos;s 1st Exit. &#xA0;When they left, the reporters crowded around the food cart.</span></p><p><span style="">Click, click.</span></p><p><span style="">They were absorbed in taking pictures of the bamboo skewers left behind after Woojin ate his oden, and they also took pictures of the food cart. &#xA0;One didn&apos;t need to see the article to guess the title of the articles they would upload.</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin discreetly asked Soonghoon as he watched ruckus he left behind.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Are we on Korean land right now?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Try buying up everything here.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Soonghoon grinned.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;As expected. &#xA0;President thought $20 was too excessive for a single oden. &#xA0;I&apos;ll immediately buy up the nearby land, and I&apos;ll hit them up with taxes.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Ddah-ahk. </span></p><p><span style="">Woojin smacked the back of Soonghoon&apos;s head.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Do you think I am you? &#xA0;I just want you to purchase the land near here. I don&apos;t know what I&apos;ll bring through the Dungeon. &#xA0;I need more space.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes&#x2026;.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Soonghoon rubbed the back of his head as he attended the group to the Dungeon&apos;s entrance.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Please be safe on your trip, president.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">As a senior executive of the KH guild, Jung-chansung looked at Baek-jungdo with worry. &#xA0;Baek-jungdo let out his unique laugh as he slapped Jung-chansung&apos;s shoulder.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ha ha ha. &#xA0;You are worrying too much. &#xA0;I&apos;m going with lil bro Kahng. &#xA0;He is earth&apos;s strongest.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&apos;That is why I&apos;m worried, president&apos;</span></p><p><span style="">The party entered the Dungeon as they received a highly worried gaze from Jung-chansung.</span></p><p><span style="">After seeing them off, Woo-soonghoon thrust his hand forward. &#xA0;As if to ask the meaning of this gesture, Jung-chansung met Woo-soonghoon&apos;s gaze.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What is the meaning of this?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;President Baek ate one oden. &#xA0;That&apos;ll be $20.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;you are suppose to be the minister of foreign affairs.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Uh-uh. That doesn&apos;t mean I can&apos;t be thorough with my calculations.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;&#x2026;.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Woo-soonghoon had 8 years of experience as a salesman before he turned his life around.</span></p><p><span style="">Woo-soonghoon&apos;s calculation was sharp like a knife. &#xA0;Jung-chansung opened his wallet.</span></p><p><span style="">*** </span></p><p><span style="">There was a veil around the Seoul Station&apos;s 1st Exit.</span></p><p><span style="">The Dungeon in question was a topic of many conversations.</span></p><p><span style="">After Kahng-woojin cleared it, endless supply of Artifacts had come out. &#xA0;It was also the site where he murdered a man and the body was illegally disposed of inside the Dungeon. &#xA0;It was a Dungeon that was a subject to a lot of wild rumors.</span></p><p><span style="">Of course, only a few select people knew its real identity.</span></p><p><span style="">It was Kahng-woojin&apos;s Dimensional Domain.</span></p><p><span style="">The only one who had no idea about this fact was Blanka.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Uh, president? The portal is&#x2026;.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">When Woojin entered the Dungeon, the Dungeon was instructed not to regenerate the monsters. Blanka became puzzled when the red portal, which was connected to the Dimensional Domain, appeared immediately in front of them.</span></p><p><span style="">Moreover, the president wasn&apos;t courteous enough to resolve Blanka&apos;s confusion.</span></p><p><span style="">Shoo-shoo-shook.</span></p><p><span style="">When Woojin passed through the portal, the rest of the party entered the portal one by one.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Mmmm.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">When Blanka passed through the portal, he found himself in a building with a high ceiling. &#xA0;It was a large hall that one might see at a palace, and there was a throne in front of his eyes.</span></p><p><span style="">Moreover, there were three red portals next to the seat.</span></p><p><span style="">Blanka was looking around when his gaze landed on Woojin, who was sitting on the throne.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I want to welcome you all to the Dimensional Domain of Alandal.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">The group members felt a peculiar flutter at Woojin&apos;s laugh.</span></p><p><span style="">There had been a new breed of monster that appeared in the world. &#xA0;These monsters were able to command other monsters, and a nickname was given to them.</span></p><p><span style="">Monster lords. &#xA0;This was what everyone was calling the Dimensional lords.</span></p><p><span style="">Every Roused in Alandal knew Woojin possessed a Dungeon and he was a Dimensional lord. &#xA0;Of course, everyone except Blanka.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;T...that can&apos;t be.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Huh huh. &#xA0;It seems my foreign friend and I were the only people in the dark here.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Even Baek-jungdo didn&apos;t know Woojin&apos;s true nature. &#xA0;He knew Woojin could use a Dungeon, but he never expected Woojin to be a Dimensional lord...</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I&apos;ll give you one hour to tour the palace. &#xA0;You can go sightsee.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Huh huh. Is this place really a Dimensional Domain, lil bro Kahng?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;If you have any questions, ask Bibi about it.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Woojin had work to do on his throne.</span></p><p><span style="">Bibi used short steps to run towards the party, and she looked at them.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Heh heh. &#xA0;Please follow me. &#xA0;I&apos;ll give you a tour.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">When everyone followed Bibi out of the castle, Jaemin came forward. &#xA0;He had been hiding in the darkness.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;You are a man. &#xA0;Why do you get so shy all the time?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ha ha. &#xA0;I have no idea.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">It still felt strange to Jaemin. &#xA0;He was a Vampire instead of a human. &#xA0;He was having a hard time overcoming that dissonance, so what would other people think? &#xA0;He was a bit short on courage to be able to stand confidently in front of others.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Chet. What about the stuff I wanted you to learn?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I learned it all.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Woojin had bought several dozen skill with his Points.</span></p><p><span style="">There were a lot of Skill only the Vampire Class could learn.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;It is a totally different matter as to whether you can use those Skills properly.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I&apos;m practicing right now.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Reality is harsh. You won&#x2019;t have much time to practice.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I&apos;m trying.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I find your trying to be lacking.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I&apos;m tryyyyyyyyyyying?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">A vein popped out on Woojin&apos;s forehead.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;You want me to hit you?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I&apos;m sorry.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;We&apos;ll depart for Planet Jaku in an hour.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Jaemin was surprised.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I arranged for you to have the best teammates possible. &#xA0;You should roll with them.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">He&apos;ll immediately be put into a live battle&#x2026;. </span></p><p><span style="">Jaemin had an expression full of worry, so Woojin spoke bluntly to him.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Do you want to whine again as you stay on the sideline?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;&#x2026;.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">He had to be strong.</span></p><p><span style="">If he wanted to protect his family and the one he loves....</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;The party is set up in a manner where you won&apos;t die...&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Ah. His hyung-nim was so considerate to arrange everything for him like this.</span></p><p><span style="">He&apos;ll be in a party consisting of Rank A Roused, so he&#x2019;ll just be carried around.</span></p><p><span style="">As if Woojin had read his thought, Woojin couldn&apos;t help, but smirk.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;...if you do well.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;&#x2026;.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;If you don&apos;t do well, your party will be wiped out.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;&#x2026;.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Even if you die, I can revive you. &#xA0;However, if the others die, it is the end of the road for them.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Ah, why is he putting such a heavy burden on him? &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">Jaemin&apos;s chin shook as the weight of the burden was overwhelming.</span></p><p><span style="">He was the damage dealer, so if he was unreliable... In the end, his party might be wiped out.</span></p><p><span style="">He had no idea what was waiting for him on Planet Jaku.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Let us make the protection wall before we go.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes, hyung.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">The Domain&apos;s Protection Period was about to come to an end. &#xA0;He needed time to do his Dimensional battle. &#xA0;This was why he had given his party 1 hour to do as they liked. &#xA0;Jaemin sat in the chair, and Woojin immediately started to search for an opponent.</span></p><p><span style="">The identity of the opponent didn&apos;t matter. &#xA0;He made a half-hearted effort at finding an opponent before he selected a match for Jaemin. Jaemin could win or lose. &#xA0;Either result was great either for Woojin. &#xA0;Instead of watching the Dimensional battle, he looked over the status of his Domain.</span></p><p><span style="">Three portals had formed beside the Throne.</span></p><p><span style="">&lt;Planet Earth - Seoul Station&apos;s 1st Exit&gt; </span></p><p><span style="">&lt;Planet Jaku - Necia&apos;s Pillar&gt; </span></p><p><span style="">&lt;Planet Alphen - Raht&apos;s Temple&gt; </span></p><p><span style="">Several hundred temples had existed in various parts of Alphen.</span></p><p><span style="">Each of them had been turned into a Dungeon. Several of them had existed within his old territory of Alandal. &#xA0;This was why his Undead army &#xA0;had endless battle with the beings from Trahnet.</span></p><p><span style="">&lt;The Dimensional Domain is synchronizing with Planet Alphen. You have 20 days and 17 hours left....&gt; </span></p><p><span style="">He had purchased the Dungeon on Alphen using a single Dimensional Fragment.</span></p><p><span style="">He planned on sweeping the Planet Jaku before &#xA0;he made his return.</span></p><p><span style="">It would great if he reached level 90, but it wouldn&#x2019;t matter if he didn&#x2019;t reach it.</span></p><p><span style="">He didn&#x2019;t care about the Yellow Lizard coalition or any other organizations. &#xA0;This was a declaration of war on all the Dimensional lords.</span></p><p><span style="">If they touched earth, it didn&#x2019;t matter if they were a Dimensional lord or a coalition. He&#x2019;ll clearly show them the cost associated with the move.</span></p><p><span style="">*** </span></p><p><span style="">The party gathered around the portal that would lead to the Necia&apos;s Pillar.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Are you all ready?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes! &#xA0;We are ready.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Woojin looked at the group gathered in front of him.</span></p><p><span style="">Sunggoo and Jaenis would be doing their own thing, so they were excluded from the party. &#xA0;There was the Tamer Haesol, Buffer Blanka, Body Reinforcement Roused Baek-jungdo, Healer Melody, and the blossoming Vampire Do-jaemin.</span></p><p><span style="">If they get used to working each other, this was a team able to take down most Dimensional lords. &#xA0;Of course, this hinged on Do-jaemin&#x2019;s rapid development.</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin asked for everyone&apos;s attention.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Let him suck on anything that looks decent.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;&#x2026;.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Do-jaemin looked as if he was about to cry. &#xA0;He had to drink the blood of a monster in front of others....</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;You don&apos;t want to become stronger?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;It isn&apos;t like that.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Do-jaemin was a vampire. </span></p><p><span style="">He hadn&apos;t increased his Stats through the normal Reinforcement stones.</span></p><p><span style="">Dead warriors and magicians.... One had to drink the blood of the defeated enemies for one to be able to absorb their power. &#xA0;This was how Vampires increased their Stats. &#xA0;&#xA0;If one considered the number of enemies he would kill and drink here...</span></p><p><span style="">This was the reason why Woojin expected rapid growth from Jaemin, and it was one of the core reasons why he created this party.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;All right. &#xA0;When you guys pass through the Dungeon, you all are on your own. &#xA0;&#xA0;Contact me if you run into something unusual.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes!&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Woojin had put Sunggoo and Jaenis together, so he had a method of contacting them. As the Domain&apos;s Strategist, Woojin was able to contact Do-jaemin even if he was in a different dimension.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;All right. &#xA0;Let&apos;s go.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Woojin activated the portal heading towards Necia&apos;s Dungeon, and he passed through the portal.</span></p><p><span style="">It was his first time visiting the Planet Jaku.</span></p><p><span style="">Zeeeeeeeng.</span></p><p><span style="">When he passed through the portal, there was an enormous pillar, and it was surrounded by a wide barrier that looked like a fountain. It seemed the barrier was formed when the challenger entered a fixed territory.</span></p><p><span style="">It was structured a bit differently from earth&apos;s subway stations, but it was used the same way.</span></p><p><span style="">The barrier faded when Woojin appeared. &#xA0;It seemed this was the result of completing his synchronization.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;If we are on earth, wouldn&#x2019;t we be treated like monsters?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">This was exactly the same as the Dungeon Breaks on earth except they were the invaders now.</span></p><p><span style="">Was it because it had been a while? &#xA0;Woojin&apos;s heart beat faster and he felt a weird sense of thrill.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I&apos;ll kill them all.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">It felt as if earth&apos;s Kahng-woojin had returned to being the Immortal.</span></p><p><span style="">He went across the boundary of the Dungeon. </span></p><p><span style="">Koo-roo-rook. </span></p><p><span style="">Goo-rook, goo-rook, goo-rook.</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin was greeted by various species that let out strange sounds.</span></p><p><span style="">Amongst them, a green Lizard Man approached as he slithered on his snake-like body.</span></p><p><span style="">It wore a black crown on its head. &#xA0;It looked ridiculous, but the atmosphere around it couldn&apos;t be ignored.</span></p><p><span style="">The party was nervous, but Woojin walked forward to meet this being.</span></p><p><span style="">[I welcome you, warrior!] </span></p><p><span style="">[Who are you?] </span></p><p><span style="">[My name is Nigal. &#xA0;I&apos;m a Dimensional lord serving the Chen-nim, who is the leader of the Black Hat coalition.] </span></p><p><span style="">[Were you waiting for me?] </span></p><p><span style="">[Yes! I heard about your exploits in eradicating the Yellow Lizards. &#xA0;Chen-nim is waiting for you. &#xA0;He will give you a very high seat...] </span></p><p><span style="">Paht. </span></p><p><span style="">Woojin summoned his Warrior&apos;s Weapon, and it was in the shape of an Axe.</span></p><p><span style="">Hoooong. &#xA0;Kwah-jeek! </span></p><p><span style="">Lizard man Nigal&apos;s head flew into the air, then it rolled onto the floor.</span></p><p><span style="">Even as his head was separated from its body, its eyes rolled to look at Woojin.</span></p><p><span style="">[&#x2026;&#x2026;what is the meaning of this?] </span></p><p><span style="">[What&apos;s this? It is a start to a party.] </span></p><p><span style="">The corner of Woojin&apos;s mouth lifted, and he was grinning.</span></p><p><span style="">Afterwards, the Undead army started to be summoned behind him.</span></p>
