These were rare crafting items that was hard to find even on Alphen yet they were pouring out right now.</span></p><p><span style="">The most numerous items were the bars of metal, and magical crystals. However, a large amount of other rare materials was also extracted.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;If I&#x2019;m lucky, then I could probably make my old equipment.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">The equipment he had used on Alandal. It aided in his magic, and It also assisted in controlling the Undead. If he could regain all of his equipment, he could probably recreate his Undead Army on earth.</span></p><p><span style="">No. He needed it.</span></p><p><span style="">There was a limit on how much he can increase his Stat using Bonus Stats and Reinforcement Stones. If he could get all of his equipment, he would be 3 times or more powerful then his normal self.</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin looked through Point Store index to find the equipment he had used before.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Three million Achievement Points?&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin&#x2019;s mouth fell open when he saw the price of his old equipment. It wasn&#x2019;t something he could acquire using only Achievement Points. Fortunately, the recipe to make the equipments was available for purchase at a price of 10,000 Points.</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin decided to purchase one.</span></p><p><span style="">&lt;Thrash&#x2019;s Honor&gt;</span></p><p><span style="">A helmet imbued with the God of Destruction Thrash&#x2019;s power.</span></p><p><span style="">Ingredient : Dragon Heart(1), White Gold Ingot(3), Vampire&#x2019;s Heart(2)&#x2026;.</span></p><p><span style="">There were over 20 ingredients listed, so he looked for the material inside the Achievement Point Store. The price of the ingredients varied, but when summed, he needed around 4 million points.</span></p><p><span style="">It would be much better to buy the already made item rather then making it himself through buying the ingredients with Achievement Points.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;I&#x2019;ll try to gather the ingredients, and if I have no choice, I&#x2019;ll have to buy it from the Store.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">He&#x2019;ll gather ingredients as best as he could, then he&#x2019;ll buy only couple ingredients he can&#x2019;t find from the Point Store. This way he&#x2019;ll be able to make the items at a cheaper cost. Woojin purchased the God of Destruction Thrash&#x2019;s other set items.</span></p><p><span style="">&lt;Thrash&#x2019;s Protection&gt;</span></p><p><span style="">&lt;Thrash&#x2019;s Dignity&gt;</span></p><p><span style="">&lt;Thrash&#x2019;s Punishment&gt;</span></p><p><span style="">&lt;Thrash&#x2019;s March&gt;</span></p><p><span style="">He bought the recipe for the armor, belt, glove and boots. Then he checked all the ingredients.</span></p><p><span style="">There was a limit to how much ingredients he could earn using item extraction. Currently, he wasn&#x2019;t able to make even one of his equipment.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Well, I&#x2019;m not in a hurry yet.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">He&#x2019;ll slowly scope out the market, and he&#x2019;ll gather ingredients during his hunt. If that isn&#x2019;t enough, he could break down Artifacts that&#x2019;s being traded.</span></p><p><span style="">After his employees finished sorting the items, Woojin gathered them around him.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;It&#x2019;ll be impossible for you to solo a 4 star. Go around the 3 star Dungeons, Sunggoo.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes, hyung-nim. I&#x2019;ve already finished making appointments.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">His goal wasn&#x2019;t excavating bloodstones. He was clearing the Dungeons to practice and advance his abilities. In recent days, it felt as if he was finally getting a pay off for his past manual labor job of extracting bloodstones.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Haemin. You should take good care of Sunggoo.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Of course&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Sunggoo was Rank C right now, and he would be a Rank B Roused soon. Sunggoo was growing into an expert, who would be treated well even in the large guilds. No one would treat him carelessly anymore.</span></p><p><span style="">Haemin, who was an employee of the support division, had become close friends with Director Hong-sunggoo, so he was never negligent in supporting Sunggoo.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Minchan. What about my ticket to the US?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;It&#x2019;s all been taken care of. You will be leaving in a week from today.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes. Well, you do everything well on your own initiative.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Minchan didn&#x2019;t having any additional words to add to that statement. Minchan was embarrassed yet proud of Woojin&#x2019;s praise. Unlike his stint in the Hammer Guild, Minchan managed everything that went on in Alandal.</span></p><p><span style="">He couldn&#x2019;t help but feel a sense of fulfillment in his work.</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin looked at the gaunt face of Woo-soonghoon.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;You should take care of your hangover.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;yes.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin gave orders to all of his employees. He was about to head out as he turned his back towards them.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Oh yeah. I chose a new member for the guild. She is a Rank F, and she&#x2019;ll be coming by soon.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">This was a pretty big news for them, so their curiosity was piqued. Woojin grinned.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;You&#x2019;ll see later. Well, work hard.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Have a nice day, president.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Have a nice day.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin left as he received farewells from his employees. He made a call to Jiwon.</span></p><p><span style="">[Hey, Woojin.]</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Author Do. Where are you?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">[Ai. What? I&#x2019;m at the cafe.]</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I&#x2019;ll be there soon.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">[No. I will head out right now. Let&#x2019;s meet at the front.]</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;All right. Let&#x2019;s do that.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin ended his call, then he headed towards Angel Angel.</span></p><p><span style="">While he was crossing the street, he saw Do-jiwon come out of the cafe.</span></p><p><span style="">When she saw Woojin, she waved her hand with a radiant face. She was exceptionally beautiful today.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Let&#x2019;s go. My mother and sister should be at the restaurant.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What should I do? I&#x2019;m really nervous.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;It&#x2019;s just lunch.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Jiwon couldn&#x2019;t hide her nervousness even when she heard Woojin&#x2019;s words.</span></p><p><span style="">In Korea, it was a bit of a special occasion when one meets the significant other&#x2019;s parents.</span></p><p><span style="">When Woojin and Jiwon walked side-by-side, the surrounding pedestrians couldn&#x2019;t help but glance at them at least once.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Wow. Awesome.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;She&#x2019;s really pretty.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Doesn&#x2019;t the guy look familiar?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;That guy? I have no idea. Who cares?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Jiwon was so pretty that she was the center of everyone&#x2019;s attention. It even made people not recognize the face of a Rank AA Roused, who was frequently on tv these days.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;It&#x2019;s over there. Let&#x2019;s go in.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hoo-ooh.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Jiwon took a deep breath to shed her nervousness. Jiwon and Woojin entered the appointed restaurant together.</span></p><p><span style="">*</span></p><p><span style="">Therer was a saying that said pretty teachers were popular amongst children in kindergarten. It seemed those talks were true.</span></p><p><span style="">Sooah asked endless questions toward Jiwon, and her conversation made the dinner quite amicable.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;After seeing you on tv, I was very curious. I had to meet you at least once. Thank you for coming out here.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;No, mother. I&#x2019;m really grateful you invited me. Please speak freely.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ah-whew. No. You are still someone else&#x2019;s precious daughter.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">It seemed his mother was quite taken with Jiwon. After a short lunch, she immediately stood up with Sooah.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;We&#x2019;ll be going. Please continue your date.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">As if she didn&#x2019;t want to bother them, she left after a brief lunch. Woojin put on a wry smile as he watched his mother leave. His mother didn&#x2019;t want to interfere with his love life. She was satisfied after meeting with the woman he was dating.</span></p><p><span style="">His family really just ate a quick lunch, then they left. It almost made Jiwon feel silly for being so nervous.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;We have a lot of time left. Don&#x2019;t we have a meeting at dinner time? Who&#x2019;s coming?</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yeah. Do you know who Nahm-jihyuhk and Park-sohee is?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Those names seems familiar.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Jihyuhk said he used to be close to you&#x2026;.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ah. Is that so? Then I&#x2019;ll probably get along with him again. What should we do until the evening? Do you want to go watch a movie??&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yeah. Let&#x2019;s do that.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;All right. Let&#x2019;s walk there.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The theater was one subway station away.</span></p><p><span style="">As they walked, Woojin grabbed Jiwon&#x2019;s hand and her cheeks became red.</span></p><p><span style="">*</span></p><p><span style="">Inside a black van.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Whew. I really hate this.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Cindy, who was part of a 4 member girl group named Yuri Girls, let out a sigh.</span></p><p><span style="">Her manager laughed as he spoke.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Heh heh. You have to paddle when the tide comes in. Let&#x2019;s hurry up and go. The director is waiting for us.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Uh-whew. Will the number of people who watch this movie increase if we do this?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;It&#x2019;s all about portraying a certain image. Do you really think everything ends after the filming ends? We all have to work hard to promote the film. What would they say if the main heroine didn&#x2019;t show up on stage? Even if the number of people who&#x2019;ll watch this movie won&#x2019;t increase, you&#x2019;ll gain more fans.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ah. I want to rest.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">It had been 6 years since Yuri Girls debuted, and their popularity was in decline after being pushed by the younger girl groups. However, Cindy was still popular as ever, and she was too busy to eat and sleep.</span></p><p><span style="">She had successfully transitioned into an actress. This movie will allow her to reach a new zenith in her acting career.</span></p><p><span style="">She&#x2019;ll be hitting her prime.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Let&#x2019;s hurry up and go.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;All right.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Cindy put on her sunglasses, then she exited the car after the road manager opened the door. She had naturally high cheekbones, and she put on a gorgeous smile. However, the expected crowd wasn&#x2019;t in front of her van.</span></p><p><span style="">Usually, even if they kept her whereabouts a secret, the fans would show up like swarms of clouds. However, she didn&#x2019;t see any of those fans. The security personnel, who had been waiting for Cindy, greeted her.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Oppa. I think we were too secretive.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I&#x2026;I guess so.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The manager was also a little bit taken aback by this situation.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;This might better, since we can relax. Let&#x2019;s hurry up and go.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Cindy went into the ready room with the security personnel, and she saw that the room was crowded near one side.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What&#x2019;s going on over there? Did another team other than ours show up?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Huh? Wait a second. I&#x2019;ll go check it out.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">After the manager quickly ran towards the crowd, he came back not too long afterward, and he made a great fuss.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Wa. Jackpot!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;It&#x2019;s Kahng-woojin! Kahn-woojin came to see the movie.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Is that so?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Cindy knew who Kahng-woojin was. He was a Roused, who was much more popular than celebrities.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Oppa.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Huh?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Go get me his number.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Cindy&#x2019;s words made the manager&#x2019;s brow furrow. His face suddenly stiffened, and he exuded his disapproval.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hey. Why are you being like this again? We can&#x2019;t have a scandal again.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Oppa. Did I say I was going to date him? I just want to build a friendly relationship with him. Hurry up and get his contact information.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hey, I have to keep my promise to the president&#x2026;&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Do you want me to go there myself? Wouldn&#x2019;t people recognize me?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">That would cause more trouble.</span></p><p><span style="">The reporters probably would love such a situation, and they would flock toward them.</span></p><p><span style="">The manager tried to find another excuse.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hey. He has a girlfriend by his side.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ha-ah.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Cindy let out a sigh then she lowered her sunglasses slightly. She looked at her manager with eyes filled with confidence.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Oppa. I&#x2019;m Cindy. Cindy. Yuri Girl&#x2019;s Cindy.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;&#x2026;.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Ah. She was a good actress, and she worked diligently. She behaved in a pleasant manner towards the staff. He liked everything about her except the fact that she acted as if being a celebrity was a position that gave her power.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Do you want me to go there myself?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;N&#x2026;no. I&#x2019;ll go.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Before a bigger incident could happen, the manager quickly burrowed through the dense crowd. After he returned, Cindy could guess what had happened when she saw his expression.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What? You couldn&#x2019;t get it?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;uh.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Did you tell him you are Cindy&#x2019;s manager?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I did.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;He still didn&#x2019;t give it to you?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;He said who is she&#x2026;&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;&#x2026;.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">At her manager&#x2019;s words, she saw the security personnel trying to hold back their laughter. Cindy adjusted her sunglasses, then she walked in a calm manner.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Huh. He doesn&#x2019;t know about me? He turned me down?&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">Cindy was barely able to hold herself back when her pride was trampled. She moved towards the ready room prepared for her by the theater. After she greeted the director and the other main actors, she went into the theater to greet her fans from the stage.</span></p><p><span style="">*</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin held up his ticket as they entered, and he whispered towards Jiwon.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;We are fortunate I still had the cancelled tickets.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I guess. Aren&#x2019;t you uncomfortable with this situation, Woojin?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Why?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;People will mob you&#x2026;&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin grinned at Jiwon&#x2019;s words.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ah. I&#x2019;m used to it. Are you uncomfortable? Do you want to wear a mask again?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Pbbt. No. I&#x2019;m fine.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Jiwon couldn&#x2019;t help, but laugh when she thought about the masks.</span></p><p><span style="">When her face was damaged, people looked at her with pity and disgust in their eyes. She could tolerate the stares and interest people showed her now. No, it actually brought up old feelings she had buried.</span></p><p><span style="">During her high school days, she had been called a goddess, and she was the center of everyone&#x2019;s attention.</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin and Jiwon got in their seats, and they ignored the glances everyone was giving them. They waited for the movie to start.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Uh? I guess it&#x2019;s a stage greeting.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Jiwon was lucky, since advanced reservation was needed to view the stage greeting. Her eyes twinkled.</span></p><p><span style="">The director and celebrities came in, and they started to introduce themselves.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Nice to meet you. I&#x2019;m Murim Heroine&#x2019;s director Lee-jaehong.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hello. I&#x2019;m Murim Heroine&#x2019;s main character, Cindy.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hello. My name is Che-jaesong. My role was a warrior in charge of guarding Ms. Cindy.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">As she watched the celebrities give stock greetings, an old memory surfaced within Jiwon.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Do you remember Cindy over there? She was in the same year as us in high school. She was the trainee in class 8.&#x201D; (TLN: trainee for the talent agency)</span></p><p><span style="">He couldn&#x2019;t even remember his friends from his own class, so how could he remember a person from a different class? He vaguely remembered there used to be a girl who had been a trainee&#x2026;.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Is that so? I don&#x2019;t remember her.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Heh. She&#x2019;s probably the most successful alumni. No. I guess you are more successful now?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Successful my ass.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin was grinning when his eyes met Cindy&#x2019;s gaze.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Uh? Isn&#x2019;t she looking towards us? Did she recognize you?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Maybe.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">When Jiwon went to the restroom, the manager had approached him to ask for his phone number&#x2026; He didn&#x2019;t feel too good about it.</span></p><p><span style="">Cindy continued to stare directly at Woojin, and she brought up the microphone to her mouth.</span></p><p></p></div><p></p>
