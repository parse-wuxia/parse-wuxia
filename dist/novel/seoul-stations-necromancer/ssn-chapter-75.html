<p><strong>Chapter 75 Meeting (2).</strong></p><div id="chapterContent" class="innerContent fr-view"><p><span style="">Chapter 75 &#x2013; Meeting (2)</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p><p><span style="">After hearing the news, Melody was so surprised that she went searching for her goddess.</span></p><p><span style="">She knelt in front of Aria&apos;s statue.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Oh goddess... That man saved other people.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">The unbelievable part was the method that he had used to save the people.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;He... His body... He put his body in front of other people&#x2026; &quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Even as she said it, she couldn&apos;t believe her words.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;It might be someone else... Yes. It can&apos;t be him&#x2026; &#x201C;</span></p><p><span style="">Melody&apos;s head was dizzy from the confusion. He looked exactly like the Immortal in her memories, yet he did something that she would have never imagined him doing. She was confused as to whether he was the same person or not.</span></p><p><span style="">Her anxiety overlapped over more anxiety, and she felt an enormous amount of stress.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;He&apos;s someone else. Someone else&#x2026; &#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">She&apos;d rather wished that was the case.</span></p><p><span style="">Melody prayed to her goddess, but there was no answer forthcoming.</span></p><p><span style="">*</span></p><p><span style="">Minchan wore a clean suit, but his expression looked gloomy. He was waiting for the Titan Guild&apos;s car. He had come out ahead of the appointed time.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Director Jung.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ah, senior vice president Jung.&#x201C;</span></p><p><span style="">Jung-chansung exited the hotel that was across the street. Afterwards, Baek-jungdo appeared, and he greeted Minchan.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;There&apos;s no news about Woojin yet?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Haha. He&apos;ll probably contact us soon.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What could go wrong? Isn&apos;t he the greatest Roused of Korea? Hahaha.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Haha&#x2026; &#x201C;</span></p><p><span style="">Minchan let out a weak laugh. These people didn&apos;t know Woojin&apos;s true nature. His President returned alive after being sent to a planet called Alphen. He was a person, who would charge at a missile, so why would he worry about Woojin Minchan was worried about the unnecessary misunderstandings that might happen.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;He might even think that the US carried out an attack against him.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">The missile attack happened here. This city was none other than New York. Woojin was shot at with a small missile capable of taking out a building. Minchan was sure that this would cause some misunderstandings.</span></p><p><span style="">US Department of Defense wasn&apos;t some scarecrow where they would do nothing when a missile was launched in a city like New York.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Please don&apos;t let there be any misunderstandings.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Minchan prayed that the US wasn&apos;t the aiming for Woojin. If that was true, they had basically crawled into the middle of the enemy territory.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I&apos;m probably wrong.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">When the world turned chaotic, terrorist attacks continued to occur at a frequent basis. Moreover, the Roused&#x2019;s abilities were too fantastic, and there were a lot of terrorist attacks carried out by them. The Roused possessed the ability to access the sub-dimension, so they could even carry a missile in there.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I hope president also thinks along that line.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">If he considered Wooijn&apos;s past behavior, it wouldn&apos;t be strange to see Woojin attack the Pentagon without a moment&apos;s notice.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;So where is he at&#x2026; &#x201C;</span></p><p><span style="">He was very worried. It felt like he was about to have a nervous breakdown. If he left a child unattended near a river, he wouldn&apos;t feel as nervous as this. It felt like he gave away a button capable of launching a nuke after disguising it as a children&apos;s toy.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;It&apos;ll probably be boring. Let&apos;s go together.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Baek-jungdo, Minchan, and Chansung rode in the same car. They headed towards the Titan Guild&apos;s headquarters for the appointed consortium.</span></p><p><span style="">The invitation letters were sent out to every guild in the world, and only those with the invitation letters could attend the consortium. The reporters were already gathered around the entrance, and it was like they were attending some award ceremony. They felt like celebrities.</span></p><p><span style="">The reporter and his cameraman chased their group down when the reporter realized that they were Korean. The reporter got in their party&apos;s way.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;May I interview you?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Mr. Kahng-woojin stopped a sickening terrorist attack, which might have killed a lot of innocent people, and I know that you are in the same guild as him&#x2026; &#x201C;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes. Yes.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The reporter was speaking too rapidly in English, but Minchan followed the gist of the conversation as he picked up words he knew intermittently.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Surprisingly, it seems that he is still alive. Do you know where he is? I&apos;m speculating, but I think he might have been kidnapped by the terrorists. As a fellow guild member, what are your thoughts?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;That&apos;s&#x2026; &#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Kidnapping? He didn&apos;t think that that was possible.</span></p><p><span style="">Minchan decided to give a vague answer.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Maybe, he might be watching this news. Do you have any words thay you would like to convey to Mr. Kahng-woojin?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Minchan looked into the camera as he spoke earnestly.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;President. I trusted president from the start! Where are you, president? Please come back to me.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I was wrong. I thought president made a big mess again. It was my misunderstanding. Please just return safely.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;The US government will catch the terrorists. Please just return to us, president. I beg of you. Please, before the incident become much large.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;You might cause a war by trying to catch him by yourself. Please come back.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Minchan sincerely wished for it.</span></p><p><span style="">The reporter didn&apos;t understand Minchan&apos;s words, since he was giving the message to Woojin in Korean. One of the reporter&apos;s staff approached him to hand a paper with the translated words.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes. This is quite surprising. It seems this guild member believes Mr. Kahng-woojin is currently chasing the terrorist&#x2026; &#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Uh? It was just speculation...</span></p><p><span style="">Minchan let go of the uncomfortable feeling, then he entered the entrance being guarded by a line of guards.</span></p><p><span style="">The large conference room was like the chamber for parliament. It was like an opera theater.</span></p><p><span style="">Minchan was surprised, since the Titan Guild possessed a large space like this inside their office. It just reaffirmed the fact that they were the number one guild in the US, so something like this was probably par for the course.</span></p><p><span style="">Since the seats were designated beforehand, Minchan&apos;s seat was far away from KH Guild&apos;s Baek-jongdo, and Jung-chansung. The empty seat next to him had a name card for Kahng-woojin. When he saw it, a heavier weight pressed down on Minchan&apos;s heart.</span></p><p><span style="">Soon, the Titan&apos;s guild master Deacon appeared on top of the stage.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I want to thank you from the bottom of my heart for attending this consortium.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Deacon gave a short greeting, then he looked around at the faces in attendance.</span></p><p><span style="">There were people from the Chinese, European, and Japanese Guilds. These guilds were always in competition for the right to be called the best in the world. Even Russia sent two Guilds to the meeting this time.</span></p><p><span style="">The Titan Guild had sent 4 invitations to Korea.</span></p><p><span style="">They sent it to the 3 large guilds, and Alandal.</span></p><p><span style="">Hammer, KH and Alandal were in attendance, but the Hwarang Guild was absent. Moreover, Alandal&apos;s guild master was currently missing.</span></p><p><span style="">Deacon paid special attention to the Alandal guild, since Melody spoke about them until his ears was about to fall off.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;This consortium will deal with a matter too big for the guilds to deal with alone. We will broadcast this event to ask for help from all the Roused on earth.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The consortium would be shown to the public in a couple of hours. It wasn&apos;t a live broadcast, but numerous cameras were placed inside the conference hall to film the consortium.</span></p><p><span style="">Deacon gave a short greeting and thank you to each country&apos;s guilds. Then, he shifted gear to deliver the message about the threat posed by the Dungeons and monsters. His speech heightened the tension in the room.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;The news I have is about the origin of the Dungeon, which is a mystery to mankind.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Everyone&apos;s attention was immediately focused on him.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;We were able to find out that the Dungeons are acting as a Dimensional Gate. They are currently acting as a bridge between earth and a planet called Alphen. The time difference between here and there is 4 times.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Deacon took a short breath as he looked at the surrounding people. More than hundred people were focused on him. Moreover, the cameras, which will allow numerous more people to view him, were also on him.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;The monsters of the Planet Alphen are using the bridge called the Dungeon to invade earth. Humanity has to prevent this from happening.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Someone yelled out with displeasure in his voice.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Does this mean that you want to shut down the Dungeons?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">It was a man from the Daken Guild, who had flourished from the Dungeon Business.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Even if we destroy the bridge, they will put down a new bridge. It is an impossible task. I invited all of you here to propose a single request.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">He paused before he continued speaking.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Humanity has to cross the bridge first, and we have to wipe out the monsters.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Pre-emptive strike.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Instead of fighting on earth, let us take the fight to them.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">It was an idea quite typical of an American.</span></p><p><span style="">If the war happened on Alphen, then they would surely prevent the damage caused by the Dungeon Breaks on earth.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;You keep saying that the monsters are coming from a planet called Alphen. Is that credible?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Of course. We have a living witness, who could corroborate the fact.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">When the door to the conference hall were opened, the Holy Knights entered. Everyone turned their backs to the stage to look at the door.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I would like to introduce the Holy Maiden of the Aria church. She came from the Planet Alphen to ask for earth&apos;s help.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Every Roused knew who she was. However, there was different significance in viewing her in the flesh instead of a video.</span></p><p><span style="">More Holy Knights walked behind Melody.</span></p><p><span style="">She wore a plain nun&apos;s habit that was of a slightly different style than the ones on earth. Still, the plain clothes couldn&apos;t hide her elegance and beauty.</span></p><p><span style="">She slowly walked down the center aisle of the conference room towards the stage. Hamilton followed behind her.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I am the Holy Maiden of the Aria church. My name is Melody.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The people inside the conference room became restless once again when they heard her beautiful voice.</span></p><p><span style="">Melody hadn&apos;t slept at all yesterday night, but she was still beautiful and overflowing with life. If they accepted her speech, she would be able to save her allies suffering on Alphen.</span></p><p><span style="">She had put her life on the line to come here for that sole purpose.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I am earnestly asking for your help to insure Earth&apos;s safety and peace. Please, help me free Alphen.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Unlike her words, her attitude was dignified, and her expression was haughty. She had the goddess&apos; protection, so an unknown air of dignity flowed off her entire body.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Please give us some proof. You said you are a Holy Maiden from the Alphen Planet, but you are only a mere Roused on this planet.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">It was still the man from Japan&apos;s Daken Guild. It seemed that he didn&apos;t welcome the current staus quo changing. It was understandable, since Japan boasted the most numerous number of subway stations.</span></p><p><span style="">There were a lot of casualties, but it was also a new business opportunity. The Dungeon Business was most active in Japan. The Mecca of Dungeon Business leading the world was Japan.</span></p><p><span style="">Melody stepped forward on the stage.</span></p><p><span style="">A mere Roused?</span></p><p><span style="">She was of the 9th Circle. If she converted the term into Earth&apos;s Rank, she was a Rank SS Cleric.</span></p><p><span style="">Melody opened both of her arms wide. Light shone from her body, and it filled the conference room. The holy and warm light swept through the entire conference room, and it gave a buff to every single person in attendance.</span></p><p><span style="">The Roused clearly felt the change, and even the normal people&apos;s bodies were filled with vitality.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Isn&apos;t that proof enough?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">She was haughty and dignified. Those words personified her. The person from the Daken Guild let out a moan, but he wasn&apos;t to be deterred. He continued to find fault with her words.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;You will have to clear my misgivings. Monsters crawl out of the Dungeons. However, a humans can only come back out when they enter a Dungeon.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The Dimensional Fragment named the Return Stone was a key used to reach Earth. However, the Return Stones weren&apos;t the only Dimensional Fragments in existence. There were keys that allowed one to head to Alphen.</span></p><p><span style="">She had formed the Holy Knights to search for it.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;The way will be opened by the me and the Holy Knights. For the safety of earth, you all will have to head towards Alphen. If you hesitate, Earth will be turned in a desolate land like Alphen. It will happen in short order. This is a war to stop Earth&apos;s destruction.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The heart of some people heated up at the Holy Maiden&apos;s words. Some started pounding on their calculators. Not everyone would join the war from a sense of duty. Those people moved only for money.</span></p><p><span style="">She didn&apos;t care what their reasons was.</span></p><p><span style="">Melody felt relieved as she looked over the people. Her goddess&apos; words were right.</span></p><p><span style="">There were saviors here on earth. These people would once again regain the freedom of the Planet Alphen.</span></p><p><span style="">As the door to the conference room opened, a raucous sound leaked in from outside. Between the open door, an Asian man wearing a black sweat suit was standing there. One corner of his mouth lifted into a smirk, and he had a mischievous expression on his face.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Stop spouting bullshit.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">He walked slowly into the conference room. He followed the center path to walk a straight line towards the stage.</span></p><p><span style="">He was slow, and very languid.</span></p><p><span style="">Everyone inside the conference room focused their gazes on the man.</span></p><p><span style="">Some were glad to see him. Some showed curiosity, and there were even some uncomfortable gazes pouring toward the sweat-suit wearing Kahng-woojin.</span></p><p><span style="">Melody stood atop the stage.</span></p><p><span style="">She was shaking like a leaf.</span></p><p><span style="">It worsened as Woojin approached her one step at a time.</span></p><p><span style="">It felt like Melody&apos;s heart was dropping step by step towards the floor.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;It is him.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">It felt as if she going crazy.</span></p><p><span style="">He was really on earth...</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin stopped in front of the stage. He looked up at Melody&apos;s face. She seemed to be in a state of panic.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Isn&apos;t this quite awkward?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;... &#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">She couldn&apos;t reply since she was too afraid. How many people were killed in front of that smiling face?</span></p><p><span style="">If he was one&apos;s ally, one felt anxiety. If one became his enemy, this man was a calamity.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I would have never thought that I would have the occasion to look up at you.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026; !&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The very surprised Holy Maiden Melody got off the stage. The haughty woman moved without any grace. She scrambled down the stage to stand in front of Woojin.</span></p><p><span style="">Then.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Melody started to slowly lower herself to the floor.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;The King, who rules over the Undead Army&#x2026; &#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Alphen&apos;s language flowed out from Melody&apos;s lips. One of her knees touched the floor.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;God of Destruction Thrash&apos;s Champion&#x2026; &#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Then her other knee touched the floor, and she knelt on the floor.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Alandal&apos;s Monarch&#x2026;.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">She started to slowly bend her waist forward.</span></p><p><span style="">Her two trembling hands grabbed Woojin&apos;s sneakers.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;The Undying&#x2026; Immortal&#x2026; &#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Her lips touched Woojin&apos;s shoes for a brief moment before her lips fell away.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Aria&apos;s lowly servant&#x2026; &#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Melody retreated backwards as she walked on her knees. Then, she lowered herself forward as if she was giving a kowtow.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;... gives greetings to you.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin let out a bright smile as he looked down at her.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;It&apos;s been awhile. Right?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">This was the first meeting between him and his friend, who had come all the way from Alphen to earth.</span></p><p></p></div><p></p>
