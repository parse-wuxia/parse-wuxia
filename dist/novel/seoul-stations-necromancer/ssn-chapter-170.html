<p><span style="">Chapter 170 - Oracle (1)</span></p><p><span style="">Poo-hoo-hoo!</span></p><p><span style="">The water from the lake flew into the air as if it was ascending into the heavens. &#xA0;Each Breath let out by the Water Dragons were streams of water. &#xA0;Each stream turned into something akin to sharp assassin needles.</span></p><p><span style="">It was hard to maintain a sane mind when watching several hundred thousand sharp needles flying through the air.</span></p><p><span style="">Elf Lord Latasha was hanging in the air. &#xA0;She felt dizzy when she saw that attack coming towards her.</span></p><p><span style="">Her body was stiff as a board, and she was so surprised that she forgot to breathe. &#xA0;It felt as if several dozen water drops containing the sharp energy would pierce through her.</span></p><p><span style="">No, it was going to happen.</span></p><p><span style="">Pah-pah-pah-pah-pah-paht!</span></p><p><span style="">Latasha let out her breath as she saw the water droplets disperse as it impacted on an invisible barrier.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Hoo-ah.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Too-doo-doo-doo-dook.</span></p><p><span style="">It felt as if she was watching a heavy rainfall from below the eaves. &#xA0;The water came flying at incredible speed, yet it dispersed into the surrounding after impacting against the barrier. &#xA0;One couldn&apos;t just laugh it off when one thought about the power behind attack.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;They aren&apos;t that big of a deal.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Latasha reflexively turned her head. &#xA0;She looked at the man flying in the air as he held onto the collar of her shirt.</span></p><p><span style="">Immortal.</span></p><p><span style="">She had never seen or hear of someone that was as unreasonable as him.</span></p><p><span style="">He was trying to brute force himself into the Litan City, which was protected by the Water Dragons.... &#xA0;It was something even the Dimensional lord of Trahnet avoided doing.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;The Breaths aren&apos;t the end of it!&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Even if the Soul Barrier allowed him to avoid any damage, there were dozens of additional reason why Water Dragons of the Litan Lake were dangerous.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;What? &#xA0;It isn&apos;t as if the Water Dragons can fly. &#xA0;Can they?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;They can.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;...what?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin was dumbfound as he looked at Latasha.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;They can fly?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;W...we have to take shelter...</span></p><p><span style="">Poo-ah-ah-ah!</span></p><p><span style="">The whirlpool split apart as the heads of the Dragons surfaced.</span></p><p><span style="">Koo-ah-ah-ah!</span></p><p><span style="">Accompanying the roars, the Dragons appeared. &#xA0;They were so long that their tails were still within the water even though the Dragons had almost reached Woojin.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Oohk!&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin quickly shifted his body, and he avoided the sharp teeth of a Dragon. &#xA0;The Dragons had long whiskers as long as its body, and it was reminiscent of a catfish. &#xA0;Moreover, it was closer to looking like an Eastern Dragon from legend then a Western Dragon.</span></p><p><span style="">There were 17 of them, and they rose into the sky as if they were swimming through sky. &#xA0;When they earnestly started to attack Woojin, he couldn&apos;t defend against it for too long.</span></p><p><span style="">&apos;My souls will dissipate first.&apos;</span></p><p><span style="">If the Soul Armor had enough souls in storage, it formed a barrier to automatically protect Woojin. &#xA0;The continuous threats were quickly dissipating his Souls.</span></p><p><span style="">He had diligently gathered souls after he arrived at Alphen, yet he might regrettably lose all he had gained.</span></p><p><span style="">This was the first time Woojin felt taken aback.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Shit!&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">They quickly changed direction, and they escaped from the skies above Litan Lake.</span></p><p><span style="">They landed on the ground as if skipping across the ground. &#xA0;The 17 Dragons, which had been swimming in the air, glared at Woojin, then they returned below the surface of the water.</span></p><p><span style="">Chah-ah-ahk!</span></p><p><span style="">The lake waters became waves as it wetted the land.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Kook. &#xA0;What the hell?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin got up, and he looked at the sloshing lake.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Kuhk. &#xA0;What did I tell you?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Latasha had rolled alongside Woojin, so she scolded him.</span></p><p><span style="">He had pompously stepped forward, yet he had come up with empty results.</span></p><p><span style="">Latasha was about to say something more, but she shut up when the furrows on his forehead deepened. &#xA0;There was nothing good about unnecessarily getting on his nerves.</span></p><p><span style="">Anyways, the Water Dragons were a disaster level power.</span></p><p><span style="">It was so bad that Trahnet&apos;s Dimensional lord left this place alone.</span></p><p><span style="">Just because he was the Immortal didn&apos;t mean he&apos;ll do any better. &#xA0;Latasha made this accusation inside her head as she check up on the Immortal&apos;s expression.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;...?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Laughter? Was he really laughing right now?</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;This is fun.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">After he laughed for a brief moment, he took out his Warrior&apos;s Weapon.</span></p><p><span style="">Was he trying to attempt it again? &#xA0;Was he going to go against the Water Dragons of the Litan&#x2019;s Lake?</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Y...you are being reckless!&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;We won&apos;t know what will happen unless I try it out.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">In the past, the first Dragon he had caught was hard, but it got easier as he hunted several more of them.</span></p><p><span style="">It would be a bit troublesome fighting 17 of them, but it wasn&apos;t as if it was impossible.</span></p><p><span style="">He wasn&apos;t alone either.</span></p><p><span style="">Shoo-shoo-shoohk.</span></p><p><span style="">Black smoke coalesced around Woojin to form Death Knights.</span></p><p><span style="">[Are we hunting Dragons?]</span></p><p><span style="">[It has been awhile since we&apos;ve seen Dragons.]</span></p><p><span style="">[I think this is the Litan&apos;s Lake....]</span></p><p><span style="">All the Death Knights were Woojin&apos;s familiars, but they were all from different races. &#xA0;Moreover, they all had distinct personalities. &#xA0;Their memories all varied, so several of them knew about the Water Dragons residing in Litan&apos;s Lake.</span></p><p><span style="">It didn&apos;t matter what they remembered. &#xA0;If Woojin ordered it, they wouldn&apos;t hesitate to charge forward.</span></p><p><span style="">[Goo-ha-ha. &#xA0;Are you trying to make friends for Yong Yong?]</span></p><p><span style="">Lich Jaenis was summoned besides Woojin. &#xA0;It would be possible to hunt all of the Water Dragons at the same time if Jaenis was by his side.</span></p><p><span style="">It would be possible with the help of a Lich, who was unrivalled at Debuff magic.</span></p><p><span style="">Weeeeeeng.</span></p><p><span style="">Moreover, they would be unrivalled if Dolsae joined the party.</span></p><p><span style="">It would be best if Yong Yong was with him, but he had enough power to hunt down the Dragons.</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin was about to confidently step forward towards the lake.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Let&apos;s do this ag....&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin was about to speak gallantly when he swallowed his words.</span></p><p><span style="">Shahhhh.</span></p><p><span style="">A boat was swiftly moving through the water towards Woojin.</span></p><p><span style="">In front of the boat, a 10 year old boy was steering the boat. &#xA0;He was wearing clothes that were way too big for him. &#xA0;Woojin tilted his head in confusion when he realized the clothes looked familiar.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;What the hell?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">The boat docked, and the boy placed a ladder over the railing. &#xA0;When he got off the boat, he approached Woojin.</span></p><p><span style="">There were Death Knights lined up all around him, yet the boy didn&apos;t back down at all.</span></p><p><span style="">The boy stood in front of Woojin, and he gave his greeting.</span></p><p><span style="">A cowl was precariously hanging on top of his head, but it refused to fall off.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Are you the Immortal?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin&apos;s eyes twinkled when the clear voice came out of the boy&apos;s lips.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Are you Lecia&apos;s high priest?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Yes, I am.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I hadn&apos;t called you, so why did you come out here?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I didn&apos;t invite you, so why did you come here?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;.....&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin didn&apos;t say anything. &#xA0;He silently stared at the boy.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;If the sacrifice of myself could protect the Litan&apos;s Island, it is worth it.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Why do you think I&apos;m here to kill you&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Aren&#x2019;t you here for the Lecia&apos;s Gloves?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">The boy pushed Lecia&apos;s Gloves towards Woojin.</span></p><p><span style="">It was a Holy Item that could grow a bud from all seeds, and it guaranteed the harvest of fruits.</span></p><p><span style="">This was Lecia&apos;s treasure. &#xA0;He was the god of fertility.</span></p><p><span style="">Of course, a high priest&apos;s authority was diminished when one lost the Holy Item. &#xA0;In certain circumstances, it was a worse offense to lose the Item than to die.</span></p><p><span style="">He was voluntarily giving away such a treasure....</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;...&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Was he a plucky little guy? &#xA0;Or was he being sensible?</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I&apos;ll use it well.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin unhesitatingly took the gloves.</span></p><p><span style="">It was the Ingredient Item needed to make Thrash&apos;s Punishment. &#xA0;The Holy Items were basically tokens of the high priests. &#xA0;However, as Lecia&apos;s high priest, he didn&apos;t look bothered at losing the Item.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I pray that the oracle comes to pass.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;The oracle...&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin let out a bitter laugh.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;What did Lecia say?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">The boy let out a faint laugh at the question.</span></p><p><span style="">The Immortal was a being that had faced the gods. &#xA0;He wasn&apos;t an insignificant being to the priests, who worshipped those gods. &#xA0;He had received an oracle yesterday night.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I was told to give you the treasure. &#xA0;She told me my wishes will come true if I do....&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;....&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin blankly stared down at the gloves.</span></p><p><span style="">He had gathered three Items that were crucial in making Thrash&apos;s Protection, March, and Punishment.</span></p><p><span style="">He only had two left.</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin unsummoned his familiars, and he left behind the Litan&apos;s Lake.</span></p><p><span style="">***</span></p><p><span style="">New Colony on the Saurus Mountain.</span></p><p><span style="">People were gathered in groups of twos and three around the World Tree. &#xA0;They were building houses, and the two flags were planted in the middle of everything.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;So that&apos;s what you were talking about?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;That&apos;s right.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">The people kept talking about the identity of the flag besides the Coalition&apos;s flag.</span></p><p><span style="">It was a roaring baby lion. &#xA0;No, it kind of looked like a cute tiger.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I can&apos;t believe that is the Immortal&apos;s symbol. &#xA0;What does it mean?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Isn&apos;t it roaring towards the world?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I think it is just yawning....&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">The common thread amongst these discussions were the Immortal&apos;s symbol. &#xA0;They were guessing the meaning behind it. &#xA0;The cute image didn&apos;t match up with the Immortal, and this incongruity fostered their curiosity.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I&apos;m sure it is a lion.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;What are you saying! &#xA0;It&apos;s obviously a tiger.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">This was a topic that kept flaring up between the people. &#xA0;The one that was the most curious was the young king of the Honshoo kingdom named Kontz.</span></p><p><span style="">He had heard about the Immortal through oral history, and this was the first time he had seen the Immortal. &#xA0;It was the first time he had seen the Undead army fight.</span></p><p><span style="">The Immortal was much different from the stories his father had told him.</span></p><p><span style="">The Immortal&apos;s existence was sufficient enough to draw the curiosity and admiration out of the young ruler Kontz.</span></p><p><span style="">There were several dozen lookouts around the Sauraus mountain hastily made out of wooden logs. &#xA0;Both the flags of Alandal and Coalition were hung out on these outposts.</span></p><p><span style="">Kontz had climbed up one of these lookouts, and he let out a bright laugh when he saw a fireball coming towards them.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Sunggoo-nim is back.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">The heroes that had accompanied the Immortal was no joke. &#xA0;There was a Vampire Lord and a Fire Spirit.</span></p><p><span style="">Weren&apos;t they worthy of being companions of the Immortal?</span></p><p><span style="">Sunggoo was very good at drinking alcohol. &#xA0;His shoulder dance made everyone want to dance, and he was great at leading a party. &#xA0;Kontz had never heard of a Fire Spirit that was great at drinking alcohol.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Sunggoo-nim is back.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Kontz had become fairly close with him as they shared alcohol. &#xA0;Kontz quickly came down from the look out, and he vigorously shook his arms in greeting. &#xA0;The arc of fire in the air located Kontz, and the fire landed right in front of him.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Kontz.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Thank you for your hard work.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Heh heh. &#xA0;I have to practice a little bit more before I head back to training.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;As expected.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">He was so strong, yet he still thinking about training....</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;There is something I always wanted to ask you.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;What is it? &#xA0;Anyways, hasn&apos;t it been a day since the Colony was built? &#xA0;Shouldn&apos;t it be done by now?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Mmm? I think it should be done soon.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Kontz looked up at the sun in the sky, and it looked to be in the same spot as yesterday. &#xA0;He nodded his head.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Let us talk as we walk.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Yes.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;What do you want to ask me?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;The people are very curious about Alandal&apos;s symbol. &#xA0;Is it a lion or a tiger?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Huh?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Sunggoo tilted his head in confusion as he looked at the flag. &#xA0;The first person that came to mind was Bibi when he saw it....</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;It is probably a cat.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;What?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;You don&apos;t know what a cat is?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I do, but...&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I&apos;m sure.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;....&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I think?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Kontz looked disappointed by Sunggoo&apos;s answer. &#xA0;It looked as if his high expectation was stabbed in the back. &#xA0;Sunggoo shrugged his shoulders as he looked at Kontz&apos;s sulking face.</span></p><p><span style="">He knew the flag was hung around Alandal, but he had never asked about how it came to be. &#xA0;This was why Sunggoo didn&apos;t know the story behind it. &#xA0;The only thing he knew was that the picture made him think about Bibi. &#xA0;That was what what came to his mind first.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Haha. &#xA0;I&apos;m pretty sure the Holy Maiden knows the story behind it.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Of course! I&apos;ll have to quickly go see Melody-nim.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">In any case, all the heroes of the Coalition was climbing up the Saurus mountain to watch the completion of the Colony.</span></p><p><span style="">They had superior physical ability compared to the civilians, so they would be able to climb the mountain in a short amount of time.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Huh?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Jaemin had gotten there before Sunggoo. &#xA0;He approached Jaemin, who had a sour expression on his face.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Jaemin! &#xA0;Is something wrong?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Hyung.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Uh. &#xA0;What&apos;s up?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Did you hear about the oracle?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;....?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Sunggoo didn&apos;t know what Jaemin was talking about, so he tilted his head in confusion. &#xA0;Jaemin discreetly pointed towards Melody, who was kneeling in front of the World Tree.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I heard the goddess Aria gave an oracle before Woojin-hyung came back to Alphen.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;What about it?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Didn&apos;t anyone, who went to school, know that gods and goddesses gave oracles? &#xA0;Wasn&apos;t it a given?</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Goddess Aria is the goddess of prophecy.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Huh?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Was he talking about a prophecy?</span></p><p><span style="">Sunggoo&apos;s expression also got serious, and Sunggoo asked a question.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;What did she say?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;That is...&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Jaemin opened his mouth with a dark expression.</span></p>
