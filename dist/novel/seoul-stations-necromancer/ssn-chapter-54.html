His face automatically wore a nervous expression.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hey, Soolgi. Hello?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yeah. Hello, Jaemin.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Soolgi laughed gaily when Jaemin awkwardly waved his hand. When Jaemin walked past her, it felt as if a heavy boulder fell on top of his heart.</span></p><p><span style="">No. It felt as if his heart was in a free-fall.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Ah, Dojaemin. You idiot.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">Even if he kicked himself, it was already too late. After that day, he felt an indescribable sense of distance from her. She was much prettier than before. She laughed more frequently, but he felt something was missing.</span></p><p><span style="">He was so out of it that he wasn&#x2019;t able to focus on his studies, and he feebly passed the time.</span></p><p><span style="">Before Jaemin&#x2019;s tutoring school class started, he opened his hand phone. As a habit, he opened his internet browser, then he shook his head when he read the posted articles .</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I would have never guess this hyung was such an amazing person.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">He had looked like a homeless bum, but now it felt like he was some rich heir.</span></p><p><span style="">[An Unprecedented Event. Two Person Party clearing 6 star Dungeon.]</span></p><p><span style="">[Hwarang Guild&#x2019;s Vice President Lee-yunhwee&#x2019;s Mysterious Death.]</span></p><p><span style="">[Kahng-woojin A?, AA?]</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Uh? There was an accident?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Jaemin searched for more articles, and it seemed the internet was in an uproar since the dawn of yesterday. Before the Break could happen, Woojin and Lee-yunhwee entered the Dungeon, and they had cleared it. Moreover, Lee-yunhwee had died in the process.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hul.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">It was big news that the two of them cleared the 6 star Dungeon to stop the Break, but the more shocking news was the death of the famous Roused Lee-yunhwee.</span></p><p><span style="">[Kahng-woojin&#x2019;s Woman? Interest.]</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;W&#x2026;what?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Jaemin was surprised when he clicked open the article.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What? He had a girlfriend?? Ooh wah. She is so pretty.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The photo of Kahng-woojin kissing a woman was posted. His face had been injured during the Dungeon raid.</span></p><p><span style="">The number 1 real time searched topic was Kahng-woojin&#x2019;s girlfriend.</span></p><p><span style="">As he looked through numerous pictures, Jaemin couldn&#x2019;t help but shake his head.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ooh-wah. She&#x2019;s really pretty.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">She looked very familiar, but amongst all the women he had seen before, she was the most beautiful woman he had seen. In the picture, her eyes were filled with tears, and it reinforced his opinion of her.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ok ok. Let&#x2019;s start the lesson.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">When the teacher of the tutoring class showed up, Jaemin put his hand phone away, then he focused on the lecture.</span></p><p><span style="">When his lecture ended, Jaemin happily answered the incoming phone call.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Uh, noonah.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">[Are you heading home?]</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yeah.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">[I&#x2019;m also heading towards home&#x2026;]</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Uh?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">[Noonah quit her work.]</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Uh uh?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">[I&#x2019;ll talk to you when I get there. I&#x2019;m almost there, so wait for me at home.]</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Uh uh uh?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Ddoo-ooh, ddoo.</span></p><p><span style="">When his noonah ended the call after saying what she had to say, Jaemin had a confused look on his face. Jaemin arrived at home. He threw his backpack down, then he laid down on his bed.</span></p><p><span style="">He had a hard time studying on days like today. He could only think about Soolgi.</span></p><p><span style="">For a long time, he stared blankly at nothing. Then Jaemin heard the door click open.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Noonah is here? Why did you suddenly quit your job&#x2026;.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Jaemin froze as he was getting up when he saw his noonah. Jiwon laughed at Jaemin&#x2019;s reaction.</span></p><p><span style="">Even she had been shocked, so how much more surprised would Jaemin be?</span></p><p><span style="">Jaemin&#x2019;s two eyes blinked.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Who, who&#x2026;.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Who do you think it is? It&#x2019;s me.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Jaemin remembered seeing the woman in front of him. When that thought suddenly came to him, he was surprised.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;W&#x2026;Woojin hyung&#x2019;s girlfriend?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Do you want me to hit you? Don&#x2019;t you know your noonah&#x2019;s face?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Huh-ook. N&#x2026;noonah?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Jaemin was surprised. After the accident, she had almost always covered up her face&#x2026; Come to think of it, it was his noonah.</span></p><p><span style="">She looked the same as her previous beautiful self.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;N&#x2026;noonah. Noonahhh.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hoo-ook. Jaemin.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The siblings hugged each other, and they cried for awhile. Suddenly, Jaemin wiped his tears, then he looked at his noonah.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Where is Woojin hyung?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;He&#x2019;s still at Daegoo.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Did hyung make you all better?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Jiwon nodded her head.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hoo-hook. He asked to date you in exchange?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Huh? That is&#x2026;&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ooh-uh-uhng.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">He was deeply moved by the fact that his noonah&#x2019;s face had turned back to normal, but he couldn&#x2019;t help feel something had been stolen from him. This caused Jaemin to cry for awhile. (TLN: ( ?&#xB0; ?? ?&#xB0;) siscon)</span></p><p><span style="">*</span></p><p><span style="">Daegoo Jookjun Station&#x2019;s neighboring hotel.</span></p><p><span style="">Woo-soonghoon immediately drove Jiwon back to Seoul. Jung-minchan had to negotiate how the ownership equities of the Dungeon will be divided between the army and the Hwarang guild. He had to delay his return to Seoul.</span></p><p><span style="">The negotiation dragged on, so Woojin took a long break inside the hotel.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ah. Why is my ears burning?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Maybe someone is talking behind hyung-nim&#x2019;s back?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin grinned at Sunggoo&#x2019;s words.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;My ears wouldn&#x2019;t wouldn&#x2019;t hurt just from a mere insult being spoken behind my back.. Maybe someone is casting a curse on me.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;&#x2026;.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Let&#x2019;s go run the Dungeon again.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Right now? The negotiations hasn&#x2019;t been finalized yet&#x2026;&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Can&#x2019;t we just give them some bloodstones after we clear the Dungeon?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">He didn&#x2019;t really care about the ownership equities. He didn&#x2019;t need to excavate for minor things like the bloodstones. However, he had to maximize his supply of Achievement Points and EXP.</span></p><p><span style="">His leveling was slowing down, but he was well on his way to becoming level 60 soon. His familiars leveling up was as important as Woojin leveling up.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Still, the process is much faster than Alphen&#x2026;.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">It wouldn&#x2019;t take long as when he was on Alphen. However, he had a hard time relaxing, since he didn&#x2019;t know when Trahnet&#x2019;s large-scale invasion will happen.</span></p><p><span style="">The monsters hadn&#x2019;t run wild on Alphen unlike the ones in the Dungeons. Eventually the Dungeons will erupt&#x2026;</span></p><p><span style="">The real confusion will start from that moment on.</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin wasn&#x2019;t in a hurry, but he wasn&#x2019;t relaxed either. He was silently getting ready.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I&#x2019;ll have to go out and talk to Haemin. Get ready, so we can go to the Dungeon. I&#x2019;ll just tell Director Jung to negotiate an adequate distribution of ownership. I&#x2019;m willing to share the money.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">He would share the money, but he won&#x2019;t share his EXP.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes, sir.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin stepped outside, and Sunggooo got ready to reattempt the Dungeon. Woojin used his now overflowing points to buy the bags that would increase his inventory. Then he used the stored Reinforcement Stones to increase his Stat Points.</span></p><p><span style="">Soon, Haemin came looking for Woojin.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;President. It seems you will have to go there yourself.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I thought I left everything in Minchan&#x2019;s hands.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">He didn&#x2019;t want to go through a boring negotiation with those dirty bastards. This was why he employed Minchan and Haemin. They would take care of the annoying works.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ah. The negotiations are almost finished. The Ministry of National Defense wants a 20% share, Hwarang wants 30%, and our portion is 50%.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;The army is taking an awfully large portion.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Well, just think of it as the price for being exempted form the military service.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Anyways, they had participated in this operation at the request of the Ministry of National Defense.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Also, the Hwarang guild also wants to participate in excavating the Artifacts. It seems they want to form a joint-party with Alandal. Since president wants to solo the Dungeon, Director Jung is renegotiating the terms. Roughly speaking, every time we use the Dungeon twice then the Hwarang guild will use it once.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hmmm.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin spoke as he stroked his chin.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I want you to change it to time instead of attempts. We will use it for 2 days, then those bastards could use it for 1 day.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The 6 star Dungeon had been cleared, and the information had just been released. In terms of real time, it would take around 12 hours to clear it. Two days time would flow within the Dungeon.</span></p><p><span style="">Alandal will be able to clear it 4 times and Hwarang will clear it twice.</span></p><p><span style="">In any case, it will be a 2:1 ratio, so he&#x2019;ll earn EXP like crazy in the allotted time.</span></p><p><span style="">If Woojin picked up his speed, he would be able to complete more than 4 runs in two days. He could probably double the run.</span></p><p><span style="">He didn&#x2019;t know when he&#x2019;ll be able to take over a 6 star Dungeon again, so he decided to power level here.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Go tell Minchan to negotiate for those terms.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes. Understood. However, this isn&#x2019;t about the negotiations. You have to go to a press conference.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin&#x2019;s eyebrows twitched.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Press conference?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">*</span></p><p><span style="">There were several dozen cameras, and even more reporters present. Woojin entered into the hotel hall filled with people. Jung-minchan was already sitting with a dark expression on his face. Hwarang&#x2019;s representative Lee-sahngho and several other people were also in their seats.</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin sat next to Jung-minchan.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I&#x2019;m sorry. I couldn&#x2019;t stop the interview. If anyone asks difficult questions, then please don&#x2019;t answer it.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin barely paid attention to Minchan&#x2019;s words as he looked around his surrounding. He saw Lee-sahngho flash him a smile, and he pretty much knew Lee-sahngho was planning something.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;So does this mean he is probably up to something?&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin sat still as he observed.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Did the Hwarang and Alandal discuss beforehand about clearing the Dungeon? Did you discuss it before the Break happened? Did you make any agreements for this unreasonable Dungeon raid? Did president Lee-sahngho give any other directions?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I didn&#x2019;t give her any other orders. Vice president Lee-yunhwee was entrusted to be in charge of the site. I told her to assist Mr. Kahng-woojin, who was in the spotlight these days, to the best of her ability.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">As if it had been rehearsed, Lee-sahngho quickly gave an answer to the reporter&#x2019;s question.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Then is it safe to assume that Vice President Lee-yunhwee entered the Dungeon to save Alandal&#x2019;s president Kahng-woojin? Is it highly probable?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Mmmm. About that&#x2026; I still can&#x2019;t believe my dongsaeng wasn&#x2019;t able to make it back&#x2026;&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Lee-sahngho put on a tortured expression then he covered his face with his hands. Every reporter&#x2019;s gaze headed towards Kahng-woojin when they saw this.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;This question is for Mr. Kahng-woojin. Did you consult with Ms. Lee-yunhwee before you decided to enter the Dungeon?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;&#x2026;.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">When Woojin sat there without saying anything, the reporters kept asking more questions.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;During the Dungeon raid, how was your teamwork with Ms. Lee-yunhwee??&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Please give us a detailed account on how she died.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;How did she die? Was Immortal the final monster? Did Mr. Kahng-woojin make every effort to save her?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;&#x2026;.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin kept silent as they continuously asked him questions.</span></p><p><span style="">The one who answered was Jung-minchan.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;You all are asking too much questions. It has only been several hours since our president finished clearing the Dungeon.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">At Jung-minchan&#x2019;s answer, one reporter immediately gave a rebuttal.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I just found this out a moment ago. Didn&#x2019;t he request to go in to the Dungeon again?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;That&#x2019;s right. If he is well enough to get ready to attempt the Dungeon again, then it seems he wasn&#x2019;t too traumatized by this event.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Is he trying to avoid answering questions? Maybe there was some friction with Ms. Lee-yunhwee inside the Dungeon?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Lee-sahngho grinned behind the hands covering his face.</span></p><p><span style="">Yes. Keep pushing him. The Roused are public figures.</span></p><p><span style="">Kahng-woojin wasn&#x2019;t a Rank A. He might be a Rank AA, and this fact was being spread across Korea, and it was also starting to become known to the world.</span></p><p><span style="">Everything will be leaked to the media, so they will take notice of every single move made by him. The whole world will be focused on him, and Lee-sahngho wanted Kahng-woojin to live a weary life. He probably can&#x2019;t even imagine how hard it was to live with that much attention on him.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;I bet this bastard never received this level of scrutiny.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">He wanted Woojin&#x2019;s temper to be the gateway to his downfall.</span></p><p><span style="">Since the whole world would be interested in Wooijn, the media will tear Woojin apart at the slightest mistake he made. It will lead to his downfall. This wasn&#x2019;t about his Roused ability. His mental fortitude was an entirely different problem.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Mr. Kahng-woojin. The people of this nation has the right to know. Please end your silence and answer the questions.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;&#x2026;.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">At Woojin&#x2019;s silence, Jung-minchan&#x2019;s face hardened. The atmosphere was being steered towards a weird place as if they were in some hearing.</span></p><p><span style="">If he had known the press conference would turn out like this, he would have done everything to prevent it. Lee-sahngho had gained the upper hand in the negotiations, and he had to concede to the request of having a press conference. He had guessed Lee-sahngho was angry from losing his dongsaeng, but&#x2026;</span></p><p><span style="">Of course, his president wasn&#x2019;t at fault, but would the person who haf lost a family member feel the same way? He would probably assign blame to anyone he could see. He probably wanted to vent his anger.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;He is pointlessly blaming our president&#x2026;&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">Even though Jung-minchan understood Lee-sahngho&#x2019;s sadness, he still felt it was a little bit unfair. The press conference was being broadcast live, so he couldn&#x2019;t question Lee-sahngho now.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Mr. Kahng-woojin. Please answer&#x2026;&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">At the reporter&#x2019;s clamoring, Woojin raised his hand as if to say stop. Woojin leaned back in his seat, then he arrogantly looked around at the reporters.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What do you guy want from me?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;The public has the right to know. We are&#x2026;.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Stop talking nonsense.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;&#x2026;.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin stood up from his seat.</span></p><p><span style="">He walked past Jung-minchan, then he headed towards Lee-sahngho. Lee-sahngho looked up with his grief-stricken face still on his face. Kahng-woojin proceeded to kick Lee-sahngho&#x2019;s shoulder.</span></p><p><span style="">Kwah-dahng.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Huh?&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">Lee-sahngho fell over in his chair. He was too dumbfounded at what had just happened.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What are you doing?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Bull shit.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin grinned. When Lee-sahngho tried to get up, Woojin kicked him again on the chest.</span></p><p><span style="">Kwah-da-tahng.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Huh. Are you crazy? This is a live broadcast.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;So what?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">When Lee-sahngho stood up, Woojin grabbed him around the back of his neck. Woojin brought Lee-sahngho close to look him in the eyes. Kahng-woojin&#x2019;s indifferent eyes seemed to see through him. Lee-sahngho&#x2019;s eyes automatically looked down.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;If you want to spread bull shit, then you do it yourself. Don&#x2019;t be a little bitch working from behind.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hoo hoo. You are making a mistake. This is being broadcasted live to the entire country.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Lee-sahngho laughed even though the back of his neck was being held. He knew this guy wouldn&#x2019;t be able to overcome his temper, but he never expected it to happen this fast.</span></p><p><span style="">This is the end.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;So what?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">A live broadcast to the entire country? Did 50 million people make up the population of Korea?</span></p><p><span style="">What was the population of Alphen&#x2026; One billion? Two billion? He had killed so much that he wasn&#x2019;t sure what the exact number was. The entire planet basically watched his every move. No. Even if 6 billion eyes of whole world followed him around, did he think Woojin&#x2019;s actions would change?</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Do you like being hit on live broadcast?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Kahng-woojin&#x2019;s hand slapped Lee-sahngho&#x2019;s cheek.</span></p><p><span style="">Zzuh-uhk.</span></p><p><span style="">The surprised cameraman continued to film with a dumbfounded expression on his face. The reporters lost the words they were about to speak, then they just swallowed their saliva.</span></p><p></p></div><p></p>
