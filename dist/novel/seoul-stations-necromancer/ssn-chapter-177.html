<p><span style="">Chapter 177 - Defense (1) </span></p><p><span style="">Shoo-shoong!</span></p><p><span style="">When Woojin and Melody entered the building, the door closed. &#xA0;They were completely sealed off from the outside air.</span></p><p><span style="">Zeeeeng.</span></p><p><span style="">There was a ringing in his ears, and he felt a headache alongside it. &#xA0;Woojin frowned as he massaged his temple.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;What the hell?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">He felt some unidentifiable sense of danger, and he instinctively became wary of his surrounding. &#xA0;He looked around, but nothing had changed.</span></p><p><span style="">There was a clean corridor, and there was hole with a ladder leading down. &#xA0;It was something one would see in a typical spaceship.</span></p><p><span style="">It wasn&apos;t something outwardly that had changed. &#xA0;It was something within.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;....&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">He couldn&apos;t feel any magical energy.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Ramson.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;....&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin called for him, but he couldn&apos;t even feel the presence of his Familiar Ramson.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Dolsae! &#xA0;Jaenis!&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;....&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">His voice didn&apos;t reach his familiars. &#xA0;His voice just echoed back to him in this space.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;You won&apos;t be able to hear anything except the goddess Aria&apos;s voice.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;...&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">When Woojin turned around to look, he could see a soft energy surrounding Melody&apos;s body. He knew Melody was filled with magical energy, since it was manifesting itself as the light around Melody.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Interesting.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Was this Aria&apos;s absolute space?</span></p><p><span style="">This was Woojin&apos;s first time visiting a goddess&apos; temple, so he didn&apos;t have much knowledge regarding the temple.</span></p><p><span style="">He could only make guesses.</span></p><p><span style="">Whether it was earth or Alphen, he&apos;d never been this far away from his Familiars.</span></p><p><span style="">&apos;I guess there was that one time.&apos;</span></p><p><span style="">It was when his level was initialized.</span></p><p><span style="">When he didn&apos;t have the prerequisites fulfilled, all his Familiars had been sealed.</span></p><p><span style="">This was still true for Yong Yong. &#xA0;He couldn&apos;t meet it until he reached level 90.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;You do what you came here to do.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Then you will be...?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I&apos;ll do what I came here to do.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;...&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">What business did the Immortal have at Aria&apos;s temple?</span></p><p><span style="">Melody stood still with a worried light in her eyes. &#xA0;Woojin pointed towards the entrance heading below with his chin.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Go.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I&apos;ll see you in a little bit.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Melody followed the dearth of energy coming from Aria. &#xA0;It was as if she was being called through the energy. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">When she was gone, Woojin looked around the inner structure of the temple.</span></p><p><span style="">From the outside, the building looked angular, but the space inside wasn&apos;t that large.</span></p><p><span style="">In the end, it seemed he had to descend through hole in the middle of the room.</span></p><p><span style="">When he grabbed the ladder, he found the ladder to be cold as ice.</span></p><p><span style="">Tong, tong.</span></p><p><span style="">Every time he descended a rung it sounded as if a shoulder was being rammed into a wall. &#xA0;It registered to him as an oddity as the sound rang out.</span></p><p><span style="">Toohk.</span></p><p><span style="">After he descended for a long time, he came to an open stretch of land.</span></p><p><span style="">The round hole descended much deeper, and he could see the top of Melody&#x2019;s head as she descended further down the ladder.</span></p><p><span style="">It seemed her destination was much deeper.</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin decided to step onto the lower level, and he started touching the walls.</span></p><p><span style="">Chuhk. &#xA0;Too-toohng.</span></p><p><span style="">His hands didn&apos;t come across any switches, yet the lights turned on in the room. &#xA0;His hand was raised in the air with nowhere to go, so he clenched his fist as he looked around.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;It&apos;s huge.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">There was a hole in the roof and the floor. &#xA0;The frame of a skinny ladder extended through the hole.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Is it really a spaceship?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">He possessed a Dimensional Domain, and he had seen strange creatures and marvelous items from various Dimensions. &#xA0;Somehow he wasn&apos;t too surprised at finding a building he assumed to be a spaceship on Alphen.</span></p><p><span style="">There was no proof that something like this was on earth.</span></p><p><span style="">The only thing that tickled his curiosity was the fact that this was Aria&apos;s Temple.</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin looked around his surrounding, and he approached some unknown table. &#xA0;He stretched out his hand.</span></p><p><span style="">Weeeeeng.</span></p><p><span style="">A clear sound rang out, and a screen popped up on top of the table. &#xA0;Woojin grinned.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Interesting. &#xA0;This if fun.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Indecipherable symbols and letters were displayed on the touch screen.</span></p><p><span style="">It wasn&#x2019;t English or Korean. &#xA0;He couldn&apos;t read it, but it was a familiar interface.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;It&apos;s a computer..&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Amongst the feelings he had experienced for the past 20 years on Alphen, the feeling he felt right now was the most special one.</span></p><p><span style="">He didn&apos;t know if this had anything to do with earth or not, but why was he having this odd feeling?</span></p><p><span style="">Was this a connecting factor between earth and Alphen? &#xA0;Or was the earth&apos;s modern technology similar, because it was introduced by someone else in the past? &#xA0;Was it part of the ancient legacy of Alphen?</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin randomly pressed his fingers against the touch screen.</span></p><p><span style="">A sound alert kept ringing out as if in error, but he didn&apos;t stop moving his fingers.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Should I just break it?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">When he made up his mind to do so, the table projected a holographic figure made out of light.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;What? &#xA0;You were listening to me the whole time?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin looked straight at the woman, who he was acquainted with, with a baffled expression on his face.</span></p><p><span style="">[It has been a while.]</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;This is my second time meeting you.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin thought about the first time he met Aria.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Is this real? &#xA0;Is it a dream? &#xA0;Or is this just a hologram?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">[Is it really important to determine what is real?]</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Well, I don&apos;t know if it is important or not.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">It was important to determine if this unknown being&#x2019;s intentions were friendly, but he had more important things to worry about.</span></p><p><span style="">This was especially true for Woojin in this point in time.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;What are you?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">[I&apos;m the goddess of prophecy. &#xA0;They call me Aria.]</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Are you some kind of prediction program?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">[I have no idea.]</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;You are giving me a headache.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin pressed his temple with his fingers.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;All right. &#xA0;If I ask you questions, will you answer it? &#xA0;Or will you be like the last time? &#xA0;Are you going to speak in nonsensical doubletalk?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">It was like that in his first meeting with Aria.</span></p><p><span style="">He didn&#x2019;t know if he had been in a dream or a different dimension. &#xA0;He had spoken to her in a nebulous location, and he hadn&#x2019;t particularly liked the conversation.</span></p><p><span style="">At the time, he felt like an elementary student being called into the principal office. &#xA0;She gave him praise, and it had been an uncomfortable experience.</span></p><p><span style="">She pretty much said she had her eyes on him, and she gave him words of encouragement to work harder.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Does this mean you can&#x2019;t bring me to your location at your whim like before?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin grinned as he looked at what was surrounding the table projecting the hologram.</span></p><p><span style="">[.....]</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;It would be in your best interest to answer me. &#xA0;You should do it before I destroy everything here.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">[All right. &#xA0;However, you don&#x2019;t have much time left to ask your questions.]</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;What is the Code?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">[It is something everyone has. &#xA0;You have the Code to Earth. &#xA0;It is like an resident certificate for a planet. &#xA0;It is something like your nationality.]</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;...that&apos;s an unexpected answer.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">[....]</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin&#x2019;s face crumpled into a harsh visage.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;The Dimensional lords are making such a mess for something so insignificant?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">[They are trying to find the Master Code.]</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Master Code?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">[It isn&#x2019;t a Code that allows one to reside in a Dimension. &#xA0;It gives one the authority to rule.]</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;What a muddled mess. &#xA0;So they want to become a god?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">[...]</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin shook his head when he realized the meaning behind Aria&#x2019;s silence.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;How can you gain this Code?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">[You&#x2019;ve already guessed it.]</span></p><p><span style="">What had the Dimensional lords done up until now? &#xA0;They took control of Dungeons and built Colonies to search the entire planet. &#xA0;They destroyed and killed&#x2026;.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;So I have to kill the one that has the Code?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">[Correct.]</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;All right. &#xA0;Does a planet have only one Code?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">[It varies.]</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;How many does Alphen have?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">[We have five.]</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Is it Aria, Skia, Lecia, Heres and Coors?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">[...correct.]</span></p><p><span style="">Alphen had numerous gods and goddesses.</span></p><p><span style="">However, amongst them, only 5 Holy Items were needed to make the Thrash&#x2019;s Set. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Am I the only one, who is creeped out by this?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">[....]</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Thrash. &#xA0;Is he a Code?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">[Hidden Code. &#xA0;It is an authority that we agreed to seal.]</span></p><p><span style="">This was the riddle he couldn&#x2019;t solve for the longest time. &#xA0;Woojin hid his trembling heart as he asked the question.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Where do I find Executioner?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">[...you&#x2019;ll only be able to gather the Keys on Alphen. &#xA0;The true Hidden Code can be completed at a different location.]</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin&#x2019;s eyebrows twitched.</span></p><p><span style="">He had been summoned from earth to Alphen.</span></p><p><span style="">Thrash&#x2019;s Set was an Item specialized for a Necromancer. &#xA0;It was for him.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Are you saying it is on earth?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">[...]</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin&#x2019;s face crumpled. &#xA0;He looked at Aria with an angry expression.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Answer me!&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">[Correct.]</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;What can the Hidden Code do? &#xA0;Does it also allow one to become a ruler? &#xA0;Does it allow one to become &#xA0;a god?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">[...]</span></p><p><span style="">The figure in the hologram blinked.</span></p><p><span style="">[It is quite different from the right to rule. &#xA0;It is used to Delete.]</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;So it gives you the right to Delete.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">He had been searching for this. &#xA0;This was what Woojin wanted, and it was the function of the Thrash&#x2019;s Executioner. &#xA0;This was what Jaenis always insisted they had to find.</span></p><p><span style="">The riddle was solved.</span></p><p><span style="">The answer was on earth.</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin was about to turn away with a relieved expression on his face. &#xA0;However, the hologram&#x2019;s mouth moved as a ringing noise prevented him from walking away.</span></p><p><span style="">[You have a lot of competitors, and they are starting to take you seriously.]</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I&#x2019;ve always been the focus of their attention.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Even if all the Dimensional lords were against him, Woojin didn&#x2019;t care. &#xA0;Unlike his confidence, Aria&#x2019;s worry was large.</span></p><p><span style="">[There are a lot of beings trying to take away your gateway.]</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Are you talking about the Colony? &#xA0;I just have to use my Return Portal.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">[...you don&#x2019;t have Alphen&#x2019;s Code. &#xA0;You cannot use your Return Portal here.]</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;...&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Wasn&#x2019;t that a pretty big problem?</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Really?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">[Yes.]</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;....&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Now he could understand why Dimensional refugees and lords put a special significance to their home planet.</span></p><p><span style="">Residence Code.</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin was able to use the Return Portal without restriction on earth. &#xA0;It was, because he was from earth.</span></p><p><span style="">If he couldn&#x2019;t use his Portal, the only way he could get to his Domain was through the Dungeon or the Colony&#x2019;s gate.</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin thought about his struggle to return to earth for the past 20 years.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Does Melody need more time?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">[She&#x2019;ll be up soon.]</span></p><p><span style="">While Woojin was feeling restless, he suddenly had a question, so he asked it.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;The oracle&#x2026; &#xA0;Was it talking about my current predicament?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">[...yes. This is why you shouldn&#x2019;t have taken your time to get here.]</span></p><p><span style="">Didn&#x2019;t she say he would find the answer, but lose his way?</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Ha... &#xA0;Instead of that vague mumbo jumbo, couldn&#x2019;t you have spoken in blunt terms?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">[...]</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin was shaking his head from side to side when a disc suddenly appeared from the hole in the middle of the room. &#xA0;Melody was standing on it.</span></p><p><span style="">She wore a shiny circlet, and he was glad to see her. &#xA0;Woojin hurriedly moved towards her.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I&apos;ll see you next time.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">[I wish you good luck.]</span></p><p><span style="">The disc held Woojin and Melody. &#xA0;It ascended quickly like an elevator. &#xA0;Aria&#x2019;s hologram was left alone, but the hologram didn&#x2019;t disappear.</span></p><p><span style="">[...I wish you good luck.]</span></p><p><span style="">The entrance to his Dimensional Domain would not be the only place under attack. &#xA0;The gateway that would lead him back to earth was also in danger&#x2026;.</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin would need a lot of luck to save earth. &#xA0;On the other hand, Alphen&#x2019;s salvation was a certainty.</span></p><p><span style="">Alphen had gained a hero called the Immortal.</span></p><p><span style="">His rage would be directed towards the Dimensional lords with gates on Alphen.</span></p><p><span style="">***</span></p><p><span style="">Saurus&apos; Colony.</span></p><p><span style="">The atmosphere was beyond heavy. &#xA0;It took 10 days for the mood of the people to become ugly.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Their army is over 100,000 in number! &#xA0;We have to make a decision!&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Didn&apos;t we make the decision already? &#xA0;We have to protect the Colony and the World Tree.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Graham shook his head at Latasha&apos;s words.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;In reality, it is an impossible task. &#xA0;The difference in number is too stark. &#xA0;We won&apos;t be able to hold on by putting faith in the Fortress&apos; castle wall. &#xA0;On top it all, we can&apos;t even contact the Immortal.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;...if we do run away, what can we do?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;If we are alive, we can always come up with a different plan in the future.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;If the Immortal was here...&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">If one wanted to use the unique advantages of the Colony City, the owner had to be there to use his Points. &#xA0;This was the only way their forces would become replenished.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;...&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Latasha turned to look at the tall World Tree.</span></p><p><span style="">&apos;Mother...&apos;</span></p><p><span style="">Jaemin had been brooding in the corner when he suddenly stood up. &#xA0;He let out a shout.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Yes, hyung!&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">He was so excited that he had spoken out loud the message he was sending through his mind. &#xA0;Of course, everyone&#x2019;s gaze focused on Jaemin.</span></p><p><span style="">Jaemin&#x2019;s face was flushed red as he conversed mentally with Woojin. &#xA0;Afterwards, he relayed the message to everyone there.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I was able to contact him! &#xA0;He is on his way here.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Ah, jeez. &#xA0;Hyung-nim made us worry too much.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Ah...&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Sunggoo mumbled to himself. &#xA0;Latasha let out a sigh as she prayed. &#xA0;The Immortal was her father&#x2019;s &#xA0;killer, yet she was so happy that he would be returning. &#xA0;Fate was a fickle mistress.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;He said it&apos;ll take him one week even if he comes here at full speed....&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">He was so far away that it&#x2019;ll take him some time to arrive here. &#xA0;The people gathered here didn&#x2019;t know whether they should laugh or cry. &#xA0;Tauric stepped forward to take control of the situation.</span></p><p><span style="">It was still dire news, but they had hope now.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Let us protect the Colony for a week.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">They had to protect the Colony until Kahng-woojin&apos;s return. &#xA0;This was for the Coalition, and it was for the alliance with Alandal.</span></p>
