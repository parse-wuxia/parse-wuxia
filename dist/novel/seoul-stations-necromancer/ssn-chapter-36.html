<p><strong>Chapter 36 Establishing a Guild.</strong></p><div id="chapterContent" class="innerContent fr-view"><p><span style="">Chapter 36 &#x2013; Establishing a Guild</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p><p><span style="">(<span>TLN: Another Sponsored Chapter.

Thank you and enjoy~)</span></span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Should I make a new one? Or should I steal one?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;S&#x2026;steal one? You can&#x2019;t do that.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I guess I have to make one.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;&#x2026;.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;You should find out how to make one first.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Sunggoo was taken aback, so he didn&#x2019;t know how he should answer Woojin. A guild wasn&#x2019;t some kind of a club. It wasn&#x2019;t something that could be made just on a whim.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I probably won&#x2019;t be able to go outside since there are a lot of reporters out there.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Sunggoo.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes, hyung-nim.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;You can&#x2019;t hide from them for the rest of your life. It would be better for you to get used to ignoring the attention early on, so you can get along with your life.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What? I thought hyung-nim didn&#x2019;t want to receive any attention?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I did?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin had a confused expression on his face. What kind of a person was Woojin at Alphen? His every movement, and whims were of great concern to everyone in the continent.</span></p><p><span style="">It was natural for everyone to be interested in him. This was why he didn&#x2019;t feel the slightest of excitement or repulsion from receiving exposure from the media.</span></p><p><span style="">Should he live the life of an average middle class citizen?</span></p><p><span style="">Nonsense. Trahnet was digging an underground tunnel through the subway stations, and he was aiming to take over earth.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;So what if my face becomes famous? There are things you can prevent in this world, and there are things you shouldn&#x2019;t block.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Well, that is true.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Normally he seemed immature, but he always seems to come up with the right words for situations like like this. As hyung-nim said, they were already receiving a lot of publicity from the press.</span></p><p><span style="">The Hammer guild pressured the media, so the media hadn&#x2019;t released their information. Still, this caused public interest to almost explode.</span></p><p><span style="">The person was able to accidentally enter a 5 star Dungeon, but he was a monster who could solo the Dungeon. The Management Bureau admitted Woojin&#x2019;s Roused Rank was incorrect, and they said his Rank would be newly measured.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I&#x2019;ll go do some research.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Take care of everything before I have join the army.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;If I go to the army, aren&#x2019;t you the one who is lose out?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;Yes.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Anyways, a high ranked Roused like Woojin would most assuredly receive preferential treatment&#x2026;</span></p><p><span style="">Sunggoo was booting up his computer when Woojin&#x2019;s hand phone rang.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hello?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">[Yes, Mr. Wooijn. This is Kim-haemin.]</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ah. What can I do for you? Isn&#x2019;t it too early to drink soju?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">[Haha. We can do that next time. I have something to discuss with you face to face. I have to talk to you about who you are going to entrust with the management of the Seoul Station&#x2019;s 6th exit.]</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Mmmm.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin thought of a good idea when Haemin contacted him.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Let&#x2019;s talk in person. I have to talk to you about the guild, so why don&#x2019;t I also meet with team leader Jung?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">[What? The guild? Are you sure?]</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes. Where do you want to meet?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">[I&#x2026;I&#x2019;m on my way right now. I&#x2019;ll be there soon!]</span></p><p><span style="">Before the phone call could be severed, he heard the sounds of Haemin running around.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Huh. Why do they like me so much?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">*</span></p><p><span style="">*4th Support Team. Team Leader Room.*</span></p><p><span style="">Boom.</span></p><p><span style="">The door opened in a rough manner, and Jung-minchan&#x2019;s face automatically knotted into a frown.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Which bastard is being so rude&#x2026;.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Team leader! We did it. We did it.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Haemin ran in, and his face was dripping with happiness. It was as if Korea had won the World Cup.</span></p><p><span style="">His overwhelming attitude made Minchan drop the etiquette between a superior officer and his worker. Moreover, he also stopped using the deeply ingrained Korean cultural etiquette between a senior and a junior to start the conversation.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What&#x2026;what did you just say?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Mr. Woojin wants to meet us. Mr. Woojin want to meet us about guild business!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Minchan suddenly stood up from his seat. His butt tipped over his chair, but he didn&#x2019;t care.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;You got another one, team leader!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Haha, haha-haht!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">He had received a lot of stress recently, but could there be a more happier event? Jung-minchan quickly wore his jacket, then he spoke to Haemin.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Let&#x2019;s get ready to meet him immediately. I&#x2019;ll go make my report to the president.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes, sir. Haha.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Haemin started to run with elation. Minchan also couldn&#x2019;t hold back his joy as he headed toward the president&#x2019;s office. The female secretary pressed the intercom button when Minchan arrived.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;President. Fourth Support Team leader is here for a visit.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">[Aigo. Please bring him in.]</span></p><p><span style="">Minchan&#x2019;s ears picked up the small sound coming from the intercom, and it made him smile. Yes. Jung-minchan isn&#x2019;t dead yet!</span></p><p><span style="">Minchan confidently entered the president&#x2019;s office, and Hammer guild&#x2019;s president Park-sahngoh greeted him near the sofa.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Aigo, our Team leader Jung. What has happened?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;We were contacted by Mr. Kang-woojin.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Aigo! What a happy occasion.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Park-sahngoh grabbed Jung-minchan&#x2019;s hands.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Our team leader Jung-minchan endured a lot of hardship. Huh huh huh.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hmm hmm. I need to settle a matter regarding Mr. Kang-woojin.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Huh huh. Didn&#x2019;t I entrust my full authority to team leader Jung??&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;We previously talked about the vice presidency seat&#x2026;.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Aigo. If our team leader Jung wants to give it to him, then we have to give it him.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Park-sahngoh&#x2019;s enthusiastic and almost burdensome support made Jung-minchan throw couple of victory uppercut inside his heart.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Huh huh. Thank you for your efforts. Thanks to team leader Jung our Hammer guild would establish our foothold as the number 1 guild in Korea.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The three great Guilds of Korea.</span></p><p><span style="">None of the Hammer, Hwarang or KH possessed 3 Rank A Roused. If they were able to make Woojin their new guild member then the Hammer guild would rise up to an unrivaled position.</span></p><p><span style="">Jung-minchan looked like a treasure to Park-sahngoh.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;So I&#x2019;m going to go knowing I have your approval.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Park-sahngoh himself showed Jung-minchan out of the president&#x2019;s office.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Of course. Please have a safe journey. I&#x2019;ll be waiting for the good news.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I&#x2019;ll be sure to return with good news.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hahaha. Hey, secretary Kim. Prepare a guild-wide company dinner!!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes, president.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Even when Jung-minchan got on the elevator, Park-sahngoh still shook Minchan&#x2019;s hand with a smile on his face.</span></p><p><span style="">When the elevator door closed, Jung-minchan made a fist, and he let fly an uppercut.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Hoot. If it wasn&#x2019;t for him, they wouldn&#x2019;t have been able to find a Rank A like Park-jinwoo. It was all thanks to him.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Eh-hem.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Minchan felt his fallen confidence recover. Did healing feel like this? He had done it once again.</span></p><p><span style="">Jung-minchan wasn&#x2019;t dead yet. He was alive and kicking.</span></p><p><span style="">He gathered the contract, required documents, and his notebook.</span></p><p><span style="">When he arrived at the 1st floor, Haemin was already on standby inside his car. Haemin looked as happy as Minchan.</span></p><p><span style="">*</span></p><p><span style="">*Sahdahng station&#x2019;s cafe. Angel Angel&#x2019;s business room.*</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What? Did I hear you wrong?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Minchan was suspicious as to whether his ears were really working or not. He didn&#x2019;t even have the chance to take out the contract. Woojin repeated his words once again.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I want ahjushi to come to our guild.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;&#x2026;.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">What kind of situation was this? He couldn&#x2019;t&#x2019; grasp what Woojin was saying, because his reply was so unexpected.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;When you called, it wasn&#x2019;t about making a contract with the Hammer guild?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin grinned.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Why would I go there? I want Team leader Jung and Mr. Haemin to come to my guild.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;&#x2026;.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Jung-minchan was surprised. Kim-haemin was also surprised.</span></p><p><span style="">Jungminchan groaned.</span></p><p><span style="">He already had a guild. Woojin was already affiliated with a guild. This was why he refused the temptation of joining the Hammer guild.</span></p><p><span style="">Where was he from? Hwarang? KH? Or some other small guild?</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Whew. What&#x2019;s the name of Mr. Woojin&#x2019;s guild?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;It&#x2019;s the Alandal guild.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">What? Alandal? This is the first time he had heard of this name. If he didn&#x2019;t know about it then it must be a very small guild. Haemin was quick to pick up on the situation, so he searched for it. However, the guild didn&#x2019;t exist.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Excuse me. The guild named Alandal doesn&#x2019;t exist?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin nodded his head if Haemin&#x2019;s words were reasonable.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Of course.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin looked at Haemin and Minchan.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;You two have to come&#x2026;&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;and make it.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;&#x2026;.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Did someone spike his morning coffee with drugs? Why did he keep hearing bullshit? So he wants to make a new guild?</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;How much do you make currently, Mr. Haemin?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Your annual salary.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I make a little over 50 thousand dollars&#x2026;.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I&#x2019;ll give you a hundred thousand dollar.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;If that is too little, I&#x2019;ll give you an additional 50 thousand dollar.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;&#x2026;?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Haemin&#x2019;s eyes turned round, and Woojin turned to look at team leader Jung. Jung-minchan beat him to the punch.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I&#x2019;m not someone who will be moved by money. No. Moreover, isn&#x2019;t this a little bit too absurd?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What is?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;You are suddenly talking about making a guild. Moreover, you want us to change employment. I am a team leader of the Hammer guild.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Guild was where the Roused gathered, but it was also a company. It saw similar to a talent agency. Each Roused was in a contractual relationship with the Guild.</span></p><p><span style="">The normal people entered as employees to departments like the Support division. Jung-minchan was an old hand in the guild. He had joined the Hammer Guild late, but he had enough ability to climb up to the rank of Team leader.</span></p><p><span style="">So how could he change guild based solely on money? If he took the long term view of his future, it would leave a huge dent in his career.</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin grinned.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Guild Alandal. Why don&#x2019;t you become one of the founding members?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;&#x2026;!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Jung-minchan&#x2019;s eyes shook. The word, &#x2018;founding member&#x2019;, shook his heart.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I&#x2019;m trying to make a guild, but I know nothing. Why don&#x2019;t ahjushi come over and help a little bit?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;&#x2026;.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;If you don&#x2019;t, I&#x2019;ll just go to Pyongyang.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;&#x2026;?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">What did him changing his employment have to do with going to Pyongyang?</span></p><p><span style="">*</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;&#x2026;.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">As they headed back to the Hammer guild, Haemin and Minchan didn&#x2019;t speak inside the car. Angel Angel was next to an intersection near the Sahdahng station, so the Hammer guild was a walking distance away. Before they could blink their eyes, they had arrived in the parking lot, and the silence didn&#x2019;t last too long afterwards.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Team leader. I&#x2019;m going to jump ship.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hey, you.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;No. To put it bluntly, isn&#x2019;t it great what he is trying to do? Mr. Woojin might be a Rank A Roused. No, I am sure he is one. Who else could solo clear a 5 star dungeon? Do you know how big his guild will become? If I stay in the Hammer guild, then how far could I climb up?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Hammer guild had grown as large as it could get, and the guild would have a hard time expanding any further. His seniors, who had entered the guild before him, was firmly entrenched in the top seats. The prospect of him advancing in the guild was quite hopeless.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Doesn&#x2019;t Mr. Woojin already possess one 5 star Dungeon? To tell you the truth, if he manages just that Dungeon, he wouldn&#x2019;t need to renege on my annual salary.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;&#x2026;.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">He was right. Just by looking at the pattern in which Woojin attacked the Dungeons, he could tell the guild formed by Woojin will have a very bright future.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I have the chance to become a founding member. To tell you the truth, I could probably become a head of the Support Division.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">A position that handles everything that has to do with the Support teams. By the way he said those words, it seemed Haemin had dreamed of the position for a long time.</span></p><p><span style="">Minchan thought about it.</span></p><p><span style="">Where was his ambition? Where did he fit in the Hammer guild?</span></p><p><span style="">The Hammer guild&#x2019;s department heads, and the members of the board were all founding members. Even if he kept making serious contribution to the guild, Jung-minchan would never surpass them to become part of the management.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I&#x2019;ll also go.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Team leader.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">When he heard Minchan&#x2019;s decision, Kim-haemin took out his resignation letter he always carried around.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Do you always carry that around?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Heh heh. All salary man do so.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Jung-minchan grinned, and he also took out his resignation letter from the pocket of his suit. Haemin&#x2019;s eyes turned round.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;You too, team Leader?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;All salary man do so.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Kooo. Let&#x2019;s toss the resignation letter in style, then we can go have some soju.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;All right.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Jung-minchan and Kim-haemin headed towards their possible last day at the Hammer guild.</span></p><p><span style="">They took the elevator to the 11th floor where the 4th Support team was located at. The office lights were all turned off.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Uh?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The curtain was closed, and it was dark inside. He saw the members of his team standing around a cake with lit candles.</span></p><p><span style="">It wasn&#x2019;t only the 4th Support team. All of the Support teams were assembled in the room. Moreover, president Park-sahngoh, and vice president Park-jinwoo was also present.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Team leader Jung-minchan! Congratulation on being promoted to the head of the department!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Uh uh?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">While Minchan was being confused, President Park-sahngoh spoke as he laughed out loud.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hahaha. I had my eyes on Mr. Minchan, and I find the team leader position to be lacking. You will become the head of the Support Division starting tomorrow.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">As Minchan looked at them in surprise, his team members egged him on.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Team leader. Hurry up and blow out the candles.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Please don&#x2019;t forget about us after you become the department head.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hahaha. Congratulation on your promotion, team leader.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Huh huh.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Minchan was too flustered, so only laughter leaked out of him. He blew out the candles in bewilderment, and the office filled with people clapped.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Well, he is back after finalizing an incredible deal. He is a genius of negotiations. Please clap once again for Department Head Jung-minchan.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;You are so cool, department head!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Park-sahngoh started a chant, and the continuous clapping assaulted Minchan&#x2019;s ears. Minchan and Haemin had pale faces, and they were just laughing.</span></p><p><span style="">Yes, president. The genius of negotiation went to negotiate, but he was negotiated instead. He was ashamed of himself.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Excuse me, president.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ha ha ha. Let&#x2019;s go to the company dinner to hear your good news. I booked a really nice place to today.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Wahhhhh! It&#x2019;s a company dinner.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Huh huh huh.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">He could only laugh.</span></p><p><span style="">He could become the Hammer guild&#x2019;s department head or a founding member of a new guild.</span></p><p><span style="">The sweet fruit he had always wanted was in one hand, and a seed that could grow into anything was in the other.</span></p><p><span style="">Before he could hand over his resignation letter, everyone moved out towards the location where the company dinner was being held.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;T&#x2026;team leader. What should we do?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What do you expect me&#x2026;&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The flustered Haemin asked the question, but Minchan could only shake his head. Why was the president overdoing it today&#x2026;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ha-ah. They are throwing us a farewell party, so we should go.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">This big fuck up wasn&#x2019;t created by Jung-minchan. Park-sahngoh. The president brought it on himself. Minchan took out the resignation letters from his jacket, then he stabbed it into his back pocket.</span></p><p></p></div><p></p>
