<p><strong>Chapter 26 4 star Dungeon.</strong></p><p></p><div id="chapterContent" class="innerContent fr-view"><p></p><p><span style="">Chapter 26 &#x2013; 4 star Dungeon</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p><p><span style="">(TLN: This is a sponsored chapter. Thank you for the donation John. Queue is cleared. Please turn off the ad blockers if you are able to. Thanks and enjoy~)</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Team Leader. These guys made an appointment at the Gwachun Station&#x2019;s 6th exit?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Which guild does the Dungeon belong to?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;They are owned by the Hwarang guild.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Jung-minchan frowned.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;They are acting no better than poor noobs. &#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">It wasn&#x2019;t possible for an F ranked Roused to attempt a 4 star Dungeon. How could they not know such a basic thing? They just blindly made an appointment. It seemed they were nothing more than amateurs.</span></p><p><span style="">However, he hadn&#x2019;t verified their abilities himself, so it made him more curious. How much confidence do they have for them to attempt a 4 star Dungeon with only the two of them?</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Do we have a 4 star Dungeon near there&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;We do. It is the Chungsa station&#x2019;s 11th exit.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;It&#x2019;s right next door. Is there an appointment around that time?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Mmmm. It is scheduled for a training session for our new recruits.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Tell them to go elsewhere. Empty the schedule over there.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;If you want to catch a fish, then one has to throw in the chum. The bait.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">He always talked about fishing. Kim-haemin grumbled inside, then he started modifying the schedule.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;You come with me to Gwachun.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes. Yes.&#x201D; (TLN:lost in translation. Nae=yes. Haemin changed it to nae-ee)</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Sssoop. I&#x2019;ll go to the market. Prepare everything for me.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes, Yes.&#x201D; (TLN: he change nae to Nwei)</span></p><p><span style="">Haemin replied in a playful manner. Minchan hit him as he got up. Haemin was an asshole, but he trusted Haemin the most on his team. He was quick on the uptake, and he took care of business fast.</span></p><p><span style="">*</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin and Haemin reached the Gwachun station at the appointed time. However, Woojin had bumped into a precarious situation.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Aren&#x2019;t you only a F ranked Roused? Why are you here at a 4 star Dungeon? Moreover, there is only two of you&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ah. Didn&#x2019;t I say it was all right? I am very confident that we could do this.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Still, you can&#x2019;t go in.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;You don&#x2019;t have to take any responsibility for what happens to us. Just let us in.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;If you want to suicide, then go to the Hangang River. Why are you doing this over here? No. The regulation says so.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The Bureau employee blocked his way, and he wasn&#x2019;t budging. Sunggoo returned to Woojin with a hopeless expression on his face.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;H&#x2026;hyung-nim. I don&#x2019;t think we&#x2019;ll be able to go in. I&#x2019;m sorry. I should have found out everything about this place.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Sunggoo blamed himself since he had been too excited about signing his car contract yesterday. His earnings had significantly increased, but that was only possible since Woojin had gave away his earnings.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Well, we can&#x2019;t do anything about it.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I&#x2019;ll cover the lost appointment fee.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">It cost him $2,000 just to make an appointment.</span></p><p><span style="">The person in charge of the appointment never thought that 2 Ranked F would try to raid this Dungeon. The employee thought Sunggoo was making an appointment at the behest of an organization. This was why he accepted the appointment request.</span></p><p><span style="">This was a unique experience.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I guess we&#x2019;ll have to write-off today. I&#x2019;ll have to go to the Bureau to renew my rank. See if there is a 3 star Dungeon nearby.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes, sir.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Sunggoo had an apologetic face. He was about to move quickly when it happened.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Oh my. We meet again in such a place?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Uh?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Jung-minchan had a surprised expression on his face, and he approached Woojin and Sunggoo.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What a coincidence. I&#x2019;m sorry, but what&#x2019;s going on? If it&#x2019;s possible, I would like to lend a hand.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Sunggoo told Minchan about their situation. Minchan put on his thinking face, then he secretly glanced at Woojin to see how he was reacting.</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin could see through Jung-minchan&#x2019;s intent, so he grinned. Coinicidence? Bullshit.</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin gestured with his chin towards Sunggoo. It basically meant for Sunggoo to talk.</span></p><p><span style="">Sunggo gave a detailed explanation.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;So what if we do this? Our guild&#x2019;s Dungeon is located at the next station. I&#x2019;ll let you use that place.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Uh? Hy&#x2026;hyung-nim?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Sunggoo turned to looked at Woojin, and he waited for Woojin to make a decision. Woojin nonchalantly asked a question.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I&#x2019;m sure you expect no return for the favor?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Just a favorable impression toward us.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Minchan put on a friendly smile. This caused Woojin to laugh with him.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I&#x2019;ll use it with thanks.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;You are very straightforward.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Minchan smiled as he looked at Woojin.</span></p><p><span style="">His reaction was softer than yesterday.</span></p><p><span style="">No, he might not be a psycho in the first place. Yesterday&#x2019;s reaction might be an exception to the norm.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Haha. Follow me.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Minchan yelled in delight inside his heart as he escorted Woojin and Sunggoo. When they left, the dispatched employee of the Hwarang guild quickly made a call.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Team leader. Jung-michan came here not too long ago. He took two rank F Roused away, and he treated them like royalty.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">[What are you saying all of a sudden?]</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ah. Recently, two ranked F wanted to enter the 4 star Dungeon. They were being unreasonable, and argumentative. Do you remember the Team leader from the Hammer guild, who tried to act all elegant? He took the two Rank F to somewhere else. No, he pretty much escorted them out.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">[If that bastard Jung-minchan moved then something is fishy&#x2026;&#x2026;.]</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Right? It seems those bastards have something up their sleeves? The F ranks tried to attempt a 4 star Dungeon.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">[First, let&#x2019;s end the call. I&#x2019;ll try to find out some information about them.]</span></p><p><span style="">Hwarang guild&#x2019;s Support team leader also started to get busy.</span></p><p><span style="">The Gwachun Station and the Gwachun City Hall Station wasn&#x2019;t that far away. They walked for a short amount of time as they conversed, and they were able to arrive at their destination in no time.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;If you join our guild, you could have prevented such minor things from happeing in advance. Moreover, you could raise your Roused rank in a flash with us. Our guild is well known for giving a lot of support to our Roused.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">During the brief walk, Minchan had repeated numerous selling points of the Hammer guild. Woojin knew what was happening. This was the price for his favor. Woojin was expected to listen to him prattle on.</span></p><p><span style="">So, he decided to just listen.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Jeez. That seems quite convenient?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;It really is convenient. If one needs money then money is provided. If one needs an artifact then an artifact will be given. You will be provided with any support you want. &#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin replied to humor him a little bit.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;The members of the Hammer Guild must really like it.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hahaha. Thank you for acknowledging our guild.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">He somewhat spoke the truth.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ah, we are already here. Please be at ease as you use this Dungeon. You don&#x2019;t have to pay the fees for its use.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Is that also a favor?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Of course.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The fees for the 4 star Dungeons were known for being very high. However, he said he won&#x2019;t charge us at all, so it was a pretty significant favor.</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin didn&#x2019;t hesitated as he agreed to it.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I&#x2019;ll gratefully accept it. How about that public employee over there?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I&#x2019;ll quickly work to adjust Woojin-nim and Sunggoo-nim&#x2019;s ranks.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Those are some welcoming words.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">At Woojin&#x2019;s answer, Minchan smiled inside.</span></p><p><span style="">There were no favors without a string attached to it. No. Even if he didn&#x2019;t want something back, the favor he gave would put a favorable light in their heart for the Hammer guild.</span></p><p><span style="">If someone bought you a meal, then you&#x2019;ll naturally wonder if you have to buy the other person a meal the next time. It was human nature to feel this burden.</span></p><p><span style="">At the very least, Woojin would think more highly of the Hammer guild compared to the other guilds. When one builds a fire, one had to be sure to build a proper one.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Please wait a moment. I&#x2019;ve prepared a present for the two of you..&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Uh-ooh. You also got us a present?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin didn&#x2019;t show any signs of refusing the present. Michan yelled in delight inside his heart. As a Roused, his potential ability was mind-boggling, but Woojin was still a 24 year old cub.</span></p><p><span style="">He could tell Woojin hadn&#x2019;t had much of a societal life. He unhesitatingly took everything just because it was given. Minchan was sure now. This opponent had basically climbed on top of his palms.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Then please wait for a moment.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Minchan went to the car he had parked nearby to pick up the present. While Minchan was doing this, Kim-haemin turned towards the two. He tried to start a friendly conversation.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hehe. Mr. Woojin seems very different from yesterday.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Huh? What do you mean?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Uh-ooh. I was too scared to start a conversation with you.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin laughed at Haemin&#x2019;s brashness. His head was a mess yesterday, because he was thinking about Trahnet.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yesterday I wasn&#x2019;t feeling so well.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hehe. You must be a man who act on his feelings. Now that I see you today it seems you have a good personality. Do you want to have some soju after this ends?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;That&#x2019;ll be great.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Ah. He&#x2019;ll welcome soju anytime.</span></p><p><span style="">Haemin tactfully praised Woojin and Sunggoo. He tried hard to match their moods.</span></p><p><span style="">Sunggoo could only shake his head when he saw them act like this. They were trying hard to fawn over Woojin, but would he actually join the guild?</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;These guys are barking up the wrong tree. Tsk tsk.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">Sunggoo felt sorry for Minchan and Haemin. They were purposefully trying to be on the same beat as Woojin. Woojin wasn&#x2019;t evil, but he didn&#x2019;t have a conscience.</span></p><p><span style="">Sunggoo thought his hyung-nim looked splendid when he acted that way.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ah, I&#x2019;m getting bored waiting for him. Tell him to give me the present after I come back out.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ah. You want to do that?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I&#x2019;ll see you later. We&#x2019;ll talk over some soju.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hehe. I&#x2019;ll take you to a great place.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin and Sunggoo quickly descended the stairway.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;We gave you plenty of time for your appointment. Fighting.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin grinned and he disappeared as he waved his hand. As he watched them disappear in to the barrier, Kim-haemin smiled brightly, and he waved his hand.</span></p><p><span style="">Suddenly, Haemin felt a terrifying sensation. His neck retreated into itself like a turtle then he turned his head to his side.</span></p><p><span style="">Waa, his heart.</span></p><p><span style="">Team leader Jung-minchan was frowning as he glared at Haemin.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hey. What the hell are you doing?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I&#x2019;m&#x2026;I&#x2019;m seeing them off?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">A vein popped out on Jung-michan&#x2019;s forehead.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Didn&#x2019;t I say I&#x2019;ll go get the present?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Haha. Weren&#x2019;t&#x2026;weren&#x2019;t you going to wait for them to clear it before you were going to give it to them? Just give it to them when they come out.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">At Haemin&#x2019;s words, Jung-minchan felt himself raise his hand in anger. He was barely able to hold himself back. He dropped the bag he brought on the floor. The large sports-bag let out a thump as it fell on to the floor.</span></p><p><span style="">It was quite heavy, so the impact ripped the zipper open, and the content was revealed.</span></p><p><span style="">There were water filters, first-aid kit, cloth and a seeker. Moreover, it held a map with the location of the Return stone, and a Dungeon guide with the location of the enemy&#x2019;s position.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;A survival kit?&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">The 1~3 star Dungeons were low level Dungeons. The 4~6 star Dungeons were high ranked Dungeons.</span></p><p><span style="">It wasn&#x2019;t simply about the classification of high rank and low rank. There was a fundamental difference in the structure of the Dungeons.</span></p><p><span style="">The present Jung-minchan had prepared was none other than a survival kit.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;The F ranked bastards came to attempt a high ranked Dungeon, but how much do you think they know about the high ranked Dungeons?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;That, that is&#x2026;&#x2026;.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Haemin&#x2019;s face was turning pale. The recommended team composition for attacking a 4 star Dungeon was to have a Rank C team leader. The rest of the Roused team had to be at least Rank D.</span></p><p><span style="">However, only two of them entered without any information about the Dungeon.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;This isn&#x2019;t a favor any more. We basically cornered them into the jaws of death.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;&#x2026;.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">A 4 star Dungeon with no information about it&#x2026;. It was a horrifying situation.</span></p><p><span style="">Haemin spoke carefully.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Do&#x2026;do you think they&#x2019;ll come back alive?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;They basically went into jungle barehanded.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;&#x2026;.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Haemin&#x2019;s face turned white. From the beginning, he should have said it was a survival kit instead of a present. Minchan and Haemin didn&#x2019;t speak for a while.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Exscuse me, team leader. What if they do?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What happens if they do come back alive?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Well&#x2026;&#x2026;.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">They had gone to the jungle barehanded. Moreover, if they returned alive from a place crawling with monsters, and it was only the two of them instead of a team&#x2026;..</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;At the very least, they will be Rank B.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Minchan&#x2019;s face turned dark as he spat out those words.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Moreover, they&#x2019;ll probably be filled with animosity. They won&#x2019;t have any goodwill towards our guild.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">They had cornered them into the jaws of death without giving them any proper information. No, he wouldn&#x2019;t be able to say anything if they accused him of pushing them in a trap after digging it. They would also be reprimanded from the Roused Affairs Bureau.</span></p><p><span style="">On the surface, it looked like they had thrown two rank F Roused into a 4 star Dungeon.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Whew. Hurry up and tell them to change their Roused rank right now.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Jung-minchan&#x2019;s sigh made Haemin more timid.</span></p><p><span style="">*</span></p><p>&lt;You have enter the Gwachun City Hall Station&#x2019;s 11th exit.&gt;</p><p>&lt;This Dungeon has already been captured. The basic monsters will be summoned.&gt;</p><p><span style="">Woojin and Sunggoo steadily went down to the lower floors. Woojin defeated the monsters, and he searched for the bloodstones. Then he marked the corpses with his Marking magic. Sunggoo followed after him, and he cut open the monster&#x2019;s corpses to bag the bloodstones.</span></p><p><span style="">They had been nervous since this was a 4 star Dungeon, but the monsters were much weaker than they had expected. It was on the same level as the monsters from the 2 star and 3 star Dungeons.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Are you really sure this is a 4 star Dungeon?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I&#x2026;I&#x2019;m not sure&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">He hadn&#x2019;t fought against the monsters, so he had no idea. Even the 2 star monsters had been a tough opponent for Sunggoo. Therefore, he could&#x2019;t tell the difference. Woojin said they were weak, so he just took Woojin&#x2019;s words at face value.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Maybe this Dungeon is more easier than the average Dungeon?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Well, who knows? Let&#x2019;s quickly dispatch them then we could head out.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin cleared the lowest floor where the subway train would be parked then he used his Search magic. For the first time since he had entered the Dungeons, Woojin was taken aback.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What? The Return Stone isn&#x2019;t here.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What? That can&#x2019;t be&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Sunggoo stopped extracting the bloodstones. He approached Woojin with a worried expression on his face.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Maybe my Search Skill level is too low?&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">If he increased the Search Skill level, it would only increase the search radius. If an item was hidden in a secret location, he had to learn a higher ranked magic. This required one to be a Magician class.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Mmmm. Well, let&#x2019;s search again as we head back. Extract the rest of the bloodstones.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes, hyung-nim.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin was suspicious as to whether this Dungeon was really a 4 star. The quality of the monster here was subpar. He had a method that could accurately measure this.</span></p><p><span style="">Achievement Points.</span></p><p><span style="">Monsters of Rakwi quality gave 3 Achievement Points. The bloodstone drop rate wasn&#x2019;t that high, but there were a lot of them. He thought it would be better to attack a spot where a lot of Rakwis spawned.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I&#x2019;ve excavated them all, hyung-nim.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Then let&#x2019;s search for the Return Stone as we head toward the Station&#x2019;s entrance.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The Return Stone doesn&#x2019;t always come out from the monster&#x2019;s corpse. It could be hidden in various locations. This was why Woojin retraced his steps, and he used the Search Magic again.</span></p><p><span style="">Even as he approached the entrance, there was no trace of the Return Stone. He suddenly felt uneasy.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;If we ascend here, it&#x2019;ll be the entrance&#x2026;&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Sunggoo mumbled to himself. When they climbed the stair, a portal emitting a red light formed in front of the barrier.</span></p><p><span style="">Weeeeeeee.</span></p><p><span style="">It let out a strange sound. Woojin and Sunggoo looked at it with a queer expression on their faces.</span></p><p></p></div><p></p>
