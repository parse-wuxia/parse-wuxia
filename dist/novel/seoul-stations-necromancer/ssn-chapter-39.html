I&#x2019;ll try to get a regular chapter out tomorrow. Thank you for the donation John. Please turn off the adblockers if you are able to. Thanks and enjoy.)</span></p><p><span style="">They had already passed by 5 Oasis.</span></p><p><span style="">During that time, they had found 3 Artifacts. They were also able to earn a lot of bloodstones, and all of it had been placed inside Woojin&#x2019;s sub-dimension.</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin and Sunggoo arrived at the last field.</span></p><p><span style="">There were crumbling walls, and the road was covered with sand. Trees were growing sparsely, and it was an indication that there were life here.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;W..what do you think of this place?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ragrecia.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;It is the name of an abandoned city.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hul. How do you even know the name of the city, hyung-nim?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;It&#x2019;s written over there.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin pointed toward the gates leading to the collapsed city. Sunggoo tilted his head in confusion as he looked at the undecipherable letters.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;How does he know this?&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">He was able to speak with the Orcs last time. Now he was able to read the writings found within the Dungeon.</span></p><p><span style="">However, he wasn&#x2019;t going to ask about it. He was just curious. He didn&#x2019;t want to be berated for asking unnecessary questions.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;You&#x2019;ll really have to be careful from now on.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes, sir!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin scratched his cheek when he saw Sunggoo answer bravely. If the danger went away just by the person being careful, then no one would die inside the Dungeon.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Mmmm. Wait.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin searched his inventory, then he took out a leather armor.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;This isn&#x2019;t suited for a Magician, but it had a pretty good defense. Try putting it on.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;H..hyung-nim.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Sunggoo was close to tears as he accepted and wore the armor given by Woojin. It was made out of leather, but there was something hard covering the chest, and sides.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Uh? It feels like my body has become lighter.</span></p><p><span style="">&lt;Recia&#x2019;s Blessing&gt;</span></p><p><span style="">An armor worn by the soldiers of Ragrecia. It is a fairly heavy armor, but it increases agility by 5.</span></p><p><span style="">Skill : Acceleration</span></p><p><span style="">After the elated Sunggoo put on the armor, Woojin spoke to him.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;It is an Artifact imbued with magic. You said the Roused could use it?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes, hyung-nim.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Try using it.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Sunggoo was surprised as he started touching his armor.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Does this have an imbued skill?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The price of the Artifacts depended on what kind of ability it had, and the price varied.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Use it.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes, sir.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Sunggoo spat out a surprised sound when he put his magic into the armor. It felt like his body was floating, and it made him feel dizzy. Moreover, a pain lanced through his head as if he had just ate a cold ice cream.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Uh uh?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Try moving around.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">At Woojin&#x2019;s direction, Sunggoo was moving his body from side to side when he fell.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Wow!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The fallen Sunggoo was surprised, He got up, and he started to speedily move around the surrounding. He was moving twice as fast as his normal speed. However, the amount of magic possessed by Sunggoo was quite meager, so his movement decreased soon.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Huk. It seems I can only maintain it for 30 seconds with my ability.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Can you use your fireball in that state?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Sunggoo tried to use his fireball magic. The fireball formed much slower than before.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Whether it is the skill used through the Artifact, or one&#x2019;s natural skill, the Roused has to provide all the mana.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">He won&#x2019;t have any cause to use his flame magic. The armor will adjust his agility, and the Acceleration skill could be used for evasion. Sunggoo would have no problem surviving.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;You are less likely to die if you are able to dodge well. However, you should still be careful.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes, sir.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;When the moment of danger comes, don&#x2019;t put your trust in me. Protect your own life. Don&#x2019;t expect others to protect you&#x2026;.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;yes. I&#x2019;ll keep that in mind.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin wasn&#x2019;t Sunggoo&#x2019;s protector. He couldn&#x2019;t&#x2019; always keep an eye on Sunggoo on the chaotic battle field. If he died, then it was his fate.</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin could always acquire a new errand boy, but he kind of liked Sunggoo. Woojin decided to prepare him as well as he could, then he would just have to hope Sunggoo will live a long life.</span></p><p><span style="">It didn&#x2019;t matter what Woojin felt. In the end, everyone had to defend for themselves.</span></p><p><span style="">Sunggoo had to no choice, but to be watchful and alert.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;The monster that will appear is of the anthropomorphic race. They are called the Naga. I don&#x2019;t know how many there are, but they put poison on their weapons. Be careful. &#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Ragrecia was an abandoned city.</span></p><p><span style="">The fallen houses, and the thatch-less buildings created a maze. Desert rats were hiding in every corner, and they kept attacking. Woojin sent the Skeleton Soldiers forward to act as a pathfinder, and they also cleared the path.</span></p><p><span style="">The Skeleton Soldiers performed well in their role as scouts.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Kyahhh!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Accompanying a horrible shriek, a spear came flying through the air, and it hit a Skeleton Soldier walking in the front. The spear embedded itself in the skull. The skull of the Skeleton Soldier broke, and it crumbled to the floor.</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin ran out of the alley, and 3 Naga Soldiers appeared.</span></p><p><span style="">The lower half of a snake had merge with the torso of a human. The Naga looked rough, and they used weapons dipped with poison.</span></p><p>&lt;Lvl 56 Naga Soldier&gt;</p><p><span style="">It was unfortunate for them, but the Skeleton Soldier couldn&#x2019;t be poisoned.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Kee-kee-keek.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Keh keh.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The Skeleton Soldiers quickly ran towards the Naga Soldiers, but it wasn&#x2019;t enough. The bone swords couldn&#x2019;t penetrate through the armors they wore on their torso, and it also couldn&#x2019;t break through the scales surrounding the lower half of their body.</span></p><p><span style="">The Naga Soldier&#x2019;s spear was fast and accurate. The Skeleton Soldier&#x2019;s skull was crushed with a single blow. Even if there was a gap in strength, superior numbers could still be used to push the enemy.</span></p><p><span style="">Even though the Skeleton Soldiers were level 17, it didn&#x2019;t pose any threat to the Naga Soldiers. The Skeleton Magicians were probably more of a threat, but the Naga Soldiers quickly hid themselves behind the terrain. Therefore, the Skeleton Magicians weren&#x2019;t that effective.</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin kicked at the remain of bones leftover after the Skeleton Soldier had been demolished.</span></p><p><span style="">Puh-puhk.</span></p><p><span style="">The stack of bones were scattered everywhere.</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin aimed his Bone Spear at the Naga Warriors. He threw the Bone spear.</span></p><p><span style="">Chw-rah-rahk!</span></p><p><span style="">It flew at high speed as it spiraled. The thrown Bone spear was powerful enough to catch the attention of the Naga Warriors. A Naga Warrior&#x2019;s spear blocked Woojin&#x2019;s bone spear.</span></p><p><span style="">[Retreat!]</span></p><p><span style="">The Naga Soldiers quickly disengaged from the Skeleton Soldiers, then they tried to widen their distance from the enemies. However, Woojin immediately summon his Wall of Bones. Pieces of bones shot out in all direction, and one of the Naga Warrior was skewered.</span></p><p><span style="">Chwaaaahk!</span></p><p><span style="">The Naga Soldiers had been surprised by the sudden appearance of a wall, and now a steel spear was flying towards them.</span></p><p><span style="">Boom!</span></p><p><span style="">They couldn&#x2019;t blocked it. No. Even if they did block it, the result wouldn&#x2019;t have changed.</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin had used the level 20 Warrior&#x2019;s Skill, &#x2018;Throw&#x2019;. He threw his spear, and it was sufficiently strong enough to kill the Naga.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Release, summon.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Pah-paht.</span></p><p><span style="">At Woojin&#x2019;s command, the spear stuck inside the Naga Warrior&#x2019;s heart disappeared, and it was summoned back within Woojin&#x2019;s grasp.</span></p><p><span style="">The Warrior&#x2019;s weapon evolved alongside the Warrior.</span></p><p><span style="">The various ways one could use it was endless.</span></p><p>&lt;Throw&gt;</p><p><span style="">When one throws one&#x2019;s weapon, it is the Final attack. When one let&#x2019;s go of the weapon, one has to bet everything on it. The speed is increased proportional to one&#x2019;s strength. The accuracy is increased proportional to one&#x2019;s Agility.</span></p><p><span style="">The Warrior Class had many innate skills. There were a lot of basic passive skills like Warrior&#x2019;s Senses, Throw, and Spearsmanship.</span></p><p><span style="">Moreover, the endlessly recoverable Warrior&#x2019;s Weapon was well suited for being used as a throwing weapon.</span></p><p><span style="">The purpose of Skeleton Soldier&#x2019;s attack was to occupy their attention. That had bee enough.</span></p><p><span style="">Shwahhhk! Boom!</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin&#x2019;s body was bent back like a bow. He let go of the spear as he shot his body forward, and the spear accurately pierced the Naga Soldier&#x2019;s heart.</span></p><p><span style="">The last remaining Nag Soldier was dismayed. Woojin looked towards it, and he opened his mouth.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ria ni Le root ta. Reona raket.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Riket La? Reona Raketa nia.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin once again spoke in words Sunggoo couldn&#x2019;t understand, and this time he wasn&#x2019;t confused by it.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;My god. How many languages does he know?&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">He admired Woojin. Every move made by Woojin made him surprised routinely. He just took hyung-nim smartness as a given.</span></p><p><span style="">[If you want to protect the Naga&#x2019;s temple, then gather all of your Warriors and wait for me.]</span></p><p><span style="">[Who are you? Tell me the reason why you are trying to trespass into the Naga&#x2019;s temple.]</span></p><p><span style="">[My reason is the same as yours. I just want to protect earth akin to the Naga protecting its temple.]</span></p><p><span style="">[The guardians of the temple will all be gathered to repel you.]</span></p><p><span style="">While they were conversing, Woojin took down the Wall of Bones. Sunggoo had a quizzical expression on his face when Woojin spared one Naga.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hyung-nim. Why did you let one go? Moreover, what did you say&#x2026;&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I told them to attack me with a large force.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;&#x2026;.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Wouldn&#x2019;t it be dangerous? They looked really strong.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Wouldn&#x2019;t it be cool?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;&#x2026;.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">What? What was cool? Think, Sunggoo. The answer is already determined. Find the answer. Find the answer hyung-nim wants.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;An expert like me&#x2026;&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes, hyung-nim.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;can use words to create a Train.&#x201D; (TLN: he used a gaming term. basically lining up/gathering enemies.)</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;&#x2026;.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Is that what he meant? Wasn&#x2019;t the Train used to round up easy monsters to kill? At a glance, the Skeleton Soldiers was incredibly inadequate to face these opponents&#x2026;</span></p><p><span style="">However, hyung-nim must think otherwise.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;You are very cool.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hoo hoo, let&#x2019;s go. If I had to hunt down all the Naga, then it would have taken half a day.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin was excited about the fact that he&#x2019;ll be able to fight all the Naga in one sitting. Sunggoo was a little bit worried as he followed Woojin from the back.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;I&#x2019;m level 30, so I should be able to do some group hunting.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin earned a main skill every 10 levels. The Golem summon was one of the skills, but he had also earned an essential attack skill that was critical to Woojin.</span></p><p><span style="">If he hadn&#x2019;t reached level 30 right now, he wouldn&#x2019;t have forced himself to hunt a group. However, he was level 30 now, so he would be able to do it.</span></p><p><span style="">In the middle of the city, there was a large tower standing high over the city.</span></p><p><span style="">The Naga Warriors were packed around the tower.There were a little bit less than 100 Naga Warriors.</span></p><p><span style="">Sunggoo swallowed dryly.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;H&#x2026;hyung-nim. Aren&#x2019;t there too many of them?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;It&#x2019;ll be dangerous, so you should wait here.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes, hyung-nim.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin marched confidently in step with the Skeleton Soldiers. He lead them from the front.</span></p><p><span style="">[Are you the impudent human trying to take the temple?]</span></p><p><span style="">[Can we dispense with the long speech?]</span></p><p><span style="">[We will protect the temple at all costs.]</span></p><p><span style="">The Naga Soldiers&#x2019; fighting spirit burned brighter. There were 80 Skeleton Soldiers behind Woojin. He still had enough Control stat to make more, but he didn&#x2019;t want to summon the maximum number.</span></p><p><span style="">In this Dungeon, the Skeleton Soldier&#x2019;s role was insignificant. However, they were a linchpin for what he was about to do in this battlefield.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Charge!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Kee kee kee!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The Skeleton Soldiers let out its unique yell, and they quickly charged forward. They were already dead, so fear didn&#x2019;t slow them down.</span></p><p><span style="">He didn&#x2019;t even need to vocalize his orders. They were beings under the control of Woojin.</span></p><p><span style="">He just needed to use his will to change their formation, and they would move like his limbs.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Kee kee kee!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The Skeleton Soldiers ran forward with force, but their numbers were cut down quickly by the Naga Warrior&#x2019;s spears.</span></p><p><span style="">However, Woojin didn&#x2019;t look worried.</span></p><p><span style="">When the last Skeleton Soldier was destroyed, a very large Naga Warrior stepped forward.</span></p><p>&lt;lv 61 Naga Great Warrior.&gt;</p><p><span style="">&#x2018;I guess the boss mob only comes out only once in the beginning.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">The &#x2018;Naga Chieftain&#x2019; that showed up in his first raid was absent now. One of the 5 great warriors that had stood by the Naga Chieftain was this field&#x2019;s boss this time around.</span></p><p><span style="">The difficulty was much lower compared to the first raid.</span></p><p><span style="">[You dare to invade the temple with such an inferior Undead army?]</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin waited in the back as all of his Skeleton Soldiers were destroyed. Woojin laughed</span></p><p><span style="">[The Undead Army?]</span></p><p><span style="">The Undead army had always faced the Trahnet army as an enemy.</span></p><p><span style="">[If your voices reaches Trahnet, then there is something you should inform him.]</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin summoned two Bone Spears for each hand. With twin spears in his hand, Woojin started to walk forward.</span></p><p><span style="">One step. Two step.</span></p><p><span style="">[I, the owner of Alandal, is on earth.]</span></p><p><span style="">Third step. Fourth Step.</span></p><p><span style="">As he took more steps, his speed became faster. On the last step, he jumped high into the air.</span></p><p><span style="">Hoooohng.</span></p><p><span style="">He looked down from mid-air, and he was able to see everything. Wooojin looked at the pieces of bones littered around the Naga Warriors.</span></p><p><span style="">A large amount of magical energy exited his body.</span></p><p><span style="">Chwa-jah-hajk.</span></p><p><span style="">The pieces of bone fused with each other as it grew. It formed a massive Wall of Bones.</span></p><p><span style="">No. It was a Bone Prison. The Naga was surround by the Wall of Bones. Woojin fell right in the middle of the crowd.</span></p><p><span style="">Kwah-jeek!</span></p><p><span style="">An unlucky Naga Warrior took Woojin&#x2019;s knee to its head, and the skull burst open.</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin pierced the Bone Spear he held in both hands into the Naga Warrior&#x2019;s head.</span></p><p><span style="">The Naga Warriors nearby ran forward to surround Woojin. A shock-wave emanated from the embedded Bone Spear. It spread out with the Bone Spear as its focal point.</span></p><p><span style="">Puh-uhk!</span></p><p><span style="">The Naga Warriors were pushed back all at once by the green shock wave. The damaged caused by the shock-wave was minimal.</span></p><p><span style="">Green smoke started to spread, and it clouded the Naga&#x2019;s vision.</span></p><p><span style="">When the green colored poison suddenly spread, the Naga lost control of their senses. The poison stopped one from breathing, and it ate away one&#x2019;s blood.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Kyahh, kyahk!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Rigen Kehta!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The Naga Warriors died as they let out a pain-filled scream. When he saw the state of the Naga Warriors, Woojin laughed harder.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I also know how to use some poison.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The Naga&#x2019;s snake venom couldn&#x2019;t even be compared to Wooijin&#x2019;s poison.</span></p><p></p></div><p></p>
