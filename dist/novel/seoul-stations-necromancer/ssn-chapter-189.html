<p><span style="">Chapter 189 - Lord of Ice (1) </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;That is unfortunate.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Unlike his words, Woojin&apos;s face displayed his indifference. &#xA0;The pupils of Nakamura shook.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I...I&apos;m sorry. &#xA0;For a moment, my greed...&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">The light in Woojin&apos;s eyes stayed steady even as he heard Nakamura&apos;s entreaty.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;You should just die.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Why waste a Dimensional Proof to take over his Colony?</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin had only worried about external enemies. &#xA0;He had been too complacent about the enemies within.</span></p><p><span style="">In the long history of earth, who had killed the most humans?</span></p><p><span style="">Monsters?</span></p><p><span style="">After the Dungeon Shock, they had killed a lot of humans in a short amount of time. &#xA0;The fear and the threat of the monsters had somewhat united the humans, but unfortunately, humans were still responsible for killing the most humans on earth.</span></p><p><span style="">Humans were divided into various groups, and these groups went through numerous struggles. &#xA0;These continuous struggles resulted in harm and death.</span></p><p><span style="">For a brief moment, these groups had allied with each other thanks to a big external threat. &#xA0;However, the signs of change was once again on the horizon.</span></p><p><span style="">It wouldn&apos;t be strictly a fight between Dimensional lords and the people of earth anymore. &#xA0;The line between allies and enemies would blur. &#xA0;In the end, each faction would fight against each other.</span></p><p><span style="">Nakamura, who was in front of him, was a prime example.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Oooh ooh oohk. &#xA0;S...stop.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Nakamura screamed, but Woojin&apos;s grip continued to tighten. &#xA0;Nakamura felt a headache as if his head would soon explode.</span></p><p><span style="">He was dying. &#xA0;He hadn&apos;t experienced it before, and the fear of the unknown made Nakamura weak.</span></p><p><span style="">He couldn&apos;t win against Woojin.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Fuck. &#xA0;We aren&apos;t the same...&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">He had found out not all Dimensional lords were equal.</span></p><p><span style="">Winning wasn&#x2019;t even part of the equation for him.</span></p><p><span style="">Crunch!</span></p><p><span style="">&#x3008;You&apos;ve cleared the Colony.&#x3009;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x3008;Please choose between Destruction or Capture.&#x3009;</span></p><p><span style="">When Woojin chose Capture, another one of his Dimensional Fragment was used up, and a wait time had appeared.</span></p><p><span style="">One day.</span></p><p><span style="">If he wanted to use the functions of a Colony, he had to wait one more day.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;This is annoying&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">He would have to waste time, because of this bastard&#x2019;s antics. &#xA0;Woojin looked at his surrounding.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What the hell is this&#x2026;. &#xA0;Uh-whew.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin&#x2019;s brows furrowed when he saw the large palace built in front of the World Tree. &#xA0;He would need to fully seize his Colony to get the exact figure, but Nakamura seemed to have spend a lot of Points.</span></p><p><span style="">Did he say he was from the Daken guild? &#xA0;When Woojin returned to earth, he would have to regain what he had lost with interest from the Daken guild.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What are you guys doing?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;You should go do your jobs.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Tauric and the others had been imprisoned until a moment ago, so they were confused by his words. &#xA0;Woojin pointed towards the outer castle walls with his chin.</span></p><p><span style="">The goblins were fighting the forces of the Coalition. &#xA0;&#xA0;Some of the goblins were cooperating with each other, and they were pushing into the inner walls. </span></p><p><span style="">It was a clusterfuck.</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin had merely forced his way past the defense to climb to the top of the Saurus Mountain.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Are you planning on letting them all die?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ah!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The heroes of the Coalition went forth to calm the situation. &#xA0;The only ones left behind with Woojin was the Holy Maiden and the Phantom Unit.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hey, Haesol.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin shook the still unconscious Che-haesol. &#xA0;However, she didn&#x2019;t move. &#xA0;He placed his hand beneath her nose, and she was still breathing. She just refused to wake up.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What&apos;s wrong with her?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;One of the people from earth injected her with something.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hmmm.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">It was unknown whether it was a sleeping or an anesthetic drug.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Wake her up, Melody.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I can&apos;t.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Huh?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The Holy Maiden can do task that were considered to be impossible by the modern medical science.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;It isn&#x2019;t as if I&#x2019;m asking you to revive a dead person. &#xA0;Why can&#x2019;t &#xA0;you do it?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I was abandoned by the goddess.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Huh?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">When Woojin tilted his head in confusion, she had to give an additional explanation. &#xA0;&#xA0;Melody crumbled to the ground, and she cried.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;things turned out so bad, because I didn&#x2019;t follow the oracle. &#xA0;Hoo-oohk.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Mmmm.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">After hearing Melody&#x2019;s rambling explanation, Woojin stroked his chin.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;So it didn&#x2019;t matter if you burned the World Tree or not, since these bastards crossed over to Alphen. &#xA0;Both scenario would have resulted in me losing the Colony.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Anyways, I need a day for Synchronization...&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ah..&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin had wasted almost no time in getting rid of Nakamura, who had occupied his Colony. &#xA0;At most, it took him an hour.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Still, you did good.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;If you burned it, I would have been really angry.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;&#x2026;.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Yes. &#xA0;He would have been. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">She couldn&#x2019;t bear the consequences brought on by the Immortal, so she hadn&#x2019;t carried out the oracle. &#xA0;As a result, she had lost everything.</span></p><p><span style="">The Immortal&#x2019;s wrath was avoided, but they had lost time.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What about Haesol, president? &#xA0;Is she going to die?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin shrugged his shoulders at Blanka&#x2019;s words.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;She&#x2019;ll probably wake up when the drug wears off.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">He had no idea what kind of drug was used. &#xA0;Since she wasn&#x2019;t dead yet, he doubted she would die.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Bring me any bastard from the Daken guild when you guys come across one. &#xA0;I need to know what drug they used if I want to treat it.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">When the Colony was completely taken over, he would be able to return to earth. &#xA0;Whether it was an antidote or a stimulant, earth will have it.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I&#x2019;m sorry. &#xA0;This is all my...&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Woojin shrugged his shoulder at Melody&#x2019;s words.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;It&#x2019;s all right.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;&#x2026;.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Melody&#x2019;s dropped her head. &#xA0;The Immortal was showing such magnanimity&#x2026;.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;So you lost your abilities in its entirety??&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;&#x2026;.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;yes.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin took out Aria&#x2019;s Circlet, and he pushed it towards her. &#xA0;Melody took the Item in a moment of bewilderment, and she looked up at him.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;You don&#x2019;t feel anything even though you are touching it?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I feel an energy, but&#x2026;. &#xA0;It is completely different from before.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hmmm. &#xA0;It means you are able to feel magical energy.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin looked at her, and Melody&#x2019;s level had remained the same.</span></p><p><span style="">She was akin to a S Rank Roused, who had lost a Skill.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;That noonim is pretty petty.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">He didn&#x2019;t know if he should call Aria as noonim or a hunk of machine.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;You are unemployed now. &#xA0;Come work under me.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">A Holy Maiden had lost her Holy Power, so it wasn&#x2019;t a problem that could be easily glossed over...</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;When my Colony is finished, you can protect it here.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">He made a mistake in not appointing an admin for his Colony. &#xA0;&#xA0;If he had to deal with internal and external problems occurring here, Woojin would have to be tethered to the Colony. &#xA0;He would rather appoint a new administrator.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I&apos;m going to earth.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;&#x2026;.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Why aren&#x2019;t you answering me?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;&#x2026;.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Melody&#x2019;s shaking eyes gazed at Woojin.</span></p><p><span style="">He&#x2019;ll put her in charge of the Colony? &#xA0;Her? &#xA0;What was the basis of his belief in her?</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;You trust me?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Huh.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Woojin laughed as he was dumbfounded by what he had just heard.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What are you talking about?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What if I betray the Immortal again? &#xA0;Isn&#x2019;t that a possibility?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Why would you?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin approached Melody, and he put his face in front of her face. &#xA0;Their faces were a handspan apart from each other .</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Didn&#x2019;t you ask me to help Alphen?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;correct.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">For no reason at all, she felt embarrassed. &#xA0;Melody was barely able to answer him.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;If you betray me, I&#x2019;ll just throw Alphen away. &#xA0;At that point, I wouldn&#x2019;t care if the gate was closed or not.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ah&#x2026;.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">So that was what he meant.</span></p><p><span style="">Melody understood his words, yet a corner of her heart was somehow a bit disappointed.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;You do what you need to do.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;yes.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin went to the side wall of the palace. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">He approached a flame that was burning with fortitude.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;This damn guy isn&#x2019;t awake yet.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Hwah-roo-rook.</span></p><p><span style="">It was as if the flame could understand his words. &#xA0;There was no winds, yet the flame danced.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;You are too greedy. &#xA0;When you think it is enough, I want you to wake up and come to earth. &#xA0;I&#x2019;ll be heading there first.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Hwah-roo-roohk.</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin smirked, and he turned away.</span></p><p><span style="">It had been awhile, since Sunggoo had digested the Dragon&#x2019;s Heart. &#xA0;He hadn&#x2019;t woken up yet, because he was very greedy.</span></p><p><span style="">Sunggoo was being patient, because it allowed him to be born much stronger and more perfect.</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin&#x2019;s Colony was restricted, so he couldn&apos;t use the Dimensional Store. &#xA0;This was why he opened his Achievement Store. &#xA0;He had stored up a lot of Points.</span></p><p><span style="">Even now his Undead army was on a warpath, and they were constantly giving him more Points.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Shall i get my equipment back now?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Thrash&#x2019;s Set Items.</span></p><p><span style="">The core Ingredients that weren&#x2019;t sold in the Dimensional Store or the Achievement Store were gathered. &#xA0;All the other ingredients were going to be bought through the Store.</span></p><p><span style="">He didn&#x2019;t spare his Points. &#xA0;He started buying all the Ingredients. &#xA0;A mountainous amount of Items were bought, and one by one it was put into the Combiner. &#xA0;His Items were being completed.</span></p><p><span style="">***</span></p><p><span style="">One day had passed.</span></p><p><span style="">The false rumor, which said the Immortal had betrayed everyone, was put to rest. &#xA0;The Coalition was being put back together again.</span></p><p><span style="">Unfortunately, the captured members of the Daken guild said the substance injected into Haesol didn&#x2019;t have an antidote.</span></p><p><span style="">However, they were lucky in the fact that the drug lost its efficacy as time passed. &#xA0;She would wake up later, but they could just carry Haesol around everywhere.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;You really won&#x2019;t regret this?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes, sir. &#xA0;We&#x2019;ll return when our team leader wakes up.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">The entire Phantom Unit decided to stay behind with Haesol, so Woojin allowed it without much protestation. &#xA0;It wasn&#x2019;t as if earth was in imminent danger, so they weren&#x2019;t needed.</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin knew Thrash&#x2019;s Executioner was on earth, and he had to find clues there. &#xA0;He&#x2019;ll be able to accomplish this by himself.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Guard the Gate closely.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;You will never lose your way again.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Woojin smirked at Melody&#x2019;s stout words. &#xA0;He patted her shoulder.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;When Haesol wakes up, tell her to cross over. &#xA0;If Sunggoo wakes up, he should also come to earth immediately.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Shall we head back?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">While Woojin went through many happenings and events, the Undead Army had swept through a large swaths of land. </span></p><p><span style="">The nearby Dimensional lords and monsters were eradicated..</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin called back his Undead Army.</span></p><p><span style="">When he unsummoned them, they resolved into black smoke around Woojin. &#xA0;The black smoke swirled around before it disappeared en masse. &#xA0;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">He could feel the energy of his Familiars occupying his Summon Room. &#xA0;They had an unbreakable bond with Woojin.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I&apos;ll return soon. &#xA0;Wait for me.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin was sent off by the heroes of Alphen, and he went across the gate.</span></p><p><span style="">***</span></p><p><span style="">Alandal&#x2019;s Flying Fortress, Bibi&#x2019;s Castle.</span></p><p><span style="">Minchan sat within the Prime Minister&#x2019;s office, and he let out a long sigh.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;This is driving me nuts.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">How much gravity did Kahng-woojin exert from Alandal?</span></p><p><span style="">It wouldn&#x2019;t be an exaggeration to say Kahng-woojin was the bulk of what Alandal is. &#xA0;His absence created a lot of problem.</span></p><p><span style="">The Dimensional lords and the monsters were threatening the people of earth. &#xA0;There was an expectation on what role Alandal should play in this situation, yet Alandal hadn&#x2019;t come up with a solution.</span></p><p><span style="">They used Points through the moving fortress to eradicate the monsters, but the scale of the attack was limited to what a normal guild could do.</span></p><p><span style="">Even defeating one of the Dimensional lords forming a Colony was almost beyond their capacity.</span></p><p><span style="">Since Alandal couldn&#x2019;t solve the problem, the negative press was getting louder. </span></p><p><span style="">This in turn increased the stress felt by Jung-minchan.</span></p><p><span style="">Beep.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x300C;Prime Minister. &#xA0;Bibi-nim is here for a visit.&#x300D;</span></p><p><span style="">When he heard the intercom, Minchan brushed his messy hair with his hand.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Tell her to come in.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Ddal-kahk.</span></p><p><span style="">The door opened, and Bibi took short and quick steps to enter the Prime Minister&#x2019;s office. &#xA0;She wasn&#x2019;t alone.</span></p><p><span style="">Kahng-woojin&#x2019;s dongsaeng Sooah followed Bibi everywhere as if they were close friends. &#xA0;Then there was Do-jaemin, who acted as their bodyguard.</span></p><p><span style="">Woo-soonghoon followed in behind them.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Mmm. &#xA0;What can i do for you?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Bibi let out a small smile as she asked him a question.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;We are going to Beijing?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes. &#xA0;We will work together with the Chinese government, and we&#x2019;ll take care of the Colony.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;We aren&#x2019;t going there.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;That Colony was formed by one of the great lords of Trahnet. &#xA0;The risk is too high.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;However, we already promised them our help. &#xA0;If Alandal doesn&#x2019;t step forward, we won&#x2019;t be able to avoid an international disaster.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Everyone was making a big fuss, because Alandal had been conservative in their actions in recent days. &#xA0;If they didn&#x2019;t step forward this time around, Alandal&#x2019;s renown as the country, who protects earth, would crumble away in a single day.</span></p><p><span style="">However, Bibi felt differently in regards to Minchan&#x2019;s worries. &#xA0;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">She was resolute. </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Rejected.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Do-jaemin spoke up to give an additional explanation.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Prime Minister Jung. &#xA0;I also think we shouldn&#x2019;t go there. &#xA0;It is too dangerous.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ha-ah.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Do-jaemin had returned early from Alphen.</span></p><p><span style="">He didn&apos;t know what Do-jaemin experienced in Alphen, but he back as a very cautious youth. &#xA0;He turned down doing anything dangerous, and he only stayed next to Kahng-sooah at all times.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;This is a problem where the existence of Alandal is on the line. &#xA0;We can&#x2019;t always avoid the problems.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">At Jung-minchan&#x2019;s serious words, Bibi playfully shook her head from side to side.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ah ah. &#xA0;I don&apos;t care. &#xA0;I&apos;m more interested in listening to my master rather than guarding earth.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;But&#x2026;.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Woo-soonghoon tried to console Minchan, who had a complicated expression on his face.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Prime Minister. &#xA0;We shouldn&#x2019;t lose sight of our original intention..&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Huh?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What was the reason for establishing the country of Alandal?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Well, it was for world peace and the defense of earth&#x2026;.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Eh-ee. &#xA0;That&apos;s just what other people guessed our mission was.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Minchan furrowed his brows. &#xA0;Too many events had occurred, so it felt like he was dredging up an old memory. &#xA0;He remembered what was said by Kahng-woojin.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I want to be exempt from joining the military, and I want to clear the Dungeons in peace.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">It was as if he could hear Woojin&apos;s voice. &#xA0;In the first place, Alandal hadn&#x2019;t been founded with some big goal in mind. &#xA0;They existed solely for caring for Kahng-woojin. &#xA0;They were founded to take care of all the miscellaneous work.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Huh huh.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Minchan let out a hearty laugh. &#xA0;The thoughts that had complicated and stressed him out lessened a little bit.</span></p>
