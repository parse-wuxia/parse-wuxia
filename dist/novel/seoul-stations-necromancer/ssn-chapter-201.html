<p>Chapter 201 - God of Destruction (1)</p><p><span style="">Woojin exited the room with a big frown on his face, and the first thing he saw was a crowd of people running up to him.</span></p><p><span style="">There was Jung-minchan, and Woo-sooghoon. &#xA0;Then there was Kim-haemin and Blanka, who he hadn&#x2019;t seen for awhile. &#xA0;Even Bibi was there&#x2026;.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Why are you all gathering around me?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Are you ok? &#xA0;The sounds from inside the...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I want you to heal the bastard inside.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Blanka possessed a Healing ability, so he discreetly went into the isolation room. &#xA0;The rest of the group followed behind Woojin.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Why are you guys following me like dogs?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Mmmm. &#xA0;. Are you ok, president?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Jung-minchan bolstered his courage as he asked a question. &#xA0;Woojin frowned as he replied with a question of his own.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Why wouldn&#x2019;t I be fine?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Your complexion doesn&#x2019;t look good.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Woojin looked around his surrounding.</span></p><p><span style="">Everyone looked worried, and there was something common in all their faces. &#xA0;They were all looking at him with worried eyes.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Are you guys perhaps worried about me?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Huh. &#xA0;Jeez.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin grinned. &#xA0;He relaxed his stiffened face.</span></p><p><span style="">He never expected to receive such gazes from others in this life.</span></p><p><span style="">No, there had always been someone, who had looked at him with such worried eyes.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;This is a first aside from my mother.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">Maybe, this should have been obvious if he looked back on it.</span></p><p><span style="">These people already deserved to be called his family.</span></p><p><span style="">He could worry about them independent from what power they possessed.</span></p><p><span style="">It was a refreshing feeling. &#xA0;He had decided to protect them all, but he didn&#x2019;t realize they were worrying about him.</span></p><p><span style="">He didn&#x2019;t hate the feeling.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Are you all frustrated?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes? &#xA0;Yes, sir!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Jung-minchan&#x2019;s voice was especially overflowing with energy.</span></p><p><span style="">Of course, everyone felt frustrated by the situation, but it was the worst for Jung-michan.</span></p><p><span style="">Important figures from different countries contacted Minchan so much that these calls just rolled off his back. &#xA0;He shrugged them off, yet kings and government officials kept trying to get Minchan to arrange Kahng-woojin&#x2019;s support.</span></p><p><span style="">It wasn&#x2019;t just these people. &#xA0;All the people of the world held a similar view. &#xA0;Kahng-woojin was the vanguard spearheading the Dungeon Breaks and the Monster Rush. &#xA0;This was why everyone surmised Kahng-woojin had the most information regarding what was going on.</span></p><p><span style="">In truth, Jung-minchan also thought the same. &#xA0;However, even if he did receive answers from Woojin, Minchan wouldn&#x2019;t never pass on what he learned to others.</span></p><p><span style="">His role was to take the requests and criticisms. &#xA0;He stopped the threats and entreaties for cooperation from reaching Kahng-woojin by solving issues beforehand. &#xA0;He made it easier for Kahng-woojin to operate.</span></p><p><span style="">However, Minchan was staring at an endless war with the monsters. &#xA0;Of course, he was curious to know if this war would come to an end. </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Gather around.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin&#x2019;s expression softened a bit, and this served to relax the uncomfortable atmosphere.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Mmm. &#xA0;How should I explain this&#x2026;.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Hadn&#x2019;t he been angry, because he couldn&#x2019;t organize this situation within his head?</span></p><p><span style="">However, everyone was waiting with bright eyes as they waited for his answer. &#xA0;He did his best to summarize the situation.</span></p><p><span style="">The act of trying to explain it to someone else made it easier for him to sort everything out.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;It is year 2529 on the real earth. &#xA0;This world was a world created in virtual reality.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Everyone became surprised.</span></p><p><span style="">Soonghoon&#x2019;s eyes turned round as he asked a question.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;So what are we?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;We are people connected to this reality. &#xA0;Maybe some of us are fakes..&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin&#x2019;s words lingered, and everyone kept looking at each other. &#xA0;It seemed they couldn&#x2019;t comprehend his words, so they kept repeating Woojin&#x2019;s words inside their heads.</span></p><p><span style="">It seemed Woojin wasn&#x2019;t going to wait for them to comprehend it. &#xA0;He continued to pour out the words he organized.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;There are 72 of these fake worlds. &#xA0;Earth is one of them. &#xA0;Alphen is another. &#xA0;The Planet Jaku was also&#x2026;..&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;T...then what are Dimensional lords? &#xA0;What are Dimensional Domains, and the Dungeons&#x2026;.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;It is the crack between Dimensions. &#xA0;It might be a small planet, and the owners are the Dimensional lords. &#xA0;They are probably connecting to this place from the real earth. &#xA0;They are probably humans barely hanging onto life through a life-support machine. &#xA0;&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">His words were so serious that it felt like a joke. &#xA0;They felt an instinctual need to deny Woojin&#x2019;s words, but they felt a sinking feeling in their stomach.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;So the Roused are the humans, who are accessing this place? &#xA0;The others are virtual humans&#x2026;. &#xA0;Are you saying we are NPCs?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Minchan&#x2019;s voice was shaking unusually hard as he asked the question. &#xA0;Woojin shrugged his shoulders nonchalantly.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I have no idea.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">He wasn&#x2019;t qualified to determine if it was true or not. &#xA0;However, it wasn&#x2019;t as if he trusted 100% of Dr. Toppler&#x2019;s story.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;That&#x2019;s just what I heard. &#xA0;Well&#x2026; Do you feel like a fake?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Minchan blanched as he shook his head from side to side.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Not at all&#xFF01;&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin grinned.</span></p><p><span style="">The people here thought, took actions and lived their lives. &#xA0;How could they be defined by aggregation of 1s and 0s?</span></p><p><span style="">He wouldn&#x2019;t define these people here as fake. &#xA0;He would instead define the program or beings, who created these people, to be gods.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;If you heard it from someone&#x2026;. &#xA0;Who did you hear it from?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Professor Toppler.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;You met him?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;He did as he pleased. &#xA0;He opened a gate to come to me. &#xA0;He said he&#x2019;s a human from year 2529. &#xA0;He said he&#x2019;s from the real earth.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Minchan couldn&#x2019;t help it. &#xA0;He asked a question about the preposterous story.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;&#x2026;so is it possible to correspond with them?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I have no idea.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Huhk.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Should he be called irresponsible? &#xA0;Maybe he was just thoughtless? &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin had spoken about a story that was hard to accept, yet he was acting unperturbed.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;That is why&#x2026;.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">He grinned as he looked at each one of them. </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I&#x2019;m going to go and confirm it.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Minchan wondered if he should try to stop Woojin, but he couldn&#x2019;t bring himself to speak. &#xA0;He was in a state of confusion.</span></p><p><span style="">This world was fake&#x2026; &#xA0;There was a chance that he wasn&#x2019;t a human&#x2026;.</span></p><p><span style="">The other countries were asking for support, and Japan had come out against them. &#xA0;However, those events didn&#x2019;t seem important anymore. &#xA0;Even the monsters from the Dungeon Break felt insignificant compared to this.</span></p><p><span style="">Toppler had said everything here was fake&#x2026;.</span></p><p><span style="">He thought maybe the most important task he could do was to check the veracity of this claim.</span></p><p><span style="">Woo-soonghoon, who had been still as he listened, suddenly asked a question.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Do you trust his words, king&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I don&#x2019;t know.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Mmm. &#xA0;What if this is some big ruse? &#xA0;I&#x2019;ve hatched a lot of them before, and this smells a bit fishy.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">He grinned as he replied to his words.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;If it is a ruse, I&#x2019;ll just beat him to death.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ha ha&#x2026;.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Soonghoon had duped Woojin into buying a particular handphone, and he had been beaten like a drum. &#xA0;He put on an awkward smile as remembered the past.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;It is worth checking out.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What if it turns out to be true?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Well, what do you think I&#x2019;ll do?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">When Woojin put on a weird smile, Soonghoon gulped.</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin looked at the needlessly nervous people, and he brought up a topic he had been holding back.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;While I&#x2019;m gone, you guys have to do something for me.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What do you want of us?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I want you all to protect Sooah.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Of course, we will.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The protection of Kahng-woojin&#x2019;s family was their first priority. &#xA0;At Jung-minchan&#x2019;s untroubled answer, Woojin spoke to him in a serious manner.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;You have to protect Sooah even if you lose everything.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Woojin&#x2019;s gaze head towards Bibi.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Do you understand?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes, master.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">If Sooah was a proxy of earth&#x2019;s god&#x2026;. &#xA0;There will be an relentless push by the Dimensional lords to gain the Code.</span></p><p><span style="">He couldn&#x2019;t hand them over the Code, and he couldn&#x2019;t lose Sooah either.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;When everyone gets back, I want you to deliver my words to them.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes, sir.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Do-jaemin was still continuing his Dimensional Battles, and he was steadily increasing the stockpile of Points.</span></p><p><span style="">There was no news regarding Sunggoo, and Haesol had left after leaving behind a letter. &#xA0;She was somewhere on Alphen, and no one knew when she would be returning.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Where are you going to go, president?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Before I go, I have someone I have to meet.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">The Moon World bastards would facilitate his logout? &#xA0;He had been summoned before against his will before. &#xA0;Once was enough. &#xA0;If he had business on the earth from year 2529, he would go there of his own volition.</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin summoned his Phantom Steed, and he got on.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Bibi.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes, master.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;If I don&#x2019;t make it back&#x2026; &#xA0;I leave the Undead army to you.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">When the Undead familiars were summoned, the magical energy of the Necromancer started to be consumed. &#xA0;This was especially true for Yong Yong. &#xA0;It had an enormous body, and it always received considerable damage during battle. &#xA0;One had to regenerate it, and it siphoned off a significant amount of magical energy.</span></p><p><span style="">This was also the reason why the Undead army had a hard time operating far from its king.</span></p><p><span style="">Occasionally, he had given command of his Undead army to Lich Jaenis. &#xA0;It was also inevitable that Jaenis had a smaller reservoir of magical energy compared to Woojin, since it couldn&#x2019;t steal souls.</span></p><p><span style="">However, he had already assigned Bibi as the admin in charge of taking care of the Flying Fortress.</span></p><p><span style="">It was similar to how Woojin gathered the souls nearby to fuel his magical energy. &#xA0;Bibi would be able to use the Colony&#x2019;s Points to bolster her magical energy. &#xA0;Of course, this was assuming she was near the Colony.</span></p><p><span style="">If Bibi was able to give them support, the Undead army would be able to display its full power.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;It won&#x2019;t take me too long to check this out. &#xA0;I want you to protect Sooah.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes, master.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Please don&#x2019;t worry.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;We&#x2019;ll protect her at all cost.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The Phantom Steed jumped into the air, and everyone waved their hands towards Woojin.</span></p><p><span style="">The several people, who was aware of situation surrounding the Holy Maiden of earth, started their defense against the beings gunning for her.</span></p><p><span style="">Poo-shoohk.</span></p><p><span style="">Toppler, who had been connected through the interface adapter, opened his eyes after his Code was withdrawn.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Mmm.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">When he groaned, one of the team member pushed a bottle towards him.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Thank you.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Were you successful in convincing him?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hmmm. &#xA0;I&#x2019;m not sure.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">He became surprised at the professor&#x2019;s wishy washy answer.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;If we don&#x2019;t have the Code, how are we going to restore the planet?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Mmm.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">They needed two things to reset the virtual servers.</span></p><p><span style="">They needed the Restoration Code and the Planet Code.</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin possessed the Deletion Code, and he gained the Restoration Code by killing Iello. &#xA0;However, that was all he possessed.</span></p><p><span style="">Only the 72 Thrones possessed the Planet Codes.</span></p><p><span style="">Dr. Toppler&#x2019;s job was to convince Kahng-woojin to acquire the Earth&#x2019;s Code, and it would make him the 1st Throne.</span></p><p><span style="">This was the only way he&#x2019;ll become useful after his logout.</span></p><p><span style="">If he didn&#x2019;t have the Planet Code, it didn&#x2019;t matter if he had the Deletion Code and the Recovery Code. &#xA0;It was like asking someone to cook with a knife and pan with no ingredients.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Shouldn&#x2019;t we halt everything right now? &#xA0;What if our actions instigate the god of destruction to descend&#x2026;.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">They had gone through hardship to hold out for this long, yet it could all disappear in a flash. &#xA0;This was why they hadn&#x2019;t approached Kahng-woojin, who had the Deletion Code, in the first place. &#xA0;He was too difficult to deal with. Their hopes had been with Iello&#x2026;.</span></p><p><span style="">Toppler let out a bitter laugh when the person in front of him looked at Toppler with distrustful eyes. &#xA0;He couldn&#x2019;t blame the man. &#xA0;He deserved to be berated, since he had acted without seeking approval from the others. &#xA0;He wanted to put all the blame and consequences squarely on his shoulders, but events had gotten too out of hand to do so.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I&#x2019;ll have to give orders to Kim-kahngchul.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I&#x2019;ll make preparations.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">They had to prepare for the unexpected. &#xA0;If Kahng-woojin logged out without possessing the Planet Code, it would be the worst possible scenario. &#xA0;They had to prepare for it.</span></p><p><span style="">Hweeeee.</span></p><p><span style="">It was a desert where only sand was carried by the wind. &#xA0;One could see a dried up tree, and two abandoned buildings. &#xA0;After stopping his Phantom Steed, Woojin jumped off as he looked at his surrounding.</span></p><p><span style="">He looked in all directions, and all he could see was sand. &#xA0;There was no sign of life here, yet he was careful.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ggaebi.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">[Koo-koohk. &#xA0;Did you call for me?]</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Check if anyone is nearby.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">[Do you need a sacrifice? &#xA0;Or maybe you need blood?]</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Stop talking nonsense. &#xA0;Just go and search.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">[Koo koo. &#xA0;I will carry out your order.]</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin frowned as Ggaebi spoke with great mirth.</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin had sought out a location with no people nearby. &#xA0;He wanted to minimize the loss of life.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Shall I start now?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin took out the Sealed Stone, Return Marble and the Summon Stone. &#xA0;He had bought them from his Achievement Store.</span></p><p><span style="">After surviving in Alphen for the past 20 years, he had been barely able to find this method. &#xA0;It allowed him to return home.</span></p><p><span style="">He gathered the three Items in one place, and he smashed them.</span></p><p><span style="">Pah-ah-ah-ah.</span></p><p><span style="">The Items turned into dust, and it scattered as if it was smoke. &#xA0;Soon, it coalesced in front of Woojin&#x2019;s eyes as it let out a light.</span></p><p><span style="">Hooooohng!</span></p><p><span style="">It was a mass made out of light.</span></p><p><span style="">The mass of light was wearing armor, and it was able to speak even though it didn&#x2019;t have a mouth.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;</span><span style="">You are a warrior that has reached the pinnacle</span><span style="">&#x2026;. &#xA0;Where do you want to go?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The tail end of his mouth lifted when he heard the same word from this being.</span></p><p><span style="">Seventy Second Throne.</span></p><p><span style="">He possessed all the Planet Codes&#x2026;. &#xA0;He was the closest to being the absolute being.</span></p><p><span style="">He spoke towards the Dimensional Admin.</span></p>
