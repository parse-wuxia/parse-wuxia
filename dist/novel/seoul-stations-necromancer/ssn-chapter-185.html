<p>Chapter 185 - Last Holy Item (1)</p><p><span style="">God of Time Heres.</span></p><p><span style="">The god was reported to have been born alongside Alphen, but he didn&apos;t have many followers. &#xA0;No, the existence of the god hadn&apos;t been spread, so the normal people didn&apos;t even know about his existence.</span></p><p><span style="">Only his priests worshipped Heres, and their missions were conducted in secret. They secretly traveled across the continent, and they only opened their doors to their successors.</span></p><p><span style="">Scholars and the long-lived races were the only ones, who knew about the existence of Heres.</span></p><p><span style="">The exclusive and secret order of the god was located on a land covered with ice.</span></p><p><span style="">Too too too too.</span></p><p><span style="">A Phantom Steed was running above this land.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Ha-ah.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">A white plume of breath came out of Latasha&apos;s mouth.</span></p><p><span style="">The Elf Lord was once again co-opted as a guide, because she knew the location of Heres&apos; temple, and she had good eyesight.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Are you sure we are on the right path?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Yes, I&apos;m sure.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I don&apos;t see anything here.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin tilted his head in puzzlement, yet Shing Shing didn&apos;t stop running.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;It is located at the land of ice. &#xA0;Heres&apos; temple is located at the deepest and coldest location.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Where is that suppose to be?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;We can see it now.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin&apos;s eyes lit up when he looked at the location pointed out by Latasha. &#xA0;One could see an enormous ice mountain towering over this flat lands.</span></p><p><span style="">As they got closer, his eyes kept getting larger.</span></p><p><span style="">It wasn&apos;t a mountain.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Ice Castle?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Yes. &#xA0;You are correct.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">The Ice Castle was placed in a location where the cold made it impossible for any creature to live here. &#xA0;However, the enormous castle was as big as the Saurus mountain.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Huh.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">This was beyond it being grand. &#xA0;Its overwhelming size gave even Woojin a pause. &#xA0;It was the same for Latasha.</span></p><p><span style="">The information about this place was passed down through oral tradition, and this was the first time she was seeing this place.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Well, let&apos;s head in.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">They circled the castle once, and they were able to find an entrance halfway up the castle. &#xA0;When the Phantom Steed approached it, one could see a very small door big enough to allow only a single person to enter.</span></p><p><span style="">Kwahng kwahng!</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I think it is locked.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Latasha knocked on the door then she turned to looked at Woojin. &#xA0;He stepped forward.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Move aside.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">He saw no doorknob or keyhole. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">Moreover, when he &#xA0;put his palm to the door, he could feel the coldness through the door.</span></p><p><span style="">Weeeeeng.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;W...wait a moment...&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">When she felt the nearby magical energy move, Latasha tried to stop him. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin gathered his power into his palm, and he detonated the door.</span></p><p><span style="">Ggoo-ahng!</span></p><p><span style="">Accompanying a shock wave, the door flew inward.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;It&apos;s open.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Why are you so rude?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Did you want me to knock and wait for someone to come to the door?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;...&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">She didn&apos;t know why she bothered with words.</span></p><p><span style="">The Immortal wasn&apos;t a good candidate for her to lecture about manners and etiquette. &#xA0;Latasha&apos;s cheeks puffed out as she turned her head away.</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin ignored her, and he started climbing the long staircase made out of ice.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Why is it so dark in here?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Please wait.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Latasha elegantly waved her hands before cupping her hands together.</span></p><p><span style="">Pah-paht.</span></p><p><span style="">A small fairy made out of light appeared atop her palms. &#xA0;It gave a bright smile before it flew in front of the party.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;It is a Spirit of Light.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I didn&apos;t ask for one.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Uh-whew...&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Latasha shook her head from side to side as she walked in front of him. &#xA0;They climbed long enough that they were starting to get bored. &#xA0;At the end of the stairway, a door appeared.</span></p><p><span style="">Unlike the one before, this steel door had a deeply recessed handhold. &#xA0;Latasha pulled with all her might, yet it refused to open.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Are you going to blow it up again?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Of course.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Weeeng.</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin placed his palm on the door, and he gathered his magical energy. &#xA0;However, the door opened before the explosion could occur.</span></p><p><span style="">Chweeek, weeeeng!</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;....&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">After looking at the opened crack, Latasha looked towards the Immortal.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;What should we do? &#xA0;Should we not go in?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;We&apos;ll go in.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Eeeng, chweeek!</span></p><p><span style="">When they went in, the door locked itself.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;....&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin frowned, and Latasha was taken aback.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;W...what the hell happened? &#xA0;I can&apos;t hear the voice of the wind.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">The temple severed the inhabitants from the outside. &#xA0;It seemed the Immortal wasn&apos;t the only one, who had his power taken away.</span></p><p><span style="">Latasha also lost her power, and she floundered at this alien feeling.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;L...let&apos;s go back out. &#xA0;This is too dangerous.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">In an unexpected turn of event, an unknown power had made her lose her power. &#xA0;The pitfall of such a situation made her feel agitated. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;It&apos;s all right. &#xA0;It is always like this. &#xA0;We&apos;ll leave after we find the Holy Item.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;But...&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Latasha frowned. However, she inferred from the Immortal&apos;s expression that this was normal.</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin walked as if he was used to such a situation.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;It isn&apos;t shaped like a spaceship...&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">The light attached to the ceiling reminded him of the ones at the Aria&apos;s Temple.</span></p><p><span style="">He didn&apos;t have to see Skia, Lecia, and Coor&apos;s temples to know what was in it. &#xA0;Still, he wonder why these 5 gods held the Master Codes of Alphen....</span></p><p><span style="">As they walked down the long corridor, they came to an intersection. &#xA0;The space partitioned into sections, and they arrived at doors as they followed the walls. &#xA0;However, none of them were open.</span></p><p><span style="">Toong, toong!</span></p><p><span style="">He tried punching the door, but he knew it wouldn&apos;t be easy to break through the doors.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;S...shall we continue forward? &#xA0;Since we came in without consent, maybe the god Heres is mad at us?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I have no idea.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Maybe, it was the absence of her power, but she was unusually chatty right now. &#xA0;She continued to speak as they searched the place.</span></p><p><span style="">A high priest must exist somewhere, so they continued the hide &amp; seek.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Jeez.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">If he had his abilities... &#xA0;He would have used Ggaebi to scout the surrounding. &#xA0;It was very unfortunate that this option wasn&apos;t available to him.</span></p><p><span style="">He walked through the long corridors, while he drew a map inside his mind. &#xA0;While he was searching, he came upon a door with a different looking door handle. &#xA0;He tried opening it.</span></p><p><span style="">Poo-shook.</span></p><p><span style="">He only put a small amount of pressure on it, yet the door opened automatically. &#xA0;The sight across the door was familiar to Woojin, but it was foreign to Latasha.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;A pool table and a refrigerator...&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">It was a pretty large room, and at a glance, one could tell it was being used as a break room. &#xA0;Woojin opened the refrigerator, and he saw the familiar sight of a cola.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;This is...&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Kahng, cheeek.</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin opened the can, and he started drinking the soda. &#xA0;Latasha was taken aback.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;W...what if it is poisoned...&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;You should try drinking it.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">He unexpectedly threw another can of coke towards Latasha. &#xA0;She caught it, and she looked over it in confusion.</span></p><p><span style="">Tik, tik.</span></p><p><span style="">She didn&apos;t know how to open it, so she struggled to open the drink. &#xA0;He smirked at the sight, then he looked at his surrounding.</span></p><p><span style="">He saw a sofa and a tv. &#xA0;Beyond the screen, he could see a locker room. &#xA0;He saw familiar letters on each locker. &#xA0;Woojin looked at it with narrowed eyes.</span></p><p><span style="">He could read some characters.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Saurie, Iello, Gahng, Natamube....&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">There were around 8 lockers, and the letters looked similar to english, but he wasn&apos;t sure if it was the same language. &#xA0;He wasn&apos;t sure if he was reading it right.</span></p><p><span style="">If this was a spaceship, it would have had a crew. &#xA0;If this was a building, it would have had custodians.</span></p><p><span style="">He opened all the lockers, but it was all empty.</span></p><p><span style="">He looked through the items within the break room, and he was sure of one thing.</span></p><p><span style="">&apos;There&apos;s a connection here with earth.&apos;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin had finished searching the room, and he was about to move on when Latasha was successful in opening the can.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Wow.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">She looked at it with a face filled with curiosity. &#xA0;She took two gulps before she sprayed the liquid into the air.</span></p><p><span style="">Poo-ooh-ooh.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Ooh-ook! &#xA0;As expected, it&apos;s poison!&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">She felt her throat being tickled as the carbonation of the drink attacked her. &#xA0;Latasha grabbed her white neck as she rolled around on the floor. &#xA0;When she felt a pressure rising from her stomach, she gave into it by opening her mouth.</span></p><p><span style="">Burrrrrp.</span></p><p><span style="">She had been rolling on the floor, but now she lay perfectly still. &#xA0;She was surprised as she stared at the ceiling. &#xA0;Woojin let out a sigh.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Stop playing around. &#xA0;Let&apos;s go.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;....&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;What&apos;re you doing?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Her face was bright red from embarrassment, but at the same time, her eyes widened.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;There is movement over there!&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Huh?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">He looked towards where Latasha was pointing at. &#xA0;He saw a small camera installed on the ceiling near the kitchen.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Ho-oh.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">It seemed someone was here.</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin approached the lens of the camera, and he had a wide grin on his face.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Since you&apos;ve invited me, should we talk face to face?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">To be precise, he hadn&apos;t been invited. &#xA0;However, Woojin sent a warning towards the unfriendly owner of the temple.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I saw some tools over there. &#xA0;If you don&apos;t come out now, I&apos;ll destroy everything.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">He gave the camera a wink, and he headed towards the bags containing tools.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;What are you doing? &#xA0;You should carry one too.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Yes.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin took out a long claw hammer, and he passed the bag to Latasha..</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Ughh.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">The bag was quite heavy. &#xA0;She was a woman, yet she wasn&apos;t laboring under the weight.</span></p><p><span style="">Her magical energy had disappeared, but it seemed her strength as an Elf Lord remained.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Well, shall we start now?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">If all the doors were locked, he&apos;ll force it open.</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin exited the breakroom to force open the locked doors.</span></p><p><span style="">This was when a light turned on in the corridor.</span></p><p><span style="">To be precise, a guiding light in the shape of an arrow appeared on the floor.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Ho-oh. &#xA0;You should have done this in the first place.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin and Latasha walked through the maze-like corridors as they were guided by the arrow. &#xA0;Afterwards, they arrived at a pretty large hallway.</span></p><p><span style="">Chweek.</span></p><p><span style="">A door opened from both sides, and they entered a small room.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;T...the ground is shaking.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;It is called an elevator.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;....&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">As if taken aback, Latasha grasped at the guardrails. &#xA0;This sight amused Woojin.</span></p><p><span style="">Weeeeng.</span></p><p><span style="">When the door opened once again, they came out to a large hall.</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin walked forward with a long claw hammer that was as long as a baseball bat.</span></p><p><span style="">He could see numerous computer screens placed everywhere.</span></p><p><span style="">Even at a glance, one could see a screen that was placed at the head, and the screen was on.</span></p><p><span style="">A bald man was standing inside the screen with a subdued smile on his face.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;What should we do? &#xA0;I think he is trapped inside.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;You should go stand over there..&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Yes...&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin distanced himself from Latasha, who was making a big fuss. &#xA0;Then he addressed the screen.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Heres?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">[Yes.]</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;No, should I be referring to you as one of the crew members?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">[...both aren&apos;t really suitable. &#xA0;If you are asking about why there&apos;s no one here, they didn&apos;t exist in the first place.]</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I don&apos;t plan on humoring your riddles. &#xA0;Just give me your belt.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">[Hmm. &#xA0;You should have a lot of questions. &#xA0;Aren&apos;t you going to ask me about it?]</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Do you plan on answering it?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">[Of course.]</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Does the ancient civilization of Alphen have any connection with earth?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">[I only record. &#xA0;I don&apos;t have the authority to browse the records.]</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;You....&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Ha. &#xA0;Nothing would come from his cussing at it.</span></p><p><span style="">Rather than wasting his effort with words, it would be better to ignore it. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">Well, even if he hadn&apos;t asked about it, he wasn&apos;t too interested on finding those answers.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Give me &#xA0;your belt.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">[I can give it to you, but it isn&apos;t time.]</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;What nonsense are you talking about?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">[I&apos;ll give it to you when it is time.]</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I&apos;m asking what time?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">[....]</span></p><p><span style="">The bald man inside the screen didn&apos;t answer him, so Woojin started to swear.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Do you want to die?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">[If you want to terminate my system, it isn&apos;t possible. &#xA0;You won&apos;t be able to get close to my physical server.]</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;....&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin had a big frown on his face.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Server? &#xA0;What are your goals as gods?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">[We want to maintain and protect Alphen. &#xA0;That is all.]</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Uh-whew.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin shook his head from side to side. &#xA0;He never expected to find a god that was harder to talk to than Aria.</span></p><p><span style="">So basically the gods were like a firewall protecting and preserving this planet.</span></p><p><span style="">However, the gods always spoke in obscure ways, and this one in particular was speaking in stiff tones that made Woojin&apos;s blood boil.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;If you won&apos;t give it to me, I&apos;ll find it for myself.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">[You won&apos;t be able to find...]</span></p><p><span style="">Kwah-jeek!</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin took the sharp end of the claw hammer to the screen.</span></p><p><span style="">Pi-jee-jeek.</span></p><p><span style="">The screen let out a spark, and the screen next to it turned on.</span></p><p><span style="">[You won&apos;t be able to find it.]</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Ha.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin once again smashed the lit screen, and another screen turned on again.</span></p><p><span style="">[Please be ready. &#xA0;When the time come, I&apos;ll give you the &apos;key&apos;.]</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I told you I&apos;ll find it!&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Kwah-jeek!</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin kept destroying the screens, and Latasha stared at Woojin from the corner with wide eyes.</span></p><p><span style="">In all her memories, she had never seen the Immortal in such an excited state.</span></p><p><span style="">***</span></p><p><span style="">Saurus Mountain&apos;s World Tree.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;You rascals! &#xA0;If you cook meat here, you&apos;ll be punished!&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Ooh-ahk. &#xA0;It&apos;s the soldiers.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Che-haesol and the Phantom Unit arrived in front of the unquenchable fire. &#xA0;It was called the Fire Spirit King&apos;s Last Breath. The children, who had been playing around the fire, scattered into the surrounding as they laughed.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Uh-whew. &#xA0;I wonder when our director will be back.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">After crossing over to Alphen, they hadn&apos;t spent much time with Woojin. &#xA0;Moreover, Do-jaemin had already returned to earth, and Sunggoo had disappeared into this single flame.</span></p><p><span style="">Weeeeng.</span></p><p><span style="">The portal vibrated as it let out a subdued light. &#xA0;It was right in front of them, yet they weren&apos;t able to cross it.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Who is it! &#xA0;Uh? &#xA0;Holy Maiden.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Haesol smiled as she watched Melody slowly walk towards the World Tree. &#xA0;Whether it was on earth or Alphen, her miraculous healing ability was an awesome power. &#xA0;Everyone in the Coalition liked her.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I came here, because I would like to have a conversation with the World Tree.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;What? &#xA0;Ah... &#xA0;Well, please go ahead.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">The World Tree was only a symbol representing the Colony to Haesol, but the World Tree held a special significance to the people of Alphen.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Could you leave me alone with the tree for a brief moment?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Mmmm. &#xA0;All right.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Haesol and the Phantom Unit eyed Melody as they distanced themselves from the World Tree.</span></p><p><span style="">When the Holy Maiden was the only one left in front of the World Tree, she looked up at it with a heavy heart.</span></p>
