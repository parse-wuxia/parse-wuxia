<p>Chapter 196 - Trahnet (1)</p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Won&#x2019;t it be dangerous?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;That is why I&#x2019;m going to preemptively get rid of them.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">He had to protect Sooah. &#xA0;If he wanted to do that, he had to eliminate his enemies. &#xA0;&#xA0;Kahng-woojin made up his mind.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Let&#x2019;s go to Seoul.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Understood.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Minchan gave his assent, and the course was set.</span></p><p><span style="">Koo-ooh-oohng.</span></p><p><span style="">Bibi&#x2019;s castle tilted before it righted itself.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I guess they are back.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">It was an impact that shook the large fortress. &#xA0;This could only mean that Yong Yong had landed on the flying fortress.</span></p><p><span style="">When Woojin came out to the deck, he was greeted by his Undead army. &#xA0;They had returned after defeating the Dimensional lords trying to form Colonies in Taiwan.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Master&#xFF01;&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Get ready, Bibi. &#xA0;We are going to go catch Iello.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Oh-ho. &#xA0;He&#x2019;s a great lord..&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Even amongst the Dimensional lords, the 72 great lords were powerful beings. &#xA0;Bibi brought up the information regarding Iello, and she furrowed her brows.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;He&#x2019;s a troublesome one.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Lee-sahngho glommed onto that batard. &#xA0;We have to eliminate them before they become a bigger problem.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Lee-sahngho had died once, so he had lost the Code to earth. &#xA0;He was basically a Dimensional refugee now.</span></p><p><span style="">The only thing going for him was the fact that he was the ex-guild master of the Hwarang guild. &#xA0;This was why he had a high profile amongst the people of earth, and he had stepped forward to endorse Iello.</span></p><p><span style="">In such chaotic times, how would the people of earth react to a friendly Dimensional lord?</span></p><p><span style="">Moreover, the fact that Lee-sahngho was helping Iello by his side would lower the hostility of the people by a significant amount.</span></p><p><span style="">Moreover, the existence of Kahng-woojin also worked in the favor of Iello.</span></p><p><span style="">He commanded the Undead army.</span></p><p><span style="">Kahng-woojin&#x2019;s subordinates were basically monsters to the people of earth, but the only reason why they were accepted was the fact that a person from earth was the leader. &#xA0;He had control over his subordinates, and he was able to use them to fight against the monsters considered to be enemies.</span></p><p><span style="">If Iello was aiming for a similar role&#x2026;.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;It&#x2019;ll be troublesome.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">If the people, who already made a pact with Iello, got in Woojin&#x2019;s way&#x2026;.</span></p><p><span style="">He might have to war against a bloc of humans, who had the support of a Dimensional lord.</span></p><p><span style="">Still, the situation wasn&#x2019;t all too bad.</span></p><p><span style="">The Undead army had raised a significant amount of Achievement Points through their diligent hunting. &#xA0;Moreover, he also gained a good amount of Points through the Dimensional Battles.</span></p><p><span style="">He used both his Achievement Store and Dimensional Store to purchase the Ingredient Items needed to forge the Thrash&#x2019;s Set.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I was barely able to make one more.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin put on the black gloves.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x3008;Thrash&#x2019;s Punishment&#x3009;</span></p><p><span style="">The god of Fertility Lecia&#x2019;s treasure was now imbued with the power of the god of Destruction.</span></p><p><span style="">The Holy Item had the power to sprout any seed, but now it had changed into an Item of calamity. &#xA0;It allowed Woojin to extract souls from all beings.</span></p><p><span style="">Now he just needed the helm for his defensive set Item.</span></p><p><span style="">However, he had already regained four of his equipments, so he felt his confidence buoy.</span></p><p><span style="">Jaemin was doing very good work as he continued to fight the Dimensional Battles, and soon he&#x2019;ll be able to equip all his gears.</span></p><p><span style="">He will have gathered the five keys that&#x2019;ll allow him to gain the Executioner.</span></p><p><span style="">It wouldn&apos;t be too long before Thrash&#x2019;s power descended upon him.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I&#x2019;ll be back before we arrive at our destination, so wait for my return.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes, master.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;If something happens, contact me.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I will&#xFF01;&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin ruffled Bibi&#x2019;s head once, and he used his portal to head towards his Dimensional Domain.</span></p><p><span style="">He had to use every minute and every second to gather Points. &#xA0;He might be able to gain the last set Item called Thrash&#x2019;s Glory before he arrived at his destination.</span></p><p><span style=""> *** &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">Bam island, Hahn River.</span></p><p><span style="">The Thorn Tree had grown atop the island, and ice covered the entire tree. &#xA0;A palace made out of ice was built atop the tree like a bird&#x2019;s nest. &#xA0;Iello was within and he was incensed.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Shit!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;&#x2026;&#x2026;.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">His anger made the palace shake, and Lee-sahngho was prostrated on the floor as he waited for Iello&#x2019;s anger to subside.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Kahng-woojin is coming here?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes. &#xA0;However, I don&#x2019;t think he&#x2019;ll be able attack us without cause.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Why?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;The official statement has not been released yet, but we&#x2019;ve finalized the defense treaty with Japan. &#xA0;This will greatly limit his options.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">It hadn&#x2019;t be announced yet, but Iello and Japan had already finalized the defense treaty.</span></p><p><span style="">Japan had always been jealous of Korea for being allied to the newly formed country of Alandal. &#xA0;This was why it had been unexpectedly easy to achieve alliance with Japan.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;We are also hearing favorable words from Korea, so we just need to wait a little bit more.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Kahng-woojin&#x2019;s Alandal was impossible to control, so there were some within the Korea government, who looked favorably at the appearance of Iello. &#xA0;Lee-sahngho was saying all the right words to the leading members of the Korean government.</span></p><p><span style="">However, there was a problem. &#xA0;He had put in a lot of work to bring all of this about, but it had no effect in easing the rage of Iello.</span></p><p><span style="">The source of the problem was Kahng-woojin.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Do you really think that bastard will think in those terms?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;That&#x2019;s&#x2026;.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Lee-sahngho had been mercilessly assaulted by Kahng-woojin when all the cameras were on him. &#xA0;&#xA0;Kahng-woojin was the worst type of terrorist, and he didn&#x2019;t need much provocation to start a war.</span></p><p><span style="">He was that kind of a person&#x2026;.</span></p><p><span style="">Lee-sahngho&#x2019;s expression darkened, and this sight stressed out Iello mightily.</span></p><p><span style="">Iello&#x2019;s plan had gone off the rail, and he didn&#x2019;t think it could be righted.</span></p><p><span style="">He should have waited a little bit longer. &#xA0;He would have never expected Ibrit to be so powerless against Kahng-woojin. &#xA0;Moreover, he had appeared in plain sight after Kahng-woojin had left Seoul&#x2026;.</span></p><p><span style="">Lee-sahngho had done a good job bringing order to a chaotic situation when a new Dimensional lord had made his appearance.</span></p><p><span style="">However, this was also the crux of their troubles right now.</span></p><p><span style="">Iello had awkwardly thrown his hat into the ring, and now he couldn&#x2019;t go back into hiding.</span></p><p><span style="">To make matters worse, Kahng-woojin was heading straight for them.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;W...we have to put up barriers.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Speak.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;There are several groups within Korea, who look at us in a positive light. &#xA0;If we bring them into the fold as allies, Kahng-woojin wouldn&#x2019;t dare to attack&#x2026;..&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Shut up&#xFF01;&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Pah-ahh-ahng!</span></p><p><span style="">His yell created a shockwave, and Lee-sahngho was embedded within the wall of ice.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Useless bastard.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The usefulness of having a vassal, who originated from earth, seemed to have come to an end.</span></p><p><span style="">His opponent was too terrible to use conventional wisdom to predict his moves. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">Should he find a peaceful solution?</span></p><p><span style="">However, the fight with the bastard couldn&#x2019;t be avoided.</span></p><p><span style="">His only regret was the fact that this was supposed to be an easy fight on earth. &#xA0;However, things kept getting more complicated, and now a direct conflict was inevitable.</span></p><p><span style="">He had waited for others to cook the meat, so he&#x2019;ll be able to just pick up and eat it. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">Now he had to roast it himself.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;If I&#x2019;m going to do this, I&#x2019;ll do it for certain.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Great lord Iello.</span></p><p><span style="">He was able to gather only 25 Dimensional Codes, but he possessed something that the high rank great lords didn&#x2019;t have.</span></p><p><span style="">He had gathered numerous low rank Dimensional lords as subordinates under the a guise of an alliance.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I&#x2019;ll gather all of them.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Iello started gathering all his warriors. &#xA0;He&#x2019;ll be in a war to gain the most important Dimensional Code.</span></p><p><span style="">There was Rajakui of the Yellow Lizard Alliance from Planet Jaku, Iseural alliance of the Planet Litan, the alliance from the Planet Joojooro&#x2026;..</span></p><p><span style="">Then there was the Dimensional lord Nakamura from earth, who pledged his loyalty to him&#x2026;.</span></p><p><span style="">It didn&#x2019;t matter what level of power they had. &#xA0;Iello summoned all the Dimensional lords.</span></p><p><span style="">New National Assembly Building, Sejong City.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;W...what should we do?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The chief secretary whispered into Kim-byungmahn&#x2019;s ears. &#xA0;One could clearly hear the worry in his voice, so Kim-byungmahn swallowed his groan.</span></p><p><span style="">Was he the last president of Korea, who will share the final fate with Korea?</span></p><p><span style="">Currently, the situation in Korea was akin to walking a tight rope above an endless abyss. &#xA0;It was a very tenuous situation.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Shouldn&#x2019;t we at least agree to discuss the terms given by Iello? &#xA0;The civilians are very nervous right now.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;No way. &#xA0;He suddenly appeared without warning, and he is trying to coerce us into accepting a deal. &#xA0;We shouldn&#x2019;t listen to his words.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Several members of the legislative body raised their voice to give their opinions.</span></p><p><span style="">When the Black Undying Crow Ibrit made its appearance on earth, Seoul was swept up by a widespread Dungeon Break. &#xA0;However, Kahng-woojin had appeared out of nowhere to succeed in defending Seoul.</span></p><p><span style="">However, after Kahng-woojin left, Iello had appeared immediately.</span></p><p><span style="">Iello was a unique Dimensional lord in that he used the ex-Hwarang guild master Lee-sahngho as a go between. &#xA0;It was possible to communicate with Iello.</span></p><p><span style="">The National Assembly squabbled in regards to the proposed alliance&#x2026;..</span></p><p><span style="">Both sides refused to compromise on the issue when the monsters suddenly appearing again.</span></p><p><span style="">The Dragon Rajakui, who had invaded Seoul before, appeared once again...</span></p><p><span style="">Moreover, Dimensional lords were setting up Colonies all over Seoul&#x2026; If those Synchronized&#x2026;.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;We lost Seoul overnight. &#xA0;We have to make a decision.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;They offered the alliance first, and we fell for their trick. While we were discussing the issue, they took advantage of our indecisiveness. &#xA0;They already made their camps.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Some suspected that the request for an alliance was a ruse. &#xA0;It bought them time to start building their Colonies.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Since events have turned out like this, we should ally with Iello.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Events were already stacked against them, so some members were pushing for an alliance.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;How can we trust his offer? He isn&apos;t human. &#xA0;He is just a chunk of ice.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Japan has already allied themselves with him! &#xA0;If we decide to fight Iello, we become enemies with Japan.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Iello was probably afraid of attacking Japan, so he is trying to take over Seoul. &#xA0;How can we let this be?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The members of the legislative body were shouting at the top of their lungs as they fought. &#xA0;The president&#x2019;s worries deepened when he saw this. &#xA0;Iello had appeared suddenly out of nowhere to propose an alliance, and now he was basically occupying the main room of the house by residing within Seoul.</span></p><p><span style="">Iello had basically invaded Korea, yet they had to ally with him&#x2026; &#xA0;Now he was expanding his forces, so his actions weren&#x2019;t trustworthy.</span></p><p><span style="">When one of the senators caught sight of the silent president, he spoke barbed words towards the president.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;At the very least, give us some measures we can take.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;The status of our alliance doesn&#x2019;t matter, since Seoul has already fallen.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The president immediately shot back with his words.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Is this your official stance? &#xA0;Are you declaring the Dimensional lord Iello as an enemy?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Please lower your voice. &#xA0;I&#x2019;m just speaking the truth.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The president increased his voice as he spoke about the current situation.</span></p><p><span style="">Currently, it didn&#x2019;t matter if this was an attempt at an alliance or an invasion. &#xA0;The other side held all the cards. &#xA0;In such an uncertain situation, Iello&#x2019;s talk of an alliance were sweet nothings.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;We are already allied with Alandal. &#xA0;What will you all do if there is bad blood between Alandal and Iello?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">At the president&#x2019;s question, a senator, who had been antagonistic from the start, yelled out as if it was a no brainer.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;The king of Alandal does whatever the hell he wants. &#xA0;Wouldn&#x2019;t it be better to trust Iello? &#xA0;At the very least, he isn&#x2019;t out of control.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">President Kim-byungmahn let out a bitter laugh.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;As I&#x2019;ve said before, we hold no bargaining chips that can be used in negotiations.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">It brought him to tears, but it was the truth.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Alandal&#x2019;s flying fortress is approaching.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The flying fortress had turned its nose at Taiwan, and it had headed northward. &#xA0;The Korean government sent an inquiry, but Alandal hadn&#x2019;t given their official reply yet.</span></p><p><span style="">This was only a guess, but everyone assumed the flying fortress was returning to start up a big fight.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;It is a war between Alandal and Iello...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">It would be a war fought on Korean soil, yet their thoughts were elsewhere.</span></p><p><span style="">The Korean government didn&#x2019;t have the power to stop the fight. &#xA0;They weren&#x2019;t even united enough to choose sides, so there weren&#x2019;t a lot they could do.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;We have to focus on evacuating civilians from Seoul.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The president&#x2019;s words set off the members of the legislative body.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Are you saying we should abandon Seoul?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Should you be saying this as the president?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Kim-byungmahn stood up as he looked at them. &#xA0;A vein was popping out on his neck.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Where are we at right now?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;&#x2026;&#x2026;.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">They had left their old National Assembly building. &#xA0;The only ones that were left behind in Seoul were the people, who didn&#x2019;t have the resources to leave. &#xA0;The elites and the leaders of the country had already pull out all their families from Seoul. &#xA0;They were long gone from Seoul.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I&#x2019;m not saying we should abandon Seoul.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The tears he had been holding back fell from Kim-byungmahn&#x2019;s eyes.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I&#x2019;m saying let&#x2019;s save our citizens.&#x201D;</span></p>
