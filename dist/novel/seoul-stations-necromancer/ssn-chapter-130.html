<p><span style="">Chapter 130 - Liah (2)</span></p><p><span style="">The Orc Rider guerilla unit lead by Bibi was starting to attack the opponent&apos;s base. &#xA0;The status of the battle was dramatically turning in favor of Bibi. &#xA0;Even a Wyvern Nest had been built, and their Tech Tree had been upgraded. &#xA0;In a flash, the enemy&apos;s base had been been captured.</span></p><p><span style="">&lt;You were victorious in your Dimensional Battle.&gt; </span></p><p><span style="">&lt;As a reward for the Dimensional Battle, you have earned 10,000 points.&gt; </span></p><p><span style="">&lt;You will now be able to initiate the Victor&apos;s Rights.&gt; </span></p><p><span style="">&lt;Please select either Loot the Storage Room or Loot the Domain.&gt; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Huh?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Woojin let out a dejected sound as he looked at Bibi. &#xA0;She stood up from the Commander&apos;s Chair, and she made a V sign with her fingers. &#xA0;She let out a soft laugh. </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Oh-heh-heh-heh. &#xA0;You said you are going to give me the 10,000 points?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Y...yeah. &#xA0;Who taught you?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;It&apos;s a secret. Heh heh.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Was it Jaemin?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Huhk!&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Woojin knew his guess had been on point as he looked at Bibi&apos;s surprised reaction.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;I knew that build order looked familiar to me.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">This could be called the speciality of the Korean people.</span></p><p><span style="">Weren&#x2019;t Korean high school students only a step below pro gamers in most other countries? &#xA0;Jaemin had been focused on his studies, so he hadn&apos;t enjoyed playing games as much as the other kids. Still, he was still much better than Bibi.</span></p><p><span style="">He knew the fundamental concepts behind the strategy games.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Heh heh. &#xA0;I continued to do mock battles with Jaemin.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">While Woojin spent 3 days on earth, Bibi had practised for 12 days within the Dimensional Domain.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I&apos;m still not at Jaemin&apos;s level, but I&apos;ll be able to beat him soon with more practice.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hmm. &#xA0;Shall I let Jaemin take over?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">The Dimensional Battle wasn&apos;t that important to him. &#xA0;He didn&apos;t care who did it.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;No! They&apos;re my points!&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">While Bibi and Woojin was bickering, an announcement window appeared in front of him.</span></p><p><span style="">&lt;Random Choice. Loot the Domain was chosen as the Victor&apos;s Rights.&gt; </span></p><p><span style="">&lt;You&apos;ve plundered 7% of Liah&apos;s Fortress.&gt; </span></p><p><span style="">&lt;You&apos;ve acquired 850 points of Bloodstones.&gt; </span></p><p><span style="">&lt;You&apos;ve seized the buildings Goblin Research Center and Mercenary Guild.&gt; </span></p><p><span style="">&lt;You&apos;ve captured Domain residents. &#xA0;There are 14 humans, three Goblins and one Elf.&gt; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hmmm. I&apos;ll think about choosing either you or Jaemin at a later time.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hooong. I&apos;ll overtake Jaemin soon.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">While he received Bibi&apos;s strong promise, Woojin started managing his Domain.</span></p><p><span style="">He had earned 4 days of Protection Period through the victory. &#xA0;In earth&apos;s time, it was only one day. &#xA0;It felt a bit lacking, but it wasn&apos;t necessarily a bad thing.</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin needed to level up, so he need some hunting time.</span></p><p><span style="">He just needed to come visit the Dimensional Domain every other day to accept the Dimensional Battle. &#xA0;Well, even if he lost in the Dimensional Battle, he&#x2019;ll be regaining everything back using the Revenger&apos;s Retribution.</span></p><p><span style="">&lt;Liah-nim has requested a Duel.&gt; </span></p><p><span style="">&lt;The Revenger&apos;s Retribution was activated. &#xA0;The Duel will be forcefully carried out.&gt; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Would you look at this?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">There was a Dimensional lord that was as confident at fighting as Woojin.</span></p><p><span style="">&lt;You will be summoned to the battlefield &apos;Waste Land&apos;.&gt; </span></p><p><span style="">&lt;If you win, you will be able to initiate the Victor&apos;s Rights or &#xA0;Revenger&apos;s Retribution.&gt; </span></p><p><span style="">&lt;If you lose, you will experience death. &#xA0;You will be revived after 12 days.&gt; </span></p><p><span style="">Woojin was dropped into the middle of a wasteland where dusts flew in the wind. &#xA0;He looked around his surrounding. &#xA0;He spotted a red haired beauty standing in place with a angry expression on her face.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Gun?&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">Woojin tilted his head in confusion as he looked at the weapon in her hands. &#xA0;It looked a bit different from the ones on earth, but it looked to have a similar function as a gun.</span></p><p><span style="">She had a thin sword equipped on her waist, but her main weapons seemed to be the revolver strapped to her thighs and the rifle in her hands.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Chet. &#xA0;I can&apos;t believe I lost to a new lord. &#xA0;Moreover, you are a mere human.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;&#x2026;.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Woojin wordlessly stared at Liah as she spoke. She was also a human, yet she spoke those callous words.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Planet Earth? You are from the most popular destination right now. Your name is Kahng-woojin? Shall we exchange pleasantries?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Woojin&apos;s brows furrowed at Liah&apos;s words.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What? Aren&apos;t you being a little bit too cold to a fellow human?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Liah propped the long rifle onto her side. &#xA0;She took out a cigarette from her pocket, and she lit it with a flame.</span></p><p><span style="">Hwah-roohk.</span></p><p><span style="">A flame suddenly appeared on top of her finger. She was a magic user, who used guns and swords. &#xA0;Woojin folded his arms, and he decided to observe her actions a little bit longer.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What nonsense are you trying to pull?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Heh-eh. &#xA0;I guess you aren&apos;t a mute.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">She took a long drag on her cigarette. &#xA0;She spoke as she let out the smoke from her cigarette.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;We&apos;ll probably see each other more often in the future. &#xA0;I&apos;m just saying let&apos;s have an amicable relationship.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;It is killed or be killed. &#xA0;Is there a need to become friends with anyone?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Woojin laughed at her nonsensical words. &#xA0;In the end, they&apos;ll be enemies if they meet on the Dimensional Battle. &#xA0;He had no reason or interest in befriending someone he would have to kill. &#xA0;&#xA0;Liah started laughing uproariously as if she found something to be funny.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ah. I can really tell you are a novice lord. Ha ha. &#xA0;How&apos;s earth? &#xA0;Is it a good place to hunt? &#xA0;Shall I link my spare Dimensional Fragments there?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;You are better off not doing that.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">The laughter on Liah&apos;s face deepened at Woojin&apos;s words.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ho-oh. What? &#xA0;Are you the planet&apos;s guardian or something like that?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Everyone wanted to to protect their home planet. That was a given.</span></p><p><span style="">However, Earth was a clean planet. &#xA0;There were no flags placed there by any Dimensional lord. </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Give it up. &#xA0;You won&apos;t be able to protect them.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;&#x2026;?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;This noonah is giving you a warning. It is a fruitless effort.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Woojin frowned when he heard Liah&apos;s words. She didn&apos;t care about how he took her words. &#xA0;She took another deep drag on the cigarette, and she threw it on the floor.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hoo-ooh. &#xA0;Shall we start?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Liah gripped the long rifle that had been resting on her side. &#xA0;The point of the rifle was touching the butt of the cigarette. &#xA0;The corner of her mouth lifted as she looked at Woojin. </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Are you really this naive? &#xA0;You allowed me to load my weapon.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;&#x2026;.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Woojin had already realized why she was being so verbose. </span></p><p><span style="">She wasn&apos;t talking, because she met a fellow human Dimensional lord. &#xA0;She wasn&#x2019;t curious about earth either. &#xA0;She was just buying time, so she could get ready for the battle.</span></p><p><span style="">He had fallen for her plan so easily that it was no wonder she thought of him as naive. </span></p><p><span style="">Chul-kuhk. </span></p><p><span style="">She loaded the long rifle, and she aimed it at Woojin. &#xA0;He stood there without moving an inch.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What? Are you naive, dumb or bluffing?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Dahl-gghahk. </span></p><p><span style="">A small sound was heard from the gun, but the effect was quite surprising.</span></p><p><span style="">Kwahng! </span></p><p><span style="">A bullet didn&apos;t exit the muzzle. &#xA0;Smoke started pouring out of the gun.</span></p><p><span style="">Koo-koo-koo-koohng! </span></p><p><span style="">The cloud of smoke started to grow, and it was hard to see even an inch in front of oneself. The smoke obstructed one&apos;s vision. &#xA0;Moreover, the smoke seemed to be poisonous. &#xA0;It stung the skin, and one could feel one&apos;s movement slow.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ha ha ha. &#xA0;You were pretty good at the Dimensional Battle, yet you seem to suck at Dueling. Aren&apos;t you giving up a little too fast?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Woojin didn&apos;t know where Liah was, since the smoke was covering her whereabouts. &#xA0;Her voice also sounded as if it was emanating from all sides. &#xA0;It felt as if his vision and hearing had been sealed.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Who said I&apos;m giving up?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hoo hoo. &#xA0;Now that I&apos;ve deployed the Death&apos;s Cloud, you won&apos;t be able to win against me.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Her voice rang out like an echo, and the sound of a single bullet being shot was heard.</span></p><p><span style="">Tah-ahng, kahng! </span></p><p><span style="">Woojin reflexively blocked the bullet with the Steel Staff he brought out. &#xA0;He heard Liah&apos;s voice, and it sounded as if she was having fun.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;How long do you think you can block my attack? &#xA0;Doesn&apos;t it feel like you&apos;re fighting couple dozen people?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">The Death&apos;s Cloud hid her whereabouts, and she was shooting from all angles as she harassed Woojin. In the end, he would accumulate damage, and she would be able to kill him.</span></p><p><span style="">The Death&apos;s Cloud took a very long time to load, yet if she was able to deploy it, she had a win rate of almost 90%. &#xA0;It was a deadly technique.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;It feels like fighting several dozen people&#x2026;.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Shwahhhhng, kahng! </span></p><p><span style="">Liah ambushed Woojin with her sword, and he brushed off the attack. &#xA0;For a brief moment, he saw her, but she immediately jumped away. &#xA0;She was covered up once again by the smoke.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;This is fun.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Woojin summoned his Death Knights.</span></p><p><span style="">Hwee-ri-reek. </span></p><p><span style="">The black smoke coalesced as the Death Knights were summoned. &#xA0;Woojin couldn&apos;t see them, because of the smoke. &#xA0;However, Woojin could feel where they were located at.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Instead of making it seem like I&#x2019;m fighting a couple dozen people, why don&apos;t you fight several dozen people instead?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hoong! I&apos;ll just eliminate them one by one.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">She didn&apos;t have much information on her opponent, so she had no idea he was a summoning type human. Liah snorted as Woojin put on a big smile on his face.</span></p><p><span style="">The smile looked a bit evil.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;If you don&apos;t like several dozen, then what do you think about several hundred? &#xA0;Or several thousand?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Hwee-ri-ri-reek. </span></p><p><span style="">The Death Knights correctly interpreted Woojin&apos;s order, and they summoned all the Skeleton Warriors under him.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;W...what the hell?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">The sound of Liah being taken aback was heard. &#xA0;The Undead army was being summoned at a rate where the Skeleton Warriors completely filled the Death&#x2019;s Cloud. &#xA0;He gave an order to his Undead army.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Catch that bitch.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">[We will bring the Death&apos;s Blessing to our king&apos;s enemy!] </span></p><p><span style="">The Death Knights ran outward. &#xA0;The sound of fighting lasted only a moment. &#xA0;Soon, the smoke started to thin out.</span></p><p><span style="">[Goo-roo-roo.] </span></p><p><span style="">The Death Knights&apos; spears had pierced through various parts of her body. &#xA0;She was being propped up in an awkward posture where she wasn&apos;t standing nor was she kneeling. Woojin approached Liah.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Warning?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;&#x2026;.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Woojin changed his Steel Staff into an Axe.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;You worry about your own business.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Kwah-jeek! </span></p><p><span style="">Woojin&apos;s axe lodged itself into Liah&apos;s head.</span></p><p><span style="">Fellow human? Protector of earth? She knew the end result, because she had tried it? </span></p><p><span style="">Such an insignificant Dimensional lord dared to give him a warning?</span></p><p><span style="">&lt;You&apos;ve won in the Duel.&gt; </span></p><p><span style="">&lt;Liah&apos;s Revenge has failed. &#xA0;The Victor&apos;s Claim is being initiated.&gt; </span></p><p><span style="">&lt;Please choose either Loot the Storage Room or Loot the Domain.&gt; </span></p><p><span style="">Woojin chose to loot the Storage Room. &#xA0;The Items that were stored in Liah&apos;s Dimensional Storage Room flitted across his vision, and several items were chosen at random. &#xA0;Amongst them, a single item caught Woojin&apos;s eyes.</span></p><p><span style="">&lt;Skia&apos;s Boots&gt; </span></p><p><span style="">This was the Adventurer&apos;s god Skia&apos;s Boots.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;My luck is pretty good.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">The shoe itself was a good item. &#xA0;However, this item was essential in making one of items in the Thrash&apos;s Set. &#xA0;It was an essential ingredient in making the &apos;Thrash&apos;s March&apos;.</span></p><p><span style="">All the other ingredients could be obtained on earth, but there were several items that could only be obtained on Alphen. &#xA0;Skia&#x2019;s Boots was one such item.</span></p><p><span style="">The Adventurer&apos;s god Skia was one of the gods of Alphen.</span></p><p><span style="">He had already been planning on heading towards Alphen, but he might be able to obtain one of the Set Items before he did so.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Wait a moment&#x2026;. If I do well in the Dimensional Battles, it might be better for me?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">He couldn&#x2019;t continuously request Dimensional Battles. &#xA0;If he continued to win, he would earn Points, and he could purchase the Ingredient Items he needed&#x2026;.</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin had two stores he could use.</span></p><p><span style="">There was the Achievement Point Store, and the Dimensional Store.</span></p><p><span style="">The Achievement Points could be earned by hunting. &#xA0;However, the Dimensional Energy could only be earned by the vassals of one&#x2019;s Dimensional Domain.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What&apos;s Jaemin doing right about now?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Woojin was in a good mood as he laughed. &#xA0;He organized the Items he looted, and he exited the castle. &#xA0;Why did Jaemin look so handsome today?</span></p><p><span style="">*** </span></p><p><span style="">&lt;You&apos;ve lost the Duel. &#xA0;You have failed in your Revenge.&gt; </span></p><p><span style="">&lt;You will be revived after 12 days.&gt; </span></p><p><span style="">Her consciousness faded away.</span></p><p><span style="">Her death was of no consequence. &#xA0;She head already experienced it a couple hundred of times. She was used to it, but it didn&apos;t mean she enjoyed it.</span></p><p><span style="">The fear and extreme stress she felt was expressed as anger.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Son of a bitch!&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">Amongst the Dimensional lords, Liah was known as a rabid dog.</span></p><p><span style="">She prefered Duels instead of the Dimensional Battles. &#xA0;If she lost, she always requested the Revenger&#x2019;s Right.</span></p><p><span style="">Moreover, she kept challenging her opponent until she won.</span></p><p><span style="">At that moment, her next target was established.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Planet Earth? You wait and see.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">It was fruitless to protect a planet.</span></p><p><span style="">In the end, the only thing a lord could defend was one&apos;s Dimensional Domain. &#xA0;Eventually, everyone buried one&#x2019;s home planet in one&#x2019;s heart.</span></p><p><span style="">It was always the same. &#xA0;One&#x2019;s home planet was never destroyed by the invaders. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">It was always destroyed by an insider&#x2026;.</span></p><p><span style="">Earth was a sinking ship.</span></p><p><span style="">It was insanity to repair the boat when one was trying to stay alive. &#xA0;Everyone had to find their own path to survival.</span></p><p><span style="">One could swim, or one could get on the invading boat that had sunk your boat...</span></p><p><span style="">Liah&apos;s consciousness faded away, and her body was surround by complete emptiness.</span></p>
