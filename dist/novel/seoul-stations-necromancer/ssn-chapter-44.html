This is a regular chapter for next week. I&#x2019;m releasing it a little bit earlier. Please turn off the adblockers if you are able to.)</span></span></p><p><span style="">After she finished her shift, Jiwon returned to the dormitory, then she fell immediately into her bed.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Whew.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The company had originally been a small one, but it had prospered from the Dungeon business. Everyday her workload increased, and each day felt more daunting as time passed.</span></p><p><span style="">The door to the dormitory opened. Her roommates, Haejin and Nayoung, came in.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Uh-whew. Unni did a good job.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes. You guys also did a good job.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Haejin and Nayoung were both 21 years old. Jiwon was a 24 year old unni, but they weren&#x2019;t comfortable with the age difference. They might also be uncomfortable with her appearance. They got along well with each other, and they excluded her.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Unni. We will wash first.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yeah. You guys do that.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Jiwon opened her hand-phone to take a brief break. After a hard day of work, she always read webtoons for a brief respite. Then she read short romance novellas.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hoo hoo.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Jiwon let her imagination run wild as she thought of herself as the protagonist inside her romance novella.</span></p><p><span style="">The sudden Dungeon Shock kill her parents during the 3rd year of her high school.</span></p><p><span style="">After the Dungeon Shock, the subsequent Dungeon Breaks put Seoul into turmoil. Jiwon had almost died on that day, but she was barely saved by an unknown Roused.</span></p><p><span style="">She remembered the Roused&#x2019;s face, but she didn&#x2019;t have any way of meeting him again.</span></p><p><span style="">However, the cost of being saved was high. She had lost too many things.</span></p><p><span style="">She was called a goddess, and she was the object of everyone&#x2019;s attention. She had been haughty, and she had rejected every single guy, who had confessed to her. However, her life had crashed in an instant, and everyone looked at her as if she was a monster.</span></p><p><span style="">Or they would look at her in pity.</span></p><p><span style="">No man would ask her out just from pity.</span></p><p><span style="">This was why Jiwon had never dated before, and the novellas made Jiwon&#x2019;s heart flutter. After she got off work, it was her sole comfort.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ah, this one&#x2019;s fun. This author always ends it at the most entertaining part.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">She had finished reading couple tantalizing novellas, but her dormitory dongsaengs were still using the restroom. Jiwon had some time left, so she started reading articles on the portal site.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Uh? It&#x2019;s Woojin.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">She clicked on the hottest news article. She saw Woojin&#x2019;s picture on the first screen, and Jiwon&#x2019;s face unwittingly became red.</span></p><p><span style="">As if he wasn&#x2019;t satisfied something, Woojin&#x2019;s sour face made her laugh.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Heh. Woojin is incredibly famous.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The portal&#x2019;s main page was half adorned with articles about Woojin. He was that hot.</span></p><p><span style="">[Kang-woojin&#x2019;s Guild Alandal registered. Management Bureau is reviewing.]</span></p><p><span style="">[Korea&#x2019;s 11th A rank Roused Kang-Woojin. Which star did he come from?]</span></p><p><span style="">[Supernova Kang-woojin. No 1 Kim-kangchul&#x2019;s opinion?]</span></p><p><span style="">[Kang-woojin&#x2019;s man. Who is Hong-sunggoo??]</span></p><p><span style="">[Kang-woojin&#x2019;s highschool, Mido High school. His teacher&#x2019;s interview.]</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Uh? Our 3rd year Korean history teacher spoke about him.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">It was fascinating, and exciting to see someone Jiwon knew become famous.</span></p><p><span style="">She had shared alcohol with such a person couple days ago. It felt like she was keeping a secret the public didn&#x2019;t know. It was a novel feeling.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hmmm.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">After she read over the articles for awhile, she got up then she opened the closet next to her bed. There were numerous hat of various colors stacked inside.</span></p><p><span style="">Hats were an essential item she couldn&#x2019;t live without.</span></p><p><span style="">Amongst all of them, there was a hat that occupying the corner of the closet by itself. The hat had transparent tapes on the side with several strands of hair clinging on to it.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hoo hoo.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">She thought about what happened couple days ago, and Jiwon smile automatically.</span></p><p><span style="">People filled with prejudice always stared at her with pity and disgust. She had lived through it for the past 5 years.</span></p><p><span style="">She had met an alumni of her high school after 5 years, and Kang-woojin was like the protagonists inside the novellas.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Oh yeah. It&#x2019;s about time Jaemin gets off school.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Jiwon always called Jaemin around the time he got off. He was her only family member, and the only reason why she continued on living.</span></p><p><span style="">[Uh, noonah.]</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Huh? Are you sick? What&#x2019;s wrong with your voice?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">He was sick. His heart hurt. Ha-ah.</span></p><p><span style="">[Nothing. I&#x2019;m fine.]</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ok. Did you eat? Are you on your way to the tutoring school?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">[Yes. Oh yeah. Woojin hyung texted me, and he wants to know noonah&#x2019;s phone number. Should I give it to him?]</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Uh. Uh? Woojin wants it?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Do-jiwon&#x2019;s heart strangely beat faster when she heard it was Woojin.</span></p><p><span style="">[It&#x2019;s a little bit weird, right? I&#x2019;ll tell him no&#x2026;.]</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Tell him!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">[Uh, uh?]</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I said tell him.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">[&#x2026;that hyung is a bit dangerous&#x2026;.]</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Are you trying to get smart with noonah these days?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">[I&#x2026;I understand, noonah. I&#x2019;ve arrived at the tutoring school. Do you mind if I end the call?]</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;All right. Study hard. I&#x2019;m busy this week, so I won&#x2019;t be able to visit you during the weekend.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">[Ok. I understand.]</span></p><p><span style="">Jiwon ended the call, and her face was flush.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ha-ah.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Why did he want to know? Why did Woojin ask Jaemin for her number?</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;I don&#x2019;t get why it&#x2019;s such a big deal. She&#x2019;s still pretty.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin&#x2019;s words were still fresh in her ears. She was sure she had heard him say it. It wasn&#x2019;t something she misheard when she was drunk.</span></p><p><span style="">Maybe Woojin&#x2026;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Eh-ee. No way.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">There are those that date ugly women, but there weren&#x2019;t anyone who would date a monster. She squashed the sense of anticipation that was trying to rear its head.</span></p><p><span style="">Click.</span></p><p><span style="">The door to the restroom opened. Haemin and Nayoung came out, and when they saw Jiwon in front of her closet, they were startled.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ah, unni!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Uh uh?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I know we are in our rooms, but can&#x2019;t you wear your hat?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;That&#x2019;s right, unni. You should have some manners. We were surprised.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Uh. Ok..&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Jiwon hurriedly covered her face as she gathered her towel. She went into the restroom. Jiwon turned on the shower then she started to undress.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ah whew. That orc bitch. She surprised me.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ah, really. When I save some more money, the first think I&#x2019;ll do is leave this dorm. Every time I see her my heart trembles.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;How can she live with such a face? If it was me, I would have killed myself.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">They spoke as if they intended for Jiwon to hear everything. Jiwon soundlessly undressed. When she took off everything, Jiwon&#x2019;s body was beautiful.</span></p><p><span style="">The sound of water from the shower wasn&#x2019;t enough, so she also turned on the washbasin&#x2019;s faucets.</span></p><p><span style="">Swahhhh.</span></p><p><span style="">She placed both her hands on the washbasin as she stood.</span></p><p><span style="">She had heard those words ad nauseam, but those words hurt much more today. It sounded like they were saying she didn&#x2019;t have the right to pursue anyone.</span></p><p><span style="">Ddook, ddoo-dook.</span></p><p><span style="">Her sad tears joined the flowing water.</span></p><p><span style="">No one understood her&#x2026;&#x2026;.</span></p><p><span style="">The monster inside the mirror cried more sadly today.</span></p><p><span style="">*</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ho-ooh.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">After Sunggoo finished gathering everything, he let out a sigh. Then he headed towards Woojin.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hyung-nim. I&#x2019;ve gathered them all.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Really?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin, who had been resting, put all the loot Sunggo had gathered into his inventory.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hyung-nim. Your hunting speed is much faster than before.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Of course. He had already almost reached level 33.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Less Artifacts are starting to show up.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes, hyung-nim. It seems we gathered most of the Artifacts.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">At Sunggoo&#x2019;s answer, Woojin cleared his palate in regret. He gathered only 3 Artifacts this run.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Let&#x2019;s go out now.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes, hyung-nim.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">When Woojin and Sunggoo left the Dungeon, Woo-soonghoon was waiting for them.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Director Jung sent me. I was told to wait for president to come out, then I&#x2019;m tasked to bringing you back.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">It seemed Jung-minchan had sent Soonghoon as a chauffeur.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Where is Director Jung?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;It seemed the guild was approved, so he&#x2019;ll be back in the office after he visits the Management Bureau.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ok.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Then, I&#x2019;ll bring the car around now, president.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;You do that.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Woo-soonghoon disappeared, and Sunggoo asked a question he had wanted to ask for awhile.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hyung-nim. How did you get acquainted with Mr. Soonghoon?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Him?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes, hyung-nim.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;He sold me a hand phone.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The parking lot was right next door. Soonghoon drove the car out, and he started honking.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ah. The reporters in the front should get out of way!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">When he saw Soonghoon disperse the reports with his honking, cold sweat ran down Sunggoo. He put someone who sold him a hand phone into the position of founding member?</span></p><p><span style="">When Woojin approached the car, Soonghoon got off to open the backdoor.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Please get on.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">When Woojin and Sunggoo tried to enter the car, the reporters charged forward like a swarm of bees.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Mr. Kang-woojin. I&#x2019;ve heard you aren&#x2019;t taking appointments for the Seoul National University Station&#x2019;s 6th exit yet. When are you going to open it up for the public?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Mr. Kang-woojin&#x2026;.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">At the reporters&#x2019; torrent of questions, Woo-soonghoon put on a menacing expression, then he started to shout.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ah. Get out of the way. They just finished clearing a Dungeon, so they are tired. Please request an interview through the official channels in our guild. If you continue this close coverage, we will respond with legal suits against the relevant media outfits. We aren&#x2019;t taking any questions right now. Please step back. I&#x2019;ve memorized everyone&#x2019;s face. Even if you request an official interview, I&#x2019;ll remember you all. I&#x2019;m very capable of holding a grudge.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;&#x2026;.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The reporters were already sick of Woo-soonghoon&#x2019;s rapid-fire words, so they retreated. Woo-soonghoon lightly got into the driver&#x2019;s seat.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Director Jung said he is going to sue the media companies?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;He won&#x2019;t, president.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Uh? He won&#x2019;t?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I lied.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;Uh, good job.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin&#x2019;s praise caught Woo-soonghoon&#x2019;s ears.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Please allow me to serve you, president.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;A&#x2026;all right.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">He had already folded his store. He&#x2019;ll give himself completely to the guild. Woo-soonghoon grabbed the handle as a sense of duty filled him.</span></p><p><span style="">*</span></p><p><span style="">Three days had passed. He had cleared the Dungeons 9 times, and the clear time recorded on the last raid was 2 hours and 49 minutes. This caused the reporters to busily write articles, and release them in droves.</span></p><p><span style="">It was an unprecedented event.</span></p><p><span style="">Kang-woojin hadn&#x2019;t met the number 1 ranked Roused of Korea, but he was frequently being compared to Kim-gangchul now. No, he was being compared to the famous Roused of the world.</span></p><p><span style="">The person in question, Kang-woojin, showed no interest in the subject.</span></p><p><span style="">He sat on the sofa inside the president&#x2019;s room, and he was eating snacks out of a full basket.</span></p><p><span style="">&lt;&#x2018;Sound Mushroom&#x2019; was ingested.&gt;</span></p><p><span style="">&lt;&#x2018;Strength of Determination&#x2019; was absorbed.&gt;</span></p><p><span style="">&lt;&#x2018;Raenin&#x2019;s Blood&#x2019; was absorbed.&gt;</span></p><p><span style="">The medicines that increased Stat couldn&#x2019;t be taken infinitely. The body needed time to accept the medicine, and the time needed increased every time a medicine was taken.</span></p><p><span style="">He took Raenin&#x2019;s Blood and Chen&#x2019;s Sagacity. They both increased Vitality, and he had taken them in succession. It would take a long time for the items to be digested.</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin ate a variety of medicines, which increased other Stats. Some could be eaten again after 2 hours, and others took a whopping 17 days.</span></p><p><span style="">Sunggoo watched Woojin eat the Reinforcement Stones like candy, and he gulped.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;That one is worth 200 thousand, 170 thousand, and that one is worth 500 thousand dollars.&#x2026;.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin was a money eating hippo. A money eating hippo was in front of Sunggoo.</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin felt Sunggoo&#x2019;s gaze on him, so he spoke in a sly manner.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What? You want some too&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;N&#x2026;no. How could I&#x2026;.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The medicine called the Reinforcement Stones were being purchased by Director Jung in his spare times. There was a delay period in ingesting it, so he couldn&#x2019;t ingest all of them at once. Still, he could give couple to Sunggoo without feeling the loss.</span></p><p><span style="">Sunggoo had to follow him, and do the odd jobs for him. If he became stronger, his survivability would increase. Moreover, Woojin wouldn&#x2019;t have to worry about him as much.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Eat this, this and this.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin picked the medicines that would increase &#x2018;Strength&#x2019;, &#x2018;Agility&#x2019; and &#x2018;Stamina&#x2019;. He handed it over to Sunggoo.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;T&#x2026;thank you, hyung-nim.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Sunggoo was moved. He bowed to express his thanks.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Well, it&#x2019;s nothing.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">If he became stronger, then he could carry more loot. If his Agility increased, he&#x2019;ll be able to pick up items faster. If his Stamina increased, then he could work more.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;From now on, I&#x2019;ll give you couple medicines you&#x2019;ll need.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I, Hong-sunggoo, realize it was a blessing to have met hyung-nim.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;That&#x2019;s right, director of miscellaneous work. Hurry up and eat these.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Ah, the title described exactly what he did, but couldn&#x2019;t he call him something else?</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Director of miscellaneous work will try it.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Sunggoo acted as if he had received the medicine from his king. He started absorbing each of the medicine with an expression of ecstasy on his face. Woojin grinned then he took out his hand phone.</span></p><p><span style="">He opened the Messenger program then he pressed the chat window.</span></p><p><span style="">Chat with Do-jiwon-nim.</span></p><p><span style="">1[It&#x2019;s me.]</span></p><p><span style="">1[Isn&#x2019;t this Do-jiwon?]</span></p><p><span style="">1[Why don&#x2019;t you answer your phone?]</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ah. She hadn&#x2019;t seen this either.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The avatar had a picture of her and Jaemin. He was sure he had contacted Do-jiwon, but she wasn&#x2019;t picking up her phone or responding to his messages.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Huh. What the hell? Whether I give her the medicine or not, I can&#x2019;t do anything unless I meet her.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin spoke to himself, and Sunggoo replied back. Suggoo&#x2019;s face had turned red as he was absorbing the Reinforcement stones.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes? What are you talking about?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I&#x2019;m talking about Jiwon. She isn&#x2019;t answering her phone.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;If she is on her shift at the factory, she won&#x2019;t be able to use her phone. Still, it&#x2019;s Saturday, so isn&#x2019;t she off today?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Jaemin said she&#x2019;s too busy to come this weekend.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hmmm. Jiwon noonah doesn&#x2019;t really have any reasons to avoid you. D..did something happen that day?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;That day&#x2026;.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin frowned when he thought about the day when the three of them ate beef entrails.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Was she angry because of the tape&#x2026;?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;The hat kept falling off so I taped it on her..&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hmmm. I don&#x2019;t have any experience with women&#x2026;.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Uh-whew. What were you doing instead of going on dates?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;&#x2026;.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">He wanted to snap back with &#x2018;What about hyung-nim?&#x2019;, and it almost made it past his mouth before his patience persevered.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Go outside, and bring me someone who is well-versed in these matters.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;yes.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Sunggoo sulked as he exited the room, then after a moment, he brought Woo-soonghoon into the president&#x2019;s office.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Did you call me, president?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes, I did. Look at the text I sent. What&#x2019;s going on here? Is she purposefully not reading the text I sent?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">It was here. His chance was finally here.</span></p><p><span style="">Jung-minchan and Kim-haemin was outstanding at their job, and they were willing to do all the mundane work. Hong-sunggoo had a place in the guild since he was a Roused. Woo-soonghoon was the only one with a tenuous position within the guild.
