<p>Chapter 190 - Lord of Ice (2)</p><p><span style="">Alandal&apos;s plan of actions had changed.</span></p><p><span style="">They were being overly cautious and safety oriented. &#xA0;They only showed interest in gathering Bloodstones. &#xA0;This caused several media companies to keep pouring out criticisms.</span></p><p><span style="">Still, Alandal was unresponsive.</span></p><p><span style="">At first, only the brave ones threw stones at them. &#xA0;However, the media was piling on Alandal now. &#xA0;There was a consistent theme in all the news generated regarding Alandal.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;The king&#x2019;s absence means nothing will get done.</span></p><p><span style="">The media refused to let go of the subject. &#xA0;They even started criticizing Kahng-woojin.</span></p><p><span style="">Why did he go to Alphen?</span></p><p><span style="">He left earth to pursue the safety of another planet. &#xA0;Was he in the right to do this?</span></p><p><span style="">The world was in an uncertain situation, and everyone wanted a breakthrough that would solve the problems they faced. &#xA0;They didn&#x2019;t care if a hero stepped forward to stop the war, or a sacrificial lamb that would bear all the responsibility&#x2026;.</span></p><p><span style="">Alandal, who had been excessively unresponsive to all other works, was focused on a single task.</span></p><p><span style="">Kim-haemin slammed open the door to the Prime Minister&#x2019;s room, and he yelled out.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;We&apos;ve picked up the trace of Kim-kahngchul.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Huh? &#xA0;Where?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Jung-minchan had been getting ready to berate the man. &#xA0;However, he got up from his seat with a bright expression on his face.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;He&#x2019;s in London.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;London? &#xA0;England?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes and yes.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Damn bastard.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">This had to do with one of the specific orders given by Kahng-woojin.</span></p><p><span style="">They had focused all their attention on finding Dr. Toppler, and the escapee Kim-kahngchul. &#xA0;This was the first time they had found a clue.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;As expected, he has a connection with Professor Toppler.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Minchan thought Kahng-woojin had been spot on with his instructions. &#xA0;London was where Dr. Toppler was last seen. &#xA0;Since Kim-kahngchul appeared there, his appearance in London was meaningful.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;However, there is a problem.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What is it?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I&#x2019;m not sure if the British government will allow us entry&#x2026;.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">They were on a flying fortress roaming around the sky.</span></p><p><span style="">Once the international opinion on Alandal turned sour, it had stayed bad. &#xA0;Very few countries welcomed Alandal, since they weren&#x2019;t of any help. &#xA0;This was especially true for countries like England where there was a strong population of Roused.</span></p><p><span style="">Countries had learned about the new Item called the Dimensional Fragments. &#xA0;This was why they wanted to destroy the Colony of Dimensional lords through their own power. &#xA0;They refused to cooperate with others.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;We&apos;ll have to negotiate.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Jung-minchan had already planned on negotiating with other countries.</span></p><p><span style="">Alandal put their safety above all else, but it wasn&#x2019;t as if they were powerless.</span></p><p><span style="">Even if one considered only the active Wyvern Units, Alandal had more firepower than most small countries.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Let&#x2019;s turn our nose around.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The flying fortress was currently flying over India.</span></p><p><span style="">Minchan immediately went looking for Bibi.</span></p><p><span style="">She was a god-like figure inside the flying fortress called Bibi&apos;s Castle.</span></p><p><span style="">She had influence over the regions underneath the Colony, and she was able to create anything within the area of her influence. &#xA0;Moreover, the movement of the Colony had to be approved by her.</span></p><p><span style="">Minchan knew Bibi was on top of the deck.</span></p><p><span style="">If one looked down from the control tower, the deck looked like a small town.</span></p><p><span style="">If one walked between the buildings, one couldn&#x2019;t even tell that everything was floating in the air.</span></p><p><span style="">He arrived at the the edge of the deck. &#xA0;A cafe with a large terrace was located there.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;You are here, Prime Minister?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ah. Yes, mother.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Jung-minchan politely bowed towards Kahng-woojin&apos;s mother, Lee-soogyong.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ah-whew. &#xA0;I told you to stop doing that.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;No. &#xA0;How could I&#x2026;.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Minchan was uncomfortable calling her by her name. &#xA0;Lee-soogyong, who was abashed by being called by her title, barely got Minchan to call her &#x2018;mother&#x2019;. </span></p><p><span style="">Even now she stood up from her seat by the door to greet him. &#xA0;He was uncomfortable by such attention.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;You don&#x2019;t have to greet me like that.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ho ho. &#xA0;A person of high stature like the Prime Minister has come here, so how can I not greet you?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Ah, mother&#x2026;. &#xA0;Your son is way above me.</span></p><p><span style="">He had tried to get that point across to her multiple times, yet she didn&#x2019;t change. &#xA0;Therefore, he swallowed what he was about to say.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Shall I prepare your usual order?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes&#x2026;. &#xA0;Also, I also have business with Ms. Bibi&#x2026;.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Uh-whew. &#xA0;I was thoughtless. &#xA0;Hurry up and go see her. &#xA0;It seems I took away time from a busy man.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ah. &#xA0;It is nothing. &#xA0;I&#x2019;ll be going.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Lee-soogyong let go of Minchan&#x2019;s hand, and she went back to giving orders to her employees. &#xA0;In her mind, Jung-minchan was the highest ranked person in Alandal.</span></p><p><span style="">From her perspective, Kahng-woojin was just her son&#x2026;.</span></p><p><span style="">Jung-minchan gave his farewell, and he approached the terrace. &#xA0;&#xA0;Bibi and Sooah were sitting in chairs as they leisurely chatted with each other. &#xA0;He also saw Do-jaemin standing close to the two.</span></p><p><span style="">Jaemin was no longer affected by the sun, so his face was impassive even in the light of the sun.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ms. Bibi. &#xA0;We&#x2019;ll have to move the fortress to London.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Why London?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;We&apos;ve picked up on Kim-gahngchul&apos;s trace there.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hmm. &#xA0;He is the guy that ran away last time? &#xA0;All right.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Her master had ordered the recapture of this particular human. &#xA0;Bibi readily nodded her head, and she immediately moved the fortress. &#xA0;There was a slight tremor before Bibi&#x2019;s Castle started to move slowly.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Huh, Sooah? &#xA0;Are you feeling unwell?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;N...no.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Unlike her words, Sooah&#x2019;s face was pale. &#xA0;She had been well until a moment ago. &#xA0;When the color of her face changed, Do-jaemin was taken aback.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;W...what&#x2019;s going on?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Do-jaemin was asked by Kahng-woojin to protect Sooah. &#xA0;This was the first time he had seen such a change, so of course, he was taken aback by it.</span></p><p><span style="">On the other hand, Jung-minchan and Bibi&#x2019;s face was filled with worry, but they weren&#x2019;t surprised by what was happening.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;She is receiving an oracle.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ah&#x2026;.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Let us move to a different location.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Sooah was letting out cold sweat as her pupils moved around in an unfocused manner. &#xA0;Bibi quickly carried her into a room located at the corner of the cafe.</span></p><p><span style="">While they left, a man drinking a beverage was manipulating his handphone.</span></p><p><span style="">The man had just taken pictures of Sooah.</span></p><p><span style="">The man attached the photos to a message before sending it out.</span></p><p><span style="">[Possible target. &#xA0;Need confirmation.]</span></p><p><span style="">After the message was sent,the man finished his drink before a woman approached him.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Mr. Soongho. &#xA0;Your lunch time has ended. &#xA0;Hurry up and go.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ah. &#xA0;Yes, manager.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">He put the handphone back into his pocket, then Soongho got up from his seat.</span></p><p><span style="">Cafe&#x2019;s Backroom.</span></p><p><span style="">A powerful energy was being emitted from Sooah&#x2019;s body.</span></p><p><span style="">She was barely able to keep her eyes open, but her ghastly visage no longer belonged to Sooah.</span></p><p><span style="">[The time of our destiny has arrived.]</span></p><p><span style="">Her small mouth stood still, yet a sound rang inside everyone&#x2019;s head. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What time is she talking about?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">[&#x2026;&#x2026;.]</span></p><p><span style="">There was no answer to Minchan&#x2019;s question.</span></p><p><span style="">It was always like this. &#xA0;She only spoke what she wanted to say,</span></p><p><span style="">[It might be the start of a change, or the bridle may be put on us again&#x2026;..]</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;&#x2026;.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Since there was no point in speaking to her, everyone stayed silent as they listened. &#xA0;They just recorded her words, so Kahng-woojin could be informed of her words.</span></p><p><span style="">[&#x2026;&#x2026;.]</span></p><p><span style="">Sooah&#x2019;s body had been floating up in the air, but now she was slowly descending to the floor. &#xA0;Bibi lifted her, and she carefully stroked Sooah&#x2019;s cheek.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Poor thing.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">She was her master&apos;s dongsaeng.</span></p><p><span style="">Why did the god of earth pick Sooah? &#xA0;She was still very young.</span></p><p><span style="">Bibi looked to be the same age as Sooah, but she was a demon. &#xA0;She had lived over 200 years as a succubus.</span></p><p><span style="">She couldn&#x2019;t help, but pity Sooah. &#xA0;She felt for her.</span></p><p><span style="">At that moment, Bibi&#x2019;s slightly wet eyes opened wide from surprise.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Miss Bibi? &#xA0;What&#x2019;s wrong?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Minchan questioned her in surprise, but Bibi extended his hand towards him. &#xA0;She stopped him from approaching.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Uh uh&#x2026;.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">She let out an exclamation as her body started to twist.</span></p><p><span style="">Pah-pah-paht!</span></p><p><span style="">Her arms and legs exploded.</span></p><p><span style="">Instead of fragments of blood&#x2026; &#xA0;Various parts of her body exploded into black smoke.</span></p><p><span style="">Hwah-roo-rook.</span></p><p><span style="">When she was completely returned to being a cloud of black smoke, it started to coalesce again. &#xA0;She was completely different from before. &#xA0;She was taller and her body was bigger.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ah ah.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">It was as if Bibi was unsummoned before being summoned again. </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Huhk.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ooh uhk.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Instead of the unconscious Sooah, Minchan and Jaemin let out shocked exclamation at Bibi&#x2019;s changed appearance.</span></p><p><span style="">She had slim legs that extended for days. &#xA0;Alongside her increased height, her breasts and butt grew bigger&#x2026;. &#xA0;She still had her cute face, but her appearance almost made her look inhuman.</span></p><p><span style="">Bibi had a different type of beauty compared to the Holy Maiden Melody. &#xA0;She was oozing with sex appeal.</span></p><p><span style="">Moreover, a slim black tail extended out from her backside&#x2026;.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hah.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">One couldn&#x2019;t tell if you was letting out a exclamation or a moan. &#xA0;She let out a restless noise as she puffed out her cheeks.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;This will be troublesome.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style=""> Even her voice sounded seductive. &#xA0;It was as if her voice was melting the ears of the men around her. &#xA0;Minchan and Jaemin didn&#x2019;t even think about turning their heads away. &#xA0;Their faces were beet red.</span></p><p><span style="">Bibi turned to look at the two.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Jeez. &#xA0;Stop looking at the two of us like that. &#xA0;We are in a troublesome situation too. &#xA0;Holy crap.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;We are in trouble.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">At Bibi&#x2019;s words, the two men mumbled to themselves as if their souls had been bewitched.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Everything is bigger&#x2026;.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;</span><span style="">Oh, say can you see. &#xA0;By the dawn&apos;s early light</span><span style="">&#x2026;.&#x201D;</span><sub>1</sub></p><p><span style="">The two men continued to mumble to themselves as if they weren&#x2019;t of sound mind yet. &#xA0;Bibi furrowed her brows as she looked at them.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Please come to your senses!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Uh-yoohk.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Huhk.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">She spoke with a serious expression on her face.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;It seems earth has finished going through its synchronization.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Minchan replied with a question. &#xA0;Bibi still had on a serious expression as she turned to look at the unconscious Sooah.</span></p><p><span style="">So was this the time of destiny mentioned by earth&#x2019;s god?</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;The Dimensional Gates will now be wide open.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;&#x2026;.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Minchan and Jaemin also put on a serious expression. &#xA0;Even now the Dimensional lords were appearing quite frequently. &#xA0;If the Dimensional gates was thrown wide open&#x2026;.</span></p><p><span style="">If the earlier attacks were exploratory attacks, the attacks from now on will be&#x2026;.</span></p><p><span style="">The real war was about to start now.</span></p><p><span style="">***</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Block them!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ggooh-ahhhhk.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Too-doo-doo-doo-doo.</span></p><p><span style="">The hail of bullets were shot as the brave Roused charged forward. &#xA0;They died in an ill-advised manner. &#xA0;Their enemies were powerful, and they had all show up on the world at the same time.</span></p><p><span style="">It was the 2nd Dungeon Shock.</span></p><p><span style="">It was the name coined by the media of the world, &#xA0;and it described the incidents that were occurring daily. &#xA0;However, it wasn&#x2019;t a topic of conversation any more.</span></p><p><span style="">There were places where tens of thousands of people were being killed, and the odd phenomena of an entire city being vaporized into nothing had occurred.</span></p><p><span style="">The entirety of earth was in chaos.</span></p><p><span style="">The owners of businesses and the upper crust of society had already evacuated to several regions that were considered to be safe zones. &#xA0;It was ironic that these people evacuated to third world countries, who possessed no subway stations.</span></p><p><span style="">Was clearing Dungeons the safer option?</span></p><p><span style="">The Dungeons were reset several dozen times a day, and the Roused couldn&#x2019;t continuously attempt to clear them. &#xA0;&#xA0;It only took a single day for Dimensional lords to appear at these unkept Dungeons.</span></p><p><span style="">Moreover, it wasn&#x2019;t just the Dimensional lords. &#xA0;There were the Dungeon owners and the Dimensional refugees appearing on earth. &#xA0;A problem that arose from these events was the fact that not all of these beings were monsters.</span></p><p><span style="">There were races that looked exactly like humans. &#xA0;Even the Dimensional refugee classified as humanoid were mixing into the population of earth.</span></p><p><span style="">The previous Dungeon Shock couldn&#x2019;t be compared to this current great catastrophe.</span></p><p><span style="">In a situation where it was hard to tell, who should be helped or not, Bibi&#x2019;s Castle arrived in the skies of London.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Are the British government still unresponsive towards our request?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;They want us to wait. &#xA0;They&#x2019;ll allow us entry soon.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">He zoomed in on the surface with cameras, and he could see the situation beneath was very bad.</span></p><p><span style="">It was hellish.</span></p><p><span style="">It was unknown as to how many Dungeon Breaks had occurred, but there seemed to be more monsters than humans below. &#xA0;London was a lawless land now.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hoo-ooh. &#xA0;Hurry up...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">They had come here to find Kim-kahngchul, but that problem was inconsequential now. &#xA0;The solving of the Moon World&#x2019;s secret was a moot point if the entire earth fell into ruins.</span></p><p><span style="">No, earth wouldn&#x2019;t fall to ruins. &#xA0;The population would be eradicated&#x2026;.</span></p><p><span style="">The core members of Alandal were gathered in the control room, and they were still waiting for permission from the British government.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Uh?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Uh?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Bibi and Do-jaemin simultaneously let out an exclamation.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What&#x2019;s wrong?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Master is back.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;H...hyung-nim.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">As soon as he returned to his Dimensional Domain, Woojin sent messages to his vassals.</span></p><p><span style="">[How&#x2019;s earth doing? &#xA0;If it isn&#x2019;t busy over there, I want to gather some Points in Alandal.]</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;It is busy. &#xA0;Earth is in trouble.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Master. &#xA0;The Synchronization was completed.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">He heard the two voices simultaneously, and Woojin became silent. </span></p><p><span style="">[Is it bad?]</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes! &#xA0;The Dungeons are continuously Breaking all over the world. &#xA0;People are being evacuated to regions without any subway stations.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">[Where are you guys?]</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;We are at London.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">[I&#x2019;ll be heading over there.]</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes. &#xA0;Please hurry.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Jung-minchan wasn&apos;t able to hear Woojin&#x2019;s voice, so he reacted when he heard Do-jaemin&#x2019;s words. &#xA0;Jung-minchan answered with a pale face.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;If the king comes this way, what&#x2019;ll happen to the employees dispatched at the Seoul Station?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ah!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Do-jaemin immediately updated the situation, and Woojin asked a question in response.</span></p><p><span style="">[Who&#x2019;s there?]</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Chief secretary Woo went there. &#xA0;He wanted to improve upon the relationship with Korea&#x2026;.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">[Ah. &#xA0;That guy is always quite troublesome.]</span></p><p><span style="">After mulling over it for a short time, Woojin gave an answer.</span></p><p><span style="">[I&#x2019;ll go to Seoul. &#xA0;I want you guys to kill all the monsters over there.]</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;The British government hasn&#x2019;t given us permission to enter&#x2026;.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">At Jaemin&#x2019;s words, Woojin didn&#x2019;t even have to think about his answer.</span></p><p><span style="">[You have my permission. &#xA0;Go.]</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes, hyung&#xFF0C;&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Jaemin no longer heard Woojin&#x2019;s voice. &#xA0;He turned around, and everyone was focused on him.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;He wants us to kill them all.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Jung-minchan immediately turned on the control room&#x2019;s microphone.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Wyvern Units. &#xA0;Get ready to deploy! &#xA0;Ready the cannons!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The heads of the cannons started to extend out from the floor of the flying fortress, and they started pointing towards the surface.</span></p><p>Notes:</p><p></p><ol><p></p><p></p><li>Jaemin
