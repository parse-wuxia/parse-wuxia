<p><span style="">Chapter 162 - Bibi&apos;s Castle</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes. They&apos;ll all be safe.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Woojin was very serious about this subject.</span></p><p><span style="">While he was out in the battlefield, he had to believe that his family was safe. &#xA0;It wasn&apos;t just about his workers. &#xA0;Woojin&apos;s mother and Sooah would be here.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What happened to Kim-kahngchul?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;He completely fell off the radar.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Tsk.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">The bastard will someday try to contact him again. &#xA0;Woojin didn&apos;t need to put much effort into catching him. &#xA0;He had more important tasks to accomplish.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;When is the guild general assembly?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;It is scheduled to be at 7 at night.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;We still have a lot of time left.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">It was a little bit past 9 in the morning. &#xA0;There was quite a lot of time left until dinner.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ah. &#xA0;The aircraft carrier is anchored at the Busan Port.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Woojin had been heading towards Alandal, but he stopped walking.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Already?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes. &#xA0;However...&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What? Is there a problem?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;We&apos;ve sent employee ahead to receive it at Busan, but it seems the aircraft carrier is not in a good state.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;So they gave me an old one.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">The aircraft carrier was going to be put out of commission about 5 years ago, but the UK lent it out to India when they asked for its use. &#xA0;In Alandal&#x2019;s deal, this same aircraft carrier was sent to Korea.</span></p><p><span style="">Jung-minchan had a slightly seriously expression on his face, and he carefully spoke to Woojin.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;If you don&apos;t like it, I&apos;ll renegotiate the deal.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;It&apos;s all right. &#xA0;Can it move?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I&apos;m asking if it can sail.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;It can sail, but....&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Then it&apos;s fine.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Woojin didn&apos;t care about types of weapons mounted on it or what was given along with the deal.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;The deck of the ship is in rough shape, and it&apos;ll cost us a lot of money to mount more weapons on it. &#xA0;Moreover, we&apos;ll need to hire people to operate it. &#xA0;The convoy ships were also excluded from this contract. &#xA0;If we want to make a decent fleet, we&apos;ll have to spend two to three times the money....&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I don&apos;t need that stuff.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">What would an aircraft carrier be without aircrafts and convoy ships?</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Then it would basically be a really big boat that can move....&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;That&apos;s the most important part.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#xB7;&#xB7;&#xB7;&#xB7;&#xB7;&#xB7;?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I want a ground that moves.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I&apos;ll be back before 6.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Woojin headed towards Alandal&#x2019;s Safari. &#xA0;He headed towards the nest of the Wyverns.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;W...where are you going?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I&apos;m going to go tidy up our new house.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#xB7;&#xB7;&#xB7;&#xB7;&#xB7;&#xB7;?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Did he hear wrong? </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Slowly, get everyone ready to move.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;A...are you perhaps&#xB7;&#xB7;&#xB7;.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Woojin grinned as he got on top of a Wyvern.</span></p><p><span style="">Kee-ahhhhhk! </span></p><p><span style="">The Wyvern pushed off forcefully against the ground with Woojin on it. &#xA0;When Woojin was far into the distance, the surprised Baek-jungdo approached Jung-minchan.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Prime Minister Jung. &#xA0;Where is brother Kahng going?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#xB7;&#xB7;&#xB7;he said he was going to go claim the aircraft carrier.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Jung-minchan opened his smart phone, and he called Kim-haemin, who was already down in Busan.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Haemin-ah. &#xA0;The president just left towards your direction.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">[Ah. &#xA0;Is that so? &#xA0;When is he getting here? &#xA0;Which route is he taking?] </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;He is riding the Wyvern over there.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">[What? &#xA0;Then where should I go greet....] </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ughh. You can take care of everything.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">[P...Prime Minister-nim?] </span></p><p><span style="">Jung-minchan ended the call, and he looked at the people around him.</span></p><p><span style="">The new employees were talking to their family, and the reporters across the gate was taking pictures. &#xA0;Then there was Baek-jungdo and Do-jaemin, who had come here in a moment of confusion. </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;So have you seen Mr. Sunggoo anywhere? &#xA0;I haven&apos;t seen him.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ah. &#xA0;Sunggoo hyung still has some training left to do.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">He nodded his at Do-jaemin&#x2019;s words. &#xA0;Sunggoo was able to solo clear a 6 star Dungeon, so he didn&#x2019;t have to be too worried about Sunggoo.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Sunggoo hyung might die.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#xB7;&#xB7;&#xB7;Planet Jaku is that dangerous?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;No. &#xA0;Jaenis-nim and Sunggoo hyung is playing hide and seek over there.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Why the heck would they be playing hide and seek...</span></p><p><span style="">Do-jaemin left behind the puzzled Jung-minchan.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I&apos;ll go see my sister.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Oh my. &#xA0;You guys just came back from the battlefield, yet I&apos;m holding you guys up.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Usually, when Roused comes back from a Dungeon Exploration, they were high strung. &#xA0;Recently, Jung-minchan had been supporting Kahng-woojin and Hong-sunggoo, so he had forgotten about this fact.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hurry up and go rest. &#xA0;Also, you can move around during the day now?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Jaemin grinned.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Well, I&#x2019;ll be a bit lethargic, but it won&apos;t kill me. &#xA0;Not any more, heh heh.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">He was a Vampire Lord.</span></p><p><span style="">He was a noble amongst nobles now. &#xA0;His existence itself was too esteemed for him to die from the curse of the sun.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I&apos;ll have to go too, if I want to participate in tonight&apos;s general assembly.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes. &#xA0;I&apos;ve already contacted KH, so they will be here soon.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">After sending off Baek-jungdo, Minchan furrowed his brows. </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ha-ah. We are moving?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Minchan knew Woojin&apos;s personality. &#xA0;He brought to fruition anything he said, so their move was basically guaranteed. &#xA0;There were 1000 family members living here, and Minchan&apos;s head hurt just from thinking about moving them.</span></p><p><span style="">*** </span></p><p><span style="">They were in the control tower of the aircraft carrier, Invincible, which was anchored at Busan.</span></p><p><span style="">Kim-haemin looked down at the decks.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hmmm. Is this bigger them the ROKS Dokdo?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes. &#xA0;It is a little bit larger.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">He nodded his head when he heard the words of the specialist that had joined the Alandal city state recently.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;It if it this short, will we be able to launch planes into the air....&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;It doesn&apos;t matter. &#xA0;I thought our state didn&apos;t have any pilots?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;We could just hire them.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;If it is a vertical takeoff and landing aircraft, it might be possible... &#xA0;Can&apos;t we just stick to using the helicopters?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Currently, there were 15 helicopters placed atop the deck. </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I don&apos;t know. &#xA0;I&apos;m not sure what he wants to do... &#xA0;Uh whew. We bought it, but I have no idea of their uses.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;We have to quickly hire the right personnel.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Kim-haemin let out a sigh. &#xA0;The crew had exited before they were able to claim ownership of the aircraft carrier. &#xA0;It was the property of Britain, but it had been used by India for the past 5 years.</span></p><p><span style="">Since they&apos;ve finished their duty, they were heading back to India. &#xA0;If there was a problem, the crew told Haemin to take it up with the British government.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What the hell is this? &#xA0;Is this supposed to be some form of a fuck you?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Haemin had quickly come to Busan with 30 members of Alandal.</span></p><p><span style="">How long would it take for them to gather enough people to actually get this aircraft carrier moving?</span></p><p><span style="">They would have to replace the weapons, which was old by several generations. &#xA0;Moreover, they would have to purchase the convoy fleet, and the deck had to be redone.....</span></p><p><span style="">He didn&apos;t get why a small country like Alandal needed an aircraft carrier.</span></p><p><span style="">Ggee-ahhhhhhhk. </span></p><p><span style="">At the monster&apos;s roar, the surprised Haemin looked around his surrounding.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;The king is here. &#xA0;Let us go out.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes, director.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">When they descended the control tower, they saw a Wyvern lightly land on the deck. &#xA0;Woojin jumped off from the saddle. &#xA0;Haemin quickly ran towards him as he waved his hand.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;How did you know it was this one?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Didn&apos;t you say it was the biggest boat here?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#xB7;&#xB7;&#xB7;&#xB7;&#xB7;&#xB7;.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Woojin saw a man arrive with Haemin. &#xA0;When Woojin looked at him, the man bowed towards him.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;This is Park-gilsoo. &#xA0;He used to be a lieutenant commander. &#xA0;When he was an officer, he was dispatched to an aircraft carrier for 6 months.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Oh. &#xA0;An experienced person.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Woojin shook his hand.</span></p><p><span style="">The rest of the employees came running towards them, and Haemin introduced all of them.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;These three here has helicopter pilot licenses.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Helicopters?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Woojin took a peek at the helicopters.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Will we ever use it?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">He guessed he could give it to Dolsae, but he couldn&apos;t think of any other uses for them.</span></p><p><span style="">Haemin&apos;s eyes turned round.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What? &#xA0;If you don&apos;t want helicopters, are you planning to purchase the vertical takeoff and landing aircrafts?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Vertical take off and landing aircraft?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Woojin slightly turned his head to look at the Wyvern that had been calmly sitting on the deck. &#xA0;It was as big as a fighter jet or a helicopter. &#xA0;There were Wyverns that was much bigger than this one, and it wouldn&#x2019;t be a problem for several people to ride it.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I have one of them right here.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#xB7;&#xB7;&#xB7;&#xB7;&#xB7;&#xB7;.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">He had never thought about this possibility. &#xA0;Wyverns on the aircraft carriers...</span></p><p><span style="">That didn&apos;t sound like a bad idea.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I think that&apos;ll be an appropriate location.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">When Woojin headed towards the control tower, Haemin and Gilsoo followed after him.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I&apos;ll give you a tour.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;No. &#xA0;It&apos;s all right.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Woojin didn&apos;t go into the control tower. &#xA0;He just stood in front of it.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I hope this works.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Woojin took out a Dimensional Fragment from his Inventory. &#xA0;He didn&apos;t know the prerequisites needed to form a Colony. &#xA0;However, he knew the other Dimensional lords had done it, so it was possible for him to do it.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Why won&apos;t it work?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">He stared at his Dimensional Fragment for a long time, and nothing happened. &#xA0;Woojin took out another one. &#xA0;If this didn&apos;t work, he planned on combining three Dimensional Fragments to make a Dimensional Proof.</span></p><p><span style="">When he held two Dimensional Fragments in one hand, he heard a familiar voice.</span></p><p><span style="">&lt;Will you combine two Dimensional Fragments to for a Dimensional Shard?&gt; </span></p><p><span style="">It seemed he had found the easy way to do this. &#xA0;Woojin combined the two Dimensional Fragments to make a Dimensional Shard. &#xA0;It looked like a long crystal pagoda. &#xA0;The Dimensional Shard was about the size of a small wand.</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin embedded it into the control tower.</span></p><p><span style="">&lt;Will you form a Colony?&gt; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Of course.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Light leaked out of the Dimensional Shard, and as if it was a projector, several symbolic icons appeared as holograms. &#xA0;The pictures started to flip before it came to a stop on a tree symbol.</span></p><p><span style="">&lt;There is a restriction on the types of symbolic icons that can be formed on Earth.&gt; </span></p><p><span style="">Who cares on what it looks like? The important part was the fact that he&apos;ll be able to create a Colony on a moveable aircraft carrier.</span></p><p><span style="">&lt;The Dimensional lord Kahng-woojin&apos;s Colony City will be created. &#xA0;There is 24 hours...&gt; </span></p><p><span style="">As the Dimensional shard let out a light, a tree started to grow. &#xA0;The Dimensional Shard acted as a seed. &#xA0;It was like the Jack and the Beanstalk. &#xA0;In a flash, the tree vines grew as it surrounded the control tower.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Uh uh?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Haemin and the employees, who had been watching, became surprised at the sight.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Don&apos;t let anyone touch it for a day.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#xB7;&#xB7;&#xB7;yes. &#xA0;So what the heck is this?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What do you think it is? &#xA0;It is our new home.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">The vine-like roots had completely surrounded the control tower, and the tree was starting to grow slowly. &#xA0;Woojin looked at it with a satisfied smile on his face.</span></p><p><span style="">A Dungeon and a Colony allowed him to use his full power as a Dimensional lord. &#xA0;Anything was possible through using the Points. &#xA0;Of course, it had to be within the sphere of influence of the symbolic icon.</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin would basically be akin to a god in this place.</span></p><p><span style="">If one wanted to travel through his Portal to his Dimensional Domain, one had to be a Roused.. &#xA0;However, the Colony City created on a planet can be accessed by almost anyone.</span></p><p><span style="">It was a place where Alandal&apos;s family members would stay. &#xA0;They would be staying in a powerful Colony City protected by the power of a Dimensional lord.</span></p><p><span style="">In one day, it would be possible to move this powerful fortress city after its creation. </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Shall we start the cleaning it first?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">The deck was large, but it felt small if one was thinking about building a city on top of it.</span></p><p><span style="">Weeeeng </span></p><p><span style="">When Dolsae was summoned, Woojin looked at Haemin.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;How many helicopter pilots did you say we have?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Three.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I guess we don&apos;t need the rest.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">After being summoned, Dolsae acted as Woojin willed. &#xA0;It charged towards the helicopters.</span></p><p><span style="">Zzooohng, koo-koohng! </span></p><p><span style="">The steel plates on the helicopters were crumpled, and it coalesced to form an Iron Golem. &#xA0;In the corner of the deck, a pile of crushed old metals were starting to form.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#xB7;&#xB7;&#xB7;&#xB7;&#xB7;&#xB7;.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Those were very expensive..... &#xA0;If Woojin was just going to move it to the side, Haemin could have sold it instead.</span></p><p><span style="">Haemin&apos;s lips became drier as Dolsae cleared away the helicopters one by one.</span></p><p><span style="">*** </span></p><p><span style="">Jejudo Island&apos;s Manjang cave.</span></p><p><span style="">There was a magic circle drawn on the flat ground, and it was letting out a bright light. &#xA0;The magical energy of the Bloodstones placed in various locations around the cave was feeding it. &#xA0;Moreover, this had been going on for the past couple days.</span></p><p><span style="">When the magic circle&apos;s light disappeared, a portal was formed.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Finally.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">Lee-sahngho knelt in front of the portal.</span></p><p><span style="">The Hwarang guild members took notice, so they knelt alongside Lee-sahngho. &#xA0;They lowered their heads.</span></p><p><span style="">Zee-ahhhhng. </span></p><p><span style="">The Portal rippled, and Iello appeared.</span></p><p><span style="">[Hmmmm.] </span></p><p><span style="">The cave was dark and dank. &#xA0;This was why he liked it.</span></p><p><span style="">[You are pretty useful.] </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;It is an honor.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Iello could feel that the light from magic circle had spread throughout the cave, and now he had control over this location. &#xA0;Lee-sahngho had made a foothold, where he would be able to safely materialize on earth.</span></p><p><span style="">He had gained a Dungeon that would directly connect earth to his Dimensional domain.</span></p><p><span style="">Iello didn&apos;t immediately start his takeover of earth.</span></p><p><span style="">[Bring me the information regarding the Immortal.] </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I will carry out your order.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Lee-sahngho and his underlings carefully exited the cave.</span></p><p><span style="">Iello was careful, and he had humans of earth, who could carry out his orders.</span></p><p><span style="">[Earth.] </span></p><p><span style="">Iello was still not synchronized with earth. &#xA0;It was unfortunate that he couldn&apos;t use 100% of his power. &#xA0;However, as time passed on this planet, magical energy would become abundant.</span></p><p><span style="">He didn&apos;t feel down about it. &#xA0;He felt incredibly happy.</span></p><p><span style="">[Has It returned?] </span></p><p><span style="">It was the planet that had been sealed away for so long.</span></p><p><span style="">He had returned to the starting point.</span></p>
