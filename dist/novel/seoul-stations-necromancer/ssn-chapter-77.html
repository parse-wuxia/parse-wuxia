He died because of me?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;&#x2026;.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Did I really do that?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">He propped his chin on one hand. The Holy Maiden tried to help him recall the memory.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;The Death Knight&#x2026;.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ah, Kiba did it.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin vaguely remembered it. He needed a branch from the World Tree, so he had visited the forest of the elves. Anyways, he had opened up the way by using the Death Knight and his Undead army.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Jeez. He could have just given me a branch.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;It&apos;s their mission&#x2026;.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;N...nothing.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">If he had only wanted a single branch from the World tree in the first place, the Elves would have given it to him. However, he had wanted to uproot the entire tree, so they couldn&apos;t standby and allow him to do so.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What about the Great Scholar? What was his name? Noting...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;The Great Scholar Nauteus died from an old chronic disease...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;&#x2026;.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin decided he didn&apos;t need to ask what had caused the chronic disease. It would just make the situation needlessly more awkward.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ah, it&apos;s all right. Why are you looking at me like that?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;&#x2026;.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Jung-minchan was looking at Woojin with glazed eyes, which drew some ire from Woojin. After giving a fake cough, Minchan carefully asked his question.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hmm. It seems that president had been a little bit rough?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ah&#x2026;.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The Holy Maiden let out an exclamation. How great would it have been if he was just a bit rough? This guy mildly characterized the Immortal&apos;s actions as just a little bit rough. This bastard was also part of Alandal.</span></p><p><span style="">He was tremendously evil. The Holy Melody decided to memorize Jung-minchan&apos;s face.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I guess I was a little bit.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;&#x2026;.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The Holy Maiden swallowed the words she was about to say when Woojin cooly acknowledged that fact. She didn&apos;t want to respond in vain.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Still, you should at least remember the name of the deceased...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">There was a brittle atmosphere between the Holy Maiden and Woojin, so Minchan said it just for the sake of saying it. However, Woojin rebuked him in a serious manner.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hey, Minchan. Do you remember the English words you learned when you were in elementary school?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;That&apos;s&#x2026;.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">How could he remember the several hundred to several thousand English vocabulary? No, in the first place...</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I learned it in middle school instead of elementary school. Also, I didn&apos;t learn any English at all...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">It felt as if they were getting off-topic...</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes. It would have been great if I hadn&apos;t have to do what I did.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;&#x2026;.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin spoke the truth.</span></p><p><span style="">In the beginning, he had killed in self-defense. Afterwards, he became desensitised to killing.</span></p><p><span style="">He didn&apos;t have some tremendous talent that allowed him to stand still like an idiot while his enemies aimed for his life.</span></p><p><span style="">He wasn&apos;t a pacifist like Ghandi.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;This topic is making my mood sour&#x2026;.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Melody shook like a leaf at Woojin&apos;s words.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Please calm your wrath...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ah, no.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Why did this woman keep shaking at every word he said? Maybe she thought he plan on killing her? It wasn&apos;t as if he had a reason to kill someone who hadn&apos;t meant him ill...</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin frowned.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;So what were you talking about before?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;what do you mean?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Weren&apos;t you inciting the guys into invading Alphen?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;&#x2026;.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Do want to die?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The Holy Maiden&apos;s face turned white.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;If you took all the Roused on earth to Alphen, they will die a dog&apos;s death over there. Then what will happen to Earth? You should already know the Dungeons will Break eventually regardless of what we do. Who is going to defend earth at that time?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">This was the one piece of truth she hadn&apos;t revealed. It made the Holy Maiden&apos;s face turn pale. She couldn&apos;t underestimate Woojin just because he was laughing. She didn&apos;t know what that face was capable of doing.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Are you declaring war against me?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Absolutely not!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The Holy Maiden once again threw her body to the floor.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Stop bowing your head and sit. Give me a proper explanation.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;There is a way we can stop the Dungeon Breaks.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I&apos;m liking the sound of this.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">If they could stop the Dungeon Break at the Source, then he didn&apos;t care if Alphen was used as the battlefield.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Speak.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;If you possessed a Dimensional Domain, you could take over the nearby Dungeons one by one. When you gain ownership of the Dungeons, the monsters won&apos;t be able to head outside without the express intent of the lord.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Mmmm? This is the first time I&apos;m hearing about this.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Trahnet&apos;s seventy-two commanders are the Great Lords. There are also numerous lords underneath them.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Is that so?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;You didn&apos;t know about this?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Is it something I should have known about?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The Holy Maiden made an expression as if someone had shit in her mouth. Why was it so hard for her to maintain her composure in front of the Immortal?</span></p><p><span style="">So why did Alandal fight Trahnet in the past? What had he been fighting for?</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I fought him because he stepped on my land.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;&#x2026;.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">When she looked back at her memories of the Immortal, he killed anyone who had invaded his territory. It didn&apos;t matter if the enemy was Trahnet or the alliance. He had invaded his opponents as a form of retaliation. However, he had never seized or occupied the other territories.</span></p><p><span style="">Quite literally, he only took his revenge. He only demolished and plundered them.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Currently, earth only had empty Dungeons. The low rank Dungeons are farmlands. The lords would be tempted by the high rank Dungeons, but the Great Lords won&apos;t be satisfied with just the high rank Dungeons.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The low rank Dungeons were 1~3 stars, and the high rank Dungeons were 4~6 stars.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;The moment when the highest Dungeon is formed, they will fix their eyes on earth.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hmmm.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin tapped his fingers on the armrest of his chair.</span></p><p><span style="">It was as he had predicted. When the 7 star Dungeons starts to crop up, Trahnet&apos;s commanders will show up.</span></p><p><span style="">The Holy Maiden knew much more about Trahnet than him. She also knew how the enemy&apos;s enormous forces were structured.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;So why do the Dungeon Breaks happen?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;It is a process to synchronize with earth.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Synchronize?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The Holy Maiden calmed her voice, then she explained patiently.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;For example, a Dungeon with 30,000 Dungeon Energy is reset. If the Dungeon isn&apos;t cleared within the thirty days it takes for the Dungeon to synchronize, it&apos;ll break. The monsters will run havoc on earth, and the mana equivalent of 30,000 Energy will be spread across earth.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;So what happens when the Dungeon is cleared before the thirty days is up?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;It turns into a well-behaved Mine to provide bloodstones. When the amount of bloodstones excavated reach the amount of 30,000 Energy, the Dungeon will reset. In the end, the excavated bloodstones will increase the mana on earth equivalent to 30,000 Energy.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;So it is impossible to stop it. Eventually Earth will change into something akin to Alphen?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes&#x2026;.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;And the Dungeon Break?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;When there is enough mana on earth, and the synchronization process isn&apos;t needed, the thirty days become obsolete&#x2026;.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;&#x2026;.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Basically, the monsters would come out immediately after the Dungeon is reset.</span></p><p><span style="">It would be devastating.</span></p><p><span style="">The time need to clear the Dungeon won&apos;t be there any more. The more serious problem would be the lack of time the locals would have to evacuate.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Without a doubt, when the Dungeons are opened, there will be a mass confusion before everything collapses.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;&#x2026;.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The entire earth will fall into a state of panic.</span></p><p><span style="">The Holy Maiden let out a secret sigh when she saw Woojin accepting her words. This was the information she had also given to the Titan Guild master.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;All right. Let&apos;s say we can block the Dungeon Break if we own the Dungeons. So why do we have to go to Alphen?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The Holy Maiden swallowed her saliva. When the Dimensional Domain was established, earth&apos;s Dungeons could be placed within the Domain. The Dungeon Break won&apos;t happen since the Dungeons would follow the will of the being that owned them.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;The Dimensional Domain can be stolen once again.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ho-oh?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin showed a reaction to those words.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;If one wants to keep it, one has to become stronger, and...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The Holy Maiden&apos;s voice continued.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Alphen will become the best hunting ground to do so.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Earth will eventually be filled with Mana. Afterwards, where will earth procure the Energy?</span></p><p><span style="">Alphen could be the alternative.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;That&apos;s sound pretty reasonable.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The Holy Maiden internally sighed at Woojin&apos;s reaction.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;If we steal all the Domains from Trahnet&apos;s underlings, they&apos;ll basically be unemployed?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;&#x2026;.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">As expected of the Immoral. He thought about taking instead of protecting first. His reputation was well deserved.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin grinned at the Holy Maiden&apos;s reply.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;If I steal all of them, then I&apos;ll finally be able to meet Trahnet, who has never shown himself before.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;&#x2026;.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The Holy Maiden kept silent when she heard Woojin&apos;s vicious plan.</span></p><p><span style="">Lies and truth exist in one place, as they are two sides of the same coin.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;All right. Then tell me how I&apos;ll be able to acquire a Dimensional Domain..&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;You can steal it&#x2026; Or you can personally declare one. Both options requires a gem called the Dimensional Fragment...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin took out a bright purple gem from his inventory.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;W...where did you get that?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I picked it up.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;&#x2026;.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What do I do with it?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Only one Dimensional Fragment is needed to steal a Dungeon. However, Immortal doesn&apos;t have a Dimensional Domain right now. You will need 3 Dimensional Fragment to declare your first Domain.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I can go to any Dungeon?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;You have to be chosen by a Dungeon.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Why is the process so particular?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The Holy Maiden bowed her head.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;There will be specific Dungeons that will react to each Dimensional Fragment.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hmmm. So I need three of them?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin returned the Dimensional Fragment into his Inventory.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Give me two.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;&#x2026;.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The Holy Maiden&apos;s expression stiffened.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Since you aren&apos;t saying anything, it seems you do have them.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;&#x2026;.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The Holy Maiden couldn&apos;t lie. Woojin grinned as he put his hand out.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I&apos;ll pay you back. Give it to me.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I&apos;m only lending you one.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The Holy Maiden was planning on using it to open a Dungeon on Earth. If Woojin snatched it away from her, she...</span></p><p><span style="">Still, it wasn&apos;t as if she had a choice in giving it to him or not.</span></p><p><span style="">The Holy Maiden took out a single Dimensional Fragment from her sub-dimension. Woojin suddenly made a grab for it.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Let go of it.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;I really paid a lot to obtain this.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">How much blood had she spilled to earn this? The surviving people of Alphen was waiting for her&#x2026;</span></p><p><span style="">She had to obtain a Dungeon on earth. Then through the Dimensional Domain, she was going to open a way to Alphen.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I know. I&apos;ll pay it back. Give it.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;You really have to return it to me.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Do you want it stolen? Or do you want to lend it to me?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The Holy Maiden released her strength from her hand. Woojin quickly took the item, and he laughed as he put it away.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;So we just have to find a Dungeon that&apos;ll react to it?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;&#x2026;.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">How could he be so excited when this matter decided the life or death of an entire planet?</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin kept asking various questions about the Dimensional Domain. While he was asking his questions, a being slipped suddenly into his shadow. Woojin&apos;s body shuddered.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;What is it?&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin used his inner consciousness to ask the question. Ggaebi, who had returned to his shadow, spoke in a somber voice.</span></p><p><span style="">[Master&#x2026; The Illusion Witch was captured.]</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;What? Bibi was captured?&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin was surprised. His familiars in his summoning room shared his senses. Dolsae was summoned even though Woojin hadn&apos;t called for him.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Aigo.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Minchan was surprised when Dolsae suddenly appeared. There was a bright light, and numerous small lights like fireflies flew around it. Dolsae was letting out a magical glow.</span></p><p><span style="">The light, which was basically Dolsae&apos;s body, shook uncontrollably.</span></p><p><span style="">[Weeeeeng.]</span></p><p><span style="">Dolsae was very close to Bibi, so he shook from worry. Woojin felt the same way as him.</span></p><p><span style="">How dare someone capture his familiar?</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Who did it?&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">[Trahnet&apos;s underling&#x2026; It was Rashmode. I escaped when the Illusion Witch was captured.]</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;You did well.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">Rashmode was one of the 72 commanders.</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin stood up abruptly from his seat.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I&apos;ll have to go first..&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;The response team isn&apos;t ready yet.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">He didn&apos;t have the time to wait for them.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Rashmode is here.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The Holy Maiden&apos;s eyes twinkled at Woojin&apos;s words.</span></p><p><span style="">Rashmode was one of the 72 commanders. Finally, the highest ranked Dungeon had opened on earth. If she could take over the Dungeon to make it her own...</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;My Dimensional Fragment was taken from me.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">Even if an opportunity was revealed in front of her eyes, she couldn&apos;t do anything about it.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Just gather the team as best as you can, then follow after me. The location&#x2026;&#x2026;.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin started explaining the pertinent information he had received from Ggaebi. He suddenly paused.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;There aren&apos;t any subway stations near there?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;&#x2026;.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin looked at the Holy Maiden, and his gaze was asking for an explanation from her.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;The s...synchronization...is drawing near.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin&apos;s expression broke into frown.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Follow me.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I do as the Monarch wishes...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin had a freezing atmosphere around his as if he was angry. The Holy Maiden carefully followed after him.</span></p><p></p></div><p></p>
