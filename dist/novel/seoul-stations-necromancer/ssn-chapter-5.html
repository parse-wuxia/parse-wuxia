He was currently at level 3. Every time he leveled up, he received 5 Stat Points and he distributed the 10 Stat Points into Magic and Control.</span></p><p><span style="">Magic : 15 Control :14</span></p><p><span style="">If he summoned 15 Skeleton Soldiers, he&#x2019;ll only be able to keep 14 of them. Once the Summons exceeds the range of his Control, they would turn into monsters beyond his control.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Wake up, my minions.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin had reached the pinnacle as a Necromancer. After being transported, he had to restart from a low level, but it was a path he had already walked. He didn&#x2019;t have to worry about Spells or Activation Words.</span></p><p><span style="">It was possible to manifest his familiars and mastered magics using just his will.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Koo-roo-roo.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">From nearby, the three corpses of the Drabbit exploded, and three Skeleton Soldiers was summoned. They were very weak, so he rarely used them in his latter-days. Still, he felt extremely happy to see them again.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Let&#x2019;s go.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">He still didn&#x2019;t have rear any support magic, but it would not be a problem with the Drabbits. Woojin and the three Skeleton Soldiers descended the stairs. It caused the Drabbits to run towards them in response.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Charge!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Keehhhhhhk!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The Skeleton Soldiers let out a horrible shriek, then they ran forward swinging their bone knives threateningly.</span></p><p><span style="">Puh-uk!</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Kee-ehk.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">One Skeleton Soldier fell into a heap from one blow as a Drabbit used a menacing head-butt. The others were lucky. They were only bitten on their arms and legs.</span></p><p><span style="">Since the Skeleton Soldiers were composed of bones, attacks using teeth weren&#x2019;t a threat. The Skeleton Soldiers were very weak, and their attack capabilities were insignificant. They swung their blunt bone knives, but it wasn&#x2019;t very effective against the Drabbits.</span></p><p><span style="">However, they had blocked the Drabbit&#x2019;s dangerous first charge, so they had done their job.</span></p><p><span style="">Puh-uk, puk!</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin swung his clawed hammer, and the Drabbit&#x2019;s heads continued to explode. In a flash, he had killed three Drabbits, and he used them as fodder to summon an additional three Skeleton Soldiers.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Kee-kee-keek.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">One had been demolished, but the number of Skeleton Soldiers had increased. The five Skeleton Soldier&#x2019;s reliably blocked in front of Woojin. Woojin used his will to control them as he advanced.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Kweeeehk!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">From between the broken windows of the subway train, Drabbits ran out en masse. There were so many of them that Woojin halted in his track for a moment.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Block them!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The 5 Skeleton Soldiers stood parallel to each other as if they were setting up a barricade.</span></p><p><span style="">Puh-puh-puk!</span></p><p><span style="">The Drabbits jumped at the Skeleton Soldiers like moths to a flame, and they started head-butting the Skeleton Soldiers&#x2019; limbs.</span></p><p><span style="">Puh-suk!</span></p><p><span style="">The middle Skeleton Soldier fell. One Drabbit broke through the line, and it flew accurately towards Woojin&#x2019;s head.</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin swung the clawed hammer like a clean-up hitter as it split the air.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;One more added!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The corpse of the Drabbit was flung away, and the corpse exploded to form another Skeleton Soldier.</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin headed towards the Drabbits tangled between the Skeleton Soldiers, and he brought down his clawed hammer as if he was threshing.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Die. Die!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Puh-puh-puk!</span></p><p><span style="">As he ended the Drabbit&#x2019;s lives, he intermittently summoned more Skeleton Soldiers.</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin had 15 Magical Points.</span></p><p><span style="">His Magical Points would become empty if he summoned 15 times. The Magical Points recovered naturally, but one could use items or Skills to recover it.</span></p><p><span style="">If he increased the [Recovery] stat, then his natural recovery of Magical Points quickened. For a Magician, the most important stats were Wisdom, Magic, and Recovery.</span></p><p><span style="">The stat [Healing] dealt with the natural recovery of his body. It increased the recovery speed of [Vitality], which was consumed when one used Healing Skills or Combat Skills.</span></p><p><span style="">This was the most important Stat for Warriors.</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin possessed 10 Stat Points on both Recovery and Healing. After a certain amount of time, the Recovery would restore 10 Magic Points, but the more important one was the 10 points in Healing.</span></p><p><span style="">After one day, a shallow wound would disappear without any scarring as it healed.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;All of you die!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">He trusted his healing power, so Woojin charged as he hefted his clawed hammer.</span></p><p><span style="">Boo-oong, puk! Boo-oong, Pul!</span></p><p><span style="">His movements already exceeded the limits of a human. Every time he swung his clawed hammer, a Drabbit died.</span></p><p><span style="">The couple dozen of Drabbits filling the subway station was defeated in a matter of moments.</span></p><p><span style="">When Woojin&#x2019;s reached level 4, his low Magical Points instantly recovered.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ha, I&#x2019;m so thirsty.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin looked around the station, which had turned into a field of Drabbit&#x2019;s corpses, and he headed towards the vending machine. He pried open the door of the already broken vending machine.</span></p><p><span style="">Kwajik.</span></p><p><span style="">He used his superhuman strength to create a gap between the vending machine&#x2019;s door, and couple cans came into sight. Woojin picked up a cola can, and he blew on top of it.</span></p><p><span style="">The accumulated dust flew into the air. It looked to be relatively intact, so it seemed like he could drink it.</span></p><p><span style="">Ddak. Cheeeeeek. (TLN: tab opening sfx, fizzing sfx)</span></p><p><span style="">When he opened the can, he gulped down the warm coke.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Kooahhh. Ggguhoooo.&#x201D; (TLN: sfx)</span></p><p><span style="">The fizzing gas made him belt out a satisfying burp. Woojin grinned.</span></p><p><span style="">He had defeated the monsters inside the subway station, which had turned into a dungeon. It almost made him think this was still Planet Alphen. However, the refreshing carbonated drink he hadn&#x2019;t had in 20 years made his return to earth very real to him.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I really have to go back home.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin&#x2019;s Magical Point had been restored, so he used the Search Skill.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Mmm.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Around the broken subway train&#x2019;s front car, he could see a sparkling soft light. When he approached it, he saw a finger-sized gem.</span></p><p><span style="">When Woojin grabbed the gem emitting a soft green light, the light dimmed.</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin carried the item back to where he came from. When he was close to the barrier, the Return Stone let out a light, and it scattered as it touched the barrier.</span></p><p><span style="">Che-che-choot.</span></p><p><span style="">After seeing the barrier disappear, Woojin went up the stairs of the Gwachun Station&#x2019;s 1st Exit.</span></p><p><span style="">*</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ooh ooh. I thought I was going to shit my pants.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Oh-joonhwan was a rank 9 public servant. After completing the assault, he had been assigned to the closed [Gwachun Station 1st Exit] dungeon as an Access Control Personnel. It had been one month since he was dispatched here.</span></p><p><span style="">He fulfilled the temporary reassignemnt period without any accidents happening.</span></p><p><span style="">He&#x2019;ll be going back to the headquarters tomorrow. After he hurriedly returned after using the restroom, it felt like the sky was about to fall.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What, what is this?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The locked Dungeon entrance door was open.</span></p><p><span style="">He felt dizzy, and the sky turned yellow.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;D..did a civilian go in? Ha, I&#x2019;m fucked.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">It was unlikely to think that a Roused had entered a closed Dungeon. The [Gwachun Station&#x2019;s 1st Exit] wasn&#x2019;t a Spot where particular ingredient items dropped. It was a just a dungeon infested by the low-ranked monster, Drabbit.</span></p><p><span style="">Unless it was a beginner Roused looking to train here, he couldn&#x2019;t think of a reason why someone would look for a dungeon that didn&#x2019;t drop anything of significance. It was hard to think a Roused would go into a location with no benefits.</span></p><p><span style="">Moreover, a Roused could just apply to enter the Dungeon in the first place. This was why he was assigned to this place.</span></p><p><span style="">He looked across the open entrance, and he was able to see that the barrier had already formed. It was a signal indicating someone was inside the dungeon.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ha, fuck. I&#x2019;ll have to quickly request for help.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">For the Roused, the Drabbits were classified as a low level monster, but it was a monster to civilians. Oh-joonhwan was about to quickly make a call, but the barrier became clouded and a man walked out.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Uh uh?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Before he could press the send button, Joonhwan&#x2019;s body froze. Woojin slowly walked out, and he was surprised when he met the gaze of Joonhwan.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ah, I opened the door and entered out of curiosit&#x2026;.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Are..are you a Roused?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">At Joonwan&#x2019;s question, Woojin puzzled over his words. Before he could speak, Joonhwan spoke quickly.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Whew. You almost took 10 years off my life. Please leave a record of your entrance. Whew. It&#x2019;s quite fortunate. Why did you go into a dungeon with nothing to gain? You cleared it as a Solo Player, so you must be quite strong.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">He passed over the Dungeon Entrance Record Log to Woojin. He half-assedly wrote down his name, and position. Then he kept his words scarce.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Why do you think I went in? I wanted to ride the subway home.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">He didn&#x2019;t have an explanation, so he thought it was best to stay silent. The other man was making up an excuse for him. After signing everything, Woojin confidently asked a question.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;May I go now?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ah, you can go now.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin turned around to ask a question after taking a couple steps. The 5 years wasn&#x2019;t a short of an amount of time as he initially thought since it seemed Dungeons and the Roused had come to be in that time period.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;How much is the bus fee these days?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">What the heck? He had heard almost all Roused were rich.</span></p><p></p></div><p></p>
