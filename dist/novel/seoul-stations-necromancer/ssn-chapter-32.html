<p><strong>Chapter 32 Do-jiwon (2).</strong></p><div id="chapterContent" class="innerContent fr-view"><p><span style="">Chapter 32 &#x2013; Do-jiwon (2)</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p><p><span style="">(<span>TLN: Hey guys~ I had some extra time, so I decided to translate another chapter. Please turn off the adblockers if you are able to. Thanks~)</span></span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;&#x2026;.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Sunggoo had a hard time moving moving his lips. Woojin didn&#x2019;t speak. However, it wasn&#x2019;t as if he stopped moving.</span></p><p><span style="">He grabbed a piece of beef entrails with his chopstick. He dipped it in the sauce, then he placed it on top of a perilla leaf. He also placed a garlic he had dipped in the soybean paste on top of it. Then Woojin emptied a glass of soju.</span></p><p><span style="">Crunch, crunch.</span></p><p><span style="">Wooijn smiled as he ate the wrapped meat.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ah. This really goes well as a side dish for the soju.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;&#x2026;.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin raised his empty glass towards Sunggoo, and he wordlessly filled the glass.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hey. Let&#x2019;s not do any games like this next time. How about we just quietly eat and drink alcohol?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;&#x2026;.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin brought the soju glass to his mouth when Sunggoo didn&#x2019;t give him an answer. When their eyes met, Sunggoo spoke.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hyung-nim.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Uh, what?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Why aren&#x2019;t you saying anything about it?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;About what?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Sunggoo glanced towards the passed out Do-jiwon, and he gave a meaningful gaze towards her.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What? Her bald spot?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;&#x2026;.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Wa. How could he say such words so easily?</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Dude. So what?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What&#x2019;s wrong with it?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;hyung-nim is ok with it?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What about it?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin emptied the soju into his mouth.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;She has a small scar. It isn&#x2019;t like she is going to die from it.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;&#x2026;.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">That wasn&#x2019;t what he meant.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What? Do you pity her?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Of course, wouldn&#x2019;t anyone feel sorry for her?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin grinned.</span></p><p><span style="">He had lived in Alphen where the wars were endless. He grew up in a world where it was normal to arm oneself if one wanted to survive.</span></p><p><span style="">Deformed appearance? Handicapped?</span></p><p><span style="">If one was able to run on one&#x2019;s own two legs, and one was able to grab a spear with both hands, then the person was considered to be a normal person.</span></p><p><span style="">From Woojin&#x2019;s perspective, Jiwon was just a woman with a scar on her head. She was Jaemin&#x2019;s noonah, and she was an alumni from 5 years ago.</span></p><p><span style="">Nothing had changed.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Pour me some more alcohol. I&#x2019;m in a good mood.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Sungoo didn&#x2019;t react to Woojin&#x2019;s words. Woojin was starting to frown, and it seemed he had drunk a lot of alcohol since his face had turned red.</span></p><p><span style="">Sunggoo mustered up his courage.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Once in a while, I am scared of hyung-nim. You are too cold-hearted.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ha.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">When Woojin became dumbfounded, Sunggoo suddenly stood up from his seat.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;If a woman hurts her face in Korea, it might be a fate worse than death!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Sunggoo flinched and he walked stiffly to the side. Then he exited the restaurant. Woojin still had his glass up in the air. He had a dumbfounded expression as he looked towards the restaurant&#x2019;s door where Sunggoo had exited.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ha-ah.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin put his glass down. He picked up a soju bottle then he poured it into the empty glass.</span></p><p><span style="">Ggol, ggol. (TLN: sfx soju pouring)</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I&#x2019;ll just fill it up myself.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin emptied another glass of soju, then he picked up some beef entrails. As he chewed, he glanced at Jiwon.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;So what?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Was it because he was used to dealing with the wild women of Alphen? If it was on Alphen, no woman would cover up a scar of that size from shame. Instead, they would show it off. It basically told everyone she had survived from the wounds received from the monsters.</span></p><p><span style="">Basically, it was a badge of honor.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I don&#x2019;t get why it&#x2019;s such a big deal. She&#x2019;s still pretty.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">She had a great body and a pretty face. A scar was just a scar.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Whew. Earth&#x2026;.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Was he too used to living in Alphen? Was there too much of a gap between how one thinks in Alphen and Earth?</span></p><p><span style="">If he went to the hospital right now to take a psychological examination, then would they want him to admit himself into the hospital?</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I&#x2019;ve changed. Everything has change&#x2026;&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Too many things had changed. He became monster of his own volition. Even if he had pined for his home land everyday for the past 20 years, it was inevitable for him to become estranged.</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin emptied another glass of soju.</span></p><p><span style="">As he was refilling his glass, he glanced towards Jiwon.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;That son of a bitch. Now I can&#x2019;t get it off my mind.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Sunggo&#x2019;s words were bothering Woojin for no reason at all. After emptying his glass, he picked up the fallen hat, then he placed it back on Jiwon&#x2019;s head.</span></p><p><span style="">Ggol, ggol.</span></p><p><span style="">He spoke aloud as he refilled his soju glass.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ah, this is my last glass.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin looked towards the inner part of the restaurant. The granny, who was the owner, had already went in to sleep. It basically meant they were suppose to leave on their own after they finished drinking.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ughh.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin emptied the last precious glass of soju. Then he patted Jiwon&#x2019;s shoulder.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Let&#x2019;s go home.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;&#x2026;.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Jeez.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin carried the completely passed out Jiwon in his arms.</span></p><p><span style="">*</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Uh-muh. Look at that woman.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Is she dead? Did that person do that to her?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ooh. Disgusting.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I think I&#x2019;m going to throw up what I ate earlier. Ooh-ook.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin was carrying Jiwon in a princess carry. Every time her hat slipped off they became the center of attention, and he was annoyed by it.</span></p><p><span style="">Why did he have to go through this after drinking alcohol in a good mood?</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin was putting back her hat again when he had a great idea. He approached a convenience store, then he placed Jiwon on a chair for a brief moment. Then he headed into the convenience store.</span></p><p><span style="">*</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Everything will probably be all right.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">As Jaemin headed back home, he let out a sigh of worry. In the past, his noonah had been praised as being a Queen card. (TLN: Queenca~basically the queen bee)</span></p><p><span style="">Everything changed after her accident.</span></p><p><span style="">She used to be very prim and proper. She had a lively personality, and her looks&#x2026; Moreover, the people around her changed.</span></p><p><span style="">She worked hard at the factory to earn a living for her only remaining family, Jaemin. Jaemin knew how his noonah felt, so he studied hard without going astray.</span></p><p><span style="">Ddi ddi dii, ddi-ro-ri.</span></p><p><span style="">When he opened the door, he saw the baby cat lying on top of his bed watching the tv.</span></p><p><span style="">Uh? Something was off?</span></p><p><span style="">Jaemin was surprised. He took off his shoes, and he looked at the tv inside his room. It was showing a children&#x2019;s animation show called Pororo.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Huh. Did you turn it on?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Nyahh.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The cat vocalized in a cute manner. Jaemin grinned as he looked at her. What kind of talent did this cat have where she was able to watch the tv? She probably stepped on the remote control by mistake.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ah. Hyung picked up the cat, but he didn&#x2019;t buy any items needed for a cat.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Jaemin changed out of his school uniform then he sat in front of his computer. He accessed a portal site, then he searched for essential items for a cat like a litter box, sand and cat food. Then he suddenly remembered this cat had been cooped up in this house for the entire day.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ha-ah. Come here.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Nyahhh.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">As if she understood human words, the cat didn&#x2019;t run away even when he stretched out his arms towards her. Jaemin looked into the cat&#x2019;s eyes.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hehe. She&#x2019;s very cute. Are you hungry, Bibi?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Jaemin momentarily placed the cat on top of the dining table, then he opened the refrigerator. He was going to give it a sausage he usually buys&#x2026;</span></p><p><span style="">Did someone eat it?</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Uh?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">He had no memories of eating it, but the sausage was gone. He looked through the trash can, and he saw the plastic covering of the sausage thrown away there.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ha. This hyung really&#x2026;&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">There was no way a cat would be able to open the refrigerator and eat the sausage. Woojin was the culprit. Since it had already turned out like this, Jaemin hurriedly went to a convenience store to buy various cat items.</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin had given him a lot of spending money, so Jaemin wasn&#x2019;t tight on money. Even if he invested his money into the cat, it wouldn&#x2019;t be burdensome.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hehe. Is it tasty?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Nyahhh.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Jaemin opened the can, and he stared at the cat. The baby cat, Bibi, sniffed at it several times. However, it seemed she had no thoughts of eating it.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Uh? Why aren&#x2019;t you eating? Try eating it.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">His anticipation-filled gaze fell on the cat, and the cat let out a light sigh&#x2026;. Uh? Do cats have such expressive faces? Anyways, she let out a light sigh then she started lick the contents of the can.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Nyahhhhhng!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">When the tip of her tongue touched the food, the cat&#x2019;s eyes widened, and she quickly ate the entire content of the can.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hehe. Eat well.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">She hadn&#x2019;t eaten all day, so she must have been very hungry . Jaemin looked at the cat with satisfaction, then he sat in front of his computer. Like always he enjoyed surfing the web for a brief moment, then he glanced at the front door.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Recently, I&#x2026;.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Jaemin usually lived by himself, but after Woojin show up, he wasn&#x2019;t able to have his own personal private time.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ah. This is the time.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Jaemin quickly calculated in his head. The adults were drinking alcohol, so at the very least, they will be gone for 2 hours. Jaemin would be alone for at least that amount of time.</span></p><p><span style="">He used his mouse pointer to find the files hidden deep within the computer.</span></p><p><span style="">*</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ah. Why is this bastard not picking up his phone?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Jaemin wasn&#x2019;t picking up his phone, so Woojin eventually opened the door while he was carrying Jiwon.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Nyahhh.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Bibi ran towards him, and she started rubbing her body against his leg. She had really wanted to see her master.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Master. It seems you have become stronger than last time-ahong..&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I leveled up a little bit. Anyways, why is he sleeping?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin pointed toward Jaemin, who was passed out on top of the bed. He had fainted with a blissful expression on his face.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Nyahng. He was watching humans copulate, and he was taking care of himself. So I let him have a good dream-ahong.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Low ranked Demon. Nightmare. Succubus Bibi.</span></p><p><span style="">It wasn&#x2019;t only nighmares. Bibi&#x2019;s specialty was causing erotic dreams.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Chet. You are going to unnecessarily give the kid a wet dream&#x2026;.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Nyahng. He is probably tasting heaven right now-ahong.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;All right. Just unfold the blanket.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Nyahng.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Bibi opened the closet, then she took out a blanket. It was hard to think of her as a cat when one saw her powerful strength.</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin placed Do-jiwon on top of the blanket then he turned around.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Whew. I&#x2019;m going out.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Nyahng.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Bibii jumped on top of Woojin&#x2019;s shoulder. Woojin thoughtabout finding a motel, but there weren&#x2019;t any nearby. He thought about going back home to his mother and Sooah, but he gave up on that idea.</span></p><p><span style="">He was worried about showing himself suffering under a nightmare. Fortunately, Woojin had a key that opens any door in the modern times. He had money.</span></p><p><span style="">He headed towards a hotel near the Hammer guild.</span></p><p><span style="">The employee told him he couldn&#x2019;t bring his pet to stay in the hotel. Woojin told the employee he&#x2019;ll put the cat somewhere else. He stepped outside for a moment, and he canceled Bibi&#x2019;s summon. Then he was able to book a hotel room.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Come out Bibi.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">After he locked the door to his room, Woojin called for Bibi. A black smoke formed, and it coalesced into the shape of a baby cat.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Nyahhng. This is a hotel-ahong?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;That&#x2019;s right. This room cost $300.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Nyahhng. Earth is a really nice place to live. Oh yea. The thing called cat food is really delicious-nyahng. The cats on earth grow up eating such delicious food. It is a happy planet-nahong. Next time give me more as a favor-nyahng.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin grinned.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;By the way, Bibi.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Nyahng?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Do you remember what Alphen was like before Trahnet invaded it?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Nyahng? Master was my first contract, so I have no idea-ahong. I lived in the Demon world before that.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Whew. I guess I&#x2019;ll have to level up fast.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">At the very least he had to reach lvl80, so he could summon the Lich.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;It&#x2019;s been a long time. Let&#x2019;s sleep comfortably.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Nyahng.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin laid down on top of the bed, and Bibi placed herself next to Woojin&#x2019;s pillow. After a brief silent moment, she heard Woojin&#x2019;s rhythmic breathing, and Bibi&#x2019;s eyes turned entirely black.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Kyahhk. You lowly demons.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The evil spirits suppressed by Woojin&#x2019;s Control started to swirl around Woojin. They took advantage of Woojin&#x2019;s consciousness becoming murky. These evil spirits existed to torment Woojin.</span></p><p><span style="">The low rank Succubus Bibi was the only one who could help Woojin. She helped prevent the evil spirits from tormenting Woojin.</span></p><p><span style="">She controlled Woojin&#x2019;s dream by making it a nightmare.</span></p><p><span style="">*</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin&#x2019;s consciousness became fuzzy.</span></p><p><span style="">It felt like he was being suck into the abyss. He was in the deep recess of his consciousness.</span></p><p><span style="">It felt like he was sinking indefinitely, and he felt his limbs tremble as a sticky liquid bound them.</span></p><p><span style="">It was red and sticky.</span></p><p><span style="">Blood. Blood. Blood. And then more blood&#x2026;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin was standing on top of a lake made out of blood. The blood darkened, and it reverberated as it made a wave. Then the wave turned into hands and they grabbed his ankles.</span></p><p><span style="">[Don&#x2019;t abandon us.]</span></p><p><span style="">The black hands swayed towards him, and the hands stretched towards Woojin. The contorted faces was despair itself.</span></p><p><span style="">[Please save us.]</span></p><p><span style="">They had been thrown away. He had thrown away these beings.</span></p><p><span style="">[Us. Our Monarch. Please take us away from the pain&#x2026;]</span></p><p><span style="">Some only had hands, and others only had their upper body. There were corpses of various size and shape. The corpses clung onto Woojin&#x2019;s body.</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin couldn&#x2019;t shake them off. He couldn&#x2019;t even take one step.</span></p><p><span style="">He silently endured everything.</span></p><p><span style="">[Oh Monarch of Alandal&#x2026;.]</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin&#x2019;s two eyes, which had been lively, started to shed tears. It was filled with regret and lingering attachment.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I&#x2019;m sorry&#x2026;.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Were these the beings he killed? No.</span></p><p><span style="">These were those who he hadn&#x2019;t been able to protect. The souls of the people he couldn&#x2019;t protect had turned into evil spirits, and they were circling around him. These souls had no where to go, and they couldn&#x2019;t let go of their vengeful spirit.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;I&#x2019;m sorry I couldn&#x2019;t protect&#x2026; I&#x2019;m sorry.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">This was how Woojin was able to persevere through everything.</span></p><p><span style="">Before Woojin could be swallowed up by the swamp of evil spirits at the field of corpses, a booming sound was heard from the distance.</span></p><p><span style="">A large penguin, a dinosaur walking on two legs, a beaver, a bear, and even a fox showed up.</span></p><p><span style="">Large friends of Pororo mounted an attack.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Am I going to be chased by them ii today&#x2019;s nightmare?&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">Before he knew it, the evil spirits had disappeared. If he was stepped on by one of Pororo&#x2019;s friends, he would probably be crushed to death. As he was chased by them, Woojin smiled.</span></p><p></p></div><p></p>
