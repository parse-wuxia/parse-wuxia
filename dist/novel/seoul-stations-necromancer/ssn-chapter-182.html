<p><span style="">Chapter 182 &#x2013; Bone Dragon (2)</span></p><p><span style="">Fear.</span></p><p><span style="">The beings, who were always the predators, felt an emotion only felt by their preys.</span></p><p><span style="">Goo-oh-oh-oh!</span></p><p><span style="">Their domineering roars sounded like wails now.</span></p><p><span style="">Several thousand Minotaurs in the Minotaur army was in panic, and they were running around in confusion.</span></p><p><span style="">In front of the overwhelming marvel from space, they were merely a speck of dust.</span></p><p><span style="">A very small speck....</span></p><p><span style="">Ggoo-oohng.</span></p><p><span style="">It was only a single meteor, but when it impacted on the surface, an incredible amount of energy and shockwave was released. &#xA0;It turned everything into dust.</span></p><p><span style="">Koo-ah-ah-ah-ahng!</span></p><p><span style="">The emitted shockwave swallowed even the farthest monsters running away.</span></p><p><span style="">Koo-ooh-ooh-ooh.</span></p><p><span style="">There was a massive crater, and one couldn&apos;t even see traces of corpses in the aftermath. &#xA0;It only left behind the traces of this incredibly destructive magic.</span></p><p><span style="">The mastermind behind the attack could feel the aftereffects of the shockwave even from within his barrier.</span></p><p><span style="">Poo-she-she-sheek.</span></p><p><span style="">Before the dust could settle, Jaenis&apos; barrier started to fade away.</span></p><p><span style="">Ggoo-ahng!</span></p><p><span style="">Unon&apos;s kick was concentrated at a single point on the barrier, and it broke in an instant.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Why are you in such a hurry?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Unon frowned at Woojin&apos;s words.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;It seems I wasted my precious Points.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Was it completely pointless to bring a great army to hunt down the Immortal? &#xA0;Maybe, it would have been better to form an elite unit like Celrak to clear the Immortal&apos;s Dungeon repeatedly.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Your Points...&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">His loss didn&apos;t just end at losing his precious Points when his monster army was wiped out. &#xA0;It also gave a new source of life energy to Woojin.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Can&apos;t you feel it?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">He spread both his arms.</span></p><p><span style="">The air was hot from the heat, and it was full of dust.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;....&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Unon glared at Woojin.</span></p><p><span style="">He was dumbfounded at the fact that his army was wiped away in a single move, but the Immortal was in the same boat as him.</span></p><p><span style="">Now he just had to delay the Immortal for a short amount of time.</span></p><p><span style="">The Dragons, Fatooh and Leia, should be at the Immortal&apos;s Colony soon.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;It seems you also lost all your subordinates.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Really? &#xA0;I&apos;m certain that hadn&apos;t occurred.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Was the Immortal trying to trigger him into feeling nervous?</span></p><p><span style="">It was nonsensical tactic.</span></p><p><span style="">Choo-choo-choo-choot.</span></p><p><span style="">The dust was moving in a strange way.</span></p><p><span style="">The bone dusts from the tens of thousand monsters were coalescing.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;....&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Unon frowned.</span></p><p><span style="">He could tell the Immortal&apos;s emotions hadn&#x2019;t changed much, so his response sounded out of place.</span></p><p><span style="">The Harpy Queen Shirao, who bas besides him, glared at Woojin.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I&apos;m pretty sure you&apos;ll have your hands full fighting us.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">The Immortal&apos;s Undead army was in excellent health. &#xA0;He could just re-summon them again.</span></p><p><span style="">However, Unon and Shirao thought they would be able to delay him for a certain amount of time.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I&apos;m not your opponent.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;.....&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Before she could answer Woojin&apos;s words, the bone dusts started to form a figure.</span></p><p><span style="">A long spinal column formed from head to tail, and the ribs started to form. &#xA0;Just by looking at its skeletal structure, one could tell that this creature had been massive in life.</span></p><p><span style="">Its wings were only made out of bones, and it was refined to sharpness. &#xA0;The wing in itself would be a fantastic weapon. &#xA0;Then there were two pits in its enormous head. &#xA0;&#xA0;Red lights flickered to life as it flared into large flames within the pits, and they started emitting light. </span></p><p><span style="">[Koo-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh!]</span></p><p><span style="">It was the Undead army&apos;s biggest problem child. &#xA0;Yong Yong let out a long roar.</span></p><p><span style="">[Koo-roo-roo.]</span></p><p><span style="">The long neck swung, and its large head faced towards Woojin.</span></p><p><span style="">[You have summoned me. &#xA0;What is your wish?]</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin smirked at the familiar voice. &#xA0;If Bibi was here, she would have made a big fuss as she rubbed her cheeks against Yong Yong.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Kill them, then follow me.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">[Koo-roo-roo.]</span></p><p><span style="">Yong Yong turned his head, and his gaze reached Shirao and Unon.</span></p><p><span style="">[I&apos;ve received your wish.]</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I&apos;ll see you a little bit later.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin summoned Shing Shing, and he got on.</span></p><p><span style="">Heeeng.</span></p><p><span style="">Shing Shing galloped into the sky, and Jaenis flew beside them using Flight magic.</span></p><p><span style="">[That bag of bones. &#xA0;It seems he still has dementia. &#xA0;Goo-ha-ha.]</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;It&apos;s all good.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin smirked. &#xA0;Yong Yong was the first Dragon. &#xA0;He had lived so long that he hadn&#x2019;t been able to escape the curse of forgetfulness.</span></p><p><span style="">It had been awhile, since he had seen Yong Yong. &#xA0;He was just glad to see him again.</span></p><p><span style="">When the Phantom Steed and the Lich quickly escaped the battlefield, Shirao quickly tried to follow them through the air.</span></p><p><span style="">Kwah-jeek!</span></p><p><span style="">[Where are you going, my cute little bird?]</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Eeek. &#xA0;Let me go!&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Shirao struggled, but she was in Yong Yong&apos;s grasp. &#xA0;He moved her towards his mouth.</span></p><p><span style="">Shwahhhk, kwahng, kwahng!</span></p><p><span style="">Unon desperately kicked him, but the Undead Dragon&apos;s bones were too sturdy.</span></p><p><span style="">Kwah-jeek.</span></p><p><span style="">Yong Yong took a bite out of the Harpy Queen as if he was eating a biscuit, and he moved to squash the being that was kicking him.</span></p><p><span style="">Kwahng!</span></p><p><span style="">However, Unon had trained his body to the extreme, so his movements was extraordinary. &#xA0;There was no way he would be easily caught by Yong Yong&apos;s claws.</span></p><p><span style="">[Koo-roohk...]</span></p><p><span style="">The angry Yong Yong let out a sigh, and he started to curl up. &#xA0;The dry bones of his wings quickly covered him, and the Dragon curled up as if it was going to sleep. &#xA0;Unon looked at the Dragon with disbelief on his face.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;...what kind of...&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">From one to ten, he hated everything about the Immortal. &#xA0;He hated all of Immortal&apos;s Familiars.</span></p><p><span style="">Yong Yong wasn&apos;t showing any will to fight, so he turned to looked at Woojin and the Lich, who was flying far into the distance.</span></p><p><span style="">Kwah-jeek!</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;...&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">It had been a brief moment, but Unon had took his eyes off of Yong Yong. &#xA0;A long bone that looked like a hook was protruding from Unon&apos;s stomach.</span></p><p><span style="">[Koo-roo-roo.]</span></p><p><span style="">Yong Yong took a bite out of Unon, who was stuck on his claw. &#xA0;His sharp canines separate Unon&apos;s body from its head.</span></p><p><span style="">Yong Yong licked his chops when Unon disappeared into a gray light. &#xA0;He once again looked at Woojin flying into the distance.</span></p><p><span style="">[Your wish has been fulfilled.]</span></p><p><span style="">Koo-oohng. Koong.</span></p><p><span style="">Soon, it started running after Woojin. It looked clumsy running on all four feet, but it was so large that the sight was scary rather than it being funny.</span></p><p><span style="">[Too bad. Koo-roo-roo.]</span></p><p><span style="">Yong Yong flapped his bony appendages.</span></p><p><span style="">His wings had lost the ability of flight, so it looked pitiful.</span></p><p><span style="">***</span></p><p><span style="">Fatooh and Leia.</span></p><p><span style="">They were similar to the Gold Dragon Rajakui, who appeared on earth. &#xA0;They were Dimensional lords from the Dragon race.</span></p><p><span style="">Amongst the Dragons, Fatooh and Leia were the only great lords, who possessed Codes. &#xA0;They enjoyed ruling over other beings, and they would rather accept a bribe rather than pillage. &#xA0;These two beings had come out of their Dungeons, and they were aiming for Woojin&apos;s Colony....</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Is Thrash really worth this much fear?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Trahnet&apos;s great lords were pooling their strength for this all out attack.</span></p><p><span style="">Jaenis and Woojin could see the pointy peak of the Saurus mountain, and they could also see too large creatures approaching the mountain from the sky.</span></p><p><span style="">They were so big that Woojin could see them from afar.</span></p><p><span style="">[Is it more useless Dragons again?]</span></p><p><span style="">Jaenis looked a bit wistful. &#xA0;A Dimensional lord&apos;s body was never left behind after death, so Jaenis wouldn&apos;t gain much from killing them.</span></p><p><span style="">He wasn&apos;t a Dragon Slayer, but Dragons left behind pretty useful ingredients.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Who cares if it is a dragon or a person?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">They were great lords of Trahnet.</span></p><p><span style="">The fact that they had to die wouldn&#x2019;t change.</span></p><p><span style="">[This isn&apos;t good.]</span></p><p><span style="">Jaenis felt the resonance of magical energy, and it alerted him to the danger. &#xA0;The Dragons were arched like a bow, and their stomachs were bloated. &#xA0;It seemed they were about to let out the Dragon Breaths from mid-air.</span></p><p><span style="">They were already too late.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;...you should Blink us above them.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">It was a short distance teleportation spell.</span></p><p><span style="">One could move anywhere where one could see, and the range was dependent on one&apos;s control over magical energy.</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin had the best magician by his side, but Jaenis was also the worst magician for this situation.</span></p><p><span style="">[That is a good idea.]</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin was riding on top of Shing Shing, and Jaenis placed his hand on Woojin&apos;s shoulder.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Hurry!&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">[I&apos;m not in range yet.]</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;....&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin&apos;s face was filled with anxiousness.</span></p><p><span style="">The engorged stomach of the Dragons looked very large.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Are we there yet?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">[A little bit more...]</span></p><p><span style="">The Dragon that had been lagging behind the other one brought down its head as red flame erupted from its wide open jaw.</span></p><p><span style="">It headed towards the Colony&apos;s Symbol. &#xA0;The Dragon&apos;s Breath shot towards the World Tree like a laser, and Woojin felt his heart lurch.</span></p><p><span style="">It he lost the gate, he couldn&apos;t return to earth. &#xA0;He would be able to gain another Dungeon, but he had to wait for the Synchronization...</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Hurry!&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Accompanying his shout, Jaenis and Woojin disappeared at the same time. &#xA0;However, they appeared above the Dragon&apos;s head.</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin was in freefall as he brought out his Warrior&apos;s Weapon. &#xA0;After changing its form to an axe, he brought it down on the Red Dragon Leia&apos;s head.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Block it!&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin let out an order, which was filled with desperation.</span></p><p><span style="">He hoped Jaenis&apos; barrier would be able to protect the World Tree....</span></p><p><span style="">[Too late...]</span></p><p><span style="">He had Blinked across a large distance, so his magical consumption had been quite significant. &#xA0;In a flash, Jaenis had run out of magical energy.</span></p><p><span style="">He quickly tried to gather more, but Jaenis doubted he would be able to block the Dragon&apos;s attack.</span></p><p><span style="">On the other hand, Leia had been defenseless, since it was about to let out its Breath. &#xA0;Woojin had brought down his axe in anger, and Leia&apos;s head was split open.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Koo-ah-ah!&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Leia let out a roar as she plummeted to the ground with Woojin and his axe.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;....&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin&apos;s gaze headed towards the World Tree. &#xA0;If his Colony took a direct hit from the Breath, it would burn....</span></p><p><span style="">It didn&apos;t.</span></p><p><span style="">[It is a miracle.]</span></p><p><span style="">The Coalition had blocked it.</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin let out a sigh of relief, and he pulled out the axe embedded inside Leia&apos;s head.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Drop Fatooh.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">[That won&apos;t be difficult.]</span></p><p><span style="">Jaenis started to pour out the magical energy he had gathered towards the Gold Dragon Fatooh.</span></p><p><span style="">***</span></p><p><span style="">Ggoo-ooh-oong.</span></p><p><span style="">The meteor fell a long distance away, but the aftershock was felt at the Saurus mountain. &#xA0;It even made the monsters, who had be tirelessly attacking the Colony, to pause.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;That&apos;s Jaenis! &#xA0;My teacher is here.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">His teacher was the only one, who could used Delay, on a meteor summon spell of that caliber. Sunggoo let out a shout filled with joy. &#xA0;Graham&apos;s eyes became round when he saw Sunggoo&apos;s behavior.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Didn&apos;t you say your teacher was dead?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;He is dead, but he is still very energetic.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Was there a difference in definition between the word from earth and Alphen? &#xA0;Graham had a frown on his face as Jaemin laughed from the side.</span></p><p><span style="">The tension and the oppressive feeling that had been suffocating them vanished just from the appearance of Woojin. &#xA0;It felt as if the sense of responsibility they felt was lifted.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Jaenis is a Lich.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Lich?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">A single eyebrow twitched on Graham&apos;s face.</span></p><p><span style="">If he was referring to a Lich, it was understandable to refer one&apos;s magical teacher as dead...</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Li...Li...Li...Lich?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Graham became startled.</span></p><p><span style="">There was only one Lich, who traveled with the Immortal.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Y...your teacher is the Sovereign of Pestilence?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">He was the worst, the strongest and the best magician.</span></p><p><span style="">His existence itself was a calamity.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;My god....&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Sunggoo let out a broad smile at the shocked Graham.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Heh heh. &#xA0;It seems teacher is quite famous over here.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">He was famous, but he was known for being bad.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;When he comes here, I&apos;ll introduce you to him.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;.....&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Should he run away? </span></p><p><span style="">While Graham mulled over useless worries, Jaemin pointed towards that sky.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Is that hyung-nim?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Mmmm. &#xA0;It is.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Sunggoo nodded his head when he saw Woojin streaking through the sky.</span></p><p><span style="">The Lich was trailing behind Woojin using Flight Magic. &#xA0;Sunggoo had seen Jaenis in flight, so he was able to identify Jaenis.</span></p><p><span style="">One was Shing Shing, and the other one was the Lich in flight.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;We just have to hold out a little bit more.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Kahng-woojin was back. Since the Colony was intact, it would be trivial for him to recover the destroyed castle.</span></p><p><span style="">Moreover, he would be able to replenish their troops. &#xA0;The monsters running across the outer wall wouldn&apos;t be a problem.</span></p><p><span style="">This also held true for the two Dragons in the sky.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Uh?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Uh uh?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">They had unintentionally looked up towards the sky, and they became surprised.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;It&apos;s a Dragon&#x2019;s Breath!&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">The first one to come to his senses was the Archmage Graham. &#xA0;He reflexively put up a barrier, but it was broken too easily by the Dragon&apos;s Breath.</span></p><p><span style="">Leia&apos;s Dragon Breath was heading towards the World Tree.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;....&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Sunggoo ran forward.</span></p><p><span style="">If they lost this location, they would lose the ability to get back to earth.</span></p><p><span style="">&apos;Will I be able to do it?&apos;</span></p><p><span style="">He wasn&apos;t confident he could do this. &#xA0;No, he was a little bit confident that he&apos;ll be able to pull this off.</span></p><p><span style="">&apos;It will work out somehow.&apos;</span></p><p><span style="">Hwah-roo-roohk.</span></p><p><span style="">His running body was engulfed in flame, and Sunggoo quickly stood in front of the World Tree. &#xA0;When the Breath arrived right in front of him, the burning Sunggoo opened both his arms wide.</span></p>
