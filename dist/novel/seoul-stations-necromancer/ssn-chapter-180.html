<p>Chapter 180 - Defense (4)</p><p><span style="">Koo-roo-roohk.</span></p><p><span style="">The imposing sounds of the monsters advancing was heard between the spires.</span></p><p><span style="">There were rhinoceros-like monsters on the march. &#xA0;There were also several thousand Minotaur warriors amongst the army. One could see occasional rhino monsters that were larger than elephants.</span></p><p><span style="">As expected of something so large, a massive amount of luggage was hanging off their enormous body.</span></p><p><span style="">On an exceptionally large rhino, a platform made out of wood was strapped onto the back of the monster. &#xA0;An unusually handsome man, who looked out of place in this monster army, was lying on top of this platform.</span></p><p><span style="">Koo-ooh-oong, koo-ooh-oong.</span></p><p><span style="">Every time the rhinoceros monster took a step, the wooden platform rolled as if it was on a large wave. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">The man vacantly looked up into the sky as he lay there. There was no guardrails to the platform, yet no one was worried about him falling off.</span></p><p><span style="">He wore his long black hair loose, and he had thin lips. &#xA0;He was the 36th Throne Unon.</span></p><p><span style="">He was using his two hands as a pillow, and he had his legs intertwined. &#xA0;If it wasn&apos;t for the sight around him, he looked like a farmer taking a break during a picnic.</span></p><p><span style="">Shwahhk.</span></p><p><span style="">The small dot in the blue sky was getting larger, and something was approaching him.</span></p><p><span style="">It was Harpy Queen Shirao. &#xA0;She had black wings, and a sharp face.</span></p><p><span style="">When she dropped out from the sky, she gripped the edge of the platform with her bird&apos;s feet. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Shirao?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;This isn&apos;t the time to be lounging around, Unon.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Unon discreetly opened his eyes to look at Shirao, then he closed his eyes again. &#xA0;As if she was frustrated, the Harpy Queen puffed out her cheek.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Those bastards cut off the road again, Unon.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;You don&apos;t have to be in such a hurry. &#xA0;They&apos;ll all die eventually.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;The Immortal is getting closer by the minute!&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Unon unfurled the arms he was using as a pillow, and he sat up. The platform was made from ash trees. &#xA0;It was his longtime hobby to smell the fragrance of the wood as he lie on top of it.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;We&apos;ll have to fight that bastard eventually.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;What if he goes back to earth?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I don&apos;t think he&apos;ll be able to. &#xA0;He still doesn&apos;t have the key.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Hmm. &#xA0;How can you be so sure?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;If he had it, it wouldn&apos;t take him this long to get here.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">The effect of the Thrash&apos;s set items were huge. &#xA0;It was able to amplify the power of Undead army by several magnitudes.</span></p><p><span style="">When the Immortal had Thrash&#x2019;s set, the Dimensional lords had no choice, but to give up a huge part of Alphen to the Immortal&apos;s army. &#xA0;This was how powerful the effects of the items were.</span></p><p><span style="">Even if the Dimensional lords were focusing their attacks on him, the Immortal would have halted their progress already if he had those Items. &#xA0;It was evidence that the Immortal haven&apos;t acquired all his qualifications yet.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Aren&apos;t you worried, Unon?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Of course, I&apos;m worried.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I would have never guess that he was a human from earth.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Unon smirked at Shirao&apos;s words.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;True.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">If he had known the Immortal was from earth, he would have eliminated the Immortal immediately. &#xA0;Many Necromancers pined for Thrash&apos;s set, and Unon had thought the Immortal was one of those Necromancers.</span></p><p><span style="">If he originated from Alphen, there was no way he could obtain the most important piece of the set. &#xA0;He wouldn&apos;t be able to acquire the Executioner.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;You lived for a very long time, so you probably know about it. &#xA0;Weren&apos;t you there when Thrash was sealed?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;No. &#xA0;I wasn&apos;t alive back then.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I guess it happened in the far distant past.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Harpy Queen Shirao had already folded her wings, and she modestly sat on one side of the platform.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;You aren&#x2019;t going?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;My heart has calmed down after talking with you, Unon. &#xA0;Anyways, we just have to prevent the Immortal from getting back to earth.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Yes.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">If the Immortal died, he would be revived.</span></p><p><span style="">He was now a Dimensional lord.</span></p><p><span style="">The immortality was a rule and a promise that had to be kept for anyone that earned the Dimensional Fragments.</span></p><p><span style="">It felt as if the Immortal had slyly entrenched himself by exploiting a crack in the system, and he was trying to pull a fast one on them.</span></p><p><span style="">If they couldn&apos;t eliminate him, they had to deny him the opportunity of reaching his goal. &#xA0;Alphen would become that bastard&apos;s jail.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;So when are you going to earth, Unon?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Earth has only one code. &#xA0;I&apos;m not interested.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;So you want to keep staying on Alphen?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;It isn&apos;t too bad here.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Alphen still had four Codes left. &#xA0;Only one Dimensional lord was able to earn the Code for this place.</span></p><p><span style="">Only a single great lord of the 72 Thrones were able to get his hands on a Master Code of Alphen.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Hmm. &#xA0;Should I stay here with you?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;You don&apos;t have to.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Hmmph. &#xA0;Even you are giving up on earth, so how will I be able to compete over there? &#xA0;Moreover, that places hasn&apos;t gone through a proper synchronization yet.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">The planet hadn&apos;t gone through synchronization yet. &#xA0;Even if they did find the Code, it would be useless since the earth hadn&apos;t flowered yet.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Well, you can stay if you want to.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Hmmph.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Shirao let out a sullen sound at Unon&apos;s apathetic words.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Let me ask you this, Unon. &#xA0;Do you think he&apos;ll really be able to acquire Thrash&apos;s Executioner?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;It is impossible.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;...?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Her eyes turned round.</span></p><p><span style="">So why did they have to work so hard to kill him? &#xA0;They even had to waste a lot of Points.</span></p><p><span style="">Shirao saw Unon&apos;s most serious expression, since she started this conversation.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Still, it is dangerous. &#xA0;We have to keep Thrash asleep.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Unon....&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;We can never let the god of Destruction to appear once again.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;....&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">She could feel the fear hidden beneath the surface, and she unconsciously shuddered.</span></p><p><span style="">The great lord Unon, who had 36 Master Codes, was speaking this way.</span></p><p><span style="">It was like the story of old. &#xA0;She felt the terror of the god of Destruction indirectly through him.</span></p><p><span style="">***</span></p><p><span style="">Kwahhh!</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Block them! &#xA0;Aim for their eyes!&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">The Saurus Colony was on fire.</span></p><p><span style="">The soldiers were were fighting a desperate battle, but the enemies were being pushed towards them like a wave. &#xA0;Siege equipments weren&apos;t even necessary.</span></p><p><span style="">The corpses piled up like a mountain, and it acted like a ladder. &#xA0;None of the defenders could stop the enemies from coming over the wall.</span></p><p><span style="">Before a proper siege could even take place, several hundred defenders were already killed.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;This won&apos;t work.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;The outer walls are at its limit. &#xA0;We have to retreat to the inner walls.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Their enemies were using their overwhelming numbers to send continuous waves of attack.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;If we retreat to the inner castle walls, we&apos;ll be completely cut-off. &#xA0;It isn&apos;t too late. &#xA0;Let us charge through their lines. &#xA0;We have to get away.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">The opinions on what to do was split, so Tauric searched for Do-jaemin. &#xA0;He was the only one, who was able to contact Kahng-woojin.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;He is almost here. &#xA0;Please wait a little bit more...&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;...he has already exceeded his promise by two days.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;That&apos;s right. &#xA0;We can no longer trust his words.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Graham and several other heroes revealed their foul mood. &#xA0;They had trusted Kahng-woojin&apos;s word without a hint of doubt, and they had been waiting as they prepared for the defense.</span></p><p><span style="">However, two days had passed since the promised time. &#xA0;The enemies were much stronger than they had expected, and a lot of people had already died. &#xA0;This was their lives on the line, so they were showing resentment now. &#xA0;It was inevitable.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;...but he really is almost here.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Do-jaemin didn&apos;t have anything else he could say. &#xA0;Woojin had promised that he&apos;ll be back in a week, but two days had already past.</span></p><p><span style="">Fortunately, Sunggoo&apos;s remarkable activities were able to delay the army&apos;s progress by over a day. </span></p><p><span style="">The enemies had started their attack only five hours ago.</span></p><p><span style="">In just five hours time, the outer castle walls were practically in ruins. &#xA0;Moreover, the Dimensional lords still hadn&apos;t attacked in earnest.</span></p><p><span style="">Basically, there was no guarantee that they&apos;ll be able to last for a day.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Oh, Skia&apos;s Monk! &#xA0;If we don&apos;t run away now, we&apos;ll all die.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Tauric put on a pained expression at Archmage Graham&apos;s words. &#xA0;He would be committing several hundred to several thousand lives to this decision. &#xA0;Of course, he felt afraid and tormented.</span></p><p><span style="">Hwah-roo-roohk.</span></p><p><span style="">At that moment, a flame erupted from the middle of the mountain where the research facility was located at.</span></p><p><span style="">Kwahhhhng.</span></p><p><span style="">The burst of flame rose into the air like fireworks, and it exploded. &#xA0;Rain of sharp fire started to drop to the ground.</span></p><p><span style="">Poo-shoo-shoo-shoohk!</span></p><p><span style="">It was as if several thousand archers were shooting fire arrows. &#xA0;When the magic fell into the enemies, the effect was incredible.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;....&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Tauric gritted his teeth as he watched the sight in front of him.</span></p><p><span style="">Hong-sunggoo.</span></p><p><span style="">If it wasn&apos;t for the Fire Spirit King from earth, they wouldn&apos;t have been able to resist against the enemy&apos;s advance. &#xA0;They wouldn&apos;t even have a fighting chance.</span></p><p><span style="">They probably would have pushed the fight into the future, and they would have run away...</span></p><p><span style="">Tauric&apos;s lips opened.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Even if we do manage to get away, we won&apos;t have any future. &#xA0;If we break right now, we&apos;ll just be walking down the road towards destruction.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Some will run, and some will stay to fight... &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">However, he no longer had full control over his men.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Let us abandon the outer walls, and we should retreat towards the inner walls. &#xA0;Let us focus on defense.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Several people complained about Tauric&apos;s words, but they didn&#x2019;t argue against him.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Graham. &#xA0;I want you to put up a barrier, so our forces can retreat.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Understood.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">The Archmage Graham&apos;s magic was a necessity. &#xA0;If not for him, they would have fallen in the initial moments of the battle as the dragonfly-like monsters had attacked from the sky.</span></p><p><span style="">Tauric turned to look at Jaemin.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Count. &#xA0;you should inform all the heroes about the retreat.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Yes.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Jaemin waved his hand once. &#xA0;A flock of bats exited from his ripped sleeves, and they flew in all directions to deliver the news.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Let us make our last stand at the research facility and the barrier around the Colony.</span></p><p><span style="">There was the barrier erected by the World Tree, and the research facility had the magic amplifier, which Sunggoo was using. &#xA0;They&apos;ll be able to hold out for a little longer.</span></p><p><span style="">Since this was a fight they couldn&apos;t win, the only important thing right now was for Kahng-woojin to return before their losses got too big.</span></p><p><span style="">&apos;Please hurry up.&apos;</span></p><p><span style="">Jaemin sent his desperate desire towards Woojin.</span></p><p><span style="">***</span></p><p><span style="">Kwah-kwah-kwahng!</span></p><p><span style="">The Soul Spears, which had extended out from Woojin&apos;s body, was flying all over the place as they pierced through the bodies of the enemies.</span></p><p><span style="">It took only a flash for the enemies to become corpses, and the corpses exploded in a chain reaction.</span></p><p><span style="">It was an endless chain of Corpse Explosion.</span></p><p><span style="">Koo-kwah-kwah-kwahng!</span></p><p><span style="">The advance of the Immortal was followed by blood, pieces of bodies, screams, and the crazed laughter of the Undead army.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Oh my goddess...&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Melody trailed behind him, and she witnessed live the Immortal that had been a fixed concept in the minds of the Coalition.</span></p><p><span style="">He was cruel, domineering, and inexorably strong.</span></p><p><span style="">His army expressed their instinctual and unfettered anger towards the living beings. &#xA0;It even made her feel sympathy towards the monsters being slaughtered.</span></p><p><span style="">As she continued to follow behind him, she felt a sense of distance and dissonance with the Kahng-woojin she had recently come to know. &#xA0;She wasn&apos;t confident as to whether she would be able to speak naturally with him.</span></p><p><span style="">The advance, which had been filled with poison, corpses and the cries of the souls, came to a stop. &#xA0;They were only a day ride from the Colony.</span></p><p><span style="">There were monsters lined up in front of them, and there was a red-haired man standing in the front.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Koo-koo-koohk. &#xA0;Who is this? &#xA0;Im. mort. al! &#xA0;The king of the dead!&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">He made invidious remarks as she slowly walked towards Woojin.</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin was thankful, since this being came to him on his own. &#xA0;Woojin wouldn&apos;t be satisfied even if this being was killed over and over again.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Celrak.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Trahnet&apos;s 27th Throne.</span></p><p><span style="">This bastard has been successful in clearing his Dungeon two days ago. &#xA0;Kiba wasn&apos;t able to stop him from clearing Raht&apos;s Temple.</span></p><p><span style="">Celrak let out a mocking smile as he looked at Woojin&apos;s angry face.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Why are you so angry? Isn&apos;t it your fault for leaving behind your Domain?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;...&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">He had a better understanding now.</span></p><p><span style="">He never understood why the Dimensional lords rarely exited their Dungeons. &#xA0;He understood why the exploration and hunt of the surrounding was done by the Domain residents and the forces of the Domain.</span></p><p><span style="">This was especially true on a planet where one didn&apos;t have the Code. &#xA0;One couldn&apos;t use the Return Portal, so one had to stay near one&apos;s Dimensional Domain to protect one&apos;s Dungeons and Colonies.</span></p><p><span style="">Or one could put several trusted defenders to defend the location.</span></p><p><span style="">Since Kiba had fallen, it seemed he had consumed all of Alandal&apos;s Points in its defense.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I don&apos;t get you. &#xA0;Why do you search for the whereabouts of the forgotten god of Destruction? Don&apos;t you have the means to become a god? &#xA0;It is eternal life.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">At Celrak&apos;s words, Woojin changed the Warrior&apos;s Weapon into its axe form. &#xA0;He wanted to split open Celrak&apos;s head.</span></p><p><span style="">Celrak grinned at Woojin&apos;s murderous intent.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;It seems you really want to protect your home planet.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Isn&apos;t that obvious?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;There are many ways to protect it. &#xA0;You could become the god of your home planet.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;What?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;On the day when my home planet was synchronized, the first thing I did was to kill my god. &#xA0;Then I became the god of my home planet. &#xA0;Koo-koohk.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;....&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;You should forget about the god of destruction. &#xA0;Just become a god. &#xA0;This is the fastest way to protect one&apos;s home planet. &#xA0;Those on my home planet are living very rich lives. &#xA0;Sacrifice is only momentary, but peace is eternal.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;...&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;My words won&apos;t fill your ears right now, but you should take my advice to heart. &#xA0;There will come a time when you&apos;ll thank me someday.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin let go of the rigidity he had expressed in his initial greeting. &#xA0;He let out a broad smile.</span></p>
