<p>Chapter 200 - Trahnet (5)</p><p><span style="">Dr. Toppler was nervous, so his shoulders tensed.</span></p><p><span style="">The immense pressure made it difficult for him to breathe properly.</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin glared as he stood in front of Dr. Toppler.</span></p><p><span style="">If Woojin swung his fist, it would be able to reach Toppler.</span></p><p><span style="">Kim-kahngchul was conflicted. &#xA0;He didn&#x2019;t know if he should stop this or not, but he didn&#x2019;t dare to step forward in such an atmosphere.</span></p><p><span style="">Everything within the isolation room&#x2026;. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">The objects&#x2026;. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">The air&#x2026;.</span></p><p><span style="">It felt as if it were all being squeezed in front of Kahng-woojin&#x2019;s power.</span></p><p><span style="">He opened his mouth.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I&apos;ll give you exactly 5 minutes. &#xA0;If you can&#x2019;t persuade me, you are dead.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">This was an unexpected opportunity. &#xA0;Toppler&#x2019;s eyes twinkled as he immediately spoke. </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;This world is a lie.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I really want to cancel the words I spoke earlier.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin spoke with a serious expression on his face. &#xA0;He didn&#x2019;t care that he had given Toppler permission to speak for 5 minutes. &#xA0;Woojin wanted to hit Toppler for using sophistry.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;may I continue?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;You&#x2019;ve used up 20 seconds.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">At Woojin&#x2019;s words, Toppler quickly took up his words again. &#xA0;The future of earth and the Moon World depended on his words.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;It was year 2529. &#xA0;War and the depletion of natural resources made it difficult for humanity to survive&#x2026;.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Dr. Toppler spoke in a serious manner, yet Woojin&#x2019;s expression was being contorted further as time passed. &#xA0;Kim-kahngchul looked on with nervous eyes.</span></p><p><span style="">Kim-kahngchul felt as if he was being forced to attend a boring lecture. &#xA0;The unfortunate part was that his life was about to end after 5 minutes, so he was anxious.</span></p><p><span style="">Toppler talked about the downfall of earth, and the selfishness of the population. &#xA0;He started getting a bit heated regarding &#xA0;the subject, so Kim-kahngchul had to pull him back.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Excuse me, professor. &#xA0;Please speak more concisely&#x2026;..&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Huh?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Kim-kahngchul&#x2019;s words broke him out of his previous state of mind.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;You have 3 minutes left.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Huhk.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">After swallowing a groan, Toppler started organizing the words he had been rambling on about. &#xA0;He spoke quickly and concisely.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Earth was completely ruined. &#xA0;&#xA0;We needed a new place to live.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Woojin thought about the sense of danger he felt inside the temples of Alphen.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Is that supposed to be Alphen?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;You are correct. &#xA0;Unfortunately, we developed a way to travel there, but the preparations that needed to be done to make the new place liveable wasn&#x2019;t finished yet. &#xA0;The terraforming is still on-going. &#xA0;Humanity had no choice, but to wait. &#xA0;This was why a way station was created. &#xA0;We created a virtual reality world.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Speak in easier terms.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;While Alphen became earth-like, we had to wait in the virtual reality world. &#xA0;Basically, we were placed in temporary housing until our house was built.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;So we are in it right now?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Correct.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;So what?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Wasn&#x2019;t it normal to ask questions about his story? &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">At the unexpected reply, Toppler became dumbfounded, and he could only reply with a question of his own.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;So what are you proposing? &#xA0;You are going to take us out from this world? &#xA0;You want us to go to the new house, since it is completed?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;I wish it was so. &#xA0;However, there was a problem.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Of course. &#xA0;A problem always arises to make everything into shit.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Some greedy people amongst us arose, and they made more virtual reality worlds. &#xA0;The total number was...&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;There were 72 of them.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;correct. &#xA0;These were virtual reality worlds, yet these individual were able to god-like power within them. &#xA0;Some even strived to become real gods. &#xA0;The source of this power and authority was rooted in the Code each possessed, and they became jealous of each other. &#xA0;Then the numerous Dimensional wars&#x2026;.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;In the end, it was an all out brawl.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;yes.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Wouldn&#x2019;t all of this be solved if everyone was awoken from the virtual reality? &#xA0;Why are you guys hesitating?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;A problem occurred regarding this issue too.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What happened?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;The terraforming on our new home hadn&#x2019;t been finished yet.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&quot;&#x2026;&#x2026;.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin looked at Toppler in dismay.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;However, we found an answer.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What is it?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Trahnet. &#xA0;It is a network that allows movement between the planets. &#xA0;We can finish the terraforming using this&#x2026;..&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Explain it in a way I can understand it.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Basically, we can dematerialize a person or object from earth. &#xA0;Then it could be beamed and rematerialized on Alphen.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;&#x2026;&#x2026;.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;So you can log in from earth, and logout from Alphen.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Are you talking about a portal?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;We used that concept as a basis to come up with this idea. &#xA0;We used it to make this solution. &#xA0;However, this isn&#x2019;t a Dimensional Shift. &#xA0;The movement between Dimensions is a method only used within the virtual reality.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin glanced at the clock on the wall.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Your five minutes is up.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;&#x2026;are you going to kill me?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;You know me well.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;You can&#x2019;t.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Why not? You should try running away like before.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Whether I run away or not, my plight is not the problem. &#xA0;We have to save the virtual reality earth, and the real earth. &#xA0;The people, who lost their Code, can only exist within the virtual reality.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Then let them live there.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Did they really need to make a distinction between reality and virtual reality?</span></p><p><span style="">From Woojin&#x2019;s experience, this was a useless distinction. &#xA0;The world was for the living, and the afterlife was for the dead.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Your earth and my earth is in peril.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Toppler had said this last time.</span></p><p><span style="">Dr. Toppler had said they were heading towards the same goal, and his words once again circled around Woojin&#x2019;s ears. &#xA0;It was unpleasant when he heard it before, and it was also unpleasant to hear it now.</span></p><p><span style="">He felt repulsed by this person, who tried to bring about a desired result as he covered his ass.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I&#x2019;ll hear you out.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin was sure Toppler was hiding something. &#xA0;However, if the situation called for it, he would make an alliance with this awkward bastard. &#xA0;He wanted to hear about the dangers he would have to face in the near future.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;For a very long time, we kept surveillance on those, who possessed the Admin Codes. &#xA0;We&#x2019;ve done this several dozen times, yet there was someone, who always strived to become the Supreme Being.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;A Supreme Being&#x2026;.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Is that the end game? &#xA0;Was this what the Dimensional lords were struggling so much to reach? &#xA0;One had to look at the person closest to reaching the goal.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I&#x2019;m guessing you are referring to the 72nd Throne.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I&#x2019;m pretty sure you met him before.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What? I did?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin tilted his head in confusion.</span></p><p><span style="">When Woojin&#x2019;s gaze settled on him, Dr. Toppler gulped as he spoke. &#xA0;Everything would end once he descends.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I&#x2019;m talking about the Dimensional Admin.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">He oversaw everything. &#xA0;When he gathers all the Codes that makes everything possible, he would be born-again as the Supreme Being.</span></p><p><span style="">He&apos;ll merge all the Dimensions together&#x2026;. &#xA0;&#xA0;He&#x2019;ll be a god of everything.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;Dimensional Admin?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin thought about his meeting from before. &#xA0;He had been summoned to Alphen without any notice, and he had worked hard to return to earth.</span></p><p><span style="">His efforts had been basically like clawing out of a hole, and he had been able to meet the Dimensional Admin.</span></p><p><span style="">With his help, Woojin was able to return to earth.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Your words make no sense. &#xA0;Why would that bastard return me to earth&#x2026;.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Before Woojin could end his sentence, Dr. Toppler gave a reply. &#xA0;He didn&#x2019;t have much time left. &#xA0;Captain Leone should be arriving at the Seoul Station right about now.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;You possess the Code and key he needs.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;&#x2026;&#x2026;.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;An innate Code was scattered. &#xA0;You possess the Deletion Code&#x2026; &#xA0;The Dimensional Admin is trying to get his hands on the completed Deletion Code.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;You are talking about Thrash&#x2019;s power.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Correct. &#xA0;He wants to possess all the Codes.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">In the virtual reality world, humans were mere files. &#xA0;When one died, one was deleted.</span></p><p><span style="">There was a space where the dead gathered. &#xA0;Woojin was an existence that could revert the deletion by pulling the dead from that space.</span></p><p><span style="">Necromancer.</span></p><p><span style="">The strange sense of dissonance that had bothered him lightened. &#xA0;Was it because his vague goals had been clarified?</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;All right. &#xA0;Tell me what you want.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;He is about to descend. &#xA0;We would have had to complete our task before that happened, so we&#x2019;ve already missed our opportunity. &#xA0;The virtual earth has no hope any more. &#xA0;We have to do a new Reset.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Tell me how you&#x2019;ll pull this off.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;The people of the Moon World will log you out. &#xA0;When you wake up, the memories embedded in the Code will give you the instructions.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">It was like opening a Skill Book. &#xA0;It would be as if the knowledge was placed in one&#x2019;s mind&#x2026;. &#xA0;It was similar, yet it was also different&#x2026; &#xA0;It was akin to memories being unsealed.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;The method would be embedded in the Recovery Code you gained from Iello.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">When he killed Iello, he had gained the Recovery Code.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;You have to do something before you can do that.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What is it?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;When the recovery occurs, the dead people will come back to life.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Time would be reverted in wholesale. &#xA0;It was basically like a roll back. &#xA0;Everything would be reverted to a previous checkpoint. &#xA0;Meanwhile, the residue created by this action would create Dimensional refugees or beings that would wander some unknown space&#x2026;.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;If you want to recover earth, you need Earth&#x2019;s Code.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;&#x2026;&#x2026;.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;You have to take it.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin stood still, and he didn&#x2019;t budge an inch.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;She&#x2019;ll be reborn again. &#xA0;You don&#x2019;t have to hesitate.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hooo.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">At Toppler&#x2019;s heartfelt plea, Woojin just replied with laughter.</span></p><p><span style="">His anger settled into something cold&#x2026;. &#xA0;&#xA0;This was why his gaze caused goosebumps as it headed towards Toppler.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Just think of those words as your last will.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Please think&#x2026;&#x2026;.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">He wouldn&#x2019;t change his mind. &#xA0;Toppler could see it in Kahng-woojin&#x2019;s expression and he could hear it in his voice. &#xA0;Toppler could guess at his fate.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;There&#x2019;s no other way except for a Reset&#x2026;.. &#xA0;&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Toppler couldn&#x2019;t give a solution to the problem, but he had a way to prevent the worst case scenario. &#xA0;It was the only way forward.</span></p><p><span style="">Time had to be tampered, and the the problem had to be solved anew.</span></p><p><span style="">Shwahhhk.</span></p><p><span style="">Kahng-woojin swung his fist.</span></p><p><span style="">Instead of taking the test again, he chose to rip up the test.</span></p><p><span style="">Gwah-ahng!</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Please go!&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Kim-kahngchul blocked the path of Kahng-woojin, but Toppler didn&#x2019;t have time to be thankful or be touched by his action. &#xA0;He was only a Rank A Roused, so how many seconds would he be able to last against Kahng-woojin?</span></p><p><span style="">Toppler quickly ran to grab the handle to the restroom.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;We&#x2019;ll log you out soon. &#xA0;Please do not forget the words I told you.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Ggee-eek.</span></p><p><span style="">The door opened, and Toppler entered into the entrance. &#xA0;Woojin kicked Kim-kahngchul, who was holding onto his leg.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Let me go.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Kwah-ahng.</span></p><p><span style="">Kim-kahngchul was sent flying into the wall, and he ungainly rolled across the floor.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Oooh-ooh-oohk.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">The impact was too much. &#xA0;Kim-kahngchul didn&apos;t even think about getting up. &#xA0;He just moaned.</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin quickly grabbed the handle of the restroom&#x2019;s door. &#xA0;It had been quickly closed by Toppler.</span></p><p><span style="">Tuhk!</span></p><p><span style="">He felt someone grabbing at his thigh, so Woojin looked down. &#xA0;He saw a bloody face of Kim-kahngchul. &#xA0;It looked as if his head had been split open, yet he desperately grabbed at Woojin&#x2019;s leg.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;You are the only one. &#xA0;Please&#x2026; &#xA0;Save me.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Who will save whom?</span></p><p><span style="">It seemed everyone was thinking of themselves.</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin roughly kicked Kim-kahnchul away, and he opened the door to the restroom as if he was about to rip the door away.</span></p><p><span style="">Kwahng!</span></p><p><span style="">However, Dr. Toppler couldn&#x2019;t be seen across the door. &#xA0;The soulless and sneaky bastard had returned to his world.</span></p><p><span style="">He had used a Dimensional Shift without a Dungeon&#x2026;. &#xA0;No, should he call it a logout now?</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin glared at the blameless Kim-kahngchul.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;&#x2026;&#x2026;.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">From the tip of his toe to his head, he felt an extreme rage suffuse his entire body.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Our goals aren&apos;t the same.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Their goal was to block the descent of the Supreme Being and saving earth?</span></p><p><span style="">He had heard what the other side wanted. &#xA0;However, their goals wasn&#x2019;t his goals. &#xA0;Those bastards were delusional if they thought otherwise.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Reset? &#xA0;Huh!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">It was a non-starter for him. &#xA0;Go back and do what? &#xA0;He would have to go through the 20 years of wandering again, which had been extremely painful. &#xA0;Then he would have to return to earth to see it crumble.</span></p><p><span style="">His goal was different.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I&#x2019;ll end this.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">He didn&#x2019;t care what happened to the Moon World.</span></p><p><span style="">He&#x2019;ll protect earth. &#xA0;He&#x2019;ll destroy all the Dungeons. &#xA0;He&#x2019;ll cut the connection between Dimensions, and he&#x2019;ll make this his own earth&#x2026; &#xA0;He&#x2019;ll protect this earth.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I&#x2019;ll kill them all.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">He&#x2019;ll pursue a method that he was most confident about.</span></p><p><span style="">The only way to gain the Thrash&#x2019;s Executioner was through shedding Sooah&#x2019;s blood?</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I don&#x2019;t need it.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">He didn&#x2019;t care about the Executioner. &#xA0;He didn&#x2019;t need it even if it was the only viable method.</span></p><p><span style="">He&#x2019;ll become Thrash, and he&#x2019;ll execute all those bastards.</span></p><p><span style="">Woooooooo.</span></p><p><span style="">When he was filled with rage, Kahng-woojin was able to see the evil spirits that always hovered around him.</span></p><p><span style="">Their cries were chilling, yet Woojin&#x2019;s eyebrows didn&#x2019;t even twitch.</span></p><p><span style="">There were thousands upon thousands of evil spirits attached to him.</span></p><p><span style="">He couldn&#x2019;t even count how many.</span></p><p><span style="">He had always shouldered this burden.</span></p><p><span style="">The wailing evil spirits around him started to hide their presence as always. &#xA0;However, his situation was a bit different from before&#x2026;.</span></p><p><span style="">He divided them through the Trash&#x2019;s Set Item he wore.</span></p><p><span style="">Too-oohng.</span></p><p><span style="">Kahng-woojin stepped out of the room.</span></p>
