<p>Chapter 195 - Moon World (2)</p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Let&#x2019;s rest for a little bit.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes, hyung.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What is our winning streak?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;That was our 75th win in a row.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Jaemin didn&apos;t look too tired, so Woojin looked at him in surprise.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Aren&#x2019;t you tired?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Heh heh. &#xA0;We&#x2019;ve been playing this game for only a day.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes, a game&#x2026;.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin let out a bitter laugh at Jaemin&#x2019;s words.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;So shall we continue?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes. &#xA0;I&#x2019;ll rest when I get tired.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;You do that..&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin&#x2019;s only work was to fight the Dimensional lords, who requested Duels, because they lost the Dimensional Battle.</span></p><p><span style="">Only a very few warlike Dimensional lords requested Duels as revenge. &#xA0;Most didn&#x2019;t even bother avenging their losses in the Dimensional Battle.</span></p><p><span style="">When he saw Jaemin immerse himself into the Dimensional Battle once again, Woojin stood up from his seat.</span></p><p><span style="">He had been sitting on his Throne, and he had been buying Ingredient Items as soon as the Points started to come in. &#xA0;However, he had yet to complete a single Item.</span></p><p><span style="">After the earth finished its Synchronization, there was no time difference between earth and his Dimensional Domain. &#xA0;A day passed on earth if he spent a day inside his Dimensional Domain.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Shall I go back for a visit?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The Dimensional space between the planets was called the Dimensional Domain.</span></p><p><span style="">He was able to message between all the vassals of his Domain from this location. &#xA0;It didn&#x2019;t matter if it was Melody on Alphen or Bibi on Earth. &#xA0;However, none of them were contacting him, so it seemed nothing significant was occurring.</span></p><p><span style="">If a Duel request came in, Kiba could do it in his stead..</span></p><p><span style="">Once Kiba loses, Woojin could come back to avenge him.</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin stood in front of the Gate that would take him to Alphen&#x2019;s Saurus Colony.</span></p><p><span style="">Zeeeng.</span></p><p><span style="">After he passed through the Portal, he saw that nothing had changed at the Saurus Colony. &#xA0;He was a bit let down by the lack of progress.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What the hell? &#xA0;You are still in there?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The small flame was still burning, and Woojin shook his head as he looked at it.</span></p><p><span style="">Sunggoo was being too greedy. &#xA0;He was still in combustion.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;If you can hear me, you should come out. &#xA0;It is enough.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Hwah-roo-roohk.</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin couldn&#x2019;t tell if Sunggoo could hear him or not, since he was unable to speak. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">While everyone was making a big fuss about the Immortal&#x2019;s appearance, Melody pushed through the crowd.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Immortal.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">She seemed very glad to see him, so Woojin felt his mood improve.</span></p><p><span style="">Melody had been thrown away by the goddess she had served for her entire life, and she had lost her power. &#xA0;This did make him worry a little bit about her.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Anything unusual?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes. &#xA0;Somehow the number of Dimensional lords living in Alphen&#x2019;s Dungeons had noticeably decreased in number.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Several dozen Dungeons had been cleared.</span></p><p><span style="">The Resets were occurring from time to time, but most of the Dungeons were being purchased by low rank Dimensional lords. &#xA0;These were beings, who could barely buy a single Dungeon by investing all their resources.</span></p><p><span style="">Opponents of such caliber could be cleared by the heroes of the Coalition.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;It is understandable. &#xA0;From the bastards who could fly to the ones that could crawl, all are appearing on earth to make a mess.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The overall ability of the Roused, and the modern weapons made earth a superior fighting power compared to Alphen.</span></p><p><span style="">It looked as if earth was still holding up quite well. &#xA0;However, in the end, it would turn into a battle of attrition, and the Dimensional lords would win.</span></p><p><span style="">If one thought about the 200 year long war on Alphen, the Dimensional lords knew how to conduct a battle of attrition.</span></p><p><span style="">They had all the time they needed.</span></p><p><span style="">The only ones desperate was the people of earth, who had to defend their planet. &#xA0;Even the ones, who traveled from earth to Alphen, was feeling the same desperation.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;My king!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin smirked at the strong greeting he got from Blanka and the Phantom Unit.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;How&#x2019;s Haesol?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;She is awake.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">At the Phantom Unit&#x2019;s sub-commander Joonyong&#x2019;s words, Woojin started looking around for her.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Where is she?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;she left after leaving behind this letter.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Huh?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Joonyong gave the letter to Woojin.</span></p><p><span style="">The letter was short. &#xA0;However, it got the point across.</span></p><p><span style="">-I&#x2019;m useless right now. &#xA0;I&#x2019;d rather die than become a burden. &#xA0;I&#x2019;ll return after I become strong.</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin looked away from the letter, and he laughed.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Isn&#x2019;t this a suicide letter?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I...I don&#x2019;t think so.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What a pointless....&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin didn&#x2019;t want Haesol, because she was strong in battle. &#xA0;She was very knowledgeable about tactics and strategies. &#xA0;Moreover, her telepathic ability allowed her to run the Roused Unit in an efficient manner.</span></p><p><span style="">If she wanted to increase her battle capability, she should have increased the ability of the Phantom Unit&#x2026;.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Do you guys have anything to do these days?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What? &#xA0;I guess&#x2026;. It&#x2019;s been&#x2026;.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Then let&#x2019;s head back.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Blanka, who had been silent as he listened, asked the question.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What about us saving Alphen? &#xA0;We have to help them. &#xA0;We are allies now.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Earth is in bigger danger right now.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I want you guys to pack up. &#xA0;We are heading back.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Team leader Haesol isn&#x2019;t back yet.&#x2026;.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Well, she&#x2019;ll come back when she is ready.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin glanced at the flame.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;You shouldn&#x2019;t be late to the party either. &#xA0;Hurry up and come back to earth.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Hwah-roo-roohk.</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin was about to head immediately into the Gate when Melody hesitatingly stood in front of him.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What&#x2019;s wrong?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I have request for the Immortal-nim.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What is it?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;A Blessing&#x2026;. &#xA0;Could you give me a Blessing?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Huh?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin&#x2019;s eyes turned round at the unexpected words.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What the hell are you talking about?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Melody bit her lower lips. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">She might be barking up the wrong tree. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">However, the loss of her power had created an emptiness within her. &#xA0;The pain was almost unbearable.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I would like you to place the Thrash&#x2019;s Blessing on me&#x2026;.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hmmm.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin stroked his chin as he looked at her. </span></p><p><span style="">What did she think he was? &#xA0;How could he give her Thrash&#x2019;s Blessing?</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I&#x2019;m not a priest.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">He was speaking the truth.</span></p><p><span style="">However, he advanced the cause of the god&#x2026;.</span></p><p><span style="">He was closest to his god. &#xA0;At the very least, it looked like that to her eyes. &#xA0;This was why she was all the more desperate.</span></p><p><span style="">If Melody chose to worship a different god, would this other god accept her? &#xA0;She had been abandoned by Aria before.</span></p><p><span style="">No god would gladly accept her.</span></p><p><span style="">However, it might be possible if it was the Immortal.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;You can keep looking at me like a constipated dog, but I don&#x2019;t know how to do it.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;You just have to grant me your Blessing.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">What kind of Blessing was she talking about?</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin shook his head from side to side as he looked at her.</span></p><p><span style="">She was asking for it, so he&#x2019;ll attempt it.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I take no responsibility if this doesn&#x2019;t work.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I won&#x2019;t resent you.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin stood in front of her.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Kneel.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Melody gently got on her knees, and she lowered her head. &#xA0;&#xA0;He raised his hand, and he gripped her head.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Is this how I&#x2019;m supposed to do it?&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">He was doubtful, since he never thought about Thrash through the lens of religion. &#xA0;He had just seen himself as someone, who received an inheritance&#x2026;.</span></p><p><span style="">This was the first time trying his hand out on missionary work.</span></p><p><span style="">Of course, he didn&#x2019;t know how to do it. &#xA0;He didn&#x2019;t have any convention he could follow.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I name you as the priestess of Thrash.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">When Woojin&#x2019;s words ended, no change had occurred.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Well, I guess it didn&#x2019;t work?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">He unnecessarily felt bashful about this, so he scratched his head..</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Don&#x2019;t be too discouraged.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I...I&#x2019;m not.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">At that moment, the Phantom Unit gathered near the Gate.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;We are ready, my king.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;All right. &#xA0;Let&#x2019;s go.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Melody bowed towards Woojin.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Please be careful in getting back here. &#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Well, all right.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The Gate was going nowhere, so what problem could occur going back and forth from this place?</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I want you to take care of everything while I&#x2019;m gone.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Melody was the administrator of the Saurus Colony. &#xA0;She had yet to waste any Points. &#xA0;She actually used the existing soldiers of the Colony and the forces of the Coalition to gather Blood Stones. &#xA0;She had increased his Point total instead of using it.</span></p><p><span style="">The great lords of Trahnet had several dozen to several hundred Colonies. &#xA0;If they were all bringing in a surplus of Points, he could understand why the great lords was able to pour out monsters like it was nothing.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I&#x2019;ll be back.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">She kept her head down until he passed through the gate. &#xA0;She didn&#x2019;t have Aria&#x2019;s power of premonition anymore.</span></p><p><span style="">So why did it feel like she would never be able to see Kahng-woojin again?</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Please be victorious.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">She wished he would end the Dimensional war that had only brought them invasion and plunder&#x2026;.</span></p><p><span style="">*** </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hoo-ah. &#xA0;How long has it been since we&#x2019;ve been on earth?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;It&#x2019;s the Wyverns!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The Phantom Unit set foot on the flying fortress. &#xA0;Some were so moved by this experience that they kissed the floor.</span></p><p><span style="">The Phantom Unit were all trained as Wyvern Riders, so they were very familiar with the Wyvern&#x2019;s nest placed at the corner of deck.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;You are back?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Jung-minchan always came running out to greet him in haste, and Woojin always asked the same question.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Anything unusual?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;There was something.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What is it? Did Kim-kahngchul run away again?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;No.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Unlike his worries, Kim-kahngchul had behaved very well. &#xA0;He was still imprisoned inside the reception room.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;So what is it? Where&#x2019;s Bibi?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">He wondered if the Undead Army was struggling out there. &#xA0;However, his worries was off the mark.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;They have pretty much wrapped up the battlefield, and they are returning right now.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style=""> &#x201C;Then what is it?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;We caught a spy.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Jeez. &#xA0;I thought something big had happened.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin reacted as if this was a matter of no importance. &#xA0;Jung-minchan put on a serious expression, and he started looking around before he spoke in a whisper.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;This is related to Lee-sahngho. &#xA0;From my research, there hadn&#x2019;t been any volunteers to head towards Alphen. &#xA0;However, the Daken Guild suddenly stepped forward, because they struck a backroom deal with Lee-sahngho..&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Lee-sahngho? Who is that?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Jung-minchan calmly told him the information.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;He is the former Hwarang guild master, who was killed by your hands.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Is that so? Maybe he earned a Dimensional Fragment from somewhere.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin didn&#x2019;t show any surprise at this information, so Jung-minchan swallowed his musings.</span></p><p><span style="">Of course, this was a world where monsters were running amok. &#xA0;Should revival from death be that big of a deal in such context?</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;We haven&#x2019;t figured that out yet. &#xA0;However, the problem is the fact that Lee-sahngho is acting as spokesperson for a newly arrived Dimensional lord named Iello.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin tilted his head at Minchan&#x2019;s words.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;He became a vassal.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Lee-sahngho&#x2019;s revival now made sense.</span></p><p><span style="">A vassal&#x2019;s revival only needed consumption of Points. &#xA0;If Woojin didn&#x2019;t like the actions of Lee-sahngho, he just had to kill the Dimensional lord Iello.</span></p><p><span style="">However, was it worth going through with it?</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Please look at this.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Jung-minchan handed him a tablet. &#xA0;The screen held a footage of Seoul filmed from a distance.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I guess they haven&#x2019;t dismantled that thing yet.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">He had taken care of all the monsters, so he had thought the Korean government would take down the Thorn Tree. &#xA0;This was why he left it alone.</span></p><p><span style="">However, the Thorn Tree was frozen. &#xA0;On top of that, the Hahn river was also frozen.</span></p><p><span style="">On top of a frozen branch of the Thorn Tree, a doll made out of ice was talking as it opened both its arms.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;That&#x2019;s Iello?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Correct.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;He looks a bit familiar&#x2026;.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Please watch the next footage.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin played the next footage, and it was a closer shot. &#xA0;Lee-sahngho&#x2019;s voice could be heard.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x300C;Iello-nim wants to help the people of earth. &#xA0;He wants to protect the people of earth from the monsters from different Dimensions. &#xA0;This is akin to a god descending amongst&#x2026;..&#x300D; </span></p><p><span style="">After watching the footage of Lee-sahngho&#x2019;s speech, Woojin turned his gaze towards Minchan.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What is he talking about?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;it is as he said. &#xA0;The real problem is&#x2026;..&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What is it?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Several countries are already in progress of making a defense alliance.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;With him?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes&#x2026;.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Huh. &#xA0;They are giving a fish to a cat for safekeeping.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Lee-sahngho had been the one to cause the irregular Dungeon Breaks. &#xA0;Woojin had always wondered how he had pulled it off, but it seemed a Dimensional lord named Iello had been behind Lee-sahngho.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Where is he? &#xA0;Where&#x2019;s the spy?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;We put him in isolation.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Let&#x2019;s go.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin walked in front as he headed towards a room being used as a cell.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Where are we now?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;We are above Taiwan.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">In a flash, they were in front of the room where the spy was imprisoned.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Open the door.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Cheeeek.</span></p><p><span style="">When the closed steel door opened, a man with a worried expression caught sight of Kahng-woojin. &#xA0;His face quickly darkened.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I...I have nothing to say. &#xA0;You won&apos;t be able to make me talk&#x2026;.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Unlike his words, the man was shaking violently. &#xA0;Kahn-woojin swung an open palm.</span></p><p><span style="">Bbah-ahk!</span></p><p><span style="">The man couldn&#x2019;t tell if an open palm or a fist had impacted on his face. &#xA0;His lips broke open, and he was sent flying towards the corner of the room. &#xA0;Woojin grabbed the fallen man by his head. &#xA0;He held the man in front of him, so he could look into the man&#x2019;s eyes.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Name?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ooh ooh. &#xA0;It&#x2019;s Lee-soongho.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Good boy.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin relaxed the pressure he was putting on the man&#x2019;s head.</span></p><p><span style="">Lee-sahngho fell to the floor, and his teeth started to chatter.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hey Minchan. &#xA0;Give me &#xA0;your handphone.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes? &#xA0;Yes, sir.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">He took the handphone, and he pushed it towards the spy. &#xA0;The man&#x2019;s eyes shook from fear. &#xA0;Woojin laughed as he looked at him.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Call your president.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I heard you smashed your handphone. &#xA0;Call him with this one.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">When Lee-soongho&#x2019;s cover was blown, he immediately destroyed the handphone to get rid of the evidence.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hurry up. &#xA0;Call him.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Even such casual words carried an incredible amount of pressure. &#xA0;It was as if he was meeting a never before seen psychopath in this world. &#xA0;Woojin looked as if he was capable of killing a person as he laughed. &#xA0;Lee-soongho felt death creeping towards him&#x2026;..</span></p><p><span style="">It was like facing a god of legend, who harvested death..</span></p><p><span style="">Dee-ree-ree.</span></p><p><span style="">The phone rang couple times before Woojin heard a familiar voice.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x300C;Hello.&#x300D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;It&#x2019;s me.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x300C;Who&#x2019;s me?&#x300D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;It&#x2019;s Woojin.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x300C;Woojin?
