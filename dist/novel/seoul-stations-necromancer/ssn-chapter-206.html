There were so much thoughts entangled in his mind that it reached a point where he couldn&#x2019;t think about anything&#x2026;.</span></p><p><span style="">A sense of emptiness was left behind when he suddenly realized something.</span></p><p><span style=""> &apos;A lot of time has passed&apos;</span></p><p><span style="">He hadn&#x2019;t gone anywhere, and he hadn&#x2019;t moved.</span></p><p><span style="">He stood in one place as everything remained the same.</span></p><p><span style="">The amount of idle time he had might have drove him insane, but now he was moving farther away from it. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style=""> &apos;Thank you.&apos;</span></p><p><span style="">Several hundred to several thousand beings surrounded him.</span></p><p><span style="">He could feel each one of them.</span></p><p><span style="">It was a long enough time where he could have gotten lost, but he clearly felt them protect him at all times.</span></p><p><span style="">Evil spirits?</span></p><p><span style="">He had thought unblemished souls had fallen to torment him. </span></p><p><span style="">He had deluded himself to a ridiculous degree.</span></p><p><span style="">They had always been trying to protect him.</span></p><p><span style="">From what?</span></p><p><span style="">Pah-ah-aht.</span></p><p><span style="">Light pierced his eyes.</span></p><p><span style="">Eyes?</span></p><p><span style="">Did he really have them?</span></p><p><span style="">He had no body&#x2026;</span></p><p><span style="">He started thinking about the thoughts he couldn&#x2019;t perceive before. </span></p><p><span style="">He kept trying. &#xA0;He tried hard to recollect his memories.</span></p><p><span style=""> &apos;Kang-woojin.&apos;</span></p><p><span style=""> &apos;Immortal.&apos;</span></p><p><span style=""> &apos;Terraforming.&apos;</span></p><p><span style="">It felt as if scattered fragments of memory were being absorbed into him, and the pieces were being put together one by one. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">The only thing he found lacking was the fact that these fragments were pieces from two different boards.</span></p><p><span style=""> &apos;Who am I?&apos;</span></p><p><span style="">Was he a scientist, who used to research the Material Transfer System between planets?</span></p><p><span style="">Or was he the high school student, who was summoned to be the Necromancer on Alphen?</span></p><p><span style=""> &apos;I....&apos;</span></p><p><span style="">It was the beginning of a new world.</span></p><p><span style="">Nothing existed there, and it was a space where anything could be substantialized&#x2026; &#xA0;The ever expanding space were given owners, and they were split up in ranks&#x2026;.</span></p><p><span style="">Then there was the first supreme being, who had the authority to delete everything. &#xA0;He could destroy them all&#x2026;.</span></p><p><span style="">God of Destruction Thrash.</span></p><p><span style=""> &apos;I....&apos;</span></p><p><span style="">His chaotic fragments of memories were trying to fit into a single board, where space was getting sparse. &#xA0;These fragments clashed against each other, and they were being chipped away.</span></p><p><span style="">However, the board kept expanding, and these fragments eventually settled into place.</span></p><p><span style="">His soul... </span></p><p><span style="">His consciousness was being put back together clumsily&#x2026;.</span></p><p><span style="">They settled to form a bowl.</span></p><p><span style="">Pah-ah-aht!</span></p><p><span style="">He opened his eyes.</span></p><p><span style="">He blinked several times as he looked at his surrounding.</span></p><p><span style="">It was a familiar old castle.</span></p><p><span style=""> It was cozy and familiar.... </span></p><p><span style="">At the same time, he felt a powerful sense of repulsion&#x2026;..</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;H...hyung?&quot;</span></p><p><span style=""> Dongsaeng? </span></p><p><span style="">When he heard the strangely familiar voice, he turned to look.</span></p><p><span style="">It was a young man with white hair and sunken eyes.</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;Jaemin?&quot;</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;Yes, hyung! &#xA0;Are you ok?&quot;</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;.......&quot;</span></p><p><span style=""> He had no idea.</span></p><p><span style="">He didn&#x2019;t know if he was alright&#x2026;.</span></p><p><span style="">He was no longer sure...</span></p><p><span style="">He had no idea what he was.</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;Did you come back from the Moon World?&quot;</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;Moon World?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">He remembered it now. &#xA0;He insisted on going to the Moon World. &#xA0;He went there to find out the truth. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">He went there to find out, which world was the fake one.</span></p><p><span style="">It had been an attempt to protect his dongsaeng, and the nearby people, who were protecting her. &#xA0;He had tried to save earth.</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;How long have I been gone?&quot;</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;A fortnight.&quot;</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;.......&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Fortnight....</span></p><p><span style="">Kahng-woojin. </span></p><p><span style="">Kahng-woojin&#x2019;s memories started to speak to him.</span></p><p><span style="">His body&#x2019;s senses were slowly coming back, and it was also speaking to him.</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;I was dead.&quot;</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;What?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">His slow mind quickened. &#xA0;His stagnant memories started to connect to each other, and he understood the current situation.</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;What happened to earth?&quot;</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;...it is a mess. I&#x2019;ve been doing countless Dimensional battles to supply power to Bibi&#x2019;s Castle.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Since Kahng-woojin was absent, the tens of thousands within the Undead Army had to be maintained using the Colony&#x2019;s Points. &#xA0;Of course, these Points was also essential to the defense system of Bibi&#x2019;s Castle.</span></p><p><span style="">They were no longer gathering Bloodstones, and someone had to earn the Points. &#xA0;Do-jaemin had worked tirelessly to fill this role by doing Dimensional battles.</span></p><p><span style="">He plundered the Domain of other Dimensional lords, and whatever he gained was being used by Bibi&#x2019;s Castle.</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;I have to go.&quot;</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;What? Where?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin turned around.</span></p><p><span style="">The door that had been shut was opened.</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;It is a place I&#x2019;ve never been to.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">He had a feeling.</span></p><p><span style="">No, he was starting to recall a memory.</span></p><p><span style="">He didn&#x2019;t know if the memory was true, manufactured or a lie.</span></p><p><span style="">However, he felt that this was his only chance.</span></p><p><span style="">One could call it a hunch or maybe it could be called destiny.</span></p><p><span style="">There had been three doors lined up behind Kahng-woojijn&#x2019;s Dimensional Domain, and the third door, which had been barred, was opened..</span></p><p><span style="">***</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;What about the professor?&quot;</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;It seems he is having a hard time finding the exit.&quot;</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;Jeez.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Captain Leone had never been inside, so he couldn&#x2019;t go there himself. &#xA0;The plan had been to let someone else acquire the Code, and this person would be logged out by them.</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;Let&#x2019;s do a force logout.&quot;</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;Then he will never be able to connect to Trahnet ever again.&quot;</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;Isn&#x2019;t this already the endgame?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Even if Dr. Toppler was able to acquire Earth&#x2019;s Code, the Reset was already a failure. &#xA0;Even if they possessed the Recovery Code, Kahng-woojin&#x2019;s body was missing.</span></p><p><span style="">Since events had turned out like this, he had to awaken the professor as soon as possible. &#xA0;They needed to discuss about this problem.</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;The report has been sent.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Dr. Toppler&#x2019;s spaceship had been brought here, so he could use it after disconnecting from Trahnet.</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;We&#x2019;ll return to the base on the moon.&quot;</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;Yes, sir.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">When they received the order from Leone, his subordinates hurriedly prepared for takeoff.</span></p><p><span style="">Suddenly, one of his subordinates, who had been in charge of monitoring outside, yelled out.</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;Captain Leone. &#xA0;A living organism is approaching us.&quot;</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;What nonsense are you spouting!&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">What kind of a nonsense report was this?</span></p><p><span style="">How could there be any living beings left on earth?</span></p><p><span style="">There were people still alive, but they were all in the capsules&#x2026;.</span></p><p><span style="">The only ones, who could move freely on earth, was the soldiers on Leone&#x2019;s ship.</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;Is it a Guardian?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">If those nasty machine were able to exit the subway station, it might be... </span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;Please look at it yourself.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Captain Leone was at a loss for words when he looked at the screen pointed out by his subordinate. &#xA0;The screen displayed what the security camera was picking up. It really was a living organism.</span></p><p><span style="">Moreover, the being walking towards them looked humanoid.</span></p><p><span style="">The earth was completely devastated.</span></p><p><span style=""> It was year 2529, and a person, who was not of the Moon World, had appeared on earth.</span></p><p><span style="">This man of unknown identity wasn&#x2019;t wearing equipments that was needed to purify the air. &#xA0;Moreover, he was wearing a cloak made out of a piece of a straw mat. &#xA0;He looked like a vagrant seen in the old western films.</span></p><p><span style="">He was walking slowly towards them, and &#xA0;he looked very out of place on this current version of earth. &#xA0;The sense of incongruity increased the uneasiness and fear felt by the men.</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;What is it?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">They couldn&#x2019;t assume it was human just, because it was walking on its own two feet. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">Still, even if it was a human, not all humans were friendly and safe.</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;Sound the alarm!&quot;</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;Yes,sir!&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Everyone on Leone&#x2019;s ship were excellent soldiers. &#xA0;It took them mere seconds to arm themselves.</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;Open the hatch.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Pshhhhk.</span></p><p><span style="">Captain Leone was wearing a helmet, which filtered the air. &#xA0;He descended the spaceship with four armed men.</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;Stop.&quot;</span></p><p><span style=""> Captain Leone&#x2019;s warning rang out through the speakers. &#xA0;However, the unidentified lifeform didn&#x2019;t stop.</span></p><p><span style="">Too-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo!</span></p><p><span style="">Their opponent only stopped when they fired warning shots into the air. &#xA0;There was only 20 meters between them.</span></p><p><span style="">It was close enough to discern the identity of this being.</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;What the hell is it? &#xA0;Is he human?&quot;</span></p><p><span style=""> The Captain and his men kept the barrel of their guns trained on this man.</span></p><p><span style="">The man gave no answer, and Leone unconsciously gulped.</span></p><p><span style="">He felt fear, a sense of vigilance, and wariness.</span></p><p><span style="">This man wasn&#x2019;t showing any basic emotions even though he was in an unfamiliar surrounding. &#xA0;His attitude was overly bold. &#xA0;He acted as if he was the master of this place.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Are you human?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">However, there was no answer forthcoming in regards to his question. The only thing that had changed was the fact that the man started walking again.</span></p><p><span style="">He took one step after another.</span></p><p><span style="">This mysterious being was making Leone feel&#x2026; &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">Leone was barely able to push down the feeling any human would feel in this situation.</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;Stop!&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Too-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo!</span></p><p><span style="">Leone shot another round of warning shots into the air, yet the man didn&#x2019;t stop his advance.</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;Shit! &#xA0;Shoot.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Too-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo!</span></p><p><span style="">Light erupted from the barrel of the guns held by the soldiers.</span></p><p><span style="">The charged lazer quickly dropped in power reserves as it shot out.</span></p><p><span style="">Tee-dee-dee-deeng.</span></p><p><span style="">Instead of a blast, there was a strange sound of resonance as the lasers all missed. &#xA0;No, it was as if the attacks were being deflected by a barrier. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;What the hell!&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Leone pulled out the pistol from his holster on his waist in an agitated manner. &#xA0;&#xA0;Instead of a laser, this gun was a primitive gun. &#xA0;It used gun powder.</span></p><p><span style="">Tah-ahng, tahng!</span></p><p><span style="">The bullets flew true, but it was deflected into the sky before it was able reach the forehead of the man.</span></p><p><span style="">Tah-ahng, tah-ahng!</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;Eeek....&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Leone had more bullets left, but he could no longer fire it. &#xA0;The man was right in front of Leone. &#xA0;The man pushed his face forward. &#xA0;It was as if he was daring Leone to pull the trigger.</span></p><p><span style="">Leone spoke as if a gun was pointed right at his forehead.</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;W...who are you?&quot;</span></p><p><span style=""> Leone couldn&#x2019;t hide his trembling voice as he asked the question.</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;Are you guys from the Moon World?&quot;</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;.......&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">He knew the language that had come out from the man&#x2019;s mouth.</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;Where&#x2019;s Toppler?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Leone carefully deconstructed the man&#x2019;s face in front of him.</span></p><p><span style="">He had seen this man&#x2019;s face during a briefing. &#xA0;This man was one of the targets, who was essential to their plan.</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;Kahng-woojin....&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Leone didn&#x2019;t know how this was possible, but Kahng-woojin had appeared on earth.</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;You really logged out through your own effort....&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Leone mumbled to himself, and Kahng-woojin bared his white teeth as he laughed.</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;It seems I&#x2019;m at the right place.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">The people of Moon World had been phantoms to him, but now they were revealed in front of him.</span></p><p><span style="">He could most definitely feel them. &#xA0;He could feel Leone&#x2019;s&#x2026; &#xA0;He could feel the souls of the soldiers behind Leone.</span></p><p><span style="">***</span></p><p><span style="">He was tethered to an antenna that looked like a pole. &#xA0;It had been four days, and he was hanging there like a corpse.</span></p><p><span style="">The unidentified Dimensional lord, who was now being called the Black Armor, razed China to the ground. &#xA0;It had come straight towards Alandal, and a fight occurred above the Yellow Sea. &#xA0;The fight was still ongoing after four days.</span></p><p><span style="">Poo-ahhhhhh!</span></p><p><span style="">The water dragons were like the blue dragons from legend. &#xA0;They flew through the air as they let out their Dragon Breath. &#xA0;It was an imposing sight.</span></p><p><span style="">The problem was the fact that the Black Armor&#x2019;s power was beyond imagination.</span></p><p><span style=""> [Koo-hahahaha]</span></p><p><span style="">The fight&#x2026;.</span></p><p><span style="">The bastard enjoyed the act of destruction. &#xA0;&#xA0;The Black Armor was laid back as he fought the 17 Dragons, and the Dragons were being killed one by one.</span></p><p><span style="">The bastard didn&#x2019;t have any monsters as underlings. &#xA0;It fought alone, and the Undead army was gradually lessening in number.</span></p><p><span style="">Ironically, Dr. Toppler had the front seat in watching this fight.</span></p><p><span style="">Since the Necromancer wasn&#x2019;t present, the Undeads had to draw their energy from the Colony. &#xA0;This was why Bibi&#x2019;s Castle was never far away from the battlefield.</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;Do I have to watch the destruction of earth like this?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">The Reset was out of the question. &#xA0;All he could do was watch the revived absolute being eventually acquire the Earth&#x2019;s Code. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">They couldn&#x2019;t attempt the Reset anymore.</span></p><p><span style="">It would now be impossible to login to Trahnet from outside.</span></p><p><span style="">He could no longer predict the fate of the tens of thousands of people connected to Trahnet. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">Everything will now be in the hands of the absolute being. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">Any change to this world would follow the absolute being&#x2019;s will.</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;I made a mistake.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">The speaker&#x2019;s words were right. &#xA0;There had been too many variables.</span></p><p><span style="">The council had travelled the well beaten path for a reason, and they had been right.</span></p><p><span style="">He had acted rashly in meeting Kahng-woojin. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">He had created a butterfly effect that couldn&#x2019;t be contained.</span></p><p><span style="">The original plan was to conduct enough tests in regards to Terraforming. &#xA0;Then Iello would be awakened, and the Earth would have been Reset.</span></p><p><span style="">The fact that Alandal was able to withstand the assault by the absolute being for four days was astonishing. &#xA0;If Alandal fell, it would take less than a day for the earth to be razed to the ground.</span></p><p><span style="">There were no other opponent that could stand up to the absolute being.</span></p><p><span style="">Koo-ooh-oong!</span></p><p><span style="">The wounded Bone Dragon landed on the deck.</span></p><p><span style="">The control tower was the Colony&#x2019;s Symbol. &#xA0;The vines encasing the control tower let out a light as it expended energy. &#xA0;It quickly regenerated the Bone Dragon&#x2019;s wounds.</span></p><p><span style=""> [Give me wings!]</span></p><p><span style="">Hwee-ahhhhhhhhh!</span></p><p><span style="">After recovering its energy, Dolsae turned into a ball of blood as it encased the Bone Dragon.</span></p><p><span style="">Toppler had seen this sight for the seventh time.</span></p><p><span style="">The Blood Dragon was no match for the Black Armor. &#xA0;It could only prolong the inevitable. </span></p><p><span style="">Moreover, it seemed the Colony&#x2019;s energy was about to run out. &#xA0;The Undead army was being replenished at a much slower rate.</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;This is the end.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">The humans were exhausted, and there number of Undead had been reduced. &#xA0;The VR Earth was the last incubator of humanity, yet it was about come to an end.</span></p><p><span style="">Pah-paht.</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;Mmmm.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Dr. Toppler groaned as he saw his hands melt away into gray light. &#xA0;It seemed his associates were going to attempt a force logout.</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;I made a mistake.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">It was useless to feel regret over it. &#xA0;His relationship with Trahnet would end now. &#xA0;His role to save humanity had come to an end.</span></p><p><span style=""> Pah-pah-paht!</span></p><p><span style="">His faded consciousness returned, and his senses recovered at the same time. &#xA0;He opened his eyes.</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;Mmmm.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">He could see the lid of his capsule had been ripped away. &#xA0;When he raised his body, he saw a man, who was standing in front of him with his arms folded. &#xA0;Toppler became frightened when he saw the man, who was letting out an odd laugh. </span></p>
