<p><span style="">Chapter 187 - Breakeven Point (1)&#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">Daken guild&apos;s master Nakamura stood in front of the World Tree. &#xA0;He looked up at it.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;You were here, Nakamura.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Ah, monk Tauric.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Nakamura looked at Tauric with a bright smile on his face.</span></p><p><span style="">While Kahng-woojin was absent, Tauric was the most influential person in the Coalition.</span></p><p><span style="">He was Skia&apos;s First Monk.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Do you need something from me?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Ah. &#xA0;I was wondering when the next wave of troops will be dispatched.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Hmm... &#xA0;A single day on earth equals 4 days on Alphen. &#xA0;They should be here soon.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Oh. &#xA0;That is welcoming news.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Most of the population near Saurus mountain were mostly rescued. &#xA0;These were being of various races, who had joined the Coalition.</span></p><p><span style="">The Immortal&apos;s Undead army had exterminated all the monsters nearby, and they were marching south. &#xA0;When the allied forces from earth crosses over, they would be sent towards the north.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Anyways, I&apos;ve talked to everyone regarding the compensation...&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Tauric carefully brought up the subject.</span></p><p><span style="">The people of earth were putting their lives on the line by helping in the war. &#xA0;It wouldn&apos;t make sense if there were no compensation given for their help. &#xA0;Tauric was well aware of this fact. &#xA0;He couldn&apos;t help, but worry when Nakamura had brought up the proposal.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;How did it go?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Nakamura sounded as if he had high hopes, so Tauric replied in careful manner.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I have talked to the kings about transferring a portion of their territories. &#xA0;I&apos;ve gained consent from them. &#xA0;However, I&apos;m not sure how it will be divided up. &#xA0;How about we discuss it further when we regain half of the planet?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Hmmm.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Nakamura scratched his chin.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Well, all right. &#xA0;It would be a problem if our people broke up into factions to monopolize the reward.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Thank you for understanding.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;It is nothing... &#xA0;Of course, we&apos;ll help you all.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">At Nakamura&apos;s laugh, Tauric nodded his head.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;When the Immortal returns, you should discuss it with him.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;....&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Immortal Kahng-woojin.</span></p><p><span style="">In terms of the road to restoring Alphen, his merits were indisputable.</span></p><p><span style="">&apos;That little bastard is an eyesore.&apos;</span></p><p><span style="">Nakamura hadn&apos;t liked him when they came across each other in New York. &#xA0;Kahn-woojin had appeared wearing a sweatsuit. &#xA0;The bastard was arrogant.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Of course. &#xA0;We&apos;ll start organizing our military forces when the next wave is dispatched here.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Well, all right.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">When Tauric left, Nakamura let out a sneer.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Tsk tsk. &#xA0;How greedy...&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">The people of this planet didn&apos;t have the power to protect this land.</span></p><p><span style="">If they helped reclaim this land, it would be their land. &#xA0;Why should they give back the land to its old owners?</span></p><p><span style="">They should be thankful for having their lives spared...</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Hue hue. &#xA0;I look forward to it.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">If the Immortal was the problem, it wasn&apos;t as if he didn&apos;t have a solution.</span></p><p><span style="">Nakamura took out a purple gem, and he fiddled with it.</span></p><p><span style="">&apos;Lee-sahngho.&apos;</span></p><p><span style="">Lee-sahngho had suddenly appeared out of nowhere to propose a secret deal with him. &#xA0;Moreover, Lee-sahngho had given him a treasure.</span></p><p><span style="">It was the hottest Dungeon loot on earth right now. &#xA0;It was the &apos;Dimensional Fragment&apos;, and the research regarding this item was still ongoing.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Hue hue hue.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">As he looked up, he took in the sight of the World Tree. &#xA0;He couldn&apos;t help, but twitch when he saw the Symbol.</span></p><p><span style="">&lt;You&apos;ve discovered a ownerless Colony.&gt;</span></p><p><span style="">&lt;You are able to choose the option of Capture or Demolish.&gt;</span></p><p><span style="">It was a situation where his shoulders wanted to dance by itself.</span></p><p><span style="">How could the Immortal be so lax in his security?</span></p><p><span style="">He had never expected it. &#xA0;The Immortal had vacated his seat, and he hadn&apos;t appointed an admin for the Colony. &#xA0;Maybe, he thought no other Dimensional lords would approach this place....</span></p><p><span style="">&apos;It&apos;ll be the revival of the Great Japanese Empire.&apos;</span></p><p><span style="">Nakamura thought about the day when a man travelled from Korea to meet him.</span></p><p><span style="">***</span></p><p><span style="">Office of the Daken guild in Tokyo.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Shit! &#xA0;What is up with our second half sales?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">The executive officers were walking on eggshells as they listened to guild master Nakamura&apos;s cry of dismay.</span></p><p><span style="">The Daken guild were an assembly of Roused, who dealt in real estate and businesses that processed loot gained from Dungeons. &#xA0;They were sensitive about the recent results. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">They were in a market where there was an inexhaustible amount of competitors joining the market, and there was always a chance of other guilds, who started out late, catching up with the Daken guild.</span></p><p><span style="">One of the executive officers spoke carefully.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;The Blood Stone battery market is saturated right now, and our growth in that market has stalled. &#xA0;Of course, the Daken guild still has a bigger market share compared to our competitors.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Is that even worth mentioning? &#xA0;The US already has several dozen patents for Blood Stone weapons. &#xA0;How can we be satisfied with cornering a single market for batteries?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;.....&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Another executive officer attempted to put Nakamura&apos;s anger to sleep by proposing an idea.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;How about we participate in the expedition being sent to Alphen?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Is that even worth mentioning right now?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;The risk is high, but the reward will also be great.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">A large sums of money were needed to conduct a war.</span></p><p><span style="">Will they be able to convert the use of their human and material resources into money? &#xA0;It wasn&apos;t an exaggeration to say that there was an astronomical cost to conduct a war.</span></p><p><span style="">The expedition to Alphen would be dangerous.</span></p><p><span style="">Moreover, this was a venture being led by the Alandal guild. &#xA0;If they unnecessarily got involved in this, there was a chance that they&apos;ll gain minimal profit, while suffering losses.</span></p><p><span style="">If they helped save Alphen by defeating the monsters, what would they gain? &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">Gratitude?</span></p><p><span style="">Respect?</span></p><p><span style="">Those were all useless.</span></p><p><span style="">They wouldn&apos;t move, since this venture wasn&apos;t profitable. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">Since there were a lot of risk involved, they just have to move if everyone on earth participated in the venture.</span></p><p><span style="">The conference room was filled with silence and irritation when the secretary spoke into Nakamura&apos;s ear.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;The person, who contacted us last time, has arrived.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Mmmm.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">After he looked around the conference room, he let out an angry scolding.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I don&apos;t care if it is a plane or whatever. I want you to come up with a plan to make money in any way possible. &#xA0;The most important point is to stay ahead of the game!&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">After laying out those harsh truths, he left the conference room. &#xA0;His secretary followed close behind him.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Did he bring the item?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;He said he&apos;ll let us check it after he met with the guild master.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Mmmm.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">It was in regards to the hottest issue that affected the world of the Roused. &#xA0;Alandal and a limited number of countries had earned this item, and they were conducting research on it. The Daken guild also used multiple avenues to gather information on this item, and they also wanted to be an owner of a Dimensional Fragment.</span></p><p><span style="">In the end, they had gotten in contact with a broker, and the deal was to be concluded today.</span></p><p><span style="">After entering the reception room, Nakamura smiled at a man wearing a magician&apos;s robe. &#xA0;His hood kept his face hidden.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Thank you for travelling such a long distance to meet me. &#xA0;Are you an errand boy or an avatar?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">When the question was spoken, the man sitting on the sofa took off his hood in a leisurely way.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;My name is Lee-sahngho.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Hmmm. &#xA0;I didn&apos;t ask you for your name...&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Do you know of Korea&apos;s Hwarang guild?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;You.... &#xA0;How...&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">This man had been killed. &#xA0;How could a dead man be standing in front of him?</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;You don&apos;t have to be surprised. &#xA0;It is true that I did die. &#xA0;I was merely revived.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;.....&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">The words were so shocking that Nakamura was having a hard time believing in it. &#xA0;In a flash, his brain thought through dozens of ways this man could have disguised himself.</span></p><p><span style="">Who was he really speaking to?</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;You don&apos;t have to think too hard on it.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;.....&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Before Nakamura could calm his startled heart, Lee-sahngho took out an item from his pocket.</span></p><p><span style="">He took out two purple gems.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;This one is called the Dimensional Proof, and this one is the Dimensional Fragment.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;....!&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">He had thirsted for this Item, yet this man had readily brought it out like this? &#xA0;Who was he really speaking to? &#xA0;No, how was he supposed to comprehend such extraordinary topics such as death and revival....</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;You&apos;ve acquired what you wanted, and now you&apos;ll have to give me something I want. &#xA0;There is no reason why we shouldn&apos;t both benefit from this deal.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;....&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Nakamura&apos;s eyes shook as he looked at the Dimensional Proof. &#xA0;He had no idea what it was used for, but a very strong magical energy was being emitted from it.</span></p><p><span style="">The purple color caught his eyes, and it was as if his heart was mesmerized by it.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;What do you want?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I want you to go to Alphen, and I want you to steal a Colony.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;...what do you gain from that?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Tsk. &#xA0;You ask too many questions. &#xA0;It is simple. &#xA0;I want you to steal Kahng-woojin&apos;s Colony.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;....&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Nakamura&apos;s forehead furrowed as he quickly made his calculations. &#xA0;Every movement of Kahng-woojin had been in the headlines every day, so a lot was known about him.</span></p><p><span style="">Amongst the rumors, he remembered there was one about Lee-sahngho dying at the hands of Kahng-woojin....</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;...it&apos;ll be difficult to go against Alandal..&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">No matter how he thought about it, there was no benefit for him to stab Alandal in the back. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Hue hue.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Nakamura felt a chill run up his back at Lee-sahngho&apos;s laugh. &#xA0;Lee-sahngho was known to be a mere Rank B Roused.</span></p><p><span style="">However, he exceeded Nakamura in terms of the power he was emitting. &#xA0;He surpassed a Rank A Roused...</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;You&apos;ll be able to gain eternal life, so what is the downside?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Eternal life...&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Nakamura&apos;s gaze rested on the Dimensional Proof. &#xA0;He slowly raised his hand to grab it.</span></p><p><span style="">***</span></p><p><span style="">Jeju&apos;s Manjang Cave.</span></p><p><span style="">It was hard to hide the cold energy anymore. &#xA0;Even the cave&apos;s entrance was frozen solid. &#xA0;Lee-sahngho, who had exceeded the constitution of a normal person, walked the road inside the cave without much discomfort.</span></p><p><span style="">When he reached the heart of the cave, he saw a throne with the ice humanoid Iello sitting on top of it.</span></p><p><span style="">Lee-sahngho kowtowed in front of it.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;My master.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;What happened to your plan?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;There is no way the Immortal will be able to return to earth.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;You seem very sure of yourself.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;...you can put your trust in me. &#xA0;I&apos;ve put in second and third fail-safe in my plan.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;....&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Even if he was prostrated on the floor, he could feel Iello&apos;s gaze. &#xA0;When his body started to shake from fear, Iello spoke.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;All right. &#xA0;I&apos;ll put my trust in you.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;T...thank you.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Lee-sahngho had died before, so he had lost his Code.</span></p><p><span style="">Since he wasn&apos;t an earthling anymore, he could only rely on Iello now. &#xA0;Only his absolute loyalty to Iello would ensure his survival.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Did you find earth&apos;s god?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Not yet...&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Lee-sahngho, who was afraid, spoke in a small voice.</span></p><p><span style="">He was afraid of Iello&apos;s scolding, but unexpectedly, Iello was silent. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">No, he even started to speak in a warm tone.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;If you were able to block the Immortal&apos;s return, you can be slower with the search. &#xA0;It is time for me to step forward.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;What?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Iello had been hiding for all this time, yet he was going to step out now.... &#xA0;&#xA0;Did this mean he was going to take over the world using an army of monsters?</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Soon, all the Dimensional lords will appear to take down the god of earth. &#xA0;I have to make preparations.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">What preparations was he talking about? &#xA0;Didn&#x2019;t he have to find earth&apos;s god&apos;s first?</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;...your servant is ignorant. &#xA0;I cannot discern what you wish to do.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;It won&apos;t just be destruction and slaughter. &#xA0;I&apos;ll rule.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;....&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I&apos;ll rule over the people of earth.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Lee-sahngho&apos;s thoughts spun quickly.</span></p><p><span style="">The Synchronization would be finished soon.</span></p><p><span style="">There would no longer be any restriction as the Dimensional lords would come to earth to take down the god of earth. &#xA0;Would anyone be able to stop them?</span></p><p><span style="">It was unlikely, since the Immortal&apos;s Gate would be lost soon. &#xA0;Kahng-woojin wouldn&apos;t be able to come back to earth.</span></p><p><span style="">In such a period of chaos, what if a selfless hero made himself known....</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Ah...&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">He didn&apos;t care about the hidden meaning behind Iello&apos;s words. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">Which mask should he wear? &#xA0;Should he become an invader? &#xA0;Or should he become one of the rescuers?</span></p><p><span style="">Iello was gathering his strength, and he was biding his time.</span></p><p><span style="">He&apos;ll wait until the people of earth needed his help....</span></p><p><span style="">***</span></p><p><span style="">One week passed at the Saurus Colony.</span></p><p><span style="">The promised time had passed, yet there had been no additional forces sent across to Alphen. &#xA0;Daken Guild&apos;s master Nakamura looked to be flustered by the situation.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;It seems there must have been a problem in dispatching the next wave of troops.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;A problem?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Mmm. &#xA0;I&apos;m not sure. &#xA0;Mr. Kahng-woojin is the one with the authority over the Gate. &#xA0;Since he isn&apos;t here, I can really go back and check...&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;That is a problem.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Unlike his words, Tauric wasn&apos;t feeling impatient. &#xA0;He would be thankful if earth helped, but the reclamation of Alphen could be done with only Kahng-woojin present. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">Currently, they didn&apos;t really need the help of the earthlings.</span></p><p><span style="">The Undead army was getting larger as time passed, and at some point, all the monsters on Alphen would be eradicated.</span></p><p><span style="">Of course, new Dimensional lords and monsters would keep showing up as long as the Dungeons existed. &#xA0;This was why it was imperative for the Coalition and the earthlings to be able to clear the Dungeons before it could link.</span></p><p><span style="">There were too many Dungeons on Alphen, and the Coalition forces were too few in number. &#xA0;Even Kahng-woojin couldn&apos;t solve this problem.</span></p><p><span style="">This was a job that need a large number of Roused and the heroes of the Coalition.</span></p><p><span style="">Unlike his frustrated outer appearance, Nakamura was laughing inside.</span></p><p><span style="">&apos;There is no troops being dispatched.&apos;</span></p><p><span style="">There were no additional troops being dispatched in the first place.</span></p><p><span style="">They were the only ones that had been planned to travel through the Gate. &#xA0;Earth did not have any additional plans of sending more troops.</span></p><p><span style="">&apos;Our research is complete.&apos;</span></p><p><span style="">He had separated people into groups. &#xA0;There were the people he&apos;ll take as hostages. &#xA0;Then there were the people he will share profits with. &#xA0;The last group were the people that will work under his rule.</span></p><p><span style="">The leading members of the Kingdoms and Tauric were all present right now. &#xA0;This was the best time to enact his plan.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Hmmm. &#xA0;Team leader Che-haesol? &#xA0;Please come over here.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Nakamura had a bright smile on his face as he called over Che-haesol, who was the leader of the Phantom Unit. &#xA0;She was the first one he had to eliminate.</span></p><p><span style="">Nakamura&apos;s request came out of nowhere, so Haesol answered him with a sour expression. </span></p><p><span style="">&quot;If you have something to say, you should come to me.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;....&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">It seemed the underlings were as arrogant as Alandal&apos;s president.</span></p><p><span style="">Yes, he&apos;ll go to her.</span></p><p><span style="">Nakamura approached Haesol with a smile on his face.</span></p>
