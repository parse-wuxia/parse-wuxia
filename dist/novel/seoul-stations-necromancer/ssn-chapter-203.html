<p>Chapter 203 - The Boundary between Reality and Virtual Reality (1)</p><p><span style="">Meeting Room inside Bibi&#x2019;s Castle Control Tower.</span></p><p><span style="">The news was running on the large monitor. &#xA0;The voice of the news anchor rang out inside the silent room.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x300C;An explosion of unknown cause has created a large sandstorm inside the Gobi desert. &#xA0;A research team was dispatched to see if a Dungeon Break had occurred nearby. &#xA0;We have a satellite image taken right before the explosion&#x2026;.. &#xA0;Our next story&#x2026;.&#x300D; </span></p><p><span style="">In the past, this story would have been treated like breaking news. &#xA0;However, it was now being treated as a passing news story.</span></p><p><span style="">There were too many Dungeon Breaks occurring everywhere now. &#xA0;It wasn&#x2019;t treated as breaking news unless a Dimensional lord powerful enough to destroy a country had appeared.</span></p><p><span style="">The people of Alandal was looking at a figure within the blurry satellite image. &#xA0;Their expression didn&#x2019;t look too good.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Doesn&#x2019;t that look like our king?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Mmmm&#x2026;.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Woo-soonghoon&#x2019;s words broke the silence, but everyone fell silent again.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Uh? There are more details on the internet.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The explosion at the Gobi desert was a nuclear weapon level explosion, and the related information was being quickly uploaded onto the internet.</span></p><p><span style="">There was also a video being circulated aside from the satellite image.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x300C;Oh shit! &#xA0;What the hell? &#xA0;It&#x2019;s a pegasus.&#x300D;</span></p><p><span style="">The person filming the footage spoke as he recorded the sight of the Phantom Steed streaking across the sky.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Isn&#x2019;t that Shing Shing?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Correct&#x2026;.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Where was this filmed?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The description under the video said it originated from China.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;All right. &#xA0;It says he was heading west.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;&#x2026;.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Jung-minchan was silent for a brief moment before he asked the question.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;He&#x2019;s still alive, right?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Of course, he is. &#xA0;Our king was fine after taking a direct hit from a missile. &#xA0;Ha ha.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">At Woo-soonghoon&#x2019;s words, everyone&#x2019;s expression relaxed a little bit.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Master is alive. &#xA0;I still exist.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Ah, of course.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">A definite sense of relief was felt when they heard Bibi&#x2019;s words.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Whew. &#xA0;Recently, I don&#x2019;t know why, but every little incident makes me anxious.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Minchan was barely able to calm his racing heart. &#xA0;It was akin to letting a child play near the river. &#xA0;Whenever Woojin went somewhere, he became anxious.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;So did he go to the Moon World or whatever?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">At times, Woojin went to visit his Dimensional Domain or Alphen. &#xA0;So his absence wasn&#x2019;t a surprise. &#xA0;However, they were afraid of the piece of truth he&#x2019;ll bring back.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I guess so. &#xA0;What happens if this place is really a virtual reality?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">At Soonghoon&#x2019;s worried voice, Minchan spoke in a low voice.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;That means we aren&#x2019;t real either.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hmmm&#x2026;.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">If the virtual reality disappeared, would only the Roused wake up in reality?</span></p><p><span style="">Minchan, Soonghoon and Haemin weren&#x2019;t Roused. &#xA0;They had a complicated expression on their faces as they kept their silence.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x300C;This is breaking news. &#xA0;The members of a Chinese guild called Limsum guild was dispatched to investigate the explosion that had occurred at the Gobi desert. &#xA0;All communications with the team was severed. &#xA0;This footage was sent before&#x2026;.&#x300D; </span></p><p><span style="">As the anchor spoke, the footage filled the screen.</span></p><p><span style="">The dust clouded the field of vision. &#xA0;It was as if one was walking within a fog.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x300C;I detect a strong magical energy in front of us.&#x300D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x300C;Clear this away.&#x300D;</span></p><p><span style="">Soonghoon understood Chinese as if he was a native to the language. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">The Roused used his power to stop the flow of air. &#xA0;Afterwards, he gathered the dust in a single location, and he sent it away.</span></p><p><span style="">When the field of vision cleared, one could see a large doll standing in place. &#xA0;It was wearing an armor that looked like a vest.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Is it a Golem?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">It didn&#x2019;t look like a human. &#xA0;Moreover, it didn&#x2019;t look like any of the analogous races. &#xA0;It looked more like an inorganic object than a living being.</span></p><p><span style="">It looked like a Golem similar to Dolsae.</span></p><p><span style="">The unique characteristic of its body was the fact that the body was made out of a black substance that made it impossible to tell if it had a solid or a liquid body. &#xA0;It was roiling as the substance moved like oil.</span></p><p><span style="">It looked like a clump of oil. &#xA0;It also looked like a collection of black clouds.</span></p><p><span style="">However, the important part was what happened afterwards.</span></p><p><span style="">Hooooong. &#xA0;Kwahng!</span></p><p><span style="">The strange monster swung his hand, and all the members in front was sent flying after being hit by a force.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x300C;Koo-koo-koohk.&#x300D;</span></p><p><span style="">It let out a bizarre laugh. &#xA0;The person holding the camera was dead, and the footage shook as the camera was dropped to the floor. &#xA0;The camera was lodged in the ground, and the footage came to an end.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x300C;The Chinese authorities are assuming that this being is a new Dimensional lord. &#xA0;They are in the process of gathering a special task force. &#xA0;Moreover, they are thinking about approving the use of a tactical nuke&#x2026;.&#x300D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Huhk. &#xA0;What the hell? &#xA0;They are thinking about using a tactical nuke over that?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Minchan was showing his dismay over the news when an employee ran in.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Prime Minister. &#xA0;The Chinese government is asking for our assistance.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Is it because of that?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">A still image of the monster was filling the screen. &#xA0;When Minchan pointed at it, the employee nodded his head.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I believe so. &#xA0;The situation is much worse than what the news is reporting. &#xA0;The monster is bulldozing through cities as it destroys everything in its path. &#xA0;&#xA0;It has already reached the western region of Zhangjjakou.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;isn&#x2019;t it traveling way too fast?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;The more important fact is that our king isn&#x2019;t here.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;That&#x2019;s true.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Kim-haemin quickly minimized the news as the screen of the computer was projected. &#xA0;His expression hardened after opening up a map.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;It is traveling in a straight line.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Jung-minchan groaned as he looked at the red line.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Mmmm. &#xA0;It is almost at Beijing. &#xA0;I can see why they are so nervous.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;No, you should look beyond it.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Kim-haemin spoke with a serious expression. &#xA0;The flight path was was extended in a straight line, and the line came to an end at a city.</span></p><p><span style="">Minchan&#x2019;s expression stiffened as it turned cold.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Seoul&#x2026;. No, is it aiming for us?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">It was an uneasy prediction, but he somehow felt he was right.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;An incredible bastard appeared accompanying an explosion and the king went missing...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">He had been barely able to tamp down his anxiousness, yet the feeling was getting larger again.</span></p><p><span style="">A different employee ran into the room.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Prime Minister. &#xA0;South Korea is on the line. &#xA0;There&#x2019;s been a large Break in Busan. &#xA0;They are asking for help.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Prime Minister. &#xA0;New York has...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Employees kept coming in with a phone in their hand. &#xA0;Minchan massaged his temple as he watched them.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;The king isn&#x2019;t here, so what can we do&#x2026;..&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Kahng-woojin was a one man army. &#xA0;Kahng-woojin was missing, and it was as if the monsters all over the world had agreed to go crazy all at once.</span></p><p><span style="">This hell like world was a problem if it was the real world. &#xA0;It was a problem if it was a fake world.</span></p><p><span style="">***</span></p><p><span style="">It felt as if his limbs were missing. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">No, was his entire body gone?</span></p><p><span style="">He started having auditory hallucinations.</span></p><p><span style="">Help me.</span></p><p><span style="">Please don&apos;t abandon us.</span></p><p><span style="">You could have protected them! </span></p><p><span style="">Don&apos;t go!</span></p><p><span style="">I want to live. &#xA0;Please save me.</span></p><p><span style="">Faces brushed by him.</span></p><p><span style="">These were familiar voices and shapes&#x2026;.</span></p><p><span style="">Was he dreaming again?</span></p><p><span style="">Was he being tormented by the vicious evil spirits again?</span></p><p><span style="">His vision was blurry, and he could see the despairing souls approach Woojin. &#xA0;The souls were tangled up with each other, and it was a sight that could probably be seen in hell. &#xA0;They started to touch his body.</span></p><p><span style="">It felt itchy and hot.</span></p><p><span style="">The funny part was that he no longer had a body.</span></p><p><span style="">He was conscious, and he had self awareness. &#xA0;However, he couldn&#x2019;t feel his body. &#xA0;It was as if he had melted into the air, and the only thing he could see around him were the evil spirits.</span></p><p><span style="">He watched them swipe at the empty air, and he felt some unidentifiable emotion. &#xA0;Maybe this was a wish he had desired for all this time.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;It&#x2019;s freedom.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">It felt as if he had been freed from everything that had been put on his shoulders. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">Release.</span></p><p><span style="">In this state, he felt as if he would be able to run away from the outcry of the evil spirits.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;I&#x2019;ll leave.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">He tried to leave. &#xA0;He was about to leave, but&#x2026;.</span></p><p><span style="">Hwahhhk.</span></p><p><span style="">A butterfly flew in, and it landed in front of Woojin. &#xA0;It slowly fluttered its wing as dusts scattered into the air. &#xA0;Soon, the butterfly disappeared, and a girl took its place.</span></p><p><span style="">Her face was familiar. &#xA0;She was the girl sacrificed in the terror attack.</span></p><p><span style="">Thank you.</span></p><p><span style="">The armless corpse, who had crawled across the ground, had reappeared in front of Woojin. &#xA0;She coalesced from dust, and the arms she lost in death was back. &#xA0;She looked normal.</span></p><p><span style="">It has been an honor to fight with you.</span></p><p><span style="">He remembered him.</span></p><p><span style="">During his mercenary days, he was a free knight, who had fought with Woojin in the battlefield.</span></p><p><span style="">The old man bleeding from the head solidified from smoke, and he bowed towards Woojin.</span></p><p><span style="">I do not resent you.</span></p><p><span style="">His memory was fuzzy. &#xA0;These were people, who had died by his hands....</span></p><p><span style="">The tormenting evil spirits reverted back to the appearance they held at the time time of their deaths. &#xA0;They appeared in front of his eyes.</span></p><p><span style="">They all bowed towards him as they smiled. &#xA0;Woojin was swept up by an unidentifiable feeling, and he had no idea what expression he should put on his face.</span></p><p><span style="">Thank you for not giving up on us.</span></p><p><span style="">Each of them spoke similar words to him.</span></p><p><span style="">He felt sorry, because he hadn&#x2019;t been able to protect them&#x2026;.</span></p><p><span style="">This was the space of emptiness.</span></p><p><span style="">The state of his body was uncertain&#x2026; &#xA0;He was unable to perceive himself in this space, yet the souls surrounding him confirmed his existence.</span></p><p><span style="">These were the lives, who he hadn&#x2019;t been able to protect. &#xA0;They were all looking at him.</span></p><p><span style="">As if they were protecting him&#x2026;..</span></p><p><span style="">***</span></p><p><span style="">Leone&#x2019;s ship landed at a desolate basin.</span></p><p><span style="">Psssshk.</span></p><p><span style="">The door opened, and armed soldiers wearing gas masks descended the stairs.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;We are ready to wheel him out, captain.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">A cart was floating in the air. &#xA0;It was akin to the ones that were used to transport patients. &#xA0;It was questionable to call it a stretcher, but all the preparations were complete.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Has the professor contacted us?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;The professor failed to convince him.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Mmmm.&quot;&apos;</span></p><p><span style="">Captain Leone let out a groan as he activated the device on his wrist. &#xA0;A holographic screen came alive, and one could see Dr. Toppler.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Professor. If he doesn&#x2019;t have the Code, it&#x2019;ll be meaningless to log him out.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x300C;I know. &#xA0;This is why I ordered Kim-kahngchul to acquire the Code. &#xA0;We have to bring him out too.&#x300D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Mmm. &#xA0;All right. &#xA0;We&#x2019;ll rescue the Recovery Code first.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x300C;Understood. &#xA0;When he acquires the Code, I&#x2019;ll notify you immediately.&#x300D;</span></p><p><span style="">They needed both the Earth&#x2019;s Code and the Recovery Code.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Where&#x2019;s Kim-kahngchul located at?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;He is at the Seoul Station.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Fortunately, they were located in the same sector.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Please ready another stretcher.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes, sir.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Another stretcher was taken out of Leone&#x2019;s ship. &#xA0;When the crew was ready, Captain Leone stepped forward first.</span></p><p><span style="">The road was desolate, and after walking for 10 minutes, a stairway heading below suddenly appeared. &#xA0;The stairs were damaged in places, and it looked pitiful. &#xA0;However, it was good enough to allow people to enter underground.</span></p><p><span style="">Before they entered the entrance, Captain Leone warned his crew members.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;The defense system will be neutralized for only 10 minutes. &#xA0;If we want to save both of them, we&#x2019;ll have to move quickly.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes, sir!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;We are ready to deactivate it, captain.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Captain Leone looked up, and he stared at the words engraved on the ceiling of the stairway.</span></p><p><span style="">It had been eroded away by time, but he was sure it said Seoul Station.</span></p><p><span style="">He had found the right place.</span></p><p><span style="">This was where Kahng-woojin&#x2019;s real body was jacked in. &#xA0;They just had to extract him after saving him.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Start it.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes, sir!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The crew members moved efficiently as they activated the device that will neutralize the Guardians.</span></p><p><span style="">***</span></p><p><span style="">The place with the most security guards and security measure inside the Flying Fortress was Sooah&#x2019;s room. &#xA0;In recent days, she hadn&#x2019;t been able to go out even if she wanted to. &#xA0;She wasn&#x2019;t a prisoner, but she lived the life of a prisoner. &#xA0;It was tortuous for Sooah.</span></p><p><span style="">However, Sooah had matured too much to express her feelings. &#xA0;She struggled to keep her feelings to herself.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Isn&#x2019;t this too suffocating for you, Sooah?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;No, mother.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">This was for Sooah&#x2019;s protection, but it wasn&#x2019;t as if she could live by herself. &#xA0;This was why Lee-soogyong stayed next to her daughter.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Why doesn&#x2019;t oppa come and visit me?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Huh? &#xA0;Maybe it is because oppa is busy?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">The flustered Lee-soogyong gave an answer. &#xA0;Kahng-woojin had been purposefully distancing himself from Sooah, and it seemed the little one had realized it.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hoo. &#xA0;I hope the war ends soon.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I wish so too.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;When is Jiwon-unni coming?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;She&#x2019;ll be here soon.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">This thread of conversation had been repeated a dozen times before by the mother and daughter. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">While they were having this exchange, a guest arrived.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Is it Jiwon?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Lee-soogyong opened the door in a welcoming fashion&#x2026;.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Excuse me.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">A stranger walked into the room.</span></p><p><span style="">He wasn&#x2019;t the usual employee, who cleaned and brought food everyday.</span></p><p><span style="">Moreover, this man didn&#x2019;t look anything like a security guard...</span></p><p><span style="">Lee-soogyong instinctively pushed Sooah behind her as she regarded the man.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Who are you?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The man let out an agreeable laugh as he scratched the back of his head.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ah. &#xA0;I&#x2019;m Kim-kahngchul.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;W...what do you want?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I&#x2019;m here to save the world.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Kim-kahngchul smiled as he stepped forward.</span></p>
