<p><span style="">Chapter 194 - Moon World (1)</span></p><p><span style="">The room was too spartan to be called a reception room. </span></p><p><span style="">There were no windows, and the room was thoroughly isolated from the outside. &#xA0;There were only two chairs present, and a man was sitting in one of the chair.</span></p><p><span style="">Ggee-ee-eek.</span></p><p><span style="">Kim-kahngchul saw the tightly shut door open up. &#xA0;When he saw Kahng-woojin enter, he stood up from his seat.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I&#x2019;ve been waiting for you.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin smirked at Kim-kahngchul&#x2019;s nonchalant words.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;You have big balls.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Kim-kahngchul had been barely able to escape after suffering a defeat, yet he had come here out of his own volition.</span></p><p><span style="">When Woojin sat in the chair, Kim-kahngchul also sat down.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What do you have to say to me?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin always went straight to the point. &#xA0;Usually, a person used levity and delay tactics to assess the intent of one&#x2019;s opponent. &#xA0;However, Woojin didn&#x2019;t even attempt to use such tactics.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I&#x2019;m hear to deliver a message.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Whose message? Toppler? Tell him to come here himself.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;He can&#x2019;t come here yet.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hmmm.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin folded his arms, and he leaned back into the back of his chair. &#xA0;It was funny, but the uncomfortable seat helped him organize his thoughts.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Why can&#x2019;t he come? Does he think he&#x2019;ll die?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Are you planning on killing him?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I don&#x2019;t like people, who approaches me, with some secret agenda in mind. &#xA0;This is true for you too.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin gave a non-subtle threat, but Kim-kahngchul&#x2019;s expression remained relaxed. &#xA0;&#xA0;No, it was as if he had fully accepted the consequences of this meeting. &#xA0;He was beyond worrying about his own death.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;This isn&#x2019;t my first time meeting you.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I know. &#xA0;We met last time.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;No. &#xA0;I&#x2019;m talking about meeting you in this place.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Woojin&#x2019;s eyebrows twitched.</span></p><p><span style="">Kim-kahngchul expressed his feeling of uneasiness in a frank manner, and the atmosphere took a turn for the worse.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I&#x2019;m not afraid of dying.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Everyone, who said such nonsense, ended up dying by my hands.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I&#x2019;m only afraid that I&#x2019;ll have to repeat this meeting again.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I want you to speak in terms that I can understand.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Woojin stood up from his seat.</span></p><p><span style="">As Woojin looked down from a higher vantage point, nervousness assaulted Kim-kahngchul.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Your actions are always the same. &#xA0;It is as they predicted.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;My patience is almost at an end.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin backed up his words by unfurling his hand.</span></p><p><span style="">Weeeeeng.</span></p><p><span style="">A ball of magical energy was in his hand. &#xA0;Kim-kahngchul glanced at it for a moment, but his gaze didn&#x2019;t falter.</span></p><p><span style="">If his role ended here, he didn&#x2019;t mind dying.</span></p><p><span style="">The only regret he had was not being able to see earth being saved.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;If my death is needed to save earth, I&#x2019;ll willingly give it up. &#xA0;However, I have words I must deliver to you.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Kim-kahngchul spoke quickly.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;You returned to earth later than the time decided by your destiny.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Was Kim-kahngchul talking about his return from Alphen to earth?</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;So what?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I&#x2019;m not sure why, but the appearance of Iello occurred earlier than expected.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style=""> &#x201C;Iello?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">He had heard of that name before.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Everything has been accelerated, so you haven&#x2019;t gained your full qualification yet. It is a shame.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin&#x2019;s expression crumpled.</span></p><p><span style="">He didn&#x2019;t like this.</span></p><p><span style="">It felt as if these people were playing above his head.</span></p><p><span style="">Fate, oracles, prophecies, and gods&#x2026;.</span></p><p><span style="">It was a gift set of everything he hated. &#xA0;He wanted to plug Kim-kahngchul&#x2019;s mouth shut.</span></p><p><span style="">What was fate?</span></p><p><span style="">He wasn&#x2019;t someone, who walked down a preordained road.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;When you are ready, Dr. Toppler will contact you. &#xA0;Only you can save the Moon World and Earth.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Why are those bastards so secretive about their identities?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">If they had the same goal as him, shouldn&#x2019;t they lay the cards on the table like Melody?</span></p><p><span style="">The Moon World was an unknown dimension to Woojin. &#xA0;Dr. Toppler had come from that place, and he was the first human encountered by Woojin with an unobservable soul.</span></p><p><span style="">When a person encounters something one doesn&#x2019;t understand, one feels fear and resistance.</span></p><p><span style="">If they truly wanted an alliance&#x2026;..</span></p><p><span style="">If they truly held the same goal as him, they should explain the situation in a way he could understand it.</span></p><p><span style="">Toppler should have come here instead of a messenger like Kim-kahngchul.</span></p><p><span style="">Weeeeeng</span></p><p><span style="">The ball of magical energy in Woojin&#x2019;s hand hardened. &#xA0;A single punch would obliterate Kim-kahngchul&#x2019;s head.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;This is the last message I was tasked to deliver to you.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">He licked his dried lips, and he accepted his approaching fate.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Have you ever asked yourself why you are able to level up?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Kim-kahngchul closed his eyes.</span></p><p><span style="">He had fulfilled his role.</span></p><p><span style="">He had believed in the prophecy as if it was scripture&#x2026;. &#xA0;He trusted the god-like beings. &#xA0;He had not hesitated in his efforts to save earth, and his role had now come to an end.</span></p><p><span style="">Weeeeeng.</span></p><p><span style="">The ball of magical energy dispersed.</span></p><p><span style="">Kim-kahngchul cracked open his closed eyes. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">He saw Kahng-woojin, who had a dumbfounded expression on his face.</span></p><p><span style="">It was as if he had been smacked in the back of his head.</span></p><p><span style="">Kim-kahngchul asked questions, but Kahng-woojin didn&#x2019;t respond at all.</span></p><p><span style="">He decided to wait this out.</span></p><p><span style="">A significant amount of time had passed.</span></p><p><span style="">Kahng-woojin&#x2019;s eyes were unfocused from the confusion, and his eyes was shaking.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Why did I never question this point?&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">It was unnatural.</span></p><p><span style="">No, it was unbelievable.</span></p><p><span style="">Leveling up&#x2026;.</span></p><p><span style="">This wasn&#x2019;t a game.</span></p><p><span style="">When a question formed in his mind, more questions cropped up in its wake.</span></p><p><span style="">Why was he summoned to Alphen? &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">What was the relationship between Alphen and Earth?</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Toppler&#x2026;. &#xA0;When can I meet him?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;He said he&#x2019;ll look for you when you are ready.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ready&#x2026;.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Was he talking about his level up? &#xA0;Or was he talking about the key called the Thrash&#x2019;s Executioner?</span></p><p><span style="">He had gained treasures within Alphen to make his defensive gear. &#xA0;What did he need to gain on earth to make the Executioner?</span></p><p><span style="">Earth and Alphen&#x2026;.</span></p><p><span style="">There was no end in sight for his worries, and his thoughts were clogged up inside his mind.</span></p><p><span style="">There was no way he could find the answer, and he was running out of time.</span></p><p><span style="">If he needed to choose one of two things, he would rather abstain from choosing, so he could have both.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;You should stay here and don&#x2019;t do anything.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">A new emotion sprouted on Kim-kahngchul&#x2019;s resigned face.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Why didn&#x2019;t you kill me?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Me? &#xA0;Why?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">The act of murder didn&#x2019;t always need a reason behind it to be carried out.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;If your information turns out to be rotten, I&#x2019;ll kill you at that time.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Did Kim-kahngchul think he killed someone on the basis of not liking someone?</span></p><p><span style="">If Kim-kahngchul &#xA0;didn&#x2019;t have impure intentions, there was no reason for enmity between them. &#xA0;He was only a messenger sent by the Moon World.</span></p><p><span style="">Koo-koong.</span></p><p><span style="">The closed door opened, and Kahng-woojin left the room. &#xA0;Kim-kahngchul stood up from his chair as if he had just seen a ghost.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;he has changed.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The last pages to his book of fate had come to an end, yet his story hadn&apos;t ended.</span></p><p><span style="">He had never planned for his life after this point in time.</span></p><p><span style="">Tears fell from his face.</span></p><p><span style="">He&#x2019;ll be able to see the savior, who&#x2019;ll open up the new world.</span></p><p><span style="">Jung-minchan, who had been waiting anxiously , asked Woojin a question.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What happened?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What do you mean?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">As if his head hurt, Kahng-woojin put pressure on his temple with his fingers.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Just leave Kim-kahngchul imprisoned.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;If he tries to escape, I believe he&#x2019;ll succeed. &#xA0;Are you sure?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Kim-kahngchul was a high rank Roused. &#xA0;If he wanted to secretly escape, how were they supposed to stop him?</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;If he wants to leave, he&#x2019;ll leave. &#xA0;If he wants to stay, he&#x2019;ll stay.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">He didn&#x2019;t care if Kim-kahngchul left or not.</span></p><p><span style="">At the very least, he&#x2019;ll be able to read the intention of the Moon World, who kept the truth hidden from him.</span></p><p><span style="">He didn&#x2019;t care if Kim-kahngchul stayed here as a hostage, or leave to advance his agenda.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;When will we arrive in Greece?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;We&#x2019;ll be there in three hours.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hmmm.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">He was a spitting distance from level 99.</span></p><p><span style="">Should he continue to hunt? Or should he earn Points, so he could gain his two remaining pieces of the Thrash&#x2019;s set?</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I&#x2019;ll do both.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Tell Jaemin to come to me. &#xA0;Then you go do what you have to do.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">After giving his instruction, Woojin ascended towards the deck. &#xA0;Jung-minchan kept following behind him.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I told you to go do your work.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;It is my job to help the president.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Basically, you don&#x2019;t have any work to do.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">He was the Prime Minister. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">How busy could he be?</span></p><p><span style="">The flying fortress traveled towards sites where large Dungeon Breaks had occurred. &#xA0;However, Bibi was in charge of the battles.</span></p><p><span style="">His job was basically changing the schedule when he received requests for help from various countries.</span></p><p><span style="">However, even this was being done by his subordinates.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Your job is cushy. &#xA0;Anyways, I saw some people with very dark souls. &#xA0;You should crackdown on your employees.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">While Woojin walked back and forth on the ship, he had crossed path with employees with souls so dirty that a bad stench emanated from them.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;It seems &#xA0;you were too loose in how you picked the employees.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;I&#x2019;ll immediately investigate this problem.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Jung-minchan answered with a serious expression on his face. &#xA0;Aside from the Roused, he had hand-picked all the regular employees. &#xA0;He had looked carefully at the 1,000 employees he had hired, but it seemed he hadn&#x2019;t been able to filter out all the bad apples.</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin left behind Minhcan, who quickly headed towards his office. &#xA0;He went to the corner of the deck. &#xA0;He approached Yong Yong, who was taking up the entire Wyvern&#x2019;s nest by itself.</span></p><p><span style="">[What is your wish?]</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin smirked as he summoned Dolsae and Bibi.</span></p><p><span style="">Pah-paht.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ah-aht. &#xA0;Master.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Bibi, who had been playing inside the control room, was abruptly summoned in front of Woojin.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Bibi. &#xA0;I have some other work to do. &#xA0;I want you to work with Dolsae and Yong Yong to kill all the Dimensional lords.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Oh ho. &#xA0;Please leave it to me.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Afterwards, he summoned his Death Knights and Jaenis.</span></p><p><span style="">Shwahhhhk.</span></p><p><span style="">An overwhelming sense of danger was felt when they were summoned. &#xA0;They looked at Woojin with trust in their eyes.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I want you all to kill every enemy you see.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">[As the lord commands&#x2026;.]</span></p><p><span style="">Their hunt would increase his EXP.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Were you looking for me, hyung?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Do-jaemin appeared right on time. &#xA0;When Jaemin arrived, Woojin took him towards the Portal.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;You&#x2019;ll be coming with me.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Are we going to Alphen? &#xA0;Are we going to go pick up team leader Haesol and Sunggoo hyung?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;They aren&#x2019;t children. &#xA0;They&#x2019;ll come when they are ready.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;So where are we going?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;We are going to increase our Point total&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Jaemin, who was full of question, was taken to the Dimensional Domain of Alandal.</span></p><p><span style="">[My lord&#x2026;.]</span></p><p><span style="">Kiba, who had been guarding the owner-less castle, kneeled in front of him.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Mmm. &#xA0;I really will take you to a battlefield next time.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">[I&#x2019;ll be waiting for your order.]</span></p><p><span style="">He would have to rotate Kiba out with someone else. &#xA0;The Death Knights were causing havoc to their heart&#x2019;s content outside. &#xA0;Kiba only had the chance to fight occasional Adventurers, who arrived to this Dimensional Domain through the Dungeon.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Jaemin.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes, hyung.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I need Points.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Mmm&#x2026;. What can I do to help?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;We are going for an endless run of Dimensional Battles.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">At Woojin&#x2019;s words, Jaemin grinned.</span></p><p><span style="">He had inherited the Count&#x2019;s Blood to become a Vampire Lord.</span></p><p><span style="">He had escaped the curse of the sun, and he now had the ability to be able to control his thirst.</span></p><p><span style="">He was basically a human if one took away his strength, reflex, sight&#x2026;.</span></p><p><span style="">It had been a while, since he had far outstripped a human in terms of overall ability.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Please leave it to me.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">He&#x2019;ll be able to show off his enhanced capabilities through this.</span></p><p><span style="">Do-jaemin sat in the Tactician&#x2019;s chair.</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin didn&#x2019;t even bother to sit in his Throne to look for his opponents. &#xA0;He just chose a random opponent.</span></p><p><span style="">He didn&#x2019;t care if they accepted or not. &#xA0;He&#x2019;ll plunder all the Dimensional lords.</span></p><p><span style="">He needed a massive amount of Points to be able to craft the remaining two Thrash&#x2019;s set Item.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x3008;You have requested a Dimensional Battle with Liah-nim.&#x3009; </span></p><p><span style="">He had picked a random opponent, yet when he saw the name, Woojin let out a smirk.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;It&#x2019;s her again.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin&#x2019;s war against the Dimensions had just started.</span></p><p><span style="">Ggee-ah-ahng, ggahng.</span></p><p><span style="">The sound of steel clanging against each other was loud, and the sound rang out into the surrounding.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;This is your ration, Toppler-nim.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Toppler stopped hammering out the crumpled steel plate. &#xA0;He smiled at the child, who had come to him with a small basket.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Thank you, Soh Soh.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The little girl named Soh Soh gave a bow in farewell, and she quickly walked away with her basket.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Whew.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">He let out a sigh after he pulled himself away from his intense labor. &#xA0;When he opened what was brought to him, &#xA0;he saw a canteen with water, and a bowl with some unknown gruel.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Mmmm.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">He ate gruel that tasted like nothing. &#xA0;It dribbled down his throat, since there was nothing to chew within it. &#xA0;&#xA0;His simple meal didn&#x2019;t take too long to finish, but he was still thankful for the food.</span></p><p><span style="">Toppler drank all the water he was given, and he turned his gaze towards the window. &#xA0;He looked out at the black sky.</span></p><p><span style="">Anticipation and worry filled his eyes as he looked at the twinkling stars.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ho-ooh. &#xA0;This time we have to&#x2026;.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">This place had already reached its limit.</span></p><p><span style="">If another Reset occurs, the Moon World might no longer have a future.</span></p><p><span style="">All they keys were in that man&#x2019;s hands.</span></p>
