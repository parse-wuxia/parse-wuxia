Thank you and enjoy~)</span></span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ah, I&#x2019;m tired.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">He had driven back from Daegoo. He also had to drive Do-jiwon to Sahdahng, and it had tired him out.</span></p><p><span style="">Moreover, he had been really nervous about the passenger next to him.</span></p><p><span style="">She was none other than Kahng-woojin&#x2019;s woman.</span></p><p><span style="">Even Woo-soonghoon, who had a lot of experience dealing with pretty women, had never seen such a beautiful woman. He was in a constant state of nervousness as he shared the same space within the car.</span></p><p><span style="">Woo-soonghoon massaged his sore shoulders. He took a shower then he opened a can of beer as he sat on his sofa.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ha-ah. Is there anything fun on tv?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">As he was flipping through the tv channel, he stopped when he saw the press conference held by Alandal and the Hwarang guild. Since it was his guild, it caught his eyes.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ha. They are trying to bite him like dogs.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Soonghoon saw the reporters ask a torrent of questions, and Woojin looked at the reporters indifferently. It made him feel a weird sense of incongruity.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;His temper is really dirty&#x2026;&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Even kings were cussed at when they weren&#x2019;t present. Soonghoon knew better than anyone that Woojin had a really bad temper.</span></p><p><span style="">He had set up the events to be considerate of Woojin. Woojin hadn&#x2019;t even thanked him. Instead, Soonghoon was given punishments&#x2026;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;At this rate, isn&#x2019;t he going to flip out?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">He was worried, but Soonghoon doubted Woojin would act that way in front of the camera. He had a bad temper, but he couldn&#x2019;t be that ignorant.</span></p><p><span style="">Soonghoon was drinking a single gulp of his beer, when Woojin stood up from his seat inside the screen. He became nervous in spite of himself.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;He&#x2026;he&#x2019;s going to make an accident. He&#x2019;s like a crazy wild horse.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">When he saw Woojin&#x2019;s expression, he knew Woojin was in a really bad mood. Soonghoon was an experienced salesman with 8 years of experience, so he was quick to pick up such tells. With just one glance, he could understand what the other person was thinking.</span></p><p><span style="">Sure enough, Woojin kicked the president of the Hwarang, who had been tormented by grief.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Waaah. Fucking awesome.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Before he knew it, Woo-soonghoon yelled.</span></p><p><span style="">He knew his president was a crazy bastard, but he didn&#x2019;t realize the president would show his crazy side to the public.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Wahh. Fuck. It&#x2019;s like the time when I was almost beaten.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">His chest turned cold even when he thought about the it right now. He had sold a mere Galaxy to such a person. His cheeks still throbbed when he thought about that incident. Sweat ran down his back as he saw Woojin kick Lee-sahngho, who was trying to get up, again, . It automatically made Soonghoon feel some empathy towards Lee-sahngho.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Wahh. Wah-ah&#x2026; Wahh..&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">He was too surprised and shocked. He couldn&#x2019;t think of anything to say.</span></p><p><span style="">Wahhh.</span></p><p><span style="">A human can act like that. A person can live without not giving a fuck about what other people think.</span></p><p><span style="">He was someone who lived by his temper.</span></p><p><span style="">[Hweeek, Zzwahhk!]</span></p><p><span style="">The camera audio picked up the sound. Soonghoon&#x2019;s body flinched when he heard the graphic slapping sound. He couldn&#x2019;t look away from the TV. Will Woojin make a bigger accident?</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;M&#x2026;maybe this is already a big accident?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Korea&#x2019;s 3 great guild.</span></p><p><span style="">He was the guild master of Hwarang.</span></p><p><span style="">The Hwarang guild&#x2019;s president was being held by the back of his neck, and he was being slapped. He was well aware of Woojin&#x2019;s personality, so it probably won&#x2019;t stop at one blow&#x2026;</span></p><p><span style="">[The wild gazelle meets a female as he attempts to mate. The female gazelle&#x2026;.]</span></p><p><span style="">The tv screen changed into two gazelles trying to mate, and a calm older voice accompanied it. Soonghoon blinked his eyes.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What..what the hell?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The urgent news had interrupted a drama, and now the programming changed into an animal documentary.</span></p><p><span style="">As expected, president&#x2026;.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I bet everyone is in an uproar right now.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Wouldn&#x2019;t this be a hot issue maker?(TLN:trending story) Soonghoon took out his hand phone. When he opened the webpage, it was as expected. The real time search ranking was dominated by Kahng-woojin.</span></p><p></p><ol><p></p><p></p><li><span style=""> Kahng-woojin Assault</span></li><p></p><p></p><li><span style=""> Press Conference</span></li><p></p><p></p><li><span style=""> Slap of Anger</span></li><p></p><p></p></ol><p></p><p><span style="">New.

What is this?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Woo-soonghoon clicked on the Holy Maiden link. The search result expanded, then he clicked on the first video.</span></p><p><span style="">BBS station&#x2019;s anchor was speaking, but he was speaking English. Soonghoon couldn&#x2019;t understand what was being said. Soon the video resolved into a very beautiful blonde woman stepping forward.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Huh. It&#x2019;s an elf. An elf.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">He had thought Do-jiwon was pretty, but this was&#x2026; It was a beauty that made one doubt if it was real or not. It felt like he was seeing a CG. He felt a sense of dissonance.</span></p><p><span style="">The more surprising thing was the people in front of her.</span></p><p><span style="">The elf woman made some kind of prayer towards the person in the wheelchair. Light swirled around the patient in the wheel chair, then the patient suddenly stood up.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;W&#x2026;what the hell?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">That wasn&#x2019;t the only surprising thing. A man missing an arm stood in front of the elf woman. She prayed once more. The light swirled around the man, and his arm was regenerated.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;T&#x2026;this is crazy. Isn&#x2019;t this fake?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">There were a lot of opportunist Roused out there. They tried to sell medicine that was considered to be miraculous. Even the Regeneration Salve could regenerate a missing part of a body.</span></p><p><span style="">However, there weren&#x2019;t any medicine or ability that could fix a congenital deformity.</span></p><p><span style="">Even if the medicine existed, it was incredibly expensive. They were items one couldn&#x2019;t attain even if one had a lot of money.</span></p><p><span style="">This woman had the ability execute a miracle.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Jeez.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The search ranking that was plastered with Kahng-wooin was replaced by the search words like Holy Maiden, Melody BBS, Miraculous Regeneration and Titan guild.</span></p><p><span style="">The Miracle Maker. Holy Maiden Melody.</span></p><p><span style="">Her appearance in the US shook the whole world.</span></p><p><span style="">*</span></p><p><span style="">Treatment beyond medical science.</span></p><p><span style="">The treatment of incurable diseases caused massive waves across the world.</span></p><p><span style="">Mrs. Hamilton had a congenital deformity that had prevented her from using her legs. The healing of this famous patient was only the beginning.</span></p><p><span style="">She had healed a man who had lost an arm 20 years ago during a war. She allowed a patient who had never walked before to stand on his two feet.</span></p><p><span style="">The miracles were surprising, and a big crowd gathered at the Titan guild to wish for a miracle. There were numerous people from various nationality and class gathered there. However, they all weren&#x2019;t able to experience the miracle.</span></p><p><span style="">It was only for those who believed.</span></p><p><span style="">It was for those who wanted to become the servants of Aria.</span></p><p><span style="">While the Holy Maiden Melody from the church of Aria displayed her miracles, she revealed the existence of the goddess Aria to Earth.</span></p><p><span style="">As the number of believers increased, voluntary offerings started to be given.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;It&#x2019;s pointless to stop her now.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The Titan guild master Deacon searched for Melody, so he could meet her. An entire floor of the Titan guild&#x2019;s head quarter was assigned to Melody and her followers.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;President. Are you really going to agree to her request?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Look over there..&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Ath his secretary&#x2019;s words, Deacon pointed towards all the people worshipping the goddess Aria. Many people had converted to the church of Aria. The first step to receiving the Holy Maiden&#x2019;s miracle was to convert.</span></p><p><span style="">She was only able to exhibit her powers to those who believed in her goddess.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;She already has followers&#x2026; It doesn&#x2019;t matter if we like it or not. Our guild has to agree to the request if we want to continue our relationship.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The secretary agreed with Deacon&#x2019;s resigned words, so he shut his mouth.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;We need her precognition ability.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">He was right. Her foresight allowed the Titan to possess five 5 star Dungeons, and two 6 star Dungeons in just one week.</span></p><p><span style="">Moreover, she had requested only one thing.</span></p><p><span style="">Aria&#x2019;s Holy Knight Order.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Isn&#x2019;t there already a lot of volunteers?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;That is why I am worried, master.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">He understood why the secretary was worried. Within the Titan guild, there was a significant number of Roused who had joined in worshiping the goddess Aria. There were those who had been surprised by her miracle, and many of their family had received benefits from her.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;We have no choice. Since we can&#x2019;t stop it, we have to make the best use of her.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;&#x2026;.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Deacon spoke in a sour manner. He felt bitter inside since it felt like his leadership role had been passed on to her. He had no choice, but to minimize the damage. He had to look for a way to gain something out of this.</span></p><p><span style="">Anyways, she was the greatest Roused in existence right now.</span></p><p><span style="">She had the ability of an SS Rank.</span></p><p><span style="">*</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Lee-hyunhwee tried to kill me. Don&#x2019;t ask me why I killed her. Ask this bastard who is trying to assassinate me from behind the scenes.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Kahng-woojin voice thundered towards the reporters, then he left the press conference. The reporters were busy with activity, and Lee-sahngho was lying idle on the floor.</span></p><p><span style="">No one asked any questions, and no one spoke.</span></p><p><span style="">Silence.</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin left after he threw a grenade. After receiving the grenade, Lee-sahngho, who was lying still on the floor, suddenly got up. His face was swollen, and he looked ridiculous.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Fuck.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">His brutish behavior didn&#x2019;t have a limit. He would have never guess Woojin was this stubborn.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;President. What do you think happened?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What do you think! He probably made that shit up!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Lee-sahngho gave an angry reply as he left the press conference room. Shit. There was a limit to how embarrassed he could be. Lee-sahngho asked a question towards the Hwarang guild members following him.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Kooh-ook. Twehh.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">He dirtied the clean hotel hall by spitting a loogey mixed with blood. The inside of his mouth was numb, and he couldn&#x2019;t feel anything. His vision was fuzzy. It seemed a blood vessel had burst in his eye.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Fuck. How many times did he hit me?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">It was ridiculous. Lee-sahngho had fainted mid-way. He was a Rank B Physical type Roused yet he had fainted from being slapped.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;He hit you s&#x2026;seven times..&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Son of a bitch.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Lee-sahngho let out a string of cuss words. Brute asshole. Crazy bitch. Even if he attributed all the cuss words to Woojin, it wasn&#x2019;t enough.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ready my car. Gather all the lawyers at the headquarters.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes, president.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Lee-sahngho used the back door of the hotel to slip out quietly.</span></p><p><span style="">*</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;You were too harsh.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;&#x2026;.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;It is a massive incident now. The public sentiments will be up in arms against you.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">At Jung-michan&#x2019;s words, Woojin stopped walking. Woojin looked straight at Jung-minchan.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hey, Minchan.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes, president.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">He didn&#x2019;t think of Woojin as someone younger than him. Kahng-woojin looked larger than life to Jung-minchan.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Those bastards were trying corner me. They were trying to paint me as a murderer.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;But it isn&#x2019;t the truth, right?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;It&#x2019;s the truth.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;&#x2026;!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Jung-minchan was so surprised that he could only blink his eyes. Haemin and Sungoo had been trailing behind. Even their faces froze.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;She tried to kill me, so I killed her. I was stronger. Is that going to be a problem?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;&#x2026;.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Of course, it&#x2019;ll be a problem. How could it not be? Still, Minchan didn&#x2019;t know how he should answer that question. If someone tried to kill him, wouldn&#x2019;t it be more strange to let the person kill him?</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Do you know what the schemers ,who plot in the background, fear the most?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;&#x2026;.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;It is making a big mess out in the open. In public.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;&#x2026;.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;It&#x2019;ll cause a big problem for that person. He won&#x2019;t be able to easily conspire from behind the scene.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Jung-minchan was about to give a retort to Kahng-woojin&#x2019;s words, but he stopped himself from speaking.</span></p><p><span style="">What would be the result of this?</span></p><p><span style="">The narrative would change from &#x2018;Why couldn&#x2019;t Kahng-woojin prevent Lee-yunhwee&#x2019;s death?&#x2019; to &#x2018;Was Hwarang really behind the assassination attempt of Kahng-woojin?&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">There weren&#x2019;t any evidence. It was something that had happened within the Dungeon.</span></p><p><span style="">He thought Woojin had acted without thinking through the ramification, but it seemed Woojin had made some plans of his own. Jung-minchan&#x2019;s face was filled with admiration as he looked at Woojin.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Indeed, you are the president. So how are you planning to pick up the pieces?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Why would I do that?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Kahng-woojin shrugged his shoulder.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;That&#x2019;s your job.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;&#x2026;.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">He acted without a plan! This asshole of a president.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;If you think your salary is insufficient, then increase it..&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">It seemed Woojin still had a conscience.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Kmmmm. I&#x2019;m going to go to the Dungeon, so you pick up the pieces. Let&#x2019;s see Director Jung&#x2019;s skills. Let&#x2019;s go Sunggoo.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes, hyung-nim.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin was basically doing a hit and run after a major accident.</span></p><p><span style="">Kim-haemin put his hand on the devastated Jung-minchan&#x2019;s shoulder. An indescribable sense of kinship was formed, and their wet eyes met.</span></p><p><span style="">Kahng-wooin and Sungoo exited the hotel, but they weren&#x2019;t able to go straight to the Dungeon.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Wahh. It&#x2019;s Kahng-woojin!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The road in front of the hotel was filled with people.</span></p><p><span style="">One could see such a large crowd at a fan signing event for a famous celebrity.</span></p><p><span style="">The reporters who weren&#x2019;t invited to the press conference was busily pressing the shutters to their cameras.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What the hell.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Why is there so many people gathered here in the middle of the night? When Kahng-woojin took a step, the people made way for him. He was such an amazing Roused that the people watched from the surrounding as they didn&#x2019;t dare to approach him.</span></p><p><span style="">Their eyes were filled with a mixture of thankfulness, happiness, and novelty.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Thank you. I am very thankful that you protected our house. From this day on, I&#x2019;ll always cheer for you no matter what.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Oppa. You are so cool. Thank you.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I lived in this neighborhood for 70 years. Thank you very much. Thank you.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hook hook. Thank you. Thank you very much.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">There were old people, newly married couples, students in uniform, and even stern faced older men.</span></p><p><span style="">6 star Dungeon Break.</span></p><p><span style="">The residents had given up on their neighborhood, and they had to evacuate. Now they were all here to express their thanks to Kahng-woojin. They hadn&#x2019;t gathered here to see a celebrity.</span></p><p><span style="">They came to see their benefactor, who had protected their home.</span></p><p><span style="">Kahng-woojin grinned.</span></p><p><span style="">He had been able to level up by monopolizing the EXP to himself. Moreover, he had protected these people&#x2019;s home.</span></p><p><span style="">Every step Kahng-woojin took the crowd parted to make way for him. Hong-sunggoo, who was following Woojin, was choked up with emotion. His chest automatically puffed out in pride.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ahjushi. Thank you very much.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">A small child ran out from middle of the crowd, and she pushed out a bouquet of flower towards Woojin. Kahng-woojin stopped for a moment, and his eyes met the child&#x2019;s eyes. The child&#x2019;s eyes were laughing.</span></p><p><span style="">It was a crystal clear smile.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Well, this is&#x2026;.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">Kahng-woojin received the bouquet of flower. He lifted the child with his other arm as he raised the bouquet of flower into the air.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Not too bad.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">The people cheered at Kahng-woojin&#x2019;s action.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Wahhhhhh!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hurray for Kahng-woojin!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Jung-minchan came out when he head the loud noise made by the people, and he shook his head. Maybe picking up the pieces of this incident might be much easier than he had thought.</span></p><p><span style="">The Alandal leader might be a Janus&#x2026; (TLN: Roman god Janus, he has two faces)</span></p><p><span style="">Minchan and Haemin looked on as the Alandal&#x2019;s president headed towards the Dungeon while receiving cheers from the crowd.</span></p><p><span style="">Kahn-woojin was a hero, who had saved this city.</span></p><p></p></div><p></p>
