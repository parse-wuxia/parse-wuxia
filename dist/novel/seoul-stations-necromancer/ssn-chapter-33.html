Thanks and enjoy~)</span></span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ooh ooh.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Jiwon&#x2019;s head felt like it was about to split open. She got up as she moaned. When she looked around her surrounding, she was at Jaemin&#x2019;s house. Bits and pieces of her memories started to piece itself together.</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin&#x2019;s dongsaeng named Sunggoo took the lead, and he started a crazy storm of games. It caused her to frantically drink alcohol. Sunggoo had wished in vain for her to take off her hat, and he was persistent in getting her to drink.</span></p><p><span style="">Then everything became too dizzy, so she leaned forward on the table, and her hat had fallen off.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;They saw everything&#x2026;.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">She wanted to hide it. She met someone who only remembered her beautiful old self. However, she had shown all of her embarrassing personal matter now.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;I don&#x2019;t get why it&#x2019;s such a big deal. She&#x2019;s still pretty.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">When her hat fell off, she didn&#x2019;t have the courage to get up. So she pretended to have fallen asleep. However, she did drink too much alcohol, so her memory was fuzzy&#x2026;</span></p><p><span style="">She thought Woojin had carried her over here&#x2026; Then her film of memory was cut for real, and she couldn&#x2019;t remember anything aftwerards.</span></p><p><span style="">Jiwon put her hands over her reddened cheeks, then she realized she still had her hat on. She tried to take it off.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ouch.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Jiwon slowly pulled against her hat and several strands of her hair was pulled along with it.</span></p><p><span style="">Zzeeeee.</span></p><p><span style="">On both side of the hat, several strands of hair came off with the scotch tapes. When she saw this, Jiwon could&#x2019;t help but laugh.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Jeez.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">She couldn&#x2019;t remember when he stuck it on her, but it strangely made her heart flutter. How could a scotch tape shake a person&#x2019;s heart like this?</span></p><p><span style="">This was the first time.</span></p><p><span style="">This person called her pretty even though she had changed into a monster. She had assumed no one would think such thoughts about her unless the person was crazy. However, Woojin had appeared in front of Jiwon.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ooh ooh.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Her heart fluttered, and she was hungover. After quenching her thirst with water, she tried to go into the restroom, but the door was locked.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Uh, uh? Noonah is awake? Wait a moment.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Why are you awake so early in the morning?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Uh uh? While I was sleeping, I realized I didn&#x2019;t do the l&#x2026;laundry. I didn&#x2019;t want noonah to work too hard on my behalf.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What the heck. At least leave the door open.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Uh uh? W&#x2026;wait a moment. I&#x2019;m almost done.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">It was 5 in the morning.</span></p><p><span style="">The door to the restroom didn&#x2019;t open for a long time.</span></p><p><span style="">*</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Nyahhh.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin woke up from his sleep, and the first thing that greeted him was Bibi.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Did you sleep well-ahong?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Whew. What were those things chasing after me?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;It&#x2019;s Pororo&#x2019;s friend-aohng. I saw it on the television-ahong.&#x201D; (TLN: It&#x2019;s a real tv show. If you are curious, google this. &#x201C;??? ???&#x201D;)</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Whew.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">It was a long dream.</span></p><p><span style="">They chased after him with a bright smile&#x2026; He could still hear the laugh of the animal friends circling around his ears.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Bring me my hand phone.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Understood-aohng.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Bibi brought the hand phone with her mouth. He opened the phone then he composed a text message.</span></p><p><span style="">[Hammer Hotel Room 1703. If you come later than 9 o&#x2019;clock then I&#x2019;m going to beat you up.]</span></p><p><span style="">It was 8 o&#x2019;clock right now. One hour was plenty of time for him to come here. Woojin&#x2019;s body was soaked with sweat. He got up from the bed to wash his body.</span></p><p><span style="">Shwaaaahhh.</span></p><p><span style="">He finished showering, and when he came out, Bibi was looking at a brochure.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What are you looking at?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;It&#x2019;s the Room service guide-ahong. I want to eat this-nyahng.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Room service?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin looked at the guide, then he picked up the hotel&#x2019;s phone.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I guess they deliver food.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Soon after Woojin ordered the room service, the food picked out by Bibi showed up. It was spread out as if he was at a restaurant. Woojin was astonished by the food.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Earth stacks up well against Alphen.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">He thought the nobles of Alphen lived in extreme luxury. However, if one had money, one could live in comparable luxury on earth.</span></p><p><span style="">No. Woojin hadn&#x2019;t experienced being in the upper class on earth yet, so it might be more luxurious over here.</span></p><p><span style="">When the plates of food were spread out, Bibi quickly jumped on top of the dining table then she picked up a fork.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Nyahng. I wanted to eat this-ahong.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Bibi picked up a Tonkatsu, which didn&#x2019;t exist on Alphen.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Nyahng. They fried the pig. The cooking methods of the Earthlings is fascinating-aohng.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Even if it isn&#x2019;t pork, they fry everything.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Is that true-nyahong?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Alphen&#x2019;s cuisine didn&#x2019;t have any fried foods. Bibi started talking about various foods she saw on tv, and how she was going to eat all of them next time.</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin realized something, while he was looking at her.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ah. I should also watch some tv.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">It was the 20 year gap in his consciousness. He was gone for only 5 years, but Woojin had returned to earth after 20 years. It wouldn&#x2019;t be strange if he claimed the earth in his memory and the current earth were basically different worlds to him.</span></p><p><span style="">Excluding the time he spent in the Dungeon, Woojin decided to dedicate all of his time on watching tv. He&#x2019;ll be able to enjoy the popular culture, and it will allow him to quickly adjust to society.</span></p><p><span style="">In the midst of the meal, the bell rang.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Bibi. Go back into the Summoning room.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Nyahng. I haven&#x2019;t had my fill yet-nyahng..&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I&#x2019;ll buy you more later.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;All right-ahong. You most definitely have to buy it for me-nyahng..&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Bibi turned into black smoke, and she suddenly disappeared. Woojin packed his belongings, then he opened the door.</span></p><p><span style="">Sunggoo was waiting on his knees in front of the door. When Woojin came out, he prostrated himself on the floor.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I&#x2019;m sorry. I lost my mind after I became drunk yesterday. Please forgive me, hyung-nim.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;It&#x2019;s all right. Were you able to make an appointment for a 4 star Dungeon?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">If he thought about the money he made per hour then quickly clearing the 3 star Dungeons was the way to go. However, the experience he earned was low.</span></p><p><span style="">If his goal was to level up, then it would be better if he attacked a 3 star Dungeon. The money he lacked in purchasing his house could all be earned before he moved.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I&#x2019;ll find it soon.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Let&#x2019;s go down and have a cup of cofee.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin and Sunggoo went down to the coffee shop provided by the hotel on the 1st floor. They made their orders, then they sat down in the chairs.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;The coffee price here is really expensive.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;This is a hotel&#x2026;. Hotels are originally expensive.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Chet. Anyways, hurry up and find it. Since you are making an appointment, why don&#x2019;t you just book us for everything available this week.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes, sir.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin was a bit different from the others. If one was a normal Roused, 4 star Dungeons were more profitable than the 3 star Dungeons.</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin had a monstrous clear time, so he was able to finish a 3 star Dungeon in a blink. He could make more profit per hour in a 3 star Dungeon.</span></p><p><span style="">However, if he became familiar with the 4 star Dungeons, then he could probably decrease the clear time. It would allow him to make more money per hour.</span></p><p><span style="">The 4 star Dungeons were very large and there were too many variables. The 4 star Dungeons were dangerous, so the Roused teams attempted it carefully. Still, there weren&#x2019;t that many 4 star Dungeons in existence, so there weren&#x2019;t many open spots.</span></p><p><span style="">While Sunggoo was busyily searching for a Dungeon, Woojin focused on the game on his hand phone.</span></p><p><span style="">Pew pew, Pahng-yah!</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Look who it is?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin heard a pleasant voice, and the voice wasn&#x2019;t welcomed by him. Woojin turned his head to see a smiling Jung-minchan.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Jeez. You show up like a ghost.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Haha. Before I go to work, I always drink a cup of coffee here.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">He was lying. Hammer hotel was managed by the Hammer guild. He had known since yesterday that Woojin had checked into this hotel.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ahjuhshi. This is another coincidence?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hahahaha. I guess so. Maybe we are fated to meet each other?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin shrugged his shoulder when he heard the sly words. Then he pointed towards a seat.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;If you are here then why don&#x2019;t you have a seat?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Should I?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">When Jung-minchan took a seat, Woojin asked him a question.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;If you have some business with me then be quick about it.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Haha. What business would I have with you? I&#x2019;m sorry about what happened yesterday. If you need anything, just say the word. I&#x2019;ll give you anything as an apology.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin grinned. Why was this man so passionate about bringing him into the same guild as him? What did he gain by it?</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Is Mr. Sunggoo perhaps making a appointment for a Dungeon?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What? Yes. I&#x2019;m trying to find an empty spot in the schedule for a 4 star Dungeon, but there aren&#x2019;t&#x2026;&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Dungeon Forum has a number of uses, but it isn&#x2019;t specialized. Please wait a moment.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Minchan took out a notebook he brought on the table. He ran a program, and all the appointments to the high ranked Dungeons was projected on the screen.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hul.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Sunggoo was surprised, but Woojin wasn&#x2019;t interested. He didn&#x2019;t care if a good computer program or his underling was used to make an appointment. If he was able to make an appointment, then either method sufficed.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;The Guild Support Division is specialized to deal with such problems. Moreover, if a Roused like Woojin joins our guild, you will get free housing. Ah. If you prefer the hotel, then you could use this place indefinitely. A lot of Roused already use this place as their lodging.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin glanced at Minchan.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;That does sound good.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hahaha. Are you a little bit interested now? Look over here. This is the list of the empty slots for the 4 star Dungeons.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Four slots of 11 am, 2 pm, 5 pm and 10 pm was empty. The Appointment fee, and Usage fee was all listed on the side. The program was most definitely better than the Dungeon Forum.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;So what should I do? Should I make you an appointment? If you were in a guild, then you wouldn&#x2019;t have to worry about such cumbersome procedures.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">It really seemed he would be more comfortable if he had a guild. Woojin asked a question.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;If I take down your guild leader then will I become the guild master??&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;No way.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Then I&#x2019;m not interested.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;&#x2026;.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Jung-minchan couldn&#x2019;t speak for a long time after he heard such absurd words.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;I knew it. I guess he wants a high position?&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">Minchan thought his prediction had been correct. Woojin was in the midst of negotiating with him. He acted uninterested, but he kept leaving hints.</span></p><p><span style="">The fact that he checked into the Hammer hotel was a signal being sent to Minchan. It was a signal saying I am staying here, so come find me.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;I have nothing that could reel this guy in. However, I have to catch a Roused of this caliber no matter what.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">It would be best to accede to whatever he wanted. Adding Woojin to the guild would be a gain for the guild. Without the president&#x2019;s approval, it would be hard to give him the vice president seat. However, if Woojin was able to get the position of team leader for a Roused team, then would he accept Minchan&#x2019;s offer?</span></p><p><span style="">Minchan&#x2019;s mind raced as Woojin pointed to the very top Dungeon listed on the screen.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Will I be able to make appointments with this?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Of course.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Is it ok to help people who aren&#x2019;t in your guild?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;This is a favor. A favor.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">When Minchan laughed, Woojin also laughed after him.</span></p><p><span style="">*</span></p><p><span style="">It was too elaborate for this meeting to have been a coincidence. Kim-haemin was ready outside the hotel with his car.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Well, let&#x2019;s go.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;My car is in the parking lot.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Don&#x2019;t worry about it. When you finish clearing the Dungeon, I&#x2019;ll bring you back here. Ah. Of course, this is a benefit provided to the Roused who join our guild.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">As they listened to Minchan&#x2019;s guild promotion, Woojin and Sunggoo got into the car. Haemin drove two station down from the Sahdahng station. They headed towards the Seoul National University Station.</span></p><p><span style="">It was within walking distance.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I&#x2019;ve finished making an appointment. There is a little bit of time left before you can use the Dungeon. Why don&#x2019;t we come back after having some tea?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">There was 1 hour left until the appointed 11 o&#x2019;clock time. This was a great opportunity for Minchan.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;The descriptions of the Seoul National University Station&#x2019;s 2nd entrance is in the guide. However, would you give me some time to brief you on this Dungeon?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Seoul National University Station&#x2019;s 2nd entrance wasn&#x2019;t owned by the Hammer guild. However, the information about the high rank Dungeons were traded between guilds. This was why Minchan knew all the details about this Dungeon.</span></p><p><span style="">It was important to have a briefing before attacking a Dungeon. If one paid attention and acted on the information, the Dungeon attack becomed much easier.</span></p><p><span style="">Knowledge was power! If one enters a guild, then one could clear a Dungeon comfortably! Minchan wanted Woojin to know this.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ah. That&#x2019;ll be great.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">As Minchan&#x2019;s face brightened at Woojin&#x2019;s assent, a bright light was emitted by the 6th exit across the intersection.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Uh? It&#x2019;s a Dungeon Reset.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">He had seen it on film, but this was the first time Sunggoo had seen it in person. He spoke out in surprise.</span></p><p><span style="">There was only one reason why the Dungeon would glow.</span></p><p><span style="">Dungeon Reset.</span></p><p><span style="">The Mine&#x2019;s life span had come to an end, and it had turned into a new Dungeon. If the Dungeon couldn&#x2019;t be cleared in 30 days, then a Dungeon Break would happen.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;J..jeez. Hurry up and contact the guild, Haemin.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes, sir.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Kim-haemin busily made a call. Woojin&#x2019;s gaze rested on the location across the intersection as he spoke.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;So a free Dungeon formed over there?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Dungeon Reset. The first one to clear the Dungeon went missing, so the Dungeon basically became owner-less.</span></p><p><span style="">However, a Dungeon wasn&#x2019;t like picking up a coin off the floor. It would be reckless to attempt it&#x2026;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin&#x2019;s two eyes became fully alert when he saw the people busily moving around the 6th exit.</span></p><p></p></div><p></p>
