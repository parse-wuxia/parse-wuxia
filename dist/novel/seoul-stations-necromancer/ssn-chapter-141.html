<p><span style="">Chapter 141 - Meteors</span></p><p><span style="">Gwah-gwah-gwahng! </span></p><p><span style="">The aftermath of the explosion was incredible. Several dozen Skeleton Mages were swept away. &#xA0;Woojin was hunting by himself, so fortunately, soldiers and his familiars weren&apos;t by his side.</span></p><p><span style="">Hooooohng! </span></p><p><span style="">The wrecks of the leftover buildings were swept up into the shockwave, and it was dispersed into the surrounding. &#xA0;When the dust settled down, Woojin retracted his barrier then he approached Jaenis.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;How does it feel being released from the seal?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">[Do you think I had fun during the time I had lost?] </span></p><p><span style="">Woojin shrugged his shoulders. &#xA0;He&apos;d never experienced being in the Room of Seal, and he never experienced death.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;You probably have a lot of questions for me. Let&apos;s tidy up the battlefield first.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">[That sounds like a good idea.] </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;You should team up with Ramson.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">[I&apos;ll do so.] </span></p><p><span style="">Woojin quickly grabbed Jaenis, who was about to disappear.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Oh yeah. &#xA0;Don&apos;t kill any humans.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">[Your words make no sense.] </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Don&apos;t kill them.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">[&#x2026;as the lord wants.] </span></p><p><span style="">Hwee-ree-reek. </span></p><p><span style="">Jaenis disappeared as his body turned into black smoke.</span></p><p><span style="">The Lich never went back on his spoken words, so he wouldn&apos;t harm the humans. &#xA0;This will cause the eradication of the monsters to be slowed down. &#xA0;However, he couldn&apos;t torch the entire cottage, because he wanted to catch the bedbugs.</span></p><p><span style="">If Woojin hadn&apos;t cautioned Jaenis, he would have indiscriminately bombarded the city of Seoul.</span></p><p><span style="">That would have been the quickest way to eradicate all the monsters.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Shall I check myself out a little bit?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">He was level 80 now.</span></p><p><span style="">His Warrior&apos;s Weapon had evolved over time, and he had just passed another hurdle where another evolution to his weapon would happen.</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin opened his Skill Window.</span></p><p><span style="">&lt;Steel Staff&gt; </span></p><p><span style="">A warrior&#x2019;s weapon was basically one&#x2019;s best friend, and they are akin to one&#x2019;s life. The Warrior&#x2019;s weapon grew alongside the user. It is always with you, and it is always ready to come out at your beck and call.</span></p><p><span style="">Effect : Strength +30, Speed +30, Health +30, Durability Recovery(Dispelled State)</span></p><p><span style="">Skill : Summon, Dispel, Transform (Spear, Hammer, Axe, Great Sword, Bow, Long Sword, Throwing Knives)</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Throwing Knives?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">The 8th transformation form was already determined. </span></p><p><span style="">His weapon&apos;s buff effect had started out at &#x2018;Strength +5&#x2019;, but now it was +30. &#xA0;Moreover, there were additional effect of Speed and Health.</span></p><p><span style="">When he reached level 90, his weapon arsenal will expand further, and the increased Stats would be immense.</span></p><p><span style="">If one wanted to walk the road of a Warrior Class, the Warrior&apos;s Weapon was an inseparable companion.</span></p><p><span style="">Chul-goo-ruhk.</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin&apos;s weapon changed form. &#xA0;Three small throwing knives appeared in his hand instead of the Steel Staff. &#xA0;Each of the throwing knives was of a different size. &#xA0;The first one had a blade that was about a handspan in length, and it could be used like a dagger. &#xA0;The entire length of the second knife was about a handspan in length, and it was like a small ornamental silver knife. &#xA0;The last one was like a mid-sized throwing knife.</span></p><p><span style="">Sha-rahk, shweek.</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin summoned and dispelled the weapon several times. The weapon repeatedly disappeared, and reappeared in his hand. He was also able to freely change the size of the Throwing Knives, so he could summon throwing knives ideal for the palm of his hands.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What are the skills I can learn?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Woojin opened the Achievement Store to buy the level 80 Skills that had been unlocked. &#xA0;He bought the Skills that was exclusive to the Warrior Class.</span></p><p><span style="">&lt;Knife Fighting&gt;, &lt;Knife Throwing Technique&gt;, &lt;Battle Roar&gt; </span></p><p><span style="">There were two weapon skills that was self explanatory. &#xA0;However, he was curious about the effect of the last Skill.</span></p><p><span style="">&lt;Battle Roar&gt; </span></p><p><span style="">During a hard fight, the Warrior&apos;s yell will boost the spirit of one&apos;s allies.</span></p><p><span style="">Effect : Increased Morale, Increased Battle Capability</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin smiled when he saw the description of the Skill.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;It&apos;s a Group Buff.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Until level 70, the skills given to him strengthened the Warrior. &#xA0;The first Buff skill appeared at level 80. &#xA0;It had also been a Buff where his yell would affect the allies in his vicinity. It was an aoe buff.</span></p><p><span style="">The battle was slowly coming to an end. &#xA0;Woojin headed towards Namsan where he decided to try out his new weapon skills. </span></p><p><span style="">Rajakui had planted vines, and it had grown all over the tower.</span></p><p><span style="">It would be a problem if the colony gained a foothold here. &#xA0;He had to quickly get rid of it.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Uh?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Woojin stopped in his tracks when he suddenly felt a sense of danger. &#xA0;He raised his head towards the sky.</span></p><p><span style="">Doo doo doo doo.</span></p><p><span style="">When he focused his senses, he felt the air vibrate. The clouds were shaped a bit funny too. His focused eyesight couldn&apos;t see anything, but he felt some kind of presence. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ha-ah.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Woojin shook his head from side to side.</span></p><p><span style="">Jaenis had an extreme hatred towards Trahnet.</span></p><p><span style="">He had deployed a meteor to destroy a functionless colony that yet to take hold here...</span></p><p><span style="">It was already too late to stop it.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;So I&apos;m the one, who will be responsible, for destroying the Namsan Tower again.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">The symbol of Seoul had been destroyed 5 years ago during the Dungeon Shock. &#xA0;It hadn&apos;t even been several years since it was rebuilt... &#xA0;He never expected he would be the cause of its destruction.</span></p><p><span style="">Any action taken by the Undead Army was his sole responsibility.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;This might not end at the tower. &#xA0;Namsan itself might be erased.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">He still had time before the meteor struck the mountain. &#xA0;Woojin looked around his surrounding. &#xA0;He got on his Phantom Steed Shing Shing, and they galloped away.</span></p><p><span style="">*** </span></p><p><span style="">Doo doo doo doo. &#xA0;Kwah-ahng! </span></p><p><span style="">The battlefield was noisy with the sounds of bullets being fired, and the explosions going off. In the midst of all of this, several cameras were taking in the sight of the battle.</span></p><p><span style="">A small monitor displayed the battle as if the battle was going on right in front of one&#x2019;s nose. &#xA0;In truth, the camera was positioned about 1 kilometer away.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Whew. This is beyond a mess.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">The flying monsters and the quick monsters were only 1 kilometer away, and that fact worried them. &#xA0;However, the army were at the final stage of the suppression, so the danger against them was a bit diminished.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Shale we get closer, producer?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;It&apos;s all right. Let&apos;s wait here. &#xA0;We&apos;ll go in after the gunfire dies down.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;The world is coming to an end. End.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">The producer reclined on a picnic chair, and he absentmindedly stared up at the sky.</span></p><p><span style="">There was no point in getting a scoop in this fucked up world. &#xA0;If he crossed into the no-go area set up by the army, he might get unlucky and get shot by friendly fire. &#xA0;If he died, he wouldn&apos;t be able to take up his grievances with anyone.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Uh? Isn&apos;t something coming our way?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What is it?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;It looks like a horse.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What? Dude. We are on a roof. Do you think a pegasus exist or something.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I...I&apos;m not lying&#x2026;.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ha. &#xA0;Stop being a bitch.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">The producer unnecessarily glared at his junior once, then he stood up from his chair. &#xA0;He put a cigarette in his mouth, and his face froze when he caught sight of what was on the other side of the balustrade of the rooftop.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;It&apos;s a horse.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I told you.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Who is it? &#xA0;Who&apos;s riding it?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Uh&#x2026; I...it kind of looks like Kahng-woojin?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Uh uh? I think you are right?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">The cigarette in the producer&apos;s mouth fell to the ground when he heard his junior colleague&apos;s words.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hey. &#xA0;Hurry up and turn the camera!&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">The camera had been zoomed-in to film the battlefield. &#xA0;The camera was turned towards the sky where it filmed the sight of Woojin racing across the sky. &#xA0;He was coming towards them on his Phantom Steed.</span></p><p><span style="">Heeeng. </span></p><p><span style="">When Shing Shing arrived at the rooftop balustrade, Woojin jumped off the horse.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Can we broadcast this live?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Woojin pointed towards the camera as he spoke. &#xA0;The producer mindlessly shook his head from side to side.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;We can&apos;t broadcast live. We send out a signal around every 10 minutes.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;That&apos;ll be too late.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">When Woojin frowned, the producer spoke quickly.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Do you have some urgent need? &#xA0;We can decrease the time to 1 minute.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Woojin nodded his head at those words.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;There is a meteor coming down on Namsan. &#xA0;Tell the nearby civilians to be prepared.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What? A meteor?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;How many news crews are around Namsan?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;There are four teams.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Pass on a message for me. &#xA0;Can you contact the army?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I...if you wait a moment, I can look up the contact information....&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;It&apos;s all right. &#xA0;It&apos;ll be faster for me to just go there.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">The nearby civilians had all been evacuated when Rajakui gathered the monsters around Namsan. &#xA0;When the meteor fell, the biggest casualties would come from the military.</span></p><p><span style="">Heeeeeng. </span></p><p><span style="">After Woojin delivered his message, Woojin rode Shing Shing towards the army. &#xA0;The producer just stared after Woojin&apos;s back.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Producer! Should be broadcast this immediately?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;Jaesung-ah. &#xA0;Did I really just talk to Kahng-woojin?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes! You did.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Huh&#x2026;.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Jaesung, the junior employee, spoke. &#xA0;The producer had a dazed expression on his face as if he was dreaming.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Senior! What do I do with the newest footage!&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What do you think?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">The producer immediately made a call.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Vice president! I got a scoop. &#xA0;The footage I just sent should be aired immediately after being edited.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Woojin had disappeared from his sight, but the producer continued to stare toward&#x2019;s Woojin&#x2019;s flight path with the phone pressed to his ear.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hero Kahng-woojin saw through the Dragon&apos;s plan. The Dragon summoned a meteor.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">There wasn&apos;t anything Woojin couldn&apos;t do.</span></p><p><span style="">What would have happened to Seoul again if he wasn&apos;t here? &#xA0;There had been several locations where the monsters had gathered, and Kahng-woojin&apos;s familiars had destroyed them all.</span></p><p><span style="">The army was clearing out remnant of the monsters.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;He said the meteor will fall on Namsan soon. He said everyone should evacuate.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">He didn&apos;t even have to debate if his information had come from a reliable source. &#xA0;Kahng-woojin wasn&apos;t someone who would lie. This was how the people perceived Kahng-woojin. &#xA0;His words carried weight.</span></p><p><span style="">The producer&apos;s voice was shaking from a weird sense of pride. </span></p><p><span style="">Is this how members of the earth&apos;s defense force felt? &#xA0;He had only delivered Kahng-woojin&apos;s words, but wouldn&apos;t that contribute in a big way towards saving Seoul? He never felt more pride at his choice of occupation. </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;He has saved Seoul once again.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">*** </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;We can&apos;t retreat. &#xA0;It is my job to protect this place.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Woojin shrugged his shoulders at the commander&apos;s words.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;If you insist on dying then I won&apos;t dissuade you.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Woojin unfurled a finger, and he pointed towards the sky. &#xA0;The clouds were rippling like waves.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;In about 10 minutes, you&apos;ll be able to see it yourself. &#xA0;If you retreat at that time, you&apos;ll all die.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;&#x2026;.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;If you want to live, you have to retreat now. &#xA0;However, if you have a death wish, I won&apos;t stop you.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Woojin had delivered his intentions.</span></p><p><span style="">He didn&apos;t like the senseless loss of lives, but he didn&apos;t feel any moral obligation where he had to save everyone.</span></p><p><span style="">He had informed them of the danger, and that was enough. &#xA0;He wasn&apos;t their nanny....</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;If we do that, the monsters will spread out into the city.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I&apos;ll block them.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;&#x2026;.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What are you going to do?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I&apos;ll withdraw my forces.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Woojin smirked. </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hurry up and go.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">After speaking those words, Woojin headed to the front line. If he wanted to help the army&#x2019;s retreat, he had to hold back the monsters. The soldiers saluted Woojin as they left.</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin summoned his bone spears, and he threw it to various locations.</span></p><p><span style="">Chwah-roo-roohk! </span></p><p><span style="">The bones grew and they immediately intersected to form a Wall of Bones. &#xA0;Since he was creating the Bone Wall across a large swath of land, a very large amount of magic escaped his body.</span></p><p><span style="">He mumbled as he drank the magic potion he bought from the Achievement Store.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Jeez, Jaenis. You created a lot of inconvenience for a lot of people.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Since he said not to harm any people, it shouldn&apos;t be a big meteor. &#xA0;Still, the shockwave created by the impact couldn&apos;t be ignored.</span></p><p><span style="">Fortunately, Jaenis&apos; skill was so great that he was very accurate with his magic. &#xA0;There weren&apos;t going to be any mishaps where the meteor would fall somewhere else. </span></p><p><span style="">The Namsan Tower was almost a sure loss, and the nearby residents will be leveled. &#xA0;There wouldn&apos;t be any human casualties, but the monsters hiding inside the forest will be annihilated.</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin surrounded the monsters with the Wall of Bones before they could escape.</span></p><p><span style="">If there was a strong resistance from the monsters, he wouldn&apos;t use his depleted magic. &#xA0;He would fight them using the Warrior&apos;s Skills.</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin was keeping back the monsters by himself after the army left. &#xA0;At that moment, a black smoke coalesced into forming the Lich Jaenis.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;How come you called a meteor down here?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">[Goo-ha-ha. It is me knocking on earth&apos;s door.] </span></p><p><span style="">Woojin looked as if he had just chewed on shit.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;If you observe your manners one more time, earth will be completely decimated next time.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">[Goo-ha-ha-ha. There won&apos;t be any casualties from this.] </span></p><p><span style="">A sigh left Woojin&apos;s mouth. </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Is it a small one?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">[It is only a small rock that&apos;s being used as a greeting.] </span></p><p><span style="">The problem was the fact that the small rock contained an enormous amount of destructive force. </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Please put a barrier over Alandal&apos;s buildings.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">[Who cares about the buildings?] </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;My family is there.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">[&#x2026;my bad.] </span></p><p><span style="">Jaenis&apos; body turned into black smoke, and he dispersed into the air. &#xA0;Woojin let out a sigh as he stared up at the sky.</span></p><p><span style="">Twinkle.</span></p><p><span style="">The small light was quite accurate as it headed towards Namsan. &#xA0;After it became visible to the naked eyes, it only took several seconds for it to impact the earth. </span></p><p><span style="">Ggo-ah-ahng! </span></p><p><span style="">After the impact, the delayed sound of explosion rang out. &#xA0;The ground shook, and Woojin&apos;s Soul armor activated. &#xA0;It covered his entire body.</span></p><p><span style="">The ground was so decimated that there wasn&apos;t even a trace of the Namsan Tower left. &#xA0;Moreover, a big hole was formed at Namsan. The mushroom cloud rose up with the dust, and this wasn&apos;t happening only in Seoul.</span></p>
