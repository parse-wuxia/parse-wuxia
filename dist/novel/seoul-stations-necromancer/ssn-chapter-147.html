<p><span style="">Chapter 147 - Expedition</span></p><p><span style="">It was as Minchan had predicted. &#xA0;Woojin had already returned to Alandal.</span></p><p><span style="">It took him less than five minutes to travel from London to Seoul....</span></p><p><span style="">It was where the Dungeon, which may be last bulwark of civilization, was located at.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I came here to fulfill my promise.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Blanka puffed out his chest as he entered the president&apos;s room, and he stood in front of Woojin.</span></p><p><span style="">Minchan and Soonghoon had entered together with Blanka, so Woojin asked them a question.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Why are you guys coming in together?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;We met him at the entrance.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hmm. &#xA0;Everyone take a seat.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">At Woojin&apos;s words, they sat in the sofa located on the other side of Woojin. A secretary brought in tea. </span></p><p><span style="">In recent days, the number of people visiting Alandal had increased significantly.</span></p><p><span style="">Under the skies of Seoul, the safest land was considered to be near the Seoul Station. It was the private lands of Alandal.</span></p><p><span style="">Even though there wasn&apos;t any public recruitment going on, people and beggars came in droves to ask about jobs at the guild. &#xA0;It seemed Blanka had been mistaken for a foreigner looking for work, and he had been detained.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Why were you so late?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;The guard at the entrance prevented me from getting here faster. &#xA0;It was a sad situation.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">He had been treated as a foreign laborer, so Blanka had been very disappointed by his treatment. Woojin smirked as he looked at Blanka.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I bet you are lying. &#xA0;You probably didn&apos;t want to come here from India.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;N...no way. &#xA0;I wanted to come here.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Blanka&apos;s flustered expression pretty much confirmed Woojin&apos;s suspicion.</span></p><p><span style="">Well, it didn&apos;t matter. &#xA0;It didn&apos;t matter what worries and lingering attachments he had before. In the end, he had come here.</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin had gained a pretty good Buffer.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Do you have any message for me from Vishnu guild master?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;He said to tell you that he had kept his promise.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Woojin smirked.</span></p><p><span style="">He had gained a high quality fighter in exchange for a Dungeon in Delhi.</span></p><p><span style="">The Vishnu guild master probably thought hard about taking the loss and keeping Blanka. &#xA0;As he was doing such calculations, the Dungeons had Broken again, and he had to help the army fight the Monster lord.</span></p><p><span style="">What would happen if another calamity occurred inside India?</span></p><p><span style="">As an insurance for some unknown disaster in the future, the guild master quickly sent Blanka to consummate the promise.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I said I would help out twice?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">He had promised to clear the Reset Dungeons that the Vishnu guild couldn&apos;t handle. Moreover, he had promised to give 100% of the rights to running those Dungeons.</span></p><p><span style="">From their perspective, the rights to running the Dungeon was an added benefit. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">What they really wanted was the assurance that Woojin would save India twice from future calamities. </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Well, all right. &#xA0;I want to welcome you to Alandal.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Please take care of me from now on.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">When the conversation came to a close, Jung-minchan shook Blanka&apos;s hand. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Welcome. &#xA0;My name is Jung-minchan.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;It is nice to meet you.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Your Korean is very good.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Blanka was a famous Roused in India. &#xA0;Jung-minchan already knew who he was. &#xA0;Minchan had also been told about Blanka being scouted, so he was well informed on the situation. </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;How should we treat Mr. Blanka, president? &#xA0;Is he part of Alandal now or was he dispatched here by his former guild?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Are you asking if he is a hostage or a slave...&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">At Woojin&apos;s words, Jung-minchan let out a forced laugh as he wiped at the sweat forming on his forehead.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;It doesn&apos;t matter if he was sold or loaned. &#xA0;Just treat him how you like.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;&#x2026;.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Woojin didn&apos;t care whether Blanka&apos;s allegiance lay with him or not. &#xA0;The important part was the fact that he&apos;ll be able to use Blanka as a Buffer.</span></p><p><span style="">After his work was done, Woojin didn&apos;t care if Blanka remained at Alandal or go back to India.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ha ha. I&apos;ll take care of everything.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;All right.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Woojin gave an adequate response, and he tilted his head in confusion when he saw Minchan and Soonghoon keep smiling at him.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Why do you guys keep smiling at me?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;We finalized the treaty today.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Minchan opened his briefcase, and he took out a thick envelope. Woojin pushed away the documents when Minchan tried to hand it to him.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Just give me the outline.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;There are two points that are important.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What is it?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;The city state of Alandal was given its independence by Korea.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What&apos;s the other point?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;The constitutional law was modified, so we are allowed to have dual citizenship. &#xA0;The citizens of Alandal won&#x2019;t have to give up their Korean citizenship.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Good.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Alandal would finally be treated like the Vatican.</span></p><p><span style="">This would mean employees could commute to the city state of Alandal like a regular job now.</span></p><p><span style="">They would have all the rights of a Korean, while at the same time, they would be citizens of Alandal. This would lessen the worry felt by the employees.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;It is thanks to the president. &#xA0;Shall I call you your majesty now?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Dude. You should most definitely call me your majesty.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;&#x2026;.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Minchan had suggested it in jest, so the cat got his tongue. &#xA0;Minchan stuttered as he looked at Woojin&apos;s serious face.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes, your majesty.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Dude. &#xA0;I was joking.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ha ha.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">It really didn&apos;t seem like a joke&#x2026;. </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Well, I insisted on independence for our convenience. &#xA0;You can call me whatever you want.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">At that moment, an employee from the secretary office knocked before coming into the room.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Director Hong-sunggoo has just arrived.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Woojin got up from his seat.</span></p><p><span style="">He had been wasting time in the president&apos;s office, because he had been waiting for Sunggoo to return.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Where are you going?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I&apos;m going to go train. Most of us are here now.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Mmmm. Could you give a speech announcing the establishment of our country before you go?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;You do it. &#xA0;This is why I handed you the seat of Prime minister.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;as the constitutional monarch, you should give a speech.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;All right. &#xA0;Go gather everyone right now. &#xA0;I&apos;ll be gone for several days.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I&apos;ll go make the preparations.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Jung-minchan knew Woojin&apos;s personality, so he knew he had to be quick in his preparation. &#xA0;He exited the president&apos;s room. &#xA0;Soonghoon also got up from his seat.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Then I&apos;ll be heading out too.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;All right. &#xA0;Also, you should contact the Hammer guild. They were suppose to set up the general assembly of guilds, so why haven&apos;t they contacted me?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ah! I&apos;ll immediately find out about it.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">After he said farewell with Soonghoon, Blanka discreetly got up from the sofa.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I will also&#x2026;.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;You stay here.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Blanka sat back down on the sofa, and he asked a question he was curious about.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Am I a hostage now?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;You can be whatever you want.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;&#x2026;.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">What kind of response was that?</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I chose to come here out of my own volition.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Did I say otherwise?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I volunteered to become Alandal&apos;s&#x2026;.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;A guilty conscience needs no accuser. &#xA0;Just stay here and greet the other members when they get here.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;yes.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">After they returned from clearing a Dungeon, Sunggoo and Haesol arrived at the president&apos;s room.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Did you ask for me, hyung-nim?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes. &#xA0;Come sit here.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Uh. &#xA0;Blanka?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;It&apos;s been awhile.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Heh heh. Did you just get here?&#x201C; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes. &#xA0;I volunteered to become a citizen of Alandal.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;&#x2026;?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Sunggoo was confused by his odd statement.</span></p><p><span style="">Haesol, who was next to Sunggoo, put her hand out in greeting.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Welcome.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ah, yes.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Comrade.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;&#x2026;.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">When they shook hands, why did Blanka feel a fierce delight coming from Haesol?</span></p><p><span style="">Haesol and Sunggoo fussed over Blanka, since he will share the same fate as them.</span></p><p><span style="">The Holy Maiden came into the president&apos;s room in the midst of their conversation.</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin&apos;s face darkened a little bit at her visit.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;How&apos;s Sooah doing?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;She is about to molt.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Will she be a Holy Maiden to a god or a goddess?</span></p><p><span style="">It didn&apos;t matter in the end. &#xA0;She&apos;ll become an agent for the newly awakened god.</span></p><p><span style="">If she can&apos;t endure the process, she&apos;ll die. &#xA0;If she can endure it, she&apos;ll become Awakened. The periodic seizures was still occurring, and it was a step she had to go through to be able to adapt to her new reality.</span></p><p><span style="">The shadow casting over Woojin&apos;s face quickly disappeared.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Everyone is here now. Everyone sit.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;&#x2026;.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">The Roused affiliated with Alandal was all gathered here. Every one of them had ability and Rank that couldn&apos;t be ignored.</span></p><p><span style="">They were small in number, but they were equal to most guilds in terms of quality. &#xA0;On top of that, Woojin was someone that had power beyond the capability of a guild. &#xA0;His battle potential came close to what countries had.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I want you guys to go on an expedition to a different planet.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Are we going to Alphen?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Not yet..&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">He had recently purchased a Dungeon on Alphen. There were so many challengers attempting to clear his Dungeon, so he had to send Kiba to protect his Dimensional Domain. &#xA0;Kiba was leading a busy life.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I&apos;m going to Planet Jaku.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hmm.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Even if they were to talk about it, they didn&apos;t have any information regarding the topic.</span></p><p><span style="">They just had to follow Woojin&apos;s direction as he revealed more information to them.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Rajakui, who linked to earth, is part of the Yellow Lizard Coalition. We are going to go there to hunt in their Dungeons.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;We are going too?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">At Haesol&apos;s question, Woojin nodded his head.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;We should go to their main headquarters if we are going to create a battlefield. &#xA0;Do you want to fight on earth?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;You are correct in your decision.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">They would be able to receive powerful fire support on their home ground. &#xA0;However, this wasn&apos;t about victories and losses. It wasn&apos;t a good idea to cause harm to earth. &#xA0;If they were going to stage a war, it would be better to do it on the enemy&apos;s front lawn.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I&apos;m dividing our group into three parties. I&apos;m going to move by myself. You guys hunt by cooperating with each other.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What about the last party?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What do you think?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Woojin grinned as he looked at Sunggoo.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Sunggoo. &#xA0;You are going to learn from Jaenis as you follow him.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;&#x2026;.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">The day was finally here.</span></p><p><span style="">Sunggoo&apos;s complexion darkened.</span></p><p><span style="">*** </span></p><p><span style="">Originally, Alandal was a site set up for military use, and it was divided into three regions.</span></p><p><span style="">There was a simple yet enormous building that was built like a school. A gymnasium was located next to the main building. &#xA0;There was also a quarantine zone named &apos;Che-haesol&apos;s Safari&apos;. It was where the Tamed monsters were located at. &#xA0;They were dependable allies that would help out in emergencies.</span></p><p><span style="">All of Alandal&apos;s employees were gathered inside the gym.</span></p><p><span style="">One could also see several reporters Minchan had quickly invited over.</span></p><p><span style="">Chairs were placed on top of a stage. The founding members and key figures of Alandal was sitting on top of the stage.</span></p><p><span style="">Kahng-woojin discreetly asked Minchan a question when he saw the gym packed with people.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;We have this much people?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;They are outstanding individuals I picked out with great care.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;&#x2026;.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Woojin never expected the number of outstanding individual they hired would approach close to a thousand.</span></p><p><span style="">There were less than 10 Roused in Alandal, yet there were so many employees in the Support division...</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I guess we have to pick up some more Roused.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Actually, we are being flooded by applicants. We are even being overwhelmed by applications sent in by Rank B and higher Roused.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Alandal was currently the greatest guild on earth. &#xA0;No, they had become a country...</span></p><p><span style="">Woo-soonghoon&apos;s voice rang out as he spoke into the microphone.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;We will now start the pronouncement of Alandal being established as a country. First&#x2026;.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Soonghoon was reading off a hastily made speech when he felt a hand on his shoulder. &#xA0;He turned to look, and Woojin was standing next to him.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Stand aside. At this rate, this will take the whole day.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Woojin walked past the podium to stand in front of the stage. &#xA0;He didn&apos;t need a microphone.</span></p><p><span style="">Sha-rah-rah-rahk. </span></p><p><span style="">Black smoke gathered around Woojin, and it coalesced to form him familiars.</span></p><p><span style="">Weeeeeeng. </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I was having fun playing with teacher Jaemin. Why did you call me?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">[My lord!] </span></p><p><span style="">[Do you need the use of Ramson&apos;s hammer?] </span></p><p><span style="">[Gooh-ha-ha. &#xA0;Are we hunting humans this time?] </span></p><p><span style="">The familiars chattered loudly after being summoned, and the stage was packed now.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Everyone be quiet.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Woojin looked down at the employees from the stage.</span></p><p><span style="">These were the people chosen by Jung-minchan, who was simultaneously the vice president and the prime minister of Alandal. &#xA0;However, these people had gathered under the name of Alandal.</span></p><p><span style="">If a group was gathered, the group should at the very least share the same vision as the leader.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I was summoned to Alphen 5 years ago, and I lived with death by my side for 20 years.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Woojin didn&apos;t have a microphone, but his voice rang out to all corners of the gym. His voice was filled with potent magic, and his voice could be heard by all ears.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;The monsters that swallowed Alphen is gunning for earth.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">When he spoke about it in those terms, it increased the anger felt by everyone. </span></p><p><span style="">Woojin&apos;s voice flared up a level.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Those who fight with me will become my comrade! &#xA0;Those who run away will become my comrade in death!&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">[Goo-ohhhhhhh!] </span></p><p><span style="">The Death Knights let out a roar.</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin continued to speak towards the slightly frightened employees.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;If you came here thinking Alandal was the safest bunker you could find, you are sorely mistaken. &#xA0;This place is the front line of the battlefield.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">He wasn&apos;t wrong. &#xA0;He had numerous Dimensional lords, who had enmity towards Woojin. The Monster lords had appeared en masse at Seoul in the latest incident.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Those who gather under the name of Alandal will all become warriors!&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">It didn&apos;t matter if they were alive or dead.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;If you want to die, then run.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">It didn&apos;t matter if they ran away in fright. &#xA0;This was why he was scaring them right now. &#xA0;It would be best for those, who didn&apos;t have courage, to follow him as Undeads.</span></p><p><span style="">The precipice of hell was a step away in front of Alandal.</span></p><p><span style="">It was a land closest to the boundary that separated life and death.</span></p><p><span style="">If they followed Woojin, they will cross death&apos;s door in style.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I declare the founding of Alandal.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">People with drawn faces watched as Woojin gave his declaration.</span></p>
