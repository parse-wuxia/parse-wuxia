<p>Chapter 202 - God of Destruction (2)</p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Earth.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;This is earth.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The tail end of Woojin&apos;s lips lifted.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I&#x2019;m not talking about the fake one.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">He looked at the Dimensional Admin, who didn&#x2019;t give an answer. &#xA0;It was as if he was staring at an Overmind made out of red light. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">What reason did it have to put on an armor&#x2026;.</span></p><p><span style="">Was it mimicking a human? &#xA0;Or did it have some other function? &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">He couldn&#x2019;t even come up with a guess as to the reason why.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Why aren&#x2019;t you answering me?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What is fake and what is real?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The voice rang out, and it shook within his head.</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin was about to give an immediate answer, but he swallowed his words. </span></p><p><span style="">What defined something as being real or fake?</span></p><p><span style="">What characterized reality and virtual reality&#x2026;..</span></p><p><span style="">When he became tormented by his thoughts, Woojin shook his head as if to chase away such thoughts. &#xA0;It didn&#x2019;t matter which form of reality was of substance.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Moon World. &#xA0;I want you to send me there.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;You can&#x2019;t go there.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">At the Dimensional Admin&#x2019;s words, Woojin&#x2019;s expression hardened.</span></p><p><span style="">Was Toppler correct? &#xA0;Was it true that this world was the fake one? &#xA0;If there really was a partition between reality and the virtual world, the Dimensional Admin was a product of the virtual reality. &#xA0;It meant the Dimensional Admin couldn&#x2019;t send him to the Moon World, since it was located in reality.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Why?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">The silence was a sufficient answer.</span></p><p><span style="">If the Dimensional Admin had no solution, Woojin had only one business with him.</span></p><p><span style="">Shwahhk.</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin summoned his Warrior&#x2019;s Weapon, and he raised it.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;You should die now.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">It gave no answer&#x2026;. </span></p><p><span style="">However, it moved.</span></p><p><span style="">Would it be more accurate to say it wriggled?</span></p><p><span style="">The Dimensional Admin was made out of light, and one couldn&#x2019;t discern its expression. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">Choo-cho-choot.</span></p><p><span style="">It was letting out a serious amount of energy as the light grew bigger. &#xA0;It looked as if thunder was being compressed. &#xA0;It was as if the mass of light was resolving into a light golem in human form.</span></p><p><span style="">Previously, it looked as if the Dimensional Admin had been wearing loose fitting armor. &#xA0;However, as the Dimensional Admin&#x2019;s body grew, the armor fit its body perfectly. &#xA0;The arms and legs extended, and it was around 3 meters tall now.</span></p><p><span style="">Koo-rooh-roong.</span></p><p><span style="">A spark like thunder was emitted every time it moved its body. &#xA0;Even without fighting against it, Woojin could feel the explosive power dwelling within it.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;If you want to challenge me, I welcome it.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin looked at it with serious eyes. &#xA0;He spoke with a confident voice towards the 72nd Throne.</span></p><p><span style="">Will he be able to win?</span></p><p><span style="">Was it because its presence was so overwhelming? It had been a while, since he had such thoughts before a fight.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hmmph.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">As if to chase away his anxiety, Woojin charged towards the large form.</span></p><p><span style="">He didn&#x2019;t care if the bastard was made out of light.</span></p><p><span style="">He just had to kill it.</span></p><p><span style="">Kwah-jee-jeek!</span></p><p><span style="">The Warrior&#x2019;s Weapon penetrated the 72nd Throne&#x2019;s forearm. &#xA0;The spear entered with no resistance. &#xA0;When Woojin tried to take it out, it refused to come out. &#xA0;It was as if it was embedded in concrete.</span></p><p><span style="">Koo-roo-roohng.</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin was unsure as to how he should describe it. &#xA0;He didn&#x2019;t know if it was a wound or a gap. &#xA0;He could see its forearm wriggle. &#xA0;He was pulling with incredible force, yet the spear refused to move an inch.</span></p><p><span style="">Shwahhk, kwahng!</span></p><p><span style="">The bastard&#x2019;s fist struck Woojin&#x2019;s side.</span></p><p><span style="">Puh-uhk!</span></p><p><span style="">He impacted on a dune as he was buried within the sand. &#xA0;He erupted out from below as he rushed towards it.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Summon.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin unsummoned then summoned his Warrior&#x2019;s Weapon. &#xA0;He changed it into its great sword form.</span></p><p><span style="">The Warrior&#x2019;s Weapon could change its form freely, and he could recover it. &#xA0;The battle style one could develop with such a weapon was endless.</span></p><p><span style="">Chwahhhng!</span></p><p><span style="">The great sword sliced through the enormous forearm as if it was passing through water. &#xA0;However, the forearm reattached itself so easily that it made one wonder if it had been severed in the first place.</span></p><p><span style="">Shwahng, juwahng!</span></p><p><span style="">It didn&#x2019;t matter if he sliced its neck or leg. &#xA0;The result was the same.</span></p><p><span style="">It was hopeless, since he was swinging his sword at a being with no real body.</span></p><p><span style="">Kwahhhng!</span></p><p><span style="">When he let his guard down for a brief moment, it punched him. &#xA0;Woojin was sent flying. &#xA0;He stood up as he spat out sand from his mouth.</span></p><p><span style="">He hadn&#x2019;t taken any damage. &#xA0;The Soul Armor had activated, and the exact number of souls needed to block the attack was consumed.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Shit.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">It was neither a human nor a monster.</span></p><p><span style="">It was a being made out of light. &#xA0;It was basically an ethereal being, so how should he face this bastard? &#xA0;Its body was a mass of light.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What an annoying bastard.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin changed his Warrior&#x2019;s Weapon into a bow.</span></p><p><span style="">Shwahhng, shoo-shoohk!</span></p><p><span style="">He pulled only the string, yet an arrow made out light appeared. &#xA0;It embedded itself in the bastard. &#xA0;The arrow in flight acted as if it was caught in a magnetic field. &#xA0;It slowed before it was absorbed into the Dimensional Admin&#x2019;s body.</span></p><p><span style="">Shoo-shoohk, shoong!</span></p><p><span style="">It seemed physical attacks didn&#x2019;t work, and the arrow of light was also useless.</span></p><p><span style="">Should he call his familiars to fight this bastard?</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;I&#x2019;ll be wasting my magical energy.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">He didn&#x2019;t know how useful his Skeleton Army or his Death Knights would be. &#xA0;He wasn&#x2019;t certain, but he was pretty sure Yong Yong would be much help either.</span></p><p><span style="">He thought about calling for Lich Jaenis, but he gave up on that idea too.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;I have to conserve my magical energy.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">Even if it didn&#x2019;t have real body, the bastard should have a soul.</span></p><p><span style="">He decided to bet everything on Thrash&#x2019;s Punishment.</span></p><p><span style="">Shwahk!</span></p><p><span style="">When several throwing knives flew towards the Dimensional Admin, it punched the knives to block all of them.</span></p><p><span style="">Choo-ah-ahng!</span></p><p><span style="">The hand of light had held onto one of the throwing knives.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Armor?&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">All the ones aiming for its body went through cleanly. &#xA0;It wasn&#x2019;t as if his weapons were passing through after creating a wound. &#xA0;It was correct to say the Dimensional Admin was letting the weapons just pass through its body.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Is the armor covering some kind of nucleus?&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">It was a likely hypothesis.</span></p><p><span style="">It was a being made out a specific element, and it needed a focus to act as a nucleus. &#xA0;If this wasn&#x2019;t the case, it was either a soul or a ghost.</span></p><p><span style="">It was covering its only weakness with armor, so it didn&#x2019;t matter what it was. &#xA0;Since the bastard had self-awareness, it possessed a soul.</span></p><p><span style="">Chwahhhk!</span></p><p><span style="">The throwing knives disappeared, and in a flash, a whip was in his hand. &#xA0;The malleable Warrior&#x2019;s Weapon kept changing its form, and the battle changed again in a free flowing manner.</span></p><p><span style="">The whip flew like a snake uncoiling. &#xA0;It surrounded the Dimensional Admin&#x2019;s armor. &#xA0;This was the only material that would allow him to restrict the Dimensional Admin. &#xA0;It wouldn&#x2019;t be able to get out unless it strips off its armor.</span></p><p><span style="">Hoo-ooh-oohng.</span></p><p><span style="">When he pulled the whip, the Dimensional Admin&#x2019;s body flew forward with no resistance. &#xA0;It approached him quickly&#x2026;.</span></p><p><span style="">Kwahhhng!</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Koo-oohk.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The Dimensional Admin&#x2019;s fist once again made him roll across the sand. &#xA0;Woojin&#x2019;s lips split open, and he spat out the metallic tasting blood from his mouth.</span></p><p><span style="">His last batch of souls had been consumed. &#xA0;Since he didn&#x2019;t have the Soul Armor, its fist was very painful.</span></p><p><span style="">This opponent was on a different level compared to all the opponents he had fought before.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;This is annoying.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">From its appearance, Woojin had expected it to use an electric attack or an explosion created through pressurized energy. &#xA0;He thought it would attack with magic, yet it only used its fists.</span></p><p><span style="">The bastard&#x2019;s body ignored any forms of physical attack, and it felt as if its body wasn&#x2019;t even there.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Bitch.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin charged again. &#xA0;It would be great if he could use his magic to restrain the bastard. &#xA0;However, he couldn&#x2019;t waste a single ounce of magical energy.</span></p><p><span style="">If he did, he wouldn&#x2019;t be able to activate Thrash&#x2019;s Punishment.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I know what you are trying to do.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Is that so?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin grinned as he wiped the blood away from his lips.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Try blocking it.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Toohk&#xFF0C;toohk!</span></p><p><span style="">Sand flew into the air as he charged forward again.</span></p><p><span style="">Hoo-ooh-oong.</span></p><p><span style="">The Dimensional Admin was getting into its stance, and one could tell it was serious. &#xA0;The punches before were like swats trying to chase away a fly. &#xA0;This time it would be for real.</span></p><p><span style="">His bones could be crushed.</span></p><p><span style="">No, he had to worry about his life more so than his bones.</span></p><p><span style="">Toohng!</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin didn&#x2019;t stop his footsteps, and he once again jumped towards the body of the Dimensional Admin. &#xA0;He still had on a smile overflowing with confidence, but the Dimensional Admin was also smiling.</span></p><p><span style="">Koo-ooh-oohk.</span></p><p><span style="">It tried to punch, yet its arm didn&#x2019;t move. &#xA0;It was as if something was pulling from the back&#x2026;.. &#xA0;It looked as if its body was stuck&#x2026;.</span></p><p><span style="">Tuhk.</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin grinned as he held onto the armor.</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin was only an arm length away, and he could see the Dimensional Admin&#x2019;s face distort into an ugly expression.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Even if you know it is coming, you can&#x2019;t block it.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">It was a being made out of light, yet it was wearing an armor. &#xA0;This meant it was casting a shadow. &#xA0;Ggaebi was told to wait for this opportunity.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Good bye.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Woojin gripped the Dimensional Admin&#x2019;s head with his hands.</span></p><p><span style="">Shwahhhhh!</span></p><p><span style="">In an instant, his magical energy was drained, and he felt an absence within him. &#xA0;This feeling of emptiness didn&#x2019;t feel great, but he was also filled with triumph at winning against the Dimensional Admin.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ggooh-uh-uh-uh-uh!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">He saw its soul get sucked into Thrash&#x2019;s Punishment, and Woojin gripped his fists.</span></p><p><span style="">Tuh-ung.</span></p><p><span style="">The armor fell to the floor, and all the red light was sucked in.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hoo-ooh. &#xA0;This is the end.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">His stored souls had stopped several punches, and now he was drained of everything. &#xA0;If there were corpses or souls nearby, he would be able to absorb it to refill his magical energy. &#xA0;However, he had come to an isolated region, so there were no souls to be found.</span></p><p><span style="">He had blocked the absolute being from descending. </span></p><p><span style="">He had stopped a being that would have been a big threat to earth.</span></p><p><span style="">It probably needed a certain amount of time before it could revive. &#xA0;He had to find a way to get to the Moon World before Iello or the Dimensional Admin revives to cause trouble.</span></p><p><span style="">He&#x2019;ll be able to kill the god of earth on the Moon World. &#xA0;He&#x2019;ll be able to take its Code.</span></p><p><span style="">It was a method where he&#x2019;ll be able to acquire the Code, while keeping Sooah safe.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Shing Shi&#x2026;.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin was about to summon the Phantom Steed Shing Shing when he felt a large amount of magical energy emanating from the floor.</span></p><p><span style="">Chwahhhh.</span></p><p><span style="">The armor floated into the air, and it started to be filled with blue light. &#xA0;The being was formed again as it let out a blue light.</span></p><p><span style="">It continuously gathered energy from the surrounding as its presence became large. &#xA0;It made Woojin worried.</span></p><p><span style="">The unusual mass of light grew until it exploded forward. &#xA0;It was as if it was trying to swallow everything near it. </span></p><p><span style="">Ggoo-ahhhhhng!</span></p><p><span style="">A large sandstorm rose into the air as it blocked the sun. &#xA0;It obscured one&#x2019;s field of vision with darkness. &#xA0;One couldn&#x2019;t see an inch past one&#x2019;s nose, yet the Dimensional Admin started to flash as it regained its red coloring.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;In the end, the result hadn&#x2019;t changed.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">It had exhausted its power, yet it had won and survived. &#xA0;It had gathered all the Codes to the 72 Dimensions including earth. &#xA0;It just had to finish its work.&#x2026;.</span></p><p><span style="">[Koo-koo-koohk. &#xA0;How long have I waited for this moment?]</span></p><p><span style="">A large eye formed within the darkened space, and it laughed as it looked down at the Dimensional Admin.</span></p><p><span style="">The Shadow Imp Ggaebi let out a wicked laugh as it circled the Dimensional Admin.</span></p><p><span style="">[I have been awoken from the punishment of death. &#xA0;I will reveal myself to this world again.]</span></p><p><span style="">Ggaebi swirled around the Dimensional Admin&#x2019;s body as if it was compressing into it. &#xA0;The black shadow started to mix with the red light.</span></p><p><span style="">The red light darkened, and at some point, it had been dyed completely black.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Koo koo koo koo.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The darkness split into a wide grin as it laughed.</span></p><p><span style="">A descent by borrowing the body of a corpse?</span></p><p><span style="">It couldn&#x2019;t be compared to this.</span></p><p><span style="">This was a complete revival.</span></p><p><span style="">It was no longer an unstable being summoned by borrowing the power of a Necromancer. &#xA0;This was a perfect revival.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Koo-ha-ha-ha-ha!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">It was a being, who had created this world in the beginning&#x2026;.</span></p><p><span style="">After a long time, the absolute being of the Dimensions had descended.</span></p><p><span style="">Saurus Mountain&#x2019;s World Tree, Planet Alphen</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ah&#x2026;.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Holy Maiden Melody let out a sound of sadness. &#xA0;There was a man standing in front of her. &#xA0;He had translucent skin that made his skin look pale. &#xA0;She tried to push her hand forward&#x2026;.</span></p><p><span style="">Shwahhhh.</span></p><p><span style="">The man turned into black smoke, and it entered her hand. &#xA0;It was as if it was being absorbed.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ah ah&#x2026;.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">She could see souls. &#xA0;The dead were&#x2026;. &#xA0;She could see souls letting out cries of deep sadness. &#xA0;It felt as if their cries were filling up the world. &#xA0;Melody wanted to close her eyes, but she stood firm as she tried to get used to it.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hoo-ooh.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Even if she wanted to help them, she didn&#x2019;t know how. &#xA0;&#xA0;He wasn&#x2019;t as nice as the goddess of Prophecy. &#xA0;Moreover, he didn&#x2019;t send oracles.</span></p><p><span style="">At some point, she was able to see souls. &#xA0;She tried to embrace the souls, but they all turned into smoke when she did.</span></p><p><span style="">She was letting out a deep sigh when a welcomed friend arrived.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Holy Maiden.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Team leader Haesol!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">She was the woman from earth, who followed Kahng-woojin..</span></p><p><span style="">Che-haesol had returned.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Where have you been?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;I was trying to find a power that&#x2019;ll be of help to the king..&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Did you find the power?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">She spoke without hesitation, and her face was full of confidence. &#xA0;At that moment, the unquenchable fire in front of the World Tree was extinguished accompanying a wind.</span></p><p><span style="">Hwah-roo-roohk!</span></p><p><span style="">A flame suddenly rose as a shadow of a figure could be seen.</span></p>
