<p>Chapter 161 -We are the New Recruits (2)</p><p><span style="">&#x2018;I&apos;m dead.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">Kim-joonyong already had this thought before, and this thought had repeated itself countless of times.</span></p><p><span style="">The ground was sticky, and the overgrown trees were blocking his vision. &#xA0;It caused him to feel irritated.</span></p><p><span style="">Kee-ahhhhhk! </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Shit.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">He was now used to the sound of the Lizardman&apos;s cry. &#xA0;It was telling its comrade to gather, since it had found the preys. &#xA0;Unfortunately, the preys was the humans.</span></p><p><span style="">The prey was his Alandal comrades including himself.</span></p><p><span style="">[There are two target to your 9 o&apos;clock. &#xA0;Set the trap, then retreat to your 3 o&apos;clock.] </span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Shit.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">When Haesol&apos;s commands rang out in his head, Joonyong hurriedly set the magical trap, and he retreated. Unlike his grumblings, his footsteps didn&apos;t cause any sound as it brushed by the surrounding vegetation. &#xA0;His movements were stealthy.</span></p><p><span style="">Kwah-kwahng! </span></p><p><span style="">At the sound of the trap&apos;s activation, Haesol&apos;s additional order rang out in his head.</span></p><p><span style="">[Rejoin the team by heading toward your 7 o&apos;clock. You&apos;ll be participating in the close combat.] </span></p><p><span style="">Joonyong hurriedly oriented himself towards the direction indicated. &#xA0;The battle wasn&apos;t too far away from where he had set the trap.</span></p><p><span style="">Kyahhhhk! </span></p><p><span style="">His comrades will be there.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ha-ahp!&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">He let out a shout of concentration, and he started running with a low-grade sword in his hand. It was something he stole from a Lizardman. &#xA0;It had a pretty good balance, so it was quite useful.</span></p><p><span style="">Kwah-jeeek! </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Die...please.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">He was trying to extract the sword that was stuck on its thick hide. &#xA0;Joonyong was frantically kicking at the Lizardman, and he gathered his magical energy to emit an Electric Shock.</span></p><p><span style="">Pah-jee-jee=jeek! </span></p><p><span style="">Before he came here, he was a Rank E Roused that was able to use Telekinesis and Electric Shock. &#xA0;He was most often sent to the rear of the party. &#xA0;However, it was useless to have a strict structure in this place.</span></p><p><span style="">He had a role, but the work he had to do differed depending on the situation. &#xA0;One had to swing a sword, cooperate with others, use magic and set down traps. &#xA0;However, this wasn&apos;t special to him. &#xA0;All the members of the group had to learn numerous skills, and they were now quite adept at using those skills.</span></p><p><span style="">Only those who adapted quickly survived.</span></p><p><span style="">There were only 7 comrades left around him.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hoo-ooh-ooh.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Kim-joonyong looked at the battlefield with a cruel light in his eyes. &#xA0;Twelve Lizardmen had been ruthlessly killed.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Good job.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Joonyong quickly turned his head when he heard her actual voice. &#xA0;&#xA0;Che-haesol was looking at him as she smiled. &#xA0;He looked back at her with murder in his eyes.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Lower your eyes. &#xA0;If you have a complaint, come at me.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;&#x2026;.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Joonyong grudgingly lowered his gaze to the floor. &#xA0;He could oppose her, but it would all be in vain. &#xA0;He couldn&apos;t even measure up to the tip of her toes. &#xA0;She was only a Tamer, yet she was very good at fighting....</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;All right. &#xA0;We&apos;ll end the hunt right now, and we&apos;ll head back to the camp. &#xA0;Gather all the loot.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;&#x2026;.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Everyone wordlessly cut apart the Lizardmen to extract the Bloodstones. &#xA0;They were used to doing this now. &#xA0;Afterwards, they collected their weapons and defensive gears.</span></p><p><span style="">They had reached a point where it was more awkward to talk to each other through spoken words.</span></p><p><span style="">Haesol&apos;s Telepathic ability was most useful when commanding her own troops. &#xA0;However, the actual people being commanded felt like puppets on a string. &#xA0;It felt dirty to them.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;We are heading back.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Koo-ahhhhhng. </span></p><p><span style="">Haesol got on a puma that had been Tamed in a jungle. &#xA0;Haesol led them to a hidden camp that was located within a cracked boulder. &#xA0;Moreover, there were others already there.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Joonyong-ah!&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Lee-soohjin!&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">The one that yelled out in joy was Joonyong&apos;s teammate. &#xA0;Haesol had taken him away in the prior battle.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Uh? &#xA0;How&#x2026;.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">His limbs had been cut, and he had received a wound that would have killed anyone in short order. &#xA0;However, he....</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;The Holy Maiden healed me.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Huh. &#xA0;You are alive. &#xA0;You are still alive.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Had it only been several days since they started working together? </span></p><p><span style="">It had only been 6 days. &#xA0;However, they had formed an indescribable sense of kinship and camaraderie from the experiences they shared. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">They operated under the stress of battle, and the devilish Che-haesol kept pushing them forward. &#xA0;Of course, a tight bond would form under these circumstances.</span></p><p><span style="">The comrades he assumed to be dead were all alive. &#xA0;Moreover, they were in better shape than ever.</span></p><p><span style="">Che-haesol threw cold water on top of this meeting.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Get in a column of fours.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;&#x2026;.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">At Haesol&apos;s command, they quickly moved to get in formation.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;This is the supplies sent by the king. &#xA0;Only take the ones with your name on it. &#xA0;Go to it.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">There were numerous supply boxes stacked at the corner of the camp. &#xA0;It meant the content of each box varied.</span></p><p><span style="">They all picked up pretty large boxes, and they returned to their original spots.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;After you absorb all the Reinforcement Stones and Skill Books, you will all put on your equipments. &#xA0;Start!&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Get to it!&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Joonyong&apos;s eyes widen when he opened his box.</span></p><p><span style="">He held up a Reinforcement Stone that was the size of his fist. &#xA0;His eyes were spinning. &#xA0;In the past, he had guessed that the Reinforcement Stones given to him were expensive. &#xA0;However, he could now feel the immense magical energy within it now. &#xA0;His magical control and detection ability was heightened as he experienced neardeath situations. &#xA0;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;As expected of our king.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">He was giving them such precious Items without any qualms.</span></p><p><span style="">Joonyong absorbed all the Reinforcement Stones, and he learned 3 additional Skill Books.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;These Skills!&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">When one inserts magical energy into a Skill Book, the knowledge contained within the book was absorbed. &#xA0;He could see in his mind&#x2019;s eye as to how these abilities would be used. &#xA0;Kim-joonyong&apos;s body was trembling.</span></p><p><span style="">These were all the abilities he had wanted to learn in the past. &#xA0;These were the abilities he needed.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;I&apos;m sure of it! &#xA0;He is looking over me!&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">The media spoke about Kahng-woojin&apos;s overwhelming martial abilities, but they didn&apos;t look too kindly at his policy of ruling by force. &#xA0;However, Joonyong knew the truth now, since he had experienced it.</span></p><p><span style="">Kahng-woojin was a caring and thoughtful man. &#xA0;Even the Roused on the lowest rung was getting personal attention from him.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Oh. &#xA0;I can&apos;t believe this.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;This is everything I needed.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">It was the same for his comrades. &#xA0;They were all happy when they found out that the supplies were customized for them. &#xA0;It wasn&apos;t just the Skill Books. &#xA0;The equipments also differed.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Wow. &#xA0;Look at this body suit.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;It&apos;s a sword. &#xA0;This is perfect for me.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">This sword couldn&apos;t be compared to the one he stole from the Lizardman. &#xA0;He didn&apos;t know how his personal preferences were discerened.</span></p><p><span style="">Everyone held in their hands weapons that were perfect for them.</span></p><p><span style="">Then there was the armor that looked like a motorcycle suit. &#xA0;It clung to their body, and the key parts of the body were protected by a reinforcement of metal. &#xA0;This armor would allow them to avoid critical blows. </span></p><p><span style="">The armor was a mixture of red and black. &#xA0;Moreover, there was an engraving of a yawning cat on the shoulder and the chest.</span></p><p><span style="">It was the distinct emblem that represented the Dimensional Domain of Alandal.</span></p><p><span style="">Aside from the equipments, there were all types of consumables in there too. &#xA0;There were &#xA0;expensive potions and antidotes one could use in emergency. &#xA0;Then there were the artifacts that could be used for offence.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;The king&apos;s kindness is....&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">Joonyong couldn&apos;t stop his body from trembling. &#xA0;What other guild would support their members to this extent? &#xA0;He was only a Rank E Roused. &#xA0;He had never received such a treatment before.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hurry up and put it on!&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">If it wasn&apos;t for the ball busting drill instructor Che-Haesol, who was also his immediate superior, he would have basked a little bit more in this ecstasy. &#xA0;However, there were still 6 days before they were scheduled to return to earth.</span></p><p><span style="">Che-haesol had on a strict face, but she was smiling inside.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Everyone is happy.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">Haesol had kept track of all 23 new recruits. &#xA0;She had come up with suitable weapons and Skills that would complement their battle styles. &#xA0;She also assessed their abilities before she had sent a report.</span></p><p><span style="">Kahng-woojin unhesitatingly bought the equipments and Items from his Dimensional Store, and he had sent it to her.</span></p><p><span style="">In terms of worth, these Items was worth millions. &#xA0;However, if one thought about the task they would have to accomplish in the future, it was a good investment for him.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;We&apos;ll start the training again.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;&#x2026;.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Haesol&apos;s special forces troop revved up their training.</span></p><p><span style="">*** </span></p><p><span style="">The promised 12 days had passed.</span></p><p><span style="">The portal to the Dimensional Domain Alandal was opened. &#xA0;The 23 Roused under the care of Haesol appeared. The look in their eyes and their auras were completely different than before.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;We&apos;ve finished our training.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Woojin listened to Haesol&apos;s report from his Throne. &#xA0;He once again purchased Reinforcement Stones from the Dimensional Store. &#xA0;Every time the absorption standby period ended, it was best to provide the Reinforcement Stones on time.</span></p><p><span style="">The development of abilities was important, but the advance of one&apos;s personal stats had a big influence on one&apos;s combat ability.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;You guys all did well.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">He looked indifferent, but he looked dignified. &#xA0;When Woojin took out the Reinforcement Stones as rewards for their training, the new recruits became stunned. &#xA0;This was very true for Kim-joonyong. &#xA0;It looked as if he was about to cry.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;What a benevolent person! &#xA0;He really is the king of our time..&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">He couldn&apos;t even be compared to his instructor Che-haesol. &#xA0;She was someone he didn&apos;t want to come across even in hell. &#xA0;Haesol&apos;s actions were all done for the training. &#xA0;However, Kim-joonyong had challenged her authority the most, so Kim-joonyong had been beaten the most by her.</span></p><p><span style="">He wasn&apos;t burning with a sense of revenge, but he couldn&apos;t think favorably of her.</span></p><p><span style="">He was mature enough to recognize the hierarchy of their poisitions. &#xA0;This was why he was keeping silent.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;You guys should eat it.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;We are worthless. &#xA0;Are you sure you should be giving these Items to us so freely?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Investment. &#xA0;It is an investment.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ah ah.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">As expected, he was magnanimous. &#xA0;He was the king of kings.</span></p><p><span style="">Joonyong was moved.</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin grinned.</span></p><p><span style="">If he killed them now, they would merely be corpses. &#xA0;At the very least, if he could raise them to the 7th Circle or Rank AA, he could recycle them into Death Knights....</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Haesol.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes, sir.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Well, do you have a name for your team?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I haven&apos;t thought about it.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Woojin looked at the newly recruited Roused.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Well, do any of you have a good idea for a team name?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Joonyong was the first one to pose a question at Woojin&apos;s words.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;We are always going to work as a single team?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Of course. &#xA0;Moreover, this team will be under Haesol&apos;s command..&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">At Woojin&apos;s words, everyone including Joonyong frowned.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Chet. &#xA0;I don&apos;t like it, but it is an order from our king.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">Woojin was deep within his thoughts as he started to tap on the Throne&apos;s armrest. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">Kim-joonyong raised his hand high into the air.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;How about Phantom?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Phantom?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;We want to become your elite guards, who will protect the king, even in our death as ghosts.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Woojin smirked.</span></p><p><span style="">Was he giving Woojin permission to take their souls if they died? &#xA0;Their souls would cease to exist&#x2026;. </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Well, all right. &#xA0;The name is cheesy, but it fits.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Woojin looked at Haesol, who was standing in front of her unit.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Let&apos;s call it the Phantom Unit. &#xA0;As their commander, you have the discretion to separate them into further teams.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Haesol&apos;s eyes shone.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I am willing to give my life for Alandal.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Why is everyone talking about serving me in death today?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;&#x2026;.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">If they died, he would have to waste his Control Points on them. &#xA0;It would be better if they worked for him in life.</span></p><p><span style="">At that moment, Baek-jungdo, Do-jaemin, Blanka and Melody appeared as they passed through the open portal.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ho-ooh. &#xA0;The end is finally here.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;You all did a good job.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">The tension they felt dissipated when they arrived at Alandal. &#xA0;They were patting each other on the back when they realized the new recruits were lined up in front of Woojin. &#xA0;Most of the new recruits were slightly acquainted with the other group.</span></p><p><span style="">When they were at death&apos;s door, the Wyvern raced towards the Holy Maiden for treatment. &#xA0;Several recruits expressed their thanks to her with their eyes.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;You guys should greet each other at a later time. &#xA0;Let&apos;s head back to earth.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Uh? I don&apos;t think Sunggoo hyung is here yet.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Do-jaemin looked around once again as he asked the question.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Sunggoo died.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Whaaaaaaaaa?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Do-jaemin and, of course, everyone else had a surprised expression on their faces.</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin smirked as he opened the portal connecting to the Seoul Station&apos;s 1st exit.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I&apos;m joking. &#xA0;Sunggoo will join us when he head towards Alphen. &#xA0;Let&apos;s head to earth.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Whew. &#xA0;I really thought he died by the hands of the Lich.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Jaenis continuously chased after Sunggoo. &#xA0;The Lich&#x2019;s power was overwhelming. &#xA0;Jaemin had really thought Sunggoo was dead. &#xA0;Do-jaemin let out a sigh of relief, and he followed after Woojin.</span></p><p><span style="">Kim-joonyong passed through the portal to arrive at the Seoul Station&apos;s 1st Exit. &#xA0;They were standing atop the soil of Seoul.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;This is structured like a high rank Dungeon.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">He was a Rank E Roused, so he had never experienced going into a high rank Dungeon. &#xA0;However, he knew about them. &#xA0;The Dimensional Domain Alandal was set up similarly to a high rank Dungeon. &#xA0;No, this was beyond being similar. &#xA0;This really was a high rank Dungeon.</span></p><p><span style="">Joonyong&apos;s eyes landed on Kahng-woojin&apos;s back.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;What&apos;s the identity of our king.&#x2026;.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">Every deed he did created a huge ripple across the world. &#xA0;His curiosity as to the real identity of Kahng-woojin was skyrocketing. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">There was a crowd of reporters that was several times larger than usual in front of them. &#xA0;They were continuosly taking pictures.</span></p><p><span style="">They walked between the parted crowd, and it felt as if they had come back from winning a war. &#xA0;It felt a little bit weird for Kim-joonyong, since this was a reception one would get in a return from a triumphant campaign.</span></p><p><span style="">He was merely a Rank E Roused.</span></p><p><span style="">He used to make rounds at the Mines, but now numerous people were giving him attention as a Roused of Alandal.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Uh?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">They walked down the road, and when they arrived at Alandal, there were people gathered at the front gate. &#xA0;Joonyong&apos;s eyes widened.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Aigo. &#xA0;Joonyong-ah!&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Mom?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">It wasn&apos;t only Joonyong&apos;s family. &#xA0;The family of all the newly recruited Roused was all gathered here. &#xA0;Their family had been waiting for their return.</span></p><p><span style="">The new employees didn&apos;t know what was going on, but Prime Minister Jung-minchan laughed as he spoke.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;You guys are now soldiers of Alandal. &#xA0;Of course, your family has the right to become citizens of Alandal.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ah&#x2026;.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Jung-minchan had invited the family of the newly recruited Roused, and he had taken care of almost everything regarding their family&apos;s daily needs. &#xA0;Moreover, the newly recruited Roused would be issued credit cards, private cars and even personal drivers. </span></p><p><span style="">They had spent 12 days on the Planet Jaku, but only 3 days had past on earth.</span></p><p><span style="">All this preparation had occurred in 3 days time.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Well done, sir.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Woojin grinned at Jung-minchan&apos;s words. &#xA0;He whispered into Minchan&apos;s ears.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Are they hostages?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hahaha. &#xA0;I merely wanted to protect the family members in the safest location possible.</span></p><p><span style="">Jung-minchan gave a wink. &#xA0;Woojin put on a satisfied smile.</span></p><p><span style="">As expected, Minchan was good at his job. &#xA0;It had been worthwhile to make Minchan the Prime Minister.</span></p>
