<p><strong>Chapter 82 Return (2).</strong></p><div id="chapterContent" class="innerContent fr-view"><p><span style="">Chapter 82 - Return (2)</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p><p><span style="">Woojin got off at the shoulder of the road, then he caught a taxi.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Where do you want to go?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Sadahng.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">After he spoke, Woojin sat still as he closed his eyes.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;From now on&#x2026;.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">First, he would go to his house to see his mother and Sooah, then he would return to the Dungeons. He had to reach level 70. Only then would he be able to calm himself.</span></p><p><span style="">Afterwards, he would find a Reset Dungeon and obtain the Dimensional Fragment. He would find the Dungeon that reacted to him and form his Dimensional Domain. Then, he would drill a single entrance into Alphen. Ah, before he does all of that, he had to train Sunggoo. Would he also have to pick a new Roused to groom?</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin was in a state of meditation as he organized the thoughts that kept crowding his mind. Soon, the taxi arrived at the destination, which was in front of his house.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;It&apos;ll be $25.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Huh-uh. That&apos;s quite high.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;It&apos;s a service I am doing with my life on the line.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin got what he was saying, but wasn&#x2019;t everyone working near a subway station and putting their life on the line? Woojin started searching his pockets and, as if he had just thought about this, had an expression of embarrassment on his face.</span></p><p><span style="">Come to think of it, all his possession were inside his trunk, and it was with Minchan.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I don&apos;t have my wallet.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">For a brief moment, the taxi driver&apos;s eyelids fluttered. He looked at Woojin with worried eyes. Woojin let out a cheerful laugh.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Huh huh. Don&apos;t worry about it. I&apos;ll ask someone to bring some money out.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Minchan always carried around money so Woojin would always just have only his phone around. He was quite fortunate that he had brought his hand phone.</span></p><p><span style="">He called his mother.</span></p><p><span style="">Ddoo-roo-roo-roo.</span></p><p><span style="">It kept ringing and she wasn&apos;t picking up the phone. The taxi driver gave him a wary look.</span></p><p><span style="">For no reason, Woojin felt startled and anxious. After a long while, his mother answered the phone. When Woojin heard his mother&apos;s voice, it was welcoming, like the much-needed rain in a drought.</span></p><p><span style="">[Uh, son. You are back in Korea?]</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes. I&apos;m in front of the house, but I don&apos;t have the taxi fare. Would you mind coming out for a little bit?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">[Huh? I&apos;m not at home right now.]</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;&#x2026;.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">He hadn&apos;t considered such a scenario. It was still daytime, so Sooah should be at her kindergarten. Moreover, his mother seemed to have gone out...</span></p><p><span style="">[I think there is money inside the house... Why don&apos;t you look through the dresser?]</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;No. It&apos;s all right. I&apos;ll just go to the office...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">He had planned on going to the office eventually after a brief break.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ahjuhshi. Turn the taxi around, then head towards the Sadahng station.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Why do you want to go there?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I can give you the money over there.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;&#x2026;.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">What was this? Is this some new way to rob a taxi?</span></p><p><span style="">The driver looked at Woojin with worry in his eyes. Woojin let out a laugh.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Do you know who I am, ahjuhshi?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;How would I know who you are?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Huh? People tell me I&apos;m famous now...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;&#x2026;.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The suspicion in the taxi driver&apos;s eyes increased significantly. Woojin scratched the back of his head. Well, it was an internet society now. If this guy didn&apos;t watch the TV or check the trending search words online, he wouldn&apos;t know about Woojin.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Let&apos;s just get there first. I&apos;ll call someone I know.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Koo-hmmm.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The taxi driver still looked at him with suspicion, but after he adjusted his rear-view mirror, he started his car. Woojin called Sunggoo&apos;s phone.</span></p><p><span style="">Ddo-roo-roo-roo-roo.</span></p><p><span style="">[Yes, president.]</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Uh? Is that Haemin? Why are you answering the phone?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">[Currently, director Hong is clearing the Dungeon, so I&apos;m here to assist him.]</span></p><p><span style="">Even though Woojin was absent, Sunggoo must have been busily clearing the Dungeons.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Where are you?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">[I&apos;m at the entrance of Hongdae.]</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Chet. You traveled pretty far. What&apos;s Soonghoon doing?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">[Mr. Soong-hoon went to the market to buy the Reinforcement Stones.]</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ughh. All right. I&apos;ll see you later at the office.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">[Yes. I&apos;ll immediately return to the office after director Hong finishes clearing the Dungeon.]</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;All right.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">How could he be put in such an awkward situation just because of a couple dozen dollar bills?</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin tried calling Jiwon.</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin ended the call, then he pressed his hand firmly against his temple.</span></p><p><span style="">So what if he had tens of millions in his account? He didn&apos;t have any money he could use right now. Woojin looked through his meager address book and he automatically smiled when he saw the name.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;It&apos;s been a long time since I&apos;ve seen his face.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin pressed the [Real Jaemin] entry in his address book.</span></p><p><span style="">*</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;After reading the question, please find the value that doesn&apos;t fit.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">Jaemin was focused on reading his workbook when the vibration made his head turn to the side. The hand phone he had placed on the corner of his desk was vibrating.</span></p><p><span style="">Woooooong.</span></p><p><span style="">Jaemin&apos;s concentration was broken. He frowned as he looked at the number on the screen.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Uh? It&apos;s Woojin-hyung.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">It had been awhile since Woojin had contacted him. He was pleased as he quickly picked up the call.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hyung.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">[Uh. Hey, Jaemin. Are you at your house?]</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Uh? How did you know?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">It was the day before his CSAT, so Jaemin had come home early.</span></p><p><span style="">[Oh, that &apos;s great.]</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin had been guessing... Before Jaemin could ask how he was doing&#x2026;</span></p><p><span style="">[I&apos;m at the convenience store located at the intersection. Bring $50 with you.]</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2026;Woojin preemptively asked for a favor.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Fifty dollars?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">[Uh. Just come out for a moment, and bring the money. I don&apos;t have any money for the taxi fare.]</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;&#x2026;.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Why did this hyung never change?</span></p><p><span style="">He constantly came out on the news when he did something, and he was always the trending search word on the internet... He was a millionaire, who had traveled back and forth from the US on a private plane. So why was he trying to extort money from Jaemin once again?</span></p><p><span style="">[Hey, hey. I&apos;ll pay you back. Do you think I don&apos;t have the money?]</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;&#x2026;.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">If he had money, then why was he asking Jaemin to bring money?</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;If you have money then you should pay the taxi fee with it...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">[I have money, but I don&apos;t have the taxi fee.]</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;&#x2026;.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">He didn&apos;t know if he was speaking or if he was farting. (TLN: idiom)</span></p><p><span style="">[Ah, I&apos;ll pay you back later. Just hurry up and bring it.]</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;Okay.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">[Oh. Jaemin is really the only one I can trust.]</span></p><p><span style="">This hyung never changes.</span></p><p><span style="">Jaemin closed the workbook he was working on and put on his outerwear. Jiwon, who was coming out from the restroom after a shower, looked at Jaemin with round eyes when he started heading out.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I thought you were going to go through your mock test for the last time. Where are you going?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Woojin hyung wants to borrow some money for the taxi fare.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Huh?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I&apos;ll be back soon.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hey. You will catch a cold. Your exam is tomorrow, so where do you think you&#x2019;re going? I can go instead. I&apos;ve already been planning on going out tonight.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;It&apos;s all right. It seems that he&#x2019;s in a hurry. Just go dry your hair.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">He&#x2019;d be out for only a brief moment so he wouldn&#x2019;t catch a cold. His sister just took a shower and she hadn&#x2019;t dried her hair yet. She was more likely to catch a cold than him. The November weather was chilly, and it was on the verge of coldness.</span></p><p><span style="">After coming outside, Woojin put his hands into his pockets and started to trot. There was a taxi parked in front of the convenience store he frequented. Jaemin approached the back window and knocked.</span></p><p><span style="">Jeeeeeng.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Uh, are you here? Where&apos;s the money?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Here.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Wooin took the $50 from Jaemin and handed it over to the driver.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ahjushi, wasn&apos;t I right. I told you I wasn&apos;t lying.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Huh huh. Jeez.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">By listening to the conversation between the taxi driver and Woojin, there seemed to be some disagreement between the two of them. Woojin took the change and immediately gave it to Jaemin.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I&apos;ll give you the rest later.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">What kind of person... no, this hyung was alway like this.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;All right.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Why are you so down?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I&apos;m taking the CSAT tomorrow.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Oh! Even I didn&apos;t do well on the CSAT.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin looked at Jaemin with wonder in his face. Jaemin looked back with a ridiculous expression on his face.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What&apos;s your sister doing?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;She was getting ready to head out.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Where?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I have no idea. Try calling her. She was taking a shower not too long ago, so that&apos;s probably why she couldn&apos;t take your call.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Is that so?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I&apos;ll be heading in now. I have to monitor my condition.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Uh, all right&#x2026; &#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">When Woojin saw the worn out Jaemin, Woojin stopped him for a brief moment.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hey. Drink this and go.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin held up a mysterious blue bottle.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Say ahhh.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I&apos;ll drink it at home.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I have to feed it to you. Just say ahhh.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Jaemin opened his mouth with a leery expression on his face. Woojin personally poured the liquid into his mouth.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ook. It&apos;s pretty tasty. What is it?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;It&apos;s a medicine that&apos;ll clear your head. It&apos;ll help you a lot in your studies.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I...I think I feel it working?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">He felt a clear and cool feeling as if he had just chewed on a mint candy. He turned his head in confusion when his headache disappeared, and his head felt lighter.</span></p><p><span style="">He wouldn&apos;t feel this immediate effect even if he drank coffee and Bacchus. (TLN: korean energy drink)</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Thank you, hyung.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Haha, alright. Do well on the exam tomorrow. If I have some free time, then I&apos;ll go cheer for you.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Okay.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">After sending Jaemin back, he called Jiwon.</span></p><p><span style="">[Hey, Woojin. I was about to head out to meet you when I heard you were here.]</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ah. Is that so?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">It seemed she didn&apos;t have any other business. She had been getting ready to come out and meet him. He planned on resting until his guild family gathered at the office. He decided to spend the time by going on a date with Jiwon.</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin entered the coffee shop then he sat down.</span></p><p><span style="">He didn&apos;t have any money, so he couldn&apos;t order anything. He was a regular customer, so the employees of the cafe didn&apos;t say anything to him. Instead, the surrounding customer started noticing who he was. They were amazed, but they didn&apos;t approach him. His bad temper was well known now, and he had an unapproachable aura around him. No one was brave enough to approach him.</span></p><p><span style="">They kept glancing at him as if he was a monkey inside a zoo.</span></p><p><span style="">Ddal-lahng.</span></p><p><span style="">When Jiwon appeared through the cafe&#x2019;s door, people let out exclamations.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Ooh-wahh. That person must be Do-jiwon.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Kahng-woojin&apos;s girlfriend? She&apos;s really pretty.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">She was like an entertainer&#x2026; No, Do-jiwon was more famous than most entertainers now. She had become famous after she was rumoured to be Kahng-woojin&apos;s woman on the internet. Her appearance only enhanced her popularity.</span></p><p><span style="">As a part time job, she did a photo shoot for a shopping centre&#x2019;s ad. This prompted people to make a fansite for her.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Heh heh. Did you wait long? Did you order some coffee?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;No. I don&apos;t have any money.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Oh yeah. You said you don&apos;t have your wallet. What do you want to drink? I&apos;ve made some money, so I&apos;ll buy.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Jiwon ordered two cups of coffee. The two of them sat in front of each other, and they stared at each other&apos;s face. It had been exactly one month since he went to the US.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;It&apos;s been a while. Right?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I guess so. What did you do while I was gone?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Me? Oh this and that. Hoo hoo. I&apos;ve received a lot of calls from the entertainment agencies asking me to become an entertainer.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin laughed when she spoke, as if she was boasting.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;You want to be an entertainer?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;No. Heh heh. It&apos;s just pretty amazing. I still find it amazing that I can be in a crowded place without feeling fear.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">She had pretty much shrank away from how she lived her life before. Woojin shrugged his shoulders.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Why don&apos;t you try becoming an entertainer? Did any good agencies contact you?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;They did. All of them called. However, the call I&apos;ve been waiting for hasn&apos;t come yet.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;From where?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I&apos;m not talking about an entertainment agency, but the publishing company..&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ah ah.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">He thought she was joking when she had said she wanted to write a romance novel. It seemed she was serious. By looking at her reaction, it seemed she was quite passionate about it.</span></p><p><span style="">She suddenly let out a sigh.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Uh whew. Maybe I&apos;m not talented enough? The response from my readers aren&apos;t good either.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Huh? What do they say?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I get cussed out for the story being highly improbable.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Improbable?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;They say the story doesn&apos;t make any sense&#x2026;.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What&apos;s it about?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;You know. The story is about&#x2026;.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Jiwon&apos;s eyes twinkled and she gave a rough outline of her novel.</span></p><p><span style="">A high school student was summoned to a different world, and he grew into a dominant master in that world. After he became a power in that world, he returned to earth. The main character returned to save the woman he had loved in the past as she was being attacked by a monster.</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin tilted his head in confusion when he heard the story.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Isn&apos;t this about me?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes. I wrote it as I was thinking about you...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">As if she was embarrassed, Jiwon&apos;s cheeks reddened.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;It&apos;s very close to the truth, so how can they say it is improbable??&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Jiwon hesitated for a moment, then she spoke in a small voice.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;They said Ee-goggaengi&apos;s personality is too off on the deep ends....&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Huh? Ee-goggaeng?&#x201D; (TLN: slang for those teens who get sent to other worlds)</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ah, that basically means high school student from a different world...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">After hearing her explanation, Woojin&apos;s eyebrows furrowed.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I don&apos;t get it. What doesn&apos;t make any sense?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Right?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Jiwon nodded her head vigorously. How could it not make any sense? It was a story she wrote based on an actual individual.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;If a Ee-goggaengi comes back home, he is still a Ee-goggaengi. Do they think he&apos;ll mature and come back as an adult?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;R...right? That&apos;s what I was trying to go for.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Moreover, the guy lived the life of a villain over there, so wouldn&apos;t it be more strange if he started acting like a hero?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Right? You thinks so too.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin spoke as Jiwon agreed enthusiastically with him.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I want to read what you wrote.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Huh? It&apos;s a little bit e... embarassing.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Jiwon hesitated before she put in the address where she had uploaded her novel into his hand phone.</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin was impressed as he read her writing.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Isn&apos;t this me?&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">The main character&apos;s personality was almost a carbon copy of Woojin&apos;s personality. When he reached the end of the novel, he could see the massive amount of creative insults directed towards the author.</span></p><p><span style="">It felt as if he was getting insulted, so Woojin frowned.</span></p><p><span style="">Amongst the creative and abusive comments, he highlighted a comment he didn&apos;t know what it meant.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What is he trying to say?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Where?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Jiwon looked at her hand phone.</span></p><p><span style="">[Spotted Dog] - I&apos;m getting off at this chapter.</span></p><p><span style="">Jiwon let out an awkward laugh.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;This means&#x2026;.&#x201D;</span></p><p></p></div><p></p>
