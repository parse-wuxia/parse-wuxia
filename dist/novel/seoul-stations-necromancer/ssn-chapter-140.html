<p><span style="">Chapter 140 - Lord of Pestilence (3) </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I see you are really dedicated to your studies.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;No, I&apos;m not asking, because of that....&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Stop trying to rush me too much. He&apos;ll be coming out sometime today.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;No. &#xA0;I&apos;m not trying to rush you&#x2026;.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Sunggoo had wanted to ask if the Lich was needed in solving this current situation.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I&apos;ll make a guarantee.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Ah. Sunggoo felt uneasy.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;You just have to survive.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Woojin put his hand on Sunggoo&apos;s shoulder.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Then you will become the best Flame magician.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hyung-nim&#x2026;.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">He didn&apos;t get why his life be threatened just from learning magic....</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Go rest a little bit more.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;&#x2026;.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Woojin strode towards the hiccuping Holy Maiden. As if she was guilty of something, the Holy Maiden flinched in surprise. &#xA0;She didn&apos;t know what to do with herself.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Were you just reciting my history?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I...I&apos;ve committed a grave sin!&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">The Holy Maiden fell to her knees, and she bowed her head. Woojin reacted by putting on a sour expression.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;unless you really want to die, why don&apos;t you get up?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">She was a priestess, who was chosen to serve her goddess. &#xA0;She was the Holy Maiden yet she kept bowing to him. &#xA0;When the Holy Maiden tried to keep proper decorum towards him by bowing to him, it felt as if he was being treated the same as a god. &#xA0;He didn&apos;t like it.</span></p><p><span style="">He was human.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">The Holy Maiden abruptly got up. &#xA0;Woojin frowned as he asked her a question. He didn&apos;t care if she was talking about him from behind his back. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">He was more interested in Alphen&apos;s history.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;The first Dungeon was linked to Alphen around 200 years ago?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes. &#xA0;You are correct.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;When did the Dimensional lords start to indiscriminately invade Alphen?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;It was around 100 years ago.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;&#x2026;.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Woojin made some mental calculations about the timeline, and he frowned.</span></p><p><span style="">The first Dungeon formed 5 years ago on earth. &#xA0;The Dimensional lords started to show up after 5 years. It was progressing too fast.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;So Alphen held out for 100 years? &#xA0;How long do you think earth will be able to hold out?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;The Dungeons of Alphen and earth can&apos;t be compared. &#xA0;So asking for a prediction is a bit...&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Mmmm&#x2026;.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Earth&apos;s communication network was much superior.</span></p><p><span style="">If something happened on the planet, the whole world would know about it the next day. &#xA0;That was how advanced the communication network on earth was.</span></p><p><span style="">However, people of earth weren&apos;t fighting as one. They were having trouble unifying.</span></p><p><span style="">Information traveled slower on Alphen, but there had been figures, who had been able to coordinate and control the people. &#xA0;These beings were able to lead the hearts of men. &#xA0;They were able to rally the people towards a specific direction.</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin looked towards Melody, who was the Holy Maiden of the Aria Church.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I have a task for you.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What is it?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I want you to help Sooah awaken.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;&#x2026;.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">His words surprised Melody. &#xA0;She looked up at Woojin with rabbit eyes.</span></p><p><span style="">It wasn&apos;t a simple task to relay the words of a god. &#xA0;Melody had personal experience regarding this, so she was more informed than anyone else.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Are you sure about this?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Well, I have no choice.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">He didn&apos;t have much choice. &#xA0;This was for his dongsaeng and earth.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;We need a glue to hold &#xA0;us all together.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;&#x2026;.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Melody silently agreed with Woojin&apos;s words.</span></p><p><span style="">He had tried to become the essential glue that held all the people together. &#xA0;He had tried to use his overwhelming power and overbearing actions to lead the people. &#xA0;However, the world was crumbling faster around him.</span></p><p><span style="">Earth would fall from within &#xA0;before Woojin could gain control over the Roused.</span></p><p><span style="">Morality would crumble. Hopelessness and despair would spread across the world. &#xA0;He needed to give the people hope and trust.</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin had been found lacking.</span></p><p><span style="">His dongsaeng was a God&apos;s Seed.</span></p><p><span style="">He didn&apos;t know which god would appear.</span></p><p><span style="">It might be one of the god, whom people worshipped for a long time. &#xA0;It could also be a forgotten ancient god, who no one could identify....</span></p><p><span style="">She could be chosen by some unknown god. &#xA0;Sooah&apos;s fate would be harsh, but she didn&apos;t have a choice. &#xA0;Woojin couldn&apos;t do anything for her.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Sooah has to survive.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">The God&apos;s Seed couldn&apos;t be denied unless one died.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What if it is an evil god?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Pfft.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Woojin laughed in spite of himself.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;You think gods are divided by good and evil?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;&#x2026;.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;If you believe them then they are good. &#xA0;If not, they are evil.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;&#x2026;.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">As the Holy Maiden of Aria, she didn&apos;t want to hear such words from the Immortal. &#xA0;However, she didn&apos;t have the courage to dispute his claim.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;There is no such thing as an evil god. &#xA0;Go help Sooah awaken.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">She could help the God&apos;s Seed sprout without Sooah going insane.</span></p><p><span style="">The Holy Maiden Melody possessed the power of Aria, so this was something only she could do.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Understood.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">When he heard the Holy Maiden&apos;s reply, Woojin turned to look at the rampaging monsters.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Well, shall I go hunt a dragon?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Woojin grinned as he looked at the Gold Dragon perched atop Namsan.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I&apos;ll help you.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Woojin shook his head when Sunggoo stood up immediately.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Haesol and you can clear the monsters near here.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Understood.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">It was unfortunate, but Woojin had made the call. &#xA0;It meant this was too dangerous for him. &#xA0;Sunggoo didn&apos;t overextend himself for no reason. Roused worked with their life on the line, and nothing was more dangerous than reckless bravado.</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin was going to catch one Dragon. &#xA0;It wasn&apos;t a big deal, so he didn&apos;t need to take all of his companions.</span></p><p><span style="">He needed 10 Death Knights to distract the Dragon. &#xA0;Dolsae would steadily attack, and Bibi will use her mental attacks to cause confusion. &#xA0;He would also be attacking. &#xA0;He didn&apos;t need anyone else.</span></p><p><span style="">However, the monsters had spread out far with Nasan as the staging point. &#xA0;His familiars had to cover a large region, so they were all busy.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Or I could just call on Jaenis.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">His EXP was surging towards the end.</span></p><p><span style="">He just needed couple minutes, and his EXP would be filled. </span></p><p><span style="">Potential EXP was all around him. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">He was actually delighted that the Dungeon Breaks were concentrated around Seoul. &#xA0;His Undead army was able to hunt down the monsters, and his EXP was stacking at a very fast rate.</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin ran into the battlefield himself. &#xA0;He wanted to shorten the time it took for him to level up.</span></p><p><span style="">Shwahhhk! </span></p><p><span style="">Woojin extended his hand, and the Bone Spears pierced through the monsters like they were made out of cloth.</span></p><p><span style="">Ooh-ooh-oong! </span></p><p><span style="">The Spirit Spears shot down the swift bat monsters from the sky. The bat monsters kept dodging, but the Spirit Spears chased them down.</span></p><p><span style="">Kwah-jeek! </span></p><p><span style="">After gaining the Warrior Class, his most frequently used weapon was the axe. &#xA0;His axe split open the heads of the monsters. He didn&apos;t have to work too hard to end the lives of the monsters.</span></p><p><span style="">Each engagement resulted in corpses stacking up around Woojin. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">Were the monsters sick of his overwhelming force?</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin grinned when he saw the monsters showing signs of retreating.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Where do you think you are going?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Chwa-roo-rook! </span></p><p><span style="">There were numerous corpses here. &#xA0;There were a lot of corpses with bones within them.</span></p><p><span style="">He could use the corpses as medium to form the Wall of Bones. &#xA0;Woojin blocked the retreat of the monsters, and Woojin&apos;s power exploded forth.</span></p><p><span style="">Poo-hwah-hahk! </span></p><p><span style="">With Woojin at the center, a green smoke started to spread outwards, and it started to poison the monsters. &#xA0;The Insect type monsters all died from the poison. &#xA0;He didn&apos;t even have to raise his Weapon.</span></p><p><span style="">If he didn&apos;t have to worry about his allies, Woojin&apos;s battle style was peerless. &#xA0;This battle style had been passed on to Hong-sunggoo.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Rise!&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Poo-hwhak! </span></p><p><span style="">The corpses around Woojin exploded. &#xA0;Blood and body parts flew everywhere, and over 200 Skeleton Mages were summoned. Each of their levels were high enough to be close in ability to a Rank B Roused.</span></p><p><span style="">Each of their magic spells were dangerous. &#xA0;The only shortcoming was the fact that their magic were simple. They could only use magic of a single element. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">They could only use a single magic spell, but this didn&#x2019;t mean there weren&#x2019;t a variety of magic being used. &#xA0;This was the case when several dozen to several hundred of them were summoned. &#xA0;He summoned Skeleton Magicians able to use Fire, Ice, Lightning, Wind or Poison type magic. &#xA0;He was able to create a diverse mage army. </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Bomb them!&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Kee-keek. </span></p><p><span style="">The Skeletons let out a hair-raising laugh, and they started to let loose their magic. The Death Knights had some room to breathe thanks to Woojin&apos;s active role in the battle. &#xA0;The Death Knights moved the Skeleton army to surround the monsters. &#xA0;They created a large perimeter around Namsan.</span></p><p><span style="">99.9% </span></p><p><span style="">He was almost there. &#xA0;However, at that moment, the Dragon pushed off the Namsan tower to head towards Woojin. &#xA0;It seemed the Dragon realized he couldn&apos;t just let this be. &#xA0;When the Dragon left the Namsan tower, one could see vines encircling the entire tower.</span></p><p><span style="">It seemed the Dragon was trying to make the Namsan tower his colony.</span></p><p><span style="">It still need a day to become functional. &#xA0;Woojin had plenty of time to kill the dragon then destroy the colony.</span></p><p><span style="">The Dragon was high up in the sky, and its stomach was inflating.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;This might be a problem.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Will he be able to block the Dragon&apos;s Breath?</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin would be fine. &#xA0;His Spirit Armor would protect him. &#xA0;However, the people around him.... &#xA0;What will he do about the people in Alandal?</span></p><p><span style="">&lt;Level Up!&gt; </span></p><p><span style="">This was a very welcome sound. &#xA0;Woojin immediately called for him.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Jaenis.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">It was his teacher, who had taught him the ways of slaughter and boldness.</span></p><p><span style="">He had helped Woojin with creating destruction. &#xA0;He was Woojin&apos;s top advisor, who had helped him reign.</span></p><p><span style="">He had once been called a great scholar and an Archmage on Alphen.</span></p><p><span style="">To save Alphen from crumbling, he had made himself a Lich, and he had been taken captive by madness.</span></p><p><span style="">The Deathless Magician.</span></p><p><span style="">Shwahkkk! </span></p><p><span style="">The black smoke coalesced in midair. &#xA0;He was a Skeleton wearing a black robe, and he had a black staff in his hand. &#xA0;He wore similar looking clothes as the Skeleton Mage, but unlike the Skeleton mages, he had an oppressive presence.</span></p><p><span style="">His red eyes flashed.</span></p><p><span style="">[Master! Was Alphen saved?] </span></p><p><span style="">His voice buzzed, and the sound had the power of shaking a person&apos;s heart. &#xA0;The hair raising sound was akin to a train coming to an emergency stop.</span></p><p><span style="">Woojin touched his itchy ears as he spoke.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Not yet. &#xA0;How about blocking that for me first?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Woojin pointed to the sky. &#xA0;The Golden Dragon Rajakui had inflated to a massive size, and it was about to let out its Dragon&apos;s Breath.</span></p><p><span style="">[Where did my power disappear to?] </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Oh yeah.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Woojin quickly opened his Skill Window, and he invested Bonus Points into the &apos;Lich Summon&apos; skill. In a flash, the 1 became 99. Jaenis body flashed several times, and his body went through several changes.</span></p><p><span style="">The black robe was now imprinted with glowing magical circles, and it was letting out a mysterious atmosphere. &#xA0;The head of the staff was embedded with 5 types of gems, and it was letting out a dazzling light.</span></p><p><span style="">Pooh-ah-ah-ah! </span></p><p><span style="">It sounded as if a pressure cooker was being opened. &#xA0;If one listened with one&apos;s eyes closed that was what it sounded like.</span></p><p><span style="">The source of the sound was the Dragon&apos;s Breath that had been emitted from Rajakui&apos;s mouth. &#xA0;It was heading towards the surface. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">Jaenis created a concave shield to block out the entire sky.</span></p><p><span style="">Kwah-kwah-kwahng.</span></p><p><span style="">It was a barrier made out of magic, and it pressed up against the Dragon&apos;s barrier. &#xA0;A shockwave exploded forth as if a nuclear bomb had gone off. &#xA0;However, most of it was reflected towards the sky. &#xA0;The damage on the ground was minimal.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;You were right on time.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">[Does Yong Yong need a friend?] </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;He&apos;s Trahnet&apos;s minion. &#xA0;He&apos;s useless to me. Just kill him.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">When a Dimensional lord was killed, the corpse wasn&apos;t left behind. &#xA0;It would just disappear as it let out a gray light. &#xA0;Wouldn&apos;t one need the corpse to make a Bone Dragon?</span></p><p><span style="">[What about &#x2018;Thrash&apos;s Executioner&#x2019;?] </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I searched for it, but I couldn&apos;t find it.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">He had searched through the Achievement Store and the Dimensional Store, but the Executioner was missing. Amongst Thrash&apos;s set item, the Executioner was the weapon. &#xA0;The recipe was also missing, so he had no idea if it really existed or not. It was an odd weapon.</span></p><p><span style="">Jaenis continued to tell Woojin that he had to continue his search for the weapon.</span></p><p><span style="">While the two were having a conversation, the Dragon slowly descended.</span></p><p><span style="">Rajakui glared at the Undead Magician, who had blocked its Dragon&apos;s Breath. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">He never expected to find such a strong Lich on earth.</span></p><p><span style="">[The earth isn&apos;t synchronized yet. &#xA0;How were you able to gain such power as a Roused from earth?] </span></p><p><span style="">Rajakui&apos;s words made Lich&apos;s red eyes gleam.</span></p><p><span style="">[Disgusting!] </span></p><p><span style="">Jaenis&apos; anger toward Trahnet exceeded one&apos;s imagination. </span></p><p><span style="">Woojin shrugged his shoulders.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;We&apos;ll talk after you kill that thing.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">[As the lord commands!] </span></p><p><span style="">The Lich was willful as he switched between using master and lord.</span></p><p><span style="">It couldn&apos;t be helped. &#xA0;Woojin hadn&apos;t made this being. &#xA0;The Lich had existed on its own for 200 years before he had become Woojin&apos;s familiar. &#xA0;Woojin was just thankful and reassured by the fact that Jaenis followed his order.</span></p><p><span style="">[Burn to death by the Inferno!] </span></p><p><span style="">Hwah-roo-roo-roohk! </span></p><p><span style="">A black fire shot out from Jaenis&apos; staff, and it impacted on Rajakui&apos;s wing. &#xA0;This was a fire comparable to the flames within hell. &#xA0;It was a type of hellfire, and Jaenis&apos; lightning quick casting time was almost unbelievable.</span></p><p><span style="">[Koo-oohk?] </span></p><p><span style="">Hwah-roo-roohk. </span></p><p><span style="">Its wing caught on fire, and its summoned magic couldn&apos;t put out the fire. The fire was spreading across its entire body.</span></p><p><span style="">Hoo-ooh-oohg, hoo-ooh-oohg! </span></p><p><span style="">The Dragon&apos;s wings was beating hard enough to send the cars flying across the street. &#xA0;The windows were ripped off the buildings, and the Skeleton Magicians were sent flying every which way. &#xA0;. </span></p><p><span style="">Koo-ah-ahng! </span></p><p><span style="">The Dragon desperately flapped its wings in the air before it crashed to the ground. &#xA0;After flattening several buildings, the Dragon finally came to a stop.</span></p><p><span style="">It had barely been able to extinguish the hell&apos;s conflagration.</span></p><p><span style="">If it hadn&apos;t been a dragon... &#xA0;It would have burned until its life was extinguished.</span></p><p><span style="">[How dare you! You dare enrage me!] </span></p><p><span style="">It had linked to earth with a light heart, and it never expected to suffer such a humiliation.</span></p><p><span style="">[This parlor trick won&apos;t be able to withstand my rage!] </span></p><p><span style="">It was caught off guard, so the hell fire had easily struck it. &#xA0;It was serious now, so it wouldn&apos;t fall for the hell fire again.</span></p><p><span style="">It was going to destroy the entire city.</span></p><p><span style="">Koo-uh-uh-uh! </span></p><p><span style="">The Dragon&apos;s wings smoked as it let out a roar. &#xA0;It stood on all four legs. &#xA0;The dreadful Fear made all beings shake from terror.</span></p><p><span style="">The Lich didn&apos;t have ears, so he didn&apos;t budge an inch. &#xA0;He just stood there in front of the Dragon.</span></p><p><span style="">[Goo-ha-ha. &#xA0;Was I lacking in firepower?] </span></p><p><span style="">Magic extended out from the Lich&apos;s Staff.</span></p><p><span style="">Hwah-roo-roohk. </span></p><p><span style="">From the Dragon&apos;s surrounding, fountain of flames rose up. &#xA0;Flames had pierced up from the ground, and the flames were blossoming into a flower. Heads appeared from the red hot lava.</span></p><p><span style="">These were Dragons with 9 heads, who had fallen into the fires of hell to be tortured.</span></p><p><span style="">The Hydra had been summoned by Jaenis.</span></p><p><span style="">Kwahkhhhh! </span></p><p><span style="">To be precise, he had summoned 100 of them. </span></p><p><span style="">Nine hundred heads opened its jaws, and they headed towards Rajakui.</span></p>
