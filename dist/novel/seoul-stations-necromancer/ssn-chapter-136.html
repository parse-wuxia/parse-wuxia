<p><span style="">Chapter 136 - Blood Golem</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Why is there so many of them?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Woojin frowned as he looked at the monsters gathering to form a horde.</span></p><p><span style="">These bastards acted the same way as the monsters on Alphen. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">They&#x2019;ll occupy a region, and they&apos;ll start establishing a colony. &#xA0;Then they&apos;ll start drinking the Earth&apos;s energy....</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Shit. &#xA0;Mivich that bastard.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">He had wasted too much time fighting that bastard. &#xA0;If it was only the lost time he had to worry about, he would have been fortunate. &#xA0;However, he had lost 10 Death Knights in the fight.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;The Innate Domain Skills are a pain.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">In the Clear mode, one is attempting to fight a lord with the rank of an Adventurer. &#xA0;There was a lot of advantage in a lord being able to use one&#x2019;s Innate Domain Skills. </span></p><p><span style="">If he met Mivich on earth or Alphen, two Death Knights would have been enough to take him down. &#xA0;However, he had shown a terrible amount of power inside his Domain, and he had taken 10 Death Knights with him.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Where should I clean up first?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">There were 7 locations where the monsters were gathering around Seoul. &#xA0;It was probably seven Dimensional lords settling in and constructing a colony.</span></p><p><span style="">It would be troublesome if those bastards set up bases, so he had to get rid of them as soon as possible.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;That bastard didn&apos;t even leave a cellphone before he left.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Before he entered the Dungeon, he had given his handphone to Soonghoon for safekeeping. &#xA0;The support team that should have been waiting for him had gone off to somewhere after leaving behind a memo....</span></p><p><span style="">Fortunately, Woojin had an additional method of communication besides the cellphone.</span></p><p><span style="">[Where are you?] </span></p><p><span style="">Woojin could exchange messages with the vassals of his Domain using his Will. &#xA0;As a substitute for his Dimensional Battles, he had made Do-jaemin his strategic adviser.</span></p><p><span style="">[W...what the hell is this?] </span></p><p><span style="">[I said where are you?] </span></p><p><span style="">[Huhk. Now that I&apos;m about to die I must be hallucinating.] </span></p><p><span style="">[It&apos;s hyung.] </span></p><p><span style="">[&#x2026;&#x2026;.] </span></p><p><span style="">After a brief moment, Jaemin&apos;s Will gushed out.</span></p><p><span style="">[Hyung! It&apos;s a mess right now. &#xA0;I&apos;m trapped inside a broadcasting station.] </span></p><p><span style="">[Broadcasting station? &#xA0;You aren&apos;t at the office? &#xA0;Why did you go there?] </span></p><p><span style="">[I left the office when noonah left. &#xA0;I&apos;m currently at MBS.] </span></p><p><span style="">Woojin&apos;s brows furrowed. &#xA0;He remembered Do-jiwon had gone to the reunion.</span></p><p><span style="">[Where did your sister go?] </span></p><p><span style="">[What? She went to the BB Hotel.....] </span></p><p><span style="">Woojin&apos;s face hardened when he checked the memo. &#xA0;BB Hotel was one of the 7 locations listed.</span></p><p><span style="">[Be sure to stay out of sight. &#xA0;I&apos;ll send Dolsae.] </span></p><p><span style="">[Yes&#x2026;.] </span></p><p><span style="">He had 10 Death Knights he couldn&apos;t summon, since they were destroyed. &#xA0;He had to wait for their revival.</span></p><p><span style="">There were 44 Death Knights available for Woojin&apos;s use.</span></p><p><span style="">He still had his Protection Period left for his Dimension, so he decided to leave his latest Death Knight behind to defend against a surprise Dungeon raid attempt. &#xA0;He left behind Relick, who had been a warrior of the Ratick race. </span></p><p><span style="">He summoned 43 Death Knights alongside Dolsae and Bibi.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Come out Dolsae and Bibi.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ooh-wahng. &#xA0;It&apos;s earth.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">It had been awhile since she was summoned to earth. &#xA0;Bibi had a large smile on her face. &#xA0;If one thought about the Skeleton Warriors assigned to each Death Knight, Woojin had a staggering amount of force.</span></p><p><span style="">He&apos;ll decided to divide his Undead Army to clear the seven locations at the same time.</span></p><p><span style="">One needed at least 10 Death Knights to safely go up against a Dimensional Lord.</span></p><p><span style="">He divided 40 Death Knights into 4 teams.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;You go here, and you go there.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">[As the King commands!] </span></p><p><span style="">Woojn turned to look at Bibi and Dolsae.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;You guys go to MBS. &#xA0;You guys save Jaemin, and kill all the enemies nearby.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hehe. &#xA0;All right. This is going to be fun!&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Bibi took out a staff, and she flew away with Dolsae following her.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;You go to Alandal, Kiba. &#xA0;Don&apos;t get into a fight with the Holy Maiden.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">[&#x2026;as you command.] </span></p><p><span style="">He sounded offended, and his reaction was lukewarm. &#xA0;However, he would never disobey an order. &#xA0;Woojin didn&apos;t know where Sunggoo and Haesol was right now, but he didn&apos;t worry too much about Alandal, since Melody was there.</span></p><p><span style="">When all of his familiars left, the thought of Mivich suddenly came unbidden to his mind.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;That damn bastard. &#xA0;I&apos;ll kill him the next time I meet him.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">He had already killed Mivich, but Woojin promised to kill him once again.</span></p><p><span style="">He had unnecessarily lost a lot of Death Knights. &#xA0;Moreover, the bastard hadn&apos;t been worth a lot of EXP. &#xA0;This was why Woojin hadn&apos;t reached level 80 yet. &#xA0;He had lost a lot of his hunting time, and the loss had been massive.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;If only I had Jaenis in this situation....&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">If he had his teacher, Lich Jaenis, these Dimensional lords wouldn&apos;t even be a problem.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Shall I go now?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Finally, Woojin summoned his last familiar, then he got on.</span></p><p><span style="">Heeeeeeng! </span></p><p><span style="">Shin Shing raced across the road. &#xA0;Shing Shing abandoned the road destroyed by the monsters, and it jumped into the sky.</span></p><p><span style="">*** </span></p><p><span style="">Second Floor of the MBS Broadcasting Station.</span></p><p><span style="">There were 17 people hiding behind the stacked inventories.</span></p><p><span style="">Do-jaemin was holding tightly onto Lee-soolgi&apos;s hand. </span></p><p><span style="">Was his determination to protect her at all cost conveyed to her? &#xA0;Somehow she wasn&apos;t afraid in her current situation.</span></p><p><span style="">The boy she liked had turned into a Roused, and he had shown up in front of her. &#xA0;Moreover, he had done so when she was in danger.</span></p><p><span style="">How romantic and wonderful was his gesture?</span></p><p><span style="">However, the other idols felt differently.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I thought we were heading out. &#xA0;Why did you stop?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Joonsung was in the same group as Tony, and he was in an agitated state.</span></p><p><span style="">The Roused had come to save them, and he had great success in dispatching the monsters. &#xA0;However, the Roused suddenly stopped, and he instructed everyone to hide. &#xA0;They wanted to get out of the broadcasting station as soon as possible. The fact that they had to hide like this made the people frustrated and agitated.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Jaemin is hurt.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Jaemin had protected the people as he fought the monsters alone. &#xA0;It looked as if Do-jaemin wasn&apos;t in a good state. &#xA0;There was a deep claw mark on his shoulder, and he had to wrap a shirt around his abdomen after it had been punctured.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Fuck. &#xA0;Of course, he&apos;s hurt. Still, he is a Roused.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What did you just say? Aren&apos;t your words a bit too callous!&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Huh. Aren&#x2019;t you a rookie! &#xA0;What group are you from? How dare you talk that way to a senior....&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Joonsung glared at Soolgi. &#xA0;Soolgi was known for her temper, since her high school days. &#xA0;She was about to let loose when Do-jaemin held her back.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I&apos;m all right, Soolgi.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Jaemin&#x2026;.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ha-ah.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Jaemin&apos;s face was devoid of any color. &#xA0;He had been almost at his limit when he received a message from Woojin. &#xA0;Support would be coming to him soon, so he didn&apos;t need to overextend himself.</span></p><p><span style="">He just had to wait for them to come.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ha-ah, ha-ah.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">He wasn&apos;t laboring, because of his wounds. The cause was his body, which was trying to recover from his wounds.</span></p><p><span style="">Blood&#x2026;&#x2026;. </span></p><p><span style="">He hungered for blood. It felt as if he was slowly losing his sense of reason as he felt dizziness. &#xA0;He was barely holding out.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Jaemin. &#xA0;You really aren&apos;t looking good right now.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ha-ah. &#xA0;I&apos;m all right.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;That&apos;s bullshit. &#xA0;Speed up your recovery, and lead us out of here.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Everyone&apos;s gaze turned to him at Joonsung&apos;s words. &#xA0;Everyone of the 17 people had a different reaction.</span></p><p><span style="">There were people, who were thankful towards Jaemin. &#xA0;He was fighting in their stead. &#xA0;However, these were entertainers and stars that considered the sacrifice undertaken by a Roused to be a given. </span></p><p><span style="">Jaemin got angry at Joonsung&apos;s words.</span></p><p><span style="">If he was to be blunt, everyone here except Soolgi was a lump he didn&apos;t care about.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Then do you want to help my recovery?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hoong. &#xA0;I knew you had a method.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Jaemin&apos;s eyes narrowed at Joonsung&apos;s words. Jaemin didn&apos;t have any reason to hide his anger, so he glared at Joonsung.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Then would &#xA0;you like to give me your blood? If I ingest blood, I&apos;ll recover from my wounds in a very short amount of time.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;&#x2026;.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">It was such an unconventional method that Joonsung became mute.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;If you want to go out so bad, shouldn&#x2019;t you sacrifice a little bit?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;W...why would I...&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Joonsung hesitated as he took several steps backwards. &#xA0;The light in Jaemin&apos;s eyes frightened him. Joonsung&apos;s legs shook. &#xA0;It was as if a snake was staring at him.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;If not, then just shut your mouth. &#xA0;You keep getting on my nerves.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Huh. &#xA0;Don&apos;t you know who I am? &#xA0;I&apos;m Joonsung. &#xA0;The Joonsung.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Of course, he knew who Joonsung was. &#xA0;He was the most popular male idol in Korea.</span></p><p><span style="">Jaemin didn&apos;t want to deal with him, so he turned his head away. </span></p><p><span style="">Soolgi looked at Jaemin as she approached him.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I&apos;ll give it to &#xA0;you.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;My blood.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;&#x2026;.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I donate blood quite frequently.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Jaemin looked at Soolgi in surprise. &#xA0;The light within her eyes were a mixture of worry, compassion and gratitude. She looked at him with those eyes.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ooh, ooh.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Her eyes, expression and feeling towards him made it too difficult for him. &#xA0;Jaemin&apos;s need was being agitated by temptation. &#xA0;He wanted to bite her. &#xA0;He wanted to get drunk on her blood.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ah, I can&apos;t.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">If he drank her blood, she wouldn&apos;t automatically become a vampire&apos;s puppet.</span></p><p><span style="">He had the choice as to whether he wanted to make a thrall or not. He just had to stop his intake after reaching an amount one would give at a blood drive... &#xA0;However, he didn&apos;t have the courage to show Soolgi his new self.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ha-ah. &#xA0;I won&apos;t.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Jaemin was having a hard time holding himself back, so he turned his head away. &#xA0;If he continued to look at Soolgi, it felt as if he would give into the temptation.</span></p><p><span style="">He needed to recover from his wounds, but this reason wasn&apos;t enough for him to rationalize drinking her blood. </span></p><p><span style="">He would be drink her blood to satisfy his craving.</span></p><p><span style="">He didn&apos;t want to shed the blood of Soolgi to satisfy his dirty desire. </span></p><p><span style="">Koong, kwahng. &#xA0;Ooh-roo-roong! </span></p><p><span style="">Everyone had a worried expression as they listened to the sound of monsters outside. &#xA0;The only one they could depend on right now was Jaemin.</span></p><p><span style="">Koo-roo-roong. </span></p><p><span style="">Their sense of worry increased dramatically when they heard the breathing sound of a monster getting louder. &#xA0;Soolgi couldn&apos;t wait any more. &#xA0;She thrust her wrist into Jaemin&apos;s mouth.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Suck on it.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ooh-uh, uhk.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">H...he shouldn&apos;t do this... Jaemin felt giddy as his canines pierced through Soolgi&apos;s wrist.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ooh ooh.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Soolgi&apos;s blood was quickly sucked out. &#xA0;Soolgi let out a moan as she felt faint.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;I...it&apos;s so sweet.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">Her blood couldn&apos;t be compared to the Blood Coffee sold at the Cafe. The feeling of ecstasy made Jaemin feel dizzy. &#xA0;The wound on his shoulder mended quickly, and the wound on his abdomen closed itself.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ha-ah, ha.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Jaemin opened his mouth in surprise, and he belatedly regretted his actions.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;I...I drank Soolgi&apos;s&#x2026;.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">He couldn&apos;t hide his eyes, which shook as if there was an earthquake going on. &#xA0;As if she understood what he was feeling, Soolgi hugged Jaemin tightly.</span></p><p><span style="">Wasn&apos;t Jaemin the one, who fought scary monsters, to save her?</span></p><p><span style="">She thought of the blood loss as a form of donation.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;I&apos;m ok.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;S...Soolgi.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I understand.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Soolgi.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Jaemin was close to tears as he hugged Soolgi. There was someone else besides Woojin hyung and his sister, who trusted him. &#xA0;He was so happy that it was beyond description.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Shit. Stop all this nonsense. &#xA0;Hurry up and take care of the monster outside!&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Joonsung&apos;s fear had reached its peak when he heard the sound of the monster, so he let out a frantic shout.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ah. You really have a harsh way of speaking....&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">After recovering from his injury, Jaemin frowned as he was about to stand up. &#xA0;His eyes became round when he caught sight of the space in front of him. There was a girl riding on a staff.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I found you, teacher!&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;B...butler Bibi.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">His reinforcement had arrived. &#xA0;If he had known she was here, he wouldn&apos;t have drunk Soolgi&apos;s blood....</span></p><p><span style="">Bibi got off her staff. &#xA0;Dolsae was spinning above her head.</span></p><p><span style="">Weeeeeeeng. </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Heh heh heh. Student Jaemin. &#xA0;Were you scared?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes. &#xA0;I really thought I was going to die.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Heh heh. &#xA0;You don&apos;t have to worry anymore.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Jaemin felt relief at Bibi&apos;s words. &#xA0;How could she be so dependable?</span></p><p><span style="">However, not everyone thought along the same line as Jaemin.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Who the hell is this shrimp?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Joonsung was traumatized by Tony&apos;s death, and the fear of dying made Joonsung&apos;s words sharp and combative.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Who the hell are you?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What? This little kid doesn&apos;t know who I am?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;How the hell should I know?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I&apos;m Joonsung. &#xA0;The Joonsung. &#xA0;Lee-joonsung!&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Bibi&apos;s cheek puffed out at his words.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;How would I know that? &#xA0;You look so dirty and unkempt.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;You little kid! &#xA0;Have you lost your mind?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Joonsung started to frown. &#xA0;Bibi glared at him.</span></p><p><span style="">Little kid was one of the words she hated the most.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;You want to die?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;If that is your wish, just die.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What the&#x2026;.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Joonsung was about to yell out in anger, when his eyes flipped up into his head. &#xA0;He fell to the floor. &#xA0;He would be tormented by a nightmare, and in the end, his life would come to an end.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hoong.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Bibi&apos;s mood had worsened. &#xA0;She turned her head towards Jaemin as she spoke.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Let&apos;s hurry up and get out of here. I have to go catch the big cat outside.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Was it because they were so loud?</span></p><p><span style="">Three black panthers had entered the studio, and they were letting out a roar.</span></p><p><span style="">Koo-roo-roo. </span></p><p><span style="">There were numerous humans here, and the black panthers planned on eating all of them.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Little kitties!&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">When the eyes of the black panthers headed towards the small child... &#xA0;Their eyes rolled back, and the black panthers fell to the floor.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Let&apos;s hurry up and go, student Jaemin.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;&#x2026;.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Bibi swung her arms as she exited the building. &#xA0;Jaemin and Soolgi followed after her. The people, who had been standing around awkwardly, followed after them. &#xA0;They didn&apos;t want to be left behind. &#xA0;A member of the same idol group put Joonsung on his back.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hoong? Just throw away that corpse.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;&#x2026;.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Joonsung was still breathing, so how could he...</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Well, it is up to you if you want to make a vain effort.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">The human would die when the dream ended. &#xA0;Well, it wasn&apos;t her problem anymore.</span></p><p><span style="">In the end, the only important person to her was Do-jaemin.</span></p><p><span style="">When she exited the broadcasting station, she looked towards an enormous tree located in the middle of the large parking lot. &#xA0;A giant puma had been guarding the tree. &#xA0;It stalked towards her.</span></p>
