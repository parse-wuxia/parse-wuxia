<p>Chapter 181 &#x2013; Hero Slaughterer (4)</p><p>13.</p><p><span style="">Hyrkan ran full tilt as he ran away towards the northern region of the Highwood Forest. &#xA0;At times, he saw Users passing by him at high speed.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;By the look of their Setting, they went all out for speed. &#xA0;It seems they are dead set on catching me.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">These Users had put all their Stat Points into Strength. &#xA0;They had Item Settings geared towards speed, and they had received all kinds of Speed Buffs. &#xA0;They even had consumable Items that could boost their speed. &#xA0;Moreover, they were experienced in running quickly through difficult terrains.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;How many&#x2026;.. &#xA0;If I combine the number of Strikers and the rear support team, will they number between 100 to 200? &#xA0;Will it be around 150 of them?&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">They would be blocking Hyrkan&#x2019;s path shortly.</span></p><p><span style="">When he saw what they were about to do, Hyrkan smiled.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;This is the best outcome I could have hoped for.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">He was being put into a desperately dangerous situation.</span></p><p><span style="">They were on the Hahoe Mask&#x2019;s tail, and eventually the body would be caught.</span></p><p><span style="">When they caught up to the body of the Hahoe Mask, it was obvious what the Big Smiles guild planned to do.</span></p><p><span style="">However, Hyrkan wasn&#x2019;t flustered. &#xA0;Of course, this was going as planned, and he wanted this to play out like this. </span></p><p><span style="">All work was like this. &#xA0;If one wanted good result, one had to go through a step by step process.</span></p><p><span style="">This venture was no different.</span></p><p><span style="">Giant Killing.</span></p><p><span style="">It was as the word implied. &#xA0;He would be taking down one of the 30 great guilds, which was akin to taking down a giant. &#xA0;He couldn&#x2019;t do it with only with viciousness and balls.</span></p><p><span style="">First, he had to fight within his weight class. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">This was why he had carried out this ridiculous revenge plot.</span></p><p><span style="">It was suicide for a Flyweight boxer to fight a Heavyweight boxer on the Heavyweight boxer&#x2019;s term.</span></p><p><span style="">The next problem was something he had learned in the past after fighting a war with the 30 great guilds. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">The act of slaying the giant was much easier than dealing with the aftermath.</span></p><p><span style="">If he had killed all eleven Users, the Pitbull revenge play would have come to an end. &#xA0;He would have to drop his vendetta. &#xA0;Hyrkan wouldn&#x2019;t have been able to use revenge as a cover in attacking the Big Smiles guild. &#xA0;If he attacked after completing his revenge, &#xA0;he would basically be openly announcing his hostility towards the Big Smiles guild. &#xA0;On the flip side, this implication also held true for the Big Smiles guild. &#xA0;Since the revenge play had come to an end, they would have to try to hide their conduct. &#xA0;They would have to catch the Hahoe Mask in secret. </span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;I forgave them.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">He had forgiven them.</span></p><p><span style="">He had brought the issue to a clean end.</span></p><p><span style="">Hahoe Mask had appeared in front of the Users, who had hunted down Pitbull, and he made it clear that he had forgiven them. &#xA0;He also apologized to them, and he gave them a sincere blessing. &#xA0;He wished them luck in getting good drops.</span></p><p><span style="">So what would happen if the Big Smiles guild moved immediately to kill the Hahoe Mask?</span></p><p><span style="">Who will be blamed for starting the war?</span></p><p><span style="">From that moment on, it would no longer be a revenge play.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;People always root for the underdog.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">The giant would be attacking a small private individual. &#xA0;They would attack him in an one-sided and indiscriminate manner.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;From now on, no matter what I do to fuck them over they won&#x2019;t be able to complain. &#xA0;They&#x2019;ll just have to take it.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">If this small individual suffered in such a manner, it didn&#x2019;t matter what he did. &#xA0;He could use whatever methods or tricks in his arsenal. &#xA0;His actions would be forgiven by the public. &#xA0;Moreover, people will actually cheer him on.</span></p><p><span style="">From now on, no one would point a finger in admonishment when they witness what he had planned. &#xA0;They&#x2019;ll give him a standing ovation.</span></p><p>14.</p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;That is&#x2026;.. &#xA0;The Hahoe Mask didn&#x2019;t harm the bait team.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">The Hahoe Mask hunting plan had been approved in the meeting of the executive officers. &#xA0;The next topic was to decide, who would be in command of the operation, and Apollo was given the baton.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What the hell are you talking about?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;That is&#x2026;.. &#xA0;The bait team is in a state of confusion right now, so I&#x2019;ll have to listen to them a little bit more. &#xA0;However, from what I gather, it seems the Hahoe Mask had forgiven them. &#xA0;No, he didn&#x2019;t forgive the bait team, but he forgave the Users, who hunted down Pitbull.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">No one had complained when Apollo was handed the command.</span></p><p><span style="">Apollo thought this was a great opportunity for him.</span></p><p><span style="">When he killed the Hahoe Mask, Apollo&#x2019;s power within the Big Smiles would increase significantly. &#xA0;This will allow Apollo to fix his weakness.</span></p><p><span style="">Apollo had basically bought his way into power. &#xA0;He was also placed in the sub-guild master chair, because he was perceived to be easier to control by Brooks. &#xA0;Moreover, unlike Heh-bibin, he didn&#x2019;t have the ability, awareness or the patience to build up his own power base. &#xA0;He would never be a threat to Brooks.</span></p><p><span style="">Of course, none of the Big Smiles guild members had unconditionally accepted his promotion. &#xA0;In such a situation, he had the chance to bring about the killing of the Hahoe Mask. &#xA0;All the guild members wanted the Hahoe Mask taken down, and he would have the support of the normal guild members if he succeeded. &#xA0;This task represented a symbolism he could use to gain power.</span></p><p><span style="">Of course, there was a catch. &#xA0;The catch was that he had to put his voice behind Heh-bibin. &#xA0;Furthermore, in return, Heh-bibin promised to support Apollo from now on. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">If such a deal wasn&#x2019;t in place, he wouldn&#x2019;t have risked stabbing Brooks in the back. &#xA0;Brooks was the one, who had placed him within the Big Smiles guild.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;So what?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">The fact that the Hahoe Mask hadn&#x2019;t bothered with the bait team didn&#x2019;t change anything for Apollo.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What are you trying to say? What&#x2019;s going on with the Hahoe Mask hunt?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">He didn&#x2019;t care about the status of the bait team. &#xA0;The only thing important was the fact that Apollo had the chance to kill the Hahoe Mask. &#xA0;He had the chance to break the Hahoe Mask&#x2019;s wrists.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;We are in pursuit. &#xA0;We are also intermittently engaging him in battle.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What is the current situation?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;We&#x2019;ll be able to corner him. &#xA0;Our hunting team is faster than him.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">They had made a lot of preparations. &#xA0;The Highwood forest was a difficult stage, so the elites of the guild were all gathered there. &#xA0;It wouldn&#x2019;t be an exaggeration to say that any Big Smiles guild member with a modicum of skill was gathered there.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Then catch him for me.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">At Apollo&#x2019;s words, there wasn&#x2019;t much more to say. &#xA0;The one giving the report didn&#x2019;t give any advices to Apollo.</span></p><p><span style="">It wasn&#x2019;t as if Apollo was the only one, who wanted to kill the Hahoe Mask. &#xA0;There wasn&#x2019;t a single guild member within the Big Smiles guild, who looked favorably at the Hahoe Mask. &#xA0;Moreover, the bait team was bait. &#xA0;When a fish bites the bait, one doesn&#x2019;t worry if the bait was fine or damaged. &#xA0;No fisherman would worry about whether a bait was intact when one had to reel in the fish.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Anyways, he is about to reach the border between the Red Desert and the Highwood Forest.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Red Desert?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes, we&#x2019;ll be able to surround him there.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;All right.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Everyone&#x2019;s favorite prey was heading north.</span></p><p><span style="">The Red Desert was acknowledged to be dangerous by the Big Smiles guild. &#xA0;It was a place where they forbid their guild members from hunting, yet they were heading there.</span></p><p>15.</p><p><span style="">The Hahoe Mask was surrounded.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;There are quite a lot of them.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">If one stood atop the large trees filling up the Highwood forest, one could catch sight of the Red Desert. &#xA0;One could see about thirty Strikers surrounding the Hahoe Mask to the north.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;They made pretty extensive preparations.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">The encircling net was tight.</span></p><p><span style="">At any point in time, the encircling net could let fly their swords towards Hyrkan. &#xA0;They were prepared to sacrifice their lives for the Hahoe Mask Hunt.</span></p><p><span style="">At the same time, they were waiting for something.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;The Hahoe Mask&#x2019;s Skeletons hasn&#x2019;t made their appearance yet.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;We have to eliminate whatever the Hahoe Mask brings to bear before we can eliminate him.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;This might turn into a prolonged battle.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">There were two ways to hunt the Hahoe Mask.</span></p><p><span style="">The first method was to kill the Hahoe Mask before he could bring out all his cards. &#xA0;The other method was to force the Hahoe Mask to bring out all his cards then kill him.</span></p><p><span style=""> The former method seemed easy, but the Hahoe Mask had a frightening amount of skill in battle even if he didn&#x2019;t have his Skeletons and Golems. &#xA0;In the Argardo Raid, Immoral Prince Raid and the Anugas raid, he showed such proficiency that all Strikers praised the Hahoe Mask&#x2019;s peerless skills.</span></p><p><span style="">This was why the second option was preferable. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">It was to force the Hahoe Mask to bring out all his cards!</span></p><p><span style="">It wasn&#x2019;t easy, but it wasn&#x2019;t impossible. &#xA0;The Hahoe Mask could not summon an unlimited number of Skeletons and Golems. &#xA0;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">They have over 50 Strikers, and twice the number of magicians and priests&#x2026;. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">There were close to 150 Users gathered here, and these weren&#x2019;t the normal Users of Big Smiles guild. &#xA0;These were the best of the best of the Big Smiles guild, so the task of eliminating the Hahoe Mask&#x2019;s familiars shouldn&#x2019;t be too difficult for them. &#xA0;These Users thought of Big Smiles as being the best, so they considered themselves to be the best.</span></p><p><span style="">This was why they were forcing this confrontation.</span></p><p><span style="">However, even in this harsh atmosphere, Hyrkan was able to speak up.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Why are you guys attacking me?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan used this lull to ask a question. &#xA0;The voice asking the question was very loud.</span></p><p><span style="">Of course, all the Users were focused on Hyrkan&#x2019;s every movement, so they were all able to hear his words.</span></p><p><span style="">They were taken aback by the question.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;What?&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">They would have preferred if the Hahoe Mask was overbearing. &#xA0;They would have had an easier time accepting swear words from the Hahoe Mask than what they were getting right now.</span></p><p><span style="">Instead, he had ask them a question.</span></p><p><span style="">Why were they attacking him?</span></p><p><span style="">No one could answer that question. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan once again asked them a question.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Didn&#x2019;t I forgive the Users, who hunted down Pitbull?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan didn&#x2019;t even bother to unsheathe his weapon as he spoke. &#xA0;He had his arms crossed as if he was lecturing them.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I&#x2019;m pretty sure I&#x2019;ve expressed my intentions not too long ago. &#xA0;I will no longer pursue my revenge. &#xA0;I haven&#x2019;t attacked the remaining eight Users. &#xA0;Moreover, I didn&#x2019;t mess with the Big Smiles guild members hunting within the Highwood Forest.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">This was obvious, but the Hahoe Mask hunt team hadn&#x2019;t known about this fact. &#xA0;They had just chased after Hyrkan.</span></p><p><span style="">After receiving a report from the bait team, there was no way Apollo would have informed the Hahoe Mask hunt team of these facts.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;So why is the Big Smiles guild keep trying to attack me? &#xA0;Are you guys trying to punish me as a guild?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">The continuous questions created a disordered atmosphere amongst the Big Smiles guild members.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;What the hell is he talking about?&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;He forgave them? That actually happened?&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">In the end, someone had to step forward to rile up the troops. &#xA0;The User, who was leading the Hahoe Mask hunt team, had the level, experience and the ability to realize this fact. &#xA0;He quickly stepped forward.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;It is as you said, Hahoe Mask. &#xA0;This is a punishment. &#xA0;&#xA0;As you probably know, the relationship between the Big Smiles guild and you is bad enough where we don&#x2019;t need to explain ourselves in eliminating each other.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">These were the words spoken previously by Hyrkan towards the Big Smiles guild.</span></p><p><span style="">This was why Hyrkan nodded his head.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;So it is a punishment. &#xA0;Therefore, I can use whatever methods and tricks to survive this assault?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;You can try. &#xA0;We aren&apos;t weak. &#xA0;We&#x2019;ll be able to catch a prey like you, who is right in front of our eyes.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">After speaking those words, the leader of the hunt team used the Voice Talk to give orders to the Strikers surrounding the Hahoe Mask.</span></p><p><span style="">- You guys attack the Hahoe Mask first, then he&#x2019;ll start using the his cards.</span></p><p><span style="">- When I give the signal, the 1st team will move. &#xA0;The 2nd team will be ready to counteract any changes. &#xA0;The 3rd team will act as support. </span></p><p><span style="">- If you are in trouble, I want you guys to retreat to the backline, so you can receive healing from the Priests.</span></p><p><span style="">- The Magicians should look out for the signal to start the magical bombardment.</span></p><p><span style="">There was no reason why they should give Hyrkan more time. &#xA0;If he wouldn&#x2019;t pull out his cards, they would have to force it out of him.</span></p><p><span style="">Now everyone was tense as they waited for a signal. &#xA0;The leader of the hunt team was mulling over when to give out the signal.</span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan still didn&#x2019;t show any signs of fighting. &#xA0;He continued to speak with his arms folded. &#xA0;It was as if he wanted to buy some time.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Are any of you subscribed to my youtube page? &#xA0;Raise your hands.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Of course, no one raised their hands. &#xA0;No one was flustered by his words.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;My intuition say they&#x2019;ll be attacking soon. &#xA0;Their timing is impeccable.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">As Hyrkan looked at them, he forcefully stopped himself from smiling. &#xA0;He maintained a neutral expression as he continued to speak.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;There&#x2019;s a video over there explaining the special characteristics of the my Skills. &#xA0;The description of the Skill I&#x2019;m about to use will be uploaded there soon.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;The countdown has started&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">At the same time, Hyrkan started to count inside. &#xA0;He started to countdown from the initial number he chose.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;It&#x2019;s a Skill that was reinforced by the Ancient Power I recently gained. &#xA0;It was a Legendary Rank Ancient power, and I used it to reinforce the Bone Explosive Skill. &#xA0;I don&#x2019;t think you guys have a high level Necromancer within your guild, so you probably don&#x2019;t know about the effects of reinforcing this Skill. &#xA0;Do you guys at least know about the Bone Explosive Skill?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">At that moment, Hyrkan unfurled his arms. &#xA0;Then he took out a small bomb from a pouch attached to his waist. &#xA0;The Bone Explosive looked like a skull, and there was a thumb-length wick attached to it.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;The Bone Explosive skill causes this to explode. &#xA0;Once I reinforced this Skill, it gained the time bomb option. &#xA0;At most, I can set the bomb to explode after 6 hours.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">At that moment, Hyrkan unfurled his hand. &#xA0;He straightened all five fingers.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Five, four, three&#x2026;...&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">He folded his fingers as he spoke. &#xA0;He started with his thumb, and he kept moving onto the next finger. &#xA0;He finally arrived at the pinky finger.</span></p><p><span style="">When it folded, the number zero was spoken by Hyrkan.</span></p><p><span style="">Kwah-kwahng, kwahng, kwah-ahng! </span></p><p><span style="">It started from beneath the feet of the Strikers surrounding Hyrkan. &#xA0;It occurred from all direction, and it was several dozen&#x2026;. &#xA0;No, over 200 area started to explode in succession.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What the hell?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;It&#x2019;s an attack!&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">The bombs went off like dominoes falling.</span></p><p><span style="">In other words, it was quite the sight. &#xA0;It was as if fireworks were being detonated.</span></p><p><span style="">The spectators could only look on and focus on the spectacular, powerful and unique attack. &#xA0;Most of those not involved in the explosion looked at the sight.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Ok.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">During all of this, Hyrkan ran towards the north.</span></p><p><span style="">- Maintain the perimeter! </span></p><p><span style="">When the Big Smiles guilds became distracted, Hyrkan immediately broke through the perimeter.</span></p><p><span style="">He faced the User that was blocking the path in front of him. &#xA0;The User had been busy looking at the explosions, and when he became aware of the Hahoe Mask, it was too late. &#xA0;The Hahoe Mask was within weapon range.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Attack!&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">At that moment, the User reacted reflexively. &#xA0;However, this was insufficient to beat an opponent like the Hahoe Mask.</span></p><p><span style="">The User needed his comrades to help him, but they wouldn&#x2019;t reach him in time. &#xA0;It took the Hahoe Mask less than three seconds to dispatch the User.</span></p><p><span style="">The User swung his sword like lightning. &#xA0;He brought it down from up high.</span></p><p><span style="">Shweek! </span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan looked as if he was attempting a wrestling tackle, and the User&#x2019;s sword was brought down on Hyrkan&#x2019;s back.</span></p><p><span style="">Kah-ahng! </span></p><p><span style="">The sounds of steel hitting steel was heard.</span></p><p><span style="">However, that was the only effect it produced. &#xA0;Hyrkan was wearing the Black Spot set, and it was still considered to be the set with the most defense. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">A scar formed on the armor, yet Hyrkan didn&#x2019;t receive any damage.</span></p><p><span style="">Hweeek! </span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan grabbed his opponent by the waist, and it was as if he was pulling a tree out of its roots. &#xA0;Hyrkan threw his opponent backwards.</span></p><p><span style="">In a flash, a path was formed, and Hyrkan charged through the newly opened path.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Block him!&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan hadn&#x2019;t even bothered to engage the User in a fight. &#xA0;No one expected him to just throw his opponent. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">What kind of User would think of such a method, and actually follow through with it?</span></p><p><span style="">Of course, there was no plan put in place to deal with such a scenario. &#xA0;One could order people to stop Hyrkan, but it was fruitless.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I want you guys to run past him, and cordon him off!&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">In the end, they could only attempt the same plan as before.</span></p><p><span style="">They ran past the Hahoe Mask to form a line, and the line turned into a encircling net again. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">The Big Smiles guild&#x2019;s efforts brought them into the Red Desert, but they were already committed to carrying this out.</span></p><p><span style="">The stage had changed, but the encircling net surrounded the Hahoe Mask once again.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I&#x2019;ll follow you to the depth of hell.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Someone growled those words at the Hahoe Mask. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">As if to answer those words, Hyrkan flicked his finger twice.</span></p><p><span style="">It was a signal.</span></p><p><span style="">It was like the Anugas raid. &#xA0;He had summoned the Skeletons beforehand, and he had put them in Defensive mode. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">Now the Skeletons would come towards the Hahoe Mask. &#xA0;In the process, they would kill anything that was in their way. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">- It&#x2019;s the Skeletons! </span></p><p><span style="">- Shit. &#xA0;He summoned and stashed it beforehand! </span></p><p><span style="">- Support! &#xA0;Support! &#xA0;It&#x2019;ll be too tough for the Magicians and Priests to block the Skeletons! </span></p><p><span style="">The Skeletons encountered the Magicians and Priests first, who were on standby in the rear.</span></p><p><span style="">Of course, this was also the proof they needed.</span></p><p><span style="">- Attack him! </span></p><p><span style="">- The Hahoe Mask is out of cards now! </span></p><p><span style="">It was proof that Hyrkan had already taken out most of his cards. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">They could now attack with the knowledge that Hyrkan was pretty much defenseless. </span></p><p><span style="">Both sides signaled at the same time. &#xA0;The leader of the hunt party sent a signal ordering an attack on the Hahoe Mask.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Kill!&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Everyone ran towards the Hahoe Mask. &#xA0;A portion of the group stopped to used their Crescent Moon Cut Skill. &#xA0;They sent their sword energy towards Hyrkan.</span></p><p><span style="">Several dozen sword energies split the air as it headed towards the Hahoe Mask.</span></p><p><span style="">Hahoe Mask didn&#x2019;t try to avoid the sword energies.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;I&#x2019;ll block it.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">He used the time he would have used to dodge to summon his Golem. &#xA0;He summoning as fast as he was able to, so he summoned a Golem, while not using the Clay Play Skill. &#xA0;&#xA0;Then he started to summon all the Golems he was able to summon.</span></p><p><span style="">Poohk! </span></p><p><span style="">First, he quickly stabbed a sword in the sands. &#xA0;He used it to initiate his summoning of the Iron Golem. &#xA0;Only the tip of the sword sunk into the sands, and it started to pour out liquid steel.</span></p><p><span style="">[You&#x2019;ve summoned the Golem.] </span></p><p><span style="">The next one to take shape was the Earth Golem.</span></p><p><span style="">The Earth Golem rose out of the red sand, and it took form.</span></p><p><span style="">[You&#x2019;ve summoned the Fire Golem..] </span></p><p><span style="">Hwah-roo-roo! </span></p><p><span style="">The next one was the Fire Golem. &#xA0;Fire streamed out of Hyrkan&#x2019;s right hand, and the Fire Golem took shape.</span></p><p><span style="">[You&#x2019;ve summoned the Ice Golem..] </span></p><p><span style="">A shard of ice grew for Hyrkan&#x2019;s left hand like a tree. &#xA0;In a flash, it grew larger, and it sprouted limbs. &#xA0;This was the first time the Ice Golem made its appearance in Warlord.</span></p><p><span style="">The Iron Golem was the first to be initiated, but it also the slowest to form. </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Bring in the Golem elimination team!&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ranged attacks!&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Get close to them, and try the Armor Breaking!&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I&#x2019;m requesting a long ranged bombardment!&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">The three Golems had already taken form. &#xA0;The fourth Golem continued to take sword energy strikes and various sword Skills from the Strikers. &#xA0;The Iron Golem formed after taking multiple deep wounds. &#xA0;The Iron Golem appeared in its tough form.</span></p><p><span style="">The four Golems were all assembled now.</span></p><p><span style="">While this was occurring, Hyrkan started to battle with the four Users, who were approaching him.</span></p><p><span style="">He faced the foremost User, who was bring his sword down.</span></p><p><span style="">Kah-ahng! </span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan didn&#x2019;t even unsheathe his sword. &#xA0;He raised his left arm to block the descending sword.</span></p><p><span style="">Shweek! </span></p><p><span style="">The two other Users came at Hyrkan from both sides as they used their swords like spears. &#xA0;They charged to close the distance.</span></p><p><span style="">Before they could reach him, Hyrkan grabbed the sword arm of his opponent. &#xA0;Then he used a judo throw.</span></p><p><span style="">Kwah-ahng! </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Uh?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">The User was suddenly thrown to the floor, and the User had a dumbfounded expression within his helmet. &#xA0;He had never experienced a judo throw within Warlord, and he also never experienced falling this easily.</span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan squatted down in place to dodge the attack coming from both sides. &#xA0;The two swords passed above Hyrkan&#x2019;s head as they intersected.</span></p><p><span style="">Koo-oohng! </span></p><p><span style="">Then the two Users crashed into each other.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ooh-ahk!&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Below! &#xA0;Below!&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">The two Users, who crashed into each other, quickly righted themselves. &#xA0;They tried to attack Hyrkan again, but Hyrkan already moved behind one of the Users. &#xA0;After he moved behind the User, Hyrkan grabbed his opponent&#x2019;s waist.</span></p><p><span style="">Shoohk! </span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan easily lifted the User, and Hyrkan threw him into the other User.</span></p><p><span style="">The User was flying towards his comrade, and the comrade raised both hands to catch him. &#xA0;The comrade fell on his butt as he caught him.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Uhk!&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;W...what the hell?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Three Users were defeated in a flash, and they had a dumbfounded expression on their faces. &#xA0;In terms of HP, they hadn&#x2019;t suffered any damage, &#xA0;However, this experience gave them psychological damage instead of the damage to their bodies.</span></p><p><span style="">The remaining User decided not to attack the Hahoe Mask. </span></p><p><span style="">Instead, he started yelling out. </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Support! Support!&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">He had seen the Hahoe Mask&#x2019;s method of fighting, and the User knew he had no chance in defeating the Hahoe Mask by himself.</span></p><p><span style="">Unfortunately, the ones to react to the shout for support wasn&#x2019;t his comrades or the support team.. </span></p><p><span style="">Pooh-hwaht! </span></p><p><span style="">These were large snakes with hardened scales that reminded one of bugs.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;It&#x2019;s the Sand Snakes!&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">The snakes had reacted to the large amounts of landmines, and the ruckus going on above the surface of the Red Desert.</span></p><p>16.</p><p><span style="">Pandemonium. </span></p><p><span style="">This was the only apt description of this stage.</span></p><p><span style="">Koohng koohng! </span></p><p><span style="">There were four enormous Golems running amok above the Red Desert. &#xA0;The Golems were full of wounds, and a loud sound emanated every time a damanged part of the Golems fell to the floor. &#xA0;&#xA0;This added more confusion to this already ridiculous battlefield.</span></p><p><span style="">Pooh-hwaht! </span></p><p><span style="">Six Sand Snakes were moving below and above the sand for their hunt. &#xA0;They were akin &#xA0;to fireworks detonating above an already chaotic situation. &#xA0;They further pushed a chaotic situation into an absolute mess.</span></p><p><span style="">There were only six or seven Strikers from the Big Smiles guild, who were able to properly engage the Hahoe mask in battle. &#xA0;The number was very lacking if one wanted to kill the Hahoe Mask.</span></p><p><span style="">In such a shit show, the support team was supposed to stabilize the situation, but not a single member of the support team was in sight. &#xA0;They were in a battle against the group of Skeletons.</span></p><p><span style="">Of course, deaths started to blossom inside this pandemonium.</span></p><p><span style="">[The Skeleton Warrior has reverted to being a Fragment.] </span></p><p><span style="">[The Skeleton Knight has reverted to being a Fragment.] </span></p><p><span style="">The Skeletons were falling.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Shit!&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Recovery Item! &#xA0;Give me some Recovery Items!&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I&#x2019;m out!&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What about the Priests?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;They are battling the Skeletons.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">The Users died.</span></p><p><span style="">[Golem has returned to the earth.] </span></p><p><span style="">[Ice Golem is starting to melt.] </span></p><p><span style="">The Golems had taken too much damage, and they were starting to fall apart.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;We&apos;ve killed a Sand Snake!&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;There are four Sand Snakes left. &#xA0;Be careful!&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">The Sand Snake couldn&#x2019;t avoid death either in this pandemonium.</span></p><p><span style="">Moreover, the Hahoe Mask hadn&#x2019;t remained unscathed.</span></p><p><span style="">The continous battle ruined his Black Spot set. &#xA0;The parts that were least damaged were dented, and there were even parts where the armor itself had broken off. &#xA0;One could see flesh beneath the armor.</span></p><p><span style="">His left arm was especially in a bad state. &#xA0;His armor and glove had fallen off, so his bare arm could be seen. &#xA0;His wristwatch on his left wrist was exposed. &#xA0;It was undefended, since there were no armor over his arm.</span></p><p><span style="">The Users facing Hyrkan took this as a source of comfort.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Look! &#xA0;We just have to cut off his wrist now.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Be strong!
