<p><span style="">Chapter 122 - Bad Ending? (3)</span></p><p>9.</p><p><span style="">When the V&amp;V guild and the 8 other guilds announced their intention of sitting out the great battle, it didn&apos;t really cause much change to the overall flow of the great battle.</span></p><p><span style="">Of course, nothing was felt. &#xA0;The normal Users didn&apos;t feel much difference, because the announcement that the 9 guilds wouldn&apos;t participate was meaningless. &#xA0;This was like a politician earnestly spouting nonsense towards another politician.</span></p><p><span style="">The ones affected the most was the 30 great guilds.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;What nonsense are these crazy bastards suddenly spouting?&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;If they can&apos;t have it, then we can&apos;t have it either? &#xA0;Is that it?&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">The rest of the 30 great guilds had planned on entering into the great battle at the right moment. Aside from the 9 guilds, the rest of the 30 guilds had to temporarily pause all the plans they had made.</span></p><p><span style="">Of course, this didn&apos;t mean the 9 guilds, who announced their non-participation, had a lot of influence or authority over the other guilds.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;The one to step forward first will be hit the hardest.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;There is no need to be the first one to get bludgeoned.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;This might be better for us. &#xA0;The great battle is more difficult than expected. &#xA0;We should use this time to put our forces in order.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">In the end, everyone&apos;s choice came down to calculating the cost. </span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;If we look at what&apos;s happening right now, the Corrupted army is dominating the battlefield. Eventually, they&apos;ll need us.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;We can still work at the individual level. &#xA0;We just have to keep our guild&apos;s name out of the spotlight.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">The ones, who were most affected aside from the 30 great guilds, was the Underfoot guilds.</span></p><p><span style="">While the 30 great guilds were punching figures into their calculators, the Underfoot guilds were aggressively participating in the great battle.</span></p><p><span style="">However, their participation couldn&apos;t change the tide of the battle. &#xA0;Still, there had only been consecutive losses before, but now there were increasing number of victories.</span></p><p><span style="">This was especially true for the Fighters guild. Whistling Pitbull&apos;s stellar performance was &#xA0;dazzling.</span></p><p><span style="">- Did the Fighters guild win again? </span></p><p><span style="">- He did it! &#xA0;He did it! &#xA0;Pitbull did it! </span></p><p><span style="">- Pitbull made a breach as he put his life on the line. The Users were sheeps without a shepherd, but now they have someone to flock towards. Someone really has to take the lead. </span></p><p><span style="">In truth, the Fighters guild more than likely would have lost their first foray into the great battle. They were using methods that had failed before. Their line of Tankers hadn&apos;t performed up to par, and the command structure had not been solidified. &#xA0;The mages rained down magic indiscriminately as they damaged allies and enemies equally. &#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">In the end, everyone thought this was a wasted effort... &#xA0;The Users were getting ready to bail out quickly.</span></p><p><span style="">This was when Whistling Pitbull marshaled his comrades, and they charged forward.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Break through! Burrow in as deep as you can! The side that can break through the other&apos;s battle line wins!&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Whistling Pitbull was going to be surrounded by monsters, but he didn&apos;t show a single ounce of fear. &#xA0;Whistling Pitbull unhesitatingly charged forward, and this sight changed the heart of some Users.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;All right. Let&apos;s try at least once. It isn&apos;t as if we can runaway forever.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;If I wanted to run away all the time in a paid game, I would be playing Pacman.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Follow Whistling Pitbull in! We&apos;ll live if we stick together!&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">The Users that had been about to run away changed their minds. &#xA0;They ran back into the battlefield, and they fought with Whistling Pitbull as they formed a wedge. Everything was resolved rapidly afterwards. &#xA0;The Corrupted army was broken in half, and the Corrupted army broke up further to form smaller groups. &#xA0;The Users defeated them one by one. &#xA0;Most of the Users weren&apos;t talented at fighting a large group like the Corrupted army, but they had a lot of experience in taking down small number of monsters.</span></p><p><span style="">The Fighters guild had broken the streak of losses, and they were somewhat able to direct the Users.</span></p><p><span style="">However, this method couldn&apos;t be replicated by others, and it wasn&apos;t an answer that would change the tide of the battle.</span></p><p><span style="">They needed a strategy instead of directions. &#xA0;They needed a tactic where anyone could copy it, and the result had to be certain. &#xA0;They needed a method where the effect could be seen immediately!</span></p><p><span style="">A User appeared to propose such a method.</span></p><p>10.</p><p><span style="">&#x201C;One of the special characteristics of the Corrupted army is the Siege mode where their vision narrows. If put in simpler terms, they won&apos;t stop marching even if the comrade next to them is killed. This is why it is very easy to hunt the monsters on the periphery while they are moving. This is what knowledgeable people call Gnawing.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">In the footage, there was a man wearing a red Hahoe Mask standing in front of a castle. &#xA0;He was pointing at the Corrupted Army, while he earnestly gave an explanation.</span></p><p><span style="">On another video, the Corrupted army had broken through the Castle gate. &#xA0;As if this wasn&apos;t enough, the Corrupted army broke down the castle wall, and they marched past the rubble. </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;The fact that the castle gate and castle wall had fallen doesn&apos;t have to signal the end of a battle.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">In this video, the man wearing a red Hahoe Mask was giving an explanation again.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Actually, this is the time to attack. &#xA0;When a castle gate is breached or a castle wall falls, there is something that will always happen! This congestion of traffic always happens! &#xA0;A small number of Tankers can buy time. &#xA0;At the same time, AOE magic can be used on the monsters stuck in the bottleneck. &#xA0;The effect would be beyond description. If you can maintain this line, the defense of the castle is possible.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">The footage switched to the sight of numerous buildings within the castle being destroyed.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;The buildings are incredible obstacles for the monsters. &#xA0;There is no reason why you shouldn&apos;t use the obstacles to your advantage. The street fights are the last battle before the castle is lost, but it is also the battle where the advantage is overwhelmingly in the User&#x2019;s favor. &#xA0;Don&apos;t panic, because it is a street fight. &#xA0;Enjoy it. This will be the chance to participate in the most easiest hunts, so don&apos;t run away.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">It was a video regarding tactics. </span></p><p><span style="">The Hahoe Mask unhesitatingly put out videos where he showed tactics on how to defeat the Corrupted army.</span></p><p><span style="">The Users were brooding from the fact that they kept losing in the great battle. &#xA0;The video was like sweet water to the Users, who had suffered.</span></p><p><span style="">- I acknowledge this is a very good tip! </span></p><p><span style="">- It is as the Hahoe Mask said. You have to approach the Corrupted army laterally instead of a head-to-head contest. The battle becomes very easy. The Gnawing method is really sweet! </span></p><p><span style="">- He uploaded a jar of honey instead of videos. Thank you for the treat.</span></p><p><span style="">Of course, not everyone looked favourably on the Hahoe Mask&apos;s actions.</span></p><p><span style="">- Why did you reveal this? &#xA0;Take down the vids.</span></p><p><span style="">- Ah. &#xA0;Every time I&apos;m trying to harvest some honey, bastards like you who are crazy about views mess everything up. Take down the vids!</span></p><p><span style="">- Hahoe Mask. &#xA0;Unless you want to cry from being PKed, pull the videos.</span></p><p><span style="">There were Users, who had been making a killing using the know-how dropped by Hyrkan. &#xA0;From their perspective, it was as if Hyrkan had broken the jar of honey they had been consuming. Of course, they didn&apos;t look favourably at Hyrkan&apos;s release of information.</span></p><p><span style="">However, it was the same for Hyrkan.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Shit. &#xA0;Do you think I&apos;m doing this, because I like it?&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan had been the one drinking the most from the honey pot he had revealed. &#xA0;Hyrkan had planned on using the methods he had revealed to earn the Great Battle&apos;s Hero title and other rewards. In truth, he had been taking full advantage of it until now.</span></p><p><span style="">However, the situation had changed.</span></p><p><span style="">The Users had to win the great battle. The result of the great battle was incredibly important to him. &#xA0;From Hyrkan&apos;s perspective, he had no choice.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;I have to spread a lot of bait like this to reignite the interest of the regular Users.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">The string of defeats had caused a lot of disappointments, and a lot of Users had turned away from participating in the great battle. &#xA0;He needed to provide candies to turn them around.</span></p><p><span style="">Moreover, this wasn&apos;t the end. There was a limit on how many he can lure back with sweets. &#xA0;While the gaze of the Users were back on the stage of the great battle, he had to make their bodies burn with fighting spirit. &#xA0;He had to make their body itch from the need to participate in the great battle.</span></p><p><span style="">This meant his most difficult task was yet to be accomplished.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;I&apos;m working like a dog, yet what if the Ruined Kingdom Quest Route is different from what I know from before... &#xA0;If so, I&apos;ll find a way to blow up Tobosoft&apos;s server.&#x2019;</span></p><p>11.</p><p><span style="">Shezga castle.</span></p><p><span style="">It was an adequate distance away from Misandra&apos;s castle. &#xA0;Like the Misandra&apos;s Castle, the Shezga castle was where level 80 to level 100 Users stayed.</span></p><p><span style="">However, the Shezga castle&apos;s Subjugation Association was surrounded by a lot of users, who had already went through their 1st Advancement.</span></p><p><span style="">There were almost 1000 Users of varying classes present. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">Normally, two to three thousand Users participated in great battles at castles, so this was a relatively low turn out. &#xA0;Of course, the expectation for victory at the Shezga castle was inevitably low.</span></p><p><span style="">This was when Hyrkan appeared in front of them. &#xA0;Unlike yesterday, he was wearing his red Hahoe Mask, and his appearance created a sensation.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Uh? It&apos;s the Hahoe mask!&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Thank you for the videos!&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I&apos;ll take advantage of the tips you us.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Accompanying Hyrkan&apos;s appearance, a great number of Users sent their goodwill towards him. &#xA0;Hyrkan left behind the crowd, and he entered the Subjugation Association. &#xA0;&#xA0;Unlike outside of the Subjugation Association building, there weren&apos;t that many people inside the building.</span></p><p><span style="">There were 12 Users.</span></p><p><span style="">These Users had been nominated, and they were given command of the forces that would be fighting in the great battle. They were given the title of Centurions.</span></p><p><span style="">When the Users kept losing, they realized they needed a command structure at the very least. &#xA0;They decided to gather in a group of 100 Users, and each group decided to nominate a group leader. &#xA0;Of course, this wasn&apos;t a prestigious seat. &#xA0;They were given command, but they were something akin to a leader of a college group project.</span></p><p><span style="">They weren&apos;t happy with the appearance of Hyrkan.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Why is the Hahoe Mask here?&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;He always soloed everything up until now. &#xA0;There is no reason why he should show up here.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">They all were in agreement that the appearance of Hyrkan would help their beleaguered force, but Hyrkan had never operated with a group before. &#xA0;He was strictly an outsider.</span></p><p><span style="">This meant he had a purpose in coming here.</span></p><p><span style="">When Hyrkan entered the room, he immediately walked towards the Centurions. </span></p><p><span style="">There was a distance of about 15 meters between them and the door. &#xA0;About a dozen steps were taken by Hyrkan, and the sound of his steps pressed down hard on the slightly disordered atmosphere within the Subjugation Association. &#xA0;When he came to a stop, there was silence, and everyone stared at Hyrkan&apos;s mouth.</span></p><p><span style="">He opened his mouth.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I want to command this great battle. Do you mind handing the operational authority to me?&#x201D;</span></p><p>12.</p><p><span style="">&#x201C;We greatly admire the Hahoe Mask&apos;s exploits. &#xA0;If you ask for the operational authority, of course, we will give it to you.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">They gave their answer. </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Did you expect to hear some bullshit answer along that line? &#xA0;I hope not&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">It was an unequivocal rejection.</span></p><p><span style="">At the same time, there was a vehement response to Hyrkan&apos;s request.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;You suddenly appeared here, and you are asking for the operational authority? &#xA0;Why should we give that to you?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;If an outsiders saw this, they&apos;ll think we are your underlings by the way you treat us. However, we are utter strangers.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">This was to be expected.</span></p><p><span style="">The Hahoe Mask&apos;s fame was incredible. &#xA0;Of course, one&apos;s eyes would be blinded when staring at his fame, which was brilliant. Even though they were drunk on his fame, this didn&apos;t mean Hyrkan had a right to treat them as his servants. </span></p><p><span style="">The Centurions gathered here were all pretty high level, and they had a plethora of battle experience under them. &#xA0;They couldn&apos;t play the game as well as Hyrkan, but their passion and interest for this game weren&apos;t any less than Hyrkan.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;You can&apos;t give it to me?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;If you immediately go outside and you are able to get 66% of the participating Users to sign a written consent, then we&apos;ll give you the operational authority to you.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan snorted at his words. &#xA0;They were asking for a written consent. &#xA0;It was possible in real life, but it was something impossible to do in Warlord.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Let&apos;s make this simple. &#xA0;How about we decide this through PVP?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan gave a counter proposal. &#xA0;It was more of a provocation than a proposal.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Why would we agree to such a crazy proposal? &#xA0;There are plenty of reasons on Youtube that says we shouldn&apos;t fight the Hahoe Mask.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">However, no one fell for his provocation. It wasn&apos;t about falling for it or not. &#xA0;This was normal in Warlord. Most of the Users in Warlord solved disagreements through words. It was rare to see a disagreement be solved through PVP or PK.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;If you insist on fighting your way, this will turn out like the battle at Misandra&apos;s castle. &#xA0;I have a decent plan in mind.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;You don&apos;t know what we want. &#xA0;We are going to kill a decent amount of monsters then we&apos;ll escape. &#xA0;We didn&apos;t come here to win.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Someone stood up from his seat, and he slowly walked to stand in front of Hyrkan. &#xA0;At his appearance, everyone shut their mouths. It seemed this person had a strong voice within the group of Centurions.</span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan also recognized him when he checked his face. &#xA0;He unconsciously pursed his lips as if he was about to whistle.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Big K? The Submariner is here?&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">Big K. </span></p><p><span style="">Currently, he was level 175, and he was a magician that had gone through his 1st Advancement to become a Magus Magnus.</span></p><p><span style="">His nickname was the Submariner. &#xA0;He used to be a baseball player, and he used his underhand pitching form to throw his magic.</span></p><p><span style="">His method of delivery was unexpectedly quite effective. &#xA0;A great number of monsters had a high amount of defense against attacks coming from the front or the top. However, they were relatively vulnerable to an attack that exploded from the bottom.</span></p><p><span style="">Since he was a former baseball player, the accuracy of his magic couldn&apos;t even be compared to the normal Users.</span></p><p><span style="">Moreover, he was affiliated with the Red Bulls.</span></p><p><span style="">He had a pretty good gaming career, and there were no Underfoot guild present here. Of course, he was qualified to become a leader of such an undisciplined group of Users.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;We don&apos;t have to speak in length about this. &#xA0;I&apos;ll just lay out the main points.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Big K confidently stood in front of Hyrkan, and he spoke in a sharp manner towards Hyrkan.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;We don&apos;t care about winning this fight. &#xA0;We don&apos;t have the ability to bring this about. We want to catch a decent amount of monsters before we slip away. &#xA0;We don&apos;t care if the Shezga castle falls or not. &#xA0;That is none of our business.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Big K&apos;s words spelled out the group&apos;s intentions in no uncertain terms.</span></p><p><span style="">Those who wanted to win the great battle and successfully defend the castles were with Underfoot guilds already, since they had proven they could win. &#xA0;Moreover, the locations with the Underfoot guilds had Users ranging in number from 3 to 5 thousand. &#xA0;They were overflowing with fighting power, and their chances of defending the castles were quite high.</span></p><p><span style="">At the same time, the monster hunts were very competitive in those locations. &#xA0;There was a sense of achievement in winning, but one couldn&apos;t get a sufficient amount of EXP from those battles.</span></p><p><span style="">On the other hand, the Users that had gathered in number at the Shezga castle was at a location where the downfall of the castle was almost a certainty. However, there was no way there will be a shortage of monsters here. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan knew this truth better than anyone. &#xA0;This was the reason why Hyrkan always went to stages where the odds were stacked.</span></p><p><span style="">If seen that way, Hyrkan was like an icon for defeat. &#xA0;Hyrkan had never moved the needle towards victory in the battles he participated in. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;So you guys are paying a lot of money to play like hyenas, who clamor over rotten meat?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">At that moment, Hyrkan tried another provocation.</span></p><p><span style="">Big K furrowed his eyebrows. In truth, Big K and the Centurions had been considerate to Hyrkan. &#xA0;In the first place, Hyrkan didn&apos;t have the authority to come in here and be so overbearing. &#xA0;If it was any other User, they would have chased him out. &#xA0;They were giving an explanation, because he was the Hahoe Mask.</span></p><p><span style="">However, there was a limit to anything.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hahoe Mask. Aren&apos;t you in the same boat as...&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;The plan is simple. You guys just fight like you had planned before. &#xA0;While you guys are engaged, I&apos;ll attack the Corrupted army from the rear.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;From the rear?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What the hell is he talking about?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Some of the Centurions reflexively protested to Hyrkan&apos;s plan. &#xA0;However, Hyrkan didn&apos;t give a reply to their questions.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I planned on enlisting your help.... &#xA0;However, I don&apos;t need it anymore. &#xA0;By the look of you guys, you guys won&apos;t be of much help to me.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan just continued with what he had to say.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Just don&apos;t interfere with my work. Since you saw the strategy videoes, I hope you can last long enough.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">He turned his back to them.</span></p><p><span style="">A desolate feeling descended, and a person standing at the very edge of this desolate atmosphere yelled out his words.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Are you sure the Hahoe Mask isn&apos;t an 8th grader?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;The Hahoe Mask said that?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">- Yes. </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What happened?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">- The Centurions came to an agreement. &#xA0;We decided to take on a wait and see approach. &#xA0;Anyways, it isn&apos;t as if we can do anything about it. &#xA0;Instead, I had to chase him down to give him the address to the voice talk channel being used by the Centurions.</span></p><p><span style="">Chev had an incredulous expression on his face when he heard Big K&apos;s report. &#xA0;Of course, this was a sound-only communication, so it was impossible for Chev to express what he was feeling through his facial expression.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Honestly, I&apos;m dumbfounded.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Chev used his words to describe what he was feeling.</span></p><p><span style="">- Yes. </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Isn&apos;t this the first time the Hahoe Mask has stepped forward for a fight? &#xA0;Doesn&apos;t that mean there is a chance for victory there?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">He was dumbfounded, but at the same time, he had questions. &#xA0;If one considered what the Hahoe Mask achieved up until now, this was worth paying attention to.</span></p><p><span style="">- He called it Eating the Tail.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Eating the Tail?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">- He said he&apos;ll carry out the Gnawing strategy from the rear of the Corrupted army.</span></p><p><span style="">The instant he heard those words Chev could picture what Hyrkan was talking about. &#xA0;He drew out the strategy, Eating the Tail, inside his mind.</span></p><p><span style="">When he did, Chev&apos;s face once again hardened.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;So that kind of maneuver can be used here.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">When the Corrupted army went into Siege mode, their vision narrowed. &#xA0;The knowledgeable Users were already aware of this fact, and most of the Users in the great battle found out about it when Hyrkan revealed it on his youtube video.</span></p><p><span style="">One could use this fact to laterally attack the Corrupted army. &#xA0;The Gnawing strategy was popular right now.</span></p><p><span style="">Once the Corrupted army moved past the Siege mode, the limited vision would move from the sides to the rear. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">This new strategy would be effective.</span></p><p><span style="">Moreover, the Corrupted army never retreated. &#xA0;The risk of attacking from the rear might actually be less than the risk of attacking from the sides. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">Of course, this strategy hadn&apos;t been verified yet. &#xA0;The result of Hahoe Mask&apos;s battle would bear out if his strategy worked or not.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Why?&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">Chev once again went over the Hahoe Mask&apos;s recent activities.</span></p><p><span style="">The Hahoe Mask worked hard by himself to reap all the benefits by himself. &#xA0;However, Hahoe Mask&apos;s recent pattern of activity had gone through a significant change. &#xA0;He was revealing all the know hows he had been using in the great battle. &#xA0;Moreover, he had come up with a new strategy, and he was about to test it out by himself.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Is he planning on becoming a hero?&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">Chev immediately imagined what would happen if he willed the Shezga castle battle to a victory.</span></p><p><span style="">If one won a battle that was expected to be won, one couldn&apos;t become a hero.</span></p><p><span style="">A hero was someone, who snatched victory from the jaws of defeat. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">If the Hahoe Mask could become a hero, the rights he would command would become very high. </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Good job, Big K.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">- It was nothing.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Then let&apos;s end the call. &#xA0;I have to make an urgent call right now.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">- Understood. </span></p><p><span style="">After the call ended, Chev immediately attempted to call someone. &#xA0;After a brief ringtone, a voice was heard from the other side.</span></p><p><span style="">- Speak. </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;We&apos;ll have to bribe the Hahoe Mask.&#x201D;</span></p>
