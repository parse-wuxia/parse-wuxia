<p><span style="">Chapter 98 - Cursed Domain(2)</span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan stared intently at a large boulder. &#xA0;The boulder didn&apos;t look too special on the outside. &#xA0;In truth, the boulder wasn&apos;t anything special. </span></p><p><span style="">Took took.</span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan used a shovel to dig up the fine soil near the boulder. &#xA0;There would have been no significance to this boulder if an Ingredient Coin hadn&apos;t appeared inside the hole.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Chet.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan clicked his tongue after checking the Ingredient Coin. &#xA0;His expression naturally changed into a sour expression.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;In the end, I&apos;m back to the same location.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">He put the Ingredient Coin back into his pocket. &#xA0;Hyrkan closed his eyes with a frown on his lips.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;I never expected this to turn out like this.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan knew where the Cursed Domain was located at. &#xA0;It was one of the important parts of the Main Scenario Quest, so of course, he knew where it was located at. It was located southeast of Misandra&apos;s Castle, where there was a tall mountain called the Ricky mountain. &#xA0;There was a long winding road past the Ricky mountain, and one had to cross the Inue Lake! One finally reached the boundary of the Cursed Domain after crossing all of those landmarks.</span></p><p><span style="">If one could pinpoint a location to this degree in Warlord, one was basically as knowledgeable as a navigator.</span></p><p><span style="">However, he was currently going around in circles. &#xA0;He couldn&apos;t even get past the Ricky Mountain.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;I had no idea the Block Field was still up. &#xA0;This is really unexpected.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">Block Field. </span></p><p><span style="">No Users could get past this barrier, and it was in the way of Hyrkan.</span></p><p><span style="">The Block Field was placed beyond the Ricky Mountain, and Hyrkan already knew the Block Field hadn&apos;t been dispelled yet. &#xA0;It was something one could confirm through several internet searches.</span></p><p><span style="">Still, he never thought the Block Field would be a problem for him.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;I&apos;ve received the Quest, yet the Block Field is still present... &#xA0;This is a pain.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan had received the Main Scenario Quest. &#xA0;In most cases, the Main Scenario Quest acted as a key in dissolving the Block Field. &#xA0;This was why Hyrkan hadn&apos;t worried over the Block Field. &#xA0;He had been worried about getting to the Cursed Domain faster than everyone else. &#xA0;He wanted to get there first, and he wanted to eat all those delicious Titles.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Some random bastards tried to block my path before and now such a trivial thing is blocking my path.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">Of course, this fact didn&apos;t have all negative connotations.</span></p><p><span style="">Instead, it could be seen as a positive news.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;The fact that the Block Field is around means the Cursed Domain is still intact... &#xA0;It means the Storm Hunters haven&apos;t reached this place yet or they are progressing in a different Quest route as me... &#xA0;I like that.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">The possibility of the Stormhunters guild receiving the same Quest to search for the Cursed Domain, and them being ahead of him was gone. </span></p><p><span style="">It was an element that was sufficiently positive.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;All right.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan let go of his sour mood, and he organized his situation.</span></p><p><span style="">His next task was set. &#xA0;He had to dispel the Block Field. &#xA0;A Block Field couldn&apos;t be dispelled by force.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;It&apos;s been awhile since the Misandra&apos;s Castle was released to the Users. &#xA0;I&apos;m sure the Quests are completed up to a certain point.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan turned his head. &#xA0;First, he had to return to the Misandra Castle. </span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Huh?&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">As if it had been waiting for Hyrkan to turn his head, a monster appeared behind Hyrkan.</span></p><p><span style="">Koo-roo-roo&#x2026;&#x2026;! </span></p><p><span style="">Koo-huhng! Koo-huhng! </span></p><p><span style="">It was a wolf human standing on its two feet. &#xA0;It was a werewolf. &#xA0;It was different from a normal werewolf. &#xA0;It was holding very rusty knives in both hands.</span></p><p><span style="">It was a level 100 monster called Weapon Werewolf. </span></p><p><span style="">Amongst the level 100 mid-sized monsters, it was a monster of average difficulty. &#xA0;It wasn&apos;t hard to kill, but it wasn&apos;t easy to kill either... &#xA0;Basically, it was a middle of the road monster.</span></p><p><span style="">Four of them appeared. &#xA0;At the very least, it was numerous enough where a single User wouldn&#x2019;t be able to easily deal with them.</span></p><p><span style="">However, Hyrkan didn&apos;t even unsheathe his Ivan&apos;s Sword when the pack appeared. &#xA0;He didn&apos;t even snort at their appearance.</span></p><p><span style="">Instead, he flicked his fingers twice.</span></p><p><span style="">This caused the Skeleton Warriors that had been on standby to appear from behind the Weapon Werewolves. &#xA0;They held golden colored swords that looked to be made by smelting gold.</span></p><p><span style="">Kuhng! </span></p><p><span style="">As if they were surprised by the appearance of the Skeletons, the Weapon Werewolves desperately turned their bodies.</span></p><p><span style="">The battle started immediately.</span></p><p><span style="">Kwahng! </span></p><p><span style="">The Werewolves let out a roar as they charged first. The eyes of the Skeleton Warriors and Knight burned as they silently looked at the Werewolves. &#xA0;They dodged the incoming attack, and their fighter&apos;s disposition was strong enough to cut the enemies with a single stroke.</span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan had a sour expression on his face as he opened his Hologram Window. Then he searched for more information.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;No 30 great guilds are present in Misandra&apos;s Domain. &#xA0;There aren&apos;t even Underfoot guilds there. &#xA0;This might be more annoying than I thought it would be. &#xA0;Any ways, what should I have for dinner tonight?&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan was starting to fight battles in a way that was befitting a Necromancer.</span></p><p><span style="">Misandra&apos;s Castle was revealed to the Warlord Users around 2 months ago.</span></p><p><span style="">In the world of gaming, two month was almost like two years. &#xA0;It wasn&apos;t a short amount of time, and a lot of Users had visited Misandra&apos;s Castle. &#xA0;They wanted to dispel the Block Field present beyond the castle. &#xA0;This was why they diligently found and cleared the Quests.</span></p><p><span style="">However, the Block Field would not be easily dispelled. &#xA0;They kept finding likely clues, yet no one could find the actual key.</span></p><p><span style="">In a situation like this, the Users made a simple judgement call.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Oh well. I&apos;ll just go hunt somewhere else.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Well, I&apos;ll only get a single Title if the Block Field is dispelled. &#xA0;Wouldn&apos;t it be more profitable to level up at a different hunting ground?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Give up. </span></p><p><span style="">It was the obvious course of action.</span></p><p><span style="">Not many Users were willing to invest their time here when it hindered with one&apos;s level up.</span></p><p><span style="">Moreover, Misandra&apos;s Castle was located in an ambiguous location.</span></p><p><span style="">One could earn Quests between level 80 to 100 at Misandra&apos;s Castle. The level 80 Users diligently did their Quests, and they diligently leveled up.</span></p><p><span style="">What happens when they reach level 90?</span></p><p><span style="">In Warlord, there was a single goal every users tried to fulfill at level 90. &#xA0;It was to get to level 100 as soon as possible. &#xA0;They wanted to go through the Advancement! &#xA0;If one wanted to go through the Advancement as soon as possible, one had to find an effective hunting ground. Misandra&apos;s Castle was hardly an effective hunting ground, so there was no reason to stay there.</span></p><p><span style="">In the end, the Users left for various parts after they completed Quests up to a certain point.</span></p><p><span style="">New Users influxed into this location, but they repeated the actions of their predecessors.</span></p><p><span style="">Of course, not everyone left.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Does anyone want to do a Quest with me?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Zeet. </span></p><p><span style="">He was different from the other Users. &#xA0;He was part of the minority of people, who was staying behind at Misandra&apos;s Castle for his Quest progress.</span></p><p><span style="">He was level 91, and his Class was Magician.</span></p><p><span style="">As a Magician, he couldn&apos;t operate out in the field by himself. This was why he was gathering party members at Misandra&apos;s Subjugation Association. &#xA0;He was trying to progress in his Quest.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What kind of Quest is it?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;It is an Exploration Quest. It is a Quest to find the remains...&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Does it give a lot of EXP? What&apos;s the Reward?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;It&apos;s an Exploration Quest, so it doesn&apos;t give much EXP nor a lot of rewards.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What for?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">in the end, his recruiting process always ended on a bad note.</span></p><p><span style="">It was the same right now.</span></p><p><span style="">What for?</span></p><p><span style="">After saying that phrase, the User turned around and left as if he never wanted to see Zeet again. The User&apos;s action was so cold that Zeet felt a little bit humiliated.</span></p><p><span style="">Zeet gritted his teeth.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Shit! I should have chosen the Swordsman Class instead... &#xA0;At the very least, I could carry out the quest whether I sink or swim!&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">Zeet manipulated his watch as he spoke. &#xA0;He checked the Quest again.</span></p><p><span style="">[Blackened Remains] </span></p><p><span style="">- Quest Rank : Rare</span></p><p><span style="">- Quest Level Range : 90 </span></p><p><span style="">- Quest Content : Recover the Blackened Remains. Deliver it to the fugitive &apos;Chados&apos;.</span></p><p><span style="">- Quest Reward : Chados&apos; Staff. </span></p><p><span style="">Blackened Remains Quest. </span></p><p><span style="">It was a Rare Rank Quest. It meant it wasn&apos;t an easily obtainable Quest. &#xA0;However, it wasn&apos;t special enough where only Zeet was carrying it out.</span></p><p><span style="">It was actually the opposite. &#xA0;If one was diligently leveling up from level 80 to 90 at Misandra&apos;s Castle, one would receive this Quest. &#xA0;The Quest Route had already been made public.</span></p><p><span style="">However, there was a Quest that was nicknamed the Diploma. &#xA0;When Users received this Quest, a vast majority of them left Misandra&apos;s Castle to search for another hunting ground. &#xA0;It was as if they had graduated from this location. </span></p><p><span style="">There was a reason why Zeet was holding onto this Quest, while he was stalled in leveling up. </span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;I&apos;m sure this Quest is the key that will break open the Block Field.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">Numerous Users went through the Quests available at Misandra&apos;s Castle, and they all reached the Blackened Remains Quest. &#xA0;However, no one had solved the Quest yet.The Block Field remained closed. &#xA0;There was ample reasons why one should be suspicious that this Quest was related to the Block Field.</span></p><p><span style="">Of course, one could be suspicious, but it was hard to have conviction about such a conjecture. Zeet was so sure, because while he was progressing another Quest, he had found the identity of Chados.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Chados is a fugitive. &#xA0;For some reason, he is a fugitive running away from some unfortunate circumstances.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">Chados was a fugitive that had run away from somewhere across the Block Field. &#xA0;He had heard this story from a NPC caretaker named Dodo, who maintenanced the castle walls. &#xA0;Moreover, this truth hadn&apos;t been spread anywhere online. &#xA0;Zeet had never disclosed this information to anyone.</span></p><p><span style="">This was basically Zeet&apos;s trump card.</span></p><p><span style="">He was very sure about his conjecture. &#xA0;He just had to ramp up his efforts in gathering party member. &#xA0;That was the answer.</span></p><p><span style="">The problem was&#x2026;&#x2026;. </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hey, look who it is? &#xA0;Isn&apos;t it, Zeet?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Zeet had a disadvantage that no one else had here.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;You are still operating out of Misandra&apos;s Castle? Huh?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Three Users approached Zeet. &#xA0;The three Users had identical guild emblems on their chests. &#xA0;It was the Swing Guild.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I thought we squared everything last time!&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Swing Guild. </span></p><p><span style="">It was a medium-sized guild with about 300 members. They weren&apos;t considered to be one of the 30 great guilds nor were they part of the Underfoot guilds. They were a guild formed for the purpose of mutual cooperation. &#xA0;The members of the guild consisted of low level Users to pretty high level Users. &#xA0;There were a diverse group of Users gathered in this guild.</span></p><p><span style="">Moreover, they were a guild in bad standing with Zeet.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What did I say? &#xA0;Did I say we&apos;ll smash you to pieces when we find you near the Field?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What a strange bastard. We were just wondering why you were still here. We were just curious!!&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Shit. They should just be transparent with their threats, sons of bitches!&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">It had been a disagreement that happened quite frequently in games.</span></p><p><span style="">They had met up by chance, and they had started a party hunt. &#xA0;They bickered, since they weren&apos;t in sync with each other. &#xA0;The bickering escalated. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">&apos;Why are you so lacking?&apos;</span></p><p><span style="">&apos;Like your mother?&apos;</span></p><p><span style="">As the conversation escalated, feelings were hurt and there was had been an argument.</span></p><p><span style="">Zeet had gotten in a disagreement with a User, and there had been an accident afterwards during the party hunt.</span></p><p><span style="">Zeet was a bit late in his assist, so the User that was playing the role of a Tanker had experienced Game Over.</span></p><p><span style="">It was an accident born out of a mistake, but the aggrieved User felt like it was done on purpose.</span></p><p><span style="">Afterwards, all of Swing guild didn&apos;t see Zeet in a &#xA0;positive light. &#xA0;This was why these Users had spent a long time at Misandra&apos;s Castle, yet they operated far from each other.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Those damn bastards. &#xA0;They aren&apos;t even a 30 great guild, yet... &#xA0;Since I&apos;m alone, they are ganging up on me like a pack of dogs.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">This was the reason why Zeet wasn&apos;t able to aggressively further his agenda. &#xA0;This was why he solicited every new Users he saw to join his party.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Yes. &#xA0;It isn&apos;t that I&apos;m dodging shit, because I&apos;m afraid of it. &#xA0;I&apos;m avoiding it since it is dirty.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">A man appeared in front of Zeet.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Uh?&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">To escape the attention of the Swing Guild, he was about to head out. &#xA0;At that moment, he came face to face with a User at the door.</span></p><p><span style="">He had on a plain armor, and there was a plain sword equipped on his waist. &#xA0;The impression the User gave off.....</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;He has a really gullible face.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">The User really looked like someone that could be tricked.</span></p><p><span style="">In a flash, Zeet&apos;s eyes checked the other User&apos;s Item setting.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Swordsman Class!&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">At a glance, this User obviously had a setting common to the Swordsman Class. Zeet reflexively asked the man a question.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Are you perhaps here to receive a Quest?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">The User silently nodded his head.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Then would you like to do a Quest with me?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Zeet spoke the next part with a low voice.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;This is a secret, but the Block Field might open if this Quest is completed.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">He wouldn&apos;t have made that comment about the Block Field to Normal Users, but the man in front of him looked as if he would fall for anything... &#xA0;He felt this was a chance that would never come again, so he had thrown out the bait.</span></p><p><span style="">As if Zeet&apos;s bait had taken hold, the User looked at Zeet with an interested expression on his face.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;If it isn&apos;t true, how much are you going to give me?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">However, the words and tone of his voice didn&apos;t indicate he was interested. &#xA0;The other User continued to speak.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;If I complete the Quest and the Block Field is still up, how much compensation are you going to give me?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">He was most definitely a pushover, but it seemed Zeet had met someone with a real tiger&apos;s mouth. </span></p>
