<p>Chapter 179 &#x2013; Hero Slaughterer (2)</p><p><span style="">5.</span></p><p><span style="">Heaven helps those who helps themselves.</span></p><p><span style="">&apos;As expected, the surest way to accomplish something is to have the heavens on my side.&apos;</span></p><p><span style="">This idiom was like an immutable truth to Heh-bibin, and he felt the meaning of the words in his bones.</span></p><p><span style="">&apos;I never expected this to work out so well.&apos;</span></p><p><span style="">The Big Smiles guild members attacked and killed Whistling, who had been hunting inside the Highwood Forest. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">It was done openly, so no one could deny it had happened. &#xA0;They were very thorough in eliminating the Pitbull.</span></p><p><span style="">If one looked at it form a gains and losses perspective, one would have a hard time saying the Big Smiles guild had gained anything from this.</span></p><p><span style="">The immediate concern for the guild was to come up with a method to deal with the Hydra guild. &#xA0;It would be great if it ended in a war of words, but if the problem worsened, they might have to prepare for a war. &#xA0;The act of killing Pitbull had angered the Hydra guild. &#xA0;Nothing profitable would come from facing a red-faced opponent.</span></p><p><span style="">However, a significant number of Big Smiles guild members were supportive of the Users, who had cost the bottomline of Big Smiles guild. &#xA0;They had cheered at learning the decision, action and the execution that had went into killing Pitbull.</span></p><p><span style="">Moreover, the ones that participated in the hunt of Pitbull didn&#x2019;t hide their actions. &#xA0;They were &#xA0;unapologetic.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Whistling hunted in a Big Smiles guild territory without our permission. &#xA0;He is basically a thief. &#xA0;I just chased out a thief from my house.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;We&#x2019;d rather have people curse at Big Smiles guild rather than the guild being the butt of everyone&#x2019;s joke.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;We willingly accept any punishment from the guild. &#xA0;However, we don&#x2019;t think we did anything wrong.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">There had been 11 of them.</span></p><p><span style="">Eleven members had participated in the Pitbull hunt, and they had achieved hero status for their actions amongst the normal Big Smiles guild members.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Still, I never expected the discontent amongst the members to be this high.&apos;</span></p><p><span style="">Basically, the discontent within the guild had reached a boiling point.</span></p><p><span style="">After Sinclair&#x2019;s exploits, the Big Smiles guild&#x2019;s standing kept increasing. &#xA0;When they started out at the Black Continent, the Five Stars threatened the name of Top Three. &#xA0;The Big Smiles guild was one of the pillars of this organization.</span></p><p><span style="">At the time, Big Smiles&#x2019; live channel increased in viewership, and they had reached new highs in terms of profits from the sponsors. &#xA0;It was the proof of their success.</span></p><p><span style="">However, after Hahoe Mask&#x2019;s Anugas Raid, Big Smiles guild&#x2019;s standing started to drop. &#xA0;Now their standings wasn&#x2019;t so different from what it was before they joined the Five Stars guild. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">This damaging result accelerated when the Highwood Forest, which was the main hunting ground of the Big Smiles guild, was allowed to become the playground of the Hahoe Mask.</span></p><p><span style="">There had been side effects to the Hahoe Mask&#x2019;s actions. &#xA0;It was getting harder to control their hunting ground. &#xA0;Other Users were starting to follow after the Hahoe Mask&#x2019;s actions. &#xA0;The Big Smiles guild started becoming an entity no one feared.</span></p><p><span style="">&apos;The only thing left is to see what the Hydra guild chooses to do.&apos;</span></p><p><span style="">The discontent was simmering to a boiling point.</span></p><p><span style="">Depending on what the Hydra guild chose to do, this could be an explosive situation. &#xA0;It&#x2019;ll come to a head at some point.</span></p><p><span style="">If the situation becomes explosive, the ones in charge of the guild would suffer heavy damages. &#xA0;In recent days, Heh-bibin didn&#x2019;t have a voice in how the guild was being run. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">Of course, this situation wouldn&#x2019;t cause Heh-bibin any headaches.</span></p><p><span style="">&apos;This is the best.&apos;</span></p><p><span style="">Of course, he was forgetting about the irresistible force called the Hahoe Mask&#x2026;.</span></p><p><span style="">6.</span></p><p><span style="">Normally, a 10 man party was formed for a Wood Devil hunt. &#xA0;There was an odd quirk to these parties. &#xA0;Over half of the 10 man party was either a Striker or a Swordsman.</span></p><p><span style="">At the lowest, there were five Swordsman in the 10 man party. &#xA0;At most, one could see seven Swordsman in a party.</span></p><p><span style="">There were two big reasons why this was the case.</span></p><p><span style="">It was impossible for Tankers to block the Wood Devil.</span></p><p><span style="">The Wood Devil&#x2019;s attack pattern was simple. &#xA0;&#xA0;It swung its arm like a whip or it brought down it arm like a hammer. &#xA0;The attack pattern was simple, yet the power behind the attacks was terrifying. &#xA0;Even if the highest level Tanker with decent equipments and buffs tried to block the attack, one wouldn&#x2019;t be able to withstand a direct hit from the Wood Devil.</span></p><p><span style="">The Tankers wouldn&#x2019;t be able to use their usual methods to block the attacks.</span></p><p><span style="">So what could one do against the Wood Devil?</span></p><p><span style="">One had to defeat the Wood Devil at its own game. &#xA0;The only thing a Tanker could do was to lure and dodge attacks in front of the Wood Devil.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Chen is down&#xFF01;&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Shit! &#xA0;I&#x2019;ll pull the Aggro.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Then I&#x2019;ll save Chen.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Accidents always happened, so the party had to have a contingency plan. The Tanker was needed as a pinch-hitter. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">This was the Tanker&#x2019;s only role. &#xA0;This was why there were so many Swordsman or Strikers compared to the other classes.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Stop attacking! &#xA0;Stop the attack Cicadas!&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">The other reason for having so many Strikers was the method in which damage was given to the Wood Devil.</span></p><p><span style="">The Wood Devil had a high magical defence. &#xA0;If one wanted to lower the magical defense, Armor Breaking was needed. &#xA0;&#xA0;The Wood Devil did not wear any defensive gear. &#xA0;It also didn&#x2019;t have any skin or bark, which could act as an armor. &#xA0;The Wood Devil&#x2019;s enormous body was just a mixture of rocks, dirt and trees. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">This was why the Strikers were needed to dislodge these rocks, and this was akin to Armor Breaking work. &#xA0;Since one needed a lot of work to pull off this Armor Break, one needed more Users working on the project. &#xA0;This was why Strikers were more desired than the Magicians or Tankers. &#xA0;These Strikers were nicknamed as the Cicadas.</span></p><p><span style="">The singing of the Cicadas came to an end. &#xA0;They couldn&#x2019;t attack until the Aggro landed on the Tanker.</span></p><p><span style="">Koohng!</span></p><p><span style="">The Cicadas started to move once again when the Wood Devil was lured by the new Tanker. &#xA0;The Wood Devil was bring down both its arm in an attempt to crush the Tanker with one blow.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;All right. &#xA0;The pinch-hitter was successful.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Start it up again, Cicadas!&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">The Strikers once again latched onto the Wood Devil&#x2019;s body, and they started excavating the stones.</span></p><p><span style="">During all of this, the Priests healed anyone at death&#x2019;s door with Healing Skill. &#xA0;At the same time, the Users with their Buffs expired came to get a full tank of gas again. &#xA0;The Priests worked to restore the Buffs.</span></p><p><span style="">Everything was somewhat going to plan when an unexpected variable butted in.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Do you mind if I ask you a question?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">The question came out of nowhere towards the Priest, who was calculating his Buff Skill Cooldown. &#xA0;The Priest turned his head. &#xA0;There wasn&#x2019;t a single ounce of suspicion inside the Priest&#x2019;s head.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;What question? &#xA0;Speak.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">The Priest thought the question had been asked by a comrade. &#xA0;It would be strange if it was someone other than his comrade especially in this situation. &#xA0;Anyone in his shoes would have made the same assumption. </span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Ah. &#xA0;It isn&#x2019;t a difficult question.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">When the Priest turned his head, he became frightened at what he saw.</span></p><p><span style="">&apos;Huhk&#xFF01;&apos;</span></p><p><span style="">He was so surprised that sound refused to come out of this throat.</span></p><p><span style="">The User, who had asked him a question, wore a Hahoe Mask. &#xA0;It was the scariest mask in Warlord, and the User in armor spoke in a friendly manner.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;My friend was PKed here by fucking assholes. &#xA0;I&#x2019;m here for revenge, and I&#x2019;m looking for the culprits.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Ha...ha...Hahoe&#x2026;.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The Priest was so shocked that words weren&#x2019;t coming out of his mouth. &#xA0;Hyrkan continued to speak.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I&#x2019;m sorry for interfering with your hunt, but I&#x2019;m in a hurry. &#xA0;Anyways, let me show you what my friend looks like. &#xA0;He&#x2019;s the one who was PKed.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">As he spoke, Hyrkan took out a sheet of paper, and he raised it in front of the Priest&#x2019;s nose. &#xA0;It wasn&#x2019;t a drawing of a person. &#xA0;It was a picture of a famous fighting dog called a Pitbull Terrier. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;He&#x2019;s not the type to be pushed around. &#xA0;However, in a bout of bad luck, he was beaten and killed. &#xA0;He couldn&apos;t do anything, since his opponents roamed in a party that numbered &#xA0;around ten Users. &#xA0;This is why I&#x2019;m trying to hunt them down with my group.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan turned to look backwards. &#xA0;There were 30 Skeleton Warriors a good distance away. &#xA0;They looked like they were ready to rush their enemies. &#xA0;Hyrkan turned back to look at the Priest.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Anyways, I&#x2019;m looking for the bastards, who attacked my friend. &#xA0;I don&#x2019;t know their identities nor do I know what they look like. &#xA0;My friend is prideful, so he won&#x2019;t tell me what I want to know. &#xA0;Ah!!&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">At that moment, Hyrkan acted as if he had an epiphany. &#xA0;He lightly poked at the Priest&#x2019;s left chest with his finger. &#xA0;The Priest backed up in fright. &#xA0;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan spoke to the Priest as he laughed.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;For your information, those bastards had the same emblem as the one on your chest. &#xA0;They had that ridiculous smiley face on them. &#xA0;So do you think will be able to tell me their identities? &#xA0;You look like someone, who might know the answer.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;It&#x2019;s the Hahoe Mask!&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">At that moment, the name Hahoe Mask swept through the battlefield. &#xA0;The name was spoken not by the Priest in front of Hyrkan. &#xA0;It was the other Priest. &#xA0;When his name was spoken, everyone turned their gazes towards him.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Hahoe Mask?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Crazy&#x2026;&#x2026;!&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">The ones, who had the luxury of being able to turn their attention away from the battle, focused on the Hahoe Mask.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;What? What&#x2019;s going on?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Did you say it was the Hahoe Mask? &#xA0;We are being attacked by him right now?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">The Users, who couldn&#x2019;t afford to look away, asked questions as they felt a bout of anxiety.</span></p><p><span style="">Moreover, they weren&#x2019;t the only ones, who reacted to the name of the Hahoe Mask.</span></p><p><span style="">- Hahoe Mask? Hahoe Mask made an appearance there?&#x2003;</span></p><p><span style="">- Support! Send support!</span></p><p><span style="">- Where?</span></p><p><span style="">The Level Up support team was helping this party, so they were receiving a live update. &#xA0;When the Level Up support team received the information, they were taken aback.</span></p><p><span style="">He kept looking at the frozen Priest as he spoke.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I just wanted to question you in a quiet manner. &#xA0;I&#x2019;m sorry for intruding on your hunt. &#xA0;I&#x2019;m really sorry.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Of course, there wasn&#x2019;t an ounce of contrition behind his words. &#xA0;Hyrkan&#x2019;s words sounded playful, but his lips didn&#x2019;t even twitch upwards.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I guess you are too busy with the hunt to talk. &#xA0;I&#x2019;ll return after you finish your hunt.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Even now the guild members didn&apos;t dare to surround Hyrkan. &#xA0;They didn&#x2019;t even attempt it.</span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan turned his head to look at the battlefield. &#xA0;The Wood Devil was causing a big ruckus, but the Big Smiles guild members just stared at him. &#xA0;When he turned to look at them again, they flinched in surprise.</span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan held the piece of paper in his hand, and he showed them the drawing of a Pitbull Terrier.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;This is my friend. &#xA0;If you know, who PKed my friend, you should tell me&#x2026;.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Koo-oohng, kooh-oohng!</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Ooh-ahk. &#xA0;Shit!&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">At that moment, a Tanker fell. &#xA0;The User was nailed to the ground by the Wood Devil&#x2019;s fist. &#xA0;The User let out a scream for help.</span></p><p><span style="">However, his guild mates ignored his cry for help as they kept staring at Hyrkan.</span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan spoke to them.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;You can give those bastards a message. &#xA0;I&#x2019;ll put all of you guys into the slaughter house.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">It was a declaration of war.</span></p><p><span style="">Four Golems appeared. &#xA0;They were of Earth, Fire, Ice and Steel. &#xA0;They were imposing, and they were sent towards the 10 Big Smiles guild members.</span></p><p><span style="">As if he wasn&#x2019;t satisfied with this, the Skeleton Warriors appeared from between the enormous legs of the Golems. &#xA0;They attacked the Users.</span></p><p><span style="">Of course, the Users fought back.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Mega Flare!&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">The Magician attacked the Golem with a powerful magical spell.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Shield Crush&#xFF01;&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Gwah-ahng!</span></p><p><span style="">The Tankers used their Shields to send the Skeleton Warriors flying.</span></p><p><span style="">Kah-ahng, kah-ahng!</span></p><p><span style="">The Strikers fought a fierce battle with the Skeleton Warriors. &#xA0;Weapons clashed, and damage started to appear on armors on both sides.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Buff! &#xA0;Buff!&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Wait a minute!&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">The Priest&#x2019;s desperately tried to douse the fire.</span></p><p><span style="">It was a bedlam. &#xA0;Outside of this pandemonium, a private battle was occurring.</span></p><p><span style="">A man &#xA0;was wearing a tattered armor with the Big Smiles guild logo. &#xA0;He had lost his helmet, and his face was revealed. &#xA0;His face was marked with wounds from a sword.</span></p><p><span style="">The User looked to be in rough shape as he lay spread eagle on the floor. &#xA0;A pillar-like leg was pressing down on the User&#x2019;s chest, so he was unable to get up. &#xA0;He was completely subdued.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Cheap bastard. &#xA0;You threw sand in a one on one battle!&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">The User&#x2019;s mouth was the only thing he was able to flap.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;When did I say I won&#x2019;t spray sand? &#xA0;I said I won&#x2019;t use any Skills. &#xA0;Anyways, aren&#x2019;t you going to force a logout??&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">At the User&#x2019;s words, Hyrkan replied in a composed manner.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;You son of a bitch. &#xA0;We wouldn&#x2019;t have killed Pitbull if we weren&#x2019;t prepared to face you.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan smiled instead of getting mad.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;So why didn&#x2019;t you guys attack me? &#xA0;Huh? &#xA0;Were you guys scared of me? &#xA0;Did you guys attack Pitbull because he was less scary?&quot; </span></p><p><span style="">&quot;You provoked us first!&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;If someone heard you, one would think our relationship soured only recently.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan spoke as he stabbed at the User&#x2019;s chest with his sword. &#xA0;The sword slipped in deep between the already crumbling armor. &#xA0;The User didn&#x2019;t scream, since he felt no pain.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Weren&#x2019;t we on bad terms even before we crossed the Urugal mountain range? &#xA0;Now that I think about it, you guys tried fuck me over in the Anugas Raid. &#xA0;Did you participate in that?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I&#x2019;ll get my revenge soon. &#xA0;We&#x2019;ll do to you what we did to Pitbull.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">At those words, Hyrkan pull out the sword, and he stabbed down again. &#xA0;The repeated stab made the User&#x2019;s HP drop to zero. &#xA0;After finishing his work, he turned to look at his Golems, Skeleton Warriors and the Big Smiles guild members.</span></p><p><span style="">At that moment, Hyrkan gave an order. &#xA0;The Golems and the Skeleton Warriors, who were relentlessly attacking, stopped. </span></p><p><span style="">&quot;What?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;What&#x2019;s going on?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">A clap needed two palms to strike each other. &#xA0;When the Skeleton Warriors and Golems stopped their attack, the Big Smiles guild members also stopped their attack. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">When this sudden peace arrived, Hyrkan walked as he spoke.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I&#x2019;m sorry for interrupting your hunt. &#xA0;A User, who was in your hunting party, was killed by me. &#xA0;It was a personal matter. &#xA0;The rest of you can continue your hunt. &#xA0;Please enjoy yourselves, and I wish you luck on gaining good drops.&quot; </span></p><p><span style="">As he spoke, Hyrkan spoke with the most contemptible and nasty smile full of ridicule on his face.</span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan had started his work to catch the big giant.</span></p>
