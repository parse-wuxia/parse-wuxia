<p><span style="">Chapter 162 - Anugas&#x2019; Necklace (1)</span></p><p>1.</p><p><span style="">[Anugas&apos; Power is fading away.] </span></p><p><span style="">[Your soul has regained its original strength.] </span></p><p><span style="">The Crying Sword thrust forward by Hyrkan pierced Anugas&apos; gem-like eye. &#xA0;It even pierced through its enormous head.</span></p><p><span style="">At that moment, the Announcement was heard within his ears. &#xA0;It informed him that he had won this perilous battle.</span></p><p><span style="">It was basically the news of his victory. &#xA0;Afterwards, Hyrkan heard the praise given only to the victor.</span></p><p><span style="">[The souls taken by Anugas was saved.] </span></p><p><span style="">[You&apos;ve gained the Title &apos;Rescuer of Heard Fortress&apos; Souls.&apos;] </span></p><p><span style="">[You&apos;ve gained the Title &apos;Reclaimer of the Heard Fortress.&apos;] </span></p><p><span style="">[You&apos;ve gained the Title &apos;Destroyer of Anugas.&apos;] </span></p><p><span style="">[The Quest &apos;Visit the Blacksmith Olf&apos; has started] </span></p><p><span style="">The consecutive praise was heard through Hyrkan&apos;s ears, and it hammered away inside his head.</span></p><p><span style="">While this was going on, Anugas&apos; body started to smoke, and it started to melt into a sticky liquid. &#xA0;Hyrkan detached himself from Anugas&apos; body.</span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan&apos;s expression hadn&#x2019;t changed. &#xA0;It hadn&apos;t changed as he heard the consecutive Announcements in his ears.</span></p><p><span style="">[Your Level has increased.] </span></p><p><span style="">The Level Up Announcement was what caused Hyrkan&apos;s expression to change.</span></p><p><span style="">When he heard the announcement, Hyrkan raised his head. On the right edge of his vision, he could see a mirage-like blue gauge. &#xA0;He checked the magic status window.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Magic recovery... &#xA0;Ok.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">Until a moment ago, there hadn&apos;t been a single iota of blue light present on the magic status window, but now it was full. &#xA0;It was shining like a blue bulb.</span></p><p><span style="">Of course, the timing of his Level Up was planned out by Hyrkan too. &#xA0;He estimated how much EXP he would gain when he caught Anugas, and he hunted until he would immediately level up when he killed Anugas.</span></p><p><span style="">This wasn&apos;t a strategy often used by Users, but it was a well known method. &#xA0;It was a method used to recover health and magic during a hunt... &#xA0;Anyways, the Level Up Bonus was more effective than any magic recovery Items in his arsenal.</span></p><p><span style="">Moreover, at that moment, the Level Up Bonus was more important to him than any other time in this game. </span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Restoration.... &#xA0;Ok.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">When Hyrkan recovered his magical energy, he started mending his Skeleton Warriors and Skeleton Knights. &#xA0;The fractured bones started to mend, and the Skeletons, who weren&apos;t able to move, could move again.</span></p><p><span style="">[The Special Ability &apos;Undying&apos; has activated.] </span></p><p><span style="">Then he activated the Special Ability of the Death Knight. &#xA0;There were Skeletons that were too damaged that they would revert back into being Skeleton Fragments if left alone for several minutes. &#xA0;These Skeleton Warriors were quickly regaining their shape under the Undying skill of the Death Knight. &#xA0;They stood on their own two feet in an imposing manner.</span></p><p><span style="">He retained 15 Skeleton Warriors, 3 Skeleton Knights and a Death Knight.</span></p><p><span style="">These 19 Skeletons were veteran heroes. &#xA0;It took them only 1 minute to regain their imposing figures. &#xA0;They were letting out breathes full of frost.</span></p><p><span style="">After the Skeleton army regained their dignified appearance, they created a perimeter around Anugas, and Hyrkan stood in the middle of this imposing group.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hoo-ooh!&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan let out a sigh. &#xA0;It contained many mixed emotions. &#xA0;After putting his sword into his sheath, he raised his left arm. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">Ggee-reek, ggee-reek.</span></p><p><span style="">The short sound of the dial turning on his wristwatch was heard.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Slot on.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">After the sound ended, Hyrkan punctuated it with his low words. &#xA0;Accompanying his words, a striking silver armor with black spots started to surround Hyrkan&apos;s body. &#xA0;In 3 seconds, Hyrkan took on the form that was most familiar to the other Users. &#xA0;He changed into his strongest form.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;It take about 3 to 5 minutes for Anugas&apos; eye to turn into its Ingredient form.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">He had killed Anugas.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;I caught it, so I can&apos;t lose out on this.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan prepared himself for battle. &#xA0;He was now going to protect the prey he had killed from the &#xA0;other Users.</span></p><p>2.</p><p><span style="">- Hahoe Mask was successful in his Raid.</span></p><p><span style="">When Shir received the report, a sea of fire was unfurled in front of her. &#xA0;It reminded one of hell.</span></p><p><span style="">Zzuh-juhk! </span></p><p><span style="">The flames continued to burn, and the gigantic trees split open. &#xA0;They had been barely holding their shape against the heat. &#xA0;The trees let out dull sounds, which sounded like screams. &#xA0;No other sound could be heard. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">Shir swung her sword in a wide arc.</span></p><p><span style="">Shweek! </span></p><p><span style="">A crescent sword energy burning with intense flame was emitted when she swung her sword.</span></p><p><span style="">Hwah-roo-roo! </span></p><p><span style="">The sword energy pushed itself forward as if it was a flood. &#xA0;Devastation could be seen trailing behind the road made out of fire.</span></p><p><span style="">She had combined the Crescent Cut and the Ancient Power of Flame. &#xA0;It looked flashy, and its power was terrifying. &#xA0;The large trees and boulders, which had been barely holding onto their original form, was cut down.</span></p><p><span style="">This was a raging inferno.</span></p><p><span style="">After creating the devastating sight in front of her, Shir turned her back against it. &#xA0;If the Users wanted to chase after her, they would have to go through the fiery hell she had created.</span></p><p><span style="">When Shir took couple more steps, her subordinates gathered around her. The first one to speak was Hahui. &#xA0;She respected Shir more than anyone else here.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;The Poker team is quick to run away. &#xA0;Their talent for running away isn&apos;t normal. &#xA0;It is as if they had practiced running away before. &#xA0;If they had stuck around, I&apos;m sure I could have taken all of them down.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">It seemed Hahui was feeling guilty. &#xA0;She hadn&#x2019;t been able succeed in the mission given to her. &#xA0;As always, Hahui brought up words that would deflect away from her actions. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">However, Shir just spoke briefly to Hahui.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Good job.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes!&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Hahui put on a bright smile.</span></p><p><span style="">- I&apos;ve caught around 70 of them. &#xA0;I think I took down around 50 magicians. &#xA0;They were all bunched together, so it was quite easy to kill them. &#xA0;Of course, this mission would have been impossible if it wasn&apos;t for me.</span></p><p><span style="">Hatch butted in on the conversation. &#xA0;It wasn&apos;t a coincidence. &#xA0;Of course, he hadn&apos;t overheard the conversation through Voice Talk by accident, and his words were calculated.</span></p><p><span style="">- I was able to perform admirably unlike someone.</span></p><p><span style="">Of course, he spoke his words to needle Hahui. &#xA0;Hahui&apos;s expression cooled. &#xA0;She didn&apos;t know about anything else, but she couldn&apos;t let Hatch get the better of her. &#xA0;However, she couldn&apos;t come up with any words. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">Hahui&apos;s body shook, and if Hatch was in front of her, her fist would already be planted in his face.</span></p><p><span style="">The most galling part was the fact that she knew Hatch knew this, and this was why he was needling her from afar. &#xA0;In many ways, Hatch was the most cautious member of the Stormhunters.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Good job.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Shir also spoke plainly to Hatch.</span></p><p><span style="">- Yes. </span></p><p><span style="">Instead of coming up with more words to make fun of Hahui, Hatch gave a short answer.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;We&apos;ll head towards the Ravine.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Their mission hadn&apos;t ended yet.</span></p><p><span style="">The battle had ended.</span></p><p><span style="">However, the game hadn&apos;t ended yet.</span></p><p>3.</p><p><span style="">- What should we do? </span></p><p><span style="">- What happened to the Diamond unit? </span></p><p><span style="">- We lost three. The rest escaped towards the back. &#xA0;What should we do? &#xA0;Should we meet up with additional troops for a head on confrontation with the Stormhunters?</span></p><p><span style="">- Where&apos;s our support troops? </span></p><p><span style="">- We are on the move. &#xA0;Give us 20 minutes.</span></p><p><span style="">- I think it&apos;ll take us longer to get there.</span></p><p><span style="">- The damage to the normal Users was much larger than the damage to the Diamond unit. &#xA0;Ballista&apos;s magic took out close to 50 Magicians. &#xA0;This is a loss that can&apos;t be glossed over.</span></p><p><span style="">- We couldn&apos;t even track down Ballista. &#xA0;That man basically became untouchable once he learned the Blizzard Shooting Star.</span></p><p><span style="">- So what? &#xA0;We should do nothing?</span></p><p><span style="">Sinclair frowned when endless chatter poured out of the Voice Talk.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Shit!&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">He had crumpled his face so much that it seemed impossible to frown any further. &#xA0;However, he did just that.</span></p><p><span style="">His face looked deformed. &#xA0;Sinclair made a face that he dared not show anyone else as he let out his annoyance.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;I&apos;ve never seen a mess of this scale.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">Sinclair decided not to worry over it. &#xA0;It wasn&apos;t a problem that could be solve by him worrying over it. &#xA0;This problem had ballooned beyond his capability. </span></p><p><span style="">The problem they faced was simple. Hahoe Mask had attempted the Anugas Raid, and the Stormhunters guild had helped the Hahoe Mask. &#xA0;This meant their opponents were pretty sure they could succeed in the Anugas Raid, and these two forces had allied themselves.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;I put in one redundancy after another, yet none of them are working. &#xA0;What more could be done?&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">The problem was the fact that they had already formulated an answer to this problem. &#xA0;This was why a thousand of their troops were sent to the Heard Fortress. &#xA0;They were sent to interfere. &#xA0;They also put in contingency plan that dealt with either the Stormhunters guild or the Hahoe Mask. &#xA0;They had prepared a mobile unit called the Diamond unit to deal with them.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Instead of the Diamond unit, we should have brought the entire Poker team. &#xA0;Every member of the Hands guild should have been gathered here.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">However, their contingency plan had failed. &#xA0;The Storm Queen had gathered her elite members, and she had turned the table on them. &#xA0;She had hunted down the Diamond unit. &#xA0;The Diamond unit was supposed to delay any groups they met for 10 minutes, yet they weren&apos;t even able to pull that off. &#xA0;The Storm Queen was also a possessor of the Deposed Prince&apos;s Sword, and she possessed the Ancient Power of Flame.</span></p><p><span style="">Basically, they had a problem, and they had put forth an answer. &#xA0;However, the answer wasn&apos;t working. </span></p><p><span style="">This was it.</span></p><p><span style="">There was no point in them agonizing over the solution. &#xA0;The wise thing to do was to wash their hands of this debacle </span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;If this was the previous Hands guild, we could have taken out our enemies no matter what the cost. &#xA0;In the past, a single order was enough to gather everyone.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">Sinclair&apos;s annoyance started from this fact.</span></p><p><span style="">Hands guild.</span></p><p><span style="">The Hands guild operated under the notice of the world, and death in battle used to be an acceptable option. &#xA0;If needed, everyone would die to further their agenda. &#xA0;No one would have been averse to it. &#xA0;Even in death, they would have dragged down the enemies by their ankles. &#xA0;There would have been reward and benefit that would drive the Hands guild Users to make this sacrifice.</span></p><p><span style="">If everything operated like the past, they would have considered a suicidal death with the Storm Queen to be a great opportunity. &#xA0;The forces needed to take down the Storm Queen would have been gathered without any fuss. &#xA0;If the Hands guild needed them, they would have gathered in a single location to become a chess piece on the board.</span></p><p><span style="">However, things weren&apos;t like that any more.</span></p><p><span style="">The members, who had originated from the Hands guild, were starting to enjoy the spotlight. &#xA0;They had too much to lose if they weren&apos;t able to enter the game for 48 hours. &#xA0;One couldn&apos;t lose something, one didn&apos;t have. &#xA0;However, they now had something to lose, and it was a bitter feeling to lose what they possessed. &#xA0;This was why they weren&apos;t able to mobilize on command. &#xA0;Power and rank had become shackles.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;This will allow the Hahoe Mask and the Stormhunters to take a step forward further away from us.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">Their body was getting bigger.</span></p><p><span style="">They were becoming more powerful.</span></p><p><span style="">Their opulence was getting larger.</span></p><p><span style="">However, they were becoming slow and sluggish. </span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;If we want to block them, we have to put our life on the line. &#xA0;We have to be prepared to take them down with us.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">At that moment, Sinclair clicked his tongue from the bitterness he felt.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;It&apos;s all right. &#xA0;Let&apos;s just take a step back.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">He couldn&apos;t keep his bitterness out of his voice. &#xA0;He spat out his words.</span></p><p><span style="">- What are you saying? </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Let&apos;s leave a portion of our forces behind. &#xA0;They can follow behind the Stormhunters guild, and they could monitor the Heard Fortress. &#xA0;Even if we stake everything on this single die cast, it isn&apos;t as if we&apos;ll gain a solution. &#xA0;What happens if the Stormhunters guild runs away?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">- We&apos;ll just drive them towards the Heard Fortress....</span></p><p><span style="">- No. &#xA0;Sinclair is correct. &#xA0;If the Hahoe Mask has caught Anugas, there is a high probability of the Block Field beyond the Heard Fortress dissolving. &#xA0;Then there would be no point in driving them towards the Heard Fortress.</span></p><p><span style="">- Then we should just overlook our losses? &#xA0;If we end this business here, we&apos;ll look like idiots.</span></p><p><span style="">- Do we have a viable plan? &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">- We have to find a way! </span></p><p><span style="">The Voice Talk channel showed signs of becoming loud again. &#xA0;Sinclair became annoyed again. &#xA0;This was why he deliberately took a breath to calm himself down. He used his acting skill to make his voice sound calm.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;The only thing we can do now is to sacrifice several members to grab the ankles of the Stormhunters or the Hahoe Mask. &#xA0;We don&apos;t have any other answers beyond that option. &#xA0;If we have volunteers, who are willing to become sacrifices, I&apos;ll gladly help with the plan. &#xA0;For your information, it&apos;ll take me 3 hours to arrive there.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">No one had an answer to those words.</span></p><p><span style="">No one wanted to become the sacrifice. &#xA0;At that moment, Sinclair spoke into the Voice Talk channel.</span></p><p><span style="">He couldn&apos;t hold back his bitter words anymore.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;In the past, we fought through fire and water. &#xA0;Now we are all busy worrying about our own hides.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">He spat out the bitter words.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Fuck&#xB7;&#xB7;&#xB7;&#xB7;&#xB7;&#xB7;.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">He was also guilty of doing this.</span></p><p>4.</p><p><span style="">It was a world where a news originating from New York could be spread in 10 seconds around the world.</span></p><p><span style="">- Something big is happening at the Black Continent! </span></p><p><span style="">- &#x3134; What&apos;s going on? </span></p><p><span style="">- &#x3134; Don&apos;t give us bullshit. </span></p><p><span style="">- &#x3134; The Hahoe Mask and the Five Stars are fighting each other! </span></p><p><span style="">Of course, the incident in the Black Continent attracted the fans of Warlord.</span></p><p><span style="">Everyone interested in Warlord was now focused on the Black Continent. &#xA0;The enormous guild alliance called Five Stars was acting with high-handedness in this region. &#xA0;The Black Continent was overflowing with monsters above level 200. &#xA0;The Stormhunters guild and the Hahoe Mask was also there. &#xA0;Then there was the mysterious existence called Anugas. &#xA0;All of these factors attracted attention to the Black Continent.</span></p><p><span style="">It was pretty much impossible to hide events occurring in the Black Continent when everyone&#x2019;s focus was on this region. &#xA0;Of course, this was why no one tried to hide what was going on.</span></p><p><span style="">- Hahoe Mask is conducting the Anugas Raid! </span></p><p><span style="">- &#x3134; What the hell is an Anugas? </span></p><p><span style="">- &#x3134; Anugas is a magic-eating monster. &#xA0;When it appears, all Class Skills become unusable.</span></p><p><span style="">- &#x3134; Wasn&apos;t that a false rumor? &#xA0;There has been no footage released corroborating this fact.</span></p><p><span style="">- &#x3134; I have a friend in the V&amp;V guild. &#xA0;He said it is true.</span></p><p><span style="">The situation was updated in real time online as information was relayed to others.</span></p><p><span style="">- It seems the Stormhunter guild is helping out the Hahoe Mask. &#xA0;My friend is in the Blossoms guild. &#xA0;They went to interfere with the Hahoe Mask, and they are now fighting the Stormhunters guild! </span></p><p><span style="">- &#x3134; My friend is in the V&amp;V guild. &#xA0;He never mentioned anything about this.</span></p><p><span style="">- &#x3134; I&apos;m in the V&amp;V guild. &#xA0;OP is right.</span></p><p><span style="">- &#x3134; My friend is in the Big Smiles guild. &#xA0;He said the Storm Queen and the Hahoe Mask is conducting a Raid, and the Five Stars is helping them.</span></p><p><span style="">- &#x3134; I&apos;m affiliated with the Sweepers guild. &#xA0;We are just hunting right now.</span></p><p><span style="">- &#x3134; I guess all the busy people are on here including the Five Stars and the Stormhunters. &#xA0;If so, I&apos;m the Hahoe Mask, you retards!</span></p><p><span style="">Of course, in the beginning, false stories came out. &#xA0;It took people time to filter out the false rumors. &#xA0;As time passed, the stories that were coming out was getting closer to the truth.</span></p><p><span style="">- Hahoe Mask attempted the Anugas Raid. &#xA0;Five Stars tried to interfere, but they failed. &#xA0;The Stormhunters guild blocked them, and the Five Stars are retreating. &#xA0;It seems the Hahoe Mask has succeeded in the Anugas Raid. &#xA0;FYI, I&apos;m affiliated with the Stormhunters guild.</span></p><p><span style="">- &#x3134; Proof? </span></p><p><span style="">- &#x3134; You should click on the Instagram account linked to my profile.</span></p><p><span style="">- &#x3134; Wow! &#xA0;He is the real deal! &#xA0;Wow! </span></p><p><span style="">Now the stories didn&apos;t have any falsehood mixed in with it. &#xA0;It was as close to the truth as it could get.</span></p><p><span style="">While this was going on...</span></p><p><span style="">Hahoe Mask&apos;s Youtube page was uploaded with a battle footage. &#xA0;It was his fight with the Skull Collector at the the Voodook&apos;s Tunnel.</span></p>
