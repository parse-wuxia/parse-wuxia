<p><span style="">Chapter 154 - Find the Ruins (1)</span></p><p>1.</p><p><span style="">When one entered Voodook&apos;s tunnel, nervousness and fear was usually intermixed with the thick fog. &#xA0;However, when one exits the Voodook&apos;s tunnel, it felt as if all those feelings were let go. &#xA0;This was why when Users exited the Voodook&apos;s tunnel, they looked as if couple screws were loose in their heads.</span></p><p><span style="">However, the six Users that had exited the Voodook&apos;s tunnel right now was different. &#xA0;There wasn&apos;t a single ounce of looseness in their expression or atmosphere. </span></p><p><span style="">Instead, it was quite apparent that a feeling of tension had replaced the looseness. &#xA0;One could feel the tension emanating from them.</span></p><p><span style="">Users were still hanging around the exit of the Voodook&apos;s tunnel for various reason, and they naturally they became curious when they saw the six Users.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;What is up with their expressions?&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Six Users? &#xA0;Did a party member die?&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;They entered with seven. &#xA0;They did above average if six survived. &#xA0;At the very least, two or three people usually die in there.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Wait a moment? &#xA0;I don&apos;t see any traces of a fight.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">If one wanted to survive in Warlord, one had to be quick on the uptake.</span></p><p><span style="">All of the Users here that had caught the Skull Collector and exited Voodook&apos;s tunnel were experts at survival. </span></p><p><span style="">This was why they were suspicious of this new group that had exited. &#xA0;The quick-thinking Users were moving closer to satiate their suspicion.</span></p><p><span style="">However, their doubts were washed away when they saw the final figure that had appeared behind the tense group of 6 party members. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;It&apos;s the Hahoe Mask!&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">The rumors that said the Hahoe Mask was attempting the Urugal mountain range hadn&#x2019;t been spread throughout the world, but the news had spread to most of the Users present at the Urugal mountain range.</span></p><p><span style="">Moreover, the information was precise. &#xA0;If one wanted to find out about it, one could easily dig up when the Hahoe Mask had entered the Voodook&apos;s tunnel.</span></p><p><span style="">This was why the Users in front of the exit of the Voodook&apos; tunnel could quickly make the calculations.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;It took them only 30 minutes to pass through the Voodook&apos;s Tunnel.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;My god. &#xA0;It would take a skilled party one hour to clear it, yet he cut the time in half.....&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;He is monster amongst monsters.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">Voodook&apos;s tunnel took about 1 hour to clear for a skilled party, yet he had come out in 30 minutes. &#xA0;He had cut the time in half. &#xA0;The Users were filled with admiration, jealousy and other emotions. &#xA0;These emotions were infused in their gazes as they headed towards the Hahoe Mask like arrows.</span></p><p><span style="">Of course, the Hahoe Mask wasn&apos;t interested in the other 6 party members any more.</span></p><p><span style="">After observing his surrounding, Hahoe Mask&apos;s gaze headed towards the top of the Urugal mountain range. &#xA0;The Hahoe Mask just stood there staring at the summit, so several Users followed his gaze to see what he was looking at.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Does he plan on catching the owner of the Urugal mountain range?&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Is he really going to do it by himself?&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">At that moment, a different type of tension emanated from the Users.</span></p><p><span style="">The owner of the Urugal mountain range was the Blaze Slime Dragon.</span></p><p><span style="">There were a lot of nicknames attributed to the Blaze Slime Dragon by the Users. &#xA0;Amongst the nicknames, the one that stuck in the head of everyone was the Strongest Boss Monster.</span></p><p><span style="">Of course, this was a controversial topic.</span></p><p><span style="">Was the Frost Knight, which was defeated by the Hahoe Mask, more difficult? &#xA0;Or was the Blaze Slime Dragon, which was defeated by the Stormhunters guild, more difficult to take down? &#xA0;The participants of the Raids were excluded from the discussion as the debate started, and it was surprisingly fierce. &#xA0;People started exchanging numbers that would make an engineer&apos;s eyes spin to support their arguments. &#xA0;At the end of the debate, Blaze Slime Dragon was crowned as being the current Strongest Boss Monster.</span></p><p><span style="">Of course, the Blaze Slime Dragon was hunted down using the full might of the Stormhunters guild, so the Hahoe Mask was seen as the superior player. &#xA0;After the Hahoe Mask and the Stormhunters guild, no Raid team had been successful in taking down the Frost Knight or the Blaze Slime Dragon.</span></p><p><span style="">In such a situation, what would happen if the Hahoe Mask took down the Blaze Slime Dragon? &#xA0;What would this implicate?</span></p><p><span style="">It would be indisputable. &#xA0;The Hahoe Mask would become the strongest existence in Warlord at this current stage.</span></p><p><span style="">He wouldn&apos;t just be equal to the 30 great guilds. &#xA0;He would be seen as being more powerful than the 30 great guilds.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Is he really going to attempt it?&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;If it is the Hahoe Mask.... &#xA0;He&apos;ll be able to do it.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">In the end, it was a very foolhardy thing to do, but there was one person that nonchalantly did the impossible in Warlord. &#xA0;It was the Hahoe Mask.</span></p><p><span style="">Of course, Hyrkan wasn&apos;t going to fulfill their expectations. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan wasn&apos;t looking at the summit of the Urugal mountain for this reason.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;I&apos;m glad I don&apos;t have to catch that bastard.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">Relief. </span></p><p><span style="">Currently, he was thankful for the fact that he could get past the Urugal mountain range without fighting the Blaze Slime Dragon.</span></p><p><span style="">If he had to kill it, he would have done it. &#xA0;The killing of the Blaze Slime Dragon was a must if he wanted to get across the Urugal mountain. &#xA0;However, the Stormhunters guild had killed it, so they had already paved the way for him.</span></p><p><span style="">At the same time, the Stormhunters guild got all the benefit from being the first one to kill the Blaze Slime Dragon. &#xA0;Of course, Hykran would be able to make a lot of money from killing the Blaze slime Dragon by selling various parts. &#xA0;However, the Titles that came with killing it first....</span></p><p><span style="">He wouldn&apos;t be able to gain the Titles like the Dragon Slayer title. &#xA0;On the other hand, he would be able to gain a lot of money from the Raid footage. &#xA0;Then there was the Ingredients that allowed one to make level 200 Unique Items. &#xA0;There were still a lot of potential for profit here.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;It isn&#x2019;t a bad idea to catch it, but there&#x2019;s no need to rush it.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">On the other hand, he would have to take a risk that was as large as the benefits he would gain.</span></p><p><span style="">This wasn&#x2019;t an ordinary risk. &#xA0;&#xA0;This was evident in the fact that 14 teams challenged the Blaze Slime Dragon when it respawned after 10 days. &#xA0;However, none had succeeded in killing the dragon.</span></p><p><span style="">These weren&#x2019;t just mediocre players. &#xA0;These were expert players that had easily gotten past the Skull Collector. &#xA0;&#xA0;Even these types of Users were having a hard time.</span></p><p><span style="">It would be the same for Hyrkan. &#xA0;No, in some ways, the Blaze Slime Dragon was a poor opponent for Hyrkan. &#xA0;Enemies like the Frost Knight was easier for Hyrkan.</span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan was well aware of this fact.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;There&#x2019;s no point in hanging around the entrance.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">Urugal mountain range was a door.</span></p><p><span style="">A door had meaning only if one got past it. &#xA0;The safe itself wasn&#x2019;t the price. &#xA0;It was meaningful only if one obtain what was across the other side of the safe&#x2019;s door.</span></p><p><span style="">This was why Hyrkan started to walk.</span></p><p><span style="">When the Users saw him move, they immediately typed posts online.</span></p><p><span style="">[Hahoe Mask will challenge the Blaze Slime Dragon!] </span></p><p><span style="">A new rumor regarding Hyrkan formed at that moment.</span></p><p>2.</p><p><span style="">When the Stormhunter guild killed the Blaze Slime Dragon, any Users that passed the Voodook&apos;s tunnel could cross the Urugal mountain range.</span></p><p><span style="">The Users were able to reach the land across the Urugal mountain range, and they called this place the Black Continent. &#xA0;&#xA0;They attempted this location wanting to be a trailblazer. &#xA0;&#xA0;The Users were able to earn Items above level 200 here, and they wanted to find new monsters. &#xA0;Then there was the clues regarding the third Main Scenario Quest. &#xA0;They wanted to find a hunting ground that was the land of milk and honey.</span></p><p><span style="">These were the words spoke by these Users.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Shit!&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;We don&apos;t have to to complain. &#xA0;Run!&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;If this wasn&apos;t the Black Continent, I would have stood my ground and fight!&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Just run!&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">The Black Continent was hell.</span></p><p><span style="">The lowest level monsters here were level 200. &#xA0;This land was crawling with level 200 and up monsters, and it was a bit too much for Users that had just reached level 200 not too long ago.</span></p><p><span style="">At the same time, the penalty given to Users from dying was greatly increased in the Black Continent.</span></p><p><span style="">In Warlord, there were various penalties that were given to the Users, but the biggest penalty was being shut out from the game for 48 hours. &#xA0;This penalty was still present.</span></p><p><span style="">However, the Black Continent didn&apos;t have a Restart Point. &#xA0;It was the locations where the Users would respawn.</span></p><p><span style="">If one died here, one would immediately sent back to the other side of the Urugal mountain!</span></p><p><span style="">This was the result of failing here.</span></p><p><span style="">That wasn&apos;t the only problem. &#xA0;There weren&#x2019;t any place to rest here, and there were no markets where one could trade Items. &#xA0;Inevitably, one had to hunt monsters to get ingredients, and one had to make one&#x2019;s own consumable Items. &#xA0;Since no one knew which monsters gave ingredients to magical and health recovery consumables, it was impossible to produce the consumables.</span></p><p><span style="">Basically, this place was hell! </span></p><p><span style="">Of course, if one wanted to survive in &#xA0;hell, one had to become a devil.</span></p><p><span style="">The first group of Users that attempted to become devils were the Stormhunters guild. &#xA0;They were the one that had opened the door to this place.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Currently, we&apos;ve brought over a total of 157 members. &#xA0;We decided to rotate our playing time, so we divided everyone into 4 teams. &#xA0;I sent you the the roster for the 4 teams. &#xA0;I e-mailed it to you yesterday.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">When Shir saw the Hahoe Mask&apos;s Frozen Kingdom movie, she made a bold decision. &#xA0;After finishing their 2nd Advancement, she brought 157 guild members to the Black Continent. </span></p><p><span style="">It hadn&apos;t been an easy feat. There were a lot of tasks that needed to be finished for the Users over level 200. &#xA0;Moreover, the Stormhunters guild possessed a lot of programs on their live channel. &#xA0;If they wanted to broadcast a variety of contents, skilled Users had to be assigned to do a wide range of tasks. </span></p><p><span style="">She had brought most of them here, so for a while, the guild wouldn&apos;t be able to produce meaningful contents. &#xA0;The Stormhunters would suffer huge loss in this process. </span></p><p><span style="">She had made the decision in spite of this. &#xA0;If they wanted to survive in the Black Continent, they needed a force of this size.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I think we&apos;ve located a Dungeon.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">The only thing left was to find a place where they could permanently reside.</span></p><p><span style="">In Warlord, one wasn&apos;t safe just from building a wall or a wooden fence. &#xA0;The most important part was to find a place where monsters didn&apos;t regenerate. &#xA0;This was why towns or castles were used as waypoints for Users.</span></p><p><span style="">However, they hadn&apos;t been able to find such a location in the Black Continent. &#xA0;There weren&apos;t any castles or towns.</span></p><p><span style="">This was why Hatch had come up with the idea of finding a Dungeon.</span></p><p><span style="">Unexpectedly, the Instance Dungeons possessed similar qualities as towns and castles. &#xA0;A good number of Instance Dungeons prevented Regeneration.</span></p><p><span style="">This was an unexpected consequence of a game mechanic they could take advantage of.</span></p><p><span style="">If there were invisible walls that were caging in a pack of wild beasts, one wouldn&#x2019;t be safe standing in front of them. &#xA0;However, the surrounding region would be the safest place to be.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Since we found one, I hope it&apos;s a real Dungeon.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Of course, the best thing for them was to find a real Dungeon instead of an Instance Dungeon. &#xA0;The real Dungeons were single use Dungeons. </span></p><p><span style="">If they could find a single use Dungeon, it would be the end of their search.</span></p><p><span style="">It was as the word implied. &#xA0;The single use Dungeon didn&apos;t regenerate monsters after it was cleared. &#xA0;It was the ultimate shelter.</span></p><p><span style="">Moreover, single use Dungeons were located in hard to find places. &#xA0;Even the monsters would have a hard time finding the location. &#xA0;Basically, it was a fortress bless with natural barriers </span><span style="">for defense.</span></p><p><span style="">If the Stormhunters guild wanted to overtake the Black Continent, they needed such a place.</span></p><p><span style="">Of course, there was someone else here that knew better than anyone as to the benefit of such a location.</span></p><p>3.</p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Where is it? &#xA0;Where is it?&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">A User was busily moving his head from side to side as he looked at his surrounding. &#xA0;Hyrkan yelled out when he caught sight of a golden glint.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;There it is! &#xA0;Catch it!&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">As if reacting to his words, the Skeleton Warriors in the surrounding started to move. &#xA0;Hyrkan also started running towards this golden being.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;You son of a bitch! &#xA0;I&apos;ll catch you this time no matter what!&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">It had been two days since he had climbed over the peak of the Urugal mountain range.</span></p><p><span style="">The world was waiting for Hyrkan to catch the Slime Dragon for the past two days, but Hyrkan was actually using his time to chase after the Golden Goblin. </span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;If I don&apos;t catch it this time, it&apos;ll become a big headache.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">From Hyrkan&apos;s memories, the Lost World.... &#xA0;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">He didn&#x2019;t know who had named it the Black Continent, but he knew how he would be able to survive here.</span></p><p><span style="">Of course, the Golden Goblin being chased by Hyrkan was one of this methods.</span></p><p><span style="">Golden Goblin.</span></p><p><span style="">It was a level 200 monster, but it wasn&apos;t worth anything. &#xA0;Its EXP was non-existent, and it wasn&apos;t as if it dropped any good Ingredient Items. &#xA0;It was also very weak. &#xA0;A level 100 User could kill it.</span></p><p><span style="">Since it was weak, it hid in a shelter where monsters and Users couldn&apos;t find it.</span></p><p><span style="">The Golden Goblin&apos;s shelter was a Dungeon.</span></p><p><span style="">Moreover, a Dungeon at the Black Continent was a Ruin. &#xA0;He was sure of it.</span></p><p><span style="">The vestige of the Ruined Kingdom! </span></p><p><span style="">This was where the third Main Scenario would start.</span></p><p><span style="">One had to go into the Ruins of the Ruined Kingdom to find the clues. &#xA0;After obtaining the quest, one had find more clues to advance.</span></p><p><span style="">What kind of power did the Ruined Kingdom have? &#xA0;What had they fought, and what had caused its demise!</span></p><p><span style="">When one finds out about this truth, the Ruined Kingdom episode comes to an end.</span></p><p><span style="">This was why the Golden Goblin, which was being chased by Hyrkan, was important. &#xA0;The bastard was the starting point for the Ruined Kingdom episode.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Shit. &#xA0;Why the hell is it so fast?&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">Of course, it wouldn&apos;t be caught easily. &#xA0;The Golden Goblin was unbelievably fast. &#xA0;Even the great Hyrkan would lose sight of it sometimes. &#xA0;If it was any other User, it would have already escaped.</span></p><p><span style="">Moreover, there was no point in just catching it.</span></p><p><span style="">One had to chase after it. &#xA0;He had to make it so that it ran towards its hideout. &#xA0;This was why it was driving Hyrkan nuts.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Uh? Uh!&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">He had summoned Skeletons to herd it. &#xA0;However, the Skeletons possessed AI for fighting monsters, so they were sometimes more trouble than help.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Sto&#xB7;&#xB7;&#xB7;&#xB7;&#xB7;&#xB7;.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Don&apos;t kill it!&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">The Skeleton Warriors were able to chase it down and kill it. &#xA0;However, it didn&apos;t have much talent at herding it.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Shit!&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">Before he could flick his finger to put it in defensive mode, one Skeleton Warrior got in the path of the Golden Goblin. &#xA0;It immediately cut the Golden Goblin into two.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ooh-ahhhhhhh!&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">This was how Hyrkan failed for the fourth time.</span></p><p>4.</p><p><span style="">Sinclair raised his head. &#xA0;He saw the Urugal mountain range, which was surrounded by a thick fog.</span></p><p><span style="">Sinclair turned his head. &#xA0;He saw the thousand Users, who were following his orders. &#xA0;They were the guild members of the Big Smiles guild.</span></p><p><span style="">Sinclair smiled. </span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;This doesn&apos;t feel too bad.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">The most recent events brushed by Sinclair&apos;s thoughts.</span></p><p><span style="">The very first memory that came to mind was the fight with Sohank. &#xA0;When he caught Sohank in the Northland, he had become the Big Smiles&apos; biggest asset. &#xA0;He received the VIP treatment. &#xA0;Of course, he lost to the Hahoe Mask, but no one considered it a loss for Sinclair. &#xA0;No one spoke disparaging remarks towards Sinclair.</span></p><p><span style="">This was how the VIP treatment had started, and it was sweet. &#xA0;All the issues regarding the main Boss Monster Raids and the deployment of troops in the Big Smiles guild was now in his hands. &#xA0;If one compared this to how a country was run, he had basically received control of the army.</span></p><p><span style="">Naturally, his reputation had increased. &#xA0;The Big Smiles guild had a massive fan following in China, and the guild had wanted someone like him to show up. &#xA0;The guild was busy portraying Sinclair as a hero. &#xA0;The shows that featured Sinclair always received a lot of views and interest.</span></p><p><span style="">Sinclair&#x2019;s control and the influence of his words deepened further. &#xA0;Moreover, with the help of Sinclair, Brooks was able to become the very first guild master of the Big Smiles. &#xA0;As promised, Apollo became a master of a sub-guild.</span></p><p><span style="">The product of his power could be seen behind Sinclair.Thousand Users would try to cross the Urugal mountain range. &#xA0;They would be fortunate if half of them were able to pass the Skull Collector. &#xA0;However, Sinclair was indifferent about it. &#xA0;He had risen to a position where he didn&apos;t need to worry about such things.</span></p><p><span style="">Moreover, his guild wasn&apos;t the only one doing this.</span></p><p><span style="">Big Smiles and V&amp;V guild were allies now. &#xA0;A total of 5 guilds had decided to ally with each other, and they would attempt the crossing together.</span></p><p><span style="">Their goal was 10,000 Users!</span></p><p><span style="">They would send incredible amount of Users towards the Black Continent, and they&#x2019;ll for a kingdom over there with the 10,000 Users.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Hahoe Mask. &#xA0;No matter how much you struggle over there you&#x2019;ll be by yourself. &#xA0;You won&#x2019;t &#xA0;be able to face a kingdom without any help.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">Warlord was in disorder, and they were going to unify Warlord under their rule.</span></p><p><span style="">Sinclair put on a deep smile as he thought about the future.</span></p>
