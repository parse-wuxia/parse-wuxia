<p><span style=""> Chapter 182 &#x2013; Golden Conch (1)</span></p><p>1.</p><p><span style="">This enormous typhoon couldn&#x2019;t be compared to anything that came before it.</span></p><p><span style="">- The Hahoe Mask took down the Big Smiles guild! </span></p><p><span style="">It was too big. &#xA0;When the typhoon made its appearance, the first reaction that arose was to confirm the validity of this event.</span></p><p><span style="">- What are you talking about? &#xA0;The Hahoe Mask took down the Big Smiles guild? </span></p><p><span style="">- Are you talking about a guild war? &#xA0;Didn&#x2019;t that happen at the Frozen Land?</span></p><p><span style="">- &#x3134; However, didn&#x2019;t the most recent clash occur at the Highwood Forest? &#xA0;Isn&#x2019;t the situation within the Highwood Forest completely different from the one that occurred at the Frozen Land?</span></p><p><span style="">People were only discussing the validity of this particular news, and all other discussions were swept away by this typhoon. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">The V&amp;V guild&#x2019;s Poker team had found a new ruin, and they had caught the Cerberus guarding the ruin. &#xA0;Tobo Soft&#x2019;s next project after Warlord was leaked. &#xA0;&#xA0;The Red Bulls guild had headed west after crossing the Black Continent. &#xA0;There was a rumor saying the First One turned down an exclusive sponsor contract that would have paid him one million dollars.</span></p><p><span style="">However, all these news became past stories in front of the enormous typhoon created by the Hahoe Mask. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">Then the truth started to trickle out.</span></p><p><span style="">- The Big Smiles formed a hunting team to kill the Hahoe Mask. &#xA0;These Users were all over level 220, and they were the elites of the Big Smiles guild.</span></p><p><span style="">- They tried to use the Hahoe Mask&#x2019;s revenge play for the Pitbull against him. &#xA0;They used the Users, who hunted down the Pitbull, as bait.</span></p><p><span style="">- The Hahoe Mask bit the bait.</span></p><p><span style="">The shape, size and the power of the typhoon was immense! </span></p><p><span style="">- The Hahoe Mask won. </span></p><p><span style="">Three days had passed since the typhoon had occurred, and a single video was uploaded regarding this incident. &#xA0;The video was uploaded on the Hahoe Mask&#x2019;s youtube page, and it was a free video.</span></p><p><span style="">The first scene of the video was the Hahoe Mask&#x2019;s monologue.</span></p><p><span style="">- Before I explain my side of the story regarding the affair that had occurred recently, I would like to put out a statement. &#xA0;I forgive the Big Smiles guild. &#xA0;Let us end our feud here. &#xA0;I won&#x2019;t attack or threaten the Big Smiles in regards to this incident.</span></p><p><span style="">After his monologue ended, Hahoe Mask&#x2019;s &#x2018;Giant Killing&#x2019; video started. &#xA0;It climbed over a million views after two days.</span></p><p>2.</p><p><span style="">&#x201C;This isn&#x2019;t funny.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Are you watching it again?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I&#x2019;m telling you. &#xA0;This isn&#x2019;t funny.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan had a sullen expression at Whistling&#x2019;s words. &#xA0;Of course, one couldn&#x2019;t see his expression, because the Hahoe Mask was covering his face.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;If it isn&#x2019;t funny, why do you keep watching it?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan finally expressed how he felt through his own mouth. &#xA0;Instead of answering, Whistling &#xA0;put on a pleased smile as an answer.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Over there! &#xA0;He&#x2019;s over there!&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Wow. My heart is beating faster.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;You heartbeat can&#x2019;t beat faster inside this game.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I&#x2019;m just saying.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">A man and a woman was running full tilt towards the two.</span></p><p><span style="">Yojori and Joba was like a freight train. &#xA0;They were charging forward as if they weren&#x2019;t going to stop, but they stopped on a dime in front of Hyrkan.</span></p><p><span style="">When they came to a stop, they started shouting towards Hyrkan.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I...I saw your video. &#xA0;Giant Killing! &#xA0;It was really incredible!&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;H...how was that possible? &#xA0;I&#x2019;ve seen it over a hundred times, yet I&#x2019;m having a hard time believing it.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hundred? &#xA0;Stop lying. &#xA0;If you saw it hundred times, then I saw it 200 times.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What? How do you know if I lied or not! &#xA0;I really saw it a hundred times!&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">They were making a big fuss.</span></p><p><span style="">However, Hyrkan was satisfied by their reaction.</span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan had wanted to elicit the reaction he was seeing from the two of them.</span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan turned to look at Whistling as the two continued their antic.</span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan looked at Whistling as if to say, &#x2018;This is the reaction you should be having instead of snorting!&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">When Whistling read Hyrkan&#x2019;s countenance and message, he shook his head from side to side before he looked away.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;What an amazing guy.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">Whistling turned his gaze away, and he forced down his exclamation. &#xA0;He shoved it down his throat. </span></p><p><span style="">He held it in.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;I never expected him to really win against the Big Smiles guild&#x2026;.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">The Hahoe Mask and the Big Smiles guild had collided. &#xA0;The public decided to copy the Hahoe Mask&#x2019;s title for his video, and the incident was now called the Giant Killing. &#xA0;A week had passed since the incident. &#xA0;However, the people of Warlord was still having a trouble digesting the reality of the incident. &#xA0;This was how shocking this incident was.</span></p><p><span style="">Hahoe Mask always took on impossible challenges, and he brought the impossible into reality. &#xA0;This was why people were fanatical about him.</span></p><p><span style="">However, this incident was on a whole different dimension compared to anything the Hahoe Mask had pulled off before.</span></p><p><span style="">A tectonic shift had occurred.</span></p><p><span style="">Accompanying the tectonic shift in a land where the 30 great guilds existed, a 31st power had appeared.</span></p><p><span style="">Of course, in the past, the Hahoe Mask and the 30 great guilds&#x2026;.</span></p><p><span style="">Their relationship could only be described as an ill-fated relationship. &#xA0;However, Hyrkan had been able to declare a war against the Big Smiles guild, and he had won. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">He had achieved victory when he had crossed the Terube castle wall to gain the rights to explore the Northland. &#xA0;He was also the first one to find the Frozen Kingdom.</span></p><p><span style="">However, all his previous victories were the result of a spontaneous battles. &#xA0;At the time, the Northland Exploration team of the Big Smiles weren&#x2019;t part of the main force. &#xA0;Killer Sinclair was part of the main force, but he had been ambushed by the Hahoe Mask after fighting a fierce battle with the Second Head Sohank. &#xA0;So this event hadn&#x2019;t been taken seriously.</span></p><p><span style="">What about the most recent event? </span></p><p><span style="">The Hahoe Mask had gone after the heart of the Big Smiles guild. &#xA0;The Big Smiles guild had gathered most of their elite Users, and they had even set up their own stage. &#xA0;They had used a bait to lure the Hahoe Mask, and they had had put their best foot forward in this attempt. </span></p><p><span style="">However, they hadn&#x2019;t been able to catch the Hahoe Mask, and they had suffered a loss to more than half their forces in trying to catch a single User.</span></p><p><span style="">Of course, there was a portion of the population that had rejected this narrative.</span></p><p><span style="">The Hahoe Mask had run away, so wouldn&#x2019;t the winner be the Big Smiles guild? </span></p><p><span style="">However, the answer to that question was quite simple.</span></p><p><span style="">If one wanted to know the result of the war, one just have to look at the status of the winner and the loser. </span></p><p><span style="">The winner would receive acclamation, and the loser had no words to say in excuse.</span></p><p><span style="">The Hahoe Mask&#x2019;s acclamation came in the form of views. &#xA0;The Giant Killing video had already recorded 300 million views. &#xA0;On the other hand, the Big Smiles guild refused to respond or give an official statement regarding the issue. &#xA0;They kept their mouths shut.</span></p><p><span style="">It was ridiculous for a third party to discuss as to who was the winner and the loser.</span></p><p><span style="">The Hahoe Mask had done something incredible.</span></p><p><span style="">How was this possible? &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">Even after watching the video released by Hyrkan, people were having a hard time believing it.</span></p><p><span style="">Moreover, when they started accepting as truth, the next logical question was posed.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;&#xB7;&#xB7;&#xB7;&#xB7;&#xB7;&#xB7;so why did this occur?&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">The Users slowly started to pose the question.</span></p><p><span style="">Why did the Hahoe Mask and the Big Smiles guild go to war?</span></p><p><span style="">The aftereffect created by the war with Hyrkan was now being felt by the Big Smiles guild and the other 30 great guilds.</span></p><p><span style="">None of the 30 great guilds were able to give an official statement regarding the event. &#xA0;In such an unheard of situation, the mighty 30 great guilds were dismayed.</span></p><p><span style="">Whistling didn&#x2019;t think the feeling of dismay would work in Hyrkan&#x2019;s favor. &#xA0;The 30 great guilds would now look at Hyrkan as a competitor.</span></p><p><span style="">He wasn&#x2019;t just a loose nail one had to worry about stepping on. &#xA0;He would be viewed as a morningstar that could bludgeon them.</span></p><p><span style="">They would try to keep him in check instead of cooperating with him.</span></p><p><span style="">Of course, at the same time, the 30 great guilds couldn&#x2019;t rashly attack the Hahoe Mask either.</span></p><p><span style="">He was now a peer of the 30 great guilds, and they would have to treat him accordingly.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;What is he pursuing?&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan didn&#x2019;t have to travel this road. &#xA0;This road was very far from guaranteeing wealth and fame.</span></p><p><span style="">Whistling knew this better than anyone. &#xA0;The Hahoe Mask had been untroubled when they had parted before. &#xA0;The Hahoe Mask had already set his course. &#xA0;It meant everything up to now had been planned by him, and he had been pursuing this result. </span></p><p><span style="">So why did Hyrkan choose to walk on this particular path?</span></p><p><span style="">Whistling pushed down the mounting questions.</span></p><p><span style="">In the previous exchange, he had snorted towards Hyrkan as he pushed downed his exclamation.</span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan was his friend.</span></p><p><span style="">Of course, he could ask questions about Hyrkan&#x2019;s motivations, but it wasn&#x2019;t the time to do so. &#xA0;This was a conversation that should happen over a beer.</span></p><p><span style="">For now, he just had to keep his mouth shut, and help his friend in any way he could. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">Moreover, this was also the reason why this meeting was scheduled. &#xA0;He was here to help Hyrkan.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Anyways, I heard you earned the Quest Reward for Elven Kingdom Relic Quest.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;When we received the Seed of the Record Tree from the Den of the Rebels, we immediately exchanged it for the reward. &#xA0;We brought it back with us.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">However, their Quest didn&#x2019;t match up with Hyrkan&#x2019;s Quest.</span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan would have to go to the Red Desert again to meet the Red Elf tribe. &#xA0;If he wanted to do so, he needed the Artifact. &#xA0;It was an Artifact from the Barley Kingdom.</span></p><p><span style="">Fortunately, Yojori and Joba had received the Artifact of the Barley Kingdom as a reward for their Quest.</span></p><p><span style="">This was why this meeting had been set up. &#xA0;They wanted to help Hyrkan progress in his Quest.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;So you are saying you will travel with me&#x2026;. &#xA0;Will that be ok?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">At that point, Hyrkan gave up on asking the reason behind their actions. </span></p><p><span style="">Unless Hydra guild was dumb, they would have already figured out why Whistling was killed in the Highwood Forest by the Big Smiles guild.</span></p><p><span style="">They probably knew Whistling had met with the Hahoe Mask.</span></p><p><span style="">If Hyrkan was in the Hydra guild&#x2019;s shoes, he would have given the order barring any contact with the Hahoe Mask.</span></p><p><span style="">He would have asked them to leave the guild if this order wasn&#x2019;t followed. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">Of course, Whistling, Yojori and Joba had &#xA0;similar personalities. &#xA0;They could easily choose to leave the guild, yet Hyrkan didn&#x2019;t want them to suffer so much.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I&#x2019;m sorry, but we won&#x2019;t be able to travel with you. &#xA0;We are under orders from our guild.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">It was as he guessed.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I&#x2019;m sorry.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;You don&#x2019;t have to be sorry.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan nodded his head as if this was the preferable course of action. &#xA0;Since he had gained a hint for his Quest, he had gained a lot in this venture. &#xA0;If needed, he could follow the line of Quests being progressed by the Whistling Family.</span></p><p><span style="">This would naturally allow him to received the Artifact of the Barley Kingdom as a reward.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;As for the Quest information&#x2026;.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan had planned on purchasing the Quest Information from them. &#xA0;He wanted this to be a clean transaction.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;This is why we had a discussion amongst ourselves. &#xA0;This Item is unbound. &#xA0;We&#x2019;ll just give this to you.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Huh?&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan stopped speaking, and before Hyrkan could react in surprise, Joba brought out an Item from a pouch on his waist. &#xA0;It was a lump of gold. &#xA0;He took out a Gold Bar that was as big as his hand.</span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan became surprised at the appearance of the Gold Bar, and he became much more surprised when he heard this Item would be given to him.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;This&#xB7;&#xB7;&#xB7;&#xB7;&#xB7;&#xB7;.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;This is the Artifact. &#xA0;If you activate the Item Info Window, it will identify itself as the Artifact of the Barley Kingdom.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;No, wait a moment. &#xA0;You are just giving this to me?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan rephrased his words as he continued to speak.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Are you sure you can just give this to me? &#xA0;What about your next Quest? &#xA0;I&#x2019;m pretty sure you guys need this Item.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">This was a Quest Reward. This was needed to progress into the next Quest.</span></p><p><span style="">If they wanted to meet the Red Elf tribe, they would need this Item, yet they were just going to give it to him? </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Anyways, we don&#x2019;t have the strength needed to go meet the Red Elf tribe.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;We can go do another Quest. &#xA0;There are many more Elves out there.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">After looking at the two, Hyrkan turned to look at Whistling.</span></p><p><span style="">Whistling spoke to Hyrkan.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Thank you for avenging me.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Whistling&#x2019;s words were short. &#xA0;Hyrkan struggled with his thoughts for a moment before he grabbed the Gold Bar.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;All right. &#xA0;If someone messes with you guys again, tell me about it. &#xA0;As I&#x2019;ve said before, I&#x2019;m really good at what I do.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">This wasn&#x2019;t a trade. &#xA0;They had helped him.</span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan accepted it.</span></p><p>3.</p><p><span style="">After the incident, the Big Smiles guild didn&#x2019;t talk about the incident. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">Even the normal guild members of the Big Smiles guild didn&apos;t know the details of what had occurred. &#xA0;However, stories started to spread through word of mouth. &#xA0;Moreover, the word of their defeated started to spread too.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Did we really lose?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;This makes no sense. &#xA0;There were over 50 Users with an average of level 220, and we even used a bait yet we lost&#x2026;..&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Moreover, this happened at the Highwood Forest. &#xA0;That region is ours! &#xA0;I can understand being defeated in the Red Desert, but how could we not kill the Hahoe Mask inside the Highwood Forest? &#xA0;Even if we had caught him immediately, wouldn&#x2019;t we have come out at a loss?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">However, there was no clear evidence that they had lost. &#xA0;Even if the defeat was likely, the Big Smiles guild members started to push back on the idea that they had lost.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;That damn Hahoe Mask bitch ass.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;How many times do we have to go through this because of that bastard?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I&#x2019;m sure he used some ridiculous trick. &#xA0;That bastard is cheap and cowardly.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">The source of the push back was the hate and anger they felt towards the Hahoe Mask. &#xA0;A loss was a loss, but some decided to use the defeat as fertilizer for an even bigger revenge.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Who cares if we lost? &#xA0;We should use this opportunity to designate the Hahoe Mask as an enemy, and the whole guild should hunt him down.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes, we should do this. &#xA0;Let us see who will come out on top. &#xA0;How long will that bastard last after picking a fight with the Big Smiles guild?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Even if we have to fight him ten times, we just have to win once. &#xA0;When he loses, his personal hell will start.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">A stumble could determine if one won or lost.</span></p><p><span style="">Some guild members clung to this old saying. &#xA0;They were determined to get their revenge.</span></p><p><span style="">However, all their will were crushed when the video was released.</span></p><p><span style="">Giant Killing. </span></p><p><span style="">The video was a period placed at the end of a sentence. &#xA0;The will for revenge and the anger they felt towards the Hahoe Mask came to a full stop.</span></p><p><span style="">There was no ambiguity to the story anymore.</span></p><p><span style="">The Hahoe Mask had won. &#xA0;However, it wasn&#x2019;t as if the Hahoe Mask had asked for money or their territory for his victory. &#xA0;He had taken ownership of the situation. &#xA0;He didn&#x2019;t even ask the Big Smiles for an apology. &#xA0;He had forgiven them.</span></p><p><span style="">In such a situation, how could the Big Smiles guild express their hostility towards the Hahoe Mask?</span></p><p><span style="">They could do it.</span></p><p><span style="">However, the public and even the fans of the Big Smiles guild wouldn&#x2019;t support their vendetta against the Hahoe Mask.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;This is it.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">For the second time, the meeting of the officers occurred. &#xA0;When Sinclair heard about it, he couldn&#x2019;t help, but sneer in disdain. &#xA0;He shook his head from side to side.</span></p><p><span style="">This time he was invited to participate in the meeting of the officers, but Sinclair had turned it down.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;This has come to a complete end.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">They only looked for him when they needed him. &#xA0;There was no reason why he should move when they clapped. &#xA0;Sinclair just waited for the summary report that&#x2019;ll come out after the meeting of the officers. &#xA0;Sinclair played the Hahoe Mask&#x2019;s video again.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;This war&#x2026;. &#xA0;It feels as if the Hahoe Mask had been preparing for it for a long time. &#xA0;If not, how could he deal with the aftermath so cleanly&#x2026;..&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">The Hahoe Mask&#x2019;s strategy in the battle was surprising, but the more surprising part was how he navigated through consequences of the battle.</span></p><p><span style="">The war had started out as a petty revenge plot, yet after becoming victorious, he brought everything to a full stop by forgiving his opponents. &#xA0;In reality, wars within games didn&#x2019;t end so cleanly. &#xA0;It was a messy affair, so this was a rare occasion.</span></p><p><span style="">Revenge begets revenge. &#xA0;The war usually continued in a vicious cycle of violence.</span></p><p><span style="">Moreover, no one had ever gone up against the mighty power of the 30 great guilds like the Hahoe Mask. &#xA0;One couldn&#x2019;t even find an analogous incident in other games. &#xA0;There were no reference cases. &#xA0;This was a first.</span></p><p><span style="">Even though this was a first, the Hahoe Mask was able to bring about this result.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;I&#x2019;m really curious about his identity.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">Sinclair received a call.</span></p><p><span style="">- Sinclair. </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Horus.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">- What a fucking mess.</span></p><p><span style="">Horus was the one contacting him. &#xA0;Horus was Sinclair&#x2019;s comrade, who had agreed with his plan to bring the Hands guild out from the shadow into the sun. &#xA0;Currently, Horus did not represent the Hands guild. &#xA0;He was operating under the Sweepers guild.</span></p><p><span style="">It wasn&#x2019;t as prestigious as being in the Poker team, but Horus was achieving victory after victory. &#xA0;Sinclair didn&#x2019;t feel too good about it.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Did you call me to make fun of me?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">- No way. It was your plan for us to come out from the background. &#xA0;If you fail, then I fail. &#xA0;Why would I make fun of your failure? &#xA0;We are basically tied at the hips.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Then are you planning on helping me out?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">- I&#x2019;m sorry, but I don&#x2019;t know how I&#x2019;ll be able to help you. &#xA0;Just think of it as you unwittingly stepping on shit. &#xA0;Fortunately, you didn&#x2019;t participate in this disaster, so the damage was somewhat blunted. &#xA0;At the very least, you saved your face.</span></p><p><span style="">He had saved his face.</span></p><p><span style="">Sinclair nodded his head at those words. The atmosphere around the Big Smiles guild was a mess, but in the end, the only positive news was the fact that Sinclair hadn&#x2019;t participated in the Hahoe Mask hunt.</span></p><p><span style="">Some were saying that Sinclair had opposed to hunting down the Hahoe Mask. &#xA0;Some in the guild built upon this narrative, and they said Sinclair had wanted a fair fight with the Hahoe Mask. &#xA0;This was the rumor being spread.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;I was right in not dipping my toe into this water.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">This was also the reason why he was the Big Smiles&#x2019; only hope. &#xA0;If the Killer was able to win against the Hahoe Mask in a 1 on 1 battle, all the humiliation and the losses they suffered could be settled.</span></p><p><span style="">If they didn&#x2019;t have this sense of expectation, the Big Smiles guild would have suffered losses several magnitude larger.</span></p><p><span style="">- It is quite funny. &#xA0;You have basically taken over the Big Smiles guild through this. &#xA0;In truth, I&#x2019;m not sure if I should be consoling your right now. &#xA0;In the end, this is your gain.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;You can look at it that way. &#xA0;Still, this doesn&#x2019;t feel great.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">This sense of expectation was why Sinclair&#x2019;s position was impregnable now. &#xA0;In the end, this incident had to be owned by the guild master and the sub-guild masters, who had signed off on it.</span></p><p><span style="">Even if he wasn&#x2019;t in a top management position, his voice would be loudest within the guild.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Still, what is the point of becoming an owner of a tiger with no teeth and claws?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">- Still, it is much better than taking care of the tiger from the shadow.</span></p><p><span style="">Better? </span></p><p><span style="">After speaking those words, Sinclair thought on it for a moment.</span></p><p><span style="">He compared the time he spent in the Hands guild as a Helper, and the period of time he operated as the Killer.</span></p><p><span style="">Which period of time did he prefer? &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">Was his current situation better for him? &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">Of course, he preferred the latter time period. &#xA0;The amount of money he was making wasn&#x2019;t too different, yet his brand recognition had changed drastically. &#xA0;When he was a Helper, no one even knew his name was Sinclair. &#xA0;Now he was one of the skilled Users, who represented Warlord.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Mmmm.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">At that moment, Sinclair was torn. &#xA0;If was an obvious question with an obvious answer to it, yet he had to think about it.</span></p><p><span style="">It basically meant that the answer wasn&#x2019;t obvious anymore.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;...yes. &#xA0;The current situation is preferable.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">- Let&#x2019;s end the idle chatter here. &#xA0;In truth, our biggest problem isn&#x2019;t the Hahoe Mask.</span></p><p><span style="">Horus changed the topic.</span></p><p><span style="">- The Stormhunters guild is progressing through the game too fast. &#xA0;They are moving faster than the Hahoe Mask.</span></p><p><span style="">Sinclair nodded his head. &#xA0;Hahoe Mask was very fast in progressing through the game, but the the fastest one was the Stormhunters guild. &#xA0;They had focused their entire guild&#x2019;s resources in progressing through the Quest, and the Hahoe Mask had wasted several days fighting the Big Smiles guild. &#xA0;The Stormhunters guild had used that time to significantly progress in their goal to head towards the end of the game.</span></p><p><span style="">- Also&#x2026; &#xA0;It is only a rumor, but I&#x2019;ve heard that the Stormhunters guild and the Red Bulls guild might form an alliance.</span></p><p><span style="">Horus&#x2019; rumor made Sinclair tense. &#xA0;He shifted his position.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Those two guilds?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">- Those two guilds also know a good deal about the Warlord&#x2019;s System. &#xA0;If the game is coming to an end, they want to be the first and last conqueror of Warlord. &#xA0;This had always been their goal from the start.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What about our upper management?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">-The Five Star Project will have to be implemented in earnest.</span></p><p><span style="">Five Star Project.</span></p><p><span style="">At those words, Sinclair gritted his teeth.</span></p><p><span style="">- If we aren&#x2019;t careful&#x2026;.. &#xA0;It&#x2019;ll be war. &#xA0;This won&#x2019;t be like this small war between a User and a guild. &#xA0;This will be Guilds vs Guilds. &#xA0;It&#x2019;ll be a Guild War.</span></p>
