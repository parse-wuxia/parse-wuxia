<p>Chapter 187 &#x2013; Barbarian King (4)</p><p><span style="">11.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Good job.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan felt drained as he had to meet and greet with several thousand Users for the past couple hours. &#xA0;Whistling spoke to him. &#xA0;Hyrkan looked at Whistling as he shook his head from side to side. &#xA0;Then he let out his complaint in a low voice.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Why do Elves matter so much&#x2026;&#x2026;&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Of course, Hyrkan knew why Whistling had moved against the Barbarian King. &#xA0;Whistling didn&#x2019;t want the Elven tribes to become exterminated by the Barbarian King. &#xA0;In turn, Whistling was the reason why Hyrkan had moved. &#xA0;Basically, the Elven tribes had caused a shift inside Warlord. &#xA0;This was the behind the scene story for this war.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I&#x2019;m sorry.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Whistling let out a bitter laugh, and he gave his apology.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I&#x2019;m not doing this for nothing.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I&#x2019;ll take you out for a big night out later.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">At Whistling&#x2019;s answer, he no longer spoke. &#xA0;Instead, Hyrkan turned his head.</span></p><p><span style="">Bizma Plain.</span></p><p><span style="">The Skeletons, Golems, and Bone Dragon decorating the place was no longer present. &#xA0;However, the Users hadn&#x2019;t left. &#xA0;They were guarding their spot. &#xA0;At times, the bored Users hunted the monsters nearby, and this was another diversion they could watch. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">Their continued presence was an evidence of longing they were feeling. &#xA0;They had just experienced something uniquely fun inside the game of Warlord, and this was proof that the Users wanted to enjoy it for a little bit longer.</span></p><p><span style="">This also meant the Users had fully enjoyed what Hyrkan had to offer. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">However, at this time tomorrow, this place would become a desperate battlefield.</span></p><p><span style="">&apos;This is a game.&apos;</span></p><p><span style="">The world had changed in just a single day, and it should have been a frightening sight. &#xA0;However, this wasn&#x2019;t reality. &#xA0;Since this was happening within a game, this wasn&#x2019;t out of the ordinary.</span></p><p><span style="">&apos;Since it&#x2019;s a game&#x2026;&#x2026;&apos;</span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan chewed over this truth.</span></p><p><span style="">It was a game. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">He chewed over the new feeling he was starting to dimly feel. &#xA0;It was something he had never felt before. &#xA0;Hyrkan fell into his thoughts as he tried to identify this vague feeling.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;First, 6322 people have signed up to participate in the Raid.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Whistling&#x2019;s words pulled Hyrkan back into reality.</span></p><p><span style="">The goal for the Hahoe Mask theme park was to gather allied forces, who will join him in this Raid. &#xA0;However, Hyrkan hadn&#x2019;t said cheese for free. &#xA0;He couldn&#x2019;t force these Users to participate, but he obtained signatures from the Users, who were going to participate in the Barbarian King Raid.</span></p><p><span style="">The number was 6,322.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;The ratio isn&#x2019;t too bad. &#xA0;The important fact is that 2,551 Tankers signed up. &#xA0;It is a pretty high number.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">The Tanker was the most important position in pulling off this plan, and the number of Tankers, who signed up, was higher than expected.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;They are all over level 200, and they finished their 2nd Advancement. &#xA0;This means it is a force big enough to rival three or four 30 great guilds. &#xA0;Moreover, these are Users, who stayed behind in the Black Continent even with this event going on. &#xA0;Their skills are above average.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">They hadn&#x2019;t tested the quality of the Users, but these Users were all above average by default. &#xA0;Even with the appearance of the Iron Lion Road, it was tough to operate within the Black Continent.</span></p><p><span style="">The deciding factor was the fact that the Black Continent was filled with nightmare right now. &#xA0;However, these Users refused to leave, and their will to fight was burning. &#xA0;Aside from skills and extrinsic factors&#x2026;..</span></p><p><span style="">In terms of mental toughness, they were also above average.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;If half the number shows up, I will have no complaint.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">At Hyrkan&#x2019;s words, Whistling didn&#x2019;t feel too good about the situation, but he nodded his head.</span></p><p><span style="">In terms of gathering people, it was beyond his expectation.</span></p><p><span style="">As expected of the Hahoe Mask!</span></p><p><span style="">It almost made Whistling sigh in admiration. &#xA0;If Whistling had used the Hahoe Mask&#x2019;s reputation to gather the Users, he wouldn&#x2019;t have been able to gather 6,000 Users. &#xA0;He might not have been able to gather even 3,000 Users.</span></p><p><span style="">Still, there was no way everyone gathered here would participate in the battle. &#xA0;They would be fortunate if half of them stepped forward. &#xA0;That would still amount to 3,000 Users.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;They&#x2019;ll come. &#xA0;You said so many cheeses for them.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">After hearing his reply, Hyrkan started a simulation of the battle that&#x2019;ll occur tomorrow on the Bizma Plain.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;They have to hold out for one hour.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Barbarian King.</span></p><p><span style="">It was a monster amongst monsters, who had beaten back numerous challengers and attackers. &#xA0;It was the most ruthless Boss Monster to appear in Warlord. &#xA0;It boasted special characteristics, skills and difficulty level that made people curse.</span></p><p><span style="">However, for the past month, the Users hadn&#x2019;t been playing around. &#xA0;They had attempted it 31 times. &#xA0;It wasn&#x2019;t a small number. &#xA0;Tens of thousand of Users had thrown their bodies towards the Barbarian King. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">It happened slowly, but they compiled a clear method for the Barbarian King. &#xA0;Then they threw their bodies into the Raid to see if the methods they devised actually worked.</span></p><p><span style="">It was like a blind man feeling the leg of an elephant to confirm that it was an elephant. &#xA0;This task was akin to that.</span></p><p><span style="">Then there was Whistling&#x2019;s new comrades&#x2026;. &#xA0;One of them was named the Questman, and he came up with a conjecture using all the information he gathered regarding the Main Scenario Quest.</span></p><p><span style="">It had to be done during the 2nd Phase called the Storm Judgement mode. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">What would happen if one could lure the Barbarian King into the path of the Storme Judgement?</span></p><p><span style="">It would be like the scene in a movie where a missile was lured into the path of an enemy.</span></p><p><span style="">Storm Judgement was the Dragon&#x2019;s Judgement. </span></p><p><span style=""> Would the Barbarian King be fine from being hit by it? </span></p><p><span style=""> Even if it survived the strike, would an abnormal status go into effect?</span></p><p><span style="">This hypothesis was put into action, and it was tried 31 times in the Barbarian King Raid. &#xA0;All of the Raids failed, but they acquired useful results. &#xA0;This was how they found the method to clear the 2nd Phase. &#xA0;When a thunder strike falls on top of one&#x2019;s head, it was suicide to charge towards the currently strongest monster in Warlord.</span></p><p><span style="">However, this was also the most important part in taking down the Barbarian King.</span></p><p><span style="">Sacrifice. </span></p><p><span style="">Numerous sacrifices were needed to be able to latch onto the Barbarian King, and more sacrifices were needed to ensure the success of the Armor Breaking. &#xA0;The Judgement would inevitably fall, and in the end, Users had to put up with being sacrificed.</span></p><p><span style="">From start to finish, the Barbarian King required sacrifices from the challenging Users.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Are you really planning on killing it on &#xA0;your own?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">However, Hyrkan planned on killing such a foe by himself.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Just block the others from interfering with me.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">It was a preposterous task. &#xA0;One couldn&#x2019;t even say it was dumb, because it was absurd.</span></p><p><span style="">However, Hyrkan insisted on choosing this path. &#xA0;Hyrkan wasn&#x2019;t doing this, because he was trying to uphold the name of the Hahoe Mask.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;The Barbarian King&#x2019;s attack pattern, route, clear method and speed is all in my mind. &#xA0;The only thing I can&#x2019;t predict are the disrupters.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">There were two reasons why he was doing this. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">First, there was the existence of disrupters.</span></p><p><span style="">There were countless number of people, who thought poorly of Hyrkan. &#xA0;They wouldn&#x2019;t just sit back, while eating popcorn.</span></p><p><span style="">Moreover, the six thousand Users weren&#x2019;t all hiding behind trees as they attempted to hide their identities. &#xA0;No, his enemies didn&#x2019;t even need to hide. &#xA0;The disrupters just had to come to the Bizma plain in the morning, and they could just join the fight. &#xA0;Who would turn them away?</span></p><p><span style="">This was a problem with a festival. &#xA0;You can&#x2019;t stop people from joining.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Moreover, I&#x2019;m more comfortable fighting by myself.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">There were two steps to clearing the Barbarian King Raid.</span></p><p><span style="">When one wanted to kill the Barbarian King in its 2nd Phase, one had to bait its special ability called Storm Judgement. &#xA0;This attack targeted a single User within its range. &#xA0;This was why the targeted individual had to approached the Barbarian King within 3 seconds. &#xA0;This was also the reason why everyone said this method was impossible to pull off.</span></p><p><span style="">However, Hyrkan thought differently. &#xA0;What would happen if there was only one User within range of the Storm Judgement? </span></p><p><span style="">The act of finding the targeted User would be irrelevant. &#xA0;It would be clear, who was the target.</span></p><p><span style="">This was why Hyrkan chose to solo this.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Ah. &#xA0;It&#x2019;ll be more convenient for me, but I&#x2019;m not saying it&#x2019;ll easy.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">At Hyrkan&#x2019;s words, everyone swallowed their words, and they just agreed with him.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;This game is hard.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;It isn&apos;t just hard. &#xA0;It is damn hard.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">As they expressed their annoyance, Hyrkan once again looked at the Bizma Plain. &#xA0;He&#x2019;ll be dancing with the Barbarian King tomorrow. &#xA0;It&#x2019;ll be a fierce dance as thunder descended towards him. &#xA0;He&#x2019;ll be dancing around the Barbarian King until the Announcement notified him that he was the target of the Storm Judgement. &#xA0;He&#x2019;ll clash, retreat and clash again with joy.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Still, it&#x2019;ll be pretty easy to name the video.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;You&#x2019;ve already chosen a title?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Of course. &#xA0;If I don&#x2019;t receive income from my videos, I can&#x2019;t play this game. &#xA0;The title will be Ballroom.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ballroom?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Welcome to the Ballroom.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Why would you name it&#x2026;.?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">He&#x2019;ll do a dance that can only be done by the Hahoe Mask on this stage.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I&#x2019;ll really liven it up with a dance.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">12.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Currently, there are around five thousand Users gathered at the Bizma Plain.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;The Hahoe Mask team is getting ready for the Raid. &#xA0;The 30 great guilds haven&#x2019;t shown up yet.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I&#x2019;m here to join this historical event, which won&#x2019;t be broadcasted through the live channels.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Bizma Plain.</span></p><p><span style="">Numerous Users of all types could be seen on the vast field.</span></p><p><span style="">The most busy Users were the ones trying to record &#xA0;every step of this process. &#xA0;They wanted to document it, so they can sell the Barbarian King Raid footage. &#xA0;Hahoe Mask had given up claiming sole rights in regards to using the Raid footage for profit. &#xA0;He would allow anyone to record and use footage of him.</span></p><p><span style="">Of course, this was a small present he was giving to those, who chose to fight with him. &#xA0;The people, who fought with him, could record the entire process. &#xA0;Moreover, they could do whatever they wanted with the footage. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">However, greedy Users had also gathered here like a swarm of mosquitoes. &#xA0;When one smiled in thanks in front of such generosity, another let out a devious smile. &#xA0;These Users only wanted to make money, and they weren&#x2019;t going to help out in the raid. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">These Users continuously moved around the Bizma Plain, and one could always hear the sound of their interviews in the air. &#xA0;It really sounded like the low buzzing of mosquitoes. &#xA0;The Interview Program allowed one to dampen the sound, so outsiders couldn&#x2019;t hear the User&#x2019;s voice. &#xA0;One could just hear a buzz.</span></p><p><span style="">On the other hand, the Users, who came here for the Hahoe Mask, was making preparations.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I&apos;ll explain the plan. &#xA0;The plan will unfold like this. &#xA0;A large scale magical bombardment will be used to decrease the number of monsters around the Barbarian King. &#xA0;Afterwards, the monsters will naturally be pulled by the aggro, and the Tankers will block them.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;We&#x2019;ll form the first battle line, and we&#x2019;ll open a path in one location.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;After establishing the first battle line, The Striker teams will come from eight directions to open up more paths. &#xA0;The Priests, Magicians and Tankers will enter through these paths. &#xA0;Then we have to block monsters from turning back to help the Barbarian King. &#xA0;Our role is to provide a stage where the Hahoe Mask can focus on battling the Barbarian King.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">These Users had enjoyed the festive atmosphere yesterday, but the tactic made them feel faint. &#xA0;They had to hear it again. &#xA0;They weren&#x2019;t just listening to the tactic. &#xA0;They opened their holographic window, and they started drawing out the battle simulation. &#xA0;&#xA0;The prediction was drawn using dots.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;So they want the monsters between the Tankers? &#xA0;This is going to cause a lot of Tankers to die.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;We have no choice. &#xA0;We need to form a wall on both sides, so the Hahoe Mask can go one on one with the Barbarian King.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I took a rough estimate, and I think there are around 2,000 Tankers here. &#xA0;I think about half will be be sent back to the Heard Fortress.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;If only half dies, we&#x2019;ll be fortunate. &#xA0;If the Hahoe Mask fails, we&#x2019;ll probably have to run away with a do-or-die attitude.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">The prediction didn&apos;t look too rosy. &#xA0;Of course, it wouldn&#x2019;t be great. &#xA0;In the first place, the Barbarian King Raid was designed in such a way where sacrifices were baked into the design. &#xA0;This Raid would need more sacrifices compared to any other Boss Monster Raids. &#xA0;&#xA0;Warlord&#x2019;s System had settled on this setting. &#xA0;There were Users gathered here, who had experience all of this multiple time. &#xA0;There were also Users, who had participated in all 31 Barbarian King Raids.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Ah. &#xA0;I think I&#x2019;m going to die today.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">This was why worried words emanated from the Users.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Shit. &#xA0;I don&#x2019;t know why I voluntarily undergo hardship like this.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Words of complaint was also heard.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I should quit this game. &#xA0;Eh-whew.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Everyone let out a sigh, but this was to be expected.</span></p><p><span style="">However, they were thorough in their preparations even as they spoke those words.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Let us all connect to the Voice Talk. &#xA0;Ah ah. &#xA0;Voice Talk test. &#xA0;Ah ah. &#xA0;Voice Talk test. &#xA0;I want members of my team to raise their hands!&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Our team members should say fighting! &#xA0;After getting in position, please go over your roles once again.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;This is a battle where 5,000 people will participate. &#xA0;It is very important that everyone hold their position. &#xA0;Please don&#x2019;t stray outside of your designated position!&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">They were experts. </span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Don&#x2019;t try to spare your body too much!&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;If we lose the Black Continent, we&#x2019;ll lose our only hunting ground. &#xA0;Just close your eyes and take the bullet this one time.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;It takes about the same amount of time to walk back to the Heard Fortress compared to starting again at the town after death. &#xA0;It is only death. &#xA0;It isn&#x2019;t as if we haven&#x2019;t experienced it before.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">These were Users, who had reached Level 200 and the 2nd Advancement. &#xA0;They were qualified to be able to step onto the Black Continent. &#xA0;It wasn&#x2019;t an achievement and result that could be reached by just playing the game of Warlord for a long time.</span></p><p><span style="">One had to be diligent, and one had to be better than others at the game. &#xA0;Moreover, one had to have love for this game.</span></p><p><span style="">Since this was only a game, family members and friends berated them for playing this game too much. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">When will you come to your senses?</span></p><p><span style="">How long will you play this game?</span></p><p><span style="">Does oppa like this game better than me?</span></p><p><span style="">The game of Warlord had become part of their lives, so these Users had heard similar questions.</span></p><p><span style="">One had to accept these pitfalls to achieve these results.</span></p><p><span style="">Casual gamers?</span></p><p><span style="">They were definitely not that.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;All right. &#xA0;Let&#x2019;s ready the Magicians.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;The order of attack will be fire, thunder, wind then ice. &#xA0;Please remember that.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;The Barbarian King is approaching us! &#xA0;Fire Sea team! &#xA0;Get ready!&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">In reality, they were called game couch-potatoes. &#xA0;However, in Warlord, they were proud game experts. &#xA0;They were combat veterans of hundreds of battles. &#xA0;They were experts at turning the tide of the game.</span></p><p><span style="">These were the types of people gathered here.</span></p><p><span style="">They made their resolves.</span></p><p><span style="">They would go out in a blaze of glory in this battle. &#xA0;They wanted a memory that they would remember at the end of their gamer lives.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Holy crap. &#xA0;They are like a swarm of ants charging forward.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Well, haven&#x2019;t we gathered enough Users to resemble a swarm of ants right now? &#xA0;I think this is the first time I&#x2019;ve seen over 5,000 Users gathered in one place.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">This was how the highlight that would long remain in the history of Warlord started.</span></p><p><span style="">13.</span></p><p><span style="">It started with the rain of fire.</span></p><p><span style="">It was the Fire Storm.</span></p><p><span style="">Goo-roo-roo!</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Wow. &#xA0;Look at those clouds.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">The red tinged clouds started to gather atop the heads of the Barbarian King and its subordinates.</span></p><p><span style="">The monsters, who were quick on the uptake, quickly looked up at the clouds. &#xA0;The monsters expressed their wariness.</span></p><p><span style="">Joo-roohk!</span></p><p><span style="">Then the clouds started to spit out rain of fire. &#xA0;The range of the rain was massive. &#xA0;&#xA0;It was hard to calculate the area by using a soccer field as a reference. &#xA0;It felt as if the storm was coming down on a region big enough to be called a small city.</span></p><p><span style="">Moreover, the rain used the vegetations in the Bizma Plain as fuel, and the fire started to spread more fiercely.</span></p><p><span style="">It was as if the rain had caused a flooding. &#xA0;It created a sea of fire.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Roll the fireballs&#xFF01;&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">- We are rolling the fireballs!</span></p><p><span style="">Large fireballs rolled across the sea of fire.</span></p><p><span style="">Kwah-kwah-kwah!</span></p><p><span style="">The fireballs were letting out a rough sound as it rolled onward like a runaway train. &#xA0;The fireballs grew in size as they rolled atop the sea of fire. &#xA0;They grew into enormous sizes, and the small monsters were basically bowling pins in front of them.</span></p><p><span style="">Kuh-hyung, kuh-hyung!</span></p><p><span style="">However, the monsters refused to be defeated like helpless bowling pins.</span></p><p><span style="">The monsters, who had suffered the attack, went on the offensive. &#xA0;They started to select their target through aggro. &#xA0;When the selection ended, they started to move to destroy their targets. &#xA0;The ones that were the quickest were the four-legged monsters. &#xA0;The monsters that looked like wolves, lions and other animals separated from the horde of monsters. &#xA0;They led the charge.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;They are coming.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Are the Buffs complete?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Ok. &#xA0;It&#x2019;s all done! &#xA0;Team 29 complete!&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Team 33 is complete!&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">The eyes of the running monsters rolled around as they let out horrible cries. &#xA0;When the monsters were about to reach them, the Tankers moved. &#xA0;They held a shield in the left hand, and the right hand held the weapon. &#xA0;The Tankers slowly marched towards the monsters.</span></p><p><span style="">After getting into position, the Tankers stood firm. &#xA0;They became a large wall.</span></p><p><span style="">-The battle has started!</span></p><p><span style="">-L Uh? Where are you seeing the Raid from?</span></p><p><span style="">-L My friend is playing the game, and he is streaming it live for me.</span></p><p><span style="">-L Please share the stream!</span></p><p><span style="">-L I want a link too!</span></p><p><span style="">At that moment, the online world was restless.</span></p><p><span style="">In many ways, this was a historical event. &#xA0;This event was not being led by the 30 great guilds. &#xA0;The Barbarian Raid was occurring through the participation of normal Users, so the fans of Warlords were very interested. &#xA0;The interest had peaked.</span></p><p><span style="">However, there was no official live broadcast of this event.</span></p><p><span style="">-Shit. &#xA0;Why aren&#x2019;t they broadcasting this on the live channels?</span></p><p><span style="">-L If they have a sense of honor, they won&#x2019;t do it.</span></p><p><span style="">-L They had taken a backseat until now, while they harvested honey inside their hunting grounds. &#xA0;It wouldn&#x2019;t be a good look if they broadcasted this.</span></p><p><span style="">-L I&#x2019;d rather watch the Hahoe Mask&#x2019;s video later. &#xA0;Live channel? &#xA0;What a farce.</span></p><p><span style="">-L Let&#x2019;s just give the Hahoe Mask a live channel!</span></p><p><span style="">-LL I agree.</span></p><p><span style="">-LL I agree (2).</span></p><p><span style="">The 30 great guilds, who possessed the live channels, had no rights to broadcast this event.</span></p><p><span style="">They had purposefully allowed the tyranny of the Barbarian King to continue, and most of the 30 great guilds had enjoyed playing the game inside the hunting grounds they owned.</span></p><p><span style="">Hahoe Mask and the regular Users were making history, yet the 30 great guilds didn&#x2019;t have the right to profit off of it.</span></p><p><span style="">The battle on the stage of the Bizma Plain was for the regular Users. &#xA0;It was for Users, who looked beyond profit. &#xA0;It was a stage where their dreams, hopes and will was gathered.</span></p><p><span style="">In many ways, they were purely here to play the game.</span></p><p><span style="">Was this the reason why? </span></p><p><span style="">&apos;It is a grand spectacle.&apos;</span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan watched the stage as he kept his breathing steady. &#xA0;He waited for his upcoming battle. &#xA0;In Hyrkan&#x2019;s eyes, this battle shone more brightly than any other battle.</span></p><p><span style="">Grand Spectacle.</span></p><p><span style="">This was true whether it was before he came to the past or after.</span></p><p><span style="">He had participated in countless battles, yet he never saw a stage that shone as brightly as this one.</span></p><p><span style="">&apos;This is a grand spectacle.&apos;</span></p><p><span style="">There were over five thousand Users gathered here. &#xA0;They were throwing magic, swinging swords, raising shields and praying for a single User.</span></p><p><span style="">Moreover, this was only the beginning.</span></p><p><span style="">They would continue to fight, and the battle wouldn&apos;t even allow them to take a breather. &#xA0;At the very least, they would have to fight for an hour.</span></p><p><span style="">Of course, there would be some Users, who would log out, after giving up on this painful battle. &#xA0;There would also be some Users, who ran away.</span></p><p><span style="">On the other hand, a significant amount of Users had already accepted the risk of a Game Over. &#xA0;They would fight until death.</span></p><p><span style="">Most of the Users, who died here, would suffer losses. &#xA0;No one would acknowledge their deaths. &#xA0;They would record a Game Over, and they would have to suffer the consequences in real life by being barred from the game for 48 hours.</span></p><p><span style="">The 30 great guilds compensated the Users, who died in a Raid, and the Hahoe Mask style of battle was a high risk, high reward method. &#xA0;The regular Users were different. &#xA0;Their motivations were purer</span></p><p><span style="">&apos;Yes, I always wanted to fight on a stage like this.&apos;</span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan had dreamed about this sight.</span></p><p><span style="">He had dreamed about this stage.</span></p><p><span style="">He had wanted to be the main character where the Users created the stage for him. &#xA0;They would cheer him on as they sacrificed their lives for no cost.</span></p><p><span style="">&apos;This type of stage&#x2026;&#x2026;&apos;</span></p><p><span style="">It had been the same even before he returned to the past. &#xA0;He had wanted to be on the brightest stage with the Hahoe Mask guild. &#xA0;He wanted to stand here with the people, who had suffered with him. &#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;Moreover, he wanted to leave behind a legacy with those people on a stage like this.</span></p><p><span style="">This was why the sense of betrayal he had felt had cut much deeper. &#xA0;He had wanted to watch this sight with them, yet they had betrayed him. &#xA0;Maybe this was why he violently rebelled against everyone.</span></p><p><span style="">&apos;Hnng.&apos;</span></p><p><span style="">Of course, the memory from back then would not be put into the collection of memories he wanted to reminisce. &#xA0;No, he would no longer be beholden to those memories. &#xA0;Today will be the last day he&#x2019;ll feel regret and anger from that memory.</span></p><p><span style="">&apos;Yes, my choice wasn&#x2019;t wrong.&apos;</span></p><p><span style="">He had no reason to regret now.</span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan put a Timer Bone Explosive within the Bone Dragon&#x2019;s body. &#xA0;Afterwards, he looked behind at the Skeleton Warriors, who were line up with their Bone Armors equipped.</span></p><p><span style="">The moment where Hyrkan would have to perform was approaching.</span></p>
