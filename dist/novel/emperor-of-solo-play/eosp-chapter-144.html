<p>Chapter 144 - The Frozen Land (3)</p><p>8.</p><p><span style="">An accident can happen in an instant.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I accept the guild war!&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Natal was thinking hard to find out Hyrkan&apos;s hidden intent. &#xA0;The rest of the guild members felt nervous and threatened by Hyrkan&apos;s confidence, which bordered on being arrogant. &#xA0;Apollo didn&apos;t bother to think. &#xA0;He felt numb, and he immediately spat out the emotion he was feeling with his words.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Attack!&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">He let out a shout of determination, but there was no substance behind it. &#xA0;Apollo&apos;s shout was met with a more colder reaction than the blizzard surrounding them. &#xA0;Apollo felt desolate, and this feeling of desolation lasted a quite a long time.</span></p><p><span style="">Apollo felt taken aback after he spoke those words. &#xA0;Of course, Apollo wasn&apos;t taken aback, because he realized he had a mistake.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Why aren&apos;t they moving?&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">He had given an order, yet no one was doing anything. &#xA0;This was why he was taken aback.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I accept the guild war.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">With those words, Hyrkan opened his arms wide.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Yes, Apollo. &#xA0;I put my trust in you.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan had opened his two arms wide, and he felt like giving a big hug to the the corpulent body of Apollo.</span></p><p><span style="">From the perspective of the Big Smiles&#x2019; guild members, they could see the armor beneath Hyrkan&apos;s white leather fur coat when he spread his arm wide.</span></p><p><span style="">Gulp! </span></p><p><span style="">Someone swallowed their spit.</span></p><p><span style="">It was the armor worn by the White-eyed Knight Argardo, who had terrorized everyone in the great battle. &#xA0;There was no way they could mistake it for some other armor. &#xA0;There was a black colored blot that moved atop the silver armor like a living carp. &#xA0;There was only one such armor in all of Warlord.</span></p><p><span style="">Of course, the sword sheath attached to the armor probably held Argardo&apos;s sword. &#xA0;It was probably the Crying Sword.</span></p><p><span style="">These facts in itself gave them a feeling of intense pressure. &#xA0;The Big Smiles guild members felt overwhelmed, and it started causing them to feel fear.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;It brings up a bad memory.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Shit. &#xA0;That Item setting is a cheat.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">The Big Smiles guild had also faced Argardo. &#xA0;Most of the members gathered here had participated in the battle with Argardo. &#xA0;None of them directly fought Argardo, but they had seen, felt and heard Argardo&apos;s imposing presence.</span></p><p><span style="">The Hahoe Mask was wearing Argardo&apos;s armor&#x2026;&#x2026;. </span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;I don&apos;t want to fight him.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;The first ones to attack him will all die.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan was a monster that was much more scarier than most large sized Boss Monsters. &#xA0;How many Users in Warlord would be able to attack Hyrkan unhesitatingly? &#xA0;Moreover, a sacrificial lamb was need in any action they took. &#xA0;No one wanted to volunteer themselves to become the sacrificial lamb.</span></p><p><span style="">If one wanted a sacrificial lamb to step forward, one needed leadership and charisma. &#xA0;The leader needed respect from his men. &#xA0;Apollo had none of these traits. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;They won&apos;t attack me?&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">At that moment, Hyrkan looked at the frozen Big Smiles guild members, and he turned his back on them.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Uh?&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">This was the moment right before the start of a battle.</span></p><p><span style="">If this was a battlefield, where one used guns, someone would have already prematurely fired one&apos;s gun. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">It was a time when the Hahoe Mask and the Big Smiles would exchange killing intent.</span></p><p><span style="">Yet Hyrkan chose to turn his back on them? &#xA0;Everyone blankly stared at Hyrkan&apos;s back. &#xA0;Hyrkan disappeared into the blizzard. &#xA0;They couldn&apos;t see the Skeleton Warriors either.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What the hell are you guys doing! &#xA0;Get him!&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Apollo once again let out a shout.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;It is an order! &#xA0;Go get the Hahoe Mask! &#xA0;I&apos;ll give a penalty to any bastard, who doesn&apos;t follow my order!&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">At this point, his shouts were more of a threat than an order. &#xA0;The Big Smiles guild members took their time as they moved towards the direction where the Hahoe Mask had disappeared.</span></p><p><span style="">Natal let out a bitter laugh when he saw this.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Did he plan this out too?&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Go get his watch.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">At his words, a single User approached Sohank&apos;s corpse. &#xA0;The wristwatches of Sohank and Sinclair was untouched.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;If he took the watches, we could have used it as a pretext.... &#xA0;However, there is no way he would show such a weak point...&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">Hahoe Mask hadn&apos;t left behind the watches, because he was kind.</span></p><p><span style="">From one to ten, all of the Hahoe Mask&apos;s actions had a purpose and preparation behind it.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Are we going to fight?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Fight whom?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;That&#x2026;&#x2026;.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">They were still not used to this blizzard raging in this world. &#xA0;In such a world, Hyrkan had prepared leather clothes lined with white fur on the outside. &#xA0;The Hahoe Mask had come out of nowhere, but he was prepared to camouflage himself by wearing that color. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">Who in their right mind would want to face such an opponent in a battle?</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;We are giving up on the Northland exploration.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Natal was confident that he strategize a win in a battle against the Hahoe Mask. &#xA0;However, he wasn&apos;t confident he could win in this particular battlefield.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;We don&apos;t have to add stupidity to our incompetence.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">As Natal said those words, he looked at Apollo, who was jumping up and down in anger near Sinclair&apos;s body.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;He wasn&apos;t a genius tracker. &#xA0;He was a patsy that was very easy to use.&#x2019;</span></p><p>9.</p><p><span style="">Hyrkan didn&apos;t particularly like the snowfields. &#xA0;In the past, he had suffered numerous troubles on the snowfield by the Storm hunters.</span></p><p><span style="">However, it was a different story if there was a blizzard. &#xA0;The blizzard restricted one&apos;s vision, and it dulled one&apos;s senses. &#xA0;Moreover, there were various additional penalties when one stepped onto this harsh land...</span></p><p><span style="">How many Users in Warlord would able to differentiate Hyrkan&#x2019;s tracks from the tracks of the Skeletons in such conditions?</span></p><p><span style="">Moreover, Hyrkan&apos;s Skeleton underlings weren&apos;t normal Skeletons. &#xA0;&#xA0;They weren&#x2019;t just bones. &#xA0;They were Warriors equipped with expensive Items that most normal Users couldn&#x2019;t even procure.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Shit! &#xA0;Those are Skeleton Warriors!&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Be mindful of your surrounding!&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">The Strikers and Tankers was carefully following the tracks when they became frightened. &#xA0;It was the moment when their battle with the Skeleton Warriors had started.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;It is an ambush!&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">The Skeleton Warriors had been on standby behind them, and they ambushed the Priests and Magicians.</span></p><p><span style="">This was the 7th battle that had been conducted abruptly. &#xA0;The score of this battle was 2 vs 10. &#xA0;Ten Skeleton Warriors were crushed, and two Big Smiles guild members suffered a Game Over.</span></p><p><span style="">If one went by numbers, it would be a clear victory for them. &#xA0;However, the Big Smiles guild members&apos; faces were frozen like the snow-chilled wind.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;The Priests&#x2026;&#x2026; We have one left.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;One Priest won&apos;t be able to cover for all the Users here.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;We also have only 4 Magicians left.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Hahoe Mask wasn&apos;t amongst any of the enemies they had killed. &#xA0;This fact wouldn&apos;t be changed through Magic or even if their Cool Time had been reset. &#xA0;It basically meant they had to fight this battle until their eventual death.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;This is ridiculous.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">A force of almost 30 people was facing off against a single User. This should be ridiculously easy.</span></p><p><span style="">However, when they started fighting the Hahoe Mask, they found out that they were the ones that was ridiculously to kill. &#xA0;It felt as if they were the weaker foe that was being dominated.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What did officer Apollo say?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;He ranted about catching the Hahoe Mask at all cost.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;If he wants to catch the Hahoe Mask so bad, he should do it himself. &#xA0;We even had to leave behind a Striker and a Priest to guard....&#x2026;&#x2026;.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">The weak could only complain when placed in a disadvantageous situation. &#xA0;However, this frozen land didn&apos;t even allow them the luxury to complain.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I&apos;m in Cool Time.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Cool Time? &#xA0;I&apos;m about to receive the penalty for the Frostbite!&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I&apos;m in Cool Time. &#xA0;It is out of my hands!&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">They were down to a single Priest. &#xA0;It basically meant the number of Users that could receive the Resistance skill had lessened.</span></p><p><span style="">The group had avoided any critical penalties thanks to the Buff Skills laid on them by the Priests. &#xA0;However, now they would have face the true character of this frosty land.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;We&apos;ll just freeze to death here.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Despair. </span></p><p><span style="">If they had a choice, they wanted to run away. &#xA0;However, they were scared of the guild penalties. &#xA0;They couldn&apos;t run away. &#xA0;In the end, the only thing they could do was to protect the Priest and Magicians. &#xA0;They moved the Priest and Magicians to the center, and they clustered around each other. &#xA0;That was all they did.</span></p><p><span style="">This wasn&apos;t a pursuit. &#xA0;They were just slowly meandering from one place to another.</span></p><p><span style="">However, the being that found them was far from being a blue bird. &#xA0;It was a Wyvern Fire Golem with flames surrounding it.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;This is crazy!&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Shield! Use the Shield Magic!&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">This was their first time experiencing such an attack, so they didn&apos;t know how to react to it.</span></p><p><span style="">Kwa-ahng! </span></p><p><span style="">The Wyvern Fire Golem dived towards the ground, and it immediately exploded. &#xA0;There was only a single Shield Magic active, and it acted as an umbrella that blocked the explosion. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">However, the only ones that were able to benefit from the umbrella was 2 Magicians and a Priest.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Shit!&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Unexpectedly, there were no casualties. &#xA0;This was the Fire Golem&apos;s special skill. &#xA0;The Kamikaze Explosion skill was powerful, but everyone gathered here were over level 160. &#xA0;Moreover, they were a equipped with decent Item Settings.</span></p><p><span style="">However, the problem was their formation. &#xA0;It had crumbled. &#xA0;They had created a formation that would have protected the Magicians and Priest, but now they were all scattered.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Are you guys ok?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I&apos;m all right!&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Did anyone die? &#xA0;Who&apos;s hurt?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">In the midst of the broken formation, the guild members asked each other if they were ok.</span></p><p><span style="">The Skeleton Warriors on standby used this moment to throw their Bone Spears with all their might.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Those are Bone Spears!&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">The Big Smiles guild members had been taken aback by the Kamikaze attack. &#xA0;Now they were in a state of panic as Bone Spears flew towards them.</span></p><p><span style="">An Ogre Golem, two Skeleton Knights and 15 Skeleton Warriors charged towards this scene of chaos.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hahoe Mask?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ah&#x2026;&#x2026;.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">This time the Hahoe Mask was in the middle of the group.</span></p><p><span style="">In the previous seven ambushes, Hyrkan hadn&apos;t appeared. &#xA0;However, he was here now, and it was the surest sign that heralded his victory.</span></p><p>10.</p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Why couldn&apos;t over twenty of them catch a single Users!&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Wiped. </span></p><p><span style="">He received the news of this ridiculous result through messages from his dead guild members. &#xA0;Apollo was was feeling all kinds of emotions. &#xA0;He was feeling rage, dejection, worry, irritation, etc. &#xA0;He was having a hard time maintaining a sane mind.</span></p><p><span style="">He was at a higher level than the time he ran a guild named after himself. &#xA0;He was here with a party consisting of almost 30 outstanding Users. &#xA0;He couldn&apos;t believe they were being trampled in such a shameful manner.</span></p><p><span style="">Moreover, it was done by the Hahoe Mask, who he hated the most. &#xA0;Apollo decided to avoid facing the reality.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;The 30 great guilds aren&apos;t that great. &#xA0;How can they get wiped out by one User?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">As he spat out his complaints, Apollo started to back away. &#xA0;A Striker and a Priest had been left behind to protect him. &#xA0;Cho-oohroong yelled out towards Apollo, who had been about to disappear by himself.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Where are you going?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;We failed, so why should I stay in this cold place! &#xA0;We are heading back!&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Apollo accepted this battle as a loss. &#xA0;He planned on just leaving this freezing land.</span></p><p><span style="">At that moment, Cho-oohroong was about to speak.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Isn&apos;t this a battle where it&apos;ll continue until one side is completely eradicated?&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">Hahoe Mask was very clear in his words. &#xA0;This battle won&apos;t end until the other side was decimated.</span></p><p><span style="">There was no white flags in this. &#xA0;The only way one could signal defeat was through a Game Over.</span></p><p><span style="">Yet Apollo was trying to leave this stage right now?</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Crazy bastard!&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">He could try leaving this place. &#xA0;He wouldn&apos;t stop Apollo. </span></p><p><span style="">However, will the Hahoe Mask really allow Apollo and his guards to retreat so easily?</span></p><p><span style="">Cho-oohroong gritted his teeth. &#xA0;If this was the Hahoe Mask he knew, he wasn&#x2019;t merciful. &#xA0;He hadn&apos;t heard a single instance where the Hahoe Mask had shown mercy.</span></p><p><span style="">Cho-oohroong&apos;s thoughts eventually became reality.</span></p><p>11.</p><p><span style="">When a news was kept quiet, it usually stayed quiet. &#xA0;However, once a story starts to move, it spreads at an astonishing speed.</span></p><p><span style="">The news regarding the fight in the Northland was the same.</span></p><p><span style="">The first news to spread was about Hyrdra guild&apos;s Northland expedition.</span></p><p><span style="">- The Hydra guild is the first to send an expedition to Northland</span></p><p><span style="">- Northland? &#xA0;I thought no one could reach there? </span></p><p><span style="">- &#x3134; They got there by crossing the Terube castle wall.</span></p><p><span style="">- &#x3134; I guess everyone will be crossing the Terube castle wall now.</span></p><p><span style="">Previously, everyone had a lot of interest in the Northland, but they didn&apos;t know how to get there. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">&apos;As expected of the Hydra guild!&apos;</span></p><p><span style="">This was the words spoke by others.</span></p><p><span style="">- The Big Smiles guild and the Hydra guild fought for the Northland, and the Big Smiles won.</span></p><p><span style="">The next bit of news was immediately released afterwards. &#xA0;This shocking news engulfed all conversations regarding Warlord.</span></p><p><span style="">The news of the Hydra and Big Smiles fighting for the rights for the Northland exploration was surprising in itself. &#xA0;However, the fact that the Big Smiles was the victor in the battle was more shocking.</span></p><p><span style="">- Sohank lost! </span></p><p><span style="">- My god. &#xA0;Who took down Sohank? </span></p><p><span style="">- The Big Smiles did it?</span></p><p><span style="">Moreover, Sohank was one of the strongest Strikers in Warlord. &#xA0;He was the Second Head of the Hydra guild, and he had lost in a 1on1 battle.</span></p><p><span style="">The Big Smiles was considered to be the doormat of the 30 great guilds. &#xA0;One of the critical weakness they had was the fact that they didn&apos;t have a powerful ace. &#xA0;The victory of the Big Smiles guild would surely bring big changes to the fate of the Big Smiles guild.</span></p><p><span style="">- Sinclair? Who the hell is that? </span></p><p><span style="">- It is another new face? </span></p><p><span style="">The Big Smiles guild&apos;s stock was steeply rising. &#xA0;Most people had guessed that the Northland exploration would be the starting point to the Main Scenario Quest, and the Big Smiles guild had gained the rights to this location.</span></p><p><span style="">Moreover, the User that had made this happen was Sinclair. &#xA0;His fame grew. &#xA0;Instead of praise, most Users were feeling nervous at the appearance of such a User.</span></p><p><span style="">However, an incident occurred that wiped away this one User&apos;s existence off the map.</span></p><p><span style="">- The Hahoe Mask fought a guild war with the Big Smiles guild. &#xA0;The Hahoe Mask gained the rights!</span></p><p><span style="">- What the hell are you talking about? &#xA0;What do you mean by a guild war? </span></p><p><span style="">- Was it a 1on1 battle? &#xA0;Sinclair vs Hahoe Mask? </span></p><p><span style="">- &#x3134; No. &#xA0;It was 1 vs 30.</span></p><p><span style="">- &#x3134; One vs 30? &#xA0;Hahoe Mask and 30 Skeletons took down Sinclair?</span></p><p><span style="">The Hahoe Mask had become the owner of the Northland.</span></p><p><span style="">The Skeleton Warrior holding a bag full of wrist watches, Ingredient Coins and Gems stopped walking.</span></p><p><span style="">It had come to a stop, because its owner had come to a stop.</span></p><p><span style="">Its owner raised his head, and he looked into the great darkness that could be seen inbetween the blizzard.</span></p><p><span style="">The darkness turned out to be a castle wall. &#xA0;It was as if the castle wall was cutting the world in half. &#xA0;It was hard to estimate how long it was. &#xA0;Even the fierce blizzard bowed its head against this castle wall. &#xA0;He raised his head to look up, and it was hard to see where the castle wall ended.</span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan smiled as he saw the castle wall that boasted an overwhelming dignity.</span></p><p><span style="">In the end, Hyrkan started walking again.</span></p><p><span style="">[You have entered the border of the Frozen Kingdom.] </span></p><p><span style="">He heard the Announcements. </span></p><p><span style="">[You&apos;ve earned the Title &apos;Visitor of the Frozen Kingdom&apos;.] </span></p><p><span style="">[You&apos;ve earned the Title &apos;Great Explorer of the Northland&apos;.] </span></p><p><span style="">[You&apos;ve earned the Title &apos;Pioneer of this Era.&apos;] </span></p><p><span style="">It had been 20 days since he had left the Terube castle wall. &#xA0;The Announcements notified him that he had reached his destination.</span></p>
