<p>Chapter 141 - Across the Terube Castle Wall (2)</p><p><span style="">4.</span></p><p><span style="">- How&apos;s the battle going?</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;It&#x2019;s been very rough.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">- How&apos;s the Quest progress?</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;We haven&#x2019;t had the luxury to assess the Quest progress.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">- I guess the difficulty is higher than expected?</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">- Did you gain anything? &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">Natal, who had been having a conversation with the First Head, turned his head. &#xA0;The corpses of the monsters came into view.</span></p><p><span style="">They hadn&apos;t butchered it yet, so the corpses hadn&apos;t melted like ice cream. &#xA0;They still maintained their original form. &#xA0;There were a lot of variety of monster corpses. &#xA0;At a glance, he could see 7 types of monsters. &#xA0;It was hard to find any common characteristics between them. &#xA0;They were all distinct.</span></p><p><span style="">The most eye-catching one was the giant that was almost 5 meters tall. &#xA0;It had a single eye, and its skull was shaped like the head of a hammer. &#xA0;It looked bizarre.</span></p><p><span style="">The next monster that caught his eye was a 2 meter tall monkey that had a paper thin body. &#xA0;Its body looked so skinny that it was reminiscent of a wooden branch. &#xA0;Moreover, if one touched its skin, one wouldn&#x2019;t be able to tell the difference between the texture of its skin and a tree.</span></p><p><span style="">Then there was a beautiful looking monster that was a stark contrast to previous bizarre looking monsters.</span></p><p><span style="">It gave off a brilliant feeling like a crystal. &#xA0;Its claws were crescent-shaped, and it was 2 meters long with white fur. &#xA0;It didn&apos;t look like a monster. &#xA0;Instead, it looked like a animal that appeared in myths and legends.</span></p><p><span style="">Natal looked over the corpses, and he opened his mouth.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I did.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Of course, these different types of monsters hadn&apos;t attack them all at the same time. &#xA0;The monsters each attacked on their own, and they had just gathered the corpses to one side.</span></p><p><span style="">The reason behind this was obvious. &#xA0;It was for research.</span></p><p><span style="">- Should I expect anything? </span></p><p><span style="">It was the basic of basics to research about a new monster. &#xA0;A proper video showing how to defeat these monsters had immediately monetary value. &#xA0;It could be exploited. &#xA0;This was especially true for the Hydra guild, since they used information as a weapon. &#xA0;Their ability to gather data was peerless.</span></p><p><span style="">This was why Natal was careful in answering the First Head&apos;s question.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;You should both anticipate and worry about the result.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">- That&apos;s an interesting answer. </span></p><p><span style="">Interesting&#x2026;&#x2026; &#xA0;It basically meant he wanted an additional explanation.</span></p><p><span style="">At that moment, Natal re-winded his memory a little further back. &#xA0;He thought about the time when he decided to investigate the Northland.</span></p><p><span style="">It was the end of the Immoral Prince, and the interest of the Users naturally shifted to the third Main Scenario Quest. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">Where was the starting point of the third Main Scenario Quest?</span></p><p><span style="">North, South, East and West. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">It&apos;ll be located in one of those directions.</span></p><p><span style="">Hyrdra guild decided to focus on two directions. They went North and East.</span></p><p><span style="">However, the North held more significance since the Northland was located there. &#xA0;It had been the territory ruled by Prince Dean. &#xA0;If Prince Dean gained power away from the eyes of others, there was a very high possibility that he gained it in Northland where he had been in charge.</span></p><p><span style="">This was why the Hyrdra guild put more meaning and gravity to the North expedition. &#xA0;This was why the Hyrdra guild&apos;s best fighting asset was included within the expedition group. &#xA0;Aside from Sohank, there were 33 other Users included in the Northland expedition team. &#xA0;Their basic battle capability was high, and they were excellent in many other aspects too.</span></p><p><span style="">Their Raiding ability was lacking in comparison to the primary Raid team, but in terms of exploring and regular battles, this force was better than the primary Raid team.</span></p><p><span style="">However, after a single week into the expedition, they felt as if the stage they stepped onto was too much for them. &#xA0;The monsters here were strong.</span></p><p><span style="">These were different types of monsters compared to the ones they had faced before. &#xA0;There were a lot of differences on many fronts.</span></p><p><span style="">These corpses, which was about to be turned into ice cream, were a prime examples.</span></p><p><span style="">This Hammerhead Giant used its hammerhead to use a Head-butt attack. &#xA0;It was a bizarre form of attack. &#xA0;The Deadwood Monkey&apos;s camouflage ability was so good that it was chilling. &#xA0;Moreover, it possessed a poisonous stinger. &#xA0;For an opponent, it was the worst possible combination of skills to face.</span></p><p><span style="">New methods would have to be devised to defeat them.. &#xA0;Still, in another light, this could might drive up the anticipation and fun they would have in fighting them.</span></p><p><span style="">The problem was the white furred fox named Crystal Crescent Fox.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;We caught the white furred fox in the forest.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">- Did you kill only one?</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;They don&apos;t travel in a pack, but we caught three of them.</span></p><p><span style="">- So it isn&apos;t a rare monster.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;We shouldn&apos;t have found it in a forest. &#xA0;They shouldn&apos;t be living here.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Even in reality, beasts were tailored to the region they live in. &#xA0;However, the monsters in Warlord didn&apos;t always suit their environment perfectly.</span></p><p><span style="">However, most of their characteristics were optimized for their habitat. </span></p><p><span style="">The Deadwood Monkey exemplified this concept. &#xA0;It was dressed to function most optimally in forests. &#xA0;It wasn&apos;t a rare monster, and he had seen several of them nearby.</span></p><p><span style="">The fox basically pointed to a single answer.</span></p><p><span style="">- Snowfield&#x2026;&#x2026; It is worth being concerned about it.</span></p><p><span style="">A monster that should be at a different stage was in this environment through some special circumstances.</span></p><p><span style="">What kind of stage goes well with the white fur? &#xA0;A white environment goes well with it.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes. &#xA0;I&apos;m pretty sure a snowfield will appear soon.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Snowfield.</span></p><p><span style="">There wasn&apos;t some incredible meaning behind those words. &#xA0;It was a snowfield. &#xA0;&#xA0;It was a sight one could see easily in real life.</span></p><p><span style="">However, up until now, no serious amount of monsters had appeared in a snowfield or a desert field. Tobo Soft hadn&apos;t officially explained why, but most Users had an idea on the reason behind it.</span></p><p><span style="">- You&apos;ll be working hard.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;If it&apos;s just working hard, I&#x2019;ll count it as a blessing.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">The level of difficulty would be unprecedented.</span></p><p><span style="">Let&#x2019;s say there was a person that could run a 100 meters in 9 seconds. &#xA0;If this person ran on a snowfield or a sand pit, how much time would be added to the overall time? &#xA0;It was the same concept for the battles. &#xA0;Unless one is able to fight from midair, the snow or sand would sharply increase the difficulty of a battle.</span></p><p><span style="">Of course, the high difficulty wasn&apos;t a problem in itself. &#xA0;This would actually increase the fun one would have on this new content. &#xA0;However, if the initial barrier was too high from the beginning, the Users wouldn&apos;t even dare to attempt it. &#xA0;This was a problem since the difficulty of Warlord was already high.</span></p><p><span style="">Such a content would arrive some day in the future.</span></p><p><span style="">Moreover, there was a high probability that they had already reached that point in time.</span></p><p><span style="">This was why Natal had said one would feel anticipation and worry at the same time. &#xA0;A new stage had appeared, and only the ones that could adapt the fastest would survive. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">- Then that means you are going to have to work hard.</span></p><p><span style="">The First Head was already aware of this truth, so he was brief with his words. &#xA0;He swallowed the words he had been about to say. &#xA0;He had been about to tell Natal about the immense difficulty being faced by the team climbing the Urugal mountain range. &#xA0;Natal already had a lot to worry about, so he didn&apos;t want to put extra burdens on him.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">After the call ended, Natal once again looked at the corpses of the monsters. &#xA0;Then he scrolled down his Title list, and he looked at the &apos;Noble Walk&apos; Title.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;The starting point is the same for everyone. &#xA0;However, I&apos;ve already left the starting line earlier than anyone else.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">He wasn&apos;t checking it to see if he still had it. &#xA0;He was looking at it to assure himself.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;There is no reason why we&apos;ll come out behind.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">They had started out before everyone else, so there was no way they could get overtaken. &#xA0;This was the message behind his self-assurance.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;I have nothing to worry about. &#xA0;I have nothing to worry....&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">Natal used this self-assurance to calm his restless heart.</span></p><p>5.</p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Javelin throw!&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">These were three meter long spears being raised from between the trees. &#xA0;There were 10 in total, and the bearers of these spears were in a formation. &#xA0;They were spread apart forming a parabola. &#xA0;At the opening of the parabola, there were goblins wearing bone armors. &#xA0;It was the Bone Armor Goblins.</span></p><p><span style="">Kwah-jeek! </span></p><p><span style="">Rough sounds were emitted when bone impacted on bone.</span></p><p><span style="">Ggee-eek, ggee-eek! </span></p><p><span style="">Afterward, the Bone Armor Goblins let out a cry of anger.</span></p><p><span style="">The Bone Spears hadn&apos;t caused much damage. The Bone Armors was made using the bones from other dead goblins. &#xA0;The Bone Armors boasted a high defense.</span></p><p><span style="">However, these were made from their treasured fellow goblins, so it was important to them. &#xA0;They didn&#x2019;t want their Bone Armors to get damaged. &#xA0;It was a special characteristic of the Bone Armor Goblins. &#xA0;Their attack power went up as the Bone Armors deteriorated.</span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan was very well-acquainted with this fact. &#xA0;In the past, he had studied all the videos released by the Stormhunters. &#xA0;The memory on how to defeat the Bone Armor Goblins were still present inside his mind.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;After you rile these bastards up, they&apos;ll go crazy if they see a sandbag.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">At that moment, an enormous turtle charged towards the Bone Armor Goblins at a decent pace. &#xA0;The group of 25 Bone Armor Goblins were so incensed that they had a tunnel vision. &#xA0;They had set their hearts on the Turtle Golem, so they charged towards it.</span></p><p><span style="">The result of their actions was revealed immediately.</span></p><p><span style="">Poohk! </span></p><p><span style="">The weapon in the Bone Armor Goblin&apos;s hand were made by sharpening the leg bones of their dead comrades. &#xA0;The Bone Knives were stabbed into the Turtle&apos;s shell as if it was slicing into a rotten daikon. &#xA0;In a flash, the Turtle Golem resembled a hedgehog. &#xA0;However, the Bone Armor Goblins weren&apos;t satisfied with stabbing it only once. &#xA0;They stuck to the Turtle&apos;s Shell, and they started swinging their Bone Knives as if they had gone mad.</span></p><p><span style="">At such a devastating sight, Hyrkan didn&apos;t show any signs of loss. &#xA0;Instead, he yelled out with a little bit of an excitement in his voice.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hardening!&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">The Turtle Golem immediately turned into stone.</span></p><p><span style="">Ggoohk! </span></p><p><span style="">In the process of Hardening, several Bone Knives of the Bone Armor Goblins became stuck in the Turtle Golem&apos;s body.</span></p><p><span style="">Ggeeeeeeeek! </span></p><p><span style="">The ones with their Bone Knife stuck let out a keening cry as they tried to dislodge it.</span></p><p><span style="">Ggee-eek! &#xA0;Ggeek! </span></p><p><span style="">Even the ones that didn&apos;t have their Bone Knives stuck were letting out the cry, and they continued to swing their Bone Knives at the Turtle Golem.</span></p><p><span style="">Kwah-jeek, kwah-jeek.</span></p><p><span style="">One could hear the Bone Knives chipping away at the stone.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;They are in a frenzy.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">Every one of them were interested only in the sandbag that had turned into stone. &#xA0;This was when Hyrkan, his Skeleton Knights and Skeleton Warriors moved in.</span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan and his Skeleton subordinates showed them the cost of being distracted. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">Shweek, kwah-jeeek, poohk.....</span></p><p><span style="">The weapons started causing wounds, and it sounded like a symphony played by an orchestra.</span></p><p><span style="">The outcome had already been decided.</span></p><p><span style="">All the Bone Armor Goblins received a critical strike. &#xA0;When they tried to change their targets, Hyrkan and his Skeleton underlings ramped up their attacks. &#xA0;He had gained an advantage, so he kept pushing to increase this advantage.</span></p><p><span style="">Kah-ahng! </span></p><p><span style="">The sound of weapons clashing with each other were heard. &#xA0;However, at some point, the weapons started to impact on living beings. &#xA0;It changed into sounds of flesh parting, and bones breaking. </span></p><p><span style="">It took him about 10 minutes to take down 25 Bone Armor Goblins.</span></p><p><span style="">[Your level has increased.] </span></p><p><span style="">After he ended the short battle, the Level Up Announcement was heard.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;My level up pace is good.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">This was the 183rd such announcement he had heard.</span></p><p><span style="">With the sound of the Announcement as background, Hyrkan smiled as he looked at the corpses of the Bone Armored Goblins.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;My condition is better.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">He had crossed the Terube castle wall and the nameless lake. &#xA0;He was immediately confronted with monsters over level 180. </span></p><p><span style="">Whether it was a large or small monsters that appeared in the past, there had been some common characteristics amongst all of them. &#xA0;However, new monsters were starting to appear with more frequency now. &#xA0;The previous strategies wouldn&#x2019;t work with them, and new strategies would have to be developed.</span></p><p><span style="">However, Hyrkan didn&apos;t need to worry about that. &#xA0;Hyrkan didn&apos;t need an adjustment time period.</span></p><p><span style="">Moreover, at that moment, Hyrkan was feeling something he had never felt before when playing a game.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;This feels exhilarating!&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">After the Immoral Prince episode had ended, Hyrkan hadn&apos;t participated in a full-scale battle. &#xA0;He only took down monsters he met as he moved from location to location.</span></p><p><span style="">This was the first earnest battle he had participated in a while. &#xA0;When he crossed the nameless lake, he had to use his combat powers at full effort.</span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan was surprised at his own combat efficacy in this battle.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;I never believed this day would come for me.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan had never thought he was weak. &#xA0;He was a monster if compared to the regular Users. &#xA0;However, every time Hyrkan went into battle he always had to worry about the risk of a Game Over. &#xA0;He always had to weigh the risk of a Game Over to any actions he took. &#xA0;He unconsciously avoided tasks that was risky enough to cause his death.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;I have no confidence as to whether I can actually die now.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">Currently, he couldn&apos;t come up with a risk that would drive him towards a Game Over.</span></p><p><span style="">He had the Earth Golem and Fire Golem. &#xA0;Then there was the 2 Skeleton Knights, and almost 40 Skeleton subordinates that could be summoned! </span></p><p><span style="">He had the Magic Power Stat to maintain this ridiculous army, and he could just use expensive consumables to supplement any deficiencies! &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">Lastly, he was equipped with the Chronicle Epic Items that he would have never dreamed of owning before! &#xA0;He just had to look at his own Specs!</span></p><p><span style="">These factors minimized the risk he felt in the front line. &#xA0;The word &#x2018;Risk&#x2019; had always been present in his mind, but now he could erase it from his mind.</span></p><p><span style="">These were battles without any risk of death. &#xA0;Of course, he would be in a good condition in such battles.</span></p><p><span style="">This was like an addicting drug for him.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;I can step on the accelerator, yet there is no way I&apos;ll crash. &#xA0;I don&apos;t have to drive safely anymore.&#x2019; &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan unhesitatingly put a magic recovery Item, which was worth 150 golds, into his mouth.</span></p><p><span style="">Bbah-doo-doohk! </span></p><p><span style="">He ate it in one bite instead of economizing it.</span></p><p><span style="">He didn&apos;t need to be thrifty. &#xA0;At this moment, he just wanted to continue this feeling he was having. &#xA0;That was the only thing in his mind. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">After he finished his recovery of his magical energy, Hyrkan let out a yell.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Follow me!&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan was the first unaccounted variable for the Hydra guild, who was still far ahead.</span></p><p>6.</p><p><span style="">Thirty people. </span></p><p><span style="">At a glance, one could tell they were equipped with expensive Items, and one could see a Smiling icon somewhere on their body, which identified them.</span></p><p><span style="">Big Smiles guild.</span></p><p><span style="">They were treated as the weakest in the 30 great guilds, but on the other hand, they still possessed the most guild members. &#xA0;They were still heads above the normal guilds, and they were beings that were high above in the sky for the normal Users.</span></p><p><span style="">The guild members affiliated to such a guild had appeared in front of the Terube castle wall.</span></p><p><span style="">Thirty Big Smiles guild members were gathered in front of the high castle wall, but none of them were intimidated by the sight.</span></p><p><span style="">They had seen this castle wall countless times before. &#xA0;Moreover, there was the hidden rookie, Cho-oohroong, who had conducted countless battles across the castle wall.</span></p><p><span style="">Including himself, Cho-oohroong was leading a group of 30.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;We&apos;ve received the Exploration Quest from Captain Bagel. &#xA0;We are allowed to go past the castle wall now.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Apollo nodded his head at Cho-oohroong&apos;s words.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Get ready everyone.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">At Apollo&#x2019;s words, the 28 Users tilted their bodies to look at a certain User for a signal. &#xA0;The User receiving all their gazes nodded his head lightly. &#xA0;It seemed Apollo was oblivious to all of this. &#xA0;He continued to speak. </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;As I&apos;ve said before, if you lack in skills and you lag behind, we will leave you behind. &#xA0;I want you guys to harden your heart. &#xA0;This is the biggest prey we&#x2019;ve hunted up to this point. &#xA0;It&#x2019;s the Hydra guild.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">There was a bloody smile on Apollo&#x2019;s lips. &#xA0;By the look of him, it seemed he would have taken down Hyrdra guild if he could do it on his own. &#xA0;Everyone sneered at his attitude.</span></p><p><span style="">Apollo&#x2019;s words made everyone mock him, and it wasn&#x2019;t a strange reaction.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Our guild is in a bad state. &#xA0;Some weird bastard became an officer, and now we have to listen to his commands.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;What a pig. &#xA0;I best he has a lot of money. &#xA0;How much did he spend to buy that officer&apos;s seat?&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">However, their mocking smiles disappeared every time they looked at a certain User.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Yes. &#xA0;He can only put our trust in him.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">This User&#x2019;s identity&#x2026;.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;We just have to believe in Sinclair-nim.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;We just have to set up the stage. &#xA0;Then Sinclair-nim will take down the Second Head.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">It was Sinclair.</span></p><p><span style="">The second unaccounted variable by the Hydra guild had shown up.</span></p>
