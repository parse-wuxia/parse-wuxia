<p>Chapter 143 - The Frozen Land (2)</p><p>3.</p><p><span style="">The blizzard was sweeping across the frozen land, and the blizzard wasn&apos;t just satisfied with blinding the intruders.</span></p><p><span style="">[A powerful coldness has swept over you. All Stats will be decreased by 10%.] </span></p><p><span style="">[After 19 minutes, you will get frost bites.] </span></p><p><span style="">[The powerful cold has swept over your armor, and the coldness will decrease its durability.] </span></p><p><span style="">[The powerful coldness has swept over you, and your senses have been dulled.] </span></p><p><span style="">This had never been experience anywhere on Warlord before. &#xA0;The intense cold was more terrifying than imagined. &#xA0;In this terrifying cold, two Users were facing each other. &#xA0;Sohank and Sinclair ignored the terrifying cold. &#xA0;They held swords that was almost impossible to determine the market prices. &#xA0;These expensive swords were pointed at each other.</span></p><p><span style="">This was their second meeting.</span></p><p><span style="">Of course, their first meeting hadn&apos;t been under such a dire situation. &#xA0;It had been a long time, since the two had met... &#xA0;They met during the time when the combined level of both Users were barely over level 100. &#xA0;It wasn&apos;t a long meeting. &#xA0;They just knew about each other&apos;s reputation. &#xA0;Since they were just curious about each other&apos;s reputation, they looked each other&apos;s face, and they parted after shaking hands. &#xA0;That was it.</span></p><p><span style="">There hadn&apos;t been any subsequent meetings. &#xA0;Most of the 30 great guilds asked for help from the Hands guild, but the Hydra guild was firm in not negotiating with them. &#xA0;Hydra guild put the most importance on gaining and protecting secrets. &#xA0;Of course, this was the stance they would take.</span></p><p><span style="">Even after such a long gap between their meetings, they didn&apos;t share any small talks. &#xA0;They were in a situation where they had to kill each other. &#xA0;They had no doubts in their hearts.</span></p><p><span style="">Strikers.</span></p><p><span style="">They always pierced through whatever that is in their way in the front lines. &#xA0;They was no reason why they should pay attention to their surrounding.</span></p><p><span style="">They only had one task to do here.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;I&apos;ll kill him.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;I&apos;ll end this.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">They had to find a way to kill the other User. &#xA0;That was it.</span></p><p>4.</p><p><span style="">There was why this frozen land was so harsh. &#xA0;There was no place to hide from the blizzard. &#xA0;If one stayed still, one would receive a penalty. &#xA0;Moreover, when one reached the point of getting frostbites, one&apos;s HP started to decrease. &#xA0;If one wanted a true rest in this frozen land, one had to make a shelter with one&apos;s hands.</span></p><p><span style="">The method was unexpectedly easy.</span></p><p><span style="">Igloo.</span></p><p><span style="">One had to gather a lot of snow to make a mound, and one had to dig in like a rabbit. &#xA0;The igloo was surprisingly snug.</span></p><p><span style="">Natal was within this snug space, and the felt disgusted at sharing the same space with the User next to him.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;The new officer of the Big Smiles, Apollo....&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">Apollo was standing next to Natal.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;I remember seeing his portrait, but I never thought he had such a skill.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">To state the obvious, Natal wasn&apos;t in the same Igloo as the other man, because he liked the other User.</span></p><p><span style="">It had been about two week since the Hydra guild had crossed to the other side of the Terube castle. The Big Smiles guild was close on the Hydra guild&apos;s tail. &#xA0;The two groups were within a distance that could be travelled within 24 hours. &#xA0;It took 24 hours for the field to reset. &#xA0;Basically, the Big Smiles guild was able to see the track left atop the snowfield. &#xA0;The chase had basically ended there.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;At a glance, he just looks like a greedy big....&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">The chase was pointless. &#xA0;The only thing left to do was to fight. &#xA0;This was why the two guilds agreed to a guild war.</span></p><p><span style="">The losing side would give up on exploring the Northland. &#xA0;Each side would pick a champion, and everything would come down to a 1on1 battle.</span></p><p><span style="">This wasn&apos;t anything special. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">An all-out guild war.... &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">In the past, the Big Smiles and Triple Wing guild had put their existence on the line as they performed a guild war. &#xA0;However, that kind of guild war rarely occurred. &#xA0;However, the guild war that was occurring right now happened quite frequently between the 30 great guilds.</span></p><p><span style="">It didn&apos;t make sense to fight an all-out battle for an owner-less mountain. &#xA0;It was better to determine the owner of the owner-less mountain through a single combat. &#xA0;This was the most profitable way to come to a decision. &#xA0;At the same time, if the 30 great guilds shed their bloods to claim ownership of this mountain, a third party would be reticent to object to the result. </span></p><p><span style="">When the deal was made, everyone except the combatants moved far away from the battle site. &#xA0;If one watched the battle from up close, it would just increase the probability of something disgraceful happening.</span></p><p><span style="">Above all else, this was a courtesy given to one&apos;s opponents. &#xA0;There would be no recordings allowed for this battle. &#xA0;This wasn&apos;t for personal glory. &#xA0;This was a fight for one&apos;s organization. &#xA0;There was no reason to clap for the winner, and there was no reason why they should console the loser. &#xA0;The only thing that needed to be recorded was the result of the fight.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;I never expected him to be a genius tracker.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">At that moment, Natal wasn&apos;t thinking about the guild war, Sohank or Sinclair. &#xA0;He was thinking about Apollo.</span></p><p><span style="">In truth, when Natal received the portrait, he hadn&apos;t even known that Apollo was an officer of Big Smiles. &#xA0;Moreover, he didn&apos;t want to waste space in remembering him. &#xA0;According to the information gathered by the Hydra guild, he wasn&apos;t anything special. &#xA0;He could be ignored.</span></p><p><span style="">However, a pursuit team led by Apollo had caught up to the Hydra guild in just a week.</span></p><p><span style="">Natal was shocked when he saw the Big Smiles&apos; guild symbol on Sinclair&apos;s chest, but the more surprising part was the fact that they had been tracked down so quickly.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I&apos;m guessing you are a new officer.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">This was why Natal had created this space.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;I have to find out if Apollo is the genius tracker or maybe it&apos;s someone else.... &#xA0;I have to find this out.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">Sohank was fighting for his guild with his life on the line, so of course, Natal had to use his own method to fight for his guild.</span></p><p><span style="">There was no way Apollo knew what Natal was thinking. &#xA0;Instead of an answering, Apollo smirked as he slightly nodded his head.</span></p><p><span style="">Apollo was overbearing as he sneered at Natal.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Does he have something?&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">His smile made Natal nervous. &#xA0;Natal was Hydra guild&apos;s Eight Head. &#xA0;The User in front of him was a new face to the Big Smiles guild. &#xA0;His position and reputation was all relatively new. &#xA0;There was no reason why Apollo should be looking at him in such an overbearing manner.</span></p><p><span style="">In other words, there was a high chance that something allowed Apollo to act in this overbearing manner.</span></p><p><span style="">Natal didn&apos;t get mad. &#xA0;He just continued the conversation.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Your skill is great. &#xA0;I can&apos;t believe you guys were able to track us down. &#xA0;There had been a great distance between us.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I just chased after someone that was very careless with his pouch. &#xA0;I wouldn&#x2019;t call that as having a great skill. &#xA0;It wasn&apos;t hard at all.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">After saying those words, Apollo overtly sneered at Natal. &#xA0;There was no deep reason behind his smile.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Hydra guild isn&apos;t that great.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">Apollo was able to raise his nose high into the air with impunity against a Head of the Hydra guild. &#xA0;It felt awesome.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Careless with one&apos;s pouch?&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">Natal had the opposite reaction when he heard Apollo&apos;s words. &#xA0;From Natal&apos;s disordered thoughts, a new suspicion was starting to build.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Perhaps?&#x2019; &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">Kah-ahng! </span></p><p><span style="">The ongoing blizzard was colorless.</span></p><p><span style="">Kwahng! </span></p><p><span style="">The ongoing blizzard looked drab.</span></p><p><span style="">On top of the white snowfield, Sohank and Sinclair was fighting a fierce battle. The snowfield was being greatly disturbed. &#xA0;Sword Energies was sent forth every time the Cool Time ended. &#xA0;The Sword Energies had the power to demolish the ground. &#xA0;No matter how severe this land was, it was impossible to maintain its pristine condition when the sword strikes impacted on the ground.</span></p><p><span style="">The harsh lands couldn&apos;t stand up against the sword strikes, and of course, the armors worn by the two Users couldn&apos;t be in a good state after facing such attacks.</span></p><p><span style="">At the very least, the armors were maintaining its original shape. &#xA0;The continuous attacks had laid bare the two Users&apos; arms and shoulders. &#xA0;It was hard to call those parts as being armored. &#xA0;The helmets were also dented and split open.</span></p><p><span style="">However, the swords they held were fine.</span></p><p><span style="">Both Users had the best weapons one could acquire. &#xA0;They didn&apos;t care if they fought with no armor! &#xA0;This was the resolve that befitted the two of the greatest Strikers in Warlord.</span></p><p><span style="">However, the part that was tormenting them the most wasn&apos;t the damage inflicted by others.</span></p><p><span style="">[You are frostbitten. &#xA0;Your health will quickly deteriorate.] </span></p><p><span style="">[In 10 minutes, you will be in a critical condition from the frostbite.] </span></p><p><span style="">[The coldness will start dominating your body. &#xA0;All Stats have decreased by 20%. &#xA0;Your movements have slowed.] </span></p><p><span style="">These wounds could easily be resolved by a Priest&apos;s Buff and Heal Skill. &#xA0;However, without the administration of a Priest, the prior wounds were turning into critical wounds.</span></p><p><span style="">Moreover, the two had promised beforehand. &#xA0;They agreed not to use any consumables.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;There are too many variables changing on this stage. &#xA0;Nothing good will come from taking my time.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;I shouldn&apos;t wait for luck to shift towards me. &#xA0;I have to end this with my skill.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">The two didn&apos;t want to lean on luck. &#xA0;They wanted to resolve this using their own skills. &#xA0;This was evidence that they were confident in their skills. &#xA0;At the same time, if luck was on the other&#x2019;s side, it would mean the other User had no chance of winning. &#xA0;This was the evidence of how much pressure was on them. &#xA0;One could never predict as to who the Lady Luck will smile on.</span></p><p><span style="">The battle continued as no one could easily seize the victory, and they were close to reaching their limits. &#xA0;They unconsciously started wishing for luck to be on their side.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;I don&apos;t care what it is. &#xA0;I want you to make a mistake.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;I can&apos;t lose here no matter what.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">At that moment, luck favored one side.</span></p><p><span style="">Kah-ahng!</span></p><p><span style="">Lady Luck smiled on Sinclair.</span></p><p><span style="">They were swinging their sword, and the sound of steel rang out as their swords collided with each other. &#xA0;Then a goosebump inducing sound like grinding teeth was heard. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">Ggee-dook ggeee-dook!</span></p><p><span style="">Sohank was starting to be pushed backwards.</span></p><p><span style="">Why was he being pushed back? &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">Instead of questioning his fortune, Sinclair let out a mighty shout, and he started pressing &#xA0;harder against Sohank. &#xA0;Sohank&apos;s arms flew backwards without him willing it to do so, and Sohank&apos;s chest was revealed. &#xA0;Sinclair executed a Body Slam.</span></p><p><span style="">Ggwah-gwahng! </span></p><p><span style="">Accompanying the loud sound, Sohank fell over backwards. &#xA0;Sinclair stepped on the chest of the fallen Sohank. &#xA0;He didn&apos;t make any small talks. &#xA0;Sinclair reversed his sword, and he brought it down. &#xA0;The sword headed towards Sohank&apos;s chest region.</span></p><p><span style="">Ggee-ee-ee! </span></p><p><span style="">The armor let out a sharp sound. &#xA0;It was the sound of steel being cut.</span></p><p><span style="">Poohk!</span></p><p><span style="">One could here the flesh being pierced.</span></p><p><span style="">When an expert reached their limits, one critical blow was enough to end the User.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;I won.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">Sohank suffered a Game Over. &#xA0;The first one to realized this was Sinclair, and at that moment, he was satisfied.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Finally, glory is in my hands.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">The satisfaction he felt was appropriate.</span></p><p><span style="">He had fought and won against a tough opponent. &#xA0;Moreover, it allowed him to achieve something he always wanted. &#xA0;He had suffered, and fought hard to feel this senses of satisfaction. &#xA0;Of course, he was content.</span></p><p><span style="">This feeling of contentment stole the tension from Sinclair&apos;s body.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;It&apos;s cold.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">He hadn&apos;t felt the cold before, but now he felt it. &#xA0;It was as if his skin was being cut... &#xA0;No, it wasn&apos;t that cold. &#xA0;Still, it was cold enough that it didn&apos;t feel good.</span></p><p><span style="">Sinclair turned his head to look at the raging blizzard. &#xA0;When he pierced through this blizzard, he would return to where everyone had stayed behind. &#xA0;He thought about the glory that would unfold in front of him. There was a smile around Sinclair&apos;s lips.</span></p><p><span style="">At that moment, the sight in front of Sinclair&apos;s eyes darkened.</span></p><p><span style="">[You have died.] </span></p><p><span style="">As Sinclair&apos;s world became dyed in black, he heard that short phrase.</span></p><p>6.</p><p><span style="">Two piece of news was delivered to both Natal and Apollo.</span></p><p><span style="">Natal received an apology from Sohank. &#xA0;Apollo received a message from Sinclair saying he&apos;s been ambushed by someone.</span></p><p><span style="">When they received those messages, both of them smashed through the igloo at the same time. &#xA0;Natal gritted his teeth when he came out into the blizzard.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;We lost everything.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">Sohank had lost. &#xA0;&#xA0;Now the Hydra guild will have to retreat from this frozen land. &#xA0;They&apos;ll have to return to the Terube castle wall.</span></p><p><span style="">They would be returning without gaining anything! </span></p><p><span style="">Natal thought about the time he had invested for this exploration quest. &#xA0;It wasn&apos;t a loss that he could just get over after being sick to the stomach. </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Everyone gather!&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Apollo was swept up in his rage. &#xA0;At Apollo&apos;s shout, the Big Smiles guild members gathered around him. &#xA0;Apollo shouted as if he wanted Natal to hear it.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;How dare you screw me over!&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Natal had become despondent, so he was having a hard time understanding Apollo&apos;s reaction.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;We won the match! &#xA0;So why did you take revenge on him?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Natal thought for a brief moment when he heard Apollo&apos;s question.</span></p><p><span style="">In such a volatile situation, Natal didn&apos;t have much time to think. &#xA0;Moreover, the questions he could ask at this moment was limited. &#xA0;Natal worked his brain hard in that short amount of time to come up with the most forthright and effective question.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Is Sinclair dead?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Do you plan on dodging the blame!&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Apollo&apos;s rage allowed the disarticulated thoughts inside Natal&apos;s head to start piecing itself together like puzzle pieces. &#xA0;The thoughts inside his head started finding its old pattern.</span></p><p><span style="">Ha ha.</span></p><p><span style="">Natal couldn&apos;t help, but laugh.</span></p><p><span style="">On the other side, Apollo was getting ready to immediately start a small guild war. &#xA0;It had been a one on one battle. &#xA0;They had won fair and square, yet a third combatant had interfered. &#xA0;Now Sinclair was dead. &#xA0;Apollo couldn&apos;t stand idly by.</span></p><p><span style="">As the atmosphere was getting harsh, Natal swallowed the sneer he was about to direct toward Apollo, and he spoke.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;It wasn&apos;t us.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Instead of answering, Apollo glared at Natal. &#xA0;When they heard Apollo&apos;s words, the Big Smiles guild members took out their weapons, and they started their Magic Casting. &#xA0;As if they sensed something was about to go down, the Hydra guild started getting ready for battle too.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Even if we had lost, we wouldn&apos;t have been such an underhanded losers like you.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Where&apos;s the proof?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Proof?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Natal retorted with a question to Apollo&apos;s words.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Do you have proof that we attacked Sinclair?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;If you look at the circumstances&#x2026;&#x2026;.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;You made a judgement after seeing only the circumstances. &#xA0;You only have circumstantial evidence yet you are willing to break the deal by attacking us?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">At this point, Apollo closed his mouth.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I&apos;ll say it again. &#xA0;I accept our defeat. &#xA0;The Hydra guild will pull out of the Northland.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Apollo&apos;s thoughts became complicated as Natal continued to speak.</span></p><p><span style="">The victor, Sinclair, &#xA0;had died from a sudden ambush. &#xA0;If one looked at the circumstances, the probability of the Hydra guild being behind the plot was high. &#xA0;Apollo determined the probability to be 99 percent.</span></p><p><span style="">On the other hand, the Hydra guild had just admitted defeat, and they were going to pull out of here. &#xA0;It would be foolish to ignore the previous deal to attack the Hydra guild first. &#xA0;It would be a burdensome act.</span></p><p><span style="">Moreover, their victory wouldn&#x2019;t be guaranteed by attacking first. &#xA0;It was a situation where the two guilds had lost their Ace Cards, and none of the other cards could guarantee a victory.</span></p><p><span style="">In the end, Apollo had achieved the desired result.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;I gained what I came here to gain.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">He had carried out a guild war against the Hydra guild, and he had won. &#xA0;Apollo&apos;s standing within Big Smiles guild would change after this.</span></p><p><span style="">In such a situation, he didn&apos;t want to force the issue.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Did they really not do this??&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">Of course, he still had questions. &#xA0;If the Hydra guild hadn&apos;t lashed out from their loss, then who killed Sinclair? &#xA0;Sinclair had been clear in his message. &#xA0;He said he had been ambushed.</span></p><p><span style="">Was he attacked by a monster? &#xA0;Or was there really a third party?</span></p><p><span style="">Natal was the one that resolved Apollo&apos;s worries.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;We&apos;ll find the answer when we get to the place where the two had fought.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Apollo yelled out instead of answering him. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Stand down!&#x201D;</span></p><p>7.</p><p><span style="">When the fierce battle died down, the battlefield started to be covered by snow.</span></p><p><span style="">This was why when the Hydra guild and Big Smiles guild arrived at their destination, they could barely see the traces left behind by the battle. &#xA0;Instead, they saw the two corpses lying next to each other, and someone was standing over them like a guardian.</span></p><p><span style="">It was a single User&#x2026;&#x2026; He was wearing leather clothes lined with white fur. &#xA0;In the blizzard, it was hard to make him out. &#xA0;However, Natal knew who this User was.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;It&apos;s the Hahoe Mask. &#xA0;Yes, if it was the Hahoe Mask....&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">There was only one User that would conspire against the 30 great guilds by himself. </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Who are you!&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">One didn&apos;t need to ask the question asked by Apollo if one had a decent head above their shoulders. &#xA0;One would be able to assess the situation.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;This isn&#x2019;t the first time we&apos;ve seen each other. &#xA0;It&apos;ll be more convenient for me if you are a little bit more quick on the uptake.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hahoe Mask?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">It was as Natal had surmised. &#xA0;The User in front of his eyes was the Hahoe Mask.</span></p><p><span style="">The Hahoe Mask had set this up. &#xA0;When he saw Sinclair with the Big Smiles, Hyrkan wanted them to fight Sohank and the Hydra guild. &#xA0;It worked out better than expected. &#xA0;They readily fought each other, and they died easier than he had expected.</span></p><p><span style="">At this point, Apollo and Natal diverged in their actions.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;How dare you, Hahoe Mask! &#xA0;Do you think you&apos;ll be fine after you meddled against the Big Smiles?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Apollo raged.</span></p><p><span style="">On the other hand, Natal thought over the situation.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;He didn&apos;t really have to reveal his role in this. &#xA0;The fact that he revealed himself.... &#xA0;He plans on taking further action.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">Instead of facing the conflicted Natal, Hyrkan dealt with the raging Apollo.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I don&apos;t have a good relationship with Big Smiles. &#xA0;Moreover, didn&apos;t you try to fuck me over in the past? &#xA0;Now I see you were from the Big Smiles.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan&apos;s finger was pointing at Cho-oohroong. &#xA0;It was impossible to see his face, since Cho-oohroong was wearing his helmet. &#xA0;However, Cho-oohroon unconsciously turned his gaze away when Hyrkan pointed at him. &#xA0;It was to be expected. &#xA0;There was something to feel guilty about.</span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan&apos;s finger slightly moved to point at Apollo. </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I also fought with you before. &#xA0;Your watch went to funding a good cause. &#xA0;Thank you. &#xA0;I always receive contributions from you. &#xA0;I&apos;m sorry.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;You bastard&#x2026;&#x2026;.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Apollo&apos;s body was shaking as he was about to lose his temper. &#xA0;Then Hyrkan&apos;s finger moved towards Sinclair&apos;s corpse, which was lying by his feet.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Also, I have a personal grievance with this one.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">This was the first time Natal opened his mouth. </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Are you talking about Sinclair?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Sinclair.</span></p><p><span style="">This was the first time Hyrkan had heard Sinclair&apos;s character name. &#xA0;Hyrkan smiled as he nodded his head.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;This guy attacked me with the intent to kill before, but I got him with the Watchman Style.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Watchman Style? </span></p><p><span style="">Everyone unconsciously dwelled upon that word. &#xA0;Several Users had puzzled expression on their faces. &#xA0;Hyrkan saw their expressions, so he answered after glancing at Sinclair.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;If you don&apos;t know what it is, you can ask Sinclair. &#xA0;No, he could be listening to this conversation in real life right now. &#xA0;The watch you gave me was contributed to a really good cause, Sinclair. &#xA0;Thank you. &#xA0;Ah. &#xA0;Also, I want to congratulate you for killing Sohank. &#xA0;You&apos;ll become so famous that it&apos;ll be hard for me to get your autograph. &#xA0;Aigo. &#xA0;I&apos;m jealous.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">As Hyrkan spoke, the Users that were quick on the uptake realized that Hyrkan wasn&apos;t just giving a simple explanation.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Well, let&apos;s get back to the main topic. &#xA0;Apollo. You said I&apos;ll regret messing with the Big Smiles. &#xA0;Didn&apos;t you say that? &#xA0;From my experience up to this point, I&apos;ve been pretty much unharmed after messing with the Big Smiles.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">It was a provocation.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;In truth, even if I did say I won&apos;t mess with the Big Smiles, the Big Smiles guild will still pursue me. &#xA0;I&apos;m about to pass by you, while licking my fingers after a meal. &#xA0;Are you really going to let me just walk away, Apollo? &#xA0;What if I summon twenty Skeletons to dance Beyonce&apos;s Single Lady in front of you? &#xA0;Will you just watch? &#xA0;Huh?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Son of a bitch&#x2026;&#x2026;.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">It was a clear provocation.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;It doesn&apos;t&apos; matter if I mess with Big Smiles or not. &#xA0;There won&apos;t be any significant changes to our relationship. &#xA0;I guess this answers the question you asked me before.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan was creating a situation where Apollo and the Big Smiles guild had to attack Hyrkan.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I&apos;ll immediately&#x2026;&#x2026;.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">It seemed Apollo was unable to hold back his anger. &#xA0;He was about to explode. &#xA0;However, the one to stop the explosion was Natal.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hahoe Mask. &#xA0;I&apos;m pretty sure our relationship with you isn&apos;t to bad. &#xA0;Am I deluding myself?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hydra guild has never messed with me.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Natal narrowed his eyes. Hyrkan gave an additional explanation.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;First, Sohank&apos;s loss was legitimate. &#xA0;Sohank can confirm this truth. &#xA0;I didn&apos;t cause his death.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&apos;However, you bastard set it up so that our guild would clash with the Big Smiles guild!&apos; &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2026;&#x2026;Natal didn&apos;t say those words. &#xA0;He didn&apos;t have proof. &#xA0;Circumstantial evidence wasn&apos;t proof in Warlord. &#xA0;Moreover, the Hydra guild was the one, who chose to battle the Big Smiles. &#xA0;They weren&apos;t pressured into making that decision.</span></p><p><span style="">Of course, Natal didn&apos;t plan on backing off so easily.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Is that all you have to say for yourself?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Natal once again tried to agitate Hyrkan. &#xA0;Natal gave off the impression that he didn&apos;t care about the lack of evidence. &#xA0;He appeared as if he was going to thoroughly punish Hyrkan.</span></p><p><span style="">Up to this point, Hyrkan had a playful atmosphere around him. &#xA0;However, the atmosphere around him changed drastically at Natal&apos;s forceful words.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;If you don&apos;t like my answer, then I&apos;m fine with it. &#xA0;I request a guild war.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">He had declared a guild war.</span></p><p><span style="">Everyone had a blank expression on their faces. &#xA0;This proposal was too unexpected.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Guild war?&#x2019; &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Does this mean the Hahoe Mask has a guild?&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">However, everyone came to their own answer to those questions.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Ah.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Oh my god&#x2026;&#x2026;.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">What would a guild battle with the Hahoe Mask mean?</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;The method of battle will be a group battle. &#xA0;The stage will be here. &#xA0;It will be on this frozen land. &#xA0;The losers will lose all claims to the Northland. &#xA0;The two guilds could attack me in order, or you guys can cooperate with each other. &#xA0;Either option is fine with me&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">The Hahoe Mask had just requested a guild war against the 30 great guilds by himself.</span></p><p><span style="">This was why Hyrkan didn&apos;t need to explain himself any further.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;We&apos;ll fight until one side is entirely eradicated.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Ssooook&#x2026;&#x2026;. </span></p><p><span style="">With those last words, the Skeleton Warriors that had been hiding in the snow started to reveal themselves one by one from behind Hyrkan.</span></p>
