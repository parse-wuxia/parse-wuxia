<p>Chapter 186 &#x2013; Barbarian King (3)</p><p>8.</p><p><span style="">[The 31st Barbarian Raid attempt has failed!] </span></p><p><span style="">[Barbarian King Event. &#xA0;Will things turn out fine?] </span></p><p><span style="">[The 31st Barbarian King Raid team gave a team briefing. &#xA0;&#x2018;We know the clear method. &#xA0;However, we couldn&#x2019;t execute it.&#x2019;] </span></p><p><span style="">When the Barbarian King appeared for the first time, the Users had welcomed it. &#xA0;They thought the existence of the Barbarian King would bring life into Warlord, which had started to become a bit boring. &#xA0;This view was shared by many.</span></p><p><span style="">Sixteen of the 30 great guilds had pulled out from the Barbarian King Event, and the Users had welcomed the news.</span></p><p><span style="">Recently, there had been historic events that had unfolded in Warlord. &#xA0;This included the Frozen Kingdom episode, Blaze Slime Dragon Raid and the Anugas Raid. &#xA0;However, most normal Users hadn&#x2019;t been able to enjoy these contents. &#xA0;They were playing the same game, yet it felt as if they were a world apart.</span></p><p><span style="">This was why the normal Users hadn&#x2019;t been worried when the 30 great guilds announced their non-participation. &#xA0;They didn&#x2019;t question the actions of the 30 great guilds. </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Finally, we get to enjoy something.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;This is a completely different scenario from the Immoral Prince raid. &#xA0;There are no restrictions. &#xA0;Everyone can participate in it!&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;This is different from the great battle. &#xA0;All Users can fight. &#xA0;This will be easy. &#xA0;The ones to benefit will be the people, who kill it first!&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">This was why everyone thought it was their chance to shine. &#xA0;They wanted to become the protagonists of this enormous event</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;If I catch the Barbarian King, I&#x2019;ll become the second coming of the Hahoe Mask!&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I&#x2019;ll guarantee it. &#xA0;The killing of the Barbarian King would bring in more money than winning a lottery ticket.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">The Hahoe Mask had gained money and fame through playing Warlord. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">This was a chance for someone to become the next Hahoe Mask.</span></p><p><span style="">This was what people thought, and they started acting accordingly.</span></p><p><span style="">Then they realized something.</span></p><p><span style="">They realized how foolish they had been. &#xA0;The Barbarian King ruthlessly crushed the expectations and hopes of the Users.</span></p><p><span style="">- Isn&#x2019;t the difficulty for the Barbarian King Raid too high?</span></p><p><span style="">- The average level of the monsters nearby are over Level 220&#x2026;. &#xA0;&#xA0;They number in the thousands. &#xA0;If we grade this as if it was a hunting ground, this might be considered to be a level 270 hunting ground.</span></p><p><span style="">The Barbarian King was powerful. &#xA0;It had several thousand monsters under its command, and they had an average level of 220.</span></p><p><span style="">- How about the method used during the great battle? &#xA0;What about the Eat the Tail method?</span></p><p><span style="">- &#x3134; It doesn&#x2019;t work.</span></p><p><span style="">The underlings of the Barbarian King was different from the Corrupted monsters from the great battle. &#xA0;They were smarter. &#xA0;They also possessed their original battle instincts, yet they were able to move in perfect order as a group.</span></p><p><span style="">- No, the problem isn&#x2019;t really about killing the miscellaneous monsters. &#xA0;We can take care of them through large scale magical bombardment. &#xA0;However, the problem is the Barbarian King! </span></p><p><span style="">- The 1st Phase isn&#x2019;t easy.</span></p><p><span style="">- &#x3134; Isn&#x2019;t it just destroying the Protection Gems? &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">- &#x3134; Two to three Strikers are killed when destroying just one Gem.</span></p><p><span style="">However, the biggest conundrum was the Barbarian King itself.</span></p><p><span style="">The Barbarian King was strong. &#xA0;While the Gems on its armor was active, magical and physical attacks had no effect.</span></p><p><span style="">Basically, the first button that had to be opened was to destroy the 31 Gems embedded on the Barbarian King&#x2019;s armor. &#xA0;The destruction of the Gem couldn&#x2019;t be done through magic. &#xA0;It had to be done through physical attacks.</span></p><p><span style="">Moreover, it couldn&#x2019;t be destroyed with one powerful blow. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">Twice!</span></p><p><span style="">It didn&#x2019;t matter how strong one&#x2019;s attack was. &#xA0;It took two powerful attacks to destroy a single Gem.</span></p><p><span style="">- The Barbarian King&#x2019;s battle capability is too high. &#xA0;Aggro management with this bastard is useless.</span></p><p><span style="">- &#x3134; This is the crux of the problem. &#xA0;The Barbarian King&#x2019;s difficulty level is out of our league.</span></p><p><span style="">- &#x3134; The skilled Strikers can&#x2019;t last against the Barbarian King.</span></p><p><span style="">When a User stuck close to the Barbarian King&#x2019;s body, it reacted immediately. &#xA0;If a User tried to stick to the body, it immediately reacted by stepping on the Users with its enormous feet. &#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;It also used its long arms to dislodge the Users.</span></p><p><span style="">When caught by the hands of the Barbarian King, the Users were crushed.</span></p><p><span style="">In the past 31 attempts at the Barbarian King Raid, no Users had survived being caught by the Barbarian King&#x2019;s hands! &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">- The destruction of the Protection Gem is at least doable. &#xA0;The problem is the 2nd Phase.</span></p><p><span style="">- The Storm Judgement Mode is messed up.</span></p><p><span style="">However, the worst and the most ridiculous part occurred when it entered into the 2nd Phase.</span></p><p><span style="">When all the Protection Gems were destroyed, the Barbarian King&#x2019;s golden armor lost its power. &#xA0;It was possible to stab the Barbarian King, and magical spells could harm it. &#xA0;However, at the same time, the Barbarian King carried out the Dragon&#x2019;s Judgement.</span></p><p><span style="">Dark clouds started to fill the sky, &#xA0;and a random User nearby was struck down by the Judgement. &#xA0;The Judgement was so powerful that a Tanker fully equipped with Lightning Resistant set suffered a Game Over by being hit once. &#xA0;Even if one was able to survive it, the Stun Effect would last for 10 minutes, so one would basically be a living corpse. &#xA0;No Skill could undo the Stun.</span></p><p><span style="">- Its healing ability is more messed up than the Storm Judgement Mode.</span></p><p><span style="">- &#x3134; This is the biggest problem. &#xA0;Who cares if magical and physical attack works? &#xA0;It just recovers from everything.</span></p><p><span style="">As the Users faced these tribulations, the Barbarian King displayed an almost unlimited healing ability. &#xA0;It was a monster amongst monsters. &#xA0;The idea of facing such a Boss monster was almost unimaginable.</span></p><p><span style="">At a certain point, the Users gave up.</span></p><p><span style="">Everyone now wanted someone else to catch the Barbarian King. &#xA0;They left it alone as they harbored such expectations.</span></p><p><span style="">However, the tyranny of the Barbarian King didn&#x2019;t end there.</span></p><p><span style="">[The monsters are moving with the Barbarian King?] </span></p><p><span style="">[Please investigate the regen rate by comparing the region before and after the Barbarian King appears.] </span></p><p><span style="">[It&#x2019;s confirmed. &#xA0;The regen rate of the monster decreases sharply after the Barbarian King passes by!] </span></p><p><span style="">The the Barbarian King passed by a region, and it pulled the nearby monsters. &#xA0;No monsters were left behind.</span></p><p><span style="">In some ways, this was the biggest blow to the Users.</span></p><p><span style="">When the Iron Lion Road was discovered, the Users no longer had to be stalled by the Voodook&#x2019;s Tunnel. &#xA0;They started crossing the Urugal mountain range using a wide road.</span></p><p><span style="">This was why a significant number of Users over level 200 had stepped onto the Black Continent. &#xA0;Naturally, there was a shortage of monsters. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">While this shortage was ongoing, the appearance of the Barbarian King dropped the regen rate.</span></p><p><span style="">To top it off, a half a dozen Users had to compete with each other for a single monster. &#xA0;It was a scene that reminded one of the early days of Warlord. &#xA0;The situation now repeated with Users over level 200. </span></p><p><span style="">To make things worse, the Five Stars and the 30 great guilds had already taken over the decent hunting grounds. &#xA0;They had taken advantage of their early arrival at the Black Continent.</span></p><p><span style="">Of course, they didn&#x2019;t allow the normal Users to hunt in their hunting grounds.</span></p><p><span style="">The normal Users couldn&apos;t even properly express their dissatisfaction. &#xA0;The normal Users weren&#x2019;t the Hahoe Mask.</span></p><p><span style="">- Shouldn&#x2019;t the 30 great guilds step forward? </span></p><p><span style="">- Didn&#x2019;t they announce their nonparticipation? </span></p><p><span style="">- &#x3134; Isn&#x2019;t this a dereliction of duty if they do nothing? </span></p><p><span style="">- &#x3134; Didn&#x2019;t the normal Users commend them for not participating?</span></p><p><span style="">- &#x3134; Still, this is too much! &#xA0;We can&#x2019;t even play the game! We can&#x2019;t even hunt! &#xA0;It has been 5 hours, since I&#x2019;ve logged on. &#xA0;I only caught nine monster!</span></p><p><span style="">- The hamsters of Tobot Soft&#x2026;. Please spread the monsters! </span></p><p><span style="">In the end, the key to the start and end of the event was being held by the 30 great guilds.</span></p><p><span style="">The normal Users wanted them to use this key to end the Barbarian King event. </span></p><p><span style="">However, the 30 guilds didn&#x2019;t move. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">Several guilds tried to move, but they were interfered by other guilds. </span></p><p><span style="">However, the silence by the Five Stars and the Stormhunters guild hurt the most, since they possessed the most influence on the Black Continent.</span></p><p><span style="">In the end, the Users gave up. &#xA0;A portion of the Users returned to the other side of the Urugal mountain range. &#xA0;The Black Continent was slowly reverting back to what it was before it was found.</span></p><p><span style="">- The Hahoe Mask wants to catch the Barbarian King?</span></p><p><span style="">In such turbulent times, a hero started to move.</span></p><p><span style="">The Hahoe Mask had kept his silence up until that point. &#xA0;He was north of the Red Desert. &#xA0;He had been catching the Tattoo Scorpions in the Red Wildland, but now a rumor started to gain traction.</span></p><p><span style="">- Even the Hahoe Mask wouldn&#x2019;t be able to catch the Barbarian King by himself.</span></p><p><span style="">- &#x3134; I agree.</span></p><p><span style="">- &#x3134; Even the Hahoe Mask can&#x2019;t do this.</span></p><p><span style="">The Users were pessimistic about the rumor. &#xA0;The Hahoe Mask was an extraordinary gamer, but the Barbarian King was too big to taken down by himself.</span></p><p><span style="">- That is why the Hahoe Mask is gathering Users to fight with him.</span></p><p><span style="">- &#xA0;He is gathering Users? </span></p><p><span style="">- &#x3134; From what I hear, he&#x2019;ll take a screenshot with everyone, who participates.</span></p><p><span style="">- &#x3134; Really? &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">- &#x3134; He will also give out Hahoe Masks made by him!</span></p><p><span style="">In such a situation, a new rumor gained steam.</span></p><p><span style="">Afterwards, Hahoe Mask spoke through a youtube video. &#xA0;He addressed the rumor.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I&#x2019;ll battle the Barbarian King. &#xA0;Please open a way for me. &#xA0;If you set up the stage and occupy the monsters, I&#x2019;ll defeat the Barbarian King. &#xA0;The stage will be at the Bizma Plains. &#xA0;I&#x2019;ll battle the Barbarian King there. &#xA0;Please I need all your help.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">It was no longer a rumor. &#xA0;Hahoe Mask started his recruitment pitch.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;It doesn&#x2019;t matter, who you are. &#xA0;Everyone is welcome to join. &#xA0;Moreover, I&#x2019;ll be handing out a Hahoe Mask to anyone who joins.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">The Event started for real.</span></p><p>9.</p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Please don&#x2019;t get too close to me. &#xA0;It&#x2019;ll look too friendly.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I&#x2019;m kidding. &#xA0;Please get closer to me.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">There was a long line. &#xA0;At the front of the line, a User wearing a shoddy Hahoe Mask was taking a picture with the Hahoe Mask. &#xA0;Every User in line either had a Hahoe Mask on their face or they were holding one in their hand.</span></p><p><span style="">While the Users were waiting, 50 Skeletons were dancing off to the side. &#xA0;The group of Skeletons were doing a dance from Michael Jackson&#x2019;s Thriller music video. &#xA0;They were dancing without music, and it caused the Users to burst out in laughter instead of clapping.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;The Skeletons are cute. &#xA0;I want to keep one as a pet.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;You want to make it your pet? &#xA0;I bet it is stronger than you.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;If the Hahoe Mask flicks his fingers twice, this place will turn into hell.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Then there was a large Bone Dragon, which was 20 meters in length, lying off to the side. &#xA0;Users climbed atop it to start taking pictures. &#xA0;Some even got on the back to make it look like they were riding the Dragon.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I&#x2019;m a Dragon Rider!&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hey. &#xA0;I want you to take a good picture of me!&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">In a different corner, a 10 meter tall Earth Golem was standing still. &#xA0;The Users were conducting a climbing competition.</span></p><p><span style="">It was an event set up for Strikers, who wanted to show off their climbing skill. &#xA0;In a flash, the Strikers climbed to the the head of Golem.</span></p><p><span style="">Some Users clapped their hands when they saw this.</span></p><p><span style="">On the other hand, no Users were climbing up the Iron Golem. &#xA0;The Iron Golem was too slick to climb. &#xA0;Instead, the Iron Golem was being used as a surface where the Users could graffitti on it.</span></p><p><span style="">This was the Hahoe Mask theme park!</span></p><p><span style="">Couple days ago, this place was where the Users fought desperately against the monsters. &#xA0;However, the Bizma Plain held a festive atmosphere right now.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Whatever.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">Of course, Hyrkan had to do all of this for free, so it was driving him nuts.</span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan gritted his teeth when he couldn&#x2019;t see the end of the line.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hahoe Mask-nim. &#xA0;Cheese! &#xA0;Cheese!&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">At Hyrkan&#x2019;s expression, the User demanded a smile for his screenshot.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Cheese.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan yelled out cheese.</span></p><p><span style="">The User seemed satisfied by the result, so the User distanced himself from the Hahoe Mask to check the screenshot. &#xA0;Then a new User sidled up next to Hyrkan.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Say cheese.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">The User immediately asked for him to say cheese, and Hyrkan couldn&#x2019;t turn down the request.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Yes, I&#x2019;ll laugh.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">Tomorrow these Users, who were demanding him to say cheese, would fight the Barbarian King&#x2019;s underlings with their lives on the line.</span></p><p><span style="">At that moment, Hyrkan thought about what happened couple days ago.</span></p><p><span style="">Whistling told Hyrkan of his plan to spread the rumor that the Hahoe Mask would be participating in the Barbarian King Raid.</span></p><p><span style="">First, the rumor was disseminated. &#xA0;When the rumor became ripe, Hahoe Mask used his youtube page to gather the Users. &#xA0;Afterwards, Hahoe Mask made a theme park at the Bizma Plain. &#xA0;This was where the battle would take place.</span></p><p><span style="">In truth, they hadn&#x2019;t planned on putting up the Hahoe Mask theme park. &#xA0;Hyrkan had planned on giving a speech to the gathered Users.</span></p><p><span style="">He would have said they were the only ones that could stop the Barbarian King. &#xA0;He would have warned them about the consequences that would result if they failed. &#xA0;The Black Continent would be turned into an inhospitable land. &#xA0;He had wanted to warn the Users about the dangers again.</span></p><p><span style="">He wanted to make an resistance army.</span></p><p><span style="">However, everyone had ignored his idea.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Who&#x2019;ll come if you do that?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I agree. &#xA0;No one wants to play the game under such a heavy cloud. &#xA0;We are playing to have fun.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Who would want to come if he did that?</span></p><p><span style="">Most Users just wanted to enjoy this game. &#xA0;They didn&#x2019;t want to play under such a heavy atmosphere. &#xA0;Not many people wanted to play as if they were under a gun.</span></p><p><span style="">This was why Users avoided such desperate struggles.</span></p><p><span style="">No one wanted to throw their bodies into a dangerous battle under such circumstances especially when it was almost a given that they&#x2019;ll suffer a 48 hour break.</span></p><p><span style="">On the other hand, the Users wouldn&#x2019;t mind giving up 48 hours if the task turned out to be interesting and fun. &#xA0;They would invest their time if it was a task they liked.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;How about we make a theme park? &#xA0;It&#x2019;ll be a theme park where Users will be able touch Hahoe Mask-nim&#x2019;s familiars!&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;That sounds great. &#xA0;What has gotten into you? &#xA0;How could you come up with this plan?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes. &#xA0;Of course, you would never be able to come up with such an idea.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What? Are you trying to pick a fight with me?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">This was how the plan for a Hahoe Mask theme park came into being. &#xA0;They had expected a strong resistance from the Hyrkan, but he was receptive to the idea. &#xA0;This surprised everyone. &#xA0;Whistling became the representative of the surprised group, and he asked the question in everyone&#x2019;s mind. </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Are you really fine with this?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">At the question, Hyrkan gave an answer.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;They are willing to die for me, so at the very least, I should do this for them. &#xA0;Moreover, Yojori is right. &#xA0;People play this game to have fun. &#xA0;If it isn&#x2019;t fun, who would want to play this game?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan recalled the answer he had given before.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Yes. &#xA0;They are here to die for me, so I should smile for them.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Cheese.&#x201D;</span></p><p>10.</p><p><span style="">From the beginning, Warlord&#x2019;s days were numbered. &#xA0;To be precise, an order was given to the M.I. by the Tobot Soft after the M.I. created Warlord.</span></p><p><span style="">It was told to create a Quest that could be carried out by the Users. &#xA0;Three Main Scenario Quests were made, and the game&#x2019;s setting could be changed as it progressed. &#xA0;Each Main Scenario Quest had to have contents that would last a year. &#xA0;&#xA0;The wanted a game they could produce and run for 3 years.</span></p><p><span style="">The command they had given was a test parameter.</span></p><p><span style="">It was a test to see if the M.I. could produce and run the game correctly.</span></p><p><span style="">Then Tobot Soft wanted to check how well their orders was being completed.</span></p><p><span style="">This was why they picked capable and competent testers to check out the Virtual Reality.</span></p><p><span style="">If thing went according to plan, this test would last for two years.</span></p><p><span style="">However, two variables occurred afterwards.</span></p><p><span style="">The first variable was the fact the Warlord&#x2019;s degree of completion was beyond imagination.</span></p><p><span style="">The second variable occurred when Tobot Soft ran into financial troubles. &#xA0;They were developing various project simultaneously using artificial intelligence. &#xA0;They were producing virtual reality content, yet they didn&#x2019;t have a business model to gain revenue. &#xA0;The investors started to hound them.</span></p><p><span style="">In the end, they had to make revenue any way they could. &#xA0;They had to satisfy the investors, so Warlord was immediately put into service. &#xA0;This immediately turned Tobot Soft in the new leader of the VR contents market.</span></p><p><span style="">At that time, Toby Gwynn had made calculations. &#xA0;He figured out how much money they would rake in from delaying the Main Scenario Quest by one year. &#xA0;Then he calculated the time he would need to come up with another content that would put them on the top again. &#xA0;At that moment, Tobi Gwynn gathered the original testers, and he offered them a new contract.</span></p><p><span style="">This was when the Hands guild was formed.</span></p><p><span style="">At first, the Hands guild directed events from the shadows. &#xA0;They slowed down the consumption of the game content. &#xA0;It wasn&#x2019;t too hard. &#xA0;The content called the Main Scenario quest was consumed the fastest by the 30 great guilds. &#xA0;So they just had to control the 30 great guilds.</span></p><p><span style="">However, a User had appeared one day, and he was better than the 30 great guilds. &#xA0;Moreover, it was impossible to bargain with or recruit this User. &#xA0;All the tactics used by the Hands guild didn&#x2019;t work on him. &#xA0;In the end, they had to send out a member named Horus as an agent. &#xA0;He was sent out to dominate the 30 great guilds, and he would forcefully change the flow of events in Warlord. &#xA0;Of course, this plan also failed.</span></p><p><span style="">However, the important point here was the fact that not all the members of the Hands guild were exposed to the sun.</span></p><p><span style="">They formed a powerful group within the shadows as preparation. &#xA0;These skilled Users would be able to do the dirty work, since the faces of these Users wasn&#x2019;t known. </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;It is finally our turn.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I never expected the Hahoe Mask to move.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;We&#x2019;ve waited for this day, and we even have the chance to become the victors of this game.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">They had been waiting for this day.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Let&#x2019;s go over our plan again. &#xA0;Our goal is to interfere with the Hahoe Mask, who is trying to hunt down the Barbarian King. &#xA0;When the Hahoe Mask suffers a Game Over, he has no choice, but to be summoned back to the Heard Fortress ruin town. &#xA0;Once he is revived there, the Five Stars will get in his way. &#xA0;We&#x2019;ll kill the Hahoe Mask every time he respawns.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">They would permanently erase the source of their troubles.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I want you guys to infiltrate the crowd that&#x2019;ll help him. &#xA0;We&#x2019;ll help the Hahoe Mask. &#xA0;However, when he enters the 2nd Phase after he successfully destroys the Gems&#x2026;.. &#xA0;We&#x2019;ll interrupt the Hahoe Mask at that moment. &#xA0;Any questions?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;None.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I have none.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;All right. &#xA0;It is time for our revenge. &#xA0;We have to make sure our stock options kick in.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">This desire caused them to move.</span></p>
