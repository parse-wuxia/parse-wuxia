<p>Chapter 168 &#x2013; King&#x2019;s Tomb (1)</p><p>1.</p><p><span style="">The news of the the Hydra guild acquiring the Fighters guild was spread in an instant. &#xA0;It also created a big ripple in Warlord.</span></p><p><span style="">- Why did the Hydra guild suddenly merge with the Fighters guild?</span></p><p><span style="">- &#x3134; They made the acquisition, because they needed the forces of the Fighters guild.</span></p><p><span style="">- Why does the Hydra guild suddenly need the Fighters guild&apos;s forces? &#xA0;What are they trying to do?</span></p><p><span style="">In the midst of the unrest, people started to figure out the reasons behind the merge. &#xA0;They deduced the reason why the Hydra guild had purchased the Fighters guild even at the expense of overpaying for the acquisition.</span></p><p><span style="">- They are basically signalling their intent on entering the Black Continent.</span></p><p><span style="">- &#x3134; The original Hydra guild had enough firepower to enter the Black Continent. &#xA0;So why make this move?</span></p><p><span style="">- &#x3134; Monsters aren&apos;t the only foes one has to face within the Black Continent.</span></p><p><span style="">In a short amount of time, a majority of the people came to a consensus in regards to the reasoning behind the merge.</span></p><p><span style="">- The Black Continent is already occupied by the Five Stars guild and the Stormhunters guild. &#xA0;They are basically saying that they won&apos;t back down.</span></p><p><span style="">- &#x3134; Will this be a start to a guild war? </span></p><p><span style="">- &#x3134; Didn&#x2019;t they already fight with the Big Smiles guild in the Frozen Lands? &#xA0;They&apos;ve already fought once, so there is no reason why they won&apos;t fight again.</span></p><p><span style="">- &#x3134; However, the Big Smiles is part of the Five Stars now. &#xA0;Will the Hydra guild really try to start something with the Big Smiles? </span></p><p><span style="">- &#x3134; This is why they acquired the Fighters guild! </span></p><p><span style="">- &#x3134; Still, would the acquisition of the Fighters guild be enough? &#xA0;In my opinion, it would have been better to create an alliance with another guild.</span></p><p><span style="">- &#x3134; The Hydra guild has a decent relationship with the Red Bulls. &#xA0;If they allied with each other on top of acquiring the Fighters guild... &#xA0;It might be possible. </span></p><p><span style="">Guild war.</span></p><p><span style="">This wasn&apos;t simply a fight between Users affiliated with a guild. &#xA0;It was a life-and-death fight where the guild&apos;s profit was put on the line as prize. &#xA0;Of course, when the Hydra guild enters the Black Continent, many predicted that it would signal the start of a guild war. &#xA0;It would be a battle between 30 great guilds that&apos;ll determine each guild&apos;s fate. &#xA0;Since the fate of a guild was on the line, it was predicted that it would be a battle amongst the most skilled Users, who represented the guilds. &#xA0;It would be like the fight between Sohank and Sinclair at the Frozen lands. &#xA0;The real pros would be fighting for their fame.</span></p><p><span style="">People expected it, and at the same time, they were looking forward to seeing it.</span></p><p><span style="">However, unlike the expectations held by the public, no full scale battles occurred.</span></p><p><span style="">When people realized that there wouldn&apos;t be any real clashes, everyone became disappointed. &#xA0;Ahn-jaehyun was one of the people, who was disappointed.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;There&apos;s no special news today either.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">Ahn-jaehyun busily tapped at his Tablet PC, and he had on a sullen expression on his face.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;In the end, did they decide to work with each other? &#xA0;From what I saw, the Hydra guild and the Five Stars overlapped in their area of operation... &#xA0;Did they come to some kind of agreement?&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">When the Hydra guild acquired the Fighters guild, Ahn-jaehyun had thought his opportunity had finally come.</span></p><p><span style="">From Ahn-jaehyun&apos;s perspective, it hadn&apos;t been great to share the Black Continent with the Five Stars and the Stormhunters guild.</span></p><p><span style="">On the other hand, if the field got messy, the story would change. &#xA0;As the competition amongst the 30 great guilds intensified, he would be able to operate more freely in the Black Continent.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;These bastards might attack me to screw me over... &#xA0;&#xA0;Something smells off.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">If the 30 great guilds worked with each other, it wouldn&apos;t have a positive effect on the Hahoe Mask. &#xA0;The Hahoe Mask wasn&apos;t some friendly and handsome oppa next door. &#xA0;If the 30 great guilds had the chance to eliminate the Hahoe Mask, they would gladly get rid of him immediately.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Still, it is great to see a great volume of Items being released.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">One of the positives of the 30 great guilds operating in the Black Continent was the fact the Black Continent was stabilizing as each faction kept each other in check. &#xA0;This had the effect of more Unique Items and Skill Books being put on the market.</span></p><p><span style="">Warlord had an Item Crafting system, and if one was lucky, one could produce a Unique Rank Item, while trying to make a normal Rank Item.</span></p><p><span style="">At the same time, the Black Continent had a lot of locations, where one could acquire Skill Books. &#xA0;There was the Dungeons called Ruins, and the Dungeon Rewards frequently gave No Name Skill Books as reward.</span></p><p><span style="">Level 190 No Name Skill Books were being put on the market intermittently. </span></p><p><span style="">Ahn-jaehyun tapped his Tablet PC to go into Warlord&apos;s auction house. &#xA0;There were 3 level 190 No Name Skill Book up for sale. &#xA0;The price was 1 million gold. &#xA0;All three of them were priced the same at 1 million gold.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Crazy bastards.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">Of course, the sellers weren&#x2019;t serious about selling it for gold. &#xA0;If they were really going to sell it for 1 million gold, one would be better off allowing the option of trading it for an Item of similar price instead of gold.</span></p><p><span style="">The sellers had put it up with a YOLO mentality. &#xA0;If it did sell, it would be a huge windfall for the seller. &#xA0;Even if it was a very slim possibility, there was a a bit of hope behind their actions.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;If it was a 100 thousand gold then maybe....&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">Warlord had a fair number of wealthy individuals, who had too much money.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;100,000 gold.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">Ahn-jaehyun clicked his tongue when he realized what he had just thought about.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;I&apos;m so far down this road. &#xA0;I&apos;m actually thinking about buying a Skill book for 100 thousand gold...&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">Ahn-jaehyun shook his head from side to side, and his gaze naturally landed on the V-Gear lying on top of the mattress. &#xA0;It was the most expensive V-Gear model a civilian could buy. &#xA0;He felt a weight press down on his chest.</span></p><p>2.</p><p><span style="">There were two mountains surrounded by a red forest. &#xA0;From afar, it looked as if the mountains were burning at its base. &#xA0;These mountains were so tall that it was hard to even look up at the peak of the mountains.</span></p><p><span style="">Red Forest.</span></p><p><span style="">It was one of the top 5 most difficult hunting ground found on the Black Continent.</span></p><p><span style="">One had to be level 240 to have access to the hunting ground!</span></p><p><span style="">The Stormhunters guild had found this place first, but they had given up any rights to it. &#xA0;It was still too difficult to claim this location as a hunting ground. &#xA0;It was a hellish location for the Users.</span></p><p><span style="">There was a fearsome monster that had made this place into hell.</span></p><p><span style="">Koo-uh-uh-uhng! </span></p><p><span style="">It was 3 meters tall, and it had human arms and legs like a werewolf. &#xA0;However, it possessed incredible offense, defense and combat ability that couldn&apos;t be compared to a humanoid monster.</span></p><p><span style="">The Werebear was first found by the Storm Princess Hahui, and the monster was famous for knocking her down with a single strike.</span></p><p><span style="">To be precise, Hahui thought the Werebear was cute, so she approached it to give it a hug. &#xA0;As she attempted the hug, she hadn&apos;t been able to dodge the Werebear&apos;s attack, and she was sent flying through the air. &#xA0;Hatch had recorded this scene, and he had uploaded it to his personal youtube page.</span></p><p><span style="">In just five days, the video received 30 million views. &#xA0;It was a very popular video.</span></p><p><span style="">Currently, the Werebear was letting out a rough cry.</span></p><p><span style="">Koo-uh-uh-uhng! </span></p><p><span style="">To be precise, it let out a scream.</span></p><p><span style="">Two Skeleton Knights easily turned away the arms swung by the Werebear, and the small Mini Ogre Skeleton Warriors continuously stabbed at the Werebear&apos;s legs. &#xA0;When the Werebear tried to catch the Mini Ogre Skeleton Warriors, the Skeleton Knights immediately brought down their swords to make wounds on its thick hide.</span></p><p><span style="">In such a situation, the cry let out by the Werebear could be interpreted as a scream.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ah. &#xA0;It is so noisy..&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan expressed his annoyance at hearing such a noise. &#xA0;The other Users would be startled by the sight in front of him, but it was something he saw everyday. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">Moreover, Hyrkan was busy pressing the Golden Conch to his ear.</span></p><p><span style="">- To the east&#xB7;&#xB7;&#xB7;&#xB7;&#xB7;&#xB7;. </span></p><p><span style="">The Golden Conch let out a low voice. &#xA0;The voice came out at really low volume. &#xA0;If one wasn&apos;t paying full attention to it, one wouldn&#x2019;t be able to make out the words. &#xA0;This was the reason why Hyrkan had become annoyed at the Werebear&apos;s cry.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Shit.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">Of course, this wasn&apos;t the real source of his annoyance.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;I have to go east again?&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">It was the 20th day.</span></p><p><span style="">It had been 20 days, since Hyrkan had received the Quest from the Heard Fortress Ruin town.</span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan had relied on the low voice of the Golden Conch for directions. &#xA0;It kept sending him towards the east, and he was once again sent towards the same direction.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;How far does it want me to go? &#xA0;Is it a bug?&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">Moreover, he hadn&apos;t traveled a short distance in the past 20 days. &#xA0;He had traveled a large distance. &#xA0;Despite this fact, he had nothing to show for it. &#xA0;He hadn&#x2019;t been able to find any more traces regarding the Archmage Bokan, and he hadn&#x2019;t found any Ruins either.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;This Bokan bastard is worse than Abrahim. &#xA0;What kind of a Quest has no end like this?&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">In truth, it was the worst part about this Quest.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hoo-ooh.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;After the Heard Fortress Ruin, I haven&apos;t been able to earn any more Ancient Powers.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">The fastest way to gain the Ancient Power was to find the Ruins. &#xA0;The other way was the Quest Rewards. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">Moreover, if one wanted to earn a Transcendent Rank Ancient Power, one needed Quests that took at least 10 days to complete them.</span></p><p><span style="">This was also the reason why he had thought he would at the very least find two Ruins during this Quest.</span></p><p><span style="">He had thought the appearance of Ruins was a given. &#xA0;In the Ruined Kingdom episode, the Ruins acted as the stepping stones to progress in one&#x2019;s Quest. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">This was the Quest to find the Archmage Bokan, so shouldn&apos;t this Quest have more extraordinary stepping stones?</span></p><p><span style="">However, for the past 20 days, Hyrkan had been busily fighting monsters.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;If the Quest Reward wasn&apos;t a Skill Book, I would have given up on this much earlier.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan shook his head from side to side as he once again looked at the battlefield. &#xA0;The Skeleton Knights and Skeleton Warriors made up a group of seven, and they were facing a Werebear. &#xA0;The monster was riddled with wounds.</span></p><p><span style="">However, it wasn&apos;t as if the Werebear was the only one to take wounds. &#xA0;The Skeleton Knights and Skeleton Warriors had taken significant damage at the Werebear&apos;s counterattacks. &#xA0;In fact, three Skeleton Warriors had already reverted themselves to Skeleton Fragments. &#xA0;The Werebear had been fighting 10 foes, and it had taken down three.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;I can understand why the Storm Princess was sent flying by this monster.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">The Werebears were really strong.</span></p><p><span style="">From Hyrkan&apos;s perspective, it was one of the strongest mid-sized normal monster he had encountered.</span></p><p><span style="">Moreover, the Werebears were absent from his memories.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Tsk!&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan clicked his tongue. &#xA0;At that moment, the Werebear suddenly looked at Hyrkan. &#xA0;When it met Hyrkan&apos;s eyes, the light within its eyes changed. &#xA0;It used to have a black gleam in its eyes, but now it had turned red.</span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan wasn&apos;t taken aback. &#xA0;This was the first time he had seen the monster do this, and when the monster stared at him with those eyes, Hyrkan knew something was up. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan was already running at that point.</span></p><p><span style="">The Werebear threw its body towards Hyrkan. &#xA0;The Skeleton Knights raised their shields in front of them to block it, but the Werebear was much stronger than before. &#xA0;The Skeleton Knights were thrown to the ground by the Body Slam. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">Koo-uh-uhng! </span></p><p><span style="">The Wearbear let out a roar, and it got onto all four feet for the first time. &#xA0;It started running after Hyrkan.</span></p><p><span style="">The Skeleton Knights rolled across the ground before they immediately righted themselves.</span></p><p><span style="">The Skeleton Knights looked at the Werebear&apos;s rear with a blue light in their eyes.</span></p><p><span style="">Dduhl-goo-ruhk, dduhl-goo-ruhk! </span></p><p><span style="">The Mini Ogre Skeleton Warriors were geniuses at tracking down foes, so they quickly followed right behind the Werebear. &#xA0;In a single breath, a single Mini Ogre Skeleton Warrior climbed atop the Werebear, and it started to stab down at the Werebear.</span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan, who had been running, suddenly changed direction, and he started to run in a circuitous route. &#xA0;After a brief moment, he came to a stop. &#xA0;When Hyrkan stopped running, the Werebear rushed towards Hyrkan.</span></p><p><span style="">Koo-uhng! </span></p><p><span style="">The Werebear was about to pounce on him when Hyrkan lowered his body. &#xA0;the Werebear flew over Hyrkan as if it was jumping over an obstacle. &#xA0;After landing on the floor, the Werebear quickly turned its body.</span></p><p><span style="">Chul-kuhk, chul-kuhk, chul-kuhk! </span></p><p><span style="">In a flash, the Skeleton Knights and Skeleton Warriors surrounded the Werebear. &#xA0;They maintained the perimeter as they charged towards the monster.</span></p><p><span style="">He had run away using the Whirlpool escape plan. &#xA0;He had run away in the shape of a whirlpool, and in the end, the bait would become surrounded.</span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan looked at the sight in a calm manner, and he once again put the Golden Conch to his ear.</span></p><p><span style="">- To the north....</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Uh?&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">At that moment, a new word appeared for the first time.</span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan turned his head towards the north.</span></p><p>3.</p><p><span style="">Hyrkan raised his head.</span></p><p><span style="">It was a large mountain, and everything about it was grand. &#xA0;Within this mountain, there was a cave that had a slightly different grandeur than a naturally made cave. &#xA0;On the exterior walls, there were realistic large knights carved into it, and it looked as if they would come to life at any moment. &#xA0;However, the sight that stole Hyrkan&apos;s gaze wasn&apos;t the knight sculptures.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;No way.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">There was a 10 meter tall cave entrance located between the large knight sculptures. &#xA0;On top of the cave entrance, the image of a crown was carved into it.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Can it be?&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">Moreover, there were gems embedded into the crown. &#xA0;The gems were massive. &#xA0;Each of the gems decorating the crown was easily bigger than a man&apos;s fist.</span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan looked at the cave entrance, and he put his treasured Golden Conch to his ear.</span></p><p><span style="">- Go in&#xB7;&#xB7;&#xB7;&#xB7;&#xB7;&#xB7;. </span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan followed the Golden Conch&apos;s words, and he entered the cave. &#xA0;Darkness greeted him.</span></p><p><span style="">There was no way anyone would smile happily when looking at this darkness. &#xA0;It was as if all the ills of the world was gathered within this darkness.</span></p><p><span style="">However, a smile formed on Hyrkan&apos;s lips as he looked at the darkness.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Thank you, my teacher&apos;s teacher.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan finally found his first stepping stone on the 20th day.</span></p>
