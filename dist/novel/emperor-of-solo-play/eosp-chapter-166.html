<p>Chapter 166 &#x2013; Trace of Bokan (2)</p><p>5.</p><p><span style="">[Quest &#x2018;Trace of Bokan&#x2019; has started.] </span></p><p><span style="">When he read the entirety of the letter sent by Ahimbree, Hyrkan heard the System Announcement in his ears. &#xA0;A new Quest was added to his Quest List. &#xA0;Hyrkan immediately checked the content of the Quest.</span></p><p><span style="">[Trace of Bokan] </span></p><p><span style="">- Quest Rank : Unique </span></p><p><span style="">- Quest Level Range : 200 </span></p><p><span style="">- Quest Content : The Archmage Bokan&apos;s trace has been discovered. &#xA0;Currently, the evidence is being kept by NPC Diung at the current Heard Fortress Ruin town. &#xA0;Please go find and investigate the trace of Bokan. </span></p><p><span style="">- Quest Reward : Skill Book. </span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Bokan....&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">The letter from Ahimbree was very long-winded.</span></p><p><span style="">Blah blah.</span></p><p><span style="">There were so many words that it almost made him feel annoyed.</span></p><p><span style="">However, the content behind the words were very simple.</span></p><p><span style="">Archmage Bokan was Ahimbree&apos;s teacher, and his trace was discovered in the Black Continent. &#xA0;Ahimbree wanted Hyrkan to find clues regarding Archmage Bokan on his behalf.</span></p><p><span style="">The reward was a Skill Book.</span></p><p><span style="">At this point in the game, obtaining a Skill Book containing a level 200 and above Skill was like a pipe dream. &#xA0;It was something one couldn&apos;t acquire even if one had money. &#xA0;Of course, his eyes spun from the implications. &#xA0;If it hadn&apos;t been for Bokan&apos;s name, he would have committed to this Quest as if his life was depended on it. </span></p><p><span style="">Basically, the name Bokan made him mull over his decision.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;&#xB7;&#xB7;&#xB7;&#xB7;&#xB7;&#xB7;what was his role again?&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">Archmage Bokan. </span></p><p><span style="">This NPC had seven disciples including Ahimbree. &#xA0;When one progressed in the Main Scenario Quest, one could hear his name mentioned occasionally.</span></p><p><span style="">If one put together all the information regarding Bokan, one could deduce that Bokan was someone, who had predicted the grave danger being faced by the world of Warlord right now. &#xA0;One could also surmise that he was someone, who had actively fought against this threat.</span></p><p><span style="">This theory was confirmed when his name appeared in the Immoral Prince storyline. </span></p><p><span style="">If one looked at the background lore, Archmage Bokan was the one, who had named the Immoral Prince. &#xA0;Bokan had hoped the prince would drive out the coming nightmares with the faithfuls, so Bokan had named him Dean.</span></p><p><span style="">An information of this level wasn&apos;t a secret. &#xA0;It basically put a big importance on Bokan&apos;s existence.</span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan was well aware of this fact.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Did Bokan ever appear in the Ruined Kingdom episode?&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">To his knowledge, Archmage Bokan had never appeared in the Ruined Kingdom episode.</span></p><p><span style="">Before he returned to the past, Hyrkan hadn&apos;t been able to influence how the Main Scenario Quest developed. &#xA0;He only had enough potential and power to carry out an already developed Main Scenario Quest. &#xA0;The trajectory of the Main Scenario Quest had been set, yet he had led the Hahoe Mask guild into attempting a fair amount of Main Scenario Quests.</span></p><p><span style="">This was also why he had been more attentive regarding the current Main Scenario Quest than the previous two Episodes. &#xA0;He had read all the Quest related guides. &#xA0;It was so well researched that these text were basically like dissertation papers. &#xA0;He memorized the important words, terminologies and english terms related to this episode. &#xA0;He also watched the Main Scenario Quest related videos broadcasted by the 30 great guilds. &#xA0;He had watched it as if was watching lectures over the internet.</span></p><p><span style="">However, there had been no mention of the Archmage Bokan within Hyrkan&apos;s memories. &#xA0;This character hadn&apos;t been present in the Ruined Kingdom episode.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;There were several Quests given by Ahimbree, which was linked to the Ruined Kingdom episode. &#xA0;Those Quests also gave Skill Books, but I don&apos;t remember a Quest that directly dealt with Bokan.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">Of course, the Quest Routes had already changed. &#xA0;Events that should have happened in the Ruined Kingdom episode occurred prior to the start of the episode. &#xA0;The Mythos Rank Ancient Powers and Anugas had already appeared.</span></p><p><span style="">Simply, the Quest timeline had been accelerated. &#xA0;The Rewards that should be appearing later in the game was coming out now.</span></p><p><span style="">The problem was the fact that Archmage Bokan hadn&apos;t appeared even at the end of the Ruined Kingdom episode. &#xA0;This meant that this content was from much further down in the story line.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;It can&apos;t be. &#xA0;Will the Dragons come out at this point in the game?&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan&apos;s expression hardened a little bit more as he stared at the Quest Window.</span></p><p>6.</p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Thank you very much.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;You were awesome.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes. &#xA0;Yes.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;It was my privilege to have met you!&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes. &#xA0;Yes. &#xA0;Yes.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">A party exited the Voodook&apos;s Tunnel exit, and there was a restless atmosphere around them.</span></p><p><span style="">At this point in the game, it was a given the Users would be coming out of the Voodook&apos;s Tunnel. &#xA0;It was a boring and common occurrence. &#xA0;This was why the Users resting nearby or the Users waiting for their party members barely paid attention to who came out of the tunnel. &#xA0;They would glance sideways at the exit, but that was the extent to their interest.</span></p><p><span style="">However, this party was different. &#xA0;There was an excited atmosphere being permeated by the group, and their restless nature drew the eyes of the surrounding Users.</span></p><p><span style="">The interested Users quickly saw the reason behind the hubbub.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hahoe Mask?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Is that the Hahoe Mask?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">It was the Hahoe Mask.</span></p><p><span style="">If one made a list ranking the Users, it wouldn&apos;t be an exaggeration to say the Hahoe Mask was the strongest and the best User in Warlord. </span></p><p><span style="">The party&apos;s atmosphere started to infect the atmosphere as the Users in the surrounding became excited.</span></p><p><span style="">When the Users, who travelled across the Voodook&apos;s Tunnel with Hyrkan, asked for a favor, he agreed to it.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Excuse me. &#xA0;Do you think I can take a screenshot with you?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I would like to ask you for one too.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;All right. &#xA0;Just don&apos;t put your hands on my shoulders.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I&apos;m playing with you. Shall I give you a kimchi or a cheese?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Please say cheese.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I hope you won&apos;t cuss me out or say I don&apos;t have any manners after uploading the picture.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I would never do that.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I heard your manners are excellent!&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">At Hyrkan&apos;s assent, the six Users squeezed in together, and each of them took a screenshot. &#xA0;In the process, Hyrkan rewarded them by making the peace sign.</span></p><p><span style="">Several Users thought it was ridiculous, but the others looked on with jealousy.</span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan had to cross the Urugal great mountain range as soon as possible, so he chose to become a third wheel. &#xA0;He inserted himself into a party that was getting ready to go into the Voodook&apos;s Tunnel.</span></p><p><span style="">It hadn&apos;t been hard. &#xA0;It would have been impossible if he had been some other User.</span></p><p><span style="">However, wasn&apos;t he THE Hahoe Mask?</span></p><p><span style="">The EXP the party would get would be the same, and they would gain a memory they would be able to look back on. &#xA0;Moreover, they were getting the sweet side of the deal, so no party would turn down an opportunity to add the Hahoe Mask to their party.</span></p><p><span style="">After his follow-up service, Hyrkan immediately headed towards the top of the Urugal mountain range.</span></p><p><span style="">There were a good number of Users on the road he was on, and when they discovered Hyrkan, an unsettled atmosphere developed. &#xA0;There looked to be enemies amongst the Users, but no one acted against him.</span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan was satisfied with the situation.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;This is no downside in being popular.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">There were people, who hated being famous. &#xA0;He wasn&#x2019;t like that. &#xA0;Hyrkan was the opposite. &#xA0;If he hated being popular, he wouldn&apos;t be playing this game for a living.</span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan liked being famous. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">He also enjoyed the benefit of being a popular public figure.</span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan had a refreshing smile on his face as he crossed the Urugal mountain range.</span></p><p><span style="">He once again came face to face with the Black Continent. &#xA0;When he saw the endless stretch of land, his smile was erased from his face.</span></p><p><span style="">While Hyrkan traveled to the Class Tower to earn his Skills, the situation on the Black Continent continued to move in a fluid manner.</span></p><p><span style="">This was especially true after the Heard Fortress town was formed. &#xA0;The Users were less cautious in their actions. &#xA0;The results created by Users, who were willing to put themselves at risk, was terrifying. &#xA0;It would give game developers nightmares.</span></p><p><span style="">At times, these kinds of Users were able to create unimaginable progress.</span></p><p><span style="">It was like that right now.</span></p><p><span style="">With the Urugal mountain as the starting point, the Users were expanding to the east, north and south.</span></p><p><span style="">The traces of the Ruined Kingdom was found, and the Users were combing through the Ruins. &#xA0;The secret behind the fall of the Ruined Kingdom was revealed, and the Users dreamed about becoming strong by finding the power left behind the Ruined Kingdom.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;The Stormhunters are going east.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">Amongst all of them, the ones with the most eye popping results was the Stormhunters guild.</span></p><p><span style="">East Rush! </span></p><p><span style="">The Stormhunters guild had gathered all their resources, and they were on an endless rush to the east.</span></p><p><span style="">He had characterized it as a rush, but in reality, the more apt description was a runaway train.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;I was right. &#xA0;Che-sulyun is a crazy bitch.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">Even amongst the Stormhunters guild, there was a hint of madness in Che-sulyun&apos;s exploits. &#xA0;Che-sulyun had perfected the use of the power of fire. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">Would she be able to continue using the nickname Storm Queen? &#xA0;It made people ponder over the subject.</span></p><p><span style="">Moreover, the Stormhunters guild were the most reckless with their lives amongst the Users in the Black Continent. &#xA0;Every live broadcast had two to three Users dying. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">They died, but at the same time, they achieved results that were well worth their lost lives. &#xA0;After finding the Balos ruins inside the Olbrid Forest, the Stormhunters guild had already found 2 additional Ruins. &#xA0;They were the first ones to find three Ruins. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">When one found a normal Ruin for the first time, one could gain around three to five Transcendent Ancient Power. &#xA0;At the very least, one Mythos Rank power should have appeared.</span></p><p><span style="">The Mythos rank Ancient Power was suddenly unleashed, because of Hyrkan. &#xA0;However, even the Legendary Rank Ancient Power was incredibly useful. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">Basically, if they were able to be the first ones to find the Ruins, they would be able rapidly increase the power of the entire guild. &#xA0;This was the most surefire way.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;The Five Star bastards are going north and south.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">The Five Stars weren&apos;t also playing around.</span></p><p><span style="">Their reputation had bottomed out when they got punched by the Hahoe Mask and the Stormhunters guild. &#xA0;However, they had the ability to recover from such damage. &#xA0;In the end, the fact that they were the biggest force within the Black Continent hadn&#x2019;t changed.</span></p><p><span style="">The Five star were using their forces to expand their territories to the north and south. &#xA0;Their moves were validated when they eventually found four ruins.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;The Poker teams are extraordinary.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">Of course, their activities centered around the Poker teams. &#xA0;The Poker teams were exposed as being very powerful when they faced down powerful monsters without much problem.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;No matter where I go I&apos;ll be treated like an uninvited guest.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">From now on, Hyrkan had to commit himself to a direction.</span></p><p><span style="">If he learned the evidence about Archmage Bokan at the Heard Fortress ruin, he&apos;ll probably be sent to one of three directions.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;All right.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">For a moment, Hyrkan&apos;s expression relaxed a little bit. &#xA0;He relaxed it by force. &#xA0;The ones that would weep would be the ones that would have to face him. &#xA0;He tried to make his thoughts into reality.</span></p><p>7.</p><p><span style="">When the Users saw the Hahoe Mask, they had two types of reaction.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Uh? &#xA0;It&apos;s the Hahoe Mask!&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">The first reaction was surprise.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Is it really the Hahoe Mask?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">The other reaction was suspicion.</span></p><p><span style="">However, this was the Heard Fortress. &#xA0;The Users, who reached the neutral zone inside the Black Continent, felt surprise more so than suspicion.</span></p><p><span style="">These Users had finished their 2nd Advancement. &#xA0;There was no reason why they would feel the need to pull pranks by wearing a Hahoe Mask in the Black Continent.</span></p><p><span style="">This was the reasoning behind their reactions.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Wow. &#xA0;The mood is quite serious.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Are they going to fight&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What reason do they have to fight?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Still, you never know. &#xA0;It isn&apos;t as if the Hahoe Mask has officially allied himself with the 30 great guilds.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">When Hyrkan appeared at the Heard Fortress Ruin town, the Users assumed he was the real deal.</span></p><p><span style="">This was why they were looking forward to the meeting in front of them.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;I never expected the Hydra guild to be here.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">Hydra guild members had surprised the Users by arriving at the Heard Fortress Ruin town. &#xA0;They had arrived a little bit earlier than the Hahoe Mask. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">The Users in the surrounding wanted to see what kind of chemical reaction would occur when the two sides met!</span></p><p><span style="">Of course, Hyrkan didn&apos;t really want to meet the Hydra guild. &#xA0;He had maintained a neutral relationship with the Hydra guild after the Immoral Prince episode, but it wasn&apos;t as if they had a cordial relationship. &#xA0;Moreover, Hyrkan considered the relationship to be closer to being bad after what happened at the Frozen land.</span></p><p><span style="">On the other hand, the Hydra guild had sought Hyrkan out.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;This is our first meeting since we met at the Frozen land.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">It was Sohank and Natal. &#xA0;The two of them had taken off their helmets, and they had approached the Hahoe Mask. &#xA0;There was only one additional User alongside these two. &#xA0;The rest of the Hydra guild members were out of sight.</span></p><p><span style="">It was a silent gesture, which indicated that they didn&apos;t want to fight with the Hahoe Mask.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What do you want with me?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan didn&apos;t show any signs of being happy at their appearance.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Huh?&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">His eyes narrowed behind the Hahoe Mask. &#xA0;It was the familiar faces of Natal and Sohank. Moreover, the User between them also looked familiar.</span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan eventually figured it out.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Kiyote?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Wow. &#xA0;You remembered me.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Kiyote reacted as if he had been waiting to hear those words. &#xA0;Kiyote stepped forward. &#xA0;He left behind Natal and Sohank to stand in front of Hyrkan.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes. &#xA0;I&apos;m Kiyote.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;You are affiliated with the Hydra guild now?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes. &#xA0;That isn&apos;t important. &#xA0;Do you remember that I still possess the right to challenge you once more?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Instead of answering him, Hyrkan smirked. &#xA0;Of course, he remembered it. &#xA0;At the time, he had received the really expensive Orc Hero&apos;s Sword from him.</span></p><p><span style="">That sword had been a great deal of help to him.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;So you want to use your challenge rights right now?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;No. &#xA0;There is an opponent I have to beat before I can fight you. &#xA0;Ah. &#xA0;I wanted to say I&apos;m making great use of the tactic I learned from you.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">As he spoke, Kiyote moved his arms. &#xA0;He made a gesture as if he was throwing something grasped in his hand.</span></p><p><span style="">Sand Toss.</span></p><p><span style="">Recently, he hadn&#x2019;t felt the need to use such tactics. &#xA0;In the past, it was a tactic he used to great effect in PKs and PVPs. </span></p><p><span style="">If one fell for such a trick, it usually became a stuff of nightmare. &#xA0;It was rare for someone to bite that very same move for one&apos;s own use.</span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan thought Kiyote was refreshing in many ways.</span></p><p><span style="">Sohank had a merry smile as he looked at Kiyote. &#xA0;Kiyote was acting as he liked. &#xA0;His courage and single mindedness was something that couldn&apos;t be learned over time by working on it.</span></p><p><span style="">On the other hand, Natal&apos;s face was distorted by anger. The Hahoe Mask had to be treated with special care. &#xA0;One had to be very careful when speaking to him, yet Kiyote talked about challenging him? &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">What nonsense.</span></p><p><span style="">It would be the end of them if the Hahoe Mask used the challenge as a pretext to declare a war on their guild.</span></p><p><span style="">In the end, Natal pulled at Kiyote&apos;s shoulder.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Mr. Kiyote. &#xA0;I want you to keep to the promise you made.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ah!&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Kiyote finally backed off.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I&apos;m sorry. &#xA0;I really never expected the Hahoe Mask to remember my name.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Originally, Kiyote hadn&#x2019;t been scheduled to come with them. &#xA0;It had been decided that only Natal and Sohank would go to speak with the Hahoe Mask. &#xA0;However, Kiyote had decided to butt in. &#xA0;Kiyote said that he had met the Hahoe Mask before, and he had an abnormal relationship with the Hahoe Mask. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">Kiyote had said that he suffered a loss to the Hahoe Mask, and he would be able to challenge the Hahoe Mask once.</span></p><p><span style="">This was why Natal had made Kiyote make a promise with him. &#xA0;If the Hahoe Mask didn&#x2019;t recognize him, he had to shut his mouth. &#xA0;Even if he was recognized, he was instructed to speak briefly. &#xA0;Natal had told him to keep the conversation to a short greeting.</span></p><p><span style="">Kiyote retreated, and Natal stood in front of the Hahoe Mask. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan spoke to Natal first.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I know we didn&apos;t have any direct confrontations on Frozen land. &#xA0;Still, if you harbor ill will towards me, shall we resolve our grievances right now?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Let us make a gentleman&apos;s agreement.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Natal spoke immediately after Hyrkan&apos;s words ended.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I have no plans on allying myself with you.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;We feel the same way. &#xA0;However, there is no reason why we should maul each other. &#xA0;That will only make our competitors happy.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Instead of answering, Hyrkan looked at Sohank. &#xA0;Sohank didn&apos;t look away from Hyrkan&apos;s gaze.</span></p><p><span style="">Come at me if you dare! </span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;It is as the rumor said. &#xA0;He must have earned the Ancient Power of Darkness.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">Sohank&apos;s confidence was not rooted in his Items or Level. &#xA0;He was also much inferior in terms of skills.</span></p><p><span style="">This meant he possessed some other power.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;The game is really pouring out all the Mythos Rank Ancient Power. &#xA0;Originally, it was a power given, so one could fight against the Dragon&apos;s army. &#xA0;However, every tom, dick and harry has it now...&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan made invidious remarks inside, and he quickly weighed the possibilities.</span></p><p><span style="">A gentleman&apos;s agreement was something he had wanted. &#xA0;Hyrkan also didn&apos;t want to make enemy of a User with a Mythos Rank Ancient Power.</span></p><p><span style="">However, he couldn&apos;t show any weakness here. &#xA0;If he did, he would be entering into a losing proposition.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;All right. &#xA0;We don&apos;t have to get into unnecessary dog fights. &#xA0;So which way are you going? &#xA0;Are you going north, east or south?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Natal steadily looked at Hyrkan when Natal heard his words.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;If our paths coincide, is he saying he&apos;ll ignore the gentleman&apos;s agreement? &#xA0;Is that what he is trying to say?&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">Natal considered Hyrkan&apos;s words to be a warning. &#xA0;It was a warning that said the Hyrdra guild would have to pay the cost if they really wanted this deal.</span></p><p><span style="">If one considered the Hydra guild&apos;s reputation, those terms were a nonstarter.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Which way are you going?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I&apos;ll know after I get my Quest. &#xA0;If you don&apos;t want to tell me, you don&apos;t have to.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Chul-kuhk! </span></p><p><span style="">He said it was fine with his words, but Hyrkan touched the sword sheathe on his waist. &#xA0;Of course, it was a threat. &#xA0;The threat implied that they&apos;ll hear the sound of his sword if they refused to give him an answer.</span></p><p><span style="">Normally, such tactics were Useless against the Hydra guild, but it was an entirely different story with the Hahoe Mask.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Shit. &#xA0;He is domineering. &#xA0;If I could do such feats by myself... &#xA0;I would also act like that.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">Natal became troubled.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;He is in a difficult spot. &#xA0;He cannot tell you our secrets.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Sohank, who hadn&apos;t spoke until now, &#xA0;resolved Natal&#x2019;s dilemma.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Please be understanding. &#xA0;You should consider what the Hydra guild specializes in. &#xA0;We have no choice.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;If you don&apos;t want to tell me, then you don&apos;t have to. &#xA0;Someone might think I had threatened you judging by your words.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">When Sohank stepped forward, the Hahoe Mask shrugged his shoulders, and he turned his back towards them. &#xA0;There was no reason to continue this conversation.</span></p><p><span style="">When the Hahoe Mask left, Natal spoke to Sohank.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Thanks to you I was able to gain some breathing room.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;That is my role. &#xA0;Anyways, we were able to confirm something. &#xA0;The Hahoe Mask has no allies in the Black Continent.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Natal nodded his head.</span></p><p><span style="">There were two reasons why they had sought out the Hahoe Mask. The first reason was straightforward. &#xA0;They wanted a gentleman&apos;s agreement where they&apos;ll be able to avoid unnecessary fights. &#xA0;The other reason was to assess Hahoe Mask&apos;s current condition.</span></p><p><span style="">There was a hidden benefactor behind the Hahoe Mask. &#xA0;If the Hahoe Mask&apos;s benefactor had the means to actively help the Hahoe Mask through troops, the Hahoe Mask wouldn&apos;t have backed off right now.</span></p><p><span style="">However, in the recent days, he had been helped by the Stormhunters guild when facing the Five Stars. &#xA0;If one looked at his recent activities, it seemed he wanted to solve his own problems instead of waiting for some other power to come in and help him.</span></p><p><span style="">Of course, the brief conversation today didn&apos;t make them 100 percent confident in their theory. &#xA0;However, one needed a suspicion before one could come up with a hypothesis. &#xA0;Afterwards, evidence had to be gathered to prove the hypothesis. &#xA0;Then one would be able to prove that the suspicion was right.</span></p><p><span style="">After hearing the conversation between the two, Kiyote spoke up.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What will happen if I challenge and win against the Hahoe Mask? &#xA0;What would be my rank? Will I be able to become the 10th Head?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Sohank and Natal had been having a serious conversation, but the cat got their tongue when they heard Kiyote&apos;s words.</span></p>
