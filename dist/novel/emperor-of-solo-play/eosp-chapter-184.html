<p>Chapter 184 &#x2013; Barbarian King (1)</p><p>1.</p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Uh?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;What the hell is that?&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">The very first User to see the sign was a User named Able.</span></p><p><span style="">He had just reached level 200. &#xA0;&#xA0;After finishing his 2nd Advancement, he wanted to celebrate by heading across the Urugal mountain range to reach the Black Continent. &#xA0;However, the Voodook&#x2019;s Tunnel had a long line of Users in front of it. &#xA0;He clicked his tongue as he took in the sight, and he eventually descended the Urugal mountain range.</span></p><p><span style="">When he was doing so, he saw a group piercing through the thick fog to head towards the top of the Urugal mountain range.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;What is that?&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">It was a very weird looking group. &#xA0;They were all wearing crudely designed helmets that looked similar to a lion&#x2019;s mane.</span></p><p><span style="">In truth, Warlord allowed Users to customize their equipment. &#xA0;The Users could create ridiculous designs for armors if they were satisfied with the result. &#xA0;The game allowed Users to craft and wear almost any design.</span></p><p><span style="">However, these beings were riding large lions, and such Users assuredly didn&#x2019;t exist in Warlord. &#xA0;Moreover, there were more than one of them. &#xA0;The fact that there were 30 of them pretty much confirmed that they weren&#x2019;t a group of Users.</span></p><p><span style="">When Able&#x2019;s thought process reached this conclusion, his expression changed.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Did I just stumble upon a jackpot?&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">Able started recording the sight. &#xA0;He chased after the knights climbing up the Urugal mountain range using the lions as mounts.</span></p><p><span style="">However, they were too fast. &#xA0;The lions were running up steep inclines as if they were running across a flatland.</span></p><p><span style="">Able was confident in his skills to climb a mountain, but the very idea that he would be able to catch up to them was absurd.</span></p><p><span style="">In the end, Able lost sight of them. &#xA0;He came to a stop.</span></p><p><span style="">Shit!</span></p><p><span style="">A bitter sound came out his mouth.</span></p><p><span style="">However, at that moment, Able realized something.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Huh?&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">He had crossed the Urugal mountain using a different road. &#xA0;He hadn&#x2019;t used the Voodook&#x2019;s Tunnel.</span></p><p><span style="">He had just found a new road leading into the Black Continent. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">At that moment, Able had found the Iron Lion Road, and it was the start of a new event.</span></p><p>2.</p><p><span style="">&#x201C;This is crazy.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Ahn-jaehyun put the grape candy into the capsule coffee in an annoyed manner. &#xA0;Ahn-jaehyun was reading the torrent of information and breaking news coming out in regards to Warlord. &#xA0;He had a very annoyed expression on his face.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;What kind of a game doesn&#x2019;t allow the Users to catch their breaths like this?&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">He finally brought the coffee to his mouth, and his glasses fogged up. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">Ahn-jaehyun kept drinking the coffee, and he looked at the Tablet PC&#x2019;s screen when the fog cleared.</span></p><p><span style="">[Barbarian King Event has started!] </span></p><p><span style="">[The Stormhunter guild will prove once again that they are the best guild!] </span></p><p><span style="">[Iron Lion Road! &#xA0;Everyone is heading towards the Black Continent!] </span></p><p><span style="">The Stormhunters guild had triggered the Barbarian King Event.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Anyways, a middle boss has made its appearance.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">He had heard about the Barbarian King through the Blacksmith Olf.</span></p><p><span style="">This information matched up with the prior knowledge he had. &#xA0;Of course, Ahn-jaehyun was well aware of the worth represented by the Barbarian King in the Main Scenario Quest.</span></p><p><span style="">It was similar to the Great Battle in the Immoral Prince episode. &#xA0;The Immoral Prince episode had led to the Argardo Raid. &#xA0;It was a similar concept. &#xA0;After killing the Barbarian King, it would lead to the acquisition Quest for the War King&#x2019;s relics. &#xA0;Then one would have to fight the five Powers of the Dragon. &#xA0;Afterwards, the only thing left was the final battle.</span></p><p><span style="">However, Ahn-jaehyun wasn&#x2019;t worried about that.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;The Stormhunters are faster than me.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">Currently, Ahn-jaehyun had received two things from the Blacksmith Olf.</span></p><p><span style="">The Gold Bar he had acquired was melted by the Blacksmith Olf, and it created a hybrid Item. &#xA0;It was a cross between a Golden Conch and a Dragon&#x2019;s Horn. &#xA0;It was the Dragon Horn Conch.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;I&#x2019;m not doing so well with the Golden Conch Quests right now&#x2026;.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">He had two threads of evidence he could follow, but he wasn&#x2019;t able to fully take advantage of them. </span></p><p><span style="">The problem was the level restriction.</span></p><p><span style="">One needed to be level 250 to be able to progress in the War King&#x2019;s Artifact Quest.</span></p><p><span style="">In the case of the Dragon Horn Conch, it was impossible to progress in the Quest right now.</span></p><p><span style="">This was the reason why the Hahoe Mask was burning money as he continued to hunt.</span></p><p><span style="">While he was still hunting, the Stormhunters guild had triggered the Barbarian King Event. &#xA0;It basically meant that they were couple steps in front of the Hahoe Mask.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Those monsters...&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">The surprising part was that they deserved to be called monsters. &#xA0;Ahn-jaehyun had no choice, but to acknowledge this fact.</span></p><p><span style="">The Stormhunters guild was putting their guild&#x2019;s full capacity and ability to breaking through to the east. &#xA0;In the process, they had suffered considerably. &#xA0;Their progress had to be kept secret, so they couldn&#x2019;t broadcast their achievements. &#xA0;Moreover, the skilled Users, who represented the guild, were all devoted to progressing in the Main Scenario Quest. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">The biggest money earner on a live channel were the Raid footages. &#xA0;This meant their profit took a deep dive.</span></p><p><span style="">In truth, after the Stormhunters arrived at the Black Continent, the Stormhunters guild&#x2019;s live chanel was the least profitable channel amongst the 30 great guilds.</span></p><p><span style="">A guild with such clout had decided to invest in the Main Scenario Quest, and the result matched their efforts. </span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Yes, it was like this during that time. &#xA0;They were always monsters. &#xA0;Che-sulyun was the monster queen.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">He still detested the Stormhunters guild. &#xA0;His hate had eroded away significantly compared to the time when Kim-dongsoo betrayed him with the Stormhunters guild. &#xA0;Still, he didn&#x2019;t like the Stormhunters guild. </span></p><p><span style="">This didn&#x2019;t mean Ahn-jaehyun would disparage the skill level of the Stormhunters guild. If he wanted to crush them, he had to be cold in how he assessed them. &#xA0;He had to be cold. &#xA0;He had to leave behind his personal feelings and private affairs. &#xA0;When he looked at the Stormhunters with an objective eye, they were an awesome guild.</span></p><p><span style="">They were playing this game properly.</span></p><p><span style="">While the other guilds were focusing on personal gains, profits and popularity, they were focused on the game itself.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;This damned ill-fated relationship. &#xA0;Damn it to hell.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">Ahn-jaehyun sipped his coffee. &#xA0;As he sipped his coffee, he spoke towards his own pride.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;You are an expensive bastard.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">Ahn-jaehyun complained about it.</span></p><p><span style="">He complained about it, but he didn&#x2019;t regret his actions.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Which position shall I take? &#xA0;What&#x2019;s my best option?&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">Ahn-jaehyun continued to coldly assess the situation.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Since the Barbarian King has made its appearance, the Black Continent will become a mess.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">Since the Barbarian King Event had already been triggered, the Barbarian King would start to run amok across the Black Continent.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;This is an impossible task.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">Obviously, the regular Users and the Underfoot guilds wouldn&#x2019;t be able to take down the Barbarian King. &#xA0;In the first place, the game&#x2019;s pace was overclocked. &#xA0;There was no way the normal Users would be able to follow the pace of the high rank Users. &#xA0;How would they be able to face a monster that would &#xA0;be troublesome for these high rank Users?</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;The problem isn&#x2019;t when they&#x2019;ll beat it. &#xA0;There is a good chance that they&#x2019;ll get pushed back.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">If the 30 great guilds as a whole didn&#x2019;t control this event, the Black Continent will be lost.</span></p><p><span style="">In reality, there was only a single checkpoint inside the Black Continent. &#xA0;It was the Heard Fortress ruin town.</span></p><p><span style="">What would happen if the Heard Fortress ruin town was overrun? &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">The Iron Lion Road was discovered, but it&#x2019;ll become very troublesome to cross the Urugal mountain range after every death.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;From the Main Scenario Quest Info, this Barbarian King has the Power of Storm at its disposal.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">The Power of Storm was an additional feature.</span></p><p><span style="">From Ahn-jaehyun&#x2019;s memories, the Barbarian King had been a terrifying monster even without the Power of Storm. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">What would happen if this monster was now capable of using the Power of Storm?</span></p><p><span style="">In truth, Ahn-jaehyun couldn&#x2019;t even imagine a clear method that could be used against the Barbarian King. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">If he couldn&#x2019;t imagine it, how could any other User in Warlord come up with one?</span></p><p><span style="">There was no way they&#x2019;ll be able to come up with one.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Is this the season 2 of the Great Battle?&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">In the end, the ones holding the key was the 30 great guild.</span></p><p><span style="">It was akin to the time during the great battle. &#xA0;They held the fate of the Black Continent, and there was a chance that the Black Continent could revert back to its previous state. &#xA0;The level 220 and up hunting grounds were all located within the Black Continent. &#xA0;If the Black Continent became a region inaccessible by Users, the Level Up pace would drop significantly.</span></p><p><span style="">Of course, Hahoe Mask would be able to hunt there. &#xA0;It would be more arduous, but it was possible for him.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Hmmm.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">This was why his course of action was clear this time around.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;The answer is to not even attempt this. </span></p><p><span style="">He&#x2019;ll sit this one out.</span></p><p><span style="">First, the 30 great guilds held the key to this event. &#xA0;If the Hahoe Mask participated in the event, the Big Smiles guild and others wouldn&#x2019;t look kindly at his actions. &#xA0;Their eyes would focus on him. &#xA0;They&#x2019;ll make a big fuss about catching the Hahoe Mask.</span></p><p><span style="">Moreover, even if the Barbarian King took down the entirety of the Black Continent, the Hahoe Mask could still hunt in any location he wanted.</span></p><p><span style="">He was an independent. &#xA0;Hahoe Mask could travel anywhere, and he could solo anything. &#xA0;&#xA0;He had matured as a Necromancer, and it gave him the power to solo. &#xA0;He was an All-Strength Necromancer. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">If the Black Continent turned into being the true Black Continent, Hahoe Mask&#x2019;s competitors would be weeded out through natural selection. &#xA0;This would be the best case scenario for him.</span></p><p><span style="">Moreover, the cream of the Barbarian King Event was the Barbarian King. &#xA0;He could just show up when the Barbarian King Raid started. &#xA0;He could just show up to eat the kernel by bypassing the outer shell.</span></p><p><span style="">The most logical choice he could make was to not attend this event. &#xA0;He could weigh the advantages and disadvantages several hundred to several thousand times. &#xA0;However, this course of action always came out as being the most profitable. &#xA0;It wasn&#x2019;t close.</span></p><p><span style="">There was only one factor that interfered with him taking the wise choice.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;I have to take a backseat in such a large event&#x2026;. &#xA0;This doesn&#x2019;t feel too great.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">He didn&#x2019;t like the choice he would have to make.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;If the Hahoe Mask did something the 30 great guilds couldn&#x2019;t do&#x2026; &#xA0;It would make for a killer narrative. </span></p><p><span style="">As he had these thoughts, Ahn-jaehyun drank his coffee. &#xA0;He once again spoke towards his pride.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;You are a really expensive bastard.&#x2019;</span></p><p>3.</p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Please call me Horus.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;You can call me Hatch.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Horus and Hatch.</span></p><p><span style="">They only knew each other by name. &#xA0;They both raised their hand, and they naturally shook each other&#x2019;s hand. &#xA0;They pumped their hands twice, but after the handshake ended, they continued to clasp hands.</span></p><p><span style="">Hatch had relaxed his hand, but Horus continued to grip Hatch&#x2019;s hand tightly.</span></p><p><span style="">Hatch patiently looked at Horus. &#xA0;Horus smiled as he spoke to Hatch.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I&#x2019;m speaking to you assuming that you already know what&#x2019;s going on. &#xA0;Of course, our conversation today is off the record.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;If I planned to publicize this, it would have already been done. &#xA0;If I had any plans of running my mouth, I wouldn&#x2019;t have shown up here.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Thank you.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Horus finally let go of Hatch&#x2019;s hand. &#xA0;Hatch lightly moved his hand, which had participated in the handshake. &#xA0;He checked if his hand was damaged.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I&#x2019;ve heard about you. &#xA0;You are someone like a father to Warlord.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">The words were just put out there, and Hatch answered in a calm manner.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;If that is true, there are about 100 fathers and 100 mothers. &#xA0;I don&#x2019;t think it is prudent to call me the father. &#xA0;I only designed what is considered to be akin to the pinky nail of Warlord.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Then you know the worth of Warlord. &#xA0;Of course, you know about it.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;When the Main Scenario Quest lifespan is extended by a year, Tobi Gwynn&#x2019;s personal wealth increases by 16%. &#xA0;I&#x2019;m well aware of the fact that Tobot Soft&#x2019;s stock also increases by 23%.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Hatch finally lost interest in inspecting his hand. &#xA0;He looked at Horus.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I know the next project needs about 2 years to complete. &#xA0;I know you guys have a contract with the Tobot Soft, and the contract will give you stock options. &#xA0;However, there was a condition that had to be fulfilled before you can exercise your stock option.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Horus nodded his head instead of answering Hatch. &#xA0;It was hard to tell if he was agreeing or disagreeing with Hatch. &#xA0;It was hard to decipher the meaning behind the gesture.</span></p><p><span style="">Horus stopped nodding his head, and he changed the topic of the conversation.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;It seems you know about everything. &#xA0;All right. Let&#x2019;s talk. &#xA0;We want to extend the shelf life of this game.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Wouldn&#x2019;t the shelf life of Warlord be fine as long as Tobot Soft doesn&#x2019;t pull its service? &#xA0;When the Main Scenario Quest ends, it&#x2019;ll turn into normal mode. &#xA0;From that point, the game developers can work on the game. &#xA0;Wouldn&#x2019;t that be preferable? &#xA0;They could set up events that they couldn&#x2019;t set up before.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Do you really think that is true?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I guess if such a thing happens, there are other new games with great reviews that one could try. &#xA0;There is a recently released game called Play the World&#x2026;. &#xA0;I looked at it once, and I thought it was pretty well made.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;That game has a bad naming sense.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;This game is named Warlord, so a name like that could be forgiven. &#xA0;Moreover, that game doesn&#x2019;t have monsters like the Hahoe Mask playing it.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Horus shut his mouth at the talk of the Hahoe Mask. &#xA0;One could see his brows slightly furrow.</span></p><p><span style="">Unlike before, Hatch could read his emotions through his expression.</span></p><p><span style="">That damned Hahoe Mask bastard! </span></p><p><span style="">Hatch understood what Horus&#x2019; expression was saying. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">If it wasn&#x2019;t for the Hahoe Mask, Horus wouldn&#x2019;t have to be a tool for the Tobot Soft. &#xA0;He wouldn&#x2019;t have to do perform such ridiculous tasks. &#xA0;He would have been able to live out his life in comfort. &#xA0;He would have had so much money that he wouldn&#x2019;t have been able to spend it in his lifetime.</span></p><p><span style="">On top of that, Tobo Soft&#x2019;s next project would have received the popularity of Warlord. &#xA0;The next project would have achieved a bigger success than Warlord. &#xA0;For helping out Tobot Soft, the Hands guild members would have also received complete support in their next game. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">However, all of this fell into pieces when a single User named the Hahoe Mask appeared out of nowhere.</span></p><p><span style="">If Hatch was in Horus&#x2019; shoes, he would have use every method and tricks to eliminate the Hahoe Mask.</span></p><p><span style="">This was also one of the reason why Horus had come out to meet Hatch. &#xA0;Currently, Horus and Tobo Soft decided to use every methods and tricks available to them. </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I&#x2019;m sure it&#x2019;s frustrating. &#xA0;If you could intervene in the game, you could immediately limit his effectiveness. &#xA0;However, you can only intervene if the Main Scenario Quest is done&#x2026;. &#xA0;&#xA0;However, who could have have predicted this? &#xA0;This was a game made to test the performance of the M.I. &#xA0;When the game gained investors, they pushed for the game to be released. &#xA0;This was why it was packaged roughly before it was put out as a product. &#xA0;No one expected this level of success.</span></p><p><span style="">Thanks to this success, Tobo Soft&#x2019;s market value rose to almost rival to Peach company. &#xA0;Of course, this was possible because of a stock bubble.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Let us form a common front. &#xA0;In this Barbarian King Event, let us leave the Barbarian King alone to run amok across the Black Continent. &#xA0;It will be a similar situation as the great battle. &#xA0;The 30 great guilds will announce our plan to not participate in this event. &#xA0;I&#x2019;m sure your side wouldn&#x2019;t gain much if Warlord ended too quickly. &#xA0;I heard you aren&#x2019;t making much profit through the live channel.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;You want the 30 great guilds to collude with each other?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Let me be clear about this. &#xA0;If you don&#x2019;t form a common front with us, you&#x2019;ll have to be prepared for a guild war. &#xA0;A significant amount of money is flowing within this game. &#xA0;Warlord isn&#x2019;t a simple game. &#xA0;The people are enjoying Warlord, because it is an unknown world being created by the A.I. &#xA0;When the unknown world turns into a man-made content, the appeal for this game would disappear.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">At Horus&#x2019; words, Hatch&#x2019;s mouth twitched. &#xA0;It seemed he wanted to express an emotion, yet he was holding himself back.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What about the Hahoe Mask?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;If we can&#x2019;t control him, then we&#x2019;ll have to crush him. &#xA0;It would be great if someone from the 30 great guild took control of the Hahoe Mask. &#xA0;If he participates in the Barbarian King Event, we&#x2019;ll send out a special force to thwart him. &#xA0;We&#x2019;ll keep killing him until he quits this game. &#xA0;Unless Hahoe Mask is an idiot, he won&#x2019;t try to get in our way.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Hatch raised his hand. &#xA0;Horus closed his mouth when he saw the raised hand.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;All right. &#xA0;Let&#x2019;s work together.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Horus smiled as he nodded his head.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;You made the wise choice. Also, I heard you guys are working with the Red Bulls guild. &#xA0;Is it true?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;It is a strategic alliance.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;So the Red Bulls will have the same views as the Stormhunters.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Hatch gave a bright smile, and he laughed with his eyes. &#xA0;He hadn&#x2019;t given an answer, but his expression gave a clear answer.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Anyways, our meeting and the matters we discussed never happened. &#xA0;This is off the record. &#xA0;Since we&#x2019;ve made an agreement, let us not keep any records.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">At Hatch&#x2019;s words, Horus quickly replied.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Of course.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Let us use a classic method to contact each other. &#xA0;Any message should be passed between Users. &#xA0;Since our goal is not to achieve a goal, so I guess our goal is to do nothing.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">After finishing his words, Hatch pushed his hand forward.</span></p><p><span style="">Horus once again grasped his hand.</span></p><p><span style="">After several hours had passed, breaking news started to pop up.</span></p><p><span style="">[Sixteen guilds have announced their non-participation in the Barbarian King event. &#xA0;They&#x2019;ll leave the event for the normal Users!] </span></p><p><span style="">[The Non-participation announcement includes the Five Star and the Big Three. &#xA0;This will start a trend within the 30 great guilds.] </span></p><p><span style="">[Barbarian King event. &#xA0;Who will become the second Hahoe Mask?]</span></p>
