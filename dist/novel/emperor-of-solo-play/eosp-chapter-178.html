<p>Chapter 178 &#x2013; Hero Slaughterer (1)</p><p><span style="">1.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Will you guys really be ok here?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">They were at the entrance of the Highwood Forest. &#xA0;For the past 5 days, they had a pleasant hunt in the Red Desert and the Highwood Forest. &#xA0;They had been walking in the same direction for a long time. &#xA0;Now Hyrkan and Whistling&#x2019;s party was facing each other. &#xA0;&#xA0;When they came to a stop, there was only one reason why they would face each other.</span></p><p><span style="">It was time for them to part.</span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan directed his question towards the three, and they immediately gave their answer.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;We aren&#x2019;t children. &#xA0;If it is just the three of us, it&#x2019;ll be hard to overcome these monsters, but it won&#x2019;t be a problem if we run away. &#xA0;We can go by ourselves from this point. &#xA0;Also, this has been a lot of fun.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;You should go take care of your own business. &#xA0;We have to part ways here anyways. &#xA0;If you want to cross the Urugual mountain range, you&#x2019;ll have to head west. &#xA0;We have to head east. &#xA0;Also, this has been a lot of fun.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Yojori and Joba didn&#x2019;t speak one after another. &#xA0;They spoke at the same time. &#xA0;Their words overlapped, and they even spoke the last sentence at the same time. &#xA0;Their two voices weirdly complemented each other.</span></p><p><span style="">It was similar to how they overlapped their words. &#xA0;They glared at each other at the same time. &#xA0;It seemed even their thought patterns were similar.</span></p><p><span style="">Each thought the other was intruding on their words, and it made them annoyed.</span></p><p><span style="">During all of this, Whistling and Hyrkan spoke to each other.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Thank you.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;No, I&#x2019;m more thankful. &#xA0;If it wasn&#x2019;t for you, I would have been floundering to find a clue.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;The Sand Snake Ice Cream tasted pretty good.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Yeah. &#xA0;It had a butter vanilla ice cream taste. &#xA0;This game is overflowing with such delicious food, but I have no idea why all the expensive recovery Items were made to taste so bad.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;You expend a lot to play this game.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;It is driving me nuts. &#xA0;It is too expensive. &#xA0;I have to grow these expensive Skeletons. &#xA0;I might have to fight more to lower the cost of labor.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Whistling shrugged his shoulders.</span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan spoke to Whistling.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I&#x2019;ll see you next time. &#xA0;Ah. &#xA0;If someone bothers you, you can contact me. &#xA0;I&#x2019;ll completely destroy them. &#xA0;In truth, that is my specialty. &#xA0;I mow down bastards, who act arrogant, because they have a little bit of power.</span></p><p><span style="">Whistling let out snort at Hyrkan&#x2019;s unexpected words.</span></p><p><span style="">When Whistling let out a smirk of disbelief, Hyrkan kept speaking.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I&#x2019;m not kidding. &#xA0;I&#x2026;. &#xA0;In the past&#x2026; &#xA0;Yes, in my last game, I was nicknamed the Hero Slaughterer. &#xA0;I took down arrogant Rankers like a demon.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;It is a great nickname.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;It was a great nickname.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">After those words ended, the conversation came to a brief pause.</span></p><p><span style="">What else was there to talk about?</span></p><p><span style="">It will leave much to be desired if they just parted ways right now. &#xA0;They tried to come up with a topic they could talk about.</span></p><p><span style="">Still, they would have to part in the end.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I&#x2019;ll see you.......&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">It was unknown as to when they&#x2019;ll meet again, but there was no need to forcefully prolong a conversation.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Let&#x2019;s have a beer sometime.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;You want to meet in real life? &#xA0;Wouldn&#x2019;t that be a little bit too hard?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">At Hyrkan&#x2019;s question, Whistling spoke calmly.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;It wouldn&#x2019;t be too hard for me to go to Korea. &#xA0;It isn&#x2019;t as if I&#x2019;m barred from going there. &#xA0;If you are in North Korea, it might be hard.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan slightly reacted to the word Korea.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;How did you know I&#x2019;m Korean? &#xA0;Ah. &#xA0;I guess my Hahoe Mask gave it away.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Even as Hyrkan spoke the words, he laughed. &#xA0;Even the youtube page managed by Hyrkan was littered with images of the Hahoe Mask, and he always wore one. &#xA0;It was an overwhelming evidence that indicated Hyrkan was Korean.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Even if you didn&#x2019;t have the Hahoe Mask, it isn&#x2019;t too hard to figure out that you are a Korean.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">However, the surest evidence that labeled Hyrkan as a Korean was elsewhere.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Whenever a game comes out, nine out of the ten Users, who rush to the end of the game, are Koreans.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan&#x2019;s game style was the prototypical game style of a Korean.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Isn&apos;t that to be expected? &#xA0;You start a game to reach the end.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Whistling closed both his eyes, and he nodded his head. &#xA0;Whistling finally confirmed what the Hahoe Mask was pursuing &#xA0;in this game.</span></p><p><span style="">Moreover, Hyrkan also came to an understanding too.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I&#x2019;ll see you soon.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;If someone messes with you, just contact me.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">They parted ways.</span></p><p><span style="">This was when the others moved in.</span></p><p><span style="">2.</span></p><p><span style="">Over 10 Users stepped forward. &#xA0;At a glance, one could tell they were equipped with sturdy-looking armors and helmets. &#xA0;They even had their swords unsheathed, and they looked as if they were prepared to cut down any enemies that got in their way.</span></p><p><span style="">The members of the Big Smiles appeared to surround them. &#xA0;This should have surprised Whistling, but he snorted instead.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Hoong.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">He snorted as he sized up his opponents.</span></p><p><span style="">&apos;Are they from the Big Smile guild?&apos;</span></p><p><span style="">It wasn&#x2019;t just Whistling. &#xA0;This should have been a surprising situation, yet Yojori and Joba wasn&#x2019;t acting surprised at all.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;It has been awhile, since we&#x2019;ve fought like this.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Give me a buff.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Give me one first.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Don&#x2019;t be so shameful.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Shameful? &#xA0;Maybe I shouldn&#x2019;t give you a buff if you act that way.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Yojori and Joba looked very relaxed as they got ready for battle. &#xA0;Yojori put a buff on herself, and Joba immediately activated the [Body Revolution] Skill. &#xA0;It was a skill that flipped the the Intelligence Stat with the Strength Stat.</span></p><p><span style="">While the two bickered with each other, Whistling held a conversation as his opponent spoke first.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;You are Whistling of the Hydra Guild?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Whistling smirked at the question.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;You don&#x2019;t recognize my face? &#xA0;I never expected someone to check my identity twice. &#xA0;I guess my face is more common than I realized.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;We are from the Big Smiles guild.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Their opponents didn&#x2019;t hide their guild affiliation. &#xA0;Even if they wanted to hide it, they couldn&#x2019;t. &#xA0;This was the entrance to the Highwood Forest, and the nearby region was the territory of the Big Smiles guild. &#xA0;&#xA0;If a large group of Users were able to move through this region, it pretty much labeled them as members of the Big Smiles guild. &#xA0;The only other User that could pass through this region with impunity was the Hahoe Mask.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Also, the Highwood Forest is under our control. &#xA0;This has been confirmed by the 30 great guilds. &#xA0;Your guild hadn&#x2019;t asked for permission to hunt here. &#xA0;You&#x2019;ve participated in an illegal hunt inside the Highwood Forest, so what is your excuse?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">They revealed their intention.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Hoong.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Whistling once again snorted.</span></p><p><span style="">&apos;How laughable.&apos;</span></p><p><span style="">Their words were disingenuous. &#xA0;They just wanted Whistling to say something they could use as a pretext to an attack. &#xA0;If he made an excuse, he would be admitting he had done something wrong. &#xA0;They wanted to exact a pound of flesh from Whistling.</span></p><p><span style="">In such a situation, Whistling wasn&#x2019;t going to make any excuses. &#xA0;He didn&#x2019;t plan on debasing himself like that. &#xA0;He decided to cleanly settle the account. &#xA0;If they wanted to exact a price, he&#x2019;ll pay.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;First, I am part of the Hydra guild. &#xA0;I&#x2019;ll apologize for hunting in a hunting ground recognized officially to be under the control of the Big Smiles guild. &#xA0;Next, what if I give back an equal compensation? &#xA0;What if we do it through our guild?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Even as he spoke, Whistling was already aware of what they wanted. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">If they really wanted a monetary compensation or an official apology, they would merely have to send the footage of Whistling&#x2019;s party hunting inside the Highwood Forest to the Hydra guild. &#xA0;Then the guilds would negotiate to bring this issue to a conclusion. &#xA0;This was the normal procedure. &#xA0;It was clean, and the trouble ended right there. </span></p><p><span style="">There was no reason for the 10 Users of high level showing signs of wanting to fight him. &#xA0;Moreover, they had waited for Whistling to come out. &#xA0;They wasted time by waiting for him. &#xA0;This basically meant they didn&#x2019;t want monetary compensation or an apology from the guild.</span></p><p><span style="">They wanted the opposite.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Are the Hydra guild looking down on the Big Smiles guild? &#xA0;Huh? &#xA0;Or is this an attempt at a revenge? &#xA0;Are you trying to avenge your 2nd Head, who was killed by Killer?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">It seemed they didn&#x2019;t want to bring the guilds into this. &#xA0;They wanted to resolve this as a personal issue.</span></p><p><span style="">In Warlord, a personal problem like this was very simple to resolve.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;We don&#x2019;t look down on the Big Smiles guild. &#xA0;However, you brought a dozen Users, who are higher in level than us, to catch the three of us. &#xA0;I think that is funny.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Ooh-ha-ha&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Joba let out a big laugh. &#xA0;It was a true laugh. &#xA0;It was a laugh full of ridicule, and it was very effective.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Are you trying to pick a fight with us?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Did you really think we would beg for our lives? &#xA0;Is that what you want to hear?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;It seems words will be useless.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Run!&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">It happened in a flash.</span></p><p><span style="">While they were having a conversation, Whistling let out a short command, and he launched himself towards the User, who he was having conversation with.</span></p><p><span style="">Kwahg!</span></p><p><span style="">Whistling used Body Slam to make the other User fall.</span></p><p><span style="">Pah-aht!</span></p><p><span style="">In a flash, Yojori and Joba stepped on Whistling&#x2019;s body to launch themselves forward. &#xA0;They used the gap opened by Whistling to quickly run away.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;We&#x2019;ll go there first!&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;We&#x2019;ll complete the Quest!&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Their footsteps were as rapid as their spoken words. &#xA0;They were experienced in running for an extended amount of time for the sake of completing a Quest. &#xA0;It wouldn&#x2019;t be a misnomer to say their running away speed was on the level of the Hahoe Mask.</span></p><p><span style="">Still, their trackers weren&#x2019;t average Users. &#xA0;The rest of the group reacted immediately to such a sudden change in the situation. &#xA0;They immediately prepared to run after Yojori and Joba. &#xA0;Three Users had already ran forward to track them.</span></p><p><span style="">While this was going on, Whistling stood back up, and he turned to look at the Users, who had stayed behind. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">The already scary face of Whistling crumpled, and he looked more menacing. &#xA0;Just his appearance made one clench one&#x2019;s teeth.</span></p><p><span style="">While looking like this this, Whistling barked out like an angry fighting dog. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Come at me!&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">3.</span></p><p><span style="">[Hyrkan]</span></p><p><span style="">- Level : 240</span></p><p><span style="">-Class : Lich</span></p><p><span style="">-Title : 245</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2013; Stats : Strength(</span><span style="">3219</span><span style="">)/Stamina(</span><span style="">2009</span><span style="">)/Intelligence(</span><span style="">2101</span><span style="">)/Magic Power(</span><span style="">2373</span><span style="">)</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2013; In possession of the Ancient Power of &apos;Frost&apos;.</span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan checked his Stats on the Bone Wyvern as he flew towards the Heard Fortress ruin.</span></p><p><span style="">&apos;I gained a lot from this hunt.&apos;</span></p><p><span style="">His battles always caused him to suffer losses, but he had gained a lot on this venture. &#xA0;First, he had reached level 240. &#xA0;He was able to acquire the level 230 Skills called [Ice Golem] and [Skeleton Exhibition]. &#xA0;&#xA0;The highlight of this venture was the [Skeleton Exhibition].</span></p><p><span style="">The [Skeleton Exhibition] was a similar to the Death Knight&#x2019;s [Commander] Skill.</span></p><p><span style="">The [Skeleton Exhibition] was akin to the default ability of the Death Knight in being able to summon 12 Skeleton underlings. &#xA0;The Skill allowed all Skeleton Fragments stored in the Skeleton Exhibition to be summoned all at once. &#xA0;This was why it was called an Exhibition. &#xA0;He had to store the Skeleton Fragments as exhibits. &#xA0;Of course, there was a quota on how many Skeleton Fragments one could put in.</span></p><p><span style="">The Skeletons summoned through this method was separate from him normal Skeleton summons. &#xA0;When he reached Rank A in the [Skeleton Exhibition] Skill, he would be able to handle nearly 100 Skeletons at the same time.</span></p><p><span style="">The level 230 Skill called [Ice Golem] was something he could learn at a later date. &#xA0;In truth, he didn&#x2019;t need the Skill right now. &#xA0;In Hyrkan&#x2019;s case, the Earth Golem had similar powers to the Ice Golem if he activated the power of Frost. &#xA0;Still, there was no downside in having the skill.</span></p><p><span style="">He also earned 4 scrolls containing the Ancient Power. &#xA0;He had three Transcendent Rank scrolls, and the high price he paid for them was as expensive as the Item&#x2019;s name implied. &#xA0;However, Hyrkan didn&#x2019;t think it was expensive. &#xA0;Moreover, his greatest gain was the Legendary Rank scroll. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">He was in a happy spot again.</span></p><p><span style="">He had found the clue, and he now knew what methods were used to hide the ruins within the Red Desert. &#xA0;Moreover, he also found the identity of the Elven Artifact. &#xA0;If things turn out well, he&#x2019;ll receive help from Whistling, and he&#x2019;ll be able to progress in his Quest more easily. &#xA0;At the very least, he won&#x2019;t be digging a bottomless hole.</span></p><p><span style="">On top of everything, he had gained a friend named Whistling.</span></p><p><span style="">&apos;A friend.......&apos;</span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan let out a bitter laugh.</span></p><p><span style="">He never thought he would get close to someone within this game ever again. &#xA0;He had avoided developing any deep relationships. &#xA0;He never wanted to suffer that bitter sense of betrayal ever again. &#xA0;He never wanted to buck under the misery he had felt before. &#xA0;He had tried his best to avoid such a relationship, yet his current situation made Hyrkan smile.</span></p><p><span style="">&apos;........I wonder what Dongsoo hyung is doing right now? &#xA0;Is he playing this game?&apos;</span></p><p><span style="">If he continued playing Warlord, he knew this was something he would inevitably have to confront. &#xA0;Hyrkan&#x2019;s life had changed a lot, because of Warlord. &#xA0;He would continue this way of life, and he wouldn&#x2019;t be free of his past until he reached the end of Warlord.</span></p><p><span style="">He had no intentions of becoming free from Warlord right now.</span></p><p><span style="">&apos;Yes. &#xA0;Since things have progress this far, I have to see this to the end.&apos;</span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan arrived at the Heard Fortress ruin town on his Bone Wyvern, and the news about Whistling greeted him.</span></p><p><span style="">4.</span></p><p><span style="">Ahn-jaehyun was looking through the the articles. &#xA0;He focused on searching for the words Hydra and Big Smiles. &#xA0;However, there weren&#x2019;t many articles of substance compared to the effort he was putting into this search.</span></p><p><span style="">Ahn-jaehyun stopped searching for the articles for a moment. &#xA0;He took off his glasses with one hand, and he massaged his eyes with the other.</span></p><p><span style="">&apos;Did the 30 great guilds have some kind of grudge against me in the past life&#x2026; Nevermind. &#xA0;I guess they were always my mortal enemy.&apos;</span></p><p><span style="">Whistling had been killed by the Big Smiles guild.</span></p><p><span style="">When he heard the news, Ahn-jaehyun immediately exited the game. &#xA0;Then he brooded over his anger. &#xA0;He was having a hard time coping with his anger, but he didn&#x2019;t throw anything towards the wall.</span></p><p><span style="">&apos;Before I returned to the past, it was the Stormhunters. &#xA0;Will it be the Big Smiles now?&apos;</span></p><p><span style="">In some ways, this might have been inevitable.</span></p><p><span style="">&apos;Yes, it is time for me to bring this to a head.&apos;</span></p><p><span style="">The Big Smiles had put out a statement saying Whistling had hunted in the Highwood Forest without permission, and his death had been a fair punishment.</span></p><p><span style="">They weren&#x2019;t wrong. &#xA0;Most would accept the the substance behind the Big Smiles guild&#x2019;s announcement.</span></p><p><span style="">&apos;They could have tried to kill us when I was with them. &#xA0;They killed him after I left&#x2026;.&apos;</span></p><p><span style="">The problem was the fact that they didn&#x2019;t attack them when the Hahoe Mask and Whistling was together. &#xA0;They targeted Whistling after the Hahoe Mask left.</span></p><p><span style="">It was a clear provocation. &#xA0;Since they couldn&#x2019;t take on the Hahoe Mask right now, they decided to punish those close to the Hahoe Mask. &#xA0;This was the substance behind the provocation.</span></p><p><span style="">&apos;They were not aiming for me. &#xA0;They were aiming for my friend&#x2026;.&apos;</span></p><p><span style="">This was an obvious provocation, and he was sure it would be exploited again in the future.</span></p><p><span style="">&apos;These bastards are coming at me in interesting ways.&apos;</span></p><p><span style="">There were only two choices he could choose.</span></p><p><span style="">He could respond to the provocation or he could just endure this.</span></p><p><span style="">If he looked at it in a logical manner, it would be harmful for the Hahoe Mask to respond to this provocation. &#xA0;The Hahoe Mask couldn&#x2019;t erased Big Smiles guild from Warlord. &#xA0;&#xA0;Even if they got into a straight fight, it would be a battle of attrition. &#xA0;Moreover, even if the Hahoe Mask attacked the Big Smiles guild and won, he wouldn&#x2019;t be able to steal their Live Channel.</span></p><p><span style="">&apos;I can just trivialize this by saying Whistling only suffered a death&#x2026;.&apos;</span></p><p><span style="">Whistling didn&apos;t consider his death to be a loss. &#xA0;He had lost a single Item, and he could take a break for 48 hours. &#xA0;That was the extent of his damage, so Whistling didn&#x2019;t ask anything of the Hahoe Mask. &#xA0;He hadn&#x2019;t even notified Hyrkan of his plight. &#xA0;He decided to keep it as a personal matter. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">He didn&#x2019;t want to unnecessarily put his friend in an awkward situation.</span></p><p><span style="">&apos;Still, the mighty Hahoe Mask can&#x2019;t hide behind his mask. &#xA0;A friend had suffered.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">In other words, his friend was killed, and if he thought only about calculating profits, he was being unfaithful to his friend.</span></p><p><span style="">&apos;Moreover, if I show weakness here, it&#x2019;ll be the end.&apos;</span></p><p><span style="">Above everything else, it was time.</span></p><p><span style="">He had to step on the 30 great guilds at some point in time. &#xA0;If he wanted to reach his goal, he had to use the 30 great guilds as his stepping stone. &#xA0;He had to climb upwards by stepping on them. &#xA0;Moreover, he had numerous methods he could use to conduct this war.</span></p><p><span style="">When he suffered under the Stormhunters guild, he had come up with a lot of methods for his revenge. &#xA0;The tactics, strategies and tricks he came up with was etched clearly inside his head.</span></p><p><span style="">At the time, it was impossible to pull off these methods. &#xA0;However, he now had the Level, Items and money he could use unsparingly.</span></p><p><span style="">&apos;The title of the video....... I think I&#x2019;ll call it Giant Killer.&apos;</span></p><p><span style="">Ahn-jaehyun&#x2019;s face was reflected on the Tablet PC, and one could see a smile on his lips.</span></p>
