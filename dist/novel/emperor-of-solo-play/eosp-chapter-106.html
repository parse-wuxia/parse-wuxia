<p><span style="">Chapter 106 - Catacombs (1)</span></p><p><span style="">Cursed Domain.</span></p><p><span style="">The powerful monsters called Voodoo Chimera were swarming this location. This was a difficult stage where a User had to be at least a certain level to play here. Moreover, the Evil Eyes appeared intermittently. If one wanted to block the Evil Eye&apos;s Curse, one had to finish the Quest to get &apos;Sarabo&apos;s Charm&apos;. &#xA0;Even Users well over level 140 were ruthlessly sent back to reality if one didn&apos;t have &apos;Sarabo&apos;s Charm&apos;.</span></p><p><span style="">Moreover, this location didn&apos;t drop really good Items, and the EXP wasn&apos;t that great considering the difficulty of the Voodoo Chimera hunt. &#xA0;The method to clearing the Voodoo Chimera was still under research.</span></p><p><span style="">From that perspective, this was really a cursed place for high level Users, who sought efficiency in their hunts. &#xA0;They should have had no reason or interest in stepping onto this stage.</span></p><p><span style="">However, there were an unusual amount of high level users hanging around the Cursed Domain. &#xA0;These Users were all over level 140.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What&apos;s the status of the Quests?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;There&apos;s definitely a variety of Quests here compared to other locations. &#xA0;There are more Search Quests and Commission Quests compared to the simple Hunt Quests.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">After the Noopy Family arrived at the Cursed Castle, a branch office of the Subjugation Association was established inside the Cursed Castle.</span></p><p><span style="">At the same time, the Cursed Castle received a respectable name called Heuban&apos;s Castle.</span></p><p><span style="">The NPC related to the Subjugation Association revealed new NPCs that started to fill up the Heuban&apos;s Castle.</span></p><p><span style="">This was the reason why the Users were coming here.</span></p><p><span style="">New NPCs had appeared. &#xA0;New Quests meant opportunity.</span></p><p><span style="">The Cursed Domain was the land of opportunity.</span></p><p><span style="">This was what the Cursed Castle had turned into.</span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan arrived at the Heuban&apos;s Castle.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Who is that?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Who?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;The Sword Class User over there.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;You mean the Swordsman wearing the Rusted Steel set? &#xA0;Who cares? Isn&apos;t the Rusted Steel set a level 90 defensive set? &#xA0;Maybe he came here to sightsee. &#xA0;Don&apos;t pay attention to him.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">He came in secret.</span></p><p><span style="">He hadn&apos;t worn his custom Red Skeleton set given to him by his unknown benefactor. &#xA0;He wore the defensive gear that had been previously equipped by his Skeleton. &#xA0;He had appeared with his identity hidden.</span></p><p><span style="">There was simple reason why he had hidden his identity.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;If I&apos;m following the map correctly, the Secret Entrance should be over there.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">Dungeon.</span></p><p><span style="">This was the reason why he had hidden his identity.</span></p><p><span style="">Maeung had given Hyrkan a map that showed where the secret Dungeon was located beneath the Cursed Castle.</span></p><p><span style="">It was described as being a secret region of the castle, but it was basically a Dungeon. &#xA0;This was an obvious thing to say, but it wouldn&apos;t be great if this information was leaked.</span></p><p><span style="">Moreover, the Users that were operating out of the Cursed Castle right now were like demons, who knew the ins and out of Warlord.</span></p><p><span style="">The Users were here on the off chance that an unexpected opportunity might pop up. </span></p><p><span style="">If Hyrkan operated in this region as the Hahoe Mask, he would be like a mother duck with its ducklings following after it. &#xA0;He&apos;ll have a large tail of Users following after him.</span></p><p><span style="">Anyways, Hyrkan&apos;s effort had been a success. &#xA0;None of the Users within the Cursed Castle paid any attention to him. &#xA0;This expedited his progress in getting to his destination.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Uh?&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">At that moment, something had suddenly attracted Hyrkan&apos;s attention.</span></p><p><span style="">It was a statue.</span></p><p><span style="">It was a statue of several Users in a heroic pose. &#xA0;They were the four heroes, who had killed the first Evil Eye. They had also reached the Cursed Castle first. &#xA0;The Subjugation Association had created a statue of the Noopy Family.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Shit.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">Of course, the Noopy family had more or less stolen the Sarabo&apos;s Sword from under him. &#xA0;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;The Options on that Item was killer.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">The Options for the Sarabo&apos;s Sword had been immediately posted online. Hyrkan gritted his teeth when he thought about it.</span></p><p><span style="">As a level 140 Unique Rank Item, the Sarabo&apos;s Sword had great Options. &#xA0;At the same time, the Item was tradeable, and it was high in scarcity.</span></p><p><span style="">If he had sold it for a high price, he would have been able to make some eye-popping amount of money.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;If it hadn&apos;t been for that son of a bitch...&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">If Sinclair hadn&apos;t interfered, the Item would have been in the possession of Hyrkan.</span></p><p><span style="">When he thought about the situation, it made his inside burn even if he was inside the game.</span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan shook his head from side to side.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;If I get a little bit stronger, I&apos;ll keep hunting him down until this game closes it service.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">He made a resolution as he shook his head.</span></p><p><span style="">At the same time...</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Please let there be something amazing in this Dungeon.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">He prayed earnestly.</span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan&#x2019;s thoughts were very busy in many aspects.</span></p><p><span style="">Koohng! </span></p><p><span style="">The ceiling of the pitch black tunnel fell. &#xA0;When the bricks forming the ceiling hit the ground, the rugged sound rang out. As if he was trying to quell the rugged sound from ringing out, a person fell through the ceiling! &#xA0;He let out a minimum amount of sound as he landed, and he immediately manipulated the watch on his wrist.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Slot on.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">He yelled out a short phrase.</span></p><p><span style="">The armor made out of red bones appeared.</span></p><p><span style="">The owner of the Red Skeleton set was Hyrkan. &#xA0;After he finished the Item Switching, he held his breath as he listened to his surrounding.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;There&apos;s nothing nearby.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">Fortunately, he didn&apos;t hear anything out of the ordinary.</span></p><p><span style="">Afterwards, Hyrkan let out a complaint.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Why isn&apos;t there any Announcements? Usually there should be an Announcement regarding a User entering the Dungeon. &#xA0;Where&apos;s the announcement for the Titles?&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan turned on the light app on his wrist watch after he complained couple more times.</span></p><p><span style="">Paht! </span></p><p><span style="">The light source was small, but the powerful light illuminated the surrounding. &#xA0;It allowed Hyrkan to be able to estimate the size of the tunnel.</span></p><p><span style="">The tunnel was quite large. &#xA0;From the floor to the ceiling, there was a distance of about 3 meters. &#xA0;The width was slightly less than 5 meters. &#xA0;Most family cars could drive through this tunnel.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;I&apos;m pretty sure I&apos;m at the right place....&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan was relieved when he saw the size of the tunnel. A tunnel of this size wouldn&#x2019;t be used as an escape tunnel. &#xA0;This meant this tunnel was built for a different purpose.</span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan stealthily took out a single Skeleton Fragment. &#xA0;He summoned the Skeleton Knight. &#xA0;As soon as he summoned it, Hyrkan placed the light app on top of the Skeleton Knight&apos;s head.</span></p><p><span style="">The Skeleton Knight had become a walking light bulb. &#xA0;Hyrkan decided to reward his Skeleton Knight. &#xA0;He activated the Madness Helm then he summoned the Bone Armor. &#xA0;He also placed Curses on the sword being held by the Skeleton Knight.</span></p><p><span style="">How long had he been walking?</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;All right.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">The material making up the tunnel had changed, then a straight road suddenly appeared. </span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan could sense something had changed.</span></p><p><span style="">[You&apos;ve entered the Dungeon &apos;Catacombs&apos;.] </span></p><p><span style="">[You&apos;ve earned the title &#x2018;Visitor of the Catacombs&#x2019;.] </span></p><p><span style="">[You&apos;ve earned the title &#x2018;Awakened from Slumber&#x2019;.] </span></p><p><span style="">The Announcements he heard immediately confirmed his suspicions. &#xA0;A smile formed on Hyrkan&apos;s lips.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Yes. This is it.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">At the same time as the Announcements, a noise intruded into the quiet space.</span></p><p><span style="">Ddul-goo-ruhk, ddul-goo-ruhk.</span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan heard a very familiar sound.</span></p><p><span style="">The smile on Hyrkan&apos;s lips shited in an odd way.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;What the hell?&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">Eventually, a skeletal version of a Voodoo Chimera appeared in front of the Skeleton Knight. &#xA0;It was none other than the Chimera Skeleton. The smile around Hyrkan&apos;s lips turned into a sneer.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Would you look at this?&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">It was rusty, but the Chimera Skeleton was fully equipped. &#xA0;The Chimera Skeleton had a presence couldn&apos;t be ignored.</span></p><p><span style="">Moreover, there were two of them. &#xA0;It felt as if the tunnel was packed, and it inevitably increased the pressure given off by the monsters.</span></p><p><span style="">If he had been a normal User, he would have been nervous in this situation.</span></p><p><span style="">However, the monsters were laughable to Hyrkan.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Who do you think I am? &#xA0;How dare a Skeleton show themselves in front of me!&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan didn&apos;t summon any additional additional Skeleton Warriors or Magicians. &#xA0;He didn&apos;t even summon his Golem. He spoke in a low voice as he stood behind the Skeleton Knight.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;If you get killed by such opponents, get ready to dodge my fists every day in training when I summon you the next time.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">It was as if the Skeleton Knight understood what had been said by Hyrkan. &#xA0;The Skeleton Knight opened its mouth wider than usual, and it unhesitatingly charged towards its enemies.</span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan&apos;s Skeleton Knight skill was Rank C. It was a case where the Rank was rising much faster than Hyrkan&apos;s level. &#xA0;It was evidence that the Skeleton Knight had performed more brilliantly than he had expected.</span></p><p><span style="">Moreover, every one of his summoned Skeletons were influenced by the Rank A Skeleton Science skill. &#xA0;It increased all stats of the Skeleton by 30%. &#xA0;On top of that, the Skeleton Knight was using the Madness Helm skill. &#xA0;The Rank A Madness Helm had the effect of increasing all stats by 30%.</span></p><p><span style="">It didn&apos;t end there. &#xA0;There was something else that could also be used by the Skeleton Knight.</span></p><p><span style="">It was the Rank A Bone Armor. &#xA0;A layer of sturdy Bone Armor protected the Skeleton Knight&apos;s entire body.</span></p><p><span style="">Of course, the Bone Armor was inferior to Rare Rank defensive sets.</span></p><p><span style="">However, the Rank A Armament skill allowed Hyrkan to equip the Skeleton Knight with the Clear Spider set and the Gargoyle Knight&apos;s sword. The Bone Armor was like a coating laminated over steel. </span></p><p><span style="">As the finishing stroke, Hyrkan had trained his Skeletons everyday whenever he had some spare time. This allowed the Skeleton Warriors to be able to dodge Hyrkan&apos;s attack, who boasted a higher Strength stat than a Swordsman class. </span></p><p><span style="">These were the reasons why Hyrkan&apos;s pride wouldn&apos;t let his Skeleton Knight lose to a similarly equipped Skeleton monsters. </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes. That&apos;s right! Drill him!&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">The Skeleton Knight was defending Hyrkan&apos;s pride. &#xA0;The Skeleton Knight cornered the two Chimera Skeletons, who were blocking the tunnel.</span></p><p><span style="">Hweeeek! </span></p><p><span style="">In the small space, the Skeleton Knight easily dodged the halberds swung by the Chimera Skeletons. &#xA0;The Skeleton Knight immediately swung its petrified sword towards the Chimera Skeleton&apos;s armor.</span></p><p><span style="">Kwah-jeek! </span></p><p><span style="">The one-sided attack continued, and the Chimera Skeleton&apos;s armor was turned into junk. &#xA0;The only thing left was to trash the Chimera Skeleton&apos;s body.</span></p><p><span style="">From the back, Hyrkan touched his Bone Explosives and Skeleton Fragments.</span></p><p><span style="">The sight in front of Hyrkan was satisfying.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;My hard labor was worth it.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">It felt akin to your kid getting into a named university. &#xA0;He truly felt that way.</span></p><p><span style="">At the same time, he gained confidence. </span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;I&apos;m better than Rich Lich.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">He was confident in that statement now. Hyrkan had built himself up to a point where he had jumped over his role model, Rich Lich.</span></p><p><span style="">The only thing he was lacking was funds. &#xA0;If he had the funds, Hyrkan could do everything that had been shown to him by Rich Lich.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Yes. &#xA0;All I need is money.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">Of course, money was the source of his biggest problem.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;If I had money, nothing would be impossible in the first place.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan was like a parent with a child, who was about to enter into college. &#xA0;He felt a feeling akin to a parent worrying about the school tuition.</span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan was growing at an incredibly fast pace. He didn&apos;t have to worry about the front-runners anymore. Several Users suspected the secret to the ridiculous fighting abilities of the Skeleton Warriors. &#xA0;They were attempting to grow a Necromancer like the Hahoe Mask. &#xA0;However, Hyrkan didn&apos;t feel threatened by them. &#xA0;He wouldn&apos;t have to worry about any of them unless someone gets hit by a truck and that someone is sent back into the past.</span></p><p><span style="">The problem was the fact that Hyrkan would truly be competing against talented individuals, who had dedicated their lives to Warlord. &#xA0;He would have to compete again those who achieved a lot in this game through their effort and talent.</span></p><p><span style="">Moreover, the market for the Items he would use will change now. &#xA0;If Hyrkan wanted to get the best quality Items befitting his level, his funds would be inadequate to the task.</span></p><p><span style="">Even if he did have the funds, he would run into those, who would halt a deal, because of who he was.</span></p><p><span style="">When his train of thought reached that point, Hyrkan&apos;s expression cooled off.</span></p><p><span style="">His Skeleton Knight&apos;s performance had heated up his heart, but now it had cooled off.</span></p><p><span style="">His cooled heart directed Hyrkan&apos;s hand to move. &#xA0;Hyrkan took out several Skeleton Fragments, and he threw it over the Chimera Skeletons. The Skeleton Warriors formed behind the Chimera Skeletons. &#xA0;They opened their mouth wide as they waited for his command.</span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan flicked his finger twice.</span></p><p><span style="">As if the Skeleton Warriors were trying to console their master, they leapt into action.</span></p>
