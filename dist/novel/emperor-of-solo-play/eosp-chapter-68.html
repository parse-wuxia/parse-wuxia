<p><strong>Chapter 68 Helm Ogre (1).</strong></p><div id="chapterContent" class="innerContent fr-view"><p>Chapter 68 - Helm Ogre (1)</p><p>[Your Level has risen.]</p><p>A pleasant sound was heard.</p><p>&#x2018;It won&#x2019;t give me any time to rest.&#x2019;</p><p>However, the moment Hyrkan heard the announcement for his level up, he frowned instead of having a happy smile on his face. &#xA0;He threw his body towards the battlefield in front of his eyes.</p><p>Hyrkan ran towards a battlefield that held two 3 meter giants with black and ragged skin. &#xA0;They had rock-like skins. &#xA0;Seven Skeleton Warriors, and a golem was nearby.</p><p>Level 90 monster. &#xA0;Black Troll.</p><p>Their tough skin meant they had high defense, and they also possessed an astonishing regeneration ability. &#xA0;They also gave a very substantial amount of EXP. This monster had ruthlessly swung its club at Hyrkan a moment ago.</p><p>He was sent flying after a critical hit. &#xA0;After Hyrkan healed his wound, he was about to eat a consumable item when he leveled up as one of the Black Troll died.</p><p>The level up bonus recovered him fully. &#xA0;Since his Stamina and Magic was filled to the brim, Hyrkan got a little bit of a breathing room.</p><p>&#x2018;This is so tiring.&#x2019;</p><p>He swallowed his complaints. &#xA0;The Black Troll ran towards him, and its club came down like lightning. &#xA0;He sidestepped the blow, then he slid between the Black Troll&#x2019;s legs to escape.</p><p>Then he quickly came to a stop.</p><p>After a quickly leap, he stabbed the White Mamba Fang Sword into the Black Troll&#x2019;s back.</p><p>Poo-oohk!</p><p>White Mamba Fang Sword. &#xA0;It was a level 70 Unique Rank Item. &#xA0;The main attribute of items were assigned randomly. &#xA0;Instead of Strength and Stamina, it rolled Wisdom and Magic. &#xA0;Hyrkan had purchased it at a cheap price at auction. Even at a very conservative price, he had purchased it for 38,000 gold.</p><p>For the general public, it was a ridiculous price, but Hyrkan felt as if the price had been a bargain.</p><p>[The Black Troll was poisoned by the White Mamba&#x2019;s Venom.]</p><p>White Mamba Fang Sword&#x2019;s secondary attribute, Poisoning!</p><p>The damage caused by the Poisoning was quite strong. Moreover, the Poisoning Magic worked very well against Trolls, who had a powerful skin regenerative property. &#xA0;Even if its regeneration was strong, there was still a finite HP. &#xA0;Its HP didn&#x2019;t recover. &#xA0;It only recovered its wounds. &#xA0;The effect of the poison continued as it disregarded the regeneration ability.</p><p>Moreover, the sword&#x2019;s damage was also powerful. &#xA0;This fact was evident when the sword pierced through the very thick leather of the Black Troll in a single breath.</p><p>When the sword was embedded deep, the Balck Troll&#x2019;s regeneration ability activated. &#xA0;Its skin started to regenerate around the still embedded sword. Hyrkan had a bloody smile on his face. &#xA0;With both his hands holding the sword, he pressed both his feet against the Troll&#x2019;s back. He looked akin to a climber using rock climbing techniques.</p><p>He was skillful and sure in his techniques.</p><p>There was a reason why Warlord users took the Climbing Test. In Warlord, the Rock Climbing technique was an absolute requisite skill. &#xA0;It was used, while fighting against any monsters over midsize. &#xA0;If one was capable of sticking to the monster&#x2019;s body, it gave one the opportunity to give constant damage to the monster.</p><p>Choo-roong!</p><p>In this position, Hyrkan unsheathed his other sword from his waist, then he tirelessly moved the blade to make countless cuts on the Black Troll&#x2019;s back.</p><p>Sss-ooht, sss-ooht!</p><p>Every time he made a mark with his sword, he saw the wound heal immediately. &#xA0;It was a chilling sight. However, the damage was most definitely accumulating, and the Black Troll&#x2019;s HP was quickly and abruptly decreasing.</p><p>Ooh-uhuh!</p><p>Finally, the Black Troll turned his attention toward Hyrkan. The aggro was steered towards Hyrkan. &#xA0;The Black Troll started struggling to catch Hyrkan, who was stuck to the Black Troll&#x2019;s back.</p><p>The Black Troll didn&#x2019;t perceive the Skeleton Warriors in the front holding terrifying weapons.</p><p>It was a mistake.</p><p>What&#x2019;s worse, the Skeleton Warrior that had been facing the Black Troll earlier was the Black Orc Skeleton Warrior with the Orc Hero&#x2019;s Sword in his grasp. &#xA0;The sword had the power to ignore the target&#x2019;s defense&#x2026;</p><p>Suh-guhk, suh-guhk!</p><p>In a flash, he dealt significant damage to both its knees. &#xA0;It wasn&#x2019;t a wound the Black Troll could ignore. &#xA0;Moreover, that wasn&#x2019;t the end of it.</p><p>Ddul-goo-ruk, ddul-goo-ruk!</p><p>The Skeleton Warriors didn&#x2019;t let this opportunity pass. &#xA0;They ran towards the Black Troll, while making bone rattles. There was a horn attached to their skulls. &#xA0;It was the Madness Helm, and it made them much more fearsome. &#xA0;Moreover, through Hyrkan&#x2019;s repeated teachings and continuous battles, the combat AI of the Skeleton Soldiers had already reached a professional level.</p><p>When the Skeleton Warriors saw a crack, they charged forward like eels swimming towards a crack.</p><p>After they ran in&#x2026;.</p><p>Pook, shweek, kook!</p><p>All kinds of sounds that could be made by swords hitting flesh was made.</p><p>Ooh-uhuh!</p><p>The Black Troll&#x2019;s yell spread out wide into the surrounding. &#xA0;During all of this, Hyrkan tirelessly moved his sword. &#xA0;As if Hyrkan was trying to pull a sword out of the ground, he put both feet on the Black Troll&#x2019;s back, and he pulled out the White Mamba Fang Sword.</p><p>Pooh-haht!</p><p>He extracted his sword, and an arc of blood fountained into the air. &#xA0;Hyrkan dismounted to the floor. &#xA0;Hyrkan rolled once as he dropped, and he came to his feet unharmed.</p><p>Ooh-oh?</p><p>The being that had been frustrating the Black Troll by skillfully attacking its back had fallen to the floor. &#xA0;The Black Troll turned his head towards Hyrkan.</p><p>It meant he turned his back on the Skeleton Warriors, who had been tormenting the Black Troll!</p><p>Sheek!</p><p>Hyrkan had a deep smile underneath the Hahoe Mask.</p><p>[Hyrkan]</p><p>&#x2013; Level : 75</p><p>&#x2013; Occupation : Magician</p><p>&#x2013; Title : 39</p><p>&#x2013; Stat : Strength(649)/Stamina(219)/Intelligence(352)/Magic(467)</p><p>&#x2018;The Hunting Dog Set&#x2019;s Options are fantastic.&#x2019;</p><p>After he distributed the Stat Points earned from the level up, Hyrkan checked his Stat Window then he put on a slight smile. &#xA0;He had bought this set under the market value in preparation for reaching level 70. &#xA0;He was satisfied with the Shadow Dog Set&#x2019;s Options. &#xA0;No, it exceeded his expectation. Now that he was well-off in terms of Stats, it also enriched Hyrkan&#x2019;s heart.</p><p>Of course.</p><p>&#x2018;Still, why are there so many Shadow Dog sets being released? &#xA0;Today I saw at least 10 full sets come on the auction. Will the price drop in the future?&#x2019;</p><p>He had spent a lot of money to purchase the Shadow Dog Set. &#xA0;He paid 37,000 gold to purchase it, so this was a fresh worry for Hyrkan. Since he had invested his entire net worth into commodities, he felt like a stock broker looking at one&#x2019;s stock daily. &#xA0;He understood how they felt.</p><p>This situation was basically asking for trouble. &#xA0;Hyrkan looked at himself as he shook his head from side to side.</p><p>&#x2018;Let&#x2019;s only think about the good things. Good thoughts.&#x2019;</p><p>Hyrkan forced himself to think positive thoughts.</p><p>&#x2018;Well, my level up is progressing very well.&#x2019;</p><p>The most positive news was his level up pace. &#xA0;Currently, Hyrkan&#x2019;s level up pace was unrivaled. &#xA0;His goal was to raise 10 levels in a month. &#xA0;At this pace, he&#x2019;ll be close to becoming the top ranker within a year. Moreover, he have gained 5 levels from the Parung Forest in only 13 days. It was a very surprising level up pace. &#xA0;</p><p>&#x2018;I&#x2019;m most definitely closing the distance with the rankers.&#x2019;</p><p>Currently, the highest level on Warlord was 134. &#xA0;Of course, Perfect One Sulwoo was the one to achieve the top level. The top 100 Ranker was 125. Hyrkan was only level 75, so those levels looked very far away. &#xA0;However, Hyrkan was slowly and gradually narrowing the difference.</p><p>It was a very positive sign.</p><p>&#x2018;&#x2026;&#x2026;this was the result of too many monsters being here. &#xA0;It&#x2019;s problematic.&#x2019;</p><p>Moreover, the situation wasn&#x2019;t something normal.</p><p>Parung Forest.</p><p>It was teeming with Black Trolls over level 90. &#xA0;It also had field boss monsters like the fearsome Red Eye Ogre. &#xA0;This was the hunting ground where the so-called Red Eye appeared. It wouldn&#x2019;t have been a problem if this was the only thing he had to be worried about.</p><p>The problem was there was a very small amount of users permanently stationed at the Parung Forest. &#xA0;Moreover, not many users hunted here. Currently, the Parung Forest didn&#x2019;t even have a village nearby. Not many users used this place as their stage.</p><p>The reason behind it was complex. If one wanted to make a village here, one would need a powerful guild to make the village at Parung Forest. &#xA0;The Parung forest wasn&#x2019;t a bad hunting ground, but a lot of effort would have to be put into making the village. &#xA0;Effort wasn&#x2019;t the only problem. &#xA0;In the end, there wasn&#x2019;t a suitable location where a village could be built.</p><p>The EXP was quite nice here, but the difficulty of this location could give trouble to even the level 90 users.</p><p>Most of the current Warlord users were between latter half of lvl70 or early lvl80s. &#xA0;From their perspective, the Bulcass mountain was much better option than the Parung Forest.</p><p>There was no need to suffer by coming to the Parung Forest.</p><p>This was the reason why the Parung Forest was overflowing with monsters.</p><p>Unless there was a large influx of users to the Parung Forest, the number of monsters would continue to increase, and at a certain point, it would be too difficult to hunt here.</p><p>Of course, the practical users retreated at that point. &#xA0;There was no need to risk their lives to stay here.</p><p>However, Hyrkan had a task he must pass in the Parung Forest.</p><p>&#x2018;I&#x2019;ve searched the Parung Forest for nearly a fortnight, yet I haven&#x2019;t found any clues.&#x2019;</p><p>Maeung&#x2019;s Request.</p><p>He had to find monsters akin to the Bear Warrior. &#xA0;He needed to find a monster wearing equipment like a person.</p><p>However, to his knowledge, there weren&#x2019;t any monster wearing armor within the Parung Forest. &#xA0;The Black Trolls and the Red Eye Ogres didn&#x2019;t equip themselves with items.</p><p>&#x2018;Maybe this is like the instance of the Dragon Lizard. &#xA0;I might have come across a Quest Monster with a very low probability of&#x2026;&#x2019;</p><p>If the Parung Forest kept producing a higher number of monsters than expected, Hyrkan had no choice but to retreat. &#xA0;It would be better than dying. However, this meant his quest completion would be pushed to a later date.</p><p>Hyrkan bit hard at his lips.</p><p>&#x2018;The Strormhunters are probably about to graduate from the Bulcass mountains.&#x2019;</p><p>If Hyrkan&#x2019;s quest was delayed here, the Stormhunter&#x2019;s Quest line would converge with his.</p><p>This meant he will be in direct competition with the Stormhunter&#x2019;s guild. &#xA0;Would it be possible for Hyrkan to win against them?</p><p>The probability wasn&#x2019;t that high.</p><p>Also, he didn&#x2019;t care if some other guild overtook him, but Hyrkan&#x2019;s pride wouldn&#x2019;t allow him to fall behind the Stormhunter guild.</p><p>Hyrkan stood up.</p><p>&#x2018;Should I have entered into a community at that time?&#x2019;</p><p>At that moment, Hyrkan thought about what happened 10 days earlier.</p><p>There were only about 10 user groups operating in the Parung Forest. &#xA0;It was a very low number. &#xA0;If one considered the size of the Parung forest, it could support over 50 teams hunting at this location.</p><p>These 10 groups were composed of outstanding players. The average level of the party members was level 95. Basically, they were at the cusp of being promoted.</p><p>The users, who were at the cusp of being promoted, usually overworked themselves to quickly reach level 100. &#xA0;</p><p>It didn&#x2019;t matter if it was strenuous, hard and not profitable. &#xA0;They looked for a hunting ground where they could level up in the shortest amount of time possible.</p><p>This was also true for the Alto Family.</p><p>They were a group of 5 people, and all of them were level 98. &#xA0;They only needed 2 levels before they all reached level 100. &#xA0;They had come to the Parung forest, since they didn&#x2019;t have to worry about running out of monsters here. &#xA0;It didn&#x2019;t matter to them that this place was a much more difficult place to hunt.</p><p>It was great at first. &#xA0;The place was overflowing with monsters, and the Black Troll&#x2019;s EXP was quite substantial.</p><p>However, the Alto Family was starting to feel their limit recently.</p><p>&#x201C;Now we have to fight at least three of them at every encounter.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;If we only meet Black Trolls, we&#x2019;ll be fortunate. &#xA0;Recently, aren&#x2019;t all the Black Trolls being accompanied by smallfrys?&#x201D;</p><p>The number of monsters weren&#x2019;t decreasing. &#xA0;Instead, it was actually increasing. &#xA0;It was how the Warlord&#x2019;s Regen System was set-up. &#xA0;The Warlord Regen System took into consideration of additional users showing up at a map. &#xA0;This was why the system regenerated a higher number of monsters in the field compared to the users.</p><p>However, no new users had come to this map recently. &#xA0;Eventually, the number of monsters in the Parung forest expanded, and it was up to the users to hunt them down.</p><p>&#x201C;What&#x2019;s the status of our consumables?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;We might have to go visit the castle once. Or we might have to call in the traveling merchant. &#xA0;I don&#x2019;t think we&#x2019;ll be able to hold out until level 100.&#x201D;</p><p>The biggest problem was the party had used more consumable items than planned as they tried to survive the overtaxing battles.</p><p>&#x201C;We were so meticulous in our preparations&#x2026;.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Didn&#x2019;t you say in the beginning we wouldn&#x2019;t be able to use it all even if we tried?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;It&#x2019;s a money drain. Will we be taking a loss, because we came here?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;It&#x2019;ll be hard for us to make any profit. &#xA0;If we are lucky, we might break even.&#x201D;</p><p>The Alto family let out a sigh. &#xA0;It wasn&#x2019;t too hard to go back and restock their items. &#xA0;However, the goal of reaching level 100 would be delayed by a day or two. &#xA0;This made that option unpalatable. They were like 3 day starved dogs with food in their near future. &#xA0;Endure! &#xA0;That&#x2019;s what they told themselves. Still, they were reaching an end to their patience.</p><p>It also meant they couldn&#x2019;t overstretch themselves. &#xA0;It was preferable to waste one or two day in-game instead of wasting 48 hours from the Game Over. &#xA0;They were players who had bought a 20 thousand dollar system and they were paying couple hundred dollars per month on the game. They knew which scenario was more profitable.</p><p>Still, they couldn&#x2019;t help, but be filled with regret.</p><p>&#x201C;We should have just given the money to the Hahoe Mask, and we should have asked if he could carry us on his bus.&#x201D;</p><p>Their regret centered around the Hahoe Mask Hyrkan.</p><p>&#x201C;He is soloing in this place. &#xA0;I still can&#x2019;t believe it.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;I saw it with my own eyes, but I still can&#x2019;t believe it.&#x201D;</p><p>Since the Parung forest was a stage with a small number of groups, everyone knew who was operating there.</p><p>They had also developed their own community, and they helped each other when the need arose. &#xA0;Since no village was nearby, this arrangement increased their survivability. The community also allowed them to make personal connections, and it might benefit them in the future. &#xA0;At the very least, they were sharing the same hunting ground, so they were of similar levels.</p><p>This was why the Alto family had invited Hahoe Mask Hyrkan to the community, but they were coldly turned down. &#xA0;At the time, everyone thought, &#x2018;What kind of &#xA0;person is that?&#x2019;, but now they were in awe of the Hahoe Mask&#x2019;s skill.</p><p>The fact that the Alto family had to leave before they could reach level 100 made them feel a sense of loss.</p><p>&#x201C;He&#x2019;s an amazing bastard.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;It is rumored that the Hahoe Mask summons Skeleton Warriors, and one of them wields the Orc Hero&#x2019;s Sword.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;The Orc Hero&#x2019;s Sword?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;He gave a Skeleton such an expensive item? &#xA0;Is he some kind of heir to a rich family?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Ah, I&#x2019;m jealous. If only I could pay2win like the Hahoe Mask, my level would be&#x2026;.&#x201D; &#xA0;</p><p>&#x201C;Hahoe Mask. &#xA0;I bet he eat steak and wine everyday. &#xA0;I bet he imports only the highest quality of coffees.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Stop it. &#xA0;I bet he is too tired of meat, so he eat caviar with a spoon like ice cream.&#x201D;</p><p>The sense of loss they felt made them think about all kinds of things. &#xA0;It happened at that moment.</p><p>&#x201C;Huh?&#x201D;</p><p>One of the user, who was listening to this rubbish conversation, suddenly stood up in place as if he had heard something.</p><p>&#x201C;The Toon Party has sent a request for a rescue.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;The Toon party?&#x201D;</p><p>Toon Party.</p><p>Like the Alto family, the Toon party were composed of members close to advancing into level 100. &#xA0;It was a 5 man party that the Alto family had gotten acquainted with around a fortnight ago.</p><p>&#x201C;It seems we are the closest to them. &#xA0;What should we do?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;We aren&#x2019;t complete strangers with the Toon party. &#xA0;They helped us out before. &#xA0;We have to leave anyways, so let&#x2019;s help them then leave. &#xA0;Also, isn&#x2019;t the Toon party more powerful than us? &#xA0;Shouldn&#x2019;t they have no problem in taking care of couple Black Trolls?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Did they find the Red Eye?&#x201D;</p><p>At the question, the man used voice talk to have a brief conversation, then he answered his party member&#x2019;s question.</p><p>&#x201C;It&#x2019;s an ogre, but they are saying it is an ogre wearing a helmet?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;What?&#x201D;</p><p></p></div><p></p>
