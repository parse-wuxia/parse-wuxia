<p>Chapter 180 &#x2013; Hero Slaughterer (3)</p><p><span style="">8.</span></p><p><span style="">-Did you guys hear about the news from the Highwood Forest?</span></p><p><span style="">-L. Isn&#x2019;t that the location of Hahoe Mask&#x2019;s recent hunt?</span></p><p><span style="">-L. He is still hunting inside the Highwood Forest.</span></p><p><span style="">-L. Of course, everyone is aware of that fact. &#xA0;It had been only couple weeks, since the Hahoe Mask uploaded the footage of him soloing the Wood Devil!</span></p><p><span style="">-L. No, he isn&apos;t hunting monsters anymore. &#xA0;He is hunting down Big Smiles guild members.</span></p><p><span style="">These people enjoyed watching Warlord. &#xA0;They were also interested in the User named the Hahoe Mask. &#xA0;He made their hearts flutter from excitement. &#xA0;They were very interested in the activities of the Hahoe Mask, since he attempted tasks that was considered to be impossible to solo. &#xA0;They cheered when he overcame the odds.</span></p><p><span style="">He was able to solo Boss Monster Raids, and he was doing the Main Scenario Quest by himself. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">Moreover, he was able to oppose the 30 great guilds. &#xA0;These exalted organizations were almost untouchable as if they were placed high in the sky, and even the influential Underfoot guilds could do nothing against them. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">This made people become more fanatical about the Hahoe Mask.</span></p><p><span style="">These people were romantics.</span></p><p><span style="">Everyone could imagine themselves doing what the Hahoe Mask did. &#xA0;While anyone could imagine doing it, the Hahoe Mask actually took action to make these ideas into reality.</span></p><p><span style="">This inflamed the romanticism inside the hearts of people.</span></p><p><span style="">-Did he declare war against the Big Smiles guild?</span></p><p><span style="">-L No. &#xA0;He says he is out for revenge.</span></p><p><span style="">-L- Revenge? Against whom?</span></p><p><span style="">-L. Pitbull and the Hahoe Mask are friends. &#xA0;Recently, the Big Smiles guild killed Pitbull. &#xA0;He is avenging Pitbull.</span></p><p><span style="">-L. From what I heard, the Hahoe Mask didn&#x2019;t touch anyone except the 10 guild members, who hunted down Pitbull. &#xA0;He even apologized to the unrelated party members for intruding on the hunt.</span></p><p><span style="">This was the most important part of his plan. &#xA0;Ahn-jaehyun had to sidestep the trappings of the romanticism his actions might evoke.</span></p><p><span style="">&apos;I like where the public opinions are heading.&apos;</span></p><p><span style="">He sipped his coffee, and he looked at the reaction caused by his actions. &#xA0;Ahn-jaehyun was satisfied.</span></p><p><span style="">&apos;Yes, this is the correct answer.&apos;</span></p><p><span style="">The act of fighting the 30 great guilds had a quality of romanticism. &#xA0;Everyone could imagine doing it, yet no one could do it. &#xA0;Of course, even the Hahoe Mask couldn&#x2019;t fight the 30 great guilds in a fair fight.</span></p><p><span style="">Before he had returned to the past, he had felt this truth deep within his bones. &#xA0;He had made enemies of the Stormhunters guild, and this had turned the entirety of the 30 great guilds against him. &#xA0;He had fought them like a crazed dog. &#xA0;However, he now realized how illogical and pointless such an act was.</span></p><p><span style="">This was especially true for Ahn-jaehyun, since it didn&#x2019;t make sense to cause a Game Over to all of his opponents, because they were wearing the same uniforms. &#xA0;It was a dangerous way to play this game, and it was also stupid.</span></p><p><span style="">&apos;Nothing good will come from messing with the normal guild members.&apos;</span></p><p><span style="">Before he returned to the past, he had been very radical in his actions as the Hero Slaughterer. &#xA0;He cut down anyone that got in his way. &#xA0;This was why he was nicknamed the Slaughterer. &#xA0;He never hesitated, and he had no mercy.</span></p><p><span style="">If he looked backed on it, he knew it had been a mistake. &#xA0;It didn&#x2019;t matter how or why he killed the Users, but in the end, they were revived from their Game Over after 48 hours. &#xA0;They would be made whole again, and their animosity towards him would grow.</span></p><p><span style="">Basically, the hatred mounted and the number of Users he wronged increased to a point where they took action by attacking the Hero Slaughterer..</span></p><p><span style="">In truth, when the Stormhunters guild announced their war against the Hero Slaughterer Hyrkan, not everyone was willing to follow their lead. &#xA0;The normal guild members hated being dragged into such conflicts. &#xA0;There was no reason why they would enjoy it. &#xA0;It wasn&#x2019;t as if killing a single User allowed them to gain treasures. &#xA0;Moreover, if they weren&#x2019;t careful, there was a high risk that they would suffer a Game Over. &#xA0;The normal guild members were basically being forced into the hunt, so why would they like such a scenario?</span></p><p><span style="">However, once those normal guild members died at the hands of the Hero Slaughterer, their eyes flipped over from anger. &#xA0;Even if they weren&#x2019;t told to catch Hyrkan, they threw their bodies towards him.</span></p><p><span style="">It would be difficult to convince the first wave of Users to throw their bodies against him. &#xA0;However, it wouldn&#x2019;t be too hard to convince the second and third wave of Users.</span></p><p><span style="">Ahn-jaehyun applied the lesson he had learned to his current actions.</span></p><p><span style="">&apos;It is unnecessary to galvanize the regular guild members.&apos;</span></p><p><span style="">His targets had to precise.</span></p><p><span style="">The Hahoe Mask left alone the Users, who had nothing to do with the attack on Pibtbull. &#xA0;He only attacked the guilty, since they wouldn&#x2019;t be able to complain even if they were killed.</span></p><p><span style="">Of course, none of the Big Smiles guild members would clap their hands at the Hahoe Mask&#x2019;s actions. &#xA0;They wouldn&#x2019;t be happy, but it would make them think. &#xA0;It would make them wonder if it was worth messing with the Hahoe Mask.</span></p><p><span style="">This was why&#x2026;.</span></p><p><span style="">&apos;The Big Smiles guild officers will now gather to come up with a plan.&apos;</span></p><p><span style="">The normal guild members will now want the higher ups to take care of the problem!</span></p><p><span style="">The normal guild members would choose to remain as spectators.</span></p><p><span style="">This was why the Hahoe Mask expressed to the normal guild members that he wasn&#x2019;t the enemy. &#xA0;He even saved some, who were in trouble.</span></p><p><span style="">He used numerous methods. &#xA0;He sometimes killed his target, and he retreated quickly. &#xA0;He purposefully approached a Big Smiles guild party without any of his targets included within the group, and he struck up amicable conversations with them. &#xA0;He even gave them permission to contact him, and he gave encouraging words to the hunt parties. &#xA0;&#xA0;From the perspective of the guild members, the Hahoe Mask&#x2019;s words were far from sounding friendly, but they felt relieved from not being PKed. &#xA0;There were even times when the Hahoe Mask had saved a Big Smiles guild member in trouble during a hunt. &#xA0;He also gave them tips on how to more effectively hunt down the Wood Devils.</span></p><p><span style="">Everyone knew he wasn&#x2019;t doing this out of pure kindness, but they were thoroughly convinced that the Hahoe Mask would only attack his targets.</span></p><p><span style="">&apos;In the past, this method wouldn&#x2019;t have worked.&apos;</span></p><p><span style="">Of course, if the Hahoe Mask was someone insignificant, this would be a different story. &#xA0;Every one of them would have attacked him on sight. &#xA0;However, the Hahoe Mask was no longer a User that could be taken down by a single party.</span></p><p><span style="">This was the difference between the prior Hero Slaughterer Hyrkan, and the current Hahoe Mask.</span></p><p><span style="">He needed the current level of power to pull off this plan.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Hmmm.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">He had enough power now. &#xA0;He was able to leisurely smell the coffee as he hummed a tune even as he faced an enemy called the 30 great guilds.</span></p><p><span style="">&apos;If I chase their tail like this, the Big Smile guild&#x2019;s reputation will suffer. &#xA0;They&#x2019;ll try to catch me&#x2026; &#xA0;I would be very grateful if they chose to catch me using a bait and a small force.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">The power he possessed gave him the luxury to be able to think a move ahead.</span></p><p><span style="">This required power, and the current Ahn-jaehyun possessed that power.</span></p><p><span style="">9.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;What did you just say?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;We&#x2019;ve received information saying the Hahoe Mask had appeared within the Highwood Forest again. &#xA0;I think it would be best to take a break today.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;What are you talking about? You want to take a break?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;The current situation is a bit muddled right now.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">The speaker, Jigwan, was a Level 235 member of the Big Smiles guild. &#xA0;He was a Ranked User, who operated while maintaining the very high level. &#xA0;This was why he was flabbergasted by his comrade&#x2019;s words.</span></p><p><span style="">As he maintained this dumbfounded look, he lightly swiveled his head to look at the atmosphere of his surrounding. &#xA0;His party members had finished getting ready for the battle with the Wood Devil. &#xA0;Some refused to meet his eyes, but others boldly met his eyes. &#xA0;However, all of them were in disagreement with him.</span></p><p><span style="">This was why he quickly realized what was going on, so Jigwan gritted his teeth.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;You guys&#x2026;.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;We aren&#x2019;t saying you did anything wrong. &#xA0;You did good. &#xA0;We are almost thankful that you took the initiative. &#xA0;You went through with it. &#xA0;At the very least, we won&#x2019;t be called cowards by others before we go into battle thanks to you.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Jigwan had been about to erupt in rage, but his comrade shut him up by talking over him.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;No&#x2026;&#x2026;&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;However, if a problem arises here, it&#x2019;ll be a detriment to you.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">It seemed his comrade was determined to speak his mind. &#xA0;It was as if he had prepared a speech for this eventuality, so he poured out his words towards Jigwan.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;It isn&#x2019;t as if the high ranking people will do anything for you. &#xA0;It isn&#x2019;t as if they are ordering us to form a hunting party to catch the Hahoe Mask. &#xA0;If you act too hastily, you are the only one, who will suffer.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Hey!&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">The power of his rapid-fire words were very effective. &#xA0;Jigwan was made momentarily speechless. </span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I&#x2019;m sorry.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">At the short phrase, Jigwan shut his mouth as if a key had been turned.</span></p><p><span style="">Jigwan could no longer raise his voice. &#xA0;His party member&#x2019;s words made Jigwan realize the underlying reasons behind the other User&#x2019;s words.</span></p><p><span style="">&apos;Shit.&apos;</span></p><p><span style="">This made Jigwan more angry.</span></p><p><span style="">It was so clear that he would have to accept the current reality.</span></p><p><span style="">&apos;What did I do wrong!&apos;</span></p><p><span style="">His anger turned towards the Hahoe Mask.</span></p><p><span style="">&apos;That damn bastard. &#xA0;It is all the Hahoe Mask&#x2019;s fault&#x2026;.&apos;</span></p><p><span style="">At the same time, his anger moved on from the Hahoe Mask to a different existence.</span></p><p><span style="">&apos;Why are we so afraid of a single person? &#xA0;Why do I have to suffer like this, because of their cowardice?&apos;</span></p><p><span style="">He focused his anger on the executive officers, who lead the Big Smiles guild.</span></p><p><span style="">&apos;I&#x2019;ve worked my butt off for the Big Smiles.&apos;</span></p><p><span style="">From the birth of the game of Warlord, he had gotten close to the members of this guild. &#xA0;They were so close that they called each other hyung and dongsaeng. &#xA0;His relationship with the other guild members spanned across a good amount of time, and this was why the betrayal hurt so much.</span></p><p><span style="">Jigwan wasn&#x2019;t someone that would stand being treated so poorly. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">This was especially true, since his actions were all for the benefit of the Big Smiles guild.</span></p><p><span style="">At that moment, he thought about the last time he was treated right.</span></p><p><span style="">&apos;This would have never happened when Heh-bibin was in charge of the guild.&apos;</span></p><p><span style="">In the past, their guild didn&#x2019;t have a guild master. &#xA0;The executive officers ran the guild. &#xA0;At the time, Heh-bibin had wielded a considerable amount of power within the guild.</span></p><p><span style="">During that time, Jigwan had been treated very well. &#xA0;He was always given full support, and the small problems were taken care of by the guild. &#xA0;The guild didn&#x2019;t even ask any questions when taking care of the problem.</span></p><p><span style="">Heh-bibin also gave breaks to Users tired from leveling up by purposefully putting them in youtube videos or a live broadcast. &#xA0;This resulted in them gaining some spending money from the appearance fee.</span></p><p><span style="">At the very least, he wouldn&#x2019;t have been treated like a leper, because he had done something that needed to be done.</span></p><p><span style="">He wasn&#x2019;t the only one,who felt this way. &#xA0;There was a significant number of members, who shared his view.</span></p><p><span style="">This was the reason why they supported Heh-bibin.</span></p><p><span style="">&apos;Heh-bibin is right. &#xA0;He is right about all of this.&apos;</span></p><p><span style="">This was the reason why they put their power behind Heh-bibin&#x2019;s ideas.</span></p><p><span style="">10.</span></p><p><span style="">When he heard Pitbull had been killed, Sinclair contacted the Hydra guild first. &#xA0;If things went sideways here, he knew his life would get very complicated.</span></p><p><span style="">This was why Sinclair sent the Hydra guild a proposal. </span></p><p><span style="">He wanted to resolve the current situation through war of words. &#xA0;They could argue over who was in the wrong through words. &#xA0;He suggested that they shouldn&#x2019;t worsen the current atmosphere by settling this through armed conflicts.</span></p><p><span style="">At the time, the tone of the conversation hadn&#x2019;t been too bad. &#xA0;Unlike Sinclair&#x2019;s worries, the Hydra guild didn&#x2019;t seem inclined to fight them head on. &#xA0;They were about to bury this incident in a quiet manner.</span></p><p><span style="">Sinclair was sure this had all been quietly resolved..</span></p><p><span style="">&apos;Hahoe Mask. &#xA0;That damn bastard&#x2026;.:</span></p><p><span style="">Everything turned into a mess when the Hahoe Mask made his appearance.</span></p><p><span style="">The Hahoe Mask started to avenge his friend&#x2019;s death.</span></p><p><span style="">&apos;That little bastard. &#xA0;I never expected him to act this way.&apos;</span></p><p><span style="">The Hahoe Mask used a method he had never used before. &#xA0;He only eliminated his targets. &#xA0;He worked in an arrogant manner, and he avenged his friend in a way that was only possible for the Hahoe Mask.</span></p><p><span style="">The method used by the Hahoe Mask turned out to be more troublesome than expected. &#xA0;If the Hahoe Mask waged a war against the entirety of the Big Smiles guild, Sinclair would have used this opportunity to declare war on the Hahoe Mask.</span></p><p><span style="">Sinclair had always wanted to kill the Hahoe Mask. &#xA0;If he attacked out of his own volition, Sinclair would have been thankful.</span></p><p><span style="">However, he hadn&#x2019;t done that. &#xA0;The Hahoe Mask made this into a personal revenge play.</span></p><p><span style="">This was now a private matter between Users. &#xA0;If a 30 great guild stepped forward to interfere, the fallout would be huge. &#xA0;This was the biggest problem they would face. &#xA0;If they were to kill the Hahoe Mask, they would have to put up with the big fall out. &#xA0;When the potential for loss was this large, no one dared to act in a rash manner.</span></p><p><span style="">This was why the meeting of the officers was called into order.</span></p><p><span style="">However, another problem arose at this point in time.</span></p><p><span style="">Sinclair was excluded from the meeting of the officers.</span></p><p><span style="">&apos;Heh-bibin&#x2026;&#x2026; &#xA0;I&#x2019;m sure that bastard planned this.&apos;</span></p><p><span style="">First, Sinclair wasn&#x2019;t officially an executive officer. &#xA0;It was true that he was the best ace inside the Big Smiles guild. &#xA0;However, by definition, the guild master, and the two sub-guild masters were considered to be the executive officers. </span></p><p><span style="">Right now Sinclair had no choice, but to wake up to what was going on. &#xA0;This incident had the fingerprints of Heh-bibin all over it.</span></p><p><span style="">Heh-bibin had been treated like a useless sack of wheat until now, but it seemed Heh-bibin had found a way to amplify his voice.</span></p><p><span style="">Heh-bibin&#x2019;s voice was strengthened by the opinions of the regular guild members. &#xA0;Heh-bibin hadn&#x2019;t been overt about his actions. &#xA0;He had been a huge advocate for those guild members, who had killed the Pitbull. &#xA0;Heh-bibin spoke numerous times about the guild needing to protect these guild members.</span></p><p><span style="">Everyone, who hunted Pitbull, probably stood on Heh-bibin&#x2019;s side. &#xA0;On top of it all, the users operating within the Highwood Forest would also side with Heh-bibin. &#xA0;These were high level Users, who were over level 230. &#xA0;They were the main fighting power of the Big Smiles guild.</span></p><p><span style="">&apos;The machination being played by Heh-bibin is no joke.&apos;</span></p><p><span style="">If one thought about it, Heh-bibin&#x2019;s actions were chilling, amazing and a bit ridiculous.</span></p><p><span style="">This was only a game. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">Why would he do such an act over a game?</span></p><p><span style="">This thought brushed by Sinclair&#x2019;s mind. &#xA0;Of course, Sinclair immediately rejected such notions.</span></p><p><span style="">&apos;This game wasn&#x2019;t a joke from the start.&apos;</span></p><p><span style="">Warlord wasn&#x2019;t a simple game. &#xA0;The makers of this game and the people, who played this game, invested excessive amount of assets into Warlord. &#xA0;Too many things were shoved into this game.</span></p><p><span style="">This game was supposed to be run and managed by the AI, but now it had become a completely different game.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Tsk.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">He clicked his tongue, and Sinclair organized the complicated thoughts inside his head. &#xA0;He simplified the situation.</span></p><p><span style="">&apos;If we choose to catch the Hahoe Mask, we have to go all in. &#xA0;If we decide not to catch him, we have to be bold in our negotiations with him. &#xA0;&#xA0;If we put together a half-assed team of 100 guild members to hunt him down&#x2026;.&apos;</span></p><p><span style="">He hoped the meeting of officers would avoid choosing the worst option.</span></p><p><span style="">The meeting of the officers came to an end.</span></p><p><span style="">11.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Brooks. &#xA0;Why are you agreeing to such a ridiculous proposal?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">When the results of the meeting was declared, Sinclair spoke in an accusatory tone towards Brooks.</span></p><p><span style="">-Both Apollo and Heh-bibin made a fuss, so what can I do? </span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Apollo? &#xA0;What are you talking about?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">-Apollo is supporting Heh-bibin&#x2019;s decision. &#xA0;If I have to oppose two sub-guildmasters, I need a good reason.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;The reason&#x2026;&#x2026;</span></p><p><span style="">-Are you saying we should accept the death of the eleven members, who participated in the Pitbull hunt? &#xA0;We can&#x2019;t give everything to the Hahoe Mask. &#xA0;What would happen to my name? &#xA0;The normal guild members are treating the Users, who attacked Pitbull, like heroes.</span></p><p><span style="">At the mention of heroes, Sinclair snorted.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;They aren&#x2019;t heroes. &#xA0;Does that mean the Hahoe Mask is the Hero Slaughterer, since he killed them?</span></p><p><span style="">- Heh-bibin maneuvered to bring this about. &#xA0;In truth, I can&#x2019;t do anything about it now. &#xA0;We have to put this to rest by killing the Hahoe mask.</span></p><p><span style="">Sinclair barely kept himself from snorting again.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;We are going to kill the Hahoe Mask? &#xA0;How are we going to do that? &#xA0;Do you really think you&#x2019;ll be able to kill him with only 100 Users?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">-This is different. &#xA0;We have 11 surefire baits that will net the Hahoe Mask.</span></p><p><span style="">Sinclair had a thought when he heard those words.</span></p><p><span style="">&apos;They succeeded in convincing Brooks.&apos;</span></p><p><span style="">Brooks was trying to convince him, and Sinclair knew he wouldn&#x2019;t be able to talk Brooks out of this.</span></p><p><span style="">In the end, Heh-bibin had been successful in his plot. &#xA0;He pulled Apollo to his side, and he had convinced Brooks.</span></p><p><span style="">What would happen next?</span></p><p><span style="">Heh-bibin will push himself to the fore again.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Anyways, I&#x2019;ll have nothing to do with this venture.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">-If the Killer doesn&#x2019;t join, there will be a lot of talk.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;It would be worse to fail with me included in the hunt. &#xA0;You should leave me out, so there will be an excuse if you guys fail.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">-Do you really think we will fail?</span></p><p><span style="">Sinclair knew Heh-bibin wouldn&#x2019;t be satisfied with his victory. &#xA0;When one succeeds in turning the table, one wants something more than just turning the tables. &#xA0;Heh-bibin will try to create a situation where others cannot turn the tables against him.</span></p><p><span style="">Then what?</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;From Heh-bibin&#x2019;s perspective, he has nothing to gain from the plan succeeding. &#xA0;Please use your head, Brooks.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">In the end, the buck stopped with the guild master. &#xA0;Brooks would bear the responsibility of all actions taken by the guild.</span></p><p><span style="">-You really think of me as an idiot. &#xA0;I brought about a war with Triple Wings alongside the Hands guild, yet you treat me like this.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I spoke too harshly. &#xA0;I apologize.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">-No, you don&#x2019;t have to apologize.</span></p><p><span style="">The conversation ended there.</span></p><p><span style="">Eleven Users were facing a Wood Devil. &#xA0;It was quite common to come across the sight of a party hunting down a Wood Devil. &#xA0;However, this party&#x2019;s composition was very unique. &#xA0;Seven of the 11 Users were Strikers.</span></p><p><span style="">Of course, a Wood Devil Raid needed a high number of Swordsman class Users, but seven Strikers was most definitely a unique composition.</span></p><p><span style="">Maybe this was the reason why the Wood Devil hunt wasn&#x2019;t going well.</span></p><p><span style="">Moreover, a good number of Users were having a hard time focusing on the Wood Devil hunt.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;What about the Hahoe Mask?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I don&#x2019;t see him yet.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Be on your guard, but let&#x2019;s focus on the hunt.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Be careful! &#xA0;If we are killed by the Wood Devil, this was all for naught!&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Their conversations was the proof.</span></p><p><span style="">In reality, they weren&#x2019;t gathered here to hunt the Wood Devil.</span></p><p><span style="">They were bait.</span></p><p><span style="">After the meeting of the officers, the decision was handed down to the troops. &#xA0;They had decided to hunt down the Hahoe Mask. &#xA0;This was why this hunting team was formed. &#xA0;This team would simultaneously be a bait and a weapon pointed towards the Hahoe Mask.</span></p><p><span style="">The plan was simple. &#xA0;If the bait was taken, the Hahoe Mask hunting team would move in. &#xA0;If the bait was left alone, they&#x2019;ll announce that the Hahoe Mask&#x2019;s absence meant he was conceding defeat.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I hope the Hahoe Mask shows up today&#x2026;.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">The seven Users, who were placed into the party as bait, waited for the appearance of the Hahoe Mask. &#xA0;They were confident in this plan. &#xA0;If there had been no preparations, it would be very difficult to kill the Hahoe Mask. &#xA0;However, they had made thorough preparations for the appearance of the Hahoe Mask, and they really believed they would be able to take him down.</span></p><p><span style="">Shweee!</span></p><p><span style="">Two Wyverns appeared above their heads. </span></p><p><span style="">Hwah-roo-roo!</span></p><p><span style="">One Wyvern was made out of flame, and the other was made out of bones. &#xA0;It was the Wyvern Fire Golem and the Bone Wyvern. &#xA0;The two Wyverns dove downwards, and it was a scary sight. &#xA0;However, the eleven Users welcomed the appearance of the two Wyverns.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;It&#x2019;s the Hahoe Mask!&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;He is finally here!&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Be careful&#xFF01;&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;If needed, just disengage and run away from the Wood Devil!&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Two Wyverns landed on the ground. &#xA0;However, that was all they did. &#xA0;The two Wyverns just &#xA0;looked at the eleven Users, who were battling the Wood Devil.</span></p><p><span style="">&apos;Huh?&apos;</span></p><p><span style="">&apos;What the hell?&apos;</span></p><p><span style="">They had expected a terrifying offensive attacks, and this unexpected situation made the eleven Users flustered.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;What&#x2019;s going on?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Should we run away?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">They were still battling the Wood Devil, and the Users were unable to assess the situation. &#xA0;They were asking for an answer.</span></p><p><span style="">However, the one to give the answer wasn&#x2019;t one of their comrades.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Ah. &#xA0;You guys are all gathered here. &#xA0;Hello.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Hahoe Mask made his appearance as he gave his greeting. &#xA0;He cleared his throat then he paused before taking out a paper. &#xA0;The paper held the drawing of a Pitbull Terrier&#x2019;s face.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;This is my friend. &#xA0;He said my act of revenge serves no purpose. &#xA0;He said he forgives you all. &#xA0;I came here to tell you that. &#xA0;Have fun with your hunt. &#xA0;I hope you received a good drop.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan turned his back after speaking, and he left the battlefield with the Bone Wyvern and the Fire Golem in tow. &#xA0;He headed towards the north.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;W...What the fuck?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">This was too unexpected. &#xA0;In such a situation, the announcement from the Voice Talk broke them out from their stupor.</span></p><p><span style="">-Hahoe Mask is going north.</span></p><p><span style="">-The bait team will retreat to the back.</span></p><p><span style="">-The Hahoe Mask hunt team has to take down the Hahoe Mask at all cost. &#xA0;Use all methods available to you.</span></p><p><span style="">The Hahoe Mask hunt team started to move.</span></p><p><span style="">&apos;Ah, wait a moment.&apos;</span></p><p><span style="">&apos;Hahoe Mask is&#x2026;&#x2026;:</span></p><p><span style="">In such an urgent and unexpected situation, none in the bait team was able to comprehend what had just happened.</span></p>
