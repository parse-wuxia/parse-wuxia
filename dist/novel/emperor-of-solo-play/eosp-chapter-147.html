<p>Chapter 147 - Frost Knight (3)</p><p>5.</p><p><span style="">The Main Scenario Quest was the most important main content in Warlord. &#xA0;This was why there was a clear demarcation on when it starts and ends. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">This was why the updates regarding the Main Scenario quest had been put on the System-wide Announcement. &#xA0;It updated the Users of the start and end to the Main Scenario Quest.</span></p><p><span style="">It had notified everyone of the start and end of the Corrupt Count episode.</span></p><p><span style="">Then it notified everyone of the start and end to the Immoral Prince episode.</span></p><p><span style="">At that moment, the 5th such Announcement had been sent out, and it shook the foundation of Warlord.</span></p><p><span style="">Of course, any news regarding Warlord shook the online world.</span></p><p><span style="">- The third Main Scenario Quest has just started! </span></p><p><span style="">- Finally, it begins! </span></p><p><span style="">- Is the 2nd Advancement going to be released?</span></p><p><span style="">- Something seems a bit off this time.</span></p><p><span style="">This Main Scenario Quest was different from the ones before. &#xA0;The game had been clear in spreading the name of the User that had opened up this new era.</span></p><p><span style="">- So who the hell is Hyrkan? &#xA0;Which 30 great guild is he in?</span></p><p><span style="">His name was Hyrkan.</span></p><p><span style="">- &#x3134; You dolt! &#xA0;That&apos;s the Hahoe Mask&apos;s character name!</span></p><p><span style="">- &#x3134; Uh? &#xA0;The Hahoe Mask was named Hyrkan?</span></p><p><span style="">- &#x3134; The Hahoe Mask&apos;s name isn&apos;t the Hahoe Mask? </span></p><p><span style="">- &#x3134; Wasn&apos;t it Huh-Maeung? </span></p><p><span style="">The User called the Hahoe Mask was known more by the nickname he had created than his actual character name.</span></p><p>6.</p><p><span style="">It was a small tunnel that a person could barely pass through. &#xA0;He had left behind Nero as he headed towards the decisive battle. &#xA0;As he was passing through the tunnel, Hyrkan became flustered for a moment.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;My god.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">He had become the main character that heralded the start of the Ruined Kingdom episode. &#xA0;Of course, it was something he had always wanted.</span></p><p><span style="">However, this should have occurred at the peak of the Urugal mountain. &#xA0;It shouldn&apos;t have happened right now. &#xA0;It should have happened when he caught the fire breathing Slime Dragon.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;&#x2026;&#x2026;the Frozen Kingdom and the Urugal mountain range. &#xA0;The key was placed in two locations?&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">It wasn&#x2019;t as if he didn&apos;t understand the concept behind it.</span></p><p><span style="">Originally, Warlord&apos;s Main Scenario Quest had many roads that led to a single destination. &#xA0;The event that triggered the Ruined Kingdom episode in the Urugal mountain range may have just been one of several methods one could have used. &#xA0;The probability that there were multiple trigger points rather than one was high.</span></p><p><span style="">It just meant that the Stormhunters hadn&apos;t been able to find the clue located in the Frozen Kingdom. &#xA0;In the meanwhile, someone else had succeeded in climbing the Urugal mountain range.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Shit. &#xA0;Did I perhaps change the content of the Main Scenario quest? &#xA0;It seems a lot of Quest independent of the Ruined Kingdom episode was released too.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">This hadn&apos;t been a ploy hatched by someone else. &#xA0;Hyrkan&apos;s own hands had changed the events, and he couldn&apos;t blame anyone for what happened from now on. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;This is driving me nuts.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">The Ruined Kingdom was Hyrkan&apos;s last chance. &#xA0;After the Ruined Kingdom episode, the Dragon&apos;s Army episode would start. &#xA0;He didn&apos;t have much knowledge about what would happen there. &#xA0;When the Dragon&apos;s Army episode was starting to get interesting, a grudge formed between the Hahoe Mask guild and the Stormhunters guild . &#xA0;No, it wasn&apos;t a grudge between the guilds. &#xA0;Only Hyrkan had been excised and thrown away. &#xA0;Then he was crushed without mercy.</span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan shut his mouth tight.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;I&apos;m guessing the larger framework won&#x2019;t change&#x2026;&#x2026;.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">For the first time, he checked the exact content of the Quest given to him by Nero.</span></p><p><span style="">The Quest Window formed inside the dark space.</span></p><p><span style="">[Kingdom&apos;s Revenge] </span></p><p><span style="">- Quest Rank : Epic</span></p><p><span style="">- Quest level Range : Over 195</span></p><p><span style="">- Quest Content : To save the the beings suffering under the Frost Dragon&apos;s curse, defeat the Frost Knight.</span></p><p><span style="">- Quest Reward : Ancient Power &#x2018;Frost&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">At that moment, Hyrkan&apos;s mishap came to a pause. &#xA0;He stopped walking. &#xA0;Until now, this was the most forceful stop he had taken.</span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan stood there for over one minute. </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Frost?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">As he stood still, a short word came out of Hyrkan&apos;s mouth.</span></p><p><span style="">Eventually, he repeated the short word.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Frost!&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Since he started Warlord, Hyrkan uttered the strongest exclamation he had ever spoken.</span></p><p>7.</p><p><span style="">Ancient Power.</span></p><p><span style="">It was the core content that permeated the Ruined Kingdom episode. &#xA0;It was judged to be the greatest content in the Ruined Kingdom episode. &#xA0;It was the crux of the Skill Enhancement System.</span></p><p><span style="">Through the Ruined Kingdom episode, the Users would be able to find relics of the Ruined Kingdom, which was crumbling away... &#xA0;One could find traces of castles, dungeons and the hidden mysteries. &#xA0;One would be able to gain the Ancient Power through various quests.</span></p><p><span style="">Moreover, there were different ranks to the Ancient Power one could obtain.</span></p><p><span style="">There was the Transcendent Rank that would allow one to strengthen the rank of a Skill.</span></p><p><span style="">There was the Legend Rank, which added a special ability to the Skill.</span></p><p><span style="">Then there was the Mythos Rank where a Class ability was added.</span></p><p><span style="">Amongst these three, the Transcendent Rank was the least difficult to obtain. &#xA0;It was something the light Users would be able to gain.</span></p><p><span style="">The Legend Rank would need a good amount of work to obtain for the light Users, but if one was dedicated, it could be earned.</span></p><p><span style="">However, the Mytho Rank was impossible to get through will and determination. &#xA0;Basically, it wasn&apos;t a content for the light Users. &#xA0;This was a content for those that consumed the game too fast... &#xA0;From the game&apos;s perspective, it was for the Users that disgusted the game developers. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">It was a basically a content that said, &apos;Let&apos;s see if you bastards can beat this!&apos;</span></p><p><span style="">The problem wasn&apos;t that it was simply difficult. &#xA0;It was complex. &#xA0;One had to discover various Quests, and one had to complete it all. &#xA0;One had to travel to various location in this vast world of Warlord, and one had to gather Ingredients that could only be obtained by the User. </span></p><p><span style="">Moreover, no one had attempted it yet, so Hyrkan would be a pioneer. &#xA0;As expected of someone, who had opened up this new era, he would be achieving these accomplishments first! </span></p><p><span style="">This was the reason why he was doing all of this.</span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan didn&apos;t have to worry about coexisting with anyone else in the Ruined Kingdom Episode. &#xA0;He didn&apos;t even keep the idea of coexistence inside his mind. &#xA0;This was the reason why he had insisted on a monopoly.</span></p><p><span style="">If he went through the standard procedure, he would have to give up leveling up for two to three months to earn the Mythos Rank power. &#xA0;He would have to focus solely on the quests. &#xA0;However, the Ruined Kingdom episode of the Main Scenario Quest gave the Mythos Rank Ancient Power through the Quest Reward. &#xA0;Of course, there was a caveat that it was only a reward if he was able to get the Quest Reward before all the other Users in Warlord.</span></p><p><span style="">Moreover, Hyrkan knew of 5 types of Mythos Rank Ancient Power.</span></p><p><span style="">Frost, Flame, Thunder, Darkness and Radiance. </span></p><p><span style="">When Hyrkan developed a profound interest for the game, this was the extent of information that had been made available to him. &#xA0;At the time, there were only two hundred Users that possessed all 5 Mythos Ranked Ancient Power. &#xA0;It wasn&apos;t a lot of people. &#xA0;It was one year after the Ruined Kingdom and the Skill Enhancement system had been released, yet only two hundred Users had gained the power in a population of millions. &#xA0;Moreover, only two hundred people had it amongst the people, who had dedicated their lives to this game. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">Of course, Hyrkan hadn&apos;t been one of them. &#xA0;He couldn&apos;t even dream about obtaining it.</span></p><p><span style="">However, Hyrkan had the chance to obtain one of this Ancient Power right now.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;This is weird. &#xA0;The Ancient Power reward for climbing to the top of the Urugal mountain was a Legendary Rank.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">It was his chance to to obtain the Ancient Power of Frost.</span></p><p><span style="">It was a surprising opportunity, but on the other hand, he felt a very deep apprehension towards it.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;So why would the Mythos Rank suddenly show up here....&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">However, his apprehension didn&apos;t last long.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Frost&#x2026;&#x2026;.&#x2019; &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;&#x2026;wow.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">He had thought about obtaining the Mytho Rank Ancient Power. &#xA0;However, he never would have expected to obtain it this way.</span></p><p><span style="">This was why Hyrkan wasn&apos;t afraid of the change. &#xA0;This wasn&apos;t the time to be afraid of the change.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;I have to seize it.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan estimated how much time had passed.</span></p><p><span style="">He had expended more time than expected, because of Nero. &#xA0;However, he didn&apos;t need to take a break by logging out. &#xA0;On the contrary, this was the perfect time to do this.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;No matter what.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">At that moment, it was like the time he had faced the Immoral Prince and Argardo.... &#xA0;No, he found a purpose that exceeded the one he had from before. &#xA0;He had found a purpose that was worth putting everything on the line on this battle.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;I have to catch it no matter what..&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan started running after he exited the secret tunnel leading to Nero.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ooh-ha-ha-ha!&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">He headed towards the Frozen Throne where the Frost Knight ruled from!</span></p><p>8.</p><p><span style="">It was as if the throne had been carved out of an enormous ice. &#xA0;There was a knight wearing a massive armor that was made out of semi-transparent ice. &#xA0;It filled up the massive throne. &#xA0;Each decoration on its armor looked to have be sculpted by hand, and it was an extraordinary sight. &#xA0;It held the pattern of dragon scales, and it looked as if it was about to come alive. &#xA0;The helmet was reminiscent of a Dragon&apos;s horn, and one could see a pale and frozen face beneath the helmet. &#xA0;It was an ogre with frightening looking teeth.</span></p><p><span style="">Frost Knight.</span></p><p><span style="">It was in charge of maintaining the Frost Dragon&apos;s curse. &#xA0;Its enemy had arrived right in front of it, yet it didn&apos;t even bother getting up from the throne.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;This place had been judged by the being that is great yet harsh.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">It sounded ancient and grave.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;How are you dirty this place.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">It started to move slowly.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;This place had committed disrespect&#x2026;&#x2026;.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">It spoke slowly as it clearly enunciated each word.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;It will repay the transgression through eternal servitude.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">As if it had said all it had to say, the Frost Knight slowly got up from its seat. &#xA0;The process of it standing up wasn&apos;t easy, simple, or brief.</span></p><p><span style="">Zzuh-juh-juhk! </span></p><p><span style="">The Frost Knight&apos;s body had become one with the frozen throne. &#xA0;As it stood up, one could hear the sound of ice shattering. &#xA0;One could even see cracks form on the throne. &#xA0;How long had it sat there frozen to the throne? &#xA0;It made one wonder if the Frost Knight had never gotten up even once after taking seat.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;The bastard talks too much.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">At that moment, Hyrkan faced the Frost Knight. &#xA0;At that moment he had to defeat it, so the small details didn&apos;t register in his eyes.</span></p><p><span style="">In the first place, Hyrkan didn&apos;t hold the Frost Knight in any reverence. &#xA0;He had entered the newly liberated region ruled by the Frost Knight with a do or die attitude.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I want those laughable cursed beings to wake up.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan said those determined words inside his head. &#xA0;He was more coldly focused than any other battle he had conducted before.</span></p><p><span style="">He was at a point where he desperately needed to change. &#xA0;However, he couldn&apos;t half-ass it through fear. &#xA0;It would only be to his detriment if he worried over it. &#xA0;Thanks to the Stormhunters guild he had learned that shaking from fear would only harm himself.</span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan&#x2019;s gaze looked around his surrounding, and at the same time, he bit down on the Ifrit&#x2019;s Essence inside his mouth.</span></p><p><span style="">[Ifrit&apos;s power is seeping into your entire body.] </span></p><p><span style="">At that moment, the snow from the blizzard that had touched Hyrkan&apos;s body fell to the floor as water droplets.</span></p><p><span style="">At the same time, Hyrkan opened both his arms wide as he scattered what he had been holding in his hands. &#xA0;The Skeleton Fragments let out a dull sound as they hit the floor.</span></p><p><span style="">Ooh ooh ooh&#x2026;&#x2026;. </span></p><p><span style="">The Cursed Monsters were summoned by the Frost Knight. &#xA0;They let out a low and anguished sound as they got into formation.</span></p><p><span style="">Ddul-goo-ruhk, ddul-goo-ruhk! </span></p><p><span style="">The Skeleton Warriors summoned by Hyrkan took form, and they opened their mouths wide as they let out a silent scream towards their enemies.</span></p><p><span style="">Ddahk ddahk! </span></p><p><span style="">The declaration of war was done through Hyrkan&apos;s hand.</span></p><p><span style="">The Skeleton Warriors wearing a variety of armors started charging towards the enemies.</span></p><p><span style="">Hwah-roo-roo! </span></p><p><span style="">During all of this, the Skeleton Magicians had already formed hefty fireballs, and they threw it towards the enemies.</span></p><p><span style="">The fireballs were sent flying towards the group of Cursed Monsters.</span></p><p><span style="">Zzuh-juhk! </span></p><p><span style="">At that moment, an Ice Wall rose up from the ground to block the fireballs. &#xA0;Fire impacted on ice.</span></p><p><span style="">Kwah-gwahng!</span></p><p><span style="">Accompanying a loud sound, the fire and ice fell as it scattered across the ground. </span></p><p><span style="">Rain of Fire. &#xA0;Hail of Ice.</span></p><p><span style="">Kahng! </span></p><p><span style="">The Skeleton Warriors and the Cursed Monsters fought within this shower.</span></p><p><span style="">It was 30 against a hundred. &#xA0;If one was basing it just on numbers, the Skeleton Warriors were at a disadvantage.</span></p><p><span style="">Shweek, shweek! </span></p><p><span style="">However, the Skeleton Warriors swiftly evaded the attacks of the Cursed Monsters. &#xA0;The advantage from the fact that there were a 100 of Cursed Monsters became nullified.</span></p><p><span style="">The Skeleton Warriors had fought the Cursed Monsters for 20 days under Hyrkan&apos;s command. &#xA0;There was no way the Skeleton Warriors would lose against the Cursed Monsters.</span></p><p><span style="">He had trained them for this purpose.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;I invested 20 days for this day.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">He hadn&#x2019;t been been lax in his actions. &#xA0;He hadn&#x2019;t just been hunting to level up. &#xA0;He had trained the Skeleton Warriors up to a point where they could easily defeat the Cursed Monsters. &#xA0;In his training, he purposefully made it so that his Skeleton Warriors would have to fight a Cursed Monster in a one-on-one matchup. &#xA0;He later increased it to a 3 vs one fight. &#xA0;He purposefully allowed the Skeleton Warriors fight at a numerical disadvantage.</span></p><p><span style="">This was the solution to the first problem.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;I blocked the slaves it had cursed..&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">If he wanted to catch the Frost Knight, there were four obstacles he would have to overcome. &#xA0;This was the solution to the first problem.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;So the only thing left is.... &#xA0;I have to overcome the Frost Fog, Wall of Agony and the Frost Dragon&#x2019;s Curse.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">Since he gave a solution to one of the problems, he had to come up with three more.</span></p><p><span style="">He had the three solutions, and he was about to put those answers into motion.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Pooh-haha!&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">He felt joy from just imagining it. &#xA0;It was absurd, but he spontaneously let out a laugh. &#xA0;He didn&#x2019;t have to enjoy it through his imagination any more. &#xA0;He could &#xA0;enjoy it in reality.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What shall we do?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Half way up the Urugal mountain range.</span></p><p><span style="">Thirty Users were within a cave that had been placed midway up the mountain. &#xA0;Their expressions were stiff as they waited for something.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What do you think we should do? &#xA0;We have to catch it!&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;You should it still for a moment.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What? What did you just say to me, you traitorous bastard?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;How long are you... Whatever. &#xA0;Yes. &#xA0;I&apos;m the traitor, so I&apos;ll keep my mouth shut. &#xA0;Of course. &#xA0;I&apos;m the traitor, and I did something very wrong. &#xA0;How dare I open my mouth? &#xA0;I&apos;ll keep my impertinent mouth shut.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">They were the elite members of the Stormhunters.</span></p><p><span style="">They had attempted to fight the owner of the Urugal mountain&apos;s peak, and they had failed. &#xA0;After experiencing failure, some in the guild mustered up their courage, and they had come up here for another attempt.</span></p><p><span style="">However, at that moment, their leader Shir wasn&apos;t giving them an answer as to whether they would be attempting the Raid again.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Are you trying to pick a fight with me?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Oop oop! Oop oop! Oop opp oop!&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">It was Hatch and Hahui. &#xA0;Shir kept her mouth shut as these two acted out noisily in front of her.</span></p><p><span style="">In the end, Shir&apos;s silence bled into Hatch and Hahui. &#xA0;The heavy atmosphere descended on the group, and it started pressing down on their will to even attempt this Raid again. &#xA0;It seemed they wouldn&#x2019;t be able to look at the Urugal mountain range for a while. &#xA0;They felt the atmosphere press down on their shoulders and neck. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">It happened at that moment.</span></p><p><span style="">[The curtain to the new era has risen.]</span></p><p><span style="">[The one to open this new era is &#x2018;Hyrkan&#x2019;.] </span></p><p><span style="">The surprising news overtook them.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What the hell?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;A System-wide Announcement?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">The silence ahd bee heavy, and it had been hard to break. &#xA0;However, the silence was smashed to pieces like a sheet of glass made of sugar.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Who the hell is that?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hyrkan? &#xA0;Who is that?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">At that moment, another silence that couldn&#x2019;t be compared to the one from before started to spread.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hyrkan&#x2026;&#x2026; My god. &#xA0;Isn&apos;t that the Hahoe Mask&apos;s character name?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Accompanying the silence, everyone looked towards a single User.</span></p><p><span style="">Storm Queen Shir. </span></p><p><span style="">Currently, she was one of the few that could be compared to the Hahoe Mask in terms of skill.</span></p><p><span style="">On the other hand, Shir&apos;s gaze was focused on the one that had spoken.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;P...please speak.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Are you sure the Hahoe Mask&apos;s character name is Hyrkan?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;&#x2026;ah, yes. &#xA0;It wasn&apos;t as if he tried to hide it. &#xA0;If you look at the Hahoe Mask&apos;s early videos, he named himself as Hyrkan.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Let&apos;s go.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Hatch queried at the sudden answer given by Shir. &#xA0;As if the rest of the group agreed with Hatch&apos;s sentiment, they tilted their head in confusion. &#xA0;One could almost see a question mark form on top of their heads.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I still want to recruit the Hahoe Mask, but I don&apos;t want to hear that we are inferior to the Hahoe Mask.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Shir spoke towards them in a low voice.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I don&apos;t know about how I measure up to him, but I never thought that the Stormhunters guild was weaker than the Hahoe Mask.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">The expression on everyone&apos;s face changed at her words. &#xA0;They swallowed the silence that had descended on them, and they started to manufacture courage within themselves.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Let&apos;s try it one more time.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;There is no reason why we can&apos;t kill it.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;There is no reason why we should allow ourselves to left behind by the Hahoe Mask.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">At their words, Shir made a beautiful smile that was beyond description.</span></p><p><span style="">The Stormhunters once again decided to attempt climbing the summit of the Urugal mountain.</span></p>
