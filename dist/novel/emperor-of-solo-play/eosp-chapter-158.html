<p>Chapter 158 &#x2013; Catch or Be Caught (1)</p><p>1.</p><p><span style="">The forest didn&apos;t even have a road. &#xA0;It was filled with beautiful trees and house-sized stone pillars randomly located within the forest. &#xA0;It was incredible to see Hyrkan run through such obstacles. &#xA0;At times, he dodged the tree trunks like a snake, and he used unexpected boulders as launching pads. &#xA0;He was like a squirrel. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Shit!&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">He was awesome at running away. &#xA0;However, no one in this world like or wanted to run away.</span></p><p><span style="">In such an uncertain situation, he held the Deposed Prince&apos;s Sword with his right hand as he stayed ready for a battle that might occur at any time. &#xA0;He had tucked the box with the scrolls containing the Ancient Power on his left side. &#xA0;He basically looked like a thief running away. &#xA0;Of course, he didn&apos;t have any time to relax.</span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan was running full tilt as his expression expressed his restlessness, strain and urgency.</span></p><p><span style="">Something appeared suddenly in front of him.</span></p><p><span style="">Hwah-roo-roo-roo! </span></p><p><span style="">An enormous wall of fire suddenly appeared in front of him. &#xA0;Hyrkan reflexively stopped in front of the fire.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;I&apos;m in a hurry. &#xA0;Which bastard did this?&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">Of course, Hyrkan knew that the wall of fire had been created by a magician. &#xA0;This was why he had stopped running.</span></p><p><span style="">It was around 10 meter high, and it was 1 meter in width. &#xA0;It was too big to jump over it, but Hyrkan&apos;s superior Item Setting meant that the Fire Wall couldn&apos;t do much harm to him.</span></p><p><span style="">If he wanted to, he could just charge through it. &#xA0;However, this meant the magician, who had used the magical spell, knew this fact too. &#xA0;Basically, this fire wasn&apos;t meant to damage Hyrkan. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Fuck....&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">It was a diversion.</span></p><p><span style="">If he recklessly hurtled through the Fire Wall like an acrobat, a critical blow would come from the other side.</span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan had suffered this scenario before, so he was well aware of this tactic. &#xA0;Moreover, even if there was nothing across the Fire Wall, he had no choice, but to stop.</span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan turned to look behind him. &#xA0;Unlike the chaotic situation in front of him, it was very calm and quiet behind him. &#xA0;The only thing he could see was his own tracks.</span></p><p><span style="">However, Hyrkan could guarantee it.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;If Anugas follows the attack pattern from before, it unerringly follows its opponent, and its pursuit can&#x2019;t be shaken unless it locks onto another opponent. &#xA0;It is classified as an illusion type monster, so it wouldn&#x2019;t be strange if it appeared suddenly.&apos; </span></p><p><span style="">He had a pursuer except one couldn&#x2019;t see this pursuer with one&apos;s eyes.</span></p><p><span style="">This was why Hyrkan considered the current development to be somewhat favorable for him. &#xA0;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">Currently, a Wall of Fire had been placed in front of him, and this meant that there was at least one other User nearby.</span></p><p><span style="">He had no reason to waste his energy by striking up a conversation. &#xA0;Hyrkan tossed the box he had been carrying nearby. &#xA0;It held the Ancient Power. &#xA0;At this point in the game, it was worth a lot, but he couldn&apos;t fight, while carrying it by his side. &#xA0;He wouldn&apos;t risk his life for the sake of protecting the Ancient Power.</span></p><p><span style="">When Hyrkan&apos;s left hand was freed, he stole a handful of flame from the barrier in front of him.</span></p><p><span style="">The spark of fire took hold on Hyrkan&apos;s glove, and the spark didn&apos;t fizzle out. &#xA0;Instead, it started burning larger, and the flames surged forward. &#xA0;In the end, a giant made out of fire took shape.</span></p><p><span style="">The Fire Golem appeared! </span></p><p><span style="">When the Fire Golem appeared, it immediately absorbed the flame blocking its master&apos;s path. &#xA0;Hyrkan looked at the road in front of him. &#xA0;As expected, there was a trap that was meant to catch Hyrkan.</span></p><p><span style="">Ggoo-uh-uh! </span></p><p><span style="">There were two enormous bears made out of fire like the Fire Golem on the road, and they started running toward Hyrkan.</span></p><p><span style="">However, Hyrkan didn&apos;t step forward. &#xA0;The Fire Golem had located its enemies first, and it moved to protect its master.</span></p><p><span style="">The three Fire Creatures, which had been formed beforehand, started to fight each other. &#xA0;It was a messy fight between large monsters, and while the battle was commencing, Hyrkan scattered two Skeleton Warriors.</span></p><p><span style="">The Mini Ogre Skeleton Warriors took shape!</span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan had already confirmed that these Skeletons were genius trackers, so he gave the order.</span></p><p><span style="">Ddahk, ddahk! </span></p><p><span style="">After he flicked his fingers, Hyrkan turned to look towards his back again.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;It feels as if I&apos;m fighting with a bomb strapped to my neck.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">It was a desperately dangerous situation.</span></p><p><span style="">He had fallen into a danger that he hadn&apos;t been able to predict.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Yes. &#xA0;It&apos;s always like this for me. &#xA0;When things start to go my way, a bloody awful day is around the corner.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">On the other hand, he now felt as if he was playing Warlord.</span></p><p>2.</p><p><span style="">When facing the Hahoe Mask, one had to avoid close combat at all cost. &#xA0;Even though Hyrkan was a Necromancer, he had higher Strength Stat than most Strikers. &#xA0;He had put all his Level Up bonus into Strength, and he had managed to equip himself with the best Item setting in Warlord. &#xA0;On top of all of that, he had numerous titles that boosted his Stats further.</span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan&apos;s Items were too advantageous in a close combat.</span></p><p><span style="">Crying Sword.</span></p><p><span style="">Currently, there was no weapon in existence that could destroy weapons and defensive gears as well as the Crying Sword. &#xA0;In terms of destroying Items, it wouldn&#x2019;t be an exaggeration to say that the Crying Sword was better than the Deposed Prince&apos;s Sword.</span></p><p><span style="">Depose Prince&apos;s Sword.</span></p><p><span style="">It was unequivocally the strongest Item in existence in Warlord right now.</span></p><p><span style="">The Dark Spot set was similarly a defensive gear that boasted the highest defense.</span></p><p><span style="">This resulted in Hyrkan being a monster in terms of close combat ability.</span></p><p><span style="">So what was Hyrkan&apos;s weakness? </span></p><p><span style="">It was the powerful AOE magic. Of course, Hyrkan had incredible defense against magic, and he had high resistance to elemental magic. &#xA0;It wasn&apos;t easy to give critical damage by using a powerful AOE magic.</span></p><p><span style="">However, magic was still considered to be Hyrkan&apos;s weakness even with a lot of things going against it. &#xA0;The reason being it was the surest way to keep his Skeletons underlings, which was Hyrkan&apos;s greatest power, in check. &#xA0;Hyrkan&apos;s Skeleton underlings were also equipped with incredible Items, but they couldn&apos;t be compared to Hyrkan. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">Another deciding factor was the fact that Hyrkan&apos;s magical energy consumption increased as the number of Skeleton Warriors were increased.</span></p><p><span style="">It was true.</span></p><p><span style="">Magic was Hyrkan&apos;s achilles heel, and if one wanted to kill Hyrkan, one had to aim for this weakness.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Keep using your magic! &#xA0;You have to put him on his heel! &#xA0;Use your magic, so he can&apos;t take out his Skeletons!&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Apollo was using that strategy.</span></p><p><span style="">Of course, he wasn&apos;t carrying out the plan. &#xA0;From the beginning, Apollo stood far away from the battlefield. &#xA0;He did as he wanted, and he continuously bombarded his subordinates with orders. &#xA0;His subordinates resented him. &#xA0;Apollo never contributed in a battle, yet he had the potential to be a detriment.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;That son of a bitch. &#xA0;He should do it himself!&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Does he think using magic is easy? &#xA0;Everyone thinks Tankers are the only ones that suffer.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">Of course, the recipients of Apollo&#x2019;s words didn&apos;t feel good hearing after hearing such words.</span></p><p><span style="">They were navigating through the battlefield as they chased after the Hahoe Mask. &#xA0;It was hard to use magic in such conditions, yet Apollo kept giving orders that sounded like threats. &#xA0;It was unspeakably humiliating.</span></p><p><span style="">However, their humiliation came to an end.</span></p><p><span style="">- We&apos;ve been had! </span></p><p><span style="">Something terrible occurred not long after the battle had started. Hahoe Mask used the trajectory of the magical spells to track down and kill the magicians. &#xA0;A Striker and a Tanker was placed nearby a magician as protection. &#xA0;In truth, the only thing they could do was for the Strikers to runaway with the Magicians, while the Tankers stalled the Hahoe Mask. &#xA0;This was the only way.</span></p><p><span style="">If they failed to do that, they would let out the sad message like &apos;We&apos;ve been had!&apos; again.</span></p><p><span style="">In the end, two magicians from the group of 5 was cut down.</span></p><p><span style="">Apollo smiled when he received the report.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;He finally bit the bait!&#x2019;</span></p><p>3.</p><p><span style="">With a single strike, he cut through the robe and body of the third magician. &#xA0;The Striker, who had been guarding the magician, executed a sword strike. &#xA0;It was a top to bottom swing. &#xA0;The Striker&apos;s sword fell vertically like lightning, and it was as if the Striker wanted to destroy Hyrkan&apos;s sword.</span></p><p><span style="">Kah-ahng! </span></p><p><span style="">Of course, the sound of harsh steel exploded forth.</span></p><p><span style="">Ggee-reek, ggee-reek! </span></p><p><span style="">The two swords pushed against each other as a goosebump inducing screech was emitted.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;This bastard&#xB7;&#xB7;&#xB7;&#xB7;&#xB7;&#xB7;.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">Of course, Hyrkan immediately realized the User in front of him wasn&apos;t normal.</span></p><p><span style="">It wasn&apos;t something he had to realize, since it was obvious. &#xA0;How many Users could fight on even ground with a sword with Hyrkan without using any Skills? &#xA0;Hyrkan immediately eyed his opponent&apos;s Item Setting.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;He has the Great Battle Hero&apos;s sword. &#xA0;Is that the Golden Centipede set?&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">The Great Battle Hero&apos;s sword wasn&apos;t as good as the Deposed Prince&apos;s Sword, but it was good enough to be call a top tier weapon. </span></p><p><span style="">Moreover, the Golden Centipede set was famous. &#xA0;One could get this Unique set Item when one caught a level 180 Boss Monster called the Golden Centipede. &#xA0;It had low defense, but amongst the level 180 Items, it was best for maximizing attack. This was why it was categorized as an Extreme Attack Set.</span></p><p><span style="">Of course, it was expensive. &#xA0;Even if one had money, it was hard to acquire. &#xA0;The Golden Centipede was only found recently, and Users, who weren&apos;t interested in Items, didn&apos;t even know the existence of the Item.</span></p><p><span style="">It was at that moment....</span></p><p><span style="">[Blood Ogre&apos;s Dignity has come over your body.] </span></p><p><span style="">The System Announcement gave Hyrkan a warning.</span></p><p><span style="">Blood Ogre&apos;s Dignity.</span></p><p><span style="">It was an expression one would hear when one was exposed to the Option of the Blood Ogre set. &#xA0;Basically, it meant that someone wearing the Blood Ogre set was approaching Hyrkan! </span></p><p><span style="">Moreover, Hyrkan knew better than anyone as to the price of the Blood Ogre set.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Shall we introduce our names?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Ggee-rick, ggee-rick! </span></p><p><span style="">The blade of the two swords were interlocked as if they were kissing each other. &#xA0;The User asked a question over the sound.</span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan ignored his opponent&apos;s question, and he gave an answer instead.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Rootbeer.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">RootBeer.</span></p><p><span style="">It was a drink that was popular in North America. &#xA0;It was similar to the likes of cola and cider. &#xA0;Of course, one never forgot it once one heard it.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Are you part of the Clover unit?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Even if RootBeer&apos;s name wasn&apos;t easy to remember, he would have remember this User.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;The Hahoe Mask remembered my name. &#xA0;It doesn&apos;t feel too bad.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Clover unit. </span></p><p><span style="">Of course, Hyrkan didn&apos;t remember all of them, but he remembered the skilled Users. &#xA0;RootBeer was skilled enough to be able to pull off being the centerpiece of the Clover unit.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;This guy is no joke.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">His core role was similar to Hyrkan.</span></p><p><span style="">He was the Assault Captain. &#xA0;RootBeer stuck to a monster&apos;s body to deal damage and Armor Break. &#xA0;He was a Striker!</span></p><p><span style="">In Hyrkan&apos;s estimation, it was a wonder that such a skilled User had managed to remain anonymous. &#xA0;A User of this skill would itch to be able to make a name for himself. &#xA0;He wonder how RootBeer had kept that desire in check for so long.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;He&#x2019;s the bait.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">There was a reason why RootBeer was conversing with him. &#xA0;Of course, it was part of their plan.</span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan looked out of the corner of his eyes, and he could see other Users encircling him. &#xA0;They were slowly tightening the net. &#xA0;Moreover, the User wearing the Blood Ogre set jumped out in his sight.</span></p><p><span style="">As if RootBeer didn&#x2019;t appreciate Hyrkan looking away from him, he continued to speak.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Of course, my mood would get better if I&apos;m able to kill the Hahoe Mask.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan&apos;s lips twitched.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;If only Anugas showed up here&#xB7;&#xB7;&#xB7;&#xB7;&#xB7;&#xB7;.&#x2019; &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">In the end, he wasn&apos;t in a good situation. &#xA0;Even Hyrkan couldn&apos;t take on the Clover unit here. &#xA0;Even if he chose to face them, he would only have a chance at victory if he was the one that seized the initiative.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Please come out, Anugas-nim&#xB7;&#xB7;&#xB7;&#xB7;&#xB7;&#xB7;.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">It made Hyrkan wish for the main culprit, who had been the cause of his worry, to show up. </span></p><p><span style="">At that moment.... </span></p><p><span style="">- Uh? My magic? </span></p><p><span style="">- What&apos;s going? &#xA0;Uh? &#xA0;What happened to my magical energy? </span></p><p><span style="">- Huh? &#xA0;You too? &#xA0;My magical energy also suddenly disappeared. &#xA0;What is this? &#xA0;Is it a bug?</span></p><p><span style="">- Did the Hahoe Mask use a Skill? &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">Suddenly, disorder started to spread in the Voice Talk.</span></p><p><span style="">The big fish named the Hahoe Mask was in front of RootBeer. &#xA0;Until a moment ago, he had a confident smile on his face, but the smile disappeared from RootBeer&#x2019;s mouth.</span></p><p><span style="">He planned on ignoring the chaos, but the disturbance was too large to ignore it. &#xA0;Their voices were so loud that it distracted him.</span></p><p><span style="">Most fishermen, who was trying to reel in a big fish, became irritated when a strange sound was emitted from the surrounding.</span></p><p><span style="">RootBeer yelled with Hyrkan in front of him.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;We are still in a battle! &#xA0;Focus on the battle!&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">He had yelled towards the Voice Talk, but the sound had reached Hyrkan too. &#xA0;Hyrkan smiled at his shout.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Our magical energy was erased. &#xA0;It seems Anugas has opened his eyes. &#xA0;This will probably be the only time I&#x2019;ll be glad to see it.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes. &#xA0;You should focus hard on the battle. &#xA0;Be diligent.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">At that moment, a marvel appeared from behind Hyrkan&apos;s back.</span></p><p><span style="">Zzuh-juhk! </span></p><p><span style="">The ground suddenly split open.</span></p><p><span style="">Koohng! </span></p><p><span style="">A massive four-armed Giant appeared from between the split ground.</span></p><p><span style="">The split ground had turned into a chasm, and the giant four-armed cyclops crawled out. &#xA0;Its eye were opening slowly. &#xA0;&#xA0;It large blue eye shone brighter than a gem, and it was glaring at them.</span></p><p><span style="">[Anugas opened its eyes. It has eaten every being&#x2019;s magical energy.] </span></p><p><span style="">Anugas. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">The giant that ate souls had appeared.</span></p><p>4.</p><p><span style="">Anugas. </span></p><p><span style="">When Anugas opened its eyes, the Users within 500 meters lost all their magical energy. &#xA0;It was a special ability that was akin to being struck by lightning for the magicians and priests. &#xA0;&#xA0;However, the fact that the Strikers and Tankers had to fight Anugas was more chilling.</span></p><p><span style="">Magical energy was also important to Tankers and Strikers. &#xA0;Their Skills couldn&apos;t be used for free.</span></p><p><span style="">Moreover, the number and variety of Skills used in battle was unexpectedly large.</span></p><p><span style="">All these Skills were forcefully sealed. &#xA0;The aspect of the game they took for granted was stolen away. &#xA0;It was akin to fighting in a location without any air to breathe.</span></p><p><span style="">Did this mean Anugas&#x2019; Battle Specs were weak to balance out this special ability? &#xA0;Of course not. &#xA0;Anugas&#x2019; health and attack capability wasn&apos;t overwhelming, but it had enough Stats that was befitting its status as a mid-sized Boss Monster.</span></p><p><span style="">Moreover, it had four arms, so the battle method was very difficult for the Users.</span></p><p><span style="">In simplified terms, if Anugas&#x2019; two arms could grab both arms of the Users, &#xA0;the other two arms could do anything to the body of the User. &#xA0;The User that was caught couldn&#x2019;t do anything about it.</span></p><p><span style="">If the User could use a Skill, one could probably escape its grasp. &#xA0;However, it wasn&#x2019;t possible to use one&#x2019;s Skill.</span></p><p><span style="">This was why if one didn&#x2019;t have any plans or preparations for meeting Anugas, and if Anugas suddenly grabbed the arms of the User&#x2026;.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Shit! Where did such a monster come from!&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">It would be the end for the User.</span></p><p><span style="">The Clover Unit had been closing in on the Hahoe Mask, and now they were being killed by Anugas. &#xA0;The Users couldn&#x2019;t even resist, and they dimly realized the danger they were in. </span></p><p><span style="">RootBeer watch the sight as he was still interlocked with Hyrkan. &#xA0;The inside of his head became complicated.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Was the Hahoe Mask running away from this monster?&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">They could now understand why Hahoe Mask was running away so quickly. &#xA0;This monster didn&#x2019;t make an sound, and it didn&#x2019;t leave any trace. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">RootBeer would have also run away from such a monster.</span></p><p><span style="">At that moment, the Hahoe Mask also didn&#x2019;t make any sudden moves as he assessed the situation.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Did the Blood Ogre set&#x2019;s Option draw Anugas&#x2019; aggro? &#xA0;Thank you for wearing that set. &#xA0;It was quite fortunate.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">In truth, Hyrkan wasn&#x2019;t being magnanimous by not moving. &#xA0;Hyrkan didn&#x2019;t want to move unnecessarily, since he didn&#x2019;t want to become Anugas&#x2019; target again.</span></p><p><span style="">RootBeer couldn&#x2019;t read Hyrkan&#x2019;s mind, so he asked a question.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Do you know anything about that monster?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I do now about it.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan gave a careful answer. &#xA0;Currently, a chill was running up Hyrkan&#x2019;s spine. &#xA0;Anugas had appeared behind him, so of course, he wasn&#x2019;t feeling comfortable. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">In truth, it took massive effort to have this conversation. &#xA0;He was acting casual, but it felt as if he couldn&#x2019;t breathe.. </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;You led the monster to us.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I led it to you guys? &#xA0;I was running away. &#xA0;You guys are the ones that got in my path. &#xA0;It isn&apos;t as if I attacked you guys first. So who is at more fault here?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#xB7;&#xB7;&#xB7;&#xB7;&#xB7;&#xB7;do you want to catch it with us?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">At that moment, RootBeer suddenly suggested an alliance to Hyrkan.</span></p><p><span style="">RootBeer was capable of judging the situation. &#xA0;It was really important to catch the Hahoe Mask, but an unknown monster capable of eating all magic had appeared. &#xA0;This was outside the scope of his mission.</span></p><p><span style="">Of course, he didn&#x2019;t plan on really fighting the monster that had appeared in front of them. &#xA0;He had an ulterior motive.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;At the very least, we have to avoid fighting the Hahoe Mask in this situation.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">RootBeer wanted to avoid facing the Hahoe Mask and Anugas at the same time.</span></p><p><span style="">That would be the worst case scenario.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I don&#x2019;t want to?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Of course, Hyrkan knew the reason behind RootBeer&#x2019;s proposal. &#xA0;Hyrkan poured oil on the fire within RootBeer&#x2019;s heart.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I don&#x2019;t know if you saw the first video I uploaded. &#xA0;It was called the Golden Skeleton episode. &#xA0;When this concludes, you should watch it. &#xA0;You&#x2019;ll have a new appreciation for what just happened. &#xA0;Leave me a reply in the comment section.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">For reference, RootBeer had seen Hahoe Mask&#x2019;s Golden Skeleton episode. &#xA0;He had used the Golden Skeleton to fuck over the Users that had antagonized him. &#xA0;RootBeer had realized how smart and cheap the Hahoe Mask was through that video.</span></p><p><span style="">In a flash, RootBeer came to a decision.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;I&#x2019;ll take out the Hahoe Mask with me.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">Since he couldn&apos;t choose the best case scenario, he chose the lesser evil instead of the worst case scenario! </span></p><p><span style="">In a flash, RootBeer decided to take down the Hahoe Mask with him. &#xA0;He&#x2019;ll damage the Hahoe Mask, and they&#x2019;ll both die by the hands of Anugas.</span></p><p><span style="">Kah-ahng! </span></p><p><span style="">After coming to a resolution, RootBeer broke the stalemate. &#xA0;He pushed Hyrkan&#x2019;s sword away from its interlocked position. &#xA0;When he was given a brief moment to swing his sword freely, RootBeer immediately raised his sword high.</span></p><p><span style="">It was a large movement, so naturally, there was a big hole in his defense.</span></p><p><span style="">In exchanged for opening up his defense, RootBeer planned on striking Hyrkan with a powerful blow. &#xA0;He was aiming to damage Hyrkan.</span></p><p><span style="">He planned on giving his bone to take the other&#x2019;s bone! </span></p><p><span style="">He planned on dragging this down into a dogfight. &#xA0;He planned on wounding Hyrkan.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Huh?&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">When he was about to bring down his sword, Hyrkan wasn&#x2019;t in RootBeer&#x2019;s field of vision.</span></p><p><span style="">When RootBeer raised his sword, Hyrkan hadn&#x2019;t show any signs of defending or counter-attacking the attack. &#xA0;&#xA0;When RootBeer pushed off with his sword, Hyrkan had fallen over backwards. &#xA0;It looked as if he was injuring himself by purpose.</span></p><p><span style="">Chul-puh-duhk! </span></p><p><span style="">He fell backwards like a log.</span></p><p><span style="">This was something one never saw in a battle. &#xA0;RootBeer had conducted countless battles in Warlord, yet he had never experienced this before.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Shit!&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">Even if RootBeer was a skilled User, he wasn&#x2019;t able to react to something he had never experienced before.</span></p><p><span style="">In the end, the sword that contained RootBeer&#x2019;s full strength sliced through empty air before it struck the ground.</span></p><p><span style="">During all of this, Hyrkan had kept rolling away on his side. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">He looked so skilled at the maneuver that it didn&#x2019;t seem like he was wearing a bulky armor.</span></p><p><span style="">It wasn&#x2019;t something he had done only once or twice.</span></p><p><span style="">After Hyrkan moved his body out of harm&apos;s way, he quickly got up. &#xA0;He immediately yelled out towards the battlefield. </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Thank you!&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Catch that bastard!&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">RootBeer yelled out as he looked at Hyrkan.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Kuhk!&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">At that moment, one of Anugas&apos; arm grabbed RootBeer&apos;s arm. &#xA0;RootBeer turned to look at Anugas. &#xA0;Hyrkan shook his head as he watched the sight, and he got the hell out of there.</span></p>
