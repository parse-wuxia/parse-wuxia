<p>Chapter 189 &#x2013; Barbarian King (6)</p><p><span style="">18.</span></p><p><span style="">Ggoo-roong, ggoo-roong!</span></p><p><span style="">Dark clouds appeared in the sky. &#xA0;The dark clouds looked to be thunderclouds as it overtly displayed its might.</span></p><p><span style="">Gulp!</span></p><p><span style="">At this sight, everyone gulped.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Wow. &#xA0;The Hahoe Mask really reached the 2nd Phase by himself.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;The other teams were only able to do it after losing 300 Users&#x2026;.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">At that moment&#x2026;.</span></p><p><span style="">Zzuh-juh-juhk!</span></p><p><span style="">There was no warning. A bolt of thunder fell towards the ground. &#xA0;Everything stopped when the sound of the thunder was heard. &#xA0;It was as if someone had pressed the pause button. &#xA0;All the several thousand small battles going on in the battlefield stopped for a brief moment.</span></p><p><span style="">Then the battle started again.</span></p><p><span style="">&apos;What happened?&apos;</span></p><p><span style="">&apos;Was the Hahoe Mask able to dodge it?&apos;</span></p><p><span style="">&apos;Did he succeed?&apos;</span></p><p><span style="">However, at that moment, the Users in battle only had one thought.</span></p><p><span style="">Did the Hahoe Mask dodge the Storm Judgement? &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">If it had occurred as planned, he would have dodged the Judgement. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">At the same time, was he able to plant the Storm Judgement on the Barbarian King?</span></p><p><span style="">The answer came.</span></p><p><span style="">- Hahoe Mask succeeded on the first one!</span></p><p><span style="">It came out through Voice Talk.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Hell yeah!&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Wow. &#xA0;I got goosebumps right now.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Bullshit. &#xA0;You don&#x2019;t have goosebumps. &#xA0;We are within the game.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;It is a figure of speech.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Ok. &#xA0;Let&#x2019;s do this! &quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;The Hahoe Mask succeeded!&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">A shout akin to a thunder exploded forth from the battlefield. &#xA0;Everyone started shouting for the Hahoe Mask.</span></p><p><span style="">At that moment, Hyrkan had barely avoided the thunder, and he walked near the Barbarian King&#x2019;s heel. &#xA0;Hyrkan swallowed the sigh of relief from coming out of his mouth.</span></p><p><span style="">&apos;&#x2026;&#x2026;wow.&apos;</span></p><p><span style="">When the alert announcing him being the target of the Storm Judgement popped up, the three second countdown had started.</span></p><p><span style="">Three seconds.</span></p><p><span style="">It was a short amount of time where one could let out a long sigh once, and the time would be up. &#xA0;He had only a brief amount of time. &#xA0;The enemy could stomp him, beat him to death with its trunk or squeeze him to death with its grip. &#xA0;However, he had to charge forward towards his enemy despite the danger.</span></p><p><span style="">No explanation was needed. &#xA0;Even if one was able to give a detailed explanation, it was something that wouldn&#x2019;t be believed unless one saw it.</span></p><p><span style="">The bolt of thunder fell, and at that moment, the thunder struck the Barbarian King. &#xA0;Hyrkan slipped to the side, and for a moment, the world became yellow and white.</span></p><p><span style="">He had goosebumps. </span></p><p><span style="">His body shuddered.</span></p><p><span style="">&apos;This is awesome.&apos;</span></p><p><span style="">Moreover, he had a smile on his face.</span></p><p><span style="">&apos;If my timing was off by one second&#x2026; &#xA0;No, if it was off by .5 second, I would have been sent to heaven. &#xA0;It wouldn&#x2019;t have matter what setting I had on.&apos;</span></p><p><span style="">At that moment, Hahoe Mask was wearing fabric clothes. </span></p><p><span style="">The full set was worth 500,000 gold, and it was called the Thunder Mage set. &#xA0;Moreover, he was wearing the Circlet of Purification.</span></p><p><span style="">He had ignored physical defense. &#xA0;This setting was solely put on to increase his resistance against the thunder as much as possible. &#xA0;The Circlet of Purification was chosen to sidestep the inevitable Stun effect that would arise when hit with the Storm Judgement. &#xA0;He didn&#x2019;t know if it&#x2019;ll work against the Storm Judgement, but he decided to equip it.</span></p><p><span style="">His combined outfit was incredibly pricey, and this set would give him one chance.</span></p><p><span style="">Theoretically, It meant he could survive one hit from the Storm Judgement.</span></p><p><span style="">However, when he witnessed the Storm Judgement, Hyrkan&#x2019;s intuition gave a different assessment.</span></p><p><span style="">&apos;There won&#x2019;t be a next time.&apos;</span></p><p><span style="">He had spent an enormous amount of money as a precaution, yet he realized it wouldn&#x2019;t play a role in this battle.</span></p><p><span style="">He couldn&#x2019;t rely on it.</span></p><p><span style="">He had to think of it as him fighting the battle with his bare body. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">He had to think of this as his last and only chance at this.</span></p><p><span style="">&apos;Storm...... &#xA0;I really have a bad relationship with anything that starts with Storm.&apos;</span></p><p><span style="">The funny part was the fact that useless thoughts filled his mind at his most desperate situation.</span></p><p><span style="">The Barbarian King extended its hands towards Hyrkan. &#xA0;Hyrkan dodged a hand. &#xA0;Then he kept dodging.</span></p><p><span style="">Hweek hweek!</span></p><p><span style="">The Barbarian King&#x2019;s attack was akin to a boxer jabbing with his fists.</span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan dodged them all.</span></p><p><span style="">The Barbarian King became frustrated at the nimble Hyrkan, so it brought up its trunk up high before it swung the trunk downward like a whip.</span></p><p><span style="">Gwah-ahng!</span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan threw his body to avoid the Barbarian King&#x2019;s elephant-like trunk. &#xA0;It had come down like a bolt of lightning. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">However, he didn&#x2019;t run away too far. &#xA0;He had to maintain a certain distance. &#xA0;If he was too far away, he wouldn&#x2019;t be able to get close to the Barbarian King when the Judgement starts.</span></p><p><span style="">[The Storm Judgement is heading towards you.]</span></p><p><span style="">[3... 2...]</span></p><p><span style="">When the Announcement popped up, Hyrkan dove between the Barbarian King&#x2019;s legs.</span></p><p><span style="">Jjuh-juh-juhk!</span></p><p><span style="">The thunderbolt impacted on the Barbarian King&#x2019;s body. &#xA0;At that moment, Hyrkan could feel it.</span></p><p><span style="">&apos;It is a lightning rod. &#xA0;If a thunder strikes near the Barbarian King, the Barbarian King will absorb everything.&apos;</span></p><p><span style="">He realized he didn&#x2019;t need to be too fine with the timing.</span></p><p><span style="">As expected, this was the method that had to be used to defeat this monster. &#xA0;Moreover, this leniency was a little bit of courtesy given by Warlord to the User, who carried out this method.</span></p><p><span style="">&apos;Fuck. &#xA0;I&#x2019;m so thankful that tears are coming out.&apos;</span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan was serious. &#xA0;The courtesy almost brought him to tears, and as if to pay back this courtesy, Hyrkan once again engaged the Barbarian King. &#xA0;While Hyrkan confronted it, he looked at the status of the Barbarian King.</span></p><p><span style="">The Barbarian King&#x2019;s body looked a bit charred, but it was still imposing. &#xA0;He didn&#x2019;t know how many times he would have to repeat this action. &#xA0;The 31st Raid team had succeeded in this method thrice before they gave up on the Raid.</span></p><p><span style="">It could be three, ten or twenty times. &#xA0;It could also be 31 times to mirror the number of Protection Gems possessed by the Barbarian King.</span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan gritted his teeth.</span></p><p><span style="">&apos;There&#x2019;s no tree that won&#x2019;t fall if you strike it 10 times. &#xA0;It would be great if Warlord&#x2019;s AI knew this adage&#x2026;.</span></p><p><span style="">Zzuh-juhk!</span></p><p><span style="">This was the 11th Storm Judgement. &#xA0;It let out a fierce thunderclap as it fell.</span></p><p><span style="">It was as if this sound had been the signal. &#xA0;The two groups on standby moved at that moment. &#xA0;They had been far away, but in short order, they came close to the wall of Users protecting the Hahoe Mask.</span></p><p><span style="">When the Users saw the two groups approaching, they looked at them with suspicion. &#xA0;Their glares turned into a look of shock.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;It&apos;s the Stormhunters!&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;It&apos;s the Red Bulls!&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">These were two enormous guilds.</span></p><p><span style="">The Red Bulls had been the dragon hidden under the water until now. &#xA0;The Stormhunters guild had been at the forefront of leading this era.</span></p><p><span style="">The two guilds didn&#x2019;t hide their emblems as they charged towards the stage where the Barbarian King was present.</span></p><p><span style="">Whistling had been going around taking down Users and monsters trying to approach the Hahoe Mask. &#xA0;The news was quickly delivered to Whistling&#x2019;s ears.</span></p><p><span style="">&apos;Of all the&#x2026;.&apos;</span></p><p><span style="">He knew disrupters would come. &#xA0;In truth, there had been couple disrupters here already. &#xA0;However, he would have never imagined that the Red Bulls and the Stormhunters fell into the same category. &#xA0;He didn&#x2019;t know about the other guilds, but he had thought these two guilds had the pride and self respect that came with their position in the 30 great guilds.</span></p><p><span style="">&apos;As expected, they are putting profits above all else?&apos;</span></p><p><span style="">Of course, he understood why they were doing this.</span></p><p><span style="">The 30 great guilds of Warlord were organizations that were mostly driven by profit. &#xA0;They were basically companies. &#xA0;Their goal was to make money through this game.</span></p><p><span style="">To them, the Barbarian King Raid was worth&#x2026;.</span></p><p><span style="">At the very least, it would be a figure normal people would balk at. &#xA0;It was probably an enormous amount of money.</span></p><p><span style="">Anyways, the worst case scenario had just occurred.</span></p><p><span style="">&apos;How long will they be able to last?&apos;</span></p><p><span style="">He was sure of it. &#xA0;It was impossible to stop them.</span></p><p><span style="">However, could they draw out the fight?</span></p><p><span style="">The fact that he was having such thoughts was the height of arrogance. &#xA0;Whistling, Yojori, Joba and all the regular Users could only buy some time. &#xA0;That was the only thing they could do.</span></p><p><span style="">The only thing up in the air was how long they would be able to drag this out.</span></p><p><span style="">Gulp!</span></p><p><span style="">Whistling unconsciously gulped. &#xA0;&#xA0;In truth, he didn&#x2019;t know how to deal with this situation.</span></p><p><span style="">&apos;Shit.&apos;</span></p><p><span style="">He felt an indescribable sense of despair. &#xA0;Then the despair immediately changed in sorriness towards Hyrkan.</span></p><p><span style="">In the end, Whistling had precipitated this.</span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan didn&#x2019;t need this stage. &#xA0;He could prove his worth, and be treated well elsewhere. &#xA0;However, Whistling had brought him to this abyss. &#xA0;The only thing that could comfort Hyrkan was a victory and success. &#xA0;That was it.</span></p><p><span style="">However, everything was about to be ruined. &#xA0;They were treading water to stay above the abyss.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Excuse me. &#xA0;Shouldn&apos;t we tell him?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Yojori asked the question. &#xA0;Hahoe Mask still didn&#x2019;t know about the appearance of the two large guilds.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;No.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Whistling asked Yojori to keep silent.</span></p><p><span style="">He couldn&#x2019;t tell Hyrkan about this situation. &#xA0;Hyrkan was currently fighting a life and death battle with the Barbarian King, and his words might cause him to die. &#xA0;Hyrkan was fighting a battle where 1 second determined his fate. &#xA0;&#xA0;It was a battle with a razor thin margin.</span></p><p><span style="">As a friend, Whistling wanted to help in anyway he could. &#xA0;He wanted Hyrkan to be left alone, so he could carry out the battle. &#xA0;This was the only way he could repay his friend.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;We&#x2019;ll just have to block them.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Whistling gritted his teeth.</span></p><p><span style="">He had already been prepared for death.</span></p><p><span style="">Moreover, at that moment, Whistling was thinking of different ways he could threaten the two guilds. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">Was there anyway he could file a lawsuit against the Stormhunters and Redbulls for using such tactics?</span></p><p><span style="">Could he use this threat to scare them off?</span></p><p><span style="">His mind mulled over the problem.</span></p><p><span style="">However, he didn&#x2019;t have much time to ponder over this problem.</span></p><p><span style="">Whistling could see the Stormhunters guild close the distance with the Hahoe Mask and the Barbarian King. &#xA0;They were turning aside the wall of Users easily. &#xA0;Moreover, Whistling could see, who was in the front.</span></p><p><span style="">&apos;My god.&apos;</span></p><p><span style="">Storm Queen Shir!</span></p><p><span style="">She was leading from the front. &#xA0;Aside from the Hahoe Mask, she was called the strongest in Warlord. &#xA0;Moreover, it would be useless to bring lawyers, the justice system and a lawsuit against her. &#xA0;It wouldn&#x2019;t work on her.</span></p><p><span style="">Whistling was about to lose his fighting spirit. &#xA0;His face looked like the face of a fighting dog, but the fight was about drain out of him.</span></p><p><span style="">&apos;Wow. &#xA0;It&#x2019;s the Storm Queen.&apos;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Even if I die here, I can boast about this to everyone.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Everyone else pretty much assumed they were all going to die early on. &#xA0;At that moment, Whistling sheathed his sword.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;You shall not pass!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Then he yelled out.</span></p><p><span style="">He used all his strength to do so.</span></p><p><span style="">In his lifetime, Whistling had never yelled this loud before. &#xA0;It was as if he was barfing out everything within him into this shout.</span></p><p><span style="">At the shout, the Stormhunters and the Storm Queen came to a stop.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;If you have pride in yourself as the 30 great guilds, you should leave this to the Hahoe Mask. &#xA0;You should think about the etiquette within Warlord!&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">They stopped, but Whistling kept shouting.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;At the very least, you should keep the gamer&#x2019;s code of conduct!&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">At Whistling&#x2019;s shout, Shirt glared at Whistling. &#xA0;Shir, who was looking straight at Whistling, was beautiful. &#xA0;However, her expression was indescribably cold. &#xA0;Whistling didn&#x2019;t avoid her gaze. &#xA0;He glared at her like a fighting dog.</span></p><p><span style="">While this terrifying war of gazes was occurring, a third person spoke up.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;We are here to make a deal with the Hahoe Mask.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Ballista Hatch.</span></p><p><span style="">He had been at the back of the group. &#xA0;He ran forward as he shouted.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;We started the Barbarian King event. &#xA0;Of course, we also possess the key that will allow us to finish off the Barbarian King. &#xA0;If we let things be, the Barbarian King will start up its activities again.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Hatch gave an explanation.</span></p><p><span style="">When he ended the explanation, Shir added her words.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Even if I do fight with the Hahoe Mask, there is no way I&#x2019;ll fight him here. &#xA0;So get out of my way.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Whistling gritted his teeth.</span></p><p><span style="">19.</span></p><p><span style="">When the thunder fell another 10 times, the Barbarian King froze in place.</span></p><p><span style="">He stood erect.</span></p><p><span style="">It was like a statue.</span></p><p><span style="">However, the Barbarian King was still alive.</span></p><p><span style="">&apos;Ah&#xFF01;&apos;</span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan watched this sight, and for the first time, he let out a sigh of relief inside his head.</span></p><p><span style="">The clear method was effective.</span></p><p><span style="">[The Barbarian King Nesha has fallen asleep.]</span></p><p><span style="">[The Barbarian King Nesha will awaken in 24 hours.]</span></p><p><span style="">However, the next System Announcement knocked down all his achievements in one fell swoop.</span></p><p><span style="">&apos;This fucking game!&apos;</span></p><p><span style="">It was the worst possible situation.</span></p><p><span style="">He was well aware of the possibility of a 3rd Phase. &#xA0;He had expected the Barbarian King to go nuts, so he had prepared accordingly. &#xA0;However, he hadn&#x2019;t been prepared for this scenario.</span></p><p><span style="">At the same time, he had no idea how he should deal with this scenario.</span></p><p><span style="">[Barbarian King Nessa will awaken from his sleep in 23 hours 50 seconds.]</span></p><p><span style="">In front of Hyrkan, the Warlord started its cold, heartless and cruel countdown.</span></p><p><span style="">&apos;I...... I have to kill this bastard.&apos;</span></p><p><span style="">At that moment, Hyrkan thought about all the Users, who had given up their lives for him.</span></p><p><span style="">Losses? </span></p><p><span style="">That didn&#x2019;t matter.</span></p><p><span style="">It hadn&#x2019;t been important in the first place. &#xA0;He didn&#x2019;t play this game for the money. &#xA0;He had needed the money to become the best in Warlord.</span></p><p><span style="">He was afraid of the disappointment.</span></p><p><span style="">These Users had put their lives on the line for him. &#xA0;They had fought for his victory, and even the dead Users were cheering from outside the game. &#xA0;He was afraid of the sense of disappointment that&#x2019;ll be felt by those people.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I have to kill it!&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Eventually, he shouted at the top of his lungs towards the Barbarian King Nessa.</span></p><p><span style="">-Hyrkan. &#xA0;The Stormhunters guild and Red Bulls guild is heading your way.</span></p><p><span style="">At that moment, he heard Whistling&#x2019;s voice.</span></p><p><span style="">-They want to propose a deal.</span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan turned his head. &#xA0;He could see a large group heading towards the center of the plain.</span></p><p><span style="">He could see her.</span></p><p><span style="">Storm Queen Shir!</span></p><p><span style="">She wasn&#x2019;t wearing her helmet, and her hair was whipping around her. &#xA0;She brought her group towards him.</span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan looked at them.</span></p><p><span style="">As time passed, Shir and Hyrkan stared at each other.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;This will be my final proposal.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Shir opened her mouth.</span></p>
