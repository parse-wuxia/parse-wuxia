<p><span style="">Chapter 127 - Argardo Raid (2)&#xA0;</span></p><p>5.</p><p><span style="">Through the sacrifice of an unknown magician, the Cursed castle had been sealed in its appalling state. The castle regained its light through the actions of four heroes. &#xA0;Afterwards, those equipped with fancy Items filled up the castle. &#xA0;A flower had bloomed, and it was named Havanz castle.</span></p><p><span style="">However, the elegant castle was now stained alongside the White-eyed Knight. &#xA0;The Havanz castle&apos;s appearance turned more horrifying in appearance than the time it was called the Cursed Castle. A worse sense of despair filled the castle.</span></p><p><span style="">To fight against this despair, stars instead of fancy flowers started to gather.</span></p><p><span style="">Users that numbered easily over a thousand was positioned at a location where they could see the Havanz castle. &#xA0;This wasn&apos;t a village. &#xA0;There was no barricades formed here. If one insisted on making a comparison, this was like a massive camping ground or something similar to one. &#xA0;In the normal logic of Warlord, this was a dangerous thing to be doing. &#xA0;They were basically defenseless against the attacks of monsters.</span></p><p><span style="">However, none of the Users here were worried. &#xA0;The monsters that appeared near Havanz castle was like pocket change or an ice cream dessert that cleansed their palate. &#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">Currently, beings that would freak out even these Users had just appeared.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;It&apos;s been awhile.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">A star amongst stars had appeared. &#xA0;In fact, there was more than one. &#xA0;Two stars had appeared. </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I&#x2019;m talking to you. Isn&apos;t it normal for a person to at least nod their head? Why do you have to behave so coldly towards me?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What business do you have with me?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">It was Shir and Chev.</span></p><p><span style="">Users of great skill and renown had appeared in front of the Havanz castle for the Argardo Raid. &#xA0;However, they paled in comparison to these two. These Users were no longer qualified to play a leading role or a supporting role. They had been turned into spectators in front of these two. </span></p><p><span style="">The Users focused their attention on the meeting happening between these two.</span></p><p><span style="">These two were stars amongst stars. &#xA0;Shir and Chev wasn&apos;t bother by all the gazes focused on them as they revealed their true colors. Shir was treating Chev in a very cold manner. &#xA0;There was no need to act as if they were on good terms. &#xA0;Moreover, there was a good reason why they weren&apos;t on good terms.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I&apos;m not here for anything too important. &#xA0;I checked your number, and you guys are going after us. &#xA0;So I decided to greet you.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Shir&apos;s expression crumpled at Chev&apos;s words.</span></p><p><span style="">This was the reason why their already bad relationship had worsened.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;You are here to provoke me.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;No way.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Anyone could see that the Argardo Raid was like an exclamation point to the great battle. &#xA0;This was why everyone competed with each other to participate in the Argardo Raid. &#xA0;The order had been determined through lottery. The Stormhunters were going right after the Red Bulls.</span></p><p><span style="">Of course, it soured Shir&apos;s mood.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;If it was any other guild than the Red Bulls....&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">The Stormhunters guild was pretty far down the queue. &#xA0;Including the Red Bulls, there were a total of four guilds from the 30 great guilds in front of her.</span></p><p><span style="">However, only the Red Bulls was a thorn in her eyes. If other guilds succeed in the Argardo Raid, it would be considered a miracle. &#xA0;However, this could be an easy win for the Red Bulls. &#xA0;This was how highly she thought of the Red Bulls.</span></p><p><span style="">On top of it all, Chev had come to check up on the situation himself even though their turn wasn&#x2019;t up yet.</span></p><p><span style="">This wasn&#x2019;t an attempt by the Red Bulls to use a hot topic to sell more live tickets. &#xA0;His actions was meant to say he was going to attempt this as if everything was on the line.</span></p><p><span style="">Shir was here for similar reasons as Chev.</span></p><p><span style="">Chev had come close to provoking Shir on purpose for similar reasons too.</span></p><p><span style="">They weren&apos;t competitors that were fighting head to head against each other. &#xA0;The two of them had their arrows aimed at the same target. There was no way a cordial atmosphere could blossom in this situation. Instead, sparks were flying between them.</span></p><p><span style="">Everyone gossiped as they saw this sight.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I guess one of those two guilds will succeed.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Don&apos;t you think Red Bulls have the higher probability to kill it?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;It&apos;s the opposite. &#xA0;If the Red Bulls reveal most of their strategy in the Raid, Storm Hunter&apos;s success rate would rise significantly.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;It is a matter of if one will eat first or eat off the floor.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">There was someone, who was viewing these two Users, with very sharp eyes.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;In the end, the Hahoe Mask made it possible for those two to take flight. &#xA0;He did something very troublesome.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">Sinclair was with the V&amp;V guild. &#xA0;He was here as a the member of the Raid party. &#xA0;They were going to attempt the Argardo raid in several hours. &#xA0;He let out a bitter when he saw the Storm Queen and the Matador appear.</span></p><p><span style="">However, there was someone observing Sinclair with sharp eyes.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;What is that bastard here?&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">This User was wearing a blandly designed steel armor. His helmet covered his whole face, and he wore a cape. He looked like a typical Swordsman Class type User that one could see everywhere in Warlord. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">When Hyrkan discovered Sinclair, his heart sank. </span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;This is going sideways again. Why the hell is that bastard here with the V&amp;V logo on his chest?&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan wasn&apos;t here to participate in the Argardo Raid by himself. </span></p><p><span style="">Argardo dropped incredible Items. The Argardo Armor set was a level 180 Chronicle Unique Rank Item. The Crying Sword was a level 180 Chronicle Epic Item. The two Items could be used until mid level 200s. The weapon was a very good one.</span></p><p><span style="">However, it would be difficult for Hyrkan to gain this weapon.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Shit. It won&apos;t be easy to join as the third wheel.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">The Argardo Raid couldn&apos;t be soloed. If he only had to fight Argardo, Hyrkan would have attempted the Raid already. Of course, his chances wouldn&#x2019;t be great.</span></p><p><span style="">The problem with the Argardo Raid was the fact that this wasn&#x2019;t a simple Boss Raid. &#xA0;This was a Raid happening in the framework of the great battle.</span></p><p><span style="">First, one had to defeat the Corrupted army defending the Havanz castle. &#xA0;Then one had to climb the castle wall. &#xA0;One had to win the siege of the Havanz castle to be able to acquire a ticket to fight Argardo. &#xA0;However, this was impossible for Hyrkan to do by himself. </span></p><p><span style="">This was why Hyrkan had planned on making a deal. He had planned on joining a decent Underfoot guild that was an ace card short of winning this Raid. &#xA0;From their perspective, there was no reason why they would refuse the deal.</span></p><p><span style="">At the very least, it wouldn&#x2019;t prevent others especially the 30 great guilds from killing Argardo. &#xA0;The deal would be much better than sucking their thumbs as others killed Argardo.</span></p><p><span style="">However, Sinclair had appeared as the member of V&amp;V guild. &#xA0;Sinclair was a User that already tried to kill Hyrkan. There had been no discernable reason behind it. &#xA0;He thoughtlessly attempted a PK on Hyrkan.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;If I talk about the Watchman style once again in front of him, I bet he&apos;ll try to find my house and beat me up.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">If Hyrkan was in Sinclair&apos;s shoes, his eyes would roll back in anger once he spotted him.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Shit. &#xA0;It seems I&apos;ll have to change my plan.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan once again swallowed the bitter words. &#xA0;At that moment, Sinclair turned his head slightly to look at Hyrkan. &#xA0;Sinclair had felt Hyrkan looking at him. At that moment, Hyrkan was freaking out, but &#xA0;he didn&#x2019;t show any outward signs. &#xA0;If he looked away or turned his gaze away, it would make Sinclair suspicious.</span></p><p><span style="">Sinclair tilted his head in confusion when he saw Hyrkan.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Who is that? &#xA0;Is he looking at me? &#xA0;Am I tripping?&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">That was the extent of this thoughts.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ah. &#xA0;They are moving.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What were they talking about?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Shir and Chev had finished their conversation. &#xA0;They turned their backs, and they walked away from each other. &#xA0;The gazes that had been on the two split as they went in different directions. &#xA0;When they disappeared from the stage, the Users were filled with &#xA0;curiosity. &#xA0;They started talking to each other privately.</span></p><p><span style="">In such a restless atmosphere, Sinclair and Hyrkan was nowhere to be seen.</span></p><p>6.</p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Give up! Give up on it!&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">When that shout was heard, the Argardo Raid&#x2019;s message board became noisy.</span></p><p><span style="">- They admitted defeat! &#xA0;They couldn&apos;t even get over the castle wall!</span></p><p><span style="">- Mediocre Users were gathered to increase the headcount. &#xA0;This was to be expected.</span></p><p><span style="">- I got a 1.05 times return. &#xA0;Thank you for the meal.</span></p><p><span style="">- &#x3134; I flagged you for illegal betting before I leave.</span></p><p><span style="">The Users gathered to make the Kill the Knight Team to run the Argardo Raid. However, this team had just gave up on the Raid.</span></p><p><span style="">The Kill the Knight was a team created by 1,200 Users. This team couldn&apos;t even climb the castle wall that had been crushed by the Raid Teams before them. &#xA0;Of course, the Cement Worms were working on repairing the fallen castle wall, so it was only somewhat patched up. &#xA0;The Kill the Knight team wanted to take advantage of this fact, yet their battle was conducted in a very sloppy manner.</span></p><p><span style="">The critical blow came when the castle wall fell. &#xA0;The Users rushed in to enter the castle when the entrance became congested. &#xA0;This congestion allowed the enemies to use AOE attacks to cause Game Over to a lot of Users.</span></p><p><span style="">This was why retaking the castles were scary. &#xA0;It was as it was revealed in the Hahoe Mask&#x2019;s know-how video. &#xA0;The attack on the congestion assured a certain victory in the defense of the castles. &#xA0;However, the congestion was now morphed into an obstacle for the Users. &#xA0;This method of attack assured certain victory, and it wasn&#x2019;t easy to come up with a method to counter it.</span></p><p><span style="">In truth, no one had expected the Kill the Knight team to succeed. &#xA0;One needed incredible amount of magical firepower to clear away the monsters like the Sweepers guild, or one needed a peerless heavyweight that could make split-second decisions within a battle. &#xA0;It was meaningless to have only a high number of Users.</span></p><p><span style="">- Too bad about the V&amp;V guild. &#xA0;They were able to reach the battle with Argardo, but they had to retreat eventually.</span></p><p><span style="">- Since we are talking about the V&amp;V guild, there was a User that was incredibly skilled User that was killing the monsters. &#xA0;Why didn&#x2019;t that User step up to fight Argardo?</span></p><p><span style="">- &#x3134; I&apos;m also curious. &#xA0;He fought better than the Users that actually fought Argard. &#xA0;However, he was missing.</span></p><p><span style="">The Warlord fans were excited about the 3 teams that would be attempting the Raid after the Kill the Knight team.</span></p><p><span style="">- Anyways, this 3 consecutive battles will settle it.</span></p><p><span style="">- That&apos;s true. </span></p><p><span style="">It was set up in such a way that three guilds in the 30 great guilds were attempting the Argardo Raid one after another. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">- So the order is Big Smiles, Red Bulls and Stormhunter?</span></p><p><span style="">In terms of conducting Raids, these two guilds were opined to being the best in Warlord. &#xA0;This fact was why everyone had high expectations. &#xA0;They were overflowing with anticipation. It wasn&#x2019;t an exaggeration to say that if these two guilds failed, no one could think of any other guilds that would be able to succeed in the Raid.</span></p><p><span style="">Of course, there was also the guild that became the butt of the joke.</span></p><p><span style="">- Even if Big Smiles will be the card that will be discarded, Red Bulls and the Stormhunter will end this.</span></p><p><span style="">- &#x3134; Why is the Big Smiles the card that is being thrown away? &#xA0;They are the strongest guild in China. If we compare the Big Smiles to the other two guilds, there is no reason why Big Smiles should be put on a lower standing.</span></p><p><span style="">- &#x3134; Strongest in China = Weakest in the world. </span></p><p><span style="">- &#x3134; They only know how to move in big numbers. &#xA0;What else are they good at?</span></p><p><span style="">- &#x3134; They move in swarms, and they get beat a lot. &#xA0;They are very good at that.</span></p><p><span style="">- &#x3134; I&#x2019;ll give you a 1 thumbs up. </span></p><p><span style="">The Big Smiles were put in the a conversation alongside the other two guilds, and they were being roasted mercilessly.</span></p><p><span style="">The result of these opinions appeared in the amount of live tickets that was sold. &#xA0;The Big Smile&#x2019;s Argardo Raid only sold 290,000 live tickets. &#xA0;Even if one took into account of having only one day to sell the ticket, Big Smiles had the largest pool of fans from China. &#xA0;From Big Smiles&#x2019; perspective, this hurt their pride.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Shit. They want me to stay as rear support doing the useless tasks. They are completely treating me like trash. &#xA0;How dare they!&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">He didn&apos;t really care about this Raid, but he was put in rear support even though he was an officer. &#xA0;If he wanted to describe the situation with a Korean expression, he had joined in this Raid as a side dish. &#xA0;It was a big hit to Apollo&apos;s pride.</span></p><p><span style="">Chiroro was once again put next to Apollo to appease him. &#xA0;His pride was hurt in a big way too, and it was twisting everything he felt.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;You are trash.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">Apollo wasn&apos;t qualified to participate in a Raid of this level. He wasn&apos;t short on Items and levels, but his personal skills were very lacking. If this Raid had a cap on how many people could participate in it, Apollo&apos;s name wouldn&apos;t even have made it onto the reserve list. This was the opposite situation where there were no constraints on how many Users the guild could bring. &#xA0;This was the reason why Apollo was able to participate in the Argardo Raid.</span></p><p><span style="">Of course, that wasn&apos;t the only reason.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;If you hadn&apos;t paid off Brooks, no one would choose a trash like you.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">Brooks was an officer of the Big Smiles, and he had helped Apollo get in on the Raid. &#xA0;In simple terms, Brooks had been bribed.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;I wonder how much he is getting?&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">This was obvious, but everything Apollo did was possible, because he had given Brooks a lot of money.</span></p><p><span style="">From Chiroro&#x2019;s perspective, he didn&#x2019;t like the current situation at all. &#xA0;He didn&#x2019;t like attending Apollo. &#xA0;On top of it all, he had no expectation regarding the Argardo Raid.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Our guild is hanging by a thread. &#xA0;Why are we doing this Raid? &#xA0;It isn&#x2019;t as if we brought our main force.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">The Big Smiles was attempting the Argardo Raid since it was a hot topic right now. &#xA0;It seemed they were just thinking about selling some live tickets. Of course, there was a reason behind this. &#xA0;Big Smiles guild had been one of the nine guilds that announced their nonparticipation. &#xA0;They probably wouldn&#x2019;t have done this if they hadn&#x2019;t announced their nonparticipation. </span></p><p><span style="">It was a fact. &#xA0;They had no chance of winning.</span></p><p><span style="">The details of the plan hasn&#x2019;t come out yet, but Chiroro could tell what would happen. &#xA0;They&#x2019;ll get past the castle wall, and they&#x2019;ll get to see Argardo&#x2019;s face. &#xA0;After tangling with Argardo, they&#x2019;ll leave after the requisite time was filled. &#xA0;Since they&#x2019;ve sold the live tickets, they would have to maintain the battle for an hour. &#xA0;That was how long a normal Raid took.</span></p><p><span style="">When his thoughts reached that point, Chiroro&#x2019;s face unconsciously twisted to reveal his true feelings. &#xA0;He was about to lose control over his expression.</span></p><p><span style="">It happened at that moment...</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Aren&apos;t you Chiroro-nim?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Someone was calling out Chiroro&#x2019;s name as he was approaching him. Chiroro&apos;s expression immediately changed when he saw the him.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Sinclair-nim?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">The identity of this Users was Sinclair, who had participated the Argardo raid as a member of the V&amp;V guild. &#xA0;He had finished participating in the Argardo Raid, yet he was back once again after only a short amount of time had passed.</span></p><p><span style="">Of course, he wasn&apos;t here to meet Chiroro. &#xA0;He wanted to check on the progress of the Stormhunters and Red Bulls. Still, it was a bit awkward for him to stand there by himself, since the V&amp;V guild had already left. Sinclair decided to greet Chiroro, who was close to being an officer in the Big Smiles guild.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What are you doing here?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I was about to pass by after I assess the situation, and I caught sight of Chiroro-nim. &#xA0;I came here to greet you.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I&apos;m not at a level where I should be greeted by you. I&apos;m honored.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">The two of them weren&apos;t that close. &#xA0;Sinclair had helped out the Big Smiles guild several times, and Chiroro had been present during such an event.</span></p><p><span style="">On the other hand, Apollo didn&apos;t have any connections to Sinclair. &#xA0;From Apollo&apos;s perspective, he suddenly felt listless.</span></p><p><span style="">Apollo was impatient as he opened his mouth.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Who is this?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Chiroro&apos;s expression crumpled slightly at the question. However, Apollo was an officer, so he couldn&apos;t just brush him off. Chiroro introduced Sinclar to Apollo. &#xA0;After introductions, the two Users shook hands.</span></p><p><span style="">At that moment, two Users located not too far away were also shaking hand. &#xA0;They were standing in a &#xA0;very secluded location where no one could see them.</span></p><p>7.</p><p><span style="">A Raid was like a game of Go.</span></p><p><span style="">An opponent always moved in a pattern. One had to analyze this pattern, and one had to come up with a way to deal with this pattern. One had to try to read the opponent&apos;s move, and the opponent would react accordingly. Raid was only a several degree different from Go.</span></p><p><span style="">It wasn&apos;t easy to come up with a plan for a Raid assault. With regards to coming up with a plan, there was a strategist that was known to be very good working for the Red Bulls, and he had come up with a plan for the Argardo raid.</span></p><p><span style="">However, the plan that was made by the strategist Nunum was scrapped.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Are we really going to do this?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">It was an order from Chev.</span></p><p><span style="">He suddenly requested a sudden change in the plan.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Is it possible?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I can do it, but do you really want to do this?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">The reason behind this move was too surprising. This was why Nunum was asking the question again. However, Chev answered the question with a smile. &#xA0;However, the smile didn&apos;t explain anything, so he still had a silly expression on his face. Finally, Chev explained his decision. </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;In any case, our chance for victory isn&apos;t that high. If that is the case, I would rather make this more fun. We have to take our viewers into account. &#xA0;At the very least, our viewers won&apos;t be disappointed if we use this method.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">At those words, Nunum put on an awkward smile as he thought about it.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;They won&apos;t be a disappointed. &#xA0;It&apos;ll be a jackpot no matter the result.&#x2019;</span></p>
