<p><span style="">Chapter 163 - Anugas&#x2019; Necklace (2)</span></p><p>5.</p><p><span style="">It was a house that had a great night view. &#xA0;The house had a wine cellar, so one could enjoy this night scene with wine. &#xA0;The wine cellar looked quite expensive, and it was filled with expensive wines. &#xA0;There wasn&apos;t much space to move within it.</span></p><p><span style="">- It is a really nice house.</span></p><p><span style="">- Yes. &#xA0;I decided to indulge myself by moving into this place. &#xA0;When I used to be a baseball player, I always wanted to live in a place like this.</span></p><p><span style="">The interview was being conducted with the fancy house as the background.</span></p><p><span style="">The interviewee was Jameis Jones. &#xA0;He was more famously known as BigK in Warlord.</span></p><p><span style="">During the Warlord&apos;s second Main Scenario Quest, BigK entered the ranks of the 1st team Raid member after he distinguished himself in the great battle event. &#xA0;Afterwards, he participated in Red Bull&apos;s core quests and Raids. &#xA0;He showed off his surprising Skill, and now he was considered to be one of the top Magicians of the Red Bulls.</span></p><p><span style="">- When I failed to break into the Major League, I thought my dream was crushed. &#xA0;I never expected to achieve my dream through this game.</span></p><p><span style="">His life had changed after the second Main Scenario Quest.</span></p><p><span style="">The most clear-cut evidence of the change was his residence.</span></p><p><span style="">He was now the owner of a house that anyone would envy. &#xA0;Moreover, a regular person would never be given a chance to be featured in such an interview.</span></p><p><span style="">- This is the age we are living in. &#xA0;Riches and fame can be had for people, who are good at playing games.</span></p><p><span style="">- This might be a bit of a rude question. &#xA0;It hasn&apos;t been too long since BigK-nim&apos;s career has taken off. &#xA0;However, you are already making a good deal of money. &#xA0;Could you guess at how much the most famous Users of Warlord make? &#xA0;I&apos;m talking about the Users that even people unfamiliar with Warlord knows. &#xA0;This is the most burning question amongst our viewers.</span></p><p><span style="">- I&apos;m not them, so I can&apos;t be sure. &#xA0;However, if I had to guess.... &#xA0;Currently, the two most famous Users in Warlord is the Storm Queen and the Hahoe Mask. &#xA0;The Storm Queen is already famous for being an heiress, so we should exclude her. &#xA0;The Hahoe Mask.... &#xA0;The house I live in right now is probably the size of his wine cellar.</span></p><p><span style="">- That is incredible.</span></p><p><span style="">- Of course, the Hahoe Mask&apos;s identity is still a mystery, but there is wide consensus that he is incredibly rich.</span></p><p><span style="">Ahn-jaehyun was too flabbergasted by the video he was watching. &#xA0;The half-eaten Chocobar fell to the floor.</span></p><p><span style="">Chul-puhk! </span></p><p><span style="">The Chocobar was mushy, because it had melted. &#xA0;The Chocobar was in rough shape when it fell to the floor. &#xA0;Ahn-jaehyun picked up the Chocobar, and he checked if there was anything stuck to it. &#xA0;When he didn&apos;t see anything, he put the Chocobar back into his mouth.</span></p><p><span style="">Moreover, he continued to look at the video with a flabbergasted expression. &#xA0;Ahn-jaehyun had been wordlessly watching the video, but he spoke without meaning to.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Have these bastards lost their collective minds?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Gulp.</span></p><p><span style="">Ahn-jaehyun chewed and swallowed the Chocobar. &#xA0;After tapping his Tablet PC several times, he switched the content on the screen.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;So this is how they are going to trouble me?&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">He had started watching this video, since he had heard about the recent news regarding the Red Bulls guild.</span></p><p><span style="">The Red Bulls guild&apos;s 1st team members had been conspicuously absent from the spotlight in recent days. &#xA0;Numerous guilds were trying very hard to get across the Urugal mountain range, yet he hadn&apos;t heard a single rumor regarding the Red Bulls guild being nearby.</span></p><p><span style="">This meant the Red Bulls guild was progressing on a secret big project in a different region. &#xA0;This was why he had been collecting information on them, and he had come across BigK&apos;s recent interview. </span></p><p><span style="">Still, he never expected things to progress in this fashion.</span></p><p><span style="">Ahn-jaehyun looked at the screen of the Tablet PC with annoyed eyes, and he kept swiping at the screen. &#xA0;His temperamental actions came to a pause when Ahn-jaehyun came upon the page where he had uploaded the most recent video regarding the Skull Collector. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">He had already seen this page over several dozen times, yet the sight in front of him never failed to transform his bitterness into sweetness.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;The timing of the release was spot on.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">He had caught the Skull Collector a while ago. &#xA0;He had left the production of the Skull Collector Hunt video to the Romani films, and the final video was sent to him four days ago.</span></p><p><span style="">However, Ahn-jaehyun hadn&apos;t immediately uploaded the video.</span></p><p><span style="">This was the footage showing the Death Knight&apos;s first appearance. &#xA0;This video was monumental for several reasons, but he held back uploading the video. &#xA0;He waited for the right time.</span></p><p><span style="">Moreover, he came up with a plan when Anugas appeared.</span></p><p><span style="">He decided to put the video up on his Youtube page when he completed the Anugas Raid.</span></p><p><span style="">His aim was simple. &#xA0;When the Anugas Raid starts, everyone&apos;s attention would be focused on the Black Continent. &#xA0;When the Anugas Raid ended, everyone&apos;s attention would be shifted towards the Hahoe Mask.</span></p><p><span style="">What would happen if he uploaded the video at that moment?</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;I&apos;ll easily get 100 million views.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">His aim was right on target.</span></p><p><span style="">In just a single day, he recorded 40 million views. &#xA0;He wouldn&apos;t have problem getting 100 million views. &#xA0;He could probably double that number.</span></p><p><span style="">The reaction was also quite good. &#xA0;His 6 sponsors were full of praise regarding the video.</span></p><p><span style="">His bank account was beyond being in a good state as his sponsorship funds came in. &#xA0;It was rather impressive.</span></p><p><span style="">This pretty much washed away all the unpleasant feelings he had earlier. </span></p><p><span style="">Ahn-jaehyun considered the interview to be unpleasant, but now he had the foundation needed to turn BigK&apos;s words into reality.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Anguas&apos; Necklace, Token of the Secret Society, Deposed Prince&apos;s Sword..... &#xA0;Basically, I&apos;ve reached the endgame in regards to Items.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">Basically, he had gathered all the arsenal he would need.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;I really reached this point.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">This feeling was sudden and unexpected.</span></p><p><span style="">He had continued forward in the face of all kinds of hardship and suffering. &#xA0;He had finally reached this point, and he took an assessment of himself.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;I&apos;m really here.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">He was proud of himself.</span></p><p><span style="">Everyone including Ahn-jaehyun himself thought this was impossible to do. &#xA0;The task he set out to do was considered to be beyond impossible. &#xA0;It was idiotic. &#xA0;He was given an unprecedented second opportunity, and it had felt as if he was wasting this opportunity by pursuing the unachievable. &#xA0;It was so stupid that Ahn-jaehyun had yelled at himself before.</span></p><p><span style="">However, he had finally achieved this idiotic task.</span></p><p><span style="">He was pleased.</span></p><p><span style="">A happy smile formed when he saw the figure within his bank account.</span></p><p><span style="">Hue hue hue!</span></p><p><span style="">He was so happy that a silly laugh automatically came out of his mouth.</span></p><p><span style="">He was surprised, proud, pleased and happy.</span></p><p><span style="">The fact that made him happy above all else was the reality that his enemies were frightened and scared of him.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;The only thing left is to crush them.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">Thirty great guilds.</span></p><p><span style="">The beings he hated the most couldn&apos;t rashly move against him. &#xA0;Every time they harbored hatred for the Hahoe Mask, he would extract a fair cost.</span></p><p><span style="">Moreover, they would feel a much steeper penalty for messing with him than before.</span></p><p><span style="">Ahn-jaehyun started drawing within his head. &#xA0;He drew out the future he wanted to see.</span></p><p><span style="">He first drew the scene where the Hahoe Mask put his foot down on the 30 great guilds.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Yes. &#xA0;I&apos;ll grind them up into....&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">He would step on them, and he envisioned himself standing above them.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;I&apos;ll become the best, and it&apos;ll all be mine....&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">They would be his stepping stone, and he imagined what would happen after he stood above all of them.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;I&apos;ll become the best, and&#xB7;&#xB7;&#xB7;&#xB7;&#xB7;&#xB7;.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">He&apos;ll rise above them, and.....</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hmm.&#x201D;</span></p><p>6.</p><p><span style="">As he was drawing the picture within his mind, he glanced at the capsule coffee machine.</span></p><p><span style="">When Hyrkan succeeded in the Anugas Raid, the Black Continent started to go through a significant amount of change.</span></p><p><span style="">[The Ruins of the Heard Fortress was released!] </span></p><p><span style="">[Black Continent&apos;s First Rest Area has Appeared!] </span></p><p><span style="">[Challenge the Black Continent!] </span></p><p><span style="">The biggest change was the appearance of the Heard Fortress.</span></p><p><span style="">When Anugas was deposed, the captured souls of the Ruined Kingdom&apos;s warriors were freed. &#xA0;They started circulating around the ruins, and the Subjugation Association sent NPCs to research the phenomena.</span></p><p><span style="">This was how a town was created near the ruins of the Heard fortress, and at the same time, the NPCs started giving out various quests.</span></p><p><span style="">The Quests were like road signs. &#xA0;Up until now, the Users were milling about without having any definite tasks to accomplish. &#xA0;Therefore, the Quests were like finding sweet water that ended their thirst.</span></p><p><span style="">On top of all of that, a cube capable of Item Production was installed in the town, and a Item Storage facility also came into being.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I use the Wyverns to haul my Items. &#xA0;This is why my wares are expensive.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">A new NPC accompanied by five enormous Wyverns appeared, and the Users rejoiced at its appearance. &#xA0;Then the Ingredient Coins and Gems obtained from the Black Continent finally hit the market.</span></p><p><span style="">The Items above level 200 were produced quickly, and these Items started filling up the market.</span></p><p><span style="">In many ways, the Users that had been most daring in this environment had been the Stormhunters guild, and they were also the first ones to push forward.</span></p><p><span style="">[The Stormhunters guild was the first to enter the Ravine!] </span></p><p><span style="">[Stormhunters guild has released the footage of battles conducted within the Ravine!] </span></p><p><span style="">[The Stormhunters guild has revealed their Quests. &#xA0;&apos;Our next destination is the Balos ruins, and the Olbrid forest. &#xA0;It is our main goal to push past these locations. &#xA0;We&apos;ll be the main protagonist instead of the Hahoe Mask.&#x2019;] </span></p><p><span style="">When the Anugas Raid ended, the Stormhunters unexpectedly threw themselves towards the Ravine.</span></p><p><span style="">After the Anugas Raid came to an end, the Hahoe Mask had to take a break to relieve his exhaustion. &#xA0;Then Hyrkan had to secretly go meet the Blacksmith Olf for the production of the Anugas&apos; necklace. &#xA0;He received the production Quest, and he had to move to various regions to gather all the Quest ingredients. &#xA0;The Stormhunters guild once again took the lead position.</span></p><p><span style="">As if they abhorred the idea of falling behind the Stormhunters guild, the other members of the Big 3 started to release news about their gains and achievements.</span></p><p><span style="">[The Red Bulls Guild found the Lost Island in the south!] </span></p><p><span style="">[Hydra Guild has started exploration of the Hell Cave in the west!] </span></p><p><span style="">It was the Red Bulls and Hydra guild.</span></p><p><span style="">After the Immoral Prince episode ended, there was no events that could be pointed out as being a signature achievement for the two guilds. &#xA0;However, while everyone&apos;s attention was focused on the Black Continent located on the other side of the Urugal mountain, they headed towards a location far from the interests of the other Users. &#xA0;One headed south, and the other headed west.</span></p><p><span style="">The Stormhunters guild conquered the Urugal mountain range in the north. &#xA0;The Hahoe Mask conquered the Frozen Kingdom in the East. &#xA0;The two guild wanted to achieve something similar, so they headed south and west. &#xA0;They wanted to conquer something unknown. &#xA0;This was a gamble made by these two guilds, and now it was proving to be the winning move.</span></p><p><span style="">Of course, the world was surprised by their news.</span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan was taken aback by the news. </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Lost Island? &#xA0;Hell Cave?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;This is nuts. &#xA0;Those regions are supposed to be released in the latter half of the Ruined Kingdom? &#xA0;Why now?&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">Lost Island and the Hell Cave.</span></p><p><span style="">From Hyrkan&apos;s memories, the two locations appeared near the end of the Ruined Kingdom episode. &#xA0;It was the stages that set up the 4th Main Scenario Quest called the Dragon&apos;s Army.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Will these places also give Mythos rank Ancient Power? &#xA0;Will it?&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">At the same time, he dug through his memories. &#xA0;He remembered that the Ancient Power of Darkness and Light could be earned at those locations. </span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;No, it&apos;s a guarantee that it&apos;ll show up there. &#xA0;It came out in the Frozen Kingdom and the Urugal mountain range, so it should....&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">The world was changing by the hour.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;This game has gone nuts. &#xA0;Why would it make sense to pour out all the Mythos Rank Ancient Power at once?&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">When the Item he wanted the most was completed, Hyrkan started running full tilt on a stage that was completely different from what he remembered. &#xA0;</span></p><p>7.</p><p><span style="">&#x201C;The power of the gem is dangerous. &#xA0;Please use it with discretion. &#xA0;If you aren&apos;t careful, you might push the world towards its ruin.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan was now familiar with the face in front of him. &#xA0;The Blacksmith Olf spoke as he passed over a necklace embedded with a thumbnail-sized diamond. &#xA0;Hyrkan carefully took the necklace.</span></p><p><span style="">[You&apos;ve gained the Anugas&apos; Necklace.] </span></p><p><span style="">When Hyrkan fondled the necklace, the Item Option popped up on top as a holographic window.</span></p><p><span style="">[Anugas&apos; Necklace] </span></p><p><span style="">*Main Properties</span></p><p><span style="">- Epic Rank Item</span></p><p><span style="">- All Stats +188 </span></p><p><span style="">- Class related Stats +222 </span></p><p><span style="">&#x2013; Required Level : level 200</span></p><p><span style="">*Sub-properties</span></p><p><span style="">- When equipped, 10% increase in health </span></p><p><span style="">- When equipped, 10% increase in magic</span></p><p><span style="">- When equipped, 10% increase in movement speed</span></p><p><span style="">- When equipped, 10% increase in all damage </span></p><p><span style="">- When equipped, damage received is decreased by 10%</span></p><p><span style="">- When equipped, cool time is decreased by 10% </span></p><p><span style="">- The magic and stamina consumed when using a Skill is decreased by 35%</span></p><p><span style="">- This Item cannot be damaged.</span></p><p><span style="">*Miscellaneous</span></p><p><span style="">This necklace holds the power of the Ancient Weapon Anguas. &#xA0;It holds the power of its eye. It&apos;ll allow the wearer&apos;s ability to be brought out to a fearsome level.</span></p><p><span style="">The necklace had a filthy amount of Options, and these were the most desired Options. &#xA0;Hyrkan let out a sigh of satisfaction as he looked at the Anugas&apos; Necklace.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hooo.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">After catching Anugas, it took him 5 days to complete the Anugas&apos; Necklace production Quest.</span></p><p><span style="">The tasks he had accomplished flashed before his eyes. &#xA0;Then he started to think about the memories from his distant past.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;I can&apos;t believe I&apos;ve obtained it.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan thought about the first time he came up with the ridiculous idea of making an All Strength Necromancer. &#xA0;He had to come up with with a way to make up the much needed magical energy. &#xA0;He remembered going around in ridiculous getups.</span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan had come up with the idea during that time. &#xA0;If he had an Item similar to Anugas&apos; Necklace, he wouldn&apos;t have worried about lacking magical energy.</span></p><p><span style="">However, at the time, he never even considered the fact that he would be able to obtain such an Item. &#xA0;This was why he never made plans assuming that he&apos;ll have such an Item.</span></p><p><span style="">However, he now had the Anugas&apos; necklace. &#xA0;Hyrkan had considered it to be a unreachable star in the sky. &#xA0;He had thought it was something he would never be able to catch, yet this star was shining brightly within Hyrkan&apos;s grasp.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;How much will I be able to get if I sell this?&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">Afterwards, he thought about it in terms of materialistic value.</span></p><p><span style="">It was inevitable. &#xA0;Anugas&apos; Necklace wasn&apos;t a bound Item. &#xA0;It could be traded, and the required level was only level 200. &#xA0;If one considered the Options, it could be used even when one became level 300 or even 400.</span></p><p><span style="">Then there was the fact that Warlord contained rich Users willingly to pay ridiculous amounts of money for Items. &#xA0;These people were so rich that they didn&apos;t know what to do with all their money.</span></p><p><span style="">Currently, there was the original owner of the name Rich Lich named Himala playing this game. &#xA0;Then there was the original owner of Anugas&apos; Necklace named Mateo Walker. &#xA0;He wasn&apos;t as rich as Himala, but he would gladly pay any price for this Item. &#xA0;They would easily spend several hundred thousand dollars for it.</span></p><p><span style="">It would be able to turn anyone&apos;s life around. &#xA0;Basically, one could easily buy a building by selling this Item.</span></p><p><span style="">Of course, Hyrkan&apos;s thoughts didn&apos;t end there.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;If I equip the Deposed Prince&apos;s Sword, Anugas&apos; Necklace and the Secret Society Ring...&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">If he used the Deposed Prince&apos;s Sword, and the Anugas&apos; necklace, he could reduce his magical energy consumption of his Skills by 60%. &#xA0;What if he put on the Token of the Secret Society, which increased magical recovery by 20%? &#xA0;This would be combined with the 10% increase in magic by the Anugas&apos; Necklace.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;In reality, the combined effect will reduce my magic consumption by 70%.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">It was well over half! </span></p><p><span style="">With those Options as background, he could once again eat expensive consumable Items like he was chewing gum.</span></p><p><span style="">He would no longer feel the lack of magical energy he felt after he gained the Power of Frost.</span></p><p><span style="">Instead, he had magical energy to spare.</span></p><p><span style="">Now he just had to invest in Skills that he couldn&apos;t purchase, because he didn&apos;t have enough magical energy to spare.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;I&apos;ll have to burn through Skill Books to obtain the [Conductor] skill. &#xA0;Then the page of Ancient Power I have.... &#xA0;It&apos;ll be fine if I use it on the [Skeleton Knight] rather than the [Golem Summon].&apos;</span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan decided to invest in his Skeleton Knight.</span></p>
