<p>Chapter 177 &#x2013; Red Desert (4)</p><p>10</p><p><span style="">There was a big hole. &#xA0;The big hole had a diameter of 20 meters. &#xA0;It was inadequate to simply call it a hole. &#xA0;It was big enough to call it a chasm.</span></p><p><span style="">The four Users were speechless as they looked at the entrance.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Uh&#x2026;...&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan, who had the experience of going through all sorts of hardships, was first to open his mouth after he came to his senses.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;So shall we head in?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Both the Quest Content and the Gem Conch is telling us to go in.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Whistling answered Hyrkan. &#xA0;At that moment, Yojori and Joba was still unable to come to their senses. &#xA0;They vacantly looked at the hole. &#xA0;Yojori, who always chirped aloud, had her mouth shut as she stared at the intimidating hole.</span></p><p><span style="">Of course, the size wasn&#x2019;t the only reason why they were awed and intimidated.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Crazy. &#xA0;You saw what happened earlier!&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan&#x2019;s party hadn&#x2019;t become intimidated by the hole. &#xA0;It had to do with the being that had made the hole.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Mmmm.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">At Hyrkan&#x2019;s words, the four of them thought about what happened earlier&#x2026;. &#xA0;&#xA0;It was around three minutes ago.</span></p><p><span style="">While everyone was clicking their tongue in amazement, Hyrkan spoke out loud to organize his memories..</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;The snake from earlier&#x2026;. &#xA0;It sounds like a misnomer to call it a snake. &#xA0;Anyways, you guys all saw the 10 stories long monster?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">They had arrived at their destination by following the Gem Conch, and a stone monument was waiting for Hyrkan&#x2019;s party. &#xA0;&#xA0;Of course, the stone monument was weathered, so there was nothing on it. &#xA0;The four of them stood on top of the stone monument with a vacant expression on their faces. &#xA0;Whistling put the Gem Conch to his ear, and it said to head downwards.</span></p><p><span style="">Everyone let out some choice words at this direction.</span></p><p><span style="">Did they have to dig up the ground?</span></p><p><span style="">However, the Red Desert couldn&#x2019;t be dug out.</span></p><p><span style="">They couldn&#x2019;t do it&#x2026;. </span></p><p><span style="">Their complaints were along that line.</span></p><p><span style="">Koo koo koo! </span></p><p><span style="">At that moment, a large sound was heard, and an earthquake could be felt. &#xA0;The ground started to crack, so everyone decided to retreat for now. &#xA0;The ground cracked as it sunk. &#xA0;An enormous snake erupted out of the ground when everyone was clear of the stone monument. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan, who had pretty much experienced everything within this game, dumbly stared at the majestic mammoth of a snake. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">The snake quickly disappeared back into the ground as soon as it appeared.</span></p><p><span style="">Since then, the situation remained the same.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I&#x2019;m sure of it. &#xA0;The Gem Conch wants us to go in there.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Everyone wanted Whistling to listen to the Gem Conch again. &#xA0;For reference, this was the seventh time they had asked him to do this. &#xA0;Still, Whistling hadn&#x2019;t kept count, but he continued to put the Gem Conch to his ear. &#xA0;Whistling was also dazed at what had just happened.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Uh whew.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan let out a long sigh.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;This is nuts.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">It wasn&#x2019;t as if the situation was totally unbelievable. &#xA0;This was a game. &#xA0;The large snake had appeared, and it had made a hole. &#xA0;The hole led to some other location. &#xA0;This wasn&#x2019;t out of the realm of possibility of what one would face in a game. &#xA0;It was actually a very cool setting.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;If that snake is the boss monster&#x2026;. &#xA0;Will I be able to kill it?&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">The problem arose if they would have to kill the large snake from earlier. &#xA0;This particular game was sadistic enough to make them confront and kill the snake. &#xA0;At that point, this would turn from being a cool setting to being a horrible setting.</span></p><p><span style="">Even Hyrkan couldn&#x2019;t imagine himself fighting this snake.</span></p><p><span style="">This was why everyone had a vacant expression on their faces.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I&#x2019;ll go in first.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Whistling was able to somewhat pull himself together, so he volunteered to be the sacrificial lamb. &#xA0;Hyrkan turned to look at Whistling.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;This hole isn&#x2019;t an Instance Dungeon. One person can go scout and come back. &#xA0;If there is a problem, one could run back here.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ah. &#xA0;Then I&#x2019;ll go in first.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;No way. &#xA0;I should go in. &#xA0;A Crusader has a higher chance of surviving.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Yojori and Joba was finally able to open their mouths, and they each offered to be the sacrificial lamb. &#xA0;They spoke about it as if it was their duty.</span></p><p><span style="">On the other hand, the Hahoe Mask acted different from them. &#xA0;He became surprised at their words, and at the same time, he fell into a dilemma.</span></p><p><span style="">He was afraid. </span></p><p><span style="">He calculated the cost associated with his Game Over. &#xA0;He used simplified figures for his calculations. &#xA0;When he arrived at a figure, he clamped his mouth shut.</span></p><p><span style="">He didn&#x2019;t like the number he had arrived at, &#xA0;and at the same time, he didn&#x2019;t like the fact that he was weighing only his own interests.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;When did I&#x2026;..&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">The Hero Slaughterer didn&#x2019;t use to make such calculations. &#xA0;The only thing the Hero Slaughterer &#xA0;cared about was whether he was going to kill an opponent or not. &#xA0;His calculations revolved around the methods needed to kill the ones that deserved to be killed. &#xA0;That was it. </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hoo-ooh.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan let out a long sigh.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;If we are set on this plan, I&#x2019;ll go in.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">The three of them reacted to his words. &#xA0;Before they could speak, Hyrkan gave an explanation.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Even if a lesser monster comes out, the only one that could defeat it would be me.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan was right. &#xA0;If it wasn&#x2019;t for him, they wouldn&#x2019;t have been able to reach this location. &#xA0;The Red Desert was a burdensome stage even for Hyrkan. &#xA0;If a goblin appeared here, the three of them would be hard pressed to kill it. &#xA0;This game was like that.</span></p><p><span style="">At his words, the three Users nodded their heads.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Then we can all go in together.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yeah. &#xA0;We can do that.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Instead of giving an answer, Whistling turned to look at Hyrkan. &#xA0;Hyrkan was still thinking over the decision.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;It isn&#x2019;t an Instant Dungeon&#x2026; &#xA0;If things go sideway, we can run away. &#xA0;Yes, that&#x2019;s what we&#x2019;ll do. &#xA0;I&#x2019;ll just use the Golems to buy time. &#xA0;If we keep a sharp mind, we&#x2019;ll be able to survive even if we all go into the tiger&#x2019;s cave.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">Whistling looked at Hyrkan as his eyes became bleary.</span></p><p>11.</p><p><span style="">[You&#x2019;ve enter the Den of the Rebels.] </span></p><p><span style="">[You&#x2019;ve acquired the title &#x2018;Visitor of the Den of Rebels&#x2019;.] </span></p><p><span style="">[You&#x2019;ve acquired the title &#x2018;Inheritor of the Ruined Kingdom&#x2019;s Will.]] </span></p><p><span style="">[You&#x2019;ve acquired the title &#x2018;One who saw the Mirage Snake&#x2019;.] </span></p><p><span style="">The Mirage Snake had made this large hole, and the four Users slid down the tunnel like a water slide. &#xA0;They were instantly greeted with three presents. &#xA0;Three out of the four Users immediately marvelled at what they had received.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Rebels&#x2026;. &#xA0;It sounds nice.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;If this is the Den of the Rebel, then the Quest Man was correct. &#xA0;This scenario is set up as he had predicted.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I don&#x2019;t care about that. &#xA0;I just want Elves to come out and greet me.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Crazy son of a bitch.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Even I think my words were a little bit too much. &#xA0;Anyways, the Mirage Snake&#x2026; &#xA0;Wasn&#x2019;t it awesome?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I agree. &#xA0;A large snake made this tunnel. &#xA0;It was very cool.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">On the other hand, the remaining User was unlatching his wristwatch instead of looking over his presents.</span></p><p><span style="">[Item Slot Change Mode is unavailable now.] </span></p><p><span style="">He gripped the wrist watch, which he had slipped off. &#xA0;A darkness flowed out from the wristwatch to make a door.</span></p><p><span style="">[Death Knight was Summoned.] </span></p><p><span style="">A Death Knight appeared within the dark tunnel.</span></p><p><span style="">[Special Skill &#x2018;Commander&#x2019; was activated.] </span></p><p><span style="">Nine Skeleton Warriors, two Skeleton Magicians and a Skeleton Knight appeared alongside the Death Knight.</span></p><p><span style="">[Bone Armor was summoned.] </span></p><p><span style="">[Madness Helm was summoned.] </span></p><p><span style="">As if the summoning wasn&#x2019;t enough, all kinds of Skills armed the Skeleton unit again. The Bone Armor surrounded the Skeletons, and a horn grew on their heads. &#xA0;Moreover, all kinds of Curses was added on to their weapons.</span></p><p><span style="">[Life Vessel was activated.] </span></p><p><span style="">At the end, Hyrkan activated the Life Vessel Skill.</span></p><p><span style="">He optimized himself for survival, and when he finished all his preparations, he was prepared to slip into his fighting mode at any moment.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hoo-ooh.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">His sigh came out as if to harden his resolve.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;All right. &#xA0;Let&#x2019;s move.&#x201D;</span></p><p>12.</p><p><span style="">The Death Knight rode the Skeleton Steed as it took the lead. &#xA0;The Skeleton Knight, Warriors. and Magicians followed behind it. &#xA0;Hyrkan&#x2019;s group was in the rear. &#xA0;It was an exaggeration to say that they were in the rear. &#xA0;Hyrkan&#x2019;s party was as far as they could be with the Death Knight and its cohort.</span></p><p><span style="">The distance between the two groups was quite large.</span></p><p><span style="">However, Hyrkan wasn&#x2019;t satisfied even after putting that much distance with the advance group. &#xA0;He kept vigilant of his surrounding.</span></p><p><span style="">He was actually too vigilant.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;We&#x2019;ll lead from the front.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">It was so bad that Yojori and Joba stepped forward to intervene.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;It is too dangerous.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;At worst, we&#x2019;ll die. &#xA0;We can live with that.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">From their perspective, Hyrkan was being overly cautious.</span></p><p><span style="">They didn&#x2019;t enjoy a Game Over, but from their perspective, they were willing to risk a Game Over if needed. &#xA0;It was an option they were willing to choose.</span></p><p><span style="">On the other hand, Hyrkan valued survival over everything else, and he acted accordingly.</span></p><p><span style="">However, Hyrkan&#x2019;s vigilance was eating away at their time. &#xA0;Up until now, Hyrkan had moved at break speed when he committed to fighting. &#xA0;However, Hyrkan was now moving at the slowest speed setting that could be travelled by the Skeleton army.</span></p><p><span style="">This was why they moved only 3 kilometers, yet it took them an hour.</span></p><p><span style="">Moreover, the tunnel made one feel ashamed for being so vigilant. &#xA0;It was called the Den of the Rebels, but until they found the ruined underground city, they hadn&#x2019;t run across anything dangerous. &#xA0;Not a single battle was fought.. </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Wow!&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;This is amazing.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What is it? &#xA0;Where is the light coming from?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;There. &#xA0;I think something is over there. &#xA0;The ceiling is really high. &#xA0;Isn&#x2019;t this as big as a domed baseball stadium?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Unexpectedly, this place is pretty clean. &#xA0;I have a hard time calling it a ruin. &#xA0;I don&#x2019;t think this place suffered any attacks. &#xA0;It was just abandoned.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">When the underground city was found, Yojori and Joba couldn&apos;t hold themselves back. &#xA0;They started running around to satisfy their curiosity.</span></p><p><span style="">On the other hand, Hyrkan was still tense.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Where is it?&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">They had basically followed a path left behind by the snake. &#xA0;He got ready to fight a battle with the snake. &#xA0;It might occur at any moment.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Where did it go?&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">Whistling intruded into the feeling of tenseness felt by Hyrkan.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Maybe, this is because I haven&#x2019;t seen you in awhile. &#xA0;However, you are really make this game boring.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan replied reflexively. &#xA0;Hyrkan&#x2019;s question held a sharp edge to it. &#xA0;However, Whistling wasn&#x2019;t someone, who would back down, because he heard some sharp words.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;When we met last time, you grumbled a lot, but you seemed to be enjoying yourself playing this game.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What are you trying to say?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Instead of giving an immediate answer, Whistling thought over his answer. &#xA0;He organized his thoughts and feelings he had, since he met up with Hyrkan for this Quest. &#xA0;After he thought through everything, he gave his answer.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Each person has their own reason for playing this game, and I don&#x2019;t care what that reason is. &#xA0;However, one&#x2019;s action should match one&#x2019;s motivation to play this game.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">This was a bit of an exaggeration, but Whistling had seen the Hahoe Mask as a gamer sent by the gods. &#xA0;He was a warrior sent by the gods to see if he could reach the end of Warlord. </span></p><p><span style="">He was akin to a warrior of a god! </span></p><p><span style="">In reality, Hyrkan created results that far exceeded his talents. &#xA0;He didn&#x2019;t give up when confronted with difficulties. &#xA0;If there was a dead end, he used all methods available to him to pave a path forward. &#xA0;Even if it was a battle considered to be impossible, he put his life on the line to drag himself to victory.</span></p><p><span style="">Hahoe Mask was that kind of a User. &#xA0;The battle footages that was popular on youtube was the evidence. &#xA0;He could just order his powerful Skeleton Underlings to do everything, yet he didn&#x2019;t hesitate to throw himself into the mix even at the risk to himself. &#xA0;He led from the front to bring about victory.</span></p><p><span style="">Even though he was the Hahoe Mask, he hadn&#x2019;t shown any aversion for the possibility of a Game Over. &#xA0;He hadn&#x2019;t shown fear of the risk that came with a Game Over. &#xA0;If one looked at the footages of the Hahoe Mask, he had always believed what he did was worth the risk of a Game Over. &#xA0;He fought despite the risks.</span></p><p><span style="">However, the current Hahoe Mask was different from the one from before.</span></p><p><span style="">There was a difference&#x2026;. &#xA0;&#xA0;Others couldn&#x2019;t tell the difference. &#xA0;However, Whistling had the closest seat in viewing Hyrkan from before and after the change. &#xA0;Moreover, he considered himself to be a friend of Hyrkan, so Whistling was aware of this change.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;If your aim is to earn money, you should act as if this is a business. &#xA0;You should play as if you are playing for the audiences that&#x2019;ll give you money.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Since Whistling thought of Hyrkan as a friend, he brought up this subject.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;If your goal is to achieve the highest level, you should play the game more efficiently. &#xA0;You shouldn&#x2019;t be here. &#xA0;You should kill Wood Devils or monsters of that ilk to give it your all in leveling up. &#xA0;If you want to become famous, you should do something controversial. &#xA0;You can challenge one of the 30 great guilds.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Whistling thought of Hyrkan as a friend. &#xA0;He had thought he had made an amazing friend in an amazing world within a game!</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;If you are aiming to complete the Main Scenario Quest, you should adjust your attitude accordingly.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">If he didn&#x2019;t think of Hyrkan as a friend, Whistling wouldn&#x2019;t have spoken this many words.</span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan didn&#x2019;t even let out a sigh at Whistling&#x2019;s words. </span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan felt conflicted. &#xA0;Whistling left Hyrkan alone. &#xA0;He didn&#x2019;t want to pile on more stuff on top of an already conflicted Hyrkan.</span></p><p><span style="">The thoughts that weighed upon Hyrkan&#x2019;s mind deepened.</span></p><p>13.</p><p><span style="">There had been no battles.</span></p><p><span style="">There had been no enemies inside the Den of Rebels. &#xA0;There were no allies either. &#xA0;It was just a remnant left behind by the distant past. &#xA0;Hyrkan&#x2019;s party used the Gem Conch to find the Artifacts left behind by the owner of the Den of Rebels.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I&#x2019;ve located the boxes. &#xA0;There are three of them.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">There was a grave made out of rocks within the underground city. &#xA0;Underneath the stone grave, three boxes were found. &#xA0;They found a red, black and green colored boxes. </span></p><p><span style="">The red box had one scroll, and the black box held three scrolls. &#xA0;The green box couldn&#x2019;t be opened.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;So this is it?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes. &#xA0;I&#x2019;ve seen it before.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Whistling&#x2019;s party immediately guessed what was within the green box.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;It probably holds a Record Tree seed. &#xA0;I&#x2019;ve seen similar boxes near the Record Tree.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;It is an amazing Artifact.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">When Whistling took the green box, Whistling and his party heard a Quest Announcement. &#xA0;Their Quest Content had just changed. &#xA0;They had to deliver the green box to the Red Elves.</span></p><p><span style="">On the other hand, Hyrkan&#x2019;s Quest Content didn&#x2019;t change at all. &#xA0;There were no new System Announcement. &#xA0;Unlike his expectation, his Elven Kingdom&#x2019;s Artifact was elsewhere.</span></p><p><span style="">However, Hyrkan didn&#x2019;t get discouraged. &#xA0;He didn&#x2019;t throw a tantrum. &#xA0;He just looked at his surrounding.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;It&#x2019;s clean.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">He looked at the unblemished Bone Armor on his Skeletons. &#xA0;When he saw this sight, he felt silly for being worried, tense, and wary. &#xA0;These emotions had been sucking his blood dry.</span></p><p><span style="">His actions up until now looked ridiculous in hindsight.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;I was a scaredy-cat.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">He had flopped around like a scared coward.</span></p><p><span style="">Whistling was right.</span></p><p><span style="">When he returned to the past, he had prior knowledge, which allowed him to gain rewards. &#xA0;These rewards were set in stone, and he had nothing to lose. &#xA0;This certainty was the reason why he had thrown himself at every obstacles he encountered.</span></p><p><span style="">However, this wasn&#x2019;t true any more. &#xA0;Everything he faced was shrouded by the unknown, and he had a lot to lose now.</span></p><p><span style="">In the past, he always walked on that fine line where a slip up would result in a Game Over. &#xA0;He had enjoyed walking this fine line within this game. &#xA0;Now he was avoiding such situations at all cost. &#xA0;He was only filled with wariness now.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;I thought it was bullshit when people said a person&#x2019;s position maketh the man. &#xA0;Jeez&#x2026;.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">He had been in self-denial.</span></p><p><span style="">Why did Hyrkan become a Necromancer? &#xA0;Did he become one, because he wanted to order around the Skeletons for his convenience?</span></p><p><span style="">No. &#xA0;He wanted to make a stage where the Hero Slaughterer would thrive. &#xA0;Skeletons were merely distractions to draw the aggro. &#xA0;They were supposed to be used to set up a stage where Hyrkan would be able take on the most difficult opponent. &#xA0;He never wanted the Skeletons and Golems to make this game easy.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;What I wanted to do&#x2026; &#xA0;At the very least, this isn&#x2019;t it.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan gritted his teeth. &#xA0;The tail end of his lips drooped.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What is the status of your Quest?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Whistling queried Hyrkan.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;My Quest hasn&#x2019;t changed at all.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;You should come with us just in case. &#xA0;Why don&#x2019;t you visit the town of the Red Elves with us to deliver the Record Tree seed?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;No. &#xA0;You guys should complete your Quest. &#xA0;There is only one of that Item. &#xA0;If you lose it, you&#x2019;ll never be unable to finish this Quest.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Still&#x2026;..&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I&#x2019;m sure our Quests are related. &#xA0;If you progress in your Quest to the next stage, I&#x2019;m sure I&#x2019;ll receive a clue for my Quest too. &#xA0;You should take care of your own business first. &#xA0;I can confirm it afterwards.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan continued to speak.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Moreover, I have something I have to do. &#xA0;I have to cross the Urugal mountain range. &#xA0;I&#x2019;m not in &#xA0;a hurry. &#xA0;You go do your thing.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan cleanly gave up on the idea of traveling with them. &#xA0;Yojori and Joba looked at him with anxious eyes. &#xA0;They were truly worried for him. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan had put a lot of effort into this venture for them, yet Hyrkan basically had to kick an empty can down the road.</span></p><p><span style="">Instead of speaking unnecessary words, Whistling lightly kicked the red box towards Hyrkan.</span></p><p><span style="">Toohk! </span></p><p><span style="">The red box came to a stop next to Hyrkan&#x2019;s foot.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I can&#x2019;t send you back with empty hands. You should keep the Legendary Rank Ancient Power.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">At those words, Hyrkan nodded his head.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;All right. &#xA0;We have enough where everyone will get something. &#xA0;There are three Transcendent Rank Ancient Power scrolls, so you guys should divvy it up amongst yourselves. &#xA0;Or do you want to sell it to me?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What price do you have in mind?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;How about 100,000 gold each?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">When the 100,000 gold was mentioned, Yojori and Joba&#x2019;s face was filled with surprise. &#xA0;Whistling&#x2019;s expression hardened.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;You are basically wanting it for free.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Instead, I&#x2019;ll kill all the Sand Snakes we encounter on the way back. &#xA0;I&#x2019;ll help you guys level up, and you guys can keep the Ingredient Coins as souvenirs. &#xA0;Since we are friends, you should give me a discount.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Finally, Whistling expression finally softened. </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Since we are friends, we have to make sure the deal is fair. &#xA0;I want 200,000 gold.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">On the other hand, Hyrkan&#x2019;s expression hardened.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hey. &#xA0;Do you think 200,000 gold is&#x2026;.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Circlet of Purification.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#xB7;&#xB7;&#xB7;&#xB7;&#xB7;&#xB7;I guess I can do that. &#xA0;What about you two? &#xA0;What do you guys want to do?&#x201D;</span></p>
