<p><span style="">Chapter 137 - If You Set It on Fire, Blessings Will Come Your Way (1)</span></p><p>1.</p><p><span style="">- Huh? &#xA0;It ended? &#xA0;Did we catch them all? &#xA0;Huh? &#xA0;Maeung? &#xA0;What the hell?</span></p><p><span style="">The footage ended after 3 seconds. &#xA0;The footage faded out as if it was a mirage. &#xA0;Then two Users appeared afterwards.</span></p><p><span style="">It was Amohng and Ken. &#xA0;These two characters were known to have the most popular Warlord-related Ranking show, and their lips were twitching. &#xA0;It was as if they were trying to suppress their laughter.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;&#x2026;if we have to pick the best scene of the year, I&apos;ll pick this scene without hesitation.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Pfffft! </span></p><p><span style="">As Ahmong was speaking, Ken couldn&apos;t help, but let out a laugh. &#xA0;Ahmong followed his example. &#xA0;He started to laugh too.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Don&apos;t be like this, Ken. &#xA0;I&apos;m barely holding it back.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I&apos;m sorry. &#xA0;Ah. &#xA0;It really is funny. &#xA0;I&apos;m not saying the scene itself is funny. &#xA0;The situation itself was so ridiculous that I couldn&apos;t help, but laugh.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;It happens sometimes. &#xA0;An event is so absurd that it is funny. &#xA0;Did you watch it live, Ken?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Of course, I saw it live. &#xA0;I was frozen for a brief moment when I saw this scene.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">They exchanged some words, and they were able to regain their cool. &#xA0;After they let out an appropriate amount of laughter, they continued their conversation.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;In many ways, it was a very memorable scene. &#xA0;There are some, who think the scene was staged as an attempt to put his name in the headlines. &#xA0;What do you think, Ken?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;If this scene was really done on purpose, the Hahoe Mask should immediately take off his Hahoe Mask, and he should go straight to Hollywood. &#xA0;If so, maybe we&apos;ll see him in the Oscars next year. &#xA0;Even Al Pacino couldn&apos;t pull off this kind of acting.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Well, we&apos;ll immediately start our Ranking Show. First, let us check who came in 1st in the Paid Video Sales category. &#xA0;The owner of the first place is....&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">- Huh? &#xA0;It ended? &#xA0;Did we catch them all? &#xA0;Huh? &#xA0;Maeung? &#xA0;What the hell? </span></p><p><span style="">In a flash, the 3 second video was replayed again.</span></p><p><span style="">Pffft!</span></p><p><span style="">Ken once again let out a laugh. &#xA0;Ahmohng kept poking at Ken&apos;s side. &#xA0;Afterwards, Ken was barely able to read his lines.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes. The hero who earned 1st place by recording a sales of 101 million is the Hahoe Mask in the Immoral Prince Raid.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">At that moment, Ahn-jaehyun was watching Ahmong and Ken&apos;s Ranking show, and he was massaging his eyes with his two hands. &#xA0;He wasn&apos;t massaging his eyes from being tired.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;This is driving me nuts.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">This shameful clip was something he wanted to forget, but it was being replayed in front of millions of people. The hands over his eyes were also a method to avoid looking at the replay. &#xA0;Of course, it was a preposterous way to avoid looking at it.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Shit. &#xA0;Of all the things....&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">At that moment, Ahn-jaehyun once again reminisced on what had happened.</span></p><p><span style="">Maeung&#x2019;s appearance had been foretold. &#xA0;Although, it was a bit of a surprise that Maeung chose to end the Immoral Prince. &#xA0;It was a scenario where he had expected Maeung to show up when the Immoral Prince was close to death. &#xA0;He had expected Maeung to give a clue about the ruined kingdom. </span></p><p><span style="">However, he never expected Maeung to search out the Hahoe Mask after it finished its business.</span></p><p><span style="">No, he didn&apos;t have the mental capacity to worry about such a thing. &#xA0;The Immoral Prince Raid had been very hard, but Ahn-jaehyun had been close to his limit even before the Raid. &#xA0;To face the Immoral Prince, he had to reach level 180 as fast as possible.</span></p><p><span style="">Moreover, he had wanted to work in secret behind the Red Bulls, so he had stopped receiving help from the Red Bulls&apos; level up support team. &#xA0;Afterwards, he hadn&apos;t had time to rest. &#xA0;When he reached level 180, he had to recover the Items he had put in Item Storage. &#xA0;His personal attention was also needed for coming up with the Item Setting he would enter the Immoral Prince Raid with. &#xA0;He also had to check each of the Item Setting of his Skeleton subordinates. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">The Hahoe Mask&apos;s goofy response was an appropriate reaction. &#xA0;It was a great feat in itself that he hadn&apos;t logged out by falling asleep.</span></p><p><span style="">However, no one was aware of his situation. &#xA0;The world thought the Hahoe Mask was talking in a half-asleep state at the most important moment in the Raid. &#xA0;Still, people focused on it, and they really enjoyed that scene.</span></p><p><span style="">Ahn-jaehyun&apos;s gibberish from his lack of sleep had already hit the Warlord related fan sites, and it was being circulated as an animated gif. &#xA0;Moreover, the footage appeared in any article, interview or video related to the Immoral Prince raid.</span></p><p><span style="">There were even some Users in Warlord that used the word &apos;Huh Maeung&apos; instead of saying a greeting or thanks. &#xA0;If things turned out unfavorably, Ahn-jaehyun&apos;s shameful past had a chance of becoming a part of the lexicon of Warlord.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;The image I built up until now was destroyed, because of a short 3 seconds clip.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">Hahoe Mask.</span></p><p><span style="">He was stronger than anyone else. &#xA0;It didn&apos;t matter what trouble he was in, the Hahoe Mask solved the problem with his own strength. &#xA0;He was an extraordinary hero, yet he had become the butt of a joke in the span of a single day.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Aigo&#x2026;&#x2026;.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Ahn-jaehyun let out a moan. &#xA0;He was letting out a moan, but at the same time, it indicated that Ahn-jaehyun was full right now.</span></p><p><span style="">He had gained everything he wanted.</span></p><p><span style="">Ahn-jaehyun had earned everything he was able to earn in the Immoral Prince episode.</span></p><p><span style="">He had gained a level 200 Chronicle Epic Item. &#xA0;It was currently the strongest Item in existence. &#xA0;Moreover, there were merely 10 of these Items in circulation. &#xA0;It was the ultimate Item, and it wasn&#x2019;t something that could be bought with money.</span></p><p><span style="">He had also gained numerous Titles. &#xA0;Ahn-jaehyun had gained the two Titles he had coveted forever. &#xA0;He gained the &apos;Havan Kindom&apos;s Hero&apos; and &apos;Arbiter of Corruption&apos; Titles. &#xA0;These were precious Titles that couldn&apos;t be earned any more. &#xA0;On top of it all, he had gained the &apos;Hero of the Great Battle&apos; and &apos;Defeater of Argardo&apos; Titles....</span></p><p><span style="">He had earned a lot.</span></p><p><span style="">However, the biggest jackpot for him was the profit he received from the Paid Video Sales. The Immoral Prince Raid was seen live by over 5 million people. &#xA0;However, there were a large portion of the viewers that hadn&apos;t been satisfied with the live broadcasts. </span></p><p><span style="">It was to be expected. &#xA0;Usually, a normal live Raid broadcast needed a lot of preparation and planning. &#xA0;When preparing for a raid, one had to be mindful of where to place the cameras, and one had to know which shots looked good. &#xA0;There was a separate group of people that had to get ready for the Raid.</span></p><p><span style="">However, this Immoral Prince Raid had developed too suddenly, and everything had been rushed.</span></p><p><span style="">The appearance of the Hahoe Mask was especially a surprise. &#xA0;In such a situation, they weren&apos;t able to properly broadcast the Hahoe Mask&apos;s exploits. &#xA0;This was why a lot of people were disappointed. &#xA0;However, the Hahoe Mask had his own footage, and a video was made using his contents. Their disappointment turned into anticipation as they waited for the Hahoe Mask&apos;s version of the Raid. &#xA0;Ahn-jaehyun hadn&#x2019;t move with that much forethought, but the anticipation felt by the people was immediately proven through the number of sales.</span></p><p><span style="">In just a week, the sales of his video moved past a million!</span></p><p><span style="">In terms of Personal Paid Video Sales, the only one who had been able to sell over a million in one week was the First One. &#xA0;The Hahoe Mask was the first to achieve this feat since the First One. His revenues were incredible. &#xA0;The price for his Paid Videos was $4.99. &#xA0;Of course, the Hahoe Mask&apos;s share of the money was in the hundred thousands of dollars.</span></p><p><span style="">Ahn-jaehyun had just gained the crowning achievement one could reach in the game of Warlord. &#xA0;Currently, Ahn-jaehyun was in a far better place than the time before he returned to the past. &#xA0;He was shining brighter than the time before he had gone to war with the Stormhunters. </span></p><p><span style="">This was why he couldn&apos;t complain about this embarrassing event.</span></p><p><span style="">Ahn-jaehyun was cognizant of his situation. </span></p><p><span style="">He peeled his two hands off of his face. &#xA0;Then he put on his glasses over his slightly more relaxed eyes. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">He looked at this Tablet PC.</span></p><p><span style="">- We will be announcing the guild ranking for the 30 great guilds. &#xA0;This topic always sparks a fierce debate, so we are qualifying it beforehand. &#xA0;Ahmong and Ken&apos;s Ranking show uses 15 criteria to determine the ranking of the 30 great guilds. &#xA0;This ranking isn&apos;t an official ranking, and we aren&apos;t a credible source for such information. </span></p><p><span style="">He focused on Amohng and Ken&apos;s Ranking Show, but the light in Ahn-jaehyun&apos;s eyes was a little bit different from before.</span></p><p>2.</p><p><span style="">The end to the second Main Scenario Quest affected a lot of people. &#xA0;The people, who were interested in Warlord, became new resident of the game. &#xA0;On the other hand, there were those that had lost interest, and they left the stage called Warlord. &#xA0;Then a vital change happened regarding the 30 great guilds.</span></p><p><span style="">A crucial decision had been made.</span></p><p><span style="">This truth was acknowledged by regular Users and Warlord fans, who weren&apos;t part of the 30 guilds.</span></p><p><span style="">- Let&apos;s be real about it. &#xA0;Even if they are all called the 30 great guilds, isn&apos;t there too much internal differences amongst the guilds?</span></p><p><span style="">- I feel the same way. &#xA0;I think they should make a large scale changes to the live channel rights. &#xA0;In truth, some of the 30 great guilds don&apos;t deserve the live channel rights. &#xA0;Some of them are even worse than the Fighters guild.</span></p><p><span style="">- If you look at Amohng and Ken&apos;s RanKing show, the Fighters guild moved past the bottom of the 30 great guilds. &#xA0;They moved past the Big Smiles guild in terms of quality in their Guild Ranking.</span></p><p><span style="">- &#x3134; For real. &#xA0;In truth, does the Big Smiles guild have anyone that can fight better than Pitbull?</span></p><p><span style="">- &#x3134; Don&apos;t look down on the Big Smiles. &#xA0;They are still one of the top guilds in the 30 great guilds in terms of views.</span></p><p><span style="">- &#x3134; Their view count is inflated since China has a lot of people. &#xA0;Is that really something to be proud about? &#xA0;How many people purchase their pay-per-view videos? &#xA0;Can they even sell 500,000 live tickets any more?</span></p><p><span style="">During the Corrupt Count episode, a good number of guilds participated in the Main Scenario Quest. &#xA0;The evidence of this fact was shown when the Corrupt Count&apos;s identity was revealed in the Corrupt Count Raid. &#xA0;A large portion of the 30 great guilds was present in the Corrupt Count Raid. &#xA0;However, only three guilds had made an imprint on the Immoral Prince episode. &#xA0;Aside from these three guilds, the other 27 guilds pretty much took on the role of sidekicks. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">If so, what will happen in the 3rd Main Scenario Quest? The guilds had started to distinguish themselves from each other in the Immoral Prince episode.</span></p><p><span style="">Currently, there was the three guilds that was considered to be the Big 3. &#xA0;What did the other remaining guilds have to do now?</span></p><p><span style="">First, they couldn&apos;t avoid doing the Main Scenario Quest. &#xA0;In the Main Scenario Quest, one needed a good understanding of the game, a good information network, and monster hunting ability. &#xA0;It was the surest measuring sticking that allowed a guild to show their capability.</span></p><p><span style="">If a guild avoided doing the Main Scenario quest, one needed a sure content that&apos;ll allow a guild to be self-sufficient in its survival. &#xA0;In reality, only the Sweepers guild and the Geicoff guild was able to do this.</span></p><p><span style="">In such an environment, the V&amp;V guild was the first one to attempt a change.</span></p><p>3.</p><p><span style="">Before he connected to Warlord, Ahn-jaehyun always searched for articles related to Warlord. &#xA0;Of course, Ahn-jaehyun&apos;s attention was focused on the reorganization plan announced by the V&amp;V guild.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;What the hell is this?&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">Ahn-jaehyun knew there were going to be changes. &#xA0;He had expected it. &#xA0;If they didn&apos;t change, they would inevitably be culled. &#xA0;Ahn-jaehyun insisted on watching Amohng and Ken&apos;s Ranking Show to gather information about the public trends.</span></p><p><span style="">In fact, this had also happened before Ahn-jaehyun returned to the past. &#xA0;When the Immoral Prince episode ended, all the guilds went through an overhaul. &#xA0;It didn&apos;t matter if it was a big guild or a small guild. &#xA0;The outstanding Users were scouted, and the trading of Users between guilds, which had been considered a taboo, started to occur.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;The team name is&#x2026;&#x2026; Poker? &#xA0;Is it in reference to the card game?&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">With that in mind, the V&amp;V guild had started to consolidate the disorderly organizations under their banner. &#xA0;The guild&apos;s core power were being gathered into one team. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">However, Ahn-jaehyun didn&apos;t doubt the reasons behind their actions.</span></p><p><span style="">Instead, he was impressed by their bold initiative. &#xA0;Guilds were most definitely a for profit organization. &#xA0;If one joined and worked for a guild, one would expect personal gain in the process. If not, no one would stay in a guild.</span></p><p><span style="">Each of the 30 great guilds easily had over a thousand guild members. &#xA0;If the guild wanted to guarantee some profit for everyone, the guild had no choice, but to diversify their activities.</span></p><p><span style="">However, V&amp;V had just gave up on that. &#xA0;They had decided to focus their efforts on a single purpose. &#xA0;This would surely mean that the profit gained by the regular guild members would decrease. &#xA0;It also meant that a good number of guild members would leave the V&amp;V guild. &#xA0;They wouldn&apos;t be able to avoid internal strife. &#xA0;If this was a company, it would basically be a restructure. They were willing to go through a grinding pain, and it deserved respect. &#xA0;They were willing to go through the pain in pursuit of some unknown purpose.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Their naming sense is shitty... &#xA0;However, the content of their plan isn&apos;t bad. &#xA0;No. &#xA0;I&apos;m surprised the V&amp;V guild went through with this decision. &#xA0;I&apos;m pretty sure they weren&apos;t like this before.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">From Ahn-jaehyun&apos;s perspective, the V&amp;V guild was making the right decision. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">Red Bulls, Stormhunters, and Hydra.</span></p><p><span style="">These three guilds had become the Big 3, and these three possessed the most powerful tools. &#xA0;If one didn&apos;t have a tools that was as strong as theirs, one couldn&apos;t covet what the Big 3 owned.</span></p><p><span style="">Moreover, the Team Poker that was being formed by the V&amp;V guild was structured different from the primary Raid teams of the other guilds.</span></p><p><span style="">It was as the named indicated. &#xA0;The Poker would branch into 4 classification. &#xA0;It&apos;ll be the Spade, Heart, Clover and Diamond. &#xA0;The members will be labeled starting with Ace and it would end with King. There would be a total of 52 Users, and three Jokers would be added in. &#xA0;The final tally was a total of 55 people. &#xA0;A normal primary Raid team had between 20 to 30 members. &#xA0;The Poker were much numerous in number.</span></p><p><span style="">On the other hand, they weren&apos;t only going to do Raids. &#xA0;They would be like a swiss army knife in terms of their use in the game.</span></p><p><span style="">Ahn-jaehyun couldn&apos;t find any fault up to this point. </span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Why is there so many bastards here that I don&apos;t know?&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">The problem was the new members that were added to the newly unveiled Poker Team of the V&amp;V guild. &#xA0;There were faces that people from the outside didn&apos;t recognize. &#xA0;They didn&apos;t recognize the two Users that occupied the seat of the Aces.</span></p><p><span style="">Of course, Ahn-jaehyun couldn&apos;t remember all the faces he had seen in this world. &#xA0;Moreover, his memory was on the poor side. &#xA0;If he was to spell it out more bluntly, he probably didn&apos;t know the faces of the Rankers more so than knowing them. &#xA0;However, this time not all the faces was unfamiliar to him.</span></p><p><span style="">- V&amp;V guild made an incredibly resolute decision. &#xA0;Still there are a lot of faces I&apos;ve never seen before.</span></p><p><span style="">- I don&apos;t think they were with the guild before. &#xA0;I checked their career data, and it says they worked as normal users.</span></p><p><span style="">Aside from Ahn-jaehyun, many people were interested in V&amp;V Guild&apos;s reorganization. &#xA0;They became suspicious when they saw faces they didn&apos;t recognize.</span></p><p><span style="">- They are normal Users? &#xA0;What are their level? </span></p><p><span style="">- Huhk? &#xA0;Level 200? &#xA0;What the hell? &#xA0;Their levels are &#xA0;on par with the Rankers.</span></p><p><span style="">The bigger problem was that the V&amp;V guild had tried to minimize the backlash for their actions. &#xA0;This was why they posted the Specs of the new faces, and their Specs were much better than an average User. &#xA0;They were all over level 200, and the state of their main Item Setting and the Titles they possessed wasn&apos;t just above average. &#xA0;It was world class.</span></p><p><span style="">The part that bothered Ahn-jaehyun the most was the number of Titles they possessed. &#xA0;It was an incredibly high number.</span></p><p><span style="">The least of them had 150 Titles and the ones with the most had exceeded 200 Titles.</span></p><p><span style="">When leveling up quickly, it was hard to earn the necessary Titles. &#xA0;On the other hand, if one focused only on gaining Titles, the time one needed to invest in leveling up decreased. &#xA0;If one wanted to gain both at the same time, one had to be like Ahn-jaehyun. &#xA0;One had to map out how one will get the Titles, and the most effective Level Up route had to be planned.</span></p><p><span style="">Of course, this was possible for those in the 30 great guilds. &#xA0;They had the intelligence network, and there were those who helped to gather title for guild members.</span></p><p><span style="">If this was the case, the explanation given by the V&amp;V guild clashed with the conventional wisdom. &#xA0;They couldn&apos;t be normal Users.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;They have that many Titles yet they are normal Users? &#xA0;Bullshit.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">There was no way they were just normal Users. &#xA0;The number of Titles they have are impossible to achieve unless they received help from an organization that was on par with the 30 great guilds.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;That bastard showed up last time. &#xA0;It seems these bastards appear every time there is a lull. &#xA0;Are they part of some professional guild that nurtures Users?&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">Anyways, it seemed an unknown organization had appeared, and they were Ahn-jaehyun&apos;s new enemy.</span></p><p><span style="">Ahn-jaehyun&apos;s face hardened.</span></p><p><span style="">Stormhunters, Hydra, Red Bulls and others....</span></p><p><span style="">He never thought any of them were easy enemies. &#xA0;However, they were enemies that he could see.</span></p><p><span style="">However, at that moment, an enemy that he hadn&apos;t seen before had appeared in front of Ahn-jaehyun&apos;s eyes. &#xA0;This enemy wasn&#x2019;t in his memory.</span></p><p><span style="">Of course, he felt anxious.</span></p><p><span style="">The fact that he had accomplished a lot made his anxiety higher. &#xA0;Ahn-jaehyun had too much things to lose now.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;&#x2026;&#x2026;if I become lax, they&apos;ll take it all away from me.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">On the other hand, this anxiety allowed Ahn-jaehyun to come to a decision.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;So my immediate path to a Spec Up.... The Skill Books are the only way.&#x2019;</span></p>
