<p><span style="">Chapter 136 - Immoral Prince (4)</span></p><p>13.</p><p><span style="">Every time a Relic Guardian was killed, the Relic possessed by the Relic Guardian was destroyed. The Immoral Prince lost each of his power as he lost each of his Relics. &#xA0;In the end, the Immoral Prince lost the powerful magic that exceeded the powers of conventional magic. &#xA0;He even lost the use of Red Blood Sword Qi, which had displayed the power to cut anything in this world. &#xA0;In the end, the Darkness that had filled its eyes started to subside too.</span></p><p><span style="">It was the start of the Immoral Prince escaping its own &#xA0;long nightmare. &#xA0;At the same time, it meant the Prince Dean would also have to face off against the nightmare of its own creation.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;We don&apos;t have much time left! &#xA0;Endure!&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Don&apos;t be afraid of a Game Over! &#xA0;Since we are in this, we are seeing this to the end! &#xA0;Don&apos;t be afraid for your life just because you can see the end!&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Of course, the battle was a nightmare from the start to finish for the groups that faced off against the Immoral Prince.</span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan wasn&apos;t watching the battle. &#xA0;He didn&apos;t look at the numerous Users experiencing the nightmare together.</span></p><p><span style="">He was pretty far away from the fight. &#xA0;It was a location where the trees had been cut or broken from the aftermath of the battle. &#xA0;He was sitting on the floor with his head down, and he had his back propped up against one of the intact trees. &#xA0;He had his eyes closed, and one couldn&apos;t even hear his breathing. &#xA0;Hyrkan looked like a corpse.</span></p><p><span style="">Not too far away from Hyrkan, there was someone, who was in the same state as Hyrkan. &#xA0;She was about a dozen feet away from him.</span></p><p><span style="">Even the Storm Queen Shir looked like a corpse.</span></p><p><span style="">Of course, she wasn&apos;t a real corpse. &#xA0;Both of them had reached their limit, and they weren&apos;t able to move. &#xA0;They were in a trance, and they were forcefully hanging on to consciousness through sheer force of will. &#xA0;If they really fell asleep, they&apos;ll be automatically logged out.</span></p><p><span style="">Of course, they had reached their limit, and they had no will to fight any more. &#xA0;Moreover, the two were having a hard time having any new or productive thoughts.</span></p><p><span style="">Still, if they cleared their mind, it would cause them to fall asleep. &#xA0;So the two of them had no choice, but to think about the simplest thoughts that was within reach. &#xA0;They were thinking about something that took the least amount of energy to think about.... They were repeatedly replaying their earlier memories. &#xA0;They were recollecting the events that occurred not too long ago.</span></p><p><span style="">The two of them were battling not to fall asleep. &#xA0;They were thinking about what just happened as a whole. &#xA0;It as something they&apos;ll never be ever to forget.</span></p><p><span style="">Moreover, they weren&apos;t the only ones that were thinking about this ensemble. &#xA0;Two other figures were also thinking about the what had happened.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;These two lasted over 5 minutes against such a monster? &#xA0;They were also able to solo this?&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">After defeating the Relic Guardian, Sohank immediately participated in the battle with the Immoral Prince. &#xA0;When he approached the 3 minute mark of the battle, he thought about the battles conducted by Hyrkan and Shir. It was a superfluous thought that had nothing to do with the current battle. &#xA0;This meant he was having a hard time concentrating, and on top of that, it meant Sohank&apos;s exploit against the Immoral Prince was about to come to an end.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;I have no idea who the monster is now.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">Chev had bought 3 minutes and 44 seconds against the Immoral Prince before he needed a break from the Battle. He thought about the battle conducted by Hyrkan and Shir. He was blown away as he thought about the previous events.</span></p><p><span style="">In the end, these two men were simultaneously feeling the same emotions.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Shit. &#xA0;this is a really fucked up situation.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;I never expected to be in such a miserable state.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">They thought about it. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">They felt regret, then they became depressed.</span></p><p><span style="">They were justified in thinking that they would become heroes in this Raid. &#xA0;They had been so sure about how they&apos;ll perform on this stage, but now they were found lacking. &#xA0;It was a situation where they felt the worst kind of misery that they could have imagined for themselves.</span></p><p><span style="">Moreover, the two men weren&apos;t the ones that brought the end to the Immoral Prince.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Prince Dean!&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Maeung had appeared to put an end to the Immoral Prince&apos;s mutiny.</span></p><p>14.</p><p><span style="">Bulkas Ranger&apos;s Captain, Maeung</span></p><p><span style="">He had formed the Secret Society, and he had fought against Corrupted beings, who misused the power of Corruption. &#xA0;In the end, the naked face of Prince Dean was revealed behind his mask. &#xA0;Maeung, who had worked tirelessly with his life on the line, suddenly appeared in front of Prince Dean. &#xA0;The Users were surprised by Maeung&apos;s appearance, but no one held misgivings about it.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;We&apos;ll just observe the situation.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Just continue the live broadcast. &#xA0;Don&apos;t put in any other audio. &#xA0;Just make it so that their conversation come through. &#xA0;Turn off the commentaries too.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Sohank and Chev also looked on as spectators.</span></p><p><span style="">They had a sour stomach when they realized they couldn&apos;t become the main character of the climax. &#xA0;Still, they couldn&apos;t disrupt the event by speaking unnecessarily. &#xA0;They couldn&#x2019;t bring attention onto themselves during the climax. &#xA0;Several million people were watching this, and if they messed this up, the spectators would react more strongly than being upset in their stomach.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;In the end, you decided to drag me down by the ankles, Maeung.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;There was good cause for me to grab onto your ankles!&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">While being viewed by everyone, Prince Dean and Maeung spoke their true feelings about each other.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;You were like this from beginning. &#xA0;You never trusted any words spoke by me. &#xA0;You always held everything about me in suspicion.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;As I&apos;ve said, I had good reasons to distrust you.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">They were NPCs.</span></p><p><span style="">In the end, the lives they led were mere set-up to the game. &#xA0;Everyone was well aware of this fact.</span></p><p><span style="">Still, all the spectators couldn&apos;t help, but have their emotions shaken by the story behind these two NPCs. &#xA0;Everyone focused their attention on them. &#xA0;In the back of everyone&apos;s head, they knew these two were NPCs, but none of them trivialized the conversation occurring in front of them.</span></p><p><span style="">- Yes. &#xA0;It seems Maeung was suspicious of Prince Dean from an early age.</span></p><p><span style="">- It seems Prince Dean was a useless scum since he was young.</span></p><p><span style="">There were people that even empathized with the situation.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;You even let it slip to my father that I&apos;m not cut out for kingship.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I was sent to live my whole life in the Bulkas mountain range, because of it. &#xA0;That was the cost exacted of me for saying those words. &#xA0;I&apos;ve spent a large portion of my life at the Bulkas mountain range, and I&apos;ve regretted my actions for a long time. &#xA0;However, I don&apos;t regret it anymore. &#xA0;I was right. &#xA0;You aren&apos;t cut out to be the king. &#xA0;You will not succeed the throne of the Havanz kingdom.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Koohng! </span></p><p><span style="">In the midst of the conversation, Prince Dean stomped his foot on the ground. &#xA0;The ground shook. It was as if an enormous golem had stepped forward. &#xA0;The ground let out a brief cry. &#xA0;Everyone, who had been focused on the conversation, became startled.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;The throne does not need a succession! &#xA0;I&apos;ll climb to the top of the throne using my strength!&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Prince Dean yelled out, and the people, who were surprised, felt a chill go up their spine.</span></p><p><span style="">This was how terrifying Prince Dean&apos;s shout was.</span></p><p><span style="">However, Maeung didn&apos;t back down from his voice.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Are you still dreaming, Prince Dean? &#xA0;The only dream you will have from this point on is a nightmare. &#xA0;Wake up. &#xA0;Please wake up from this dream. &#xA0;The Archmage Bokan gave you the name of Dean. &#xA0;I want you to realize the meaning behind your name!&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Dean. </span></p><p><span style="">The name signified a sense of duty on had to perform alongside the martyrs. &#xA0;It was to drive out the nightmares that had visited this world.</span></p><p><span style="">Prince Dean possessed such a name, and Maeung&apos;s word delivered a critical blow to Prince Dean that was more potent than any weapon used against him.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Do not look down upon me!&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Prince Dean&apos;s eyes were burning with flame, and it made one&apos;s blood freeze. &#xA0;As everything drew to a close, Prince Dean&apos;s body started to burn.</span></p><p><span style="">Hwah-roo-roo-roo! </span></p><p><span style="">Prince Dean&apos;s skin started to melt. &#xA0;Then the enormous power that flowed underneath his skin was revealed. &#xA0;It was the power that had made Prince Dean into a transcendent being. &#xA0;This power erupted into flame. His power was on a rampage. &#xA0;Endless black flames exited from between Prince Dean&apos;s armor.</span></p><p><span style="">In the end, his armor started to melt too.</span></p><p><span style="">Finally, the last scene had begun.</span></p><p><span style="">Prince Dean was disintegrating, and now time was his biggest enemy. &#xA0;Even in such a situation, Prince Dean aimed his sword towards Maeung. &#xA0;He planned on using his remaining time to kill Maeung.</span></p><p><span style="">However, Maeung didn&apos;t back down from Prince Dean&apos;s action. &#xA0;Maeung also raised his sword, and he pointed his sword toward Prince Dean. &#xA0;Their stances were like a mirror image of each other.</span></p><p><span style="">They held their swords up, and they eyed each other. Any further words would have no meaning.</span></p><p><span style="">The battle between the two started. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">Kah-ahng, kah-ahng, kahng!</span></p><p><span style="">The battle ended after the sound of steel clashing rang out thrice.</span></p><p><span style="">Ddoohk, ddoohk! </span></p><p><span style="">The arm holding his sword was entirely melted, and Prince Dean&apos;s arm in its entirety fell to the floor. &#xA0;Finally, Prince Dean&apos;s knee melted, and he was on his knees. &#xA0;Black liquid was oozing out from the openings in his armor.</span></p><p><span style="">This was how Prince Dean was vanishing.</span></p><p><span style="">Maeung looked at Prince Dean as he spoke.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;This isn&apos;t why I taught you the way of the sword. &#xA0;How did you get onto the path of Corruption?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I won&apos;t ask for forgiveness from anyone. &#xA0;If you are looking for me to regret my actions, don&apos;t expect it.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">The words were spat out by Prince Dean, but his voice was different now. &#xA0;His voice was diminishing rapidly.</span></p><p><span style="">It seemed Prince Dean would only be able to speak a handful of words. &#xA0;His voice continued to thin out. &#xA0;One wouldn&apos;t have been able to hear his word if one wasn&apos;t nearby and listening really closely.</span></p><p><span style="">Moreover, Maeung also didn&apos;t have much to say to Prince Dean.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;People live behind only their names in death. &#xA0;Dean. &#xA0;Please leave behind something that befits your name.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">However, Prince Dean didn&apos;t give an answer. &#xA0;A feeling of desolation flowed out of him. &#xA0;This feeling lasted for a long time. &#xA0;It lasted for so long that the people started thinking. &#xA0;The Immoral Prince was about to greet death without saying anything. &#xA0;It felt like Prince Dean wasn&apos;t going to say anything.</span></p><p><span style="">With this thought in mind, everyone started to relax when it happened.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Everything started from the Ruined Kingdom. &#xA0;Everything will end there too.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">After leaving behind his last words, Prince Dean caved in on himself.</span></p><p><span style="">[The Immoral Prince has met his death.] </span></p><p><span style="">[The Corrupted Army is no more.] </span></p><p><span style="">Another era had come to an end. &#xA0;However, all the people present were still tense.</span></p><p><span style="">The Immoral Prince was dead. &#xA0;However, the ending to today&apos;s battle hadn&apos;t come to pass yet.</span></p><p><span style="">The one that&apos;ll put the period at the end of this battle wasn&apos;t Maeung. &#xA0;The main characters of Warlord wasn&apos;t the NPCs. &#xA0;It was the Users. &#xA0;Maeung moved across the stage to find the User that&apos;ll bring this battle to a close.</span></p><p><span style="">Maeung headed towards a User that was weakly leaning up against a tree. &#xA0;He stood in front of Hyrkan.</span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan had succeeded.</span></p><p><span style="">He had contributed the most in stopping the Immoral Prince&apos;s Corruption. &#xA0;He deserved the right to bring this era to a close. &#xA0;Everyone in Warlord, and viewers around the world acknowledged this fact.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;You did well. &#xA0;When I saw you for the first time, I thought this task was too much for you. &#xA0;However, in the end, you were able to delay the fall of this world.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">The only thing left was Hyrkan&apos;s answer.</span></p><p><span style="">His answer would be a period at the end of this event. &#xA0;Everyone focused on Hyrkan&apos;s mouth. &#xA0;What would Hyrkan say in such a situation? &#xA0;Would he say lines that would stoke the romanticism of this current situation? &#xA0;Or will he leave behind a long-lasting message? &#xA0;Or maybe he would speak in a playful manner. &#xA0;Maybe his last words will make everyone smile a little bit at the end.</span></p><p><span style="">While everyone was focused on him, Hyrkan opened his mouth.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Huh? &#xA0;It ended? &#xA0;Did we catch them all? &#xA0;Huh? &#xA0;Maeung? &#xA0;What the hell?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">In many ways, his words would remain forever in the history of Warlord. &#xA0;The period was put at the end of this episode.</span></p><p>15.</p><p><span style="">It was a bright office. &#xA0;In most offices, half the lights would be turned off to save cost of electricity. However, this office wasn&apos;t like that at all. &#xA0;It was as if the occupant wanted to use 100% of his lights. &#xA0;The inside of the office was brightly lit.</span></p><p><span style="">The owner of the office was talking busily into the phone.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I asked for a Warlord exclusive V-Gear two weeks ago from the Peach Store. &#xA0;So why haven&apos;t I heard anything even though I contacted them two weeks ago? &#xA0;Report to me the name and position of the man, who turned me down. I&apos;ll negotiate directly with him.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">The owner of the office was young. &#xA0;At the very most, he was in his mid thirties. &#xA0;He was a man with blonde hair, which had been shorn close to his scalp. He looked like a martial artist. The region above his eyes were protruding as if it had been rearranged by fighting over a long period of time. He was a memorable man. &#xA0;If one was being nice then he was memorable. &#xA0;If one was speaking bluntly, he looked menacing.</span></p><p><span style="">This menacing man was named Tobi Gwynn.</span></p><p><span style="">He was Tobo Soft&apos;s founder, and he had made Warlord. &#xA0;With the big success of Warlord, he had experienced a meteoric rise when Tobo Soft set its IPO. &#xA0;His name was now amongst the billionaires of the world.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I&apos;ll say this again. Don&apos;t speak as if you are satisfied. I want you to be on the offensive! &#xA0;I don&apos;t want the other game companies and contents companies to catch their breath! &#xA0;I want you to make it so that anyone, who enjoys Warlord will go to the Peach Store.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tobi Gwynn was nicknamed the Hungry Man. &#xA0;He had a cherished opinion that a man should always be hungry.</span></p><p><span style="">Of course, he was very busy. &#xA0;If he had nothing to do, he made up work to do. &#xA0;That was his personality. &#xA0;This was why all his business was done at the office. &#xA0;He didn&apos;t even want to travel to different locations to meet others. &#xA0;He was very stingy with his time.</span></p><p><span style="">This was why he could do everything he wanted inside his office. If needed, he could use the V-gear to speak to others in the virtual reality. &#xA0;If that was too annoying to do, he could create an augmented reality environment in his office for meetings.</span></p><p><span style="">What was worse was the snacks he had piled up on the corner of his desk. &#xA0;It seemed his meal time was too precious to waste too. &#xA0;If someone who didn&apos;t know him saw his office, one might think this was an office for a snack export business.</span></p><p><span style="">This was why most board members and major shareholders rarely had the opportunity to meet Tobi Gwynn. There was only one person he spoke face to face with on a regular basis.</span></p><p><span style="">Ddok ddok! </span></p><p><span style="">When he heard the knock, Tobi immediately ended the call even though the conversation hadn&apos;t ended.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Enter.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">The door was opened instead of a reply. &#xA0;A very tall, lanky and black-haired Asian man entered.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;The Immoral Prince Raid was completed not too long ago.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Tobo Soft&apos;s Steering Committee Team Leader Chen.</span></p><p><span style="">This man held a post that was quite rare. &#xA0;When most businesses expanded, they kept their planning team, and this team was divided into the strategic planning committee and the management committee. &#xA0;It was very rare for a business to have a steering committee on top of those two. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">This man held a rare position, and he was also the only one that could get a direct audience with Tobi. &#xA0;In many ways, Chen was a unique man.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;How long did it take?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;It took them 49 minutes and 35 seconds.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Amazing. &#xA0;Even in our fastest estimates, the report said it would take at least 70 minutes... &#xA0;Let&apos;s see&#x2026; &#xA0;They finished it 30% faster than expected. &#xA0;Normally, a 30% error or is it a mistake.... No, it can&apos;t be a mistake. &#xA0;Maybe I should call the result to be bullshit. &#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Instead of answering, Chen placed a thick report on Tobi&apos;s desk. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">In this day and age, he was still using paper reports. &#xA0;Tobo Soft was a cutting edge technology company, so it was very hard to come across a report such as this.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I&apos;ve organized the data relating to this Immoral Prince Raid.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Tobi didn&apos;t look at the report.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;We didn&apos;t do our job right. &#xA0;The report probably spells that out, but that is all I need to know. &#xA0;To sum it all up, we were incompetent. &#xA0;Am I right? &#xA0;Do you have a problem with my assessment?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Instead of answering, Chen lightly bowed his head. &#xA0;He was so tall that when he bowed his head, it was more striking. &#xA0;It felt as if his apology was a bit more sincere.</span></p><p><span style="">However, when Chen raised his head again, his face was unapologetic. &#xA0;There was no indication that Chen was troubled by anything that had happened.</span></p><p><span style="">Instead, he immediately placed a new report on Tobi&apos;s desk. &#xA0;Tobi eyed the new report. &#xA0;The report was much thinner than the one before. &#xA0;If one counted it, it was only 15 pages. &#xA0;Tobi turned his eyes towards Chen.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;This is a proposal for a new project.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;A new project?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes. The methods we have been using up until now isn&apos;t working. &#xA0;Our existing strategies will be discarded, and I believe we have to come up with new methods.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Tobi nodded his head lightly.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;A new project. &#xA0;I like that word. &#xA0;Isn&apos;t that a word used by motivated people? &#xA0;Isn&apos;t that right?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Tobi immediately read the content of the report. &#xA0;No, Tobi didn&apos;t read the report. &#xA0;He just looked over it, and in a flash, it was stored inside his head. &#xA0;After saving the 15 pages inside his head, he closed his eyes. &#xA0;He was now earnestly reading the content of the report.</span></p><p><span style="">Tobi opened his mouth when he read the content of the report.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;We will lose 2 more months from our estimated time period.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;To be precise, it&apos;ll be 61 days. &#xA0;I am aware of it.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Do it.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">When the answer was given, Chen immediately took the reports handed to him by Tobi, and he left the office.</span></p><p><span style="">When Chen disappeared, Tobi started tapping his forehead with his hand. &#xA0;The expression he had on his face as he tapped his forehead was ill-matched with the bright atmosphere of his office.</span></p>
