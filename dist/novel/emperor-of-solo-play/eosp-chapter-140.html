<p><span style="">Chapter 140 - Across the Terube Castle Wall (1)</span></p><p>1.</p><p><span style="">The NPC hadn&#x2019;t reach the status of being a young man. &#xA0;Its youthful appearance was stuck between that of a boy and a young man.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Are you serious?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">It spoke in a grave manner, which clashed with the delicate voice it possessed.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Will you really do as you say?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Even the deep wrinkles that was forming at the top of its face gave off a child-like impression. &#xA0;It diluted the message it was giving.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Are you really planning on traveling beyond the Terube castle wall?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">It was the captain in charge of the Terube castle wall. &#xA0;It had been loyal subject to Prince Dean. &#xA0;However, it was also a hidden hero of this world, who had fought against the Corrupted monsters. &#xA0;Bagel rejoiced at the offer given by the man in front of it. &#xA0;It was beyond rejoicing. &#xA0;There seemed to be a different reason aside from happiness that made Bagel suddenly stand up from its seat.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ooh-oohk!&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">When it stood up, a moan immediately escaped Bagel&apos;s mouth. It was always prepared for battle. &#xA0;Bagel was in its office, yet it was in its armor. &#xA0;This was why one couldn&apos;t see the wound beneath the armor. &#xA0;It still possessed the evidence of betrayal perpetrated by Prince Dean and the White-eyed swordsman Argardo. &#xA0;It still had the sword wound.</span></p><p><span style="">Bagel was lucky to be alive. &#xA0;The wound was so severe that it was shocking that Bagel was still carrying out his duties, while equipped in its armor. &#xA0;This was why Bagel didn&apos;t complain about its slow recovery.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I&apos;m fine. &#xA0;I&apos;m all right.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">When he heard the moan, the guest got up from his seat to approach Bagel. &#xA0;Bagel waved him away.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I&apos;m just thankful that I am alive. &#xA0;I don&apos;t want to burden a hero like you, because of this.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">The guest put on an awkward smile, and he sat back down. Bagel moved to the corner of its office where its books were organized. &#xA0;It immediately pulled out a book.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;This is something I acquired a long time ago.&quot; &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">From its outward appearance, the book was thick. &#xA0;However, the book wasn&apos;t filled with many pages. &#xA0;The reason being the thickness of each page. &#xA0;The book was filled with woodblocks. &#xA0;Bagel took out the book, and it carefully looked over the engravings on the pages. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;This was before I became the captain in charge of the Terube wall. &#xA0;This was even before I followed him when he became the Guardian of the Northern lands.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">The woodblocks were filled with engravings of a map. &#xA0;Bagel took the book, and he sat atop of his desk. In the process, his heavy armor moved, and it seemed the wound had been disturbed again. &#xA0;Bagel&apos;s expression crumpled, but it didn&apos;t moan this time.</span></p><p><span style="">When Bagel&apos;s pained face resolved itself, it took out the woodblocks contained in the book. &#xA0;It started piecing them together as if they were pieces of a puzzle. </span></p><p><span style="">As Hyrkan had surmised, the woodblocks were a map.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;This is the map of the Northern land. &#xA0;This was before this era where the endless battle hadn&apos;t started yet.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">His explanation was grandiose, but the content of the map was quite poor. &#xA0;Most of the map was drawn in an abstract manner. &#xA0;There was a long road, and there were monsters that were letting out flame next to the road. &#xA0;The mountain was drawn like a big lump of cotton. The trees inside the forest was drawn like doodles, and there were no markers naming everything. &#xA0;Moreover, the map was incomplete. &#xA0;The top part of the map was missing. &#xA0;It was as if the map&apos;s head had been cut away.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;It is a relic from a long time ago, so it isn&apos;t perfect.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Bagel tapped on top of of the table as he tapped at the empty portion of the map.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;In the end, I never found out what is here. &#xA0;Moreover, there is no one alive that knows this information either.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The guest, who had listened to it in silence, finally asked some questions.</span></p><p><span style="">What do you think is over there? &#xA0;Do you perhaps know any other information regarding the place?</span></p><p><span style="">However, Bagel had heard all the information available, so it let out a long sigh.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I have my hand full from defending the Terube castle wall. &#xA0;At times, I tasked a subordinate to investigate what was on the other side of the castle wall. &#xA0;However, they just came back with warnings of overwhelming number of monsters, or they went missing. &#xA0;If I wanted a thorough investigation, I would have to lead forth a large army. &#xA0;I couldn&apos;t send a large army across the thick castle wall, and through the mysterious barrier to explore the Northern land. This is especially true, since I&apos;ll be doing it just to satisfy my curiosity.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">The guest said couple more words to Bagel. &#xA0;Bagel gathered boths its hand, so it could prop its chin on top. &#xA0;It spoke in that position.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes. It is as you said. &#xA0;The power of Corruption may be... &#xA0;That upright person might have a clue about the power of Corruption. &#xA0;This is why I was curious about what was there in the past. &#xA0;However, I felt I had a duty to find out what was there. &#xA0;However!&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">However....</span></p><p><span style="">That word was filled with heavy implication. &#xA0;The guest was about to ask a question, but he swallowed the question.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;No one was allowed to explore this place.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Bagel immediately put on a big frown. &#xA0;It wasn&apos;t caused by his wound.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;There are already movements set in motion. &#xA0;A large-scale change is coming. &#xA0;For now, no one will be able to assume the power of the Northern land. &#xA0;In such a situation, no rewards will be given. &#xA0;There will be a ban placed on the Northern land. &#xA0;The Hiban kingdom, and even the Subjugation Association won&apos;t lend a hand. &#xA0;This is a search conducted to find the unknown, and there will be no prize awarded. &#xA0;The only way you will be able to receive a reward is to bring back &#xA0;result.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Bagel maintained its expression, and it immediately asked him a question.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Do you still want to go to the other side of the castle wall?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Instead of answering, the guest nodded his head. &#xA0;Bagel immediately got up from its seat.</span></p><p><span style="">Afterwards, Bagel worked with practiced ease. &#xA0;It painted ink over the woodblocks, and Bagel placed a white parchment over it. &#xA0;The very rough map was handed over to the guest. </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Be safe.&#x201D; &#xA0;</span></p><p>2.</p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Be safe.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">[Quest &apos;Across the Terube Castle Wall&apos; has started.] </span></p><p><span style="">When Bagel said those words, Hrykan heard the Quest Announcement. &#xA0;Hyrkan&apos;s expression was twitching right now.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Shit.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">He was forcefully trying to hide his expression. &#xA0;It seemed he wasn&apos;t trying to hide a favorable expression. &#xA0;It was quite evident that he was trying to hide a negative emotion.</span></p><p><span style="">He had a reason for it.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;This is the word I told those before you, who are willingly throw one&#x2019;s body forward into danger for the peace of the world. &#xA0;I will also say those same words to you. &#xA0;Be safe, and I hope you bring hope like before.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Someone had arrived before him.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Some bastard came here before me?&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">If one wanted to go to the Frozen Kingdom, this place was the door everyone had to pass through. &#xA0;When Hyrkan arrived at the Terube castle, he was greeted fondly by Bagel. &#xA0;Hyrkan was the Hiban kingdom&apos;s hero, and he was the Arbiter of Corruption. &#xA0;Moreover, Hyrkan had defeated Argardo, who scored a deep wound on Bagel. &#xA0;Hyrkan was Bagel&apos;s savior and hero.</span></p><p><span style="">It was to be expected. &#xA0;Bagel had been a bit prickly in the past, but it wasn&apos;t like that at all.</span></p><p><span style="">On top of it all, Hyrkan felt uncomfortable when he saw what kind of expression Bagel had on when it looked at Hyrkan. &#xA0;It was as if a young junior was looking at a cool senior with longing and expectation mixed within its gaze. &#xA0;Moreover, the gaze was coming from a pretty boy, and Hyrkan had never received such a gaze from anyone before. &#xA0;From Hyrkan&apos;s perspective, it was beyond uncomfortable. &#xA0;It was close to unsettling.</span></p><p><span style="">This was how the conversation had started, and Hyrkan&apos;s inside started to feel a wrenching sensation as the conversation continued along.</span></p><p><span style="">When the conversation came to an end, Hyrkan&apos;s inside had moved on from feeling a wrenching feeling. &#xA0;His inside were in a knot.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;I don&apos;t know who, but that bastard cost me one Title.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">Someone had already met Bagel, and this someone was already headed towards the Frozen Kingdom.</span></p><p><span style="">This fact in itself didn&apos;t put him in a good mood. &#xA0;No one would welcome the appearance of a competitor.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;The Noble Walk Title.... &#xA0;It increases one&apos;s Stamina by 50 points, yet I lost it to someone else. &#xA0;Before I did my other tasks, I should have come here to get the Quest and Title beforehand. &#xA0;Shit!&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">From Hyrkan&apos;s perspective, the preceding visitor had stolen a Title that was rightfully his.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;In the end, I was only able to earn the Noble Explorer.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">The Title &#x2018;Noble Explorer&#x2019; was something one earned when one gained the incredibly important Exploration Quest. &#xA0;It increased one&apos;s Intelligence by 25 points.</span></p><p><span style="">However, Hyrkan felt wistful at losing the Title &apos;Noble Steps.&apos; </span></p><p><span style="">It was a Title given to the first one to receive the Quest and the Noble Explorer Title. &#xA0;It increased one&apos;s Stamina by 50 Points. </span></p><p><span style="">He had lost a Title that would have raised his Stamina by 50 Points. This wasn&apos;t something he could simply get over by feeling sorry for himself.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Which organization was it?&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">His insides were hurting so much that it felt as if his insides were rotting.</span></p><p><span style="">However, his pain shrivelled away when a thought that made a chill run up his spine popped up inside his head.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Was it perhaps the Stormhunters?&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">One couldn&apos;t go across the Terube Castle just because one wanted to.</span></p><p><span style="">First, one needed a prior relationship with Bagel. &#xA0;At the same time, one needed to have done a lot of jobs related to the Subjugation Association. &#xA0;If one did a lot of work related to the Subjugation Association, it meant one probably had to catch a hideous amount of monsters.</span></p><p><span style="">At this point in the game, the only ones that had the qualifications to start the Frozen Kingdom Quest was the highest Ranked Users.</span></p><p><span style="">Moreover, the Stormhunters sufficiently met this criteria. &#xA0;Before he returned to the past, the Frozen Kingdom had been monopolized by the Storm Hunters. &#xA0;This was why Hyrkan was well informed about the Titles. &#xA0;The Stormhunters monopolized the Frozen Kingdom, and they revealed the Titles, Skill Books and Items that were obtained there.</span></p><p><span style="">Basically, he didn&apos;t discount the idea that maybe some Items were fated to be in the hands of certain individual. &#xA0;He couldn&apos;t discount the fact that this was meant to be. &#xA0;At this point in the game, it was quite possible that the Stormhunters were progressing in the Frozen Kingdom Quest.</span></p><p><span style="">Moreover, this version of the Stormhunters guild was much stronger than the one that had attempted the Frozen Kingdom.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;This is driving me nuts.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Understood.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">While he was deep within thoughts, Hyrkan was trying to wrap up the conversation, so he spoke the words that would basically put an end to their exchange.</span></p><p><span style="">Since he put an end to the conversation, he was about to get up.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Are you planning on heading there immediately?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Bagel suddenly grabbed Hyrkan. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;It will be a dangerous road. &#xA0;I was thinking maybe you should make a little bit more preparation.... &#xA0;I readied something that&apos;ll help you in your exploration.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan put on an awkward smile.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Bagel hadn&apos;t been such a character before... &#xA0;Things are turning a bit weird now that our Affinity is high.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">At that moment, Hyrkan had no choice, but to sit back down.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Well, I did kill someone, who had tried to kill him. He wouldn&apos;t send me into a deadly situation without giving me anything. &#xA0;Absolutely.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">Since it said it will give him something, he wasn&apos;t going to turn it down. &#xA0;Moreover, Hyrkan had spent much more than he had planned on his recent purchases.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Give me a Skill Book. &#xA0;Please.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">After he gained the [Chivalry] skill, he once again purchased No Name Skill Books to gain the [Leader] Skill.</span></p><p><span style="">However, the result was a complete loss.</span></p><p><span style="">When he thought about that, Hyrkan eventually frowned. &#xA0;He had tossed money into the air. &#xA0;Of course, he wouldn&apos;t feel good about it.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Wait a moment.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Of course, Bagel didn&apos;t know Hyrkan&apos;s true feelings. &#xA0;It vacated its seat to get the present for Hyrkan.</span></p><p><span style="">When he was alone, Hyrkan once again agonized over his thoughts.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;For reals. &#xA0;Who was it?&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">He kept worrying over it... &#xA0;He was worried he had missed something important.</span></p><p>3.</p><p><span style="">Natal had his Hologram Window in front of him, and he was looking at something. &#xA0;He was looking at portraits.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What are you looking at?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Sohank discreetly appeared behind him. &#xA0;He had shown enough of a presence as he approached Natal. &#xA0;He didn&apos;t want to surprise Natal. This was also why Natal was able to answer in a calm manner.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;This is the portraits of the Users that gained the Quest from Bagel after us.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Portrait. </span></p><p><span style="">In Warlord, one could film from all kinds of angle unlike in reality. &#xA0;However, if the Users being filmed had turned off the facial recognition setting, there was no way one could film their faces. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">This was why this method was developed. &#xA0;A User that was adept at drawing would draw a portrait after seeing the target with his own eyes.</span></p><p><span style="">In Warlord and any other virtual reality games, everything was made possible through cutting edge technology. &#xA0;In such a world, the people who were good with their hands were more valuable. &#xA0;It was ironic that they were more valuable in a virtual world.</span></p><p><span style="">Of course, Sohank and Natal didn&apos;t care if it was ironic or not.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;So basically the one we are chasing may be in one of these portraits.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">The appearance of the Users that had a face to face meeting with Bagel was saved. &#xA0;This was to gather information on their competitors beforehand.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Fortunately, there aren&apos;t anyone famous here.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;If you say we are fortunate, we are fortunate.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">If there had been a famous face amongst them,there was no downside in being vigilant against the famous User. &#xA0;Still, even if they were unknown Users, there was a chance they might become a big competitor. &#xA0;There was no reason why they shouldn&apos;t gather information on everyone like this. &#xA0;It might not matter to any other guild, but it was very important to the Hydra guild. </span></p><p><span style="">They knew the importance of data and information. &#xA0;Their guild used both as weapons.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;This one looks pretty hopeless.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Of course, not everyone was determined to be a competitor. &#xA0;Sometimes, one could discount a person just by looking at his face. &#xA0;One shouldn&apos;t be prejudiced when making a judgement in a game. &#xA0;On the other hand, these habits were hard to break.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ah. &#xA0;Doesn&apos;t this guy look like a real pushover?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">However, Natal wasn&apos;t also free from judging a book by its cover. </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I am hesitant to make judgements based on a person&apos;s look, but even I think this guy isn&apos;t one of our competitors.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I feel the same way. Still, it could be possible, right?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;That is what people who purchase lottery tickets think before they purchase it.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Natal smirked at Sohank&apos;s words.</span></p><p><span style="">When he heard Natal&apos;s laughter, Sohank discreetly changed his expression. &#xA0;He spoke in a slightly calmer voice.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;This is going to be quite an annoying mission. &#xA0;&#xA0;I&#x2019;m just here as the muscle, but the rest of eight heads &#xA0;have to assess all possibilities.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Isn&#x2019;t that our role?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Sometime I wonder if I cause harm to our guild.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">After he spoke those words, a bitter smile appeared on his lips. &#xA0;&#xA0;He was on break, but it seemed Sohand was unable to take a break. &#xA0;It seemed he felt apologetic towards his comrades, who had to constantly use their intellect.</span></p><p><span style="">Natal immediately shot down that idea.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;That is the case at all. &#xA0;We can&apos;t do this through our heads only. &#xA0;We were able to get to this point thanks to Sohank-nim.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;No. We are lacking with just me. &#xA0;In truth, I already know how I measure up to others. If our Stats are the same, I might be able to go up against the Matador, but I know I will lose to the Storm Queen. &#xA0;Then there is the Hahoe...&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">The two of them were about to have a more frank discussion, but....</span></p><p><span style="">- The monsters have appeared! &#xA0;There are nine of them. &#xA0;I don&apos;t think it&apos;ll be easy.</span></p><p><span style="">An urgent voice was heard through the voice talk.</span></p><p><span style="">Sohank didn&apos;t finish his words before he started speaking out new directions.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I&apos;ll be there. &#xA0;Before I get there, put the Tankers at the center, and defend! &#xA0;Don&apos;t attempt any rash attacks until I get there!&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">- Yes! </span></p><p><span style="">Kwah-ahng! </span></p><p><span style="">Before the conversation could end, a terrifying roar rang out. &#xA0;Sohank and Natal moved together. &#xA0;They didn&apos;t have to speak to coordinate with each other. &#xA0;There was no carelessness or leisure in their movements.</span></p><p><span style="">This place was a location beyond the Terube castle walls. &#xA0;Even the Hydra guild&apos;s best troops couldn&apos;t be careless. &#xA0;This place was filled with level 200 monsters, and they were of a different quality from all the monsters they had faced before.</span></p>
