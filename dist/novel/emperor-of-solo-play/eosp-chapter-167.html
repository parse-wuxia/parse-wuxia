<p>Chapter 167 &#x2013; Trace of Bokan (3)</p><p>8.</p><p><span style="">The Heard Fortress Ruin town grew by the day. &#xA0;A castle wall grew taller each day as if it was a bamboo tree in growth. &#xA0;Of course, houses made out of logs and brick were erected beyond the castle walls.</span></p><p><span style="">They sprung up everywhere.</span></p><p><span style="">Amongst all of them, the most eye-catching building was the one built out of bricks. &#xA0;The construction of the building was almost completed. &#xA0;It was the Heard Fortress Ruin branch of the Subjugation Association. &#xA0;It was 5 stories high, and &#xA0;it was also the largest building in terms of width.</span></p><p><span style="">Moreover, it had the most Users within the building.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Move it! &#xA0;Let me get some Quests!&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Is there anyone willing to hunt with me? &#xA0;I&apos;m looking for a Striker!&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hey! &#xA0;Over here! &#xA0;Look here! &#xA0;Over here!&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">This was the only way station in the Black Continent, so of course, it had a lot of people. &#xA0;Moreover, when people gathered, a marketplace always popped up. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">The Users here had all gone through their 2nd Advancement. &#xA0;Their Levels and Items would have brought admiring gazes to themselves if it was anywhere else, but here. &#xA0;It didn&apos;t work like that over here. &#xA0;There were too many monsters here with high levels and great items to be boastful.</span></p><p><span style="">Moreover, a real monster had appeared inside the town.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;It&apos;s the Hahoe Mask.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;The Hahoe Mask really came.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Since he came here, I&apos;m guessing he is here for a Quest. &#xA0;I heard he crossed the Urugal mountain range again.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;If he suffered a Game Over, he would have been summoned here. &#xA0;There&apos;s no other reason why he would have crossed the Urugal mountain range.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;It was the same with the Immoral Prince episode, and the the Frozen Kingdom episode. &#xA0;We have to follow after the Hahoe Mask.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">Hahoe Mask.</span></p><p><span style="">The fact that he had arrived at the Heard Fortress Ruin town wasn&apos;t just spread to the Users. &#xA0;It was spread so far that people, who didn&apos;t play Warlord, was aware of this fact.</span></p><p><span style="">Moreover, the fact that the Hahoe Mask sought out the branch of the Subjugation Association meant that the he had business here. </span></p><p><span style="">The Hahoe Mask wasn&apos;t just a skilled User. &#xA0;He was like a magnet that pulled along the flow of Warlord.</span></p><p><span style="">The Subjugation Association was where one could receive a Quest. &#xA0;His appearance at this location meant that the Hahoe Mask was on a Quest. &#xA0;Of course, there was no way it was a normal Quest. &#xA0;When the Hahoe Mask entered the branch office of the Subjugation Association, he didn&apos;t stay on the first floor where the normal Quests were processed. &#xA0;A guard guided the Hahoe Mask upstairs, and the rumor of this incident started to spread. &#xA0;The expressions on the Users near the Subjugation Association changed.</span></p><p>9.</p><p><span style="">NPC Diung was a young man with a face full of scars. &#xA0;The NPC was young yet he had scars. &#xA0;These two elements usually didn&apos;t go hand in hand with each other. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">The NPC took out a pouch made out of rags. </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;This is the Item I found recently.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">NPC Diung handed over the pouch to the User wearing the Hahoe Mask.</span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan immediately opened the pouch, and he took out the item.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;As expected, it is a Conch.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">The pouch held a Conch, which gave off a yellow gleam. &#xA0;It was metallic, and it was similar in size to the Wooden Conch he had found in the Ruins. &#xA0;Its shape was also similar. &#xA0;Therefore, it was easy to figure out how to operate the Golden Conch.</span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan immediately pressed the Golden Conch to his ears.</span></p><p><span style="">Instead of the relaxing sounds of waves, a voice could be heard.</span></p><p><span style="">- My name is Bokan. &#xA0;I&apos;m at a tomb. &#xA0;It is the grave of some unknown person, and I was able to witness the Power of Corruption here. &#xA0;This is why I&apos;m leaving behind a record.</span></p><p><span style="">The voice sounded dry. &#xA0;It was hard to determine the age of the speaker by listening to its voice, and there were static included with the message. &#xA0;If he didn&apos;t concentrate, he wouldn&apos;t be able to differentiate between the voice and the background static.</span></p><p><span style="">At the same time, the message was short.</span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan waited to hear more of story, but there was no followup message.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;This game is really too much.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">Basically, that was all the information he would get.</span></p><p><span style="">It had introduced itself as Bokan. &#xA0;It had revealed where it was at by saying it was at a grave. &#xA0;Then it spoke about the result of its action by mentioning its sighting of the Power of Corruption.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;I have to find the location using just this information?&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan would have to find the trace of Bokan using this clue. &#xA0;When he arrived at a predetermined destination, the Golden Conch would give him a new clue. &#xA0;This was the most common way the Users progressed in a Quest within the Ruined Kingdom Episode.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;So stingy. &#xA0;Couldn&apos;t they have been a little bit more free in giving out information?&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan harbored a brief feeling of discontent, but he didn&apos;t let it progress any further. &#xA0;Nothing would change if he dwelled on his frustration. &#xA0;Hyrkan was well aware of this fact.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;So where did you find it?&quot; </span></p><p><span style="">Anyways, the starting point would always be where the Item was found. &#xA0;He just had to find the next path from there.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I found it at the Balos ruins.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Balos ruins was the location discovered by the Stormhunters guild.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;In the end, I have to head east?&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">It seemed Hyrkan&apos;s fate was closely intertwined with the Stormhunters guild.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;A tomb.....&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan knew that the word, &apos;tomb&apos;, appeared a lot in the Ruined Kingdom. &#xA0;There were a lot of locations that started or ended with tomb. &#xA0;As the word indicated, the Ruined Kingdom had been a nation. &#xA0;During the kingdom&apos;s era of prosperity, kings and other important figures were buried in tombs, and these tombs were usually filled with Items.</span></p><p><span style="">Wouldn&#x2019;t a tomb be called a ruin if it was big enough?</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;East.... &#xA0;It would be a jackpot if I find the King&apos;s Tomb.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">Of course, if the King&apos;s Tomb was found, it would be a jackpot for him. &#xA0;At the very least, he would be able to gain two scrolls of Legendary Rank Ancient Power. &#xA0;If he was lucky, he would be able obtain an amazing Item. &#xA0;Even if it was a lesser tomb, there should be multiple Items within it.</span></p><p><span style="">Of course, these tombs were difficult. &#xA0;If one found the tomb of a famous king, one would have to fight a monster that was as strong as the Boss Monster guarding the peak of the Urugal mountain range. &#xA0;An exciting clash against the guardians of the tombs would be waiting for the Users.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Let&apos;s look at this in a positive light.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan systematically listed the important facts. &#xA0;East would be preferable than going to the north or the south. &#xA0;Hyrkan and the Stormhunters guild could fight until their faces were red if they wanted to, but an excuse would be needed to start the feud. &#xA0;However, the Five Stars guild didn&apos;t need any pretext. &#xA0;They would try to kill Hyrkan on sight.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Was there any other clues left behind.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;None. This item was by itself in the middle of a room.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;All right. &#xA0;Good job.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan was about to leave. &#xA0;Since he had nothing to gain here, why should he stay any longer?</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ah. &#xA0;Also...&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan was about to walk away when NPC Diung stopped him. </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;In the near future, the Hiban kingdom will dispatch an order of knights here. I believe you deserve to know this, Hyrkan-nim. &#xA0;It&apos;ll happen in secret, so please don&apos;t tell anyone else about this.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Really?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan tilted his head.</span></p><p><span style="">The word, &apos;order of knights&apos;, wasn&apos;t a bad thing in itself.</span></p><p><span style="">The problem arose in Hyrkan&apos;s memories regarding the order of knights and the Ruined Kingdom. &#xA0;He knew what came out when these two elements were mixed.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Which order of knights....&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I cannot tell you any more than that. &#xA0;However, the Hiban kingdom decided this fallen kingdom needed a closer examination. &#xA0;They will be here on orders.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Thank you for informing me.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Then I&apos;ll pray for your success. &#xA0;Please find the whereabouts of our Archmage.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">After nodding his head, Hyrkan exited the room. &#xA0;However, Hyrkan&apos;s thoughts weren&apos;t filled with information regarding the Archmage Bokan.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Are the Steel Lion Knights heading this way? &#xA0;Was the Barbarian King event already triggered?&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">Black Continent.... &#xA0;Before Hyrkan returned to the past, the Ruined Kingdom was called the Lost World, and several troops of knights had appeared there. &#xA0;Of course, they appeared for Quests and events. &#xA0;They would never appear randomly to take down a monster.</span></p><p><span style="">Moreover, the appearance of the Steel Lion Knights and the Barbarian King event was an integral part of the Ruined Kingdom episode.</span></p><p><span style="">It was akin to the great battle. The Steel Lion Knights would start to operate within the Black Continent with great success, and they would eventually awaken the Barbarian King. &#xA0;From that point on, the Users would have to fight against the Barbarian King. &#xA0;The Barbarian King had a special characteristic of being able use all monsters as vassals. &#xA0;Its power was selected to be akin to the Power of Corruption.</span></p><p><span style="">If things ended there, it wouldn&apos;t be a problem. &#xA0;The problem was the regions surrounding the Barbarian King. &#xA0;In the regions near the Boss monster, the Regeneration time and number changed.</span></p><p><span style="">Basically, the Barbarian King made all monsters its subordinates. &#xA0;To satisfy this setting, the nearby hunting grounds became empty as they gathered beneath the Barbarian King.</span></p><p><span style="">Basically, the Users, who frequently hunted in the Black Continent, would be forced to take down the Barbarian King.</span></p><p><span style="">At the time, Tobot Soft took a lot of heat as swear words automatically came out of the Users. However, the developers hid behind the excuse that they didn&apos;t have the ability to arbitrarily change the game. &#xA0;The AI made the decision on how the events developed in Warlord, and they no longer interfered with the system on the development side.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;No way. &#xA0;The Barbarian King is suppose to come out at the latter stages of the Ruined Kingdom episode.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">When the Barbarian King was taken down, the Users find out why the Ruined Kingdom collapsed. &#xA0;Then there was the power left behind by the Ruined Kingdom. &#xA0;It was made, so the Users could avenge the Ruined Kingdom by fighting the beings that caused their collapse. &#xA0;This was when the beings that drove the Kingdom to ruins was revealed.</span></p><p><span style="">This was the starting point of the Dragon&apos;s Army episode.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;There is no way that&#x2019;ll occur.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">The Ruined Kingdom episode had just started, so there was no way the signs regarding the Dragon&apos;s Army would show up.</span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan let out a bitter laugh as he lightly shook his head from side to side.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;There is no way the high and mighty AI could made such a mistake.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">After descending the stairway, Hyrkan left the Subjugation Association.</span></p><p>10.</p><p><span style="">A person didn&apos;t change. &#xA0;It didn&apos;t matter if a User was level 1, level 100 or level 200. &#xA0;In the end, Users were humans. &#xA0;In the end, the bad apple will continue to be a bad apple, and the cheaters will always cheat.</span></p><p><span style="">Of course, the schemers will continue to scheme.</span></p><p><span style="">When one continue to scheme, there would always be a day of reckoning.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Let&apos;s do this!&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Five Users were about to pay the price for playing games.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I purposefully moved in a circuitous route, and I passed by this location not too long ago. &#xA0;Look here. &#xA0;I clearly left behind this scratch when I walked past this tree.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">He looked at the Users, who would be forced to pay a price.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;We....&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;So you are trying to say you guys were coincidentally taking the same route as me. &#xA0;Stop lying.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">The User&apos;s name was Hyrkan, and his nickname was the Hahoe Mask.</span></p><p><span style="">We was the most famous User in Warlord, and one must never make an enemy out of him.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What is your affiliation? &#xA0;V&amp;V? &#xA0;Big Smiles?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">These five Users had been tailing after the Hahoe Mask.</span></p><p><span style="">It happened quite often. &#xA0;When a User received an important Quest from the Subjugation Association, one basically had the spoon half way up to one&apos;s mouth. &#xA0;The one raising the spoon was the target, and if the owner of the Quest could be eliminated, the Quest Reward could be taken by someone else.</span></p><p><span style="">Then there were the Users, who interfered with the progress of an opponent&apos;s Quest.</span></p><p><span style="">Of course, the User suffering these kinds of schemes had the right to lash out.</span></p><p><span style="">The Hahoe Mask would be in the right even if he killed the five Users tailing him.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Run!&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">The five Users made the wise choice. &#xA0;If their opponent wasn&apos;t Hyrkan, this plan would have worked.</span></p><p><span style="">Chul-kuhk, chul-kuhk! </span></p><p><span style="">However, this was the Hahoe Mask. &#xA0;He controlled over 60 Skeletons, and a loose retreat wasn&apos;t a wise choice.</span></p><p><span style="">Before the five Users had been aware of it, the Skeleton Warriors had already created a perimeter around them. &#xA0;They blocked the Users from escaping.</span></p><p><span style="">The five Users had planned on simultaneously running in different directions. &#xA0;The five Users once again looked at Hyrkan.</span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan met their gazes as he spoke.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;The five of you can fight against each other, and I&apos;ll let the last surviving User live.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">At his words, two of the five Users sneered at him. &#xA0;The other three members flipped their middle fingers towards Hyrkan.</span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan smiled as he flicked his finger.</span></p><p>11.</p><p><span style="">[The Hydra guild merged with the Fighters guild!] </span></p><p><span style="">[Hydra guild: &#xA0;&quot;The Fighters guild is the strongest in terms of battle capability amongst the Underfoot guilds. &#xA0;We need them. &#xA0;They will supplement the part where the Hydra guild is weakest.&#x201D;] </span></p><p><span style="">[Fighters guild: &#xA0;&#x201C;We agreed to it the moment we received an offer from the Hyrdra guild. &#xA0;Our merge will create the best synergistic effect.&#x201D;] </span></p><p><span style="">[This is the first instance where an Underfoot guild merged with one of the 30 great guilds. &#xA0;Is this the start of a new reorganization of the power structure?] </span></p><p><span style="">Many articles were being written with titles saying the Hydra guild had merged with the Fighters guild. &#xA0;The news was being spread fast.</span></p><p><span style="">While the news was spreading, Eric Gomes had turned off his smartphone and every other forms of communication he possessed. &#xA0;He was listening to music.</span></p><p><span style="">It was a habit he developed long ago when he worked on Wall Street. &#xA0;If he succeeded, he would hit the jackpot. &#xA0;If he failed, he would go bankrupt. &#xA0;</span><span style="">He had made irrevocable decisions that could have led to either outcome, and when he made the decision, Eric Gomes cut himself off from the outside world. &#xA0;He realized that he could do nothing once he had the irrevocable decision.</span></p><p><span style="">It meant that the decision he had made recently was a decision in the same vein.</span></p><p><span style="">He always had thought about acquiring the Fighters guild. &#xA0;In truth, there wasn&apos;t much downside to the merge. &#xA0;The Fighters guild possessed Users with high combat ability. &#xA0;They would be able to fill Hyrdra&apos;s biggest need in one fell swoop.</span></p><p><span style="">Of course, the problem always came down to money. &#xA0;The Hyrdra guild wasn&apos;t the only ones, who had coveted the Fighters guild. &#xA0;In such a situation, there was no reason why the Fighters guild would lower their market value.</span></p><p><span style="">Basically, the acquisition had been an unreasonable bet. &#xA0;The Hydra guild had paid a heavy price.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Life is a funny thing. &#xA0;I can&apos;t believe I made a decision like this, because of the Hungry man.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">The impetus behind such a bold bet was the Hungry man, Toby Gwynn.</span></p><p><span style="">He had suddenly contacted Eric Gomes, and he divulged information that hadn&apos;t been released to the public.</span></p><p><span style="">When he heard the information, Eric Gomes understood the reasoning behind the actions taken by the Tobot Soft.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;As always, success comes to those, who are prepared. &#xA0;The great success is reaped by those that are lucky.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">At the same time, Eric Gomes realized that he had no choice, but to stand with Toby Gwynn. &#xA0;The gains wanted by Toby Gwynn was in a similar direction to the gains wanted by Eric Gomes. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">When he heard Toby Gwynn&apos;s story, he immediately purchased the Fighters guild. &#xA0;He needed to take the initiative.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;I have to see the big picture especially in times like this.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">This was a lesson he had learned while working at Wall Street for 10 years. &#xA0;The further you were away from where money was being traded, the opportunity to make money also disappeared. &#xA0;The funny part was the fact even if one distanced oneself from the market where money flowed back and forth, this didn&apos;t mean the opportunity to lose money went away too.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;So the problem becomes the Hahoe Mask again?&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">According to the information given to him by Toby Gwynn, the biggest problem right now was the Hahoe Mask.</span></p><p><span style="">A person working outside the standard structure would eventually wreck the structure.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;He told me such precious information, because he expects me to block people like the Hahoe Mask and the Stormhunters guild from rocking the boat too much.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">Toby Gwynn had given the Hyrdra guild information, because it would be profitable for the Hydra guild to keep the Hahoe Mask in check.</span></p><p><span style="">It was a really hard task.</span></p><p><span style="">However, Eric Gomes thought of it in simple terms.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;If I look at the most recent events... &#xA0;There is a good possibility that the Hahoe Mask doesn&apos;t have a backer. &#xA0;Even if he had one, it isn&apos;t a big organization.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">In the past, he had thought the Hahoe Mask was backed by an organization that rivaled the 30 great guilds in power.</span></p><p><span style="">However, Eric Gomes recently started to have doubts about this assumption. &#xA0;If the Hahoe Mask had backers, the forces behind him should have started their operation already unless they were stupid. &#xA0;Moreover, if they refused to reveal their identity up to now, they probably would refuse to &#xA0;reveal their identity in the future.</span></p><p><span style="">Basically, Hahoe Mask was by himself. &#xA0;He was a Solo Player. &#xA0;He played this game by himself.</span></p><p><span style="">Eric Gomes calibrated his thoughts based on this assumption.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Warlord isn&apos;t a game one can solo. &#xA0;Up until now, the Hahoe Mask reaped the rewards by taking over tables that had already been set.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">In the Immoral Prince episode, it seemed as if the Hahoe Mask did everything by himself, but he had walked a road paved by countless number of dead Users. &#xA0;He only planted a flag on top of the peak.</span></p><p><span style="">Would the Hahoe Mask been able to stop the great battle by himself?</span></p><p><span style="">Even in the Argardo raid, could he have done it without the help from the Red Bulls guild?</span></p><p><span style="">In the recent Raid, he would have failed without the help of the Stormhunters guild. &#xA0;The Five Stars would have shut him down if he hadn&#x2019;t had help. </span></p><p><span style="">This was the key point.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;We tried to use the Hahoe Mask, and the Hahoe Mask used us instead. &#xA0;I have to give up on the idea of using the Hahoe Mask. If I do so, only the disrupters would be left around the Hahoe Mask. &#xA0;In the end, the Hahoe Mask will come against a wall.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">The Hahoe Mask wouldn&apos;t be able to do this alone.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;If the Hahoe Mask is able to monopolize the content by himself...&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">If he could do it without the help of others...</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Then his destiny was already set in stone by god.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">At that point, a destiny like that couldn&apos;t be dodged.</span></p>
