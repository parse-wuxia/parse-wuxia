<p><span style="">Chapter 159 &#x2013; Catch it or Be Caught (2)</span></p><p>4.</p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Do you know the Watchman Style?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">A User wearing the Hahoe Mask asked the question. &#xA0;He was standing with his sword resting on his shoulder. &#xA0;Instead of an answer, the magician unfurled his middle fingers to flip him off.</span></p><p><span style="">The User wearing the Hahoe Mask snorted at the magician&apos;s response.</span></p><p><span style="">Poohk! </span></p><p><span style="">The magician sat on the floor with a mocking smile on his face. &#xA0;Hyrkan stabbed his sword through the magician&apos;s chest. </span></p><p><span style="">After being stabbed by the sword, the magician fell backwards. &#xA0;When the back of the magician touched the ground, the sword embedded itself deep into the ground. &#xA0;The sword in the magician&apos;s chest took root.</span></p><p><span style="">When the magician was pierced by the sword, he didn&apos;t react in any way. &#xA0;He wasn&apos;t dead, but he was basically like a corpse.</span></p><p><span style="">Forced Logout.</span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan had the pleasure of watching the magician&apos;s death live, and the magician had given a token resistance. &#xA0;Hyrkan gave him what he deserved.</span></p><p><span style="">Poohk, poohk!</span></p><p><span style="">He gave the body just enough damage that it would kill the magician. &#xA0;He didn&apos;t abuse the corpse in anger.</span></p><p><span style="">After finishing his hunt, Hyrkan immediately became a hyena. &#xA0;He searched the magician&apos;s body then he took the wristwatch.</span></p><p><span style="">He put the Items into the Black Box, which he had strapped on like a backpack. &#xA0;A variety of consumable Items and four wristwatches was inside the box. </span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;This brings the total number up to five.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan added the 5th wristwatch into the Black Box. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">Instead of moving on to his next target, he let out a long sigh. &#xA0;It was the first time he had let one out since the mess had started.</span></p><p><span style="">The sigh was like a comma that allowed him to take a breather from the commotion.</span></p><p><span style="">After Anugas made its appearance, everything had turned into a perfect shit storm. &#xA0;The Big smiles and the Clover unit decided to spread out in all direction to catch Hyrkan.</span></p><p><span style="">They had realized that a battle with Anugas was impossible. &#xA0;A one-sided slaughter awaited them if they faced Anugas. &#xA0;They came to this realization when 2 Strikers, who represented the Clover unit was killed, and RootBeer lost his left arm in his escape.</span></p><p><span style="">Afterwards, Hyrkan immediately recovered the Black Box he had left behind, and he flipped roles by becoming the hunter.</span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan wasn&apos;t gracious enough to let go of opponents, who had messed with him.</span></p><p><span style="">This was something beyond being greedy for wristwatches and loots. &#xA0;They dared to push Hyrkan into the brink of suffering a Game Over. &#xA0;Hyrkan had to retaliate in such a way that they would never forget about crossing him.</span></p><p><span style="">However, it was time for him to end his quest for retribution.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;If I do more than this, I&apos;ll get caught by Anugas. &#xA0;That&apos;ll be the end of me.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan checked the status of his magic. &#xA0;Currently, his magical energy was recovering. &#xA0;It meant that the open-eyed Anugas wasn&apos;t nearby.</span></p><p><span style="">However, this didn&apos;t mean Hyrkan could be at ease. &#xA0;There was always the possibility of Anugas tracking him with its eye closed. &#xA0;While its eye was closed, its Special Ability didn&apos;t activate. &#xA0;Anugas&apos; ability only manifested when it was about to appear in front of the target it tracked down.</span></p><p><span style="">Basically, it was too late when one&apos;s magic disappeared.</span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan clicked his tongue.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;This is why I hate illusion type monsters.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">Illusion Type.</span></p><p><span style="">It was a new type of monster, which appeared in the Black Continent, in the Ruined Kingdom Episode.</span></p><p><span style="">Illusion.</span></p><p><span style="">It is as the word said. &#xA0;The body of the monster that one could see wasn&apos;t the real body.</span></p><p><span style="">If one delved deeper into the background story, one would find that these monsters were created artificially. &#xA0;A dragon used its power in the distant past to create an army as a means to defeat an ancient kingdom. &#xA0;Anugas was a member of the Dragon&apos;s army.</span></p><p><span style="">The Frost Knight and the Blaze Slime Dragon were similar type monsters.</span></p><p><span style="">One of the biggest characteristic for this Illusion type monsters was the fact that they could ignore the constraints of terrains.</span></p><p><span style="">The most classic case of this feature being used was the Blaze Slime Dragon. &#xA0;When the Blaze Slime Dragon was at a disadvantage, it gave up on its territory.</span></p><p><span style="">In the case of Anugas, it moved in a shape that others couldn&apos;t see, and it appeared only when a battle had started. &#xA0;Moreover, there were those that could swim through the ground as if it was in an ocean, and some monsters could even ride a shadow.</span></p><p><span style="">This was obvious, but even if monsters had the same Spec, the difficulty level depended on the Illusion type monster&apos;s special characteristic. &#xA0;The difference in difficulty could be night and day.</span></p><p><span style="">Basically, all the past experiences regarding hunting monsters were useless here. &#xA0;If one exaggerated the situation a little bit, one could say the Users were facing a situation akin to what they faced in the beginning of the game.</span></p><p><span style="">On top of it all, Anugas was the most difficult Illusion type Boss Monster.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Of all the monsters, why did Anugas have to show up? &#xA0;I&apos;m pretty sure it isn&apos;t suppose to come out at this point in the game.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hoo-ooh!&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan once again let out a sigh.</span></p><p><span style="">It wasn&apos;t a sigh of relief that came from his life having been spared.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Ah. &#xA0;This is driving me nuts.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">It was a sigh in regards to the horrible reality he would have to face.</span></p><p>5.</p><p><span style="">&#x2018;How could things get fucked up so badly?&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">Sinclair had received live reports as the events occurred. &#xA0;When he once again summarized the situation, Sinclair was baffled.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Were we unlucky? &#xA0;Or was this also a ploy that was pulled off by the Hahoe Mask?&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">The Hahoe Mask was the biggest fish amongst the big fishes, and the opportunity to catch him was right in front of their noses. &#xA0;He had thought it would be safe to say the fish had been caught. &#xA0;Basically, the hook had been dislodged from the fish&apos;s mouth, and the only thing left was to take a commemorative photo.</span></p><p><span style="">He received a live report stating RootBeer and the Hahoe Mask was exchanging blows, and the team was in position to attack. &#xA0;Sinclair made a fist. &#xA0;He had jumped the gun, and he had already started his victory ceremony. &#xA0;He thought he had it in the bag.</span></p><p><span style="">However, it was all ruined when the bastard called Anugas suddenly made an appearance.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;I know there are a lot of unreasonable monsters out there, but....&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">Anugas had appeared alongside Hyrkan. &#xA0;Sinclair spent more time in the game of Warlord than reality, yet he was having a hard time judging the capabilities of this monster.</span></p><p><span style="">It could hunt down its prey without showing any outward signs. &#xA0;When it appeared, it &#xA0;pretty much nullified the nearby Users&apos; magic, magic recovery and the effects of the magic recovery Items. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">It had a terrifying Special Ability!</span></p><p><span style="">They had been very fortunate in the fact that only 7 members from the Clover unit and Big Smiles guild members had died.</span></p><p><span style="">Sinclair was now able to organize his thoughts after seeing Anugas&apos; Special Ability, yet he couldn&apos;t come up with a plan to defeat the monster.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;So this is what they meant when they coined the term Over Balancing......&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">Sinclair had immediately sent a short report in regards to the Special Ability of Anugas to his superiors. &#xA0;During their last exchange, he was ordered not to go after Anugas.</span></p><p><span style="">In truth, even if he had been ordered not to do so, Sinclair wouldn&#x2019;t have wanted to fight this monster. &#xA0;Moreover, Sinclair didn&apos;t think there was any User in Warlord, who could kill this monster. </span></p><p><span style="">Even the Hahoe Mask had run away from Anugas. &#xA0;Unfortunately, the Clover unit got caught up in this mess. </span></p><p><span style="">At that moment, Sinclair&apos;s thoughts on what he would do changed.</span></p><p><span style="">To be precise, his orders had changed.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Still, this might be to my benefit.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">He needed to research it further, but he had discerned that Anugas used the Heard Fortress as its base.</span></p><p><span style="">This was only a conjecture, but there was a high probability that the Heard Fortress would become the first foothold within the Black Continent once Anugas was killed. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">Basically, the Black Continent will continue to be a harsh stage. &#xA0;It won&apos;t allow the Users to progress in the game comfortably unless Anugas was killed. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">At the same time, it seemed inevitable that the Users would become stalled in front of Anugas. &#xA0;It would be the start to a gridlock.</span></p><p><span style="">In this process, the ones that would gain the most would be the 5 guilds, who were trying to monopolize the Black Continent.</span></p><p><span style="">Currently, the influence of the 5 guilds were absolute in the Black Continent. &#xA0;In such a situation, Anugas would make this place a birdcage with no exit. Basically, the other Users in the Black Continent was like rats in a hole.</span></p><p><span style="">Moreover, the rat he wanted to catch the most was within this hole.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;We&apos;ve located the location of the Stormhunters guild. &#xA0;For the near future, the Hahoe Mask will probably operate out of the newly opened region. If I want to catch him, I&apos;ll be able to.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">He had failed in catching the Hahoe Mask this time, but while Anugas was still alive, he&apos;ll be able to attack the Hahoe Mask as many time as he wanted.</span></p><p><span style="">Sinclair had work to do now.</span></p><p><span style="">- Do you know the Watchman style?</span></p><p><span style="">Hahoe Mask&apos;s voice flowed out from the video at that moment. &#xA0;It was a footage sent by a fallen User affiliated with the Clover unit. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">Of course, this was all coincidences.</span></p><p><span style="">Sinclair put on a big frown when faced with such coincidences.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;I&apos;ll kill you no matter what, Hahoe Mask.&#x2019;</span></p><p>6.</p><p><span style="">The coffee made by the capsule coffee machine was overflowing with flavor, yet he dropped grape candies into it. &#xA0;Ahn-jaehyun brought the coffee cup to his mouth as he looked at the 6S V-Gear he purchased recently. &#xA0;The machine was quite splendid.</span></p><p><span style="">This item was many times more expensive than the security deposit of his one room apartment. &#xA0;This caused the installation engineers, who had come to install the 6S Model V-Gear, look at him with great suspicion.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Fuck.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Even as he looked at the V-Gear, cuss words roughly came out of his mouth. &#xA0;Maybe it was thanks to the luxurious coffee, but his mouth was filled with the smell of coffee as he let out a torrent of swear words. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">Anh-jaehyun didn&apos;t have a deep understanding about the flavors of coffee, and he didn&apos;t have the presence of mind to pay attention to such things.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;How did everything get so tangled up?&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">Ahn-jaehyun sipped his coffee. &#xA0;His expression expressed more than anger. &#xA0;It looked as if he was about to cry.</span></p><p><span style="">The reason being...</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Catch it or be caught.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">The position he found himself in right now was the cause of these emotions.</span></p><p><span style="">Of course, the root of his worries was Anugas.</span></p><p><span style="">His life was saved thanks to Anugas. &#xA0;However, he wasn&apos;t in a situation where he could celebrate this fact.</span></p><p><span style="">Anugas had appeared as the boss of the Heard Fortress.</span></p><p><span style="">He couldn&apos;t turn the Heard Fortress into a foothold until he killed Anugas. He had to kill the bastard, then he had to go to the ravine that was located beyond the Heard Fortress... &#xA0;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">If he was successful, he would be able to walk past the Block Field .</span></p><p><span style="">Anugas wasn&apos;t simply a stumbling block. &#xA0;It was an obstructor that prevented the Users from progressing along the road.</span></p><p><span style="">If he wasn&apos;t able to catch Anugas, the group of Users on his tails would catch up to him. &#xA0;Ahn-jaehyun would be caught.</span></p><p><span style="">He had to catch it or he&#x2019;ll be caught.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Why the hell is Anugas showing up at this point in time? &#xA0;He shouldn&apos;t be out yet.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">In truth, Ahn-jaehyun hadn&apos;t been able to predict this.</span></p><p><span style="">To his knowledge, Anugas appeared about 2 months after the Blaze Slime Dragon was caught. &#xA0;At the time, the Users were near level 230 when they faced Anugas. &#xA0;The Users were able to somewhat acclimatize to the Black Continent as they went through a big Spec Up using the 2nd Advancement and the Ancient Power.</span></p><p><span style="">Despite all of this, it hadn&apos;t been easy to take down Anugas.</span></p><p><span style="">Ahn-jaehyun could clearly remember the result.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Sweepers, Red Bulls and the Triple Wing.... &#xA0;The three of them had to team up to take it down.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">The Sweepers guild boasted the strongest magical fire power amongst the 30 great guilds. &#xA0;The Red Bull possessed many Tankers. &#xA0;Then there was the Triple Wings, who possessed a massive number of guild members on par with the Big Smiles guild. &#xA0;The combined forces of these 3 guilds failed twice, and the prior failed experiences were the foundation in how they succeeded in their third Raid attempt.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Is it a Balancing error?&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">The appearance of Anugas meant the Warlord&apos;s game system thought this was the right time for this Boss Monster to show up right now.</span></p><p><span style="">From Ahn-jaehyun&apos;s perspective, it didn&apos;t make sense for it to show up right now.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Then there&apos;s the appearance of Frost and Fire, which are Mythos rank powers... &#xA0;The events that should be happening couple months in the future are happening consecutively right now.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">Ahn-jaehyun shook his head from side to side, and his glasses went askew. &#xA0;Ahn-jaehyun repositioned his glasses. </span></p><p><span style="">However, Ahn-jaehyun didn&apos;t have the luxury to worry and ponder about the Warlord&apos;s system.</span></p><p><span style="">The core issue hadn&apos;t change.</span></p><p><span style="">If he wasn&apos;t able to catch Anugas, Hyrkan would be caught. </span></p><p><span style="">Who&apos;ll catch him? &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">He&apos;ll be caught by the 5 guilds, which included V&amp;V and the Big Smiles guild.</span></p><p><span style="">The Hahoe Mask had already confirmed their intention with his body. &#xA0;Moreover, he had felt the might of the people gunning for him.</span></p><p><span style="">The Clover unit was strong. &#xA0;If it hadn&apos;t been for Anugas, Ahn-jaehyun would be drinking alcohol instead of coffee right now.</span></p><p><span style="">Still, it would be impossible to operate in the Black Continent with Anugas on the loose. &#xA0;The raw number of members brought over by the 5 guilds into the Black Continent was too much.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;If someone else can catch it....&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">Of course, he could evade danger until someone else took down Anugas. &#xA0;This was one of the options he could choose.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;&#xB7;&#xB7;&#xB7;&#xB7;&#xB7;but it is unlikely.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">However, this wasn&apos;t the answer either.</span></p><p><span style="">One needed the 30 great guilds to step forward if one wanted others to catch Anugas. &#xA0;However, there hadn&apos;t been many of 30 great guilds, who chose to enter the Black Continent right now. &#xA0;Most of the forces in the Black Continent was from the 5 guilds, who had allied with each other. &#xA0;The other 30 great guilds lost the motivation to cross when they saw the queue they&#x2019;ll have to wait out until they&#x2019;ll be able cross the Voodook&apos;s tunnel.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;The 5 guilds don&apos;t have the incentive to catch Anugas right now.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">It was actually beneficial for the 5 guilds to leave Anugas in place. &#xA0;Their first mission would be to take out the Hahoe Mask and the Stormhunters guild, who will eventually become trouble in the future. &#xA0;Moreover, they would be easier to catch than Anugas.</span></p><p><span style="">Then there was the last option.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;If it&apos;s the Stormhunters.....&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">The Stormhunters guild also had some staying power here. &#xA0;They had enough forces to attempt the Anugas raid, and they had enough power to have a chance of winning.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;If it&apos;s the crazy bitch, she would try it.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">On top of everything, the one leading the guild was the Storm Queen Shir. &#xA0;Even Ahn-jaehyun considered her to be a crazy bitch. &#xA0;If she had a bone to pick, she would fight even if the battle looked impossible.</span></p><p><span style="">However, Ahn-jaehyun didn&apos;t consider the probability of her succeeding the Anugas Raid to be high. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">Unless Ahn-jaehyun told them how to clear this Raid, the probability of them succeeding was in the single digits.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Fuck.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">At that moment, a cuss word came out again from Ahn-jaehyun&apos;s mouth.</span></p><p><span style="">This wasn&#x2019;t a cuss word that came out because the series of worries he had.</span></p><p><span style="">In truth, it was an attempt for him to avoid reality.</span></p><p><span style="">Ahn-jaehyun had only one answer he could choose.</span></p><p><span style="">Catch, or be Caught</span></p><p><span style="">Ahn-jaehyun didn&apos;t plan on being caught. &#xA0;He&apos;d rather die at the hand of Anugas than be killed by the 5 guilds.</span></p><p><span style="">There was only one answer left.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;This fucking game.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Ahn-jaehyun started a simulation of the Anugas raid inside his head.</span></p>
