<p><span style="">Chapter 121 - Bad Ending? (2)</span></p><p>5.</p><p><span style="">- Another castle fell. &#xA0;What number is that one?</span></p><p><span style="">- I don&apos;t care. &#xA0;It is already in ruins. &#xA0;No matter what we do there isn&apos;t an answer. &#xA0;This great battle is a bug! </span></p><p><span style="">- I feel the same way. The great battle is a completely trash of a quest. &#xA0;The difficulty is too high!</span></p><p><span style="">It was the 10 days after the great battle had started.</span></p><p><span style="">Everyone thought the great battle would be a festival, but it had been a complete disaster from the start. This situation was akin to a drunk host showing up at a much anticipated party. &#xA0;Moreover, as the host was carrying out his duties, he threw up. &#xA0;This was that level of a disaster. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">Every one of the battles fought by the Users had resulted in a defeat. &#xA0;The results were so sorry that it was hard to call it a war between the Users and the Corrupted army. &#xA0;The Users were losing in a very overwhelming fashion.</span></p><p><span style="">Of course, a stumble may prevent a fall. &#xA0;In a war, victories and defeats were inevitable. &#xA0;However, if one saw the the progress of the battles live, one wouldn&apos;t dare utter such a proverb.</span></p><p><span style="">- This isn&apos;t about the high difficulty. &#xA0;The Users are just dumb. &#xA0;Shouldn&apos;t the blame for the losses be more on the Users?</span></p><p><span style="">- I feel the same way. &#xA0;I can overlook the fact that they aren&apos;t in sync. &#xA0;However, they are fighting with allies when the enemies are right in front of them. &#xA0;Their actions doesn&apos;t make any sense. This is quite a mess.</span></p><p><span style="">This was how underwhelming the sight of the Users fighting against the Corrupted army was. &#xA0;It was well below expectation. No, this was beyond being below expectation. &#xA0;It almost defied common sense.</span></p><p><span style="">- Mess? Maybe you should try fighting them yourself! Do you really think you&apos;ll do any better?</span></p><p><span style="">- You bastards don&apos;t even know how to play this game. &#xA0;Why don&apos;t you guys come over and participate?</span></p><p><span style="">- It is a mess! The heavyweight like the Hahoe Mask is putting up a proper fight! </span></p><p><span style="">- Aren&apos;t the Fighters guild doing well too? Whistling Pitbull is doing especially well. He still had the skills he displayed in his earlier fame. &#xA0;No, he looks to be much scarier than before.</span></p><p><span style="">- There is a team made by Users, and aren&apos;t they doing well? &#xA0;Their name is Kiyo or whatever. &#xA0;In truth, we are in this predicament, because of the regular Users. &#xA0;Those who were good at this game are continuing to excel in this game.</span></p><p><span style="">Of course, not everyone was failing in the great battle.</span></p><p><span style="">Heroes always appeared in the times of turbulence. &#xA0;After the initial confusion, the turbulence allowed Users to distinguish themselves. Some Users were shining brighter than ever.</span></p><p><span style="">- Anyways, Hahoe Mask is the best.</span></p><p><span style="">- I&apos;ll accept that. </span></p><p><span style="">Amongst the bright stars, the star called the Hahoe Mask shone the brightest.</span></p><p><span style="">- Even as the castle was falling, he was able to taken down several hundred monsters before he escaped. &#xA0;At the very least, everyone should show that level of spirit.</span></p><p><span style="">- If there were 10 Hahoe Masks, there&#x2019;s no way a castle would fall.</span></p><p><span style="">Hahoe Mask&apos;s performance was so bright that it was hard to put it into words.</span></p><p><span style="">Moreover, his actions were always a bit more dramatic. &#xA0;He wasn&apos;t like the undisciplined mob fighting outside of the castle. &#xA0;He started fighting the moment when the monsters entered the castle.</span></p><p><span style="">If one fought to the end, it makes one look noble. &#xA0;There was an element of nobleness in the Hahoe Mask&apos;s battles.</span></p><p><span style="">- Why does the Hahoe Mask never fight outside? &#xA0;Is he scheming something?</span></p><p><span style="">Of course, a portion of the viewers was suspicious as to why the Hahoe Mask hadn&apos;t fought a single battle outside of the castle.</span></p><p><span style="">- If it were you, do you really want to fight with such a retarded group of Users?</span></p><p><span style="">- If the Hahoe Mask fights outside of the castle, the Users would probably think his Skeletons are monsters. &#xA0;They&apos;ll probably attack his Skeletons.</span></p><p><span style="">- Don&apos;t even mention the Hahoe Mask&apos;s name with those retarded group.</span></p><p><span style="">However, the suspicion failed to develop into a conspiracy.</span></p><p><span style="">In the process of all this, Hahoe Mask&apos;s worth was increasing steeply. &#xA0;Hahoe Mask&apos;s youtube page had reached a plateau not too long ago. &#xA0;However, the subscribers and the views on previously uploaded videos started to rise again.</span></p><p><span style="">The great battle was a bigger issue than most had thought it would be, and the media was in a frenzy.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;We have to get an interview with the Hahoe Mask no matter what! Get him even if we have to plaster the request all over the newspapers!&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;If you can&apos;t contact him, go into Warlord to get an interview! Hurry up!&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;We are the Warlord&apos;s top webzine. We&apos;ve been chasing after an interview with the Hahoe Mask when the media wasn&apos;t even interested in him. &#xA0;I won&apos;t let them steal the interview from me. I won&apos;t stand for it. Use all of your personal connections. &#xA0;Get me that interview. &#xA0;If you can&apos;t get an interview, you guys are going to get it from me.</span></p><p><span style="">It happened around that time.</span></p><p><span style="">Hahoe Mask&apos;s popularity was reaching an all-time high. &#xA0;The media was getting ready to duke it out with each other to get ahold of the Hahoe Mask.</span></p><p><span style="">- Uh? What the hell is this? </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Uh? It seems the Hahoe Mask Interview isn&apos;t the important news right now.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">The interest in the Hahoe Mask disappeared as if it was a mirage. &#xA0;There was another news that pushed the Hahoe Mask into the backburner.</span></p><p>6.</p><p><span style="">[Hyrkan] </span></p><p><span style="">- Level : 165 </span></p><p><span style="">- Title : 132 </span></p><p><span style="">- Stats : Strength(1885)/Stamina(929)/Intelligence(1121)/Magic Power(1355) </span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;The bonus EXP from the great battle is awesome. &#xA0;I&apos;m leveling up quickly.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">As soon as he leveled up, he applied his points to his Stats. &#xA0;Hyrkan quickly closed his Stat Window, and he turned his head. When he turned his head, Hyrkan&apos;s eyes took in the miserable sight of the fallen Misandra&apos;s castle</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Tsk.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan had a lot of memories regarding the Misandra&apos;s castle. &#xA0;This sight made him feel saddened and frustrated. &#xA0;This sight discomforted him more so than any sight he had seen recently.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;I&apos;m finally at this point&#x2026;&#x2026;.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">However, Hyrkan didn&apos;t have the luxury to sentimentalize over his memories.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;This next part will be dangerous for the Users, who didn&apos;t participate in the great battle.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">The advance of the Corrupted army was much faster than he had expected.</span></p><p><span style="">This was the reason why the User would make the rational choice. </span></p><p><span style="">The Users won&#x2019;t be enticed by the chance to gain Items and a quick level up. &#xA0;The Users will start to realize this great battle was unlike anything they encountered in terms of difficulty. &#xA0;The Users would become hesitant in participating in the great war.</span></p><p><span style="">The Users, who wanted to fight in earnest, will try to find battlefields where their victories were assured. &#xA0;This would lead the Users to flock towards the Underfoot guilds like the Fighters guild. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">On the other hand, those who didn&#x2019;t want to fight would go to locations where defeat had already happened or they&#x2019;ll avoid locations being organized by groups like the Underfoot guilds.</span></p><p><span style="">This would lead to the gap between the rich and the poor getting bigger in terms of fighting power. &#xA0;The Corrupted army would attack the locations where the fighting power was poor.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;If the castles where the low level Users get taken down... Shit. &#xA0;I have no idea how everything will turn out.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">The Corrupted army will start heading towards locations with Users under level 100. &#xA0;These locations were now in the sight of the Corrupted army. &#xA0;They had already attacked the Misandra&#x2019;s Castle, which was a location meant for level 80 to level 100. &#xA0;Misandra&#x2019;s castle was the Maginot Line, and the Maginot Line had been broken. </span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;This is getting dangerous.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan had never thought such a situation would come to pass, and it was impossible to come up with a good plan on the spot.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;What the hell are the 30 great guilds doing? They profited from everything they could get their hands on, yet they are acting like this! &#xA0;They should spit back out everything they pocketed!&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">The only way to manage this situation was for the 30 great guilds to step in. &#xA0;This was the only solution in Hyrkan&apos;s opinion.</span></p><p><span style="">The 30 great guilds had massive amount of forces, and they could use their live channels to mobilize the Users. &#xA0;Their standing and brand amongst the Users allowed them to be able to unite the User base. This was the reason why the 30 great guilds were scary. They had a reserve of power they could tap. &#xA0;The 30 great guilds were able to mobilize the Users.</span></p><p><span style="">Before he came to the past, Hyrkan had experienced it in his bones when those bastards tapped into the reserve.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;They probably expressed their stance they&#x2019;ll take in this situation. &#xA0;Since the situation is devolving like this, they can&apos;t choose to be silent. &#xA0;These bastards are all greedy, so there is no way they&apos;ll &#xA0;bypass this bait. &#xA0;I&apos;m sure...&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan looked around his surrounding once again. &#xA0;The Misandra&apos;s castle was a mess, but there weren&apos;t any monsters near him that would cause him trouble. &#xA0;Hyrkan quickly searched the internet.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Huh? What the hell is this?&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">Fortunately, Hyrkan didn&apos;t have to search long to find what he wanted to know.</span></p><p>7.</p><p><span style="">Che-sulyun was soaking inside her bathtub. The bathtub was filled with bubbles, yet her collarbone was visible. Her appearance was very bewitching. There was a saying that said one&#x2019;s daily life was like picture in a magazine. &#xA0;This saying was apt.</span></p><p><span style="">Her hand was poking out of the bubbles, and her hand was holding onto her slim and half-translucent smart phone. &#xA0;The steam and bubble from bath didn&#x2019;t allow the phone to show a clear picture, but it wasn&#x2019;t that big of a deal. &#xA0;Che-sulyun was able to check what she wanted to know.</span></p><p><span style="">She was reading an article.</span></p><p><span style="">[The V&amp;V guild, Rangers guild, and 8 other guilds put out a joint statement stating they won&apos;t participate in the great battle!] </span></p><p><span style="">[This is from the V&amp;V and Rangers guild&#x2019;s statement. &#x2018;The great battle was a stage provided for all Users to be able to participate. &#xA0;If the 30 great guilds joined the festival, we&#x2019;ll be ruining the festival for the Users.&#x2019;] </span></p><p><span style="">[Will the great battle be a festival for the underdogs?] </span></p><p><span style="">Che-sulyun had an annoyed expression as she read the article. &#xA0;She let go of the smart phone, and it dropped to the bottom of the tub. As if Che-sulyun&#x2019;s body had slipped, she sank deeper into the tub. &#xA0;Her collarbones had been visible before, but only her head was visible now.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Fucking hell.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">Her figure was that of a goddess, yet her thoughts was very far from matching her appearance. &#xA0;All kinds of cuss words were &#xA0;floating around inside her head.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Are those bastards scheming to fuck us over?&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">A total of 9 guilds from the 30 great guilds announced that they won&#x2019;t be participating in the great battle. &#xA0;This included the V&amp;V guild.</span></p><p><span style="">The reception to the statement was very good.</span></p><p><span style="">- Wow! They came to a really big decision.</span></p><p><span style="">- Yes. &#xA0;They are the 30 great guilds. They should act magnanimous like this. &#xA0;The Main Scenario Quest can be carried out by everyone. &#xA0;If the 30 great guilds monopolize it, wouldn&#x2019;t that be too unreasonable. &#xA0;I&#x2019;m being honest here.</span></p><p><span style="">- However, look at what is happening. &#xA0;Shouldn&apos;t the 30 great guilds step forward? &#xA0;I don&apos;t think the Users can pull this off.</span></p><p><span style="">- If we fail, we fail. &#xA0;It isn&apos;t as if they&apos;ll shut down the game. The important part is that the 30 great guilds won&apos;t decide our fate. &#xA0;The result will created by the Users.. </span></p><p><span style="">There was a flow of opinions at the bottom of the article. &#xA0;Even though public opinions shouldn&#x2019;t be gauged by the comments below an article, positive responses were much more numerous than the negative responses.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Crazy bastards. I can&apos;t believe there are people who believe in their bullshit.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">However, Che-sulyun knew the statement put out by the 9 guilds weren&#x2019;t words that rose out from the bottom of their hearts. &#xA0;If they really cared about the enjoyment the normal Users feel, they wouldn&#x2019;t have put out a join statement.</span></p><p><span style="">They were people who were incapable of doing such acts. They were doing this for the benefit of the Users? The 30 great guilds were a gathering of people, who would do anything for their own profits. &#xA0;As one of the Guild masters of the 30 great guilds, Che-sulyun knew her thoughts weren&#x2019;t wrong. &#xA0;She was sure of it.</span></p><p><span style="">This meant the 9 guilds had put out this joint statement, because they judged this course of action would lead to a profit for them. </span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;I&apos;m sure of it. If they are destined to become the maid of honor, they would rather spoil the whole thing.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">Profit didn&#x2019;t always have to involve gaining a material good. &#xA0;If they could block someone else from gaining a profit, at times that could be a profit in itself.</span></p><p><span style="">This was the case right now. &#xA0;The purpose behind the actions of 9 guilds were simple. &#xA0;They hadn&#x2019;t been able to receive the qualification to participate in the Immoral Prince Raid. &#xA0;There were 3 guilds, who had gained this qualification, and they had maneuvered it so that the 3 guilds wouldn&#x2019;t be able to also monopolize the great battle.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;In the end, it happened as the Helper said it would.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">Che-sulyun had known what the 9 guilds would do at a slightly earlier time..</span></p><p><span style="">Several guilds were getting ready to send out an announcement of non-participation.... </span></p><p><span style="">The Helpers were called when the 30 great guilds needed assistance. &#xA0;These Helpers were from the Hands guild, and they were the one who had informed her of this news.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;&#x2026;&#x2026;Helper. Those bastards are dangerous.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">She had found out about this news a little bit sooner than everyone. &#xA0;Of course, this didn&apos;t mean she had a solution to her problem.</span></p><p><span style="">At that moment, Che-sulyun looked at the Hands guild in an unfavorable manner even though they had given her an important piece of news.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;There is no way they gave me the information with good intent. &#xA0;Are they planning on pitting us against each other?&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">Everything about this made her suspicious. &#xA0;It got on her nerves, and she became annoyed. &#xA0;The good will gesture by the Hands guild just raised Che-sulyun&#x2019;s suspicion. &#xA0;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">In the end, Che-sulyun massaged her temples with her hands. &#xA0;Everything about this business was going to cause her a headache.</span></p><p><span style="">It was inevitable.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;I can&#x2019;t let go of the great battle like this&#x2026; However, we can&#x2019;t move right now.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">There was a crisis, yet the Stormhunters didn&#x2019;t have the right to fix the problem. &#xA0;Someone else would have to solve the problem for them. &#xA0;A scenario that Che-sulyun detested the most was unfolding in front of her.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;I need a justification. &#xA0;I need a justification that&apos;ll allow for one of the 30 great guilds to be able to step forward.&#x2026;&#x2026;.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">Ahn-jaehyun was busily sorting through the articles on the internet. &#xA0;He was busily gathering information, and the LCD display of the Tablet PC was smudged with his fingerprints. &#xA0;Ahn-jaehyun raised the coffee cup that was placed next to him. &#xA0;The coffee cup was lukewarm, but Ahn-jaehyun&apos;s hands was shaking. &#xA0;It shook as if his hand was weak.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;This is driving me nuts.&#x2019;</span></p><p>8.</p><p><span style="">Ahn-jaehyun was nervous.</span></p><p><span style="">Ahn-jaehyun was human. &#xA0;Of course, he got nervous. &#xA0;He had done many task in Warlord where he had felt nervous. &#xA0;The nervousness he felt was indescribable when he fought against the Boss monsters. &#xA0;When he logged off after finishing the raid, &#xA0;there were times when he had goose bumps all over his body when he took off his V-Gear.</span></p><p><span style="">However, the nervousness he was feeling right now was a different type of nervousness.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;If things head down this path&#x2026;&#x2026; I&apos;m fucked.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">Nine guilds announced that their guilds wouldn&apos;t participate in the great battle! </span></p><p><span style="">Ahn-jaehyun didn&apos;t recall this happening before. &#xA0;Before Ahn-jaehyun returned to the past, the 30 great guild had all joined the great battle, and they fought alongside each other in a competitive manner. &#xA0;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">Of course, Ahn-jaehyun had created big commotion. &#xA0;The future before he had returned to the past would be different from the future he was forging right now. A tornado on the other side of earth could be influenced by the flapping of the wings of a butterfly. &#xA0;Ahn-jaehyun&apos;s activities wasn&apos;t akin to a butterfly flapping its wings. &#xA0;His level of activity was like poking a beehive with a stick.</span></p><p><span style="">Change was inevitable.</span></p><p><span style="">However, the current change was very dangerous for Ahn-jaehyun.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;If things head down this way, the Quest Routes will change.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">Everything in Warlord was controlled by the AI. &#xA0;This was the case for the Main Scenario Quests.</span></p><p><span style="">For example, when the Users progressed in the game, the AI used the User&#x2019;s level to calculate the difficulty of the Main Scenario Quest.</span></p><p><span style="">Unlike his worries from before, he didn&#x2019;t think the AI would allow the Corrupted Army to be able to conquer all the castles. &#xA0;Or else it would result in the Immoral Prince rising to the throne. &#xA0;He didn&#x2019;t think the game would send out a message saying, &#x2018;Thank you for using Warlord until now.&#x2019; &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">However, this might change the third Main Scenario Quest that starts after the Immoral Prince episode. &#xA0;The Quest Contents and Quest Routes for the Ruined Kingdom Episode would be completely changed from what Ahn-jaehyun remembered. </span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;I can&#x2019;t let that happen.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">If that happened, Ahn-jaheyun wouldn&#x2019;t be able to have an active role in the Ruined Kingdom episode.</span></p><p><span style="">Whether he had an active role or not wasn&#x2019;t the problem. &#xA0;If the Immoral Prince episode was where Ahn-jaehyun caught up with the frontrunners, the Ruined Kingdom episode was the stage where he planned on leapfrogging the frontrunners. &#xA0;If he had to give up that stage, it would basically mean he would be giving up on the reason why he was playing Warlord.</span></p><p><span style="">In the end, Ahn-jaehyun didn&#x2019;t have a choice.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;I have to use whatever means necessary to bring victory to the Users in the great battle.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">Ultimately, the great battle couldn&#x2019;t end with the Users losing.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;If things play out this way, the game would be fine. &#xA0;However, my life would meet a bad ending.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">He had to use whatever means possible to drag the Users to victory. &#xA0;However, it was absurd to expect victory in the great battle just by relying on the Users. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">In the end, there was only one method he could use.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;&#x2026;&#x2026;this reminds of the time when I had to hard carry the kids at the bottom in Warlord.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">Hard Carry.</span></p><p><span style="">This was the only path that&#x2019;ll allow him to maintain his livelihood.</span></p>
