<p><span style="">Chapter 134 - Immoral Prince (2)</span></p><p>4.</p><p><span style="">People learned from defeat.</span></p><p><span style="">Of course, the two attempts at the Immoral Prince Raid ended in a crushing defeat, but at the same time, it was a chance to find out how to defeat the Immoral Prince.</span></p><p><span style="">Two roles needed to be filled to defeat the Immoral Prince.</span></p><p><span style="">There was the Relic Destroyer team, which eliminated the guardians defending the relics. &#xA0;Then there was the Prince Interference team. &#xA0;They had to constantly move to distract the Immoral Prince.</span></p><p><span style="">It wasn&apos;t too hard to destroy the Relics. The Relic Guardians were the type of monsters that had high defense and a lot of HP. &#xA0;Its attack power, attack pattern and skills were above average. &#xA0;It wasn&apos;t an easy monster to face, but the difficulty was much lower than the unusually scary monster called the White-eye Knight Argardo. </span></p><p><span style="">If one could buy time with the Immoral Prince, it was ok to have a small Relic Destroyer Team. &#xA0;It was possible to do the Immoral Prince Raid with a small group.</span></p><p><span style="">Basically, if Shir could occupy the Immoral Prince by herself, it was possible for the Stormhunters &#xA0;to accomplish their tasks even with a team of 25 Users.</span></p><p><span style="">Shir was confident about the plan. &#xA0;She was confident that she was stronger than anyone in Warlord. &#xA0;The only one that affected her opinion about this fact was the Hahoe Mask. &#xA0;However, even he could only affect her opinion. &#xA0;Shir thought very highly of the Hahoe Mask, but she had never thought she was worse than him.</span></p><p><span style="">Moreover, there was good reasons why she was able to have so much confidence in herself.</span></p><p><span style="">Immoral Prince.</span></p><p><span style="">The Blacksmith Olf had found a mysterious and marvelous metal that had been found by an ancient kingdom. &#xA0;Its existence hadn&apos;t even been recorded in history. &#xA0;Olf had created a very large ash-colored armor. &#xA0;Prince Dean was already a large man, but the armor made him look several times larger. Moreover, the helmet placed on top of this large armor looked different from normal helmets. &#xA0;It was shaped like a crown, and the helmet had a T-shaped opening where one should have been able to see the Immoral Prince&apos;s eyes. &#xA0;However, one could only see black light being emitted from where its eyes should be. &#xA0;Then there was the cape that was around his enormous armored body. &#xA0;It had the print of a trigonal symbol on it. There were three snakes biting each other&apos;s tail.</span></p><p><span style="">It made one breathless when see the dignity flowing off of the Immoral Prince. The thought of facing it was daunting, yet the Storm Queen lived up to her reputation... &#xA0;No, she was performing beyond her earned reputation.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;My god. &#xA0;She lasted for 5 minutes.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;In truth, I thought this was a suicidal mission. However, at this pace... Maybe we might succeed in this Raid.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">Five minutes. </span></p><p><span style="">This was the amount of time Shir had been able to occupy the Immoral Prince.</span></p><p><span style="">They weren&apos;t evenly matched, but the battle was a close call.</span></p><p><span style="">If she was an average expert, her body would have been flung backwards from the powerful attack. &#xA0;However, she just swayed once after she blocked the attack. &#xA0;Another powerful attack that would have destroyed her defensive gear and body was sent towards her. &#xA0;She was able to dodge it even though she had lost her balance. &#xA0;&#xA0;There was a overwhelming difference in their battle capability, but she refused to stay on the defensive. &#xA0;She went on the offensive against the Immoral Prince. &#xA0;She made it so that the Immoral Prince couldn&#x2019;t swing its sword properly. &#xA0;She was like a shield trying to bait attacks to defend.</span></p><p><span style="">It was a fierce fight.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hahui!&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes! &#xA0;I&#x2019;ll endure!&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">This was a hard fight with an asterisk attached to it.</span></p><p><span style="">At Shir&apos;s shout, Hahui threw herself towards the Immoral Prine.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;How dare you do that to the Queen! You are dead!&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">She had watched Shir&apos;s battle, and Hahui&apos;s body had been itching to carry out her mission. &#xA0;Hahui&apos;s charge was fierce.</span></p><p><span style="">While Hahui was facing off against the Immoral Prince, Shir backed out. &#xA0;The three Priests on standby crowded her as they started chanting their prayers. &#xA0;They had started to cast their buffs.</span></p><p><span style="">This was what allowed her to carry out this fierce battle. &#xA0;She had Full Buff. &#xA0;Five minutes was how long the Buffs were active.</span></p><p><span style="">Of course, one couldn&apos;t disparage her skill for this reason. &#xA0;The Immoral Prince was strong. This became immediately apparent when it fought against Hahui. &#xA0;She had similar Specs as Shir, and she had also received the Full Buff. &#xA0;However, Hahui received a critical wound only after 1 minute had passed.</span></p><p><span style="">She was unable to parry the sword swung by the Immoral Prince. &#xA0;Hahui&apos;s left arm flew backwards.</span></p><p><span style="">Shweeek! &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">In a flash, the Immoral Prince had sliced through her elbow.</span></p><p><span style="">While Hahui was flustered, three Striker on standby charged towards the Immoral Prince. &#xA0;Two of them attempted an attack on the Immoral Prince, and the remaining Striker exited the battlefield carrying Hahui like a luggage.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I can do this! &#xA0;I can hang on!&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Hahui struggled, but her arm had been severed. &#xA0;Of course, her movements were weakened compared to her normal self.</span></p><p><span style="">As they bought time, Shir had once again received a Full Buff. &#xA0;She let out a yell.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I&apos;m ready!&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">The Priests and Swordsmen engaged in the battle ebbed away, and Shir once again charged towards the Immoral Prince like an arrow.</span></p><p><span style="">Then everyone wordlessly watched the battle that had started up once again.</span></p><p>5.</p><p><span style="">The Iron Golem wasn&apos;t that small. &#xA0;It possessed a body that was 3 meters tall, and a diamond larger than a man&apos;s fist was placed on the crown of the Iron Golem&apos;s head. &#xA0;The diamond was embedded in so deep that it couldn&apos;t be extracted unless the Golem&apos;s iron head was split open.</span></p><p><span style="">It was the Relic Guardian.</span></p><p><span style="">There was two Tankers in front of the Relic Guardian, and they were constantly drawing its aggro.</span></p><p><span style="">During all of this, a magician was circling around the golem at a high speed.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Position! &#xA0;Get in position! &#xA0;Just stay as you are. &#xA0;I&apos;ll work around you!&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Ballista Hatch. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">Normally, he was known for his unfunny sketches with Hahui. &#xA0;He was someone who always complained. &#xA0;Unlike his ridiculous and lame look, he was one of the top 5 Magicians in Warlord. &#xA0;He was incredibly skilled.</span></p><p><span style="">His specialty was using the Moving Casting skill in battle. &#xA0;He was able to move constantly in battle, yet he was always accurate with his strike.</span></p><p><span style="">Of course, he wasn&apos;t moving just for the sake of moving. &#xA0;His constant movements had a purpose. &#xA0;He was able to dodge the attack of enemies in real time, and it lessened the burden placed on the Tankers. &#xA0;He could move around the monsters engaged with the Tankers. &#xA0;This meant the Tankers didn&apos;t have to lure the monsters towards a specific location or a direction. &#xA0;Hatch would find the location and timing of his attack on his own.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Don&apos;t over do it! &#xA0;I&apos;ll take the aggro, and while I buy some time, you guys brace up for battle! &#xA0;Give us another round of Buffs!&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">When the Tankers were about to falter, Ballista had drawn the aggro towards himself. &#xA0;While he was being chased, he kept using his magic. &#xA0;He was buying time, so his comrades could reform the battle line. &#xA0;Hatch was considered to be the number 1 magician every Tanker wanted to hunt with.</span></p><p><span style="">He clearly had an in depth knowledge about the monsters, and he had the ability to adapt to various situation adroitly. &#xA0;He was able to comprehend battle situations in real time, and he was able to come up with solutions through his analysis. &#xA0;He was also capable of commanding others. &#xA0;This was why Hatch had been the obvious choice to lead the hunt against the Relic Guardians.</span></p><p><span style="">Currently, the plan was progressing very smoothly and stably under the command of Hatch.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Full Buff is complete.!&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;The next Tanker will take on the Aggro.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">It had been 7 minutes since they started the battle with the Relic Guardian. &#xA0;There hadn&apos;t been any casualties or even injuries during that time. &#xA0;If 100 was the full score, his great command would be scored at over a 90.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;This isn&apos;t that hard, but&#x2026;&#x2026;.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">However, Hatch wasn&apos;t satisfied with the battle.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;This might take longer than expected.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">The battle was smooth, but there was no breaks. &#xA0;Moreover, the speed of the battle was changing constantly.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;We&#x2019;ve hit it numerous time, yet it is showing only a crack&#x2026;. &#xA0;I never expected it to be like this. &#xA0;At the very least, we&#x2019;ll need 15 minutes to catch it. &#xA0;If we are to catch the other Guardians, it would take over 40 minutes&#x2026;..&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">At that moment, Hatch thought about the update he heard a moment ago.</span></p><p><span style="">Shir&apos;s first engagement had lasted 5 minutes. &#xA0;Hatch had be very surprised at the news. &#xA0;Shir had said she would buy enough time for them, but he had never expected her to keep her word.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;The Queen is a monster amongst monsters.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">When he heard the news, his faith in his leader was renewed. &#xA0;She was an incredible woman. &#xA0;Her amazing ability allowed Shir to run the guild in a near dictatorship, and all the guild members followed her. &#xA0;Shir didn&#x2019;t hesitate or back down from any problems, and she was always in the frontlines to make the breakthrough</span></p><p><span style="">However, the following update made Hatch&#x2019;s heart feel heavy. </span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;&#x2026;&#x2026;however, the rest of us are just merely good at gaming.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">He had heard Hahui had barely lasted a minute, and her arm had been severed. &#xA0;He didn&apos;t look down on Hahui&apos;s skills. &#xA0;He was well aware of the skill difference between Shir and Hahui. &#xA0;There was no way there was such a large gap in skills. &#xA0;It wasn&#x2019;t large a enough of difference where one would have lasted a minute and the other lasted 5 minutes.</span></p><p><span style="">This meant one of them was overworking herself.</span></p><p><span style="">Shir had boldly declared that she would be able to last for an hour, but from Hatch&apos;s perspective, he estimated she would last about 15 minutes. &#xA0;He was willing to bet his 2 years of experience that the situation would deteriorate towards the end of the 3rd exchange with the Immoral Prince.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Shit. &#xA0;Why aren&apos;t those bastards contacting me?&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">In the end, they needed outside help. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">It was as if they had read Hatch&#x2019;s mind.</span></p><p><span style="">An urgent news arrived.</span></p><p><span style="">- This is bad! The Hydra Guild and the Red Bulls Guild just started their live Immoral Prince broadcast! </span></p><p><span style="">The fact that the two guilds had started their broadcast meant the two guilds were already here.</span></p><p><span style="">Hatch closed his mouth tight.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Yes. &#xA0;Instead of losing everything, it is better to gain something. &#xA0;This is the right thing to do.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">He knew he wouldn&apos;t receive praise for his actions. &#xA0;However, in Hatch&apos;s judgement, he was sure his plan would bring a better result than Shir&apos;s plan of doing this alone.</span></p><p><span style="">- The two guilds have announced their plan. &#xA0;They are going to destroy the Relic Guardians, while the Stormhunters act as bait..... &#xA0;Did we agree to this?</span></p><p><span style="">However, Hatch&apos;s expression didn&apos;t last long. &#xA0;His firmly closed mouth unconsciously dropped open.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Ah.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">Hatch realized it at that moment.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;These assholes are trying to fuck us&#x2026;.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">The people he had called in were tigers, and he had briefly forgotten about this fact. &#xA0;However, he realized that truth at that moment.</span></p><p>6.</p><p><span style="">When the Red Bulls guild and the Hydra guild entered the Immoral Prince raid, they didn&apos;t even bother speaking to the Stormhunters. &#xA0;They immediately started to hunt down the Relic Guardians. The two guilds moved in perfect sync to catch the Relic Guardians. &#xA0;It looked as if the three guilds had planned this. &#xA0;It looked as if the Raid had been planned like a surprise party.</span></p><p><span style="">From the outside, the three guilds were perfectly in sync in their actions.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Which son of a bitch was it!&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Of course, from the Stormhunters&apos; perspective, they couldn&apos;t help, but let out curse words. &#xA0;Actually, the current raid was being broadcasted on the Stormhunters&apos; live channel, and Hahui was continuously spitting out swear words. &#xA0;She was about to drop everything and attack the Red Bulls or the Hydra guild.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Which son of a bitch betrayed us!&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Fortunately, Hahui had made several accidents in the past, so there had been measures taken. &#xA0;Her words didn&#x2019;t come out through the broadcast speakers.</span></p><p><span style="">Anyway, she was rightfully angry. &#xA0;It was understandable. &#xA0;This mission wasn&#x2019;t known to outsiders, so there shouldn&apos;t have been any intervention or intrusion.</span></p><p><span style="">In other words, there was most definitely a betrayer amongst them. &#xA0;Since she was channeling their anger for them, the guild members didn&#x2019;t commit any rash acts. &#xA0;In such an atmosphere of anger, if someone who represented their anger spoke, they would naturally listen to her words.</span></p><p><span style="">Of course, there was only one person that could give an answer to her question.</span></p><p><span style="">It was the betrayer. </span></p><p><span style="">- It was me. &#xA0;I passed along the information to the other two guilds.</span></p><p><span style="">At that moment, Hatch confessed the fact that he was the betrayer. &#xA0;At that moment, everyone shut their eyes tight.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Of all the&#x2026;&#x2026;.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">Everyone expected Hahui to yell in an earsplitting rage. &#xA0;They were sure she was going to let out a thunderous roar towards Hatch.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Uh? &#xA0;Why? &#xA0;Really? &#xA0;Why did you do it?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">However, Hahui&apos;s response was unexpected. &#xA0;Instead of anger, she asked questions that was filled with genuine shock. &#xA0;Even the guild members that had known her for a long time had never seen this side of her before.</span></p><p><span style="">This instead made everyone become more flustered.</span></p><p><span style="">Hatch&apos;s betrayal.... &#xA0;They were having a hard time accepting it. &#xA0;Hatch always complained, but he was someone who worked harder than anyone for the Stormhunters. </span></p><p><span style="">Moreover, what did he gain from betraying them? </span></p><p><span style="">No matter what angle they looked at it, Hatch didn&#x2019;t have much to gain from this betrayal.</span></p><p><span style="">On top it all, Hahui&#x2019;s reaction added to the confusion.</span></p><p><span style="">The confused atmosphere created a state of disorder.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Focus on the battle.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Shir was the one that organized the atmosphere. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">She had dropped out of battle to receive another Full Buff. &#xA0;After speaking that short sentence, she gritted her teeth like a boxer clamping down on her mouthguard.</span></p><p><span style="">She was expressing her intent of only focusing on the battle.</span></p><p><span style="">[The effect of the &#x2018;Candy from the Bloodsucker Tree&apos;s Sap&apos; was activated.] </span></p><p><span style="">She immediately started her fight again. &#xA0;Hatch&apos;s betrayal or the intrusion by the two guilds didn&apos;t register in her head. </span></p><p><span style="">It was the same for the Immoral Prince. These events were happening within the barrier it had raised to hide its body, yet it didn&#x2019;t lose its calm. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">When Shir once again charged forward, the Immoral Prince didn&apos;t show any particular signs. &#xA0;It lightly opened its hand, and a stream of fire rose up into the air. &#xA0;The stream of fire transformed into a large bird, and it flew towards Shir.</span></p><p><span style="">The attack was endlessly flashy and powerful, but it was merely a normal attack for the Immoral Prince.</span></p><p><span style="">Ggee-ah-ah! </span></p><p><span style="">The Fire Bird let out a cry as it swallowed up Shir. &#xA0;Armor was useless in front of the Fire Bird. &#xA0;The Fire Bird wormed its way into the gaps in Shir&apos;s armor, and her skin was being charred. &#xA0;Her HP was being ruthlessly chipped away. This was only a game, yet her body suddenly heated up as if she was in a sauna.</span></p><p><span style="">It was evidence that she had taken a massive amount of damage.</span></p><p><span style="">However, her HP started to recover immediately. &#xA0;It was thanks to the &apos;Candy from the Bloodsucker Tree&apos;s Sap&apos;.</span></p><p><span style="">Of course, the Fire Bird didn&apos;t slow down Shir&apos;s charge in the least.</span></p><p><span style="">In a flash, Shir had closed the distance with the Immoral Prince, and flame was still encircling her sword from the Fire Bird&apos;s attack.</span></p><p><span style="">The Immoral Prince had no thoughts of dodging Shir&apos;s attack. The Immoral prince also lightly swung its sword. A red aura was being retained by the sword swung by the Immoral Prince.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Shit!&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">Shir stopped everything in fright, and she forcefully twisted her body to the side. &#xA0;At the same time, the sword swung by the Immoral Prince split the air.</span></p><p><span style="">Soo-ooht! </span></p><p><span style="">The sound was very reedy. &#xA0;The sound was too light. &#xA0;It gave off the impression as if the sword hadn&#x2019;t been swung.</span></p><p><span style="">However, accompanying this light sound, a large sword scar appeared on top of the ground and in between the vegetation.</span></p><p><span style="">It was as if the world had been cut in half.</span></p><p><span style="">Shir rolled on the ground after she forcefully avoided the attack. &#xA0;The Immoral Prince turned its back on Shir.</span></p><p><span style="">It seemed the Immoral prince was going to destroy the new groups that was destroying its relic. &#xA0;It was about to move in to destroy them.</span></p><p><span style="">When she was ignored, Shir gritted her teeth.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;You should focus on the battle with me.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">She spoke through her gritted teeth. &#xA0;She didn&apos;t sound resolute. &#xA0;Her voice was more of a mixture of restlessness and a bit of gloominess. &#xA0;She worked hard to ignore her feelings, and she ran in towards the Immoral Prince. &#xA0;At that moment, she couldn&#x2019;t pay attention to what was going on in her surrounding.</span></p><p><span style="">Of course, she had no idea.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;&#x2026;&#x2026;isn&apos;t this the stronger version of the Crescent Moon Cut named Red Moon Sword Qi? &#xA0;If I had been hit by that&#x2026;&#x2026; I would have died in a really preposterous manner.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">She had no idea that the person she wanted to possess the most was nearby in the battlefield. &#xA0;She had no idea Hyrkan was there.</span></p><p>7.</p><p><span style="">Red Moon Sword Qi.</span></p><p><span style="">This skill would probably make the Swordsman Class Users&apos; blood boil in couple months time. &#xA0;This fearsome skill had made a deep scar on the ground next to him. &#xA0;Hyrkan was doing his best to shrink his body next to this scar. &#xA0;He carefully used the hologram monitor to check the live broadcasts of the 3 guilds.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;What a shit show.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">A mocking smile rested on Hyrkan&apos;s lips. &#xA0;No one knew Hyrkan was here right now. &#xA0;The Red Bulls had a contract with Hyrkan, but they thought he was resting after he finished leveling up. </span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;I knew this would happen.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">This was the reason why Hyrkan deceived the Red Bulls.</span></p><p><span style="">There was two reasons behind his deceit.</span></p><p><span style="">First, his contract didn&apos;t forbid him from doing this. &#xA0;Hyrkan didn&apos;t have to follow Red Bulls&apos; Raid plan. &#xA0;It was actually the opposite. &#xA0;If the Red Bulls wanted to broadcast footage of Hyrkan, they would have to work around Hyrkan&apos;s schedule.</span></p><p><span style="">The second reason was the fact that he had predicted this would happen.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Well, it doesn&apos;t matter if it&apos;s the cow bastards or the snake bastards. &#xA0;They all act the same.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">It was a cold situation where the two guilds were trying to take away the meaty part of the reward, while the Stormhunters was used as bait. &#xA0;It hadn&apos;t been too hard to predict what they were going to do. &#xA0;It was said like attracts like. &#xA0;These bastards thought alike, so it wasn&apos;t too hard to discern their intent.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;As expected, I don&apos;t like these kinds of people.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">At that moment, Hyrkan turned his head once again to look at Shir, who was earnestly fighting the Immoral Prince. &#xA0;He looked at the guild members of the Stormhunters looking intently at Shir&apos;s battle. &#xA0;They were so focused on the battle that there was no chance they would notice Hyrkan&apos;s existence.</span></p><p><span style="">The tail end of Hyrkan&apos;s lips rose as if it had been hooked by a fishing hook.</span></p><p><span style="">It was a situation where the Stormhunters had become the bait. &#xA0;In some ways, this improved Hyrkan&apos;s mood. &#xA0;It felt as if his hurting inside improved in the span of a morning.</span></p><p><span style="">On the other hand, he shouldn&#x2019;t be smiling. &#xA0;The current situation wasn&#x2019;t that great.</span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan returned the corner of his mouth to its original position. Then he tried to reason with himself.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;First, I have to put aside the feelings I have towards the Stormhunters. &#xA0;Let me think after I put away those feelings.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">Their current situation wasn&#x2019;t that great.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;If the Storm Queen dies here, it doesn&#x2019;t matter how many Users are left in the Stormhunters guild. &#xA0;They&#x2019;ll be uncooperative no matter what.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">The Stormhunters were the first to cause a problem, but the Red Bulls and Hydra guild responded with similar type of behaviors as the Stormhunters. &#xA0;During all of this, if Shir suffered a Game Over, the Stormhunters would never cooperate with the other two guilds.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;We&#x2019;ll be fortunate if they don&#x2019;t interfere with the Raid.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">If the worst situation comes to pass, the remaining Stormhunters guild members might attack the other two guilds. &#xA0;They would interfere with the Immoral Prince Raid.</span></p><p><span style="">Even if that doesn&#x2019;t come to pass, the Stormhunters might abstain from the battlefield. &#xA0;In the end, the Red Bulls, Hydra, and the Hahoe Mask would have to face the Immoral Prince.</span></p><p><span style="">Of course, they could do it.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;However, if the Stormhunters drop out, I might be in the same position as Che-sulyun.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">If the two guilds cooperate with each other, it was unknown as to whether Hyrkan would be able to hold the floor with them. &#xA0;That was the problem. </span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;If I don&#x2019;t want to die, I have to fight with my life on the line.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">There was no way the two guilds knew about Hyrkan&#x2019;s situation.</span></p><p><span style="">However, they could, at the very least, predict that Hyrkan would fight desperately against the Immoral Prince. &#xA0;It was a given that Hyrkan wouldn&#x2019;t just standby and do nothing in the Immoral Prince hunt. &#xA0;The price of failing to kill the Immoral Prince was annihilation. &#xA0;Moreover, from Hyrkan&#x2019;s perspective, Hyrkan needed to have the biggest role in the Immoral Prince series.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Anyways, I never expected Che-sulyun to fight so well. &#xA0;If I work with the Stormhunters, the chance of victory is over 90%.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">Moreover, it wouldn&#x2019;t be easy to kill the Immoral Prince if the Stormhunters pull themselves out of this Raid.</span></p><p><span style="">While the Stormhunters stood back from the Immoral Prince Raid, there was a good chance that multiple groups might turn against him. &#xA0;There was a high probability of the two guilds wouldn&#x2019;t help out, while Hyrkan faced impossible odds.</span></p><p><span style="">In the worst case scenario, the Hahoe Mask would buy them as much time as they needed against the Immoral Prince to complete their tasks. &#xA0;Afterwards, the Red Bulls and Hydra guild could join hands, and they would be the only ones that would get a happy ending. </span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Anyways, I can&apos;t trust those two guilds &#xA0;no matter what.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">If Hyrkan was asked to name the guild he hated the most in the 30 great guilds, he would say it was the Stormhunters. &#xA0;However, this didn&apos;t mean he had inexhaustible amount of faith in the other 29 guilds.</span></p><p><span style="">This was also true for the Red Bulls. &#xA0;He had decided to work with them, but he didn&apos;t trust them. &#xA0;They were all doing this for profit. &#xA0;In other words, if Hyrkan aimed for their share in the profit and he caused a loss for the Red Bulls, their attitude and stance towards him would change.</span></p><p><span style="">So what was the best case scenario?</span></p><p><span style="">It would be for best if the 3 guilds were all wiped out, and Hyrkan was the last man standing. &#xA0;This wasn&#x2019;t a guarantee. &#xA0;It was only a guess, but if the Hahoe Mask could monopolize all the rewards given in the Immoral Prince series, he wouldn&#x2019;t have to worry about Items anymore.</span></p><p><span style="">However, this scenario was unrealistic. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">As always, the best case scenario rarely came to fruition. &#xA0;This was why a person should act in a way where they could avoid the worst case scenario. &#xA0;One had to do this instead of working towards the best case scenario.</span></p><p><span style="">In his current situation, the second best policy was to choose the path with the highest probability of killing the Immoral Prince.</span></p><p><span style="">This was beyond considering the risks and returns. &#xA0;He must catch the Immoral Prince, and he had to choose the method where his survival was guaranteed.</span></p><p><span style="">To accomplish this, Shir had to survive, and the performance of the Stormhunters was critical.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hoo-ooh.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan regulated his breathing.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;My life is really fucked up.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">A lot of thoughts passed through his mind. &#xA0;There were a lot of regrets in his past experiences, but at the same time, those experiences had nothing to do with his current situation. &#xA0;The memories of those times no longer existed now, and these thoughts flitted through his head.</span></p><p><span style="">The thought of his past experiences made this choice very hard hard to swallow. &#xA0;In the end, Hyrkan had to convince his pride more so than anything else.</span></p><p><span style="">He wasn&#x2019;t helping the Stormhunters and Che-sulyun. &#xA0;This was a necessary task he had to accomplish if he wanted to step over everyone&#x2026; &#xA0;It wasn&#x2019;t a brief amount of time, but he was finally able to convince his pride with regards to his course of action.</span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan pulled himself together as he got up.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;This is for me.&#x2019;</span></p><p>8.</p><p><span style="">If one kept sprinting in consecutive races, one&apos;s record would get worse instead of getting better.</span></p><p><span style="">Battle was similar in that aspect.</span></p><p><span style="">Shir was able to last 5 minutes in her first battle with the Immoral Prince. &#xA0;However, she was only able to buy 4 minutes on her second try. &#xA0;On the third attempt, she had started the fight when she hadn&#x2019;t been able to pull her emotions back together.</span></p><p><span style="">This was why she started to rapidly waver after 3 minutes into her 3rd battle. &#xA0;Eventually, an accident happened. </span></p><p><span style="">The Immoral Prince&#x2019;s sword was dyed red, but Shir didn&#x2019;t stop her charge as the Immoral Prince used the Red Crescent Moon skill. &#xA0;She changed her steps to lean herself diagonally, and she was barely able to dodge the Red Crescent Moon.</span></p><p><span style="">She used the Dash skill at the same time as she dodged the attack.</span></p><p><span style="">In a flash, she closed a distance of about 15 meters. &#xA0;As she closed the distance, she used her Booster skill.</span></p><p><span style="">She even used the Crescent Moon Cut skill. &#xA0;This meant there was no way she would be able to evade backwards.</span></p><p><span style="">She didn&#x2019;t care about the damage. &#xA0;When her attack reached it, the Immoral Prince would start the battle with her again. &#xA0;This was what Shir was aiming for.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;If it dodges backward, I&#x2019;ll use Body Slam to initiate a close combat&#x2026;.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">Of course, inside Shir&#x2019;s head, the next move, the next move and the next next move was formulated. &#xA0;She was thinking three moves ahead. &#xA0;If she was incapable of thinking ahead, her head would be useless.</span></p><p><span style="">The problem was her decrease in stamina. &#xA0;Her judgement was becoming dulled.</span></p><p><span style="">Shir was trying to think about her next move, so she wasn&#x2019;t able to counterattack or even dodge the Immoral Prince&#x2019;s attack. &#xA0;She also missed the fact that the Immoral Prince had used a much faster version of the Dash skill she had used. &#xA0;She wasn&#x2019;t able to immediately recognize this fact.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Ah!&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">When Shir became aware of this fact, the Immoral Prince&#x2019;s sword was already touching Shir&#x2019;s shoulder.</span></p><p><span style="">Kwah-jeek! </span></p><p><span style="">The sword sliced through her black armor and her left shoulder.</span></p><p><span style="">Koohng! </span></p><p><span style="">At the same time, the Immoral Prince followed up with a Body Slam. &#xA0;Shir had lost her arm, and her body was in a baad state as she rolled across the floor.</span></p><p><span style="">The first one to move in this situation was Hahui.</span></p><p><span style="">Usually, she would charge in while yelling &#x2018;My Queen!&#x2019;, but she silently charged forward.</span></p><p><span style="">She wasn&#x2019;t in a Full Buff state, and she hadn&#x2019;t even used her own Buffs on herself. &#xA0;The speed at which Hahui was charging forward was the worst move one could pull against the Immoral Prince.</span></p><p><span style="">Hwee-reek! </span></p><p><span style="">The Immoral Prince stepped aside as if it was evading a charging bull. &#xA0;It easily evaded Hahui&#x2019;s Body Slam. &#xA0;As if it had been waiting for Hahui, the sword flew in parallel to the floor like rock skipping over water. &#xA0;It was swift.</span></p><p><span style="">Soo-oohk! </span></p><p><span style="">The sword cut through her left thigh.</span></p><p><span style="">Hahui had lost a leg, so she fell over to the floor. &#xA0;The sword that had been swung by the Immoral Prince was reversed in an instant. &#xA0;It planned on pinning its sword through Hahui&#x2019;s head.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Ah!&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">It had all happened in such a brief amount of time, so no one was able to react to the critical situation. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">Aside from reacting to it, no one had been able to process what was going on. &#xA0;That was the reality of the situation.</span></p><p><span style="">In the end, the guild members hadn&#x2019;t moved. &#xA0;A third party had stepped in.</span></p><p><span style="">Kwah-ahng! </span></p><p><span style="">Accompanying a sudden sound of an explosion, a third party had appeared out of nowhere as he swung his sword towards the Immoral Prince.</span></p><p><span style="">Kah-ahng! </span></p><p><span style="">Instead of exchanging a greeting with the Immoral Prince, he shared the sound of steel with it.</span></p><p><span style="">It was the Hahoe Mask.</span></p>
