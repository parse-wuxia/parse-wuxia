<p><span style="">Chapter 165 &#x2013; Trace of Bokan (1)</span></p><p>1.</p><p><span style="">Koo-oohng! </span></p><p><span style="">The Frost Golem Snake, which boasted an enormous body length of 8 meters, appeared. &#xA0;The monsters had been stumbling backwards, but now they quickly turned their gazes towards the Golem in fright.</span></p><p><span style="">The shaggy Orangutans weren&apos;t small. &#xA0;They were 2 meters tall, and every one of them had crude instruments for weapons. &#xA0;Moreover, they wore a very crude wooden mask. &#xA0;This was why one couldn&apos;t see their expressions, but their actions clearly showed what emotion they were feeling.</span></p><p><span style="">Confusion. </span></p><p><span style="">Ooh-ggi-ggi! &#xA0;Ggi-ggi! </span></p><p><span style="">It was as if they weren&apos;t satisfied with expressing their confusion with their actions. &#xA0;The 10 masked monsters let out a sharp cry. &#xA0;Their cries intermingled with each other to make a very unpleasant sound.</span></p><p><span style="">As if angered by this sound, the Frost Golem Snake opened its mouth wide towards the source of the sounds. &#xA0;White Frost exited from the Frost Golem Snake&apos;s mouth, and it brushed past the monsters. &#xA0;The cold terror made the Masked Monster Orangutans shake in fear.</span></p><p><span style="">However, the Frost Golem weren&#x2019;t the ones to defeat the source of the noises. &#xA0;It was the Skeleton Knights and the Skeleton Warriors. &#xA0;The monsters were blocked off by the Frost Golem Snake, so they really were like mices trapped in a jar. &#xA0;The Skeleton Knights and Warriors ruthlessly cut down the monsters as Frost swirled around them.</span></p><p><span style="">Kah-ahng! </span></p><p><span style="">In the beginning, it sounded like steel clashing on steel. </span></p><p><span style="">Poohk! </span></p><p><span style="">However, it quickly turned into the sound of swords cutting through flesh. &#xA0;Winter arrived in the green forest, which was occupied by the Masked Monster Orangutans.</span></p><p><span style="">Suddenly, flame erupted from one side.</span></p><p><span style="">Hwah-roo-roo! </span></p><p><span style="">It was a Griffin. &#xA0;It had the body of a lion. &#xA0;It also possessed the head and wings of an eagle. &#xA0;The Fire Golem had changed into the Griffin, and it flapped its wing to fly in the air. &#xA0;It let out an enormous flame from its mouth as the forest was turned into a sea of flame.</span></p><p><span style="">Ggi-ee! &#xA0;Ggi-ee! </span></p><p><span style="">While the forest was burning up, the masked monsters shot spears and arrows toward the Griffin Fire Golem flying above their heads. &#xA0;The arrows and spears left clear wounds on the Golem&apos;s body, but fire quickly filled in the wounds.</span></p><p><span style="">The anger expressed by the monsters were egregiously futile.</span></p><p><span style="">While the monsters were focused on the Griffin Fire Golem, the Mini Ogre Skeleton Warriors quickly infiltrated the burning forest. &#xA0;They were small, but in certain aspects, they were as scary as the Skeleton Knights. The burning forest completely erased their presence.</span></p><p><span style="">They moved towards the Masked Monster Orangutans like assassins, and the Mini Ogre Skeleton Warriors targeted the lower half of the monsters.</span></p><p><span style="">Thighs were stabbed. &#xA0;Their knees were cut and their calves were severed.</span></p><p><span style="">When their legs were attacked, the Masked Monster Orangutans fell in place. &#xA0;Two or three Mini Ogre equipped with level 190 Unique weapons fell on the monsters. &#xA0;These weapons were too expensive for most normal Users to purchase. &#xA0;These weapons started hacking the fallen monsters into pieces.</span></p><p><span style="">Ggi-ee! Ggi-ee! </span></p><p><span style="">The sharp cries that had filled the forest was disappearing one by one.</span></p><p><span style="">However, in this battle, the largest curse wasn&apos;t the winter or the flames. &#xA0;It was the black fog that was filling this stage.</span></p><p><span style="">[The King Orangutan fell into lethargy.] </span></p><p><span style="">This monster was the king of the Masked Monster Orangutans. &#xA0;The King Orangutan was a level 240 middle boss.</span></p><p><span style="">In truth, no Users had any informations regarding this monster. &#xA0;This was the only stage where the King Orangutan appeared. &#xA0;Moreover, it had been only four days since this Orangutan&apos;s Forest was found by a User.</span></p><p><span style="">When it became cursed, it started to pound its chest with its two hands like a gorilla.</span></p><p><span style="">[The King Orangutan&apos;s Shout has chased the Curse away.] </span></p><p><span style="">It had nullified all Debuff type Skills, and this was also the first time this setting was revealed.</span></p><p><span style="">After gaining confidence, the monster unfurled its crouched body. &#xA0;It was also the first time anyone saw the 6 meter tall monster stand at full height.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Ok.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">Everything he was seeing now was new. &#xA0;However, Hyrkan wasn&apos;t flustered.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;I think I have a rough idea on what is going on.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">It seemed he had figured out something. &#xA0;Hyrkan immediately gave the command for an attack to the waiting Death Knight. &#xA0;It was as if the Death Knight had been eagerly waiting for the signal. &#xA0;The Skeleton Steed let out its joy as it charged towards the King Orangutan.</span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan was watching from 300 meters away, and he grabbed a Bone Spear. &#xA0;As he grabbed the Bone Spear, he immediately put a recovery Item within his mouth. &#xA0;It was very sour, and his tongue tingled. &#xA0;It was like the candy one ate on a dare. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan furrowed his brow.</span></p><p><span style="">It was sour, but the effect was indisputable. &#xA0;His magical energy quickly climbed, and Hyrkan used the magical power to imbue a Curse on the Bone Spear.</span></p><p><span style="">On top of everything, this Bone Spear wasn&apos;t made out a common Bone Ingredient. &#xA0;It was a Bone Spear made using a level 190 Boss Monster as ingredient. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">It was incredibly powerful, and it was expensive.</span></p><p><span style="">He was burning money.</span></p><p><span style="">There was no other way to describe what he was doing, but he didn&apos;t worry about the monetary part of the game.</span></p><p><span style="">He didn&apos;t let it linger in his mind.</span></p><p><span style="">He only focused on the battle.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;There is no cool time to the Dispel skill, and it can be used in an unlimited fashion. &#xA0;However, it has to pound its chest every time it wants to use the Skill.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">King Orangutan.</span></p><p><span style="">As mentioned before, this monster had never been revealed to the world yet. &#xA0;Hyrkan was the first to discover this monster.</span></p><p><span style="">Even if Hyrkan combined his current experience with his past memories, he had never seen this monster in Warlord.</span></p><p><span style="">This was a natural course of events. &#xA0;From now on, Hyrkan would experience things he had never experienced before.</span></p><p><span style="">However, Hyrkan wasn&apos;t flustered by it. &#xA0;There was no reason to be flustered.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;I just have to stop it from pounding its chest.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan had experienced too much to be taken aback by anything.</span></p><p><span style="">He proved that his determined attitude wasn&apos;t a bluff when the Death Knight and the King Orangutan started to fight. &#xA0;Hyrkan took the situation into his own hands.</span></p><p><span style="">The battlefield was loud. &#xA0;It was like trying to make a phone call in a very noisy rock concert. &#xA0;It was an annoying environment, yet Hyrkan&apos;s concentration allowed him to hit the bullseye. &#xA0;It hadn&apos;t been a short distance. &#xA0;Hyrkan&apos;s spear flew 300 meters before it was embedded in the King Orangutan&apos;s body.</span></p><p><span style="">[King Orangutan was hit with the Sloth Curse.] </span></p><p><span style="">[Curse Infection was activated on the King Orangutan. &#xA0;The curse has spread to the surrounding.] </span></p><p><span style="">As predicted, the King Orangutan couldn&apos;t dispel the curse. &#xA0;The Death Knight didn&apos;t give it time to pound its chest.</span></p><p><span style="">At that moment...</span></p><p><span style="">[Your Level has increased.] </span></p><p><span style="">The Level Announcement that notified Hyrkan reaching a higher level of 220 was heard.</span></p><p>2.</p><p><span style="">[Hyrkan] </span></p><p><span style="">- Level : 220</span></p><p><span style="">- Class : Lich </span></p><p><span style="">- Title : 227 </span></p><p><span style="">- Stats : Strength(2855)/Stamina(1855)/Intelligence(1952)/Magic Power(2222) </span></p><p><span style="">&#x2013; In possession of the Ancient Power of &#x2018;Frost&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ah.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Level 220. </span></p><p><span style="">Even he thought his Level Up pace was ridiculous, yet Hyrkan had an unsatisfied expression on his face. There was an expression filled with worry behind the Hahoe Mask. &#xA0;He wasn&apos;t worried about his Levels, Stats, Item setting and the current hunting speed. &#xA0;There was no way these issues would worry him. &#xA0;Instead, he was thrilled about those aspects of the game. &#xA0;Before he had returned to the past, he had dreamed about hunting this way.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Do I really have to go back?&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">If looked in a certain way, his progress was the root of his worry.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Ah. &#xA0;This is driving me crazy.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">He was doing too well.</span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan wanted to maintain his Level Up pace. &#xA0;Most Users dreamed about hunting like him. &#xA0;He had the best Item setting, and he didn&apos;t need to hold back in using recovery Items. &#xA0;Moreover, he didn&apos;t have to worry about gathering crap items, since he was financially well off. &#xA0;He was basically monopolizing a hunting ground, and his Level Up pace matched what he experienced when his level was in double figures.</span></p><p><span style="">If he hated this, he shouldn&apos;t be playing this game.</span></p><p><span style="">However, he had reached a point where he had to clean up the loose threads. &#xA0;He was already level 220. &#xA0;After passing the level 200 mark, he had never visited the Class Tower yet.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;I have to receive the Quests, and I have to learn new Skills.... &#xA0;At the very least, I have to visit the Class Tower....&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">The problem was the fact that he had to cross over the Urugal mountain range to consolidate these loose ends.</span></p><p><span style="">Currently, the only rest place in the Black Continent was the town near the Heard Fortress ruin. &#xA0;The Heard Fortress town was getting bigger by the day, but it would take a long time for a Class Tower to be erected.</span></p><p><span style="">He had already anticipated the problem. &#xA0;In the past, the most annoying part of operating in the Black Continent was the travel. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">This was why he had refused to go back at level 210. &#xA0;He promised himself that he would go to the Class Tower when he was level 220.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Still, the [Steel Golem] will surely be of help to me. &#xA0;I&apos;ve also gained enough Skill Rank to acquire [Curse Shower].&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">It was time for him to make good on his promise. &#xA0;If he kept pushing back a promise he had made to himself, he might die later on, because he lacked certain Skills. &#xA0;It would be better for him to go than regretting his inaction in death.</span></p><p><span style="">Moreover, there was no actual downside in going to the Class Tower for Hyrkan. &#xA0;Instead, he would gain a lot by going there.</span></p><p><span style="">There was only upsides to obtaining the [Steel Golem] Skill. &#xA0;There was no way he would suffer a loss.</span></p><p><span style="">The Skill allowed him to summon an Iron Golem, and its usefulness was beyond description. &#xA0;Its best attribute was defense. &#xA0;Its defense couldn&apos;t be compared to the defense of the Earth Golem and the Frost Golem. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">If he used the Clay Play skill to borrow the Spec of a monster with great defense, he could use Hardening to create a massive shield.</span></p><p><span style="">Then there was the romantic in him, who wanted to obtain it.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;I want to mount Skeleton Magicians on the Iron Golem like Rich Lich....&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">Rich Lich had used a combination of the Iron Golem and the Skeleton Magicians. &#xA0;The Iron Golem was like a moving castle wall, and it defended the Skeleton Magicians. &#xA0;The Skeleton Magicians let out a continuous barrage of magic behind this protection.</span></p><p><span style="">On top of it all, the fact that he would have 3 Golems was incredible in itself.</span></p><p><span style="">He&apos;ll be able to defend attacks from three sides.</span></p><p><span style="">Currently, the Golem were mainly used in two ways. &#xA0;The Earth Golem was used to block the road, and the Fire Golem was used to gather the monsters.</span></p><p><span style="">Since most monsters couldn&apos;t outnumber him anymore, Hyrkan was able to use this method. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">This method was even effective against the Boss Monsters.</span></p><p><span style="">In such a situation, what would happen if the Iron Golem appeared to close the third side?</span></p><p><span style="">It would create a stage. &#xA0;It was a perfect stage where the Death Knight could go nuts! </span></p><p><span style="">Moreover, the [Curse Shower] was a very good skill. &#xA0;The Skill allowed a shower to fall, which could give Curse Effect to his enemies. &#xA0;It was an AOE Curse Skill. &#xA0;Recently, his Curse Skill proficiency reached a point where he would be able to learn this skill.</span></p><p><span style="">If he gained these Skills, he would basically achieve another Spec Up.</span></p><p><span style="">Moreover, the enemies he had to fight weren&apos;t merely monsters.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;There&apos;s the Five Star bastards. &#xA0;Moreover, the Stormhunters have gone through a significant Spec Up.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">The Five Stars and the Stormhunters were also operating out of the Black Continent. &#xA0;They weren&apos;t as fast as Hyrkan, but they were quickly increasing their Specs. &#xA0;They were quickly handing out Unique and Rare Rank level 200 Items to their members. </span></p><p><span style="">On the other hand, Hyrkan&apos;s Item setting had remained the same. &#xA0;He couldn&apos;t Spec Up. &#xA0;There were no Items better than the ones he was wearing right now. &#xA0;This was the price of being one of the leaders in this race.</span></p><p><span style="">In such a situation, there was no better way to Spec Up than to learn a free Skill from the Class Tower.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Recently, the traffic around the Voodook&apos;s tunnel has lessened, but.... &#xA0;If it comes to it, I could join a party as a third wheel.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">The current situation at the Voodook&apos;s Tunnel was added to his list of worries.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;I have no choice.&#x2019;</span></p><p>3.</p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Maybe I should have crossed over by dying? &#xA0;It took me 2 days to get here, and it&apos;ll take me two days to... &#xA0;Shit. &#xA0;If I could fly over the Urugal mountain range using the Wyvern Golem, I could do a round trip in one day. &#xA0;I have a mount I could ride, but the game mechanic won&apos;t allow me to fly it. &#xA0;Fuck this game.&#x2019; &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">After obtaining his Skills from the Class Tower, he quickly moved his feet as he looked at the Skill descriptions.</span></p><p><span style="">Every second felt wasteful to him. &#xA0;Hyrkan didn&apos;t bother hiding his identity as he descended the Class Tower. When he exited, there was a significant amount of attention directed towards him, but he was indifferent to it. &#xA0;Even if a User came up to him to ask for a screenshot, he planned on tripping the User and running away.</span></p><p><span style="">However, the one to stop his hurried steps wasn&apos;t a User. &#xA0;It was a NPC.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I have a letter for the disciple of Ahimbree-nim. &#xA0;It is addressed to Hyrkan-nim.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">He had received a letter.</span></p><p><span style="">If the NPC had said it was just a letter, it wouldn&apos;t have been able to stop Hyrkan&#x2019;s steps. The problem was the person, who had sent it.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Ahimbree?&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">Aside from the nickname of Rich Lich attributed to Hyrkan by the Users, he had a lot of Titles within this game. &#xA0;Arbiter of Corruption, Hero of the Hiban Kingdom.... &#xA0;If this was really a fantasy world, he would have a hard time hearing his name mentioned, because he had too many titles.</span></p><p><span style="">The title mentioned right now was Disciple of Ahimbree. &#xA0;It was a Title he had earned a long time ago, and it had almost faded into his memories. &#xA0;Hyrkan tilted his head in confusion, then he became delighted by the news.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;I&apos;m sure Ahimbree gave Skill Book Quests after lvl 200. &#xA0;Could it be?&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">This morsel was delicious enough to stop him in his tracks.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Who sent me this letter?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan immediately became courteous, and he treated the NPC with more respect.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;It is from Ahimbree-nim. &#xA0;He personally left it here. &#xA0;He left instructions for me to deliver it when I see his disciples.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan smiled.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;I keep hitting the jackpot.&#x2019;</span></p><p>4.</p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Did you hear the news?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Sohank shrugged his shoulders at Natal&apos;s question.</span></p><p><span style="">It was a gesture that said, &apos;What the hell are you talking about?&apos;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I&apos;m talking about our take over.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ah. &#xA0;You mean the Fighters guild?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Sohank continued to speak as if the news wasn&apos;t noteworthy.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;It&apos;s a good move. &#xA0;They have a lot of User good at fighting. &#xA0;Ah. &#xA0;I&apos;m not saying our guys aren&apos;t good at fighting....&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I understand why we are taking over the Fighters guild. &#xA0;Still, I don&apos;t get the reason why we have to be in such a rush. &#xA0;The First Head usually never fails to give us a heads up, and he almost never rushes any business dealings....&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Sohank patted Natal&apos;s worried shoulders.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;At the very least, he isn&apos;t messing up the deals. &#xA0;Don&apos;t worry too much about it. &#xA0;Above all, we have another opportunity thanks to the First Head. &#xA0;As he had said before, we would have never gotten this opportunity if we hadn&apos;t gambled everything in coming west.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">When he mentioned the opportunity, Natal nodded his head. &#xA0;However, his expression refused to relax.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;In truth, we had to do something if we want to go up against them.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">At Sohank&apos;s words, the two of them turned towards the large mountain range in the distance.</span></p><p><span style="">It happened at that moment.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Sohank-nim! &#xA0;Let&apos;s fight once more!&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">A carefree voice was heard coming from somewhere. &#xA0;When the source of the voice was located, one could see a User with his sword out. &#xA0;It was as if the User had readied himself for a battle. &#xA0;The two Users, who had been looking at the mountain range, looked at each other when they saw the new User.</span></p><p><span style="">Natal looked at this User with a very annoyed expression on his face.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Kiyote!&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ah. &#xA0;It seems Natal-nim is here too. &#xA0;How are you doing?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Why do you keep making trouble for me.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Kiyote. </span></p><p><span style="">He was a User, who had become incredibly famous through PVP. &#xA0;The love calls from the 30 great guilds had been sent his way for a long time. &#xA0;It was difficult to hit the jackpot through PVP, but at the very least, you could get one&#x2019;s basic needs through this content. </span></p><p><span style="">This was why everyone was surprised when they heard Kiyote had entered the Hydra guild.</span></p><p><span style="">First, Kiyote had ignored significant amount of contract fee in the past. &#xA0;He wasn&apos;t interested in money, and he hadn&apos;t been interested in the Hydra guild, since they didn&apos;t really deal with PVP contents. &#xA0;There was no common ground between the two parties.</span></p><p><span style="">This was why everyone was curious. &#xA0;Why did Kiyote enter into the Hydra guild? &#xA0;What did the Hydra guild use to entice this User?</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I made it clear when I entered the Hydra guild. &#xA0;I&apos;m allowed to challenge anyone at any time for a PVP match unless there is an unavoidable engagement.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">This was the reason why he had joined.</span></p><p><span style="">The Hydra guild had drawn the line at not killing each other, but the Hydra guild agreed to let Kiyote challenge anyone to a PVP match if the situation allowed it. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">There was no stronger Users than the ones in the 30 great guilds. &#xA0;This guild was filled with skilled Users.</span></p><p><span style="">His reputation took a bit of a hit when he was killed by the Killer Sinclair, but Sohank was still one of the top Strikers in Warlord.</span></p><p><span style="">From Kiyote&apos;s point of view, this was the most enticing reason that made him join this guild. </span></p><p><span style="">It was rare to be able to do PVP match with a skilled User, who represented one of the 30 great guilds.</span></p><p><span style="">In truth, Natal put up the most ferocious opposition to this deal. &#xA0;Natal had expressed his discontent regarding the deal when the Nine Heads had a meeting. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">Sohank was their most important fighting power, and he didn&apos;t want Sohank to waste his time and effort in humoring Kiyote. &#xA0;Natal wouldn&apos;t stand for it.</span></p><p><span style="">However, in the end, the Hydra guild accepted Kiyote into their folds. &#xA0;It was passed through a vote of majority as 8 Heads agreed with the decision. &#xA0;When it was such a decisive vote, Natal had no choice, but to accept it.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;A deal is a deal.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Unlike Natal, Sohank welcomed the addition of Kiyote.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What conditions?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Let&apos;s fight with no Skills. &#xA0;You possess the power of Darkness, so how could I win against you in terms of Skills?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What about Items?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;We&apos;ll go with what we have on right now. &#xA0;A handicap of that level would spice up this fight.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Sohank let out a smile. &#xA0;He actually welcomed Kiyote&apos;s challenges. &#xA0;He was satisfied with Kiyote&apos;s presence.</span></p><p><span style="">Natal shook his head from side to side as he looked at Sohank. &#xA0;The one, who welcomed Kiyote the most, was none other than Sohank. &#xA0;Sohank was called the most important fighting power amongst the 9 Heads, but it was probably hard being the only skilled User of his level in the guild.</span></p><p><span style="">In such a situation, it was imperative for them to add Users that didn&apos;t fall below their expectations.</span></p><p><span style="">This made Natal think about another User.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;If we are taking over the Fighters guild.... &#xA0;Will Whistling Pitbull be added to our ranks?&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">Even the Fighters guild had a hard time dealing with the Whistling Pitbull. &#xA0;It boggled Natal&apos;s mind that it would be his job to handle the Whistling Pitbull now.</span></p>
