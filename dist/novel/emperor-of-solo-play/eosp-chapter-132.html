<p>Chapter 132 - On the Eve (3)</p><p>6.</p><p><span style="">[You level has increased.] </span></p><p><span style="">When he succeeded in leveling up, Hyrkan reached into the small pouch hanging from his waist. &#xA0;He took out 5 Skeleton Fragments, and he threw it over his back. &#xA0;The Skeleton Fragments rolled across the floor like acorns, and they immediately changed into Skeleton Magicians wearing gray robes.</span></p><p><span style="">After the Skeleton Magicians formed, they gathered their hands. &#xA0;An emaciated flame started to form between their hands. &#xA0;The Skeleton Magicians moved their hands as if they were caressing it. As if to reward their attention, the fireballs started to expand. &#xA0;The fireballs, which had been the size of a child&apos;s fist, was suddenly the size of a man&apos;s head. &#xA0;At that moment, the Skeleton Magicians immediately threw their fireballs.</span></p><p><span style="">Hwah-roo-rooh! </span></p><p><span style="">The five fireballs flew in an arc. &#xA0;At the end of the arc, there was a battle going on.</span></p><p><span style="">Ggah-ahng, kah-ahng! </span></p><p><span style="">The sound of steel striking was endless. &#xA0;It was very easy to differentiate between the two groups that was fighting. &#xA0;The contrast was stark.</span></p><p><span style="">One side was composed of Skeleton Warriors with horns on their head. &#xA0;They were wearing an armor that was made out of black colored barks. &#xA0;On the other side, one could see adequately armored humanoid lizards that had black feathers coming off their hides. &#xA0;They were the Black Grooming Lizard Warriors </span></p><p><span style="">The battle between the Skeleton Warriors and the Grooming Lizards were fierce and closely contested. &#xA0;The two groups were so close to each other that a mumble could be heard by the other side.</span></p><p><span style="">Five enormous fireball fell into the battlefield. &#xA0;Of course, the fireballs didn&apos;t differentiate between enemies and allies.</span></p><p><span style="">Puh-uhng, puh-uhng.</span></p><p><span style="">The five consecutive sound of explosions swept across the battlefield. &#xA0;The black feathers of the Grooming Lizards started to burn, and the Skeleton Warriors started to let out black colored blood.</span></p><p><span style="">[Black Grooming Lizard Warriors were affected by the Black Sap.] </span></p><p><span style="">The Black Tree set&apos;s effect had been activated.</span></p><p><span style="">At the same time, the Skeleton Warriors immediately regained their original form. They regained their original imposing form, and one couldn&apos;t see any trace of magical damage on them.</span></p><p><span style="">On the other hand, the Grooming Lizard Warriors looked unseemly from the effects of the magical attack. &#xA0;Their feathers were burning, and the Black Sap clinging to them were quickly diminishing their HP.</span></p><p><span style="">Sha-ah! Shah-ah! </span></p><p><span style="">The bloody cry came out out of the Grooming Lizards&apos; mouth. &#xA0;It wasn&apos;t a threatening cry. &#xA0;It was most definitely a cry filled with pain. &#xA0;Even this didn&apos;t last long. &#xA0;A Skeleton Knight appeared with the Black Cobalt King&apos;s sword in front of it, and its presence shut the mouths of the Grooming Lizards. &#xA0;The Grooming Lizards were so tense that they didn&apos;t even attempt to quench the flame sticking to their hide.</span></p><p><span style="">The Skeleton Knight didn&apos;t let out any sound. &#xA0;It just opened its mouth wide, and it pointed its sword towards the Grooming Lizard Warriors once. &#xA0;It let out a silent roar as it charged. </span></p><p><span style="">The explosions caused by the magic had created a state of lull on the battlefield, but the Skeleton Knight once again turned the stage into a pandemonium.</span></p><p><span style="">At that moment, Hyrkan wasn&apos;t looking at this sight. &#xA0;Hyrkan&apos;s gaze was to the left. &#xA0;In the distance, there was a User observing at Hyrkan.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Where&apos;s the next location?&#x201D; &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">The User immediately answered Hyrkan&apos;s question.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;We&apos;ve already prepared it!&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">This was the Black Grooming Lizard&apos;s nest. &#xA0;This was the exclusive hunting ground of the Red Bulls guild.</span></p><p><span style="">Warlord had level up support teams.</span></p><p><span style="">It was a very absurd concept. &#xA0;However, the 30 great guilds, the Underfoot guilds and any large guilds possessed level up support teams. &#xA0;Even some individuals possessed a personal level up team. &#xA0;The First One Sulwoo, who was ranked number 1 in Warlord&apos;s Level Ranking, was a prime example.</span></p><p><span style="">Of course, the role of a level up support team was to help a User increase their level.</span></p><p><span style="">The basic procedure was for the team to give material support. &#xA0;In truth, most decent sized guilds participated in doing this. &#xA0;They designated a fixed region as their main hunting ground, and the guild provided Items to guild members as needed as they hunted. &#xA0;By extension, there were also Buff teams that casted only Buff and Healing magic. &#xA0;Then there were the Gathering teams that rounded up the monsters.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I knew he was a monster, but I never knew what kind of a monster he was.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Bower was the team leader of the Red Bulls guild&#x2019;s level up support team. He was basically the hidden trainer of the Red Bulls guild, and he was very experienced. &#xA0;At the same time, he was very close to Chev in real life.</span></p><p><span style="">He was a User affiliated with the Red Bulls, but he had realized he had no talent for this game early on. &#xA0;This was why he had helped out the Red Bulls with extrinsic matters, and this was how he was able to rise to his current position.</span></p><p><span style="">Currently, he was assisting &#xA0;the Hahoe Mask in leveling up.</span></p><p><span style="">- His hunting speed is amazing. &#xA0;It would take 5 minutes for a 3 man party to clear it, yet he is doing it in 3 minutes by himself. &#xA0;If we just talk in terms of efficiency, his hunting speed is about 5 times faster.</span></p><p><span style="">Of course, Bower wasn&apos;t the only one helping the Hahoe Mask.</span></p><p><span style="">The owner of the voice that had responded to Bower was named Ricky. &#xA0;He was a young 20 year old, who liked Warlord. &#xA0;It had only been two month, since they started to work together, so he was a beginner to all of this. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;He isn&apos;t really 5 times faster, but his speed seems to on par with the First One.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Ricky was a younger cousin of one of the Red Bulls guild&#x2019;s officers. His work on the Support team was a temporary job he was doing to make some money on the side. &#xA0;He was also a big fan of the First One.</span></p><p><span style="">- Is he really comparable to the First One?</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;In my opinion, he is faster than the First One.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">- What? &#xA0;No way.</span></p><p><span style="">This happened from time to time. &#xA0;Ricky had parachuted into the level up support team through his background, so he didn&apos;t hesitate to disagree with his superior. </span></p><p><span style="">- The First One powered through level 220 yesterday. &#xA0;He now has a 15 level difference between the top 100! &#xA0;In truth, if you compare him to the Hahoe Mask, it is an insult to the First One.</span></p><p><span style="">Bower couldn&apos;t help, but let out a bitter laugh at Ricky&apos;s response.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;If someone saw this, one would think he is my superior.&#x2019; &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">Of course, he didn&apos;t like Ricky&apos;s reaction.</span></p><p><span style="">On the other hand, he understood Ricky&apos;s reaction. If one looked at Ricky&apos;s word from a normal User&#x2019;s perspective, he wasn&apos;t wrong.</span></p><p><span style="">First One was a speed demon at leveling up. &#xA0;No, he was something more than that. &#xA0;The proof was in his ranking.</span></p><p><span style="">Every Ranker within the top 100 tried to level up as if it was a life and death task. &#xA0;A single level difference was like a difference of 1 second in a 100 meter sprint. It was a very big difference.</span></p><p><span style="">Yet the First One was steadily creating a distance between the level 100 Ranked User and him.</span></p><p><span style="">Of course, Bower knew about this.</span></p><p><span style="">Bower had led the Red Bulls&apos; level up support team from an early point in time. &#xA0;One of his duties was to find faster ways to level up, so he had researched the know hows of the Rankers. &#xA0;This was why Bower was much more knowledgeable about the First One than Ricky.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;All right. &#xA0;I spoke in error.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Of course, he wasn&apos;t going to argue with Ricky right now. &#xA0;He&apos;ll just secretly talk to Chev. &#xA0;He&apos;ll just tell Chev that Ricky is an asshole. &#xA0;Then Chev will handle the situation.</span></p><p><span style="">- The First One is the best.</span></p><p><span style="">Ricky had no idea about his fate, so he stubbornly restated his opinion. &#xA0;However, his tantrum didn&apos;t enter Bower&apos;s ears. &#xA0;Bower once again looked at the Hahoe Mask&apos;s battle footage.</span></p><p><span style="">In truth, he didn&apos;t need to assist the Hahoe Mask in leveling up. &#xA0;Bower wasn&apos;t just some simple trainer. &#xA0;He was like the the Daddy Long Legs of the primary raid team members in the Red Bulls guild. &#xA0;He had been supporting them since they were around level 20~30. &#xA0;Bower was like a big brother to all the experienced Users of the Red Bulls.</span></p><p><span style="">Even with such a status, he was given this task, because he was assigned to steal all of the Hahoe Mask&apos;s know how. &#xA0;He was tasked in stealing the Hahoe Mask&apos;s ridiculous hunting method, battle method and any other information that made him special.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;He&apos;s faster than the First One.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">This was why he was confident in his answer. &#xA0;The Hahoe Mask&apos;s hunting speed was faster than the First One when the First One was at the same level as the Hahoe Mask.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;However, the fights are too tight. &#xA0;He doesn&apos;t let up.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">At the same time, he could see the weakness of the Hahoe Mask. The Hahoe Mask fought urgently once he entered into a battle. &#xA0;He had to stay focused throughout in order to finish the battle as fast as possible. &#xA0;This was a clear difference from the First One.</span></p><p><span style="">The First One varied the pace of a battle even during a battle. &#xA0;If he wanted to work fast, he could catch it in 5 minutes. &#xA0;However, he didn&apos;t overwork himself to catch it in 5 minutes. &#xA0;Instead, he hunted slowly to catch it in 10 minutes. It was a method used to delay the fatigue and loss of concentration that developed in battles. &#xA0;The First One used this method to notch an unprecedented amount of play time. &#xA0;He held the record.</span></p><p><span style="">His philosophy was the one who runs the longest beats the sprinter. &#xA0;He was the proof of this philosophy.</span></p><p><span style="">Basically, the Hahoe Mask was a mutation.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;He&apos;s dangerous.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">This was why it was dangerous. &#xA0;The Hahoe Mask had gone against the traditional method. He was using his method to narrow the distance between the First One and the high level Rankers.</span></p><p><span style="">It didn&apos;t matter if it was a small change or a big change. &#xA0;If the Hahoe Mask was able to rise into the level ranking, there would be a change in how things work. The Red Bulls was currently on the top of this existing order, so this change might work against them.</span></p><p><span style="">Bower was deep in his thought, and his face continued to harden.</span></p><p><span style="">- The Hahoe Mask requested for the Last Spot. &#xA0;He wants to know the region with the most monsters.</span></p><p><span style="">When Bower heard the voice of a manager helping out next to the Hahoe Mask, he relaxed his hardened expression.</span></p><p>7.</p><p><span style="">[Hyrkan] </span></p><p><span style="">- Level : 179 </span></p><p><span style="">- Class : Necromancer </span></p><p><span style="">- Title : 144</span></p><p><span style="">- Stats : Strength(2192)/Stamina(1132)/Intelligence(1327)/Magic Power(1601) </span></p><p><span style="">Ahn-jaehyun was checking the Hahoe Mask&apos;s Character. &#xA0;There was a half empty pouch of a jelly drink hanging from his mouth. &#xA0;It was a drink with a difficult name. &#xA0;It was called the Smart Pouch.</span></p><p><span style="">Slurp! </span></p><p><span style="">Ahn-jaehyun quickly sucked the jelly out again, and the pouch shriveled up. &#xA0;He sucked on it until not a single drop of liquid was coming out. &#xA0;Ahn-jaehyun furrowed his brows.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;I only sucked on it couple times, yet it&apos;s all gone?&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">Ahn-jaehyun took the pouch out of his mouth, and he haphazardly tossed it on top of the table. There were three emaciated packs on the table. &#xA0;If one looked a little to the side, there was a black bag with countless emaciated pouches placed in it.</span></p><p><span style="">It was a meal replacement jelly made for patients, who were having a hard time digesting food. &#xA0;This was Ahn-jaehyun&apos;s main meal.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;It is really expensive, tasteless and small in quantity.... Shit. &#xA0;What the hell am I doing?&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">After the Argardo Raid, Ahn-jaehyun&apos;s insides hadn&apos;t calmed down, and he was still in a bad state.</span></p><p><span style="">He had went to the hospital, and a gastroscopy was done. The doctor told him there wasn&apos;t any big problems with him, but he may be suffering from a digestive problem. &#xA0;As a precaution, he was told to refrain from foods that may act as triggers. &#xA0;He was told to lessen his stress, and he was &#xA0;ordered to do physical activities on a regular schedule.</span></p><p><span style="">Of course, the only advice Ahn-jaehyun followed was to avoid eating food that triggered his condition. &#xA0;That was the only one.</span></p><p><span style="">Instead, Ahn-jaehyun played on a more tighter schedule than usual. &#xA0;He had no choice.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;I just need to jump one more level to reach level 180.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">He had negotiated with the Red Bulls. &#xA0;To be precise, he blackmailed them.</span></p><p><span style="">He sent a one-sided message saying he won&apos;t participate in the Immoral Prince Raid until he reached level 180. &#xA0;The Red Bulls had used the Hahoe Mask&apos;s name to sell commercial spots in the live broadcast, so they couldn&apos;t just overlook his message. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">In the end, Red Bulls had to reveal a spot that wasn&apos;t even revealed to the masses yet. &#xA0;They allowed Ahn-jaehyun to use the Black Grooming Lizard&apos;s nest as his hunting ground. &#xA0;They even attached a level up support team to him. &#xA0;This was why everything else other than the actual act of hunting was all provided for by the Red Bulls. &#xA0;They didn&apos;t hesitate to provide him with consumable Items.</span></p><p><span style="">This was a chance that might never come again. &#xA0;His insides were hurting, but he couldn&apos;t pass by this opportunity.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;After I finish my level up, I&apos;ll be going into the Immoral Prince Raid immediately. &#xA0;I have to raise my conditioning as much as possible before that occurs.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">Since he was given this opportunity, Ahn-jaehyun had to be at the top of his game in the Immoral Prince Raid after he reaches level 180. &#xA0;It was probably too much to expect his insides to get better when he considered the various stress he was under.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Still, the events are coming along quite well.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">Fortunately, there hadn&apos;t been much chaos created by the Immoral Prince Raid yet. &#xA0;It wasn&apos;t as if no one had tried to defeat it. &#xA0;The normal users possessing the Battle Tokens allied with each other. &#xA0;They put together the hints given on the Battle Tokens to find the secret location where the Immoral Prince was hiding. &#xA0;Two attempts had been made on the Raid.</span></p><p><span style="">The result of these two attempts were very bleak.</span></p><p><span style="">[The Immoral Prince is unassailable! &#xA0;If the group doesn&apos;t achieve victory, the group is wiped out!] </span></p><p><span style="">[The strongest boss monster in history has appeared. &#xA0;What can be done to clear it?] </span></p><p><span style="">Wiped out! </span></p><p><span style="">If one was able to earn a Battle Token, one was a pretty skilled User in Warlord. &#xA0;However, these Users weren&apos;t able to have an active role against the Immoral Prince. &#xA0;None of them were even able to have a decent fight with the Immoral Prince.</span></p><p><span style="">This was how strong the Immoral Prince was. &#xA0;The footages of the battle with Immoral Prince was released. &#xA0;Even the Hydra, Stormhunters and Red Bulls guild didn&apos;t dare to attempt the Immoral Prince Raid rashly. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">What more explanation was needed?</span></p><p><span style="">This was also the reason why the Red Bulls was helping the Hahoe Mask level up without any complaints. &#xA0;The participation of the Hahoe Mask in the Immoral Prince wasn&apos;t optional anymore. &#xA0;It was a necessity.</span></p><p><span style="">This didn&apos;t mean Ahn-jaehyun was thrilled with the situation.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;This won&apos;t be easy.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">Before he returned to the past, he never experienced fighting the Immoral Prince. &#xA0;He hadn&apos;t dared to fight it. &#xA0;This was the first time he was contemplating a potential fight with the Immoral Prince after seeing the video. &#xA0;The fact that this would be his first experience made a chill run up his spine.</span></p><p><span style="">In truth, the clear method was very simple.</span></p><p><span style="">The Immoral Prince was strong because of the Power of Corruption. &#xA0;It was an ancient power that had been left behind by the Fallen Kingdom. &#xA0;Moreover, relics emitting this ancient power were hidden around the Immoral Prince. &#xA0;Of course, the Immoral Prince would lose significant amount of power every time one of these relics were destroyed.</span></p><p><span style="">In the end, the Immoral Prince Raid was about blocking the Immoral Prince, so it couldn&apos;t interfere with the Relic Destruction Team.</span></p><p><span style="">The content was simple. However, it was hard to carry it out the plan.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;It is much faster than expected.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">The biggest problem was its speed.</span></p><p><span style="">Up until now in Warlord, speed had been a User&apos;s weapon. &#xA0;However, the speed showcased by the Immoral Prince was faster than any User.</span></p><p><span style="">Moreover, the type of skills used by the Immoral Prince was troublesome. &#xA0;His trigonal symbol represented Wisdom, Might and Mission. &#xA0;As someone that represented a symbol with these 3 meanings behind it, the Immoral Prince was able to use skills that was similar to the main skills of the Swordsman class and the Magician class.</span></p><p><span style="">In fact, the Immoral Prince&apos;s skills were significantly more powerful than the skills used by the Users.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;The Skills were strengthen using the Fallen Kingdom&apos;s power. &#xA0;Of course, normal skills can&apos;t hold a candle to it.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">The Skills used by the Immoral Prince was part of the new contents the Users would face once they reached the third part of the Main Scenario Quest. &#xA0;It was the Fallen Kingdom episode.</span></p><p><span style="">Anyways,, the Immoral Prince was a monster that possessed every advantage that a User had. &#xA0;This shouldn&#x2019;t be seen as facing a Raid opponent. &#xA0;One had to think of it as a PVP battle. This was why the Immoral Prince Raid needed multiple skilled Users. &#xA0;One needed experts that could last at least one minute with the Immoral Prince.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;In the end, we have to use our numeric superiority.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">There was the Hydra guild&apos;s Sohank, Red Bull&apos;s Chev, Stormhunter&apos;s Shir and the Hahoe Mask Hyrkan.</span></p><p><span style="">These 4 people would decide whether the Raid would be a success or a bust.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hoo-ooh.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">An automatic sigh came out of Ahn-jaehyun&apos;s mouth when he thought about it. &#xA0;Including himself, there were four people who he knew were skilled enough. &#xA0;On the other hand, would the four Users, who were overflowing with personalities, be able to work together? </span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;I hope the crazy bitch doesn&apos;t fight the crazy bastards.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">Even the thought of it made his insides hurt. &#xA0;Ahn-jaehyun picked up a jelly pouch to calm his stomach. He clamped his mouth over it.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Huh?&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">At that moment, Ahn-jaehyun saw an icon indicating the arrival of an email on his Tablet PC. &#xA0;Ahn-jaehyun lightly touched it with his finger.</span></p><p><span style="">It was sent by Chev.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;What can this be?&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">The content was....</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;In the end, that crazy bitch did something reckless!&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">The Stormhunters guild had gone rogue.</span></p><p>8.</p><p><span style="">&#x2018;No matter how I see it, this is crazy. &#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">Hatch was putting the consumable items into the pockets that was present all over his body. &#xA0;He stopped his movements for a brief moment, and he shook his head from side to side.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;She wants to do the Immoral Prince Raid by ourselves....&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">When the Immoral Prince Raid was failed twice, the Immoral Prince moved to a different location.</span></p><p><span style="">Clues that notified one of the location of the Immoral Prince was given through the Battle Tokens. &#xA0;The Stormhunters guild used their information network, and they were able to find the location immediately. &#xA0;Everything up until that point was business as usual.</span></p><p><span style="">However, when the location was discerned, a special order came down mobilizing the Raid teams on standby for the Immoral Prince Raid.</span></p><p><span style="">She wanted to attempt the Immoral Prince Raid with only the Stormhunters! </span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;The Queen has completely lost her mind.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">This decision couldn&apos;t have come from a rational and logical mind. </span></p><p><span style="">If other words, this was evidence that Shir was idescribably angry.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Well, she had been treated like a complete third wheel up until now. &#xA0;If one considered the Queen&apos;s personality, it is a miracle that she had lasted until now.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">Shir had always received the best spotlights. &#xA0;She had always been in the top spot, yet no one was paying attention to her recently. &#xA0;This lack of interest was a humiliation that was hard for her to endure.</span></p><p><span style="">Moreover, the Hahoe Mask&apos;s fame was piercing through the sky, and without her realizing it, the Red Bulls were being considered the best of the 30 great guilds. &#xA0;This was a definite problem, and she wouldn&apos;t stand for it.</span></p><p><span style="">If one messed with Shir, it was basically pushing a button that made a bomb explode.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;This isn&apos;t the right move.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">At that moment, Hatch mustered up his courage.</span></p><p><span style="">The Stormhunters was Hatch&apos;s place of employment. &#xA0;Warlord was a part of his life now. &#xA0;The cost of a failed raid would be enormous. He was well aware of this fact. &#xA0;If this was inevitable, he had to blunt the damage. &#xA0;When a leader decides to do something reckless, the subordinate had to stop the bleeding.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;In the end, the Queen won&apos;t listen to me if I speak... &#xA0;I have no choice, but to inform the Hydra and Red Bulls.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">Hatch was determined to see this through.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Uh-whew. &#xA0;I have to quickly get out of this guild. &#xA0;If I stay here, I don&apos;t think I&apos;ll live a full life. &#xA0;The hospital said they saw some bleeding from my GI tract. &#xA0;I was told to avoid eating trigger foods, and to avoid stress.....&#x2019;</span></p>
