<p><span style="">Chapter 145 - Frost Knight (1)</span></p><p>1.</p><p><span style="">Hydra, Big Smiles and the Hahoe Mask.</span></p><p><span style="">These three participants had created an incident that had never been seen before. &#xA0;Moreover, the reverberation caused by the struggle for the rights to the Northland was so strong that the topic refused to go away after a day had passed.</span></p><p><span style="">- So we have to ask for permission if we want to go to the Northland?</span></p><p><span style="">- The Hahoe Mask doesn&apos;t have a personal site. &#xA0;Do we have to go to his Youtube page, and ask for his permission in the comment section?</span></p><p><span style="">- I don&apos;t know. &#xA0;In the case of guilds, they keep a fixed schedule regarding the hunting grounds they own. &#xA0;I get the concept of a guild holding the ownership. &#xA0;However, isn&apos;t this case a little bit different? &#xA0;We&apos;ve never had a private User insist on the ownership of a region.</span></p><p><span style="">- &#x3134; The Hahoe Mask fought and won in a fair manner. &#xA0;So what&apos;s the problem? </span></p><p><span style="">- &#x3134; Didn&apos;t the Hahoe Mask ambush Sinclair after he fought Sohank? &#xA0;It wasn&apos;t fair and square.</span></p><p><span style="">- &#x3134; Of course, it is. &#xA0;He fought 30 Users. &#xA0;It was a 30 vs 1 fight, so it is as fair and square as it could be.</span></p><p><span style="">- &#x3134; In truth, I can&apos;t believe the Big Smiles tried a 30 vs 1 fight. &#xA0;I feel a bit bad about the Big Smiles.</span></p><p><span style="">- So when is the Hahoe Mask going to upload his video?</span></p><p><span style="">Even amongst the common Users, the presence of the Hahoe Mask dominated everything.</span></p><p><span style="">The presence of the Hahoe Mask lingered. &#xA0;The Red Bulls guild and 7 additional guilds of the 30 great guilds gave up on conquering the Urugal mountain range. &#xA0;After they abandoned the task, the only challenger left was the Stormhunters guild. &#xA0;However, it seemed they practically ran away from the Urugual mountain after suffering heavy damage. &#xA0;Then there were the stories of the skilled Users that represented the Underfoot guilds. &#xA0;They were receiving VIP treatments from the 30 great guilds. &#xA0;These Users were transferring to the 30 great guilds. &#xA0;Then there was the V&amp;V guild that was continuously rewriting the time records for the Boss Monsters. &#xA0;However, all these news just brushed by the consciousness of the Users. &#xA0;These news wasn&apos;t retained in their memories.</span></p><p><span style="">- If looked at it in a certain way, the Hahoe Mask might be the warlord.</span></p><p><span style="">- Isn&apos;t the strongest User in Warlord called the warlord? &#xA0;Doesn&apos;t that mean the Hahoe Mask is the warlord?</span></p><p><span style="">- If a warlord appears, does this mean it is the end of Warlord?</span></p><p><span style="">- &#x3134; Then the Hahoe Mask will bring this game to an end. &#xA0;Do you this the Tobo Soft plans to erase the Hahoe Mask?</span></p><p><span style="">- &#x3134; Let&apos;s stop talking about the Hahoe Mask.</span></p><p><span style="">Some were uncomfortable with the excessive interest that was paid to the Hahoe Mask.</span></p><p><span style="">There was a scary tornado brewing outside the interest of the Hahoe Mask. &#xA0;However, only a few people realized this fact.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;This is driving me nuts.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">He was so frustrated that a User mumbled out a complaint he shouldn&apos;t have voiced. &#xA0;His character name was Strauss, but he was known more by his nickname and rank. &#xA0;He was the First Head. &#xA0;The User was constantly rubbing at his face. &#xA0;He was one of the few people that saw the hidden storm that was brewing.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;The Hahoe Mask isn&apos;t the important story right now.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">The First Head Strauss had heard the news about Sohank&apos;s failure and he had received Natal&apos;s report. &#xA0;When he heard it, he saw through to the most important issue at hand.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Sohank lost to Sinclair. &#xA0;Sinclair now has the Big Smiles&apos; emblem on his chest. &#xA0;That&#x2019;s the dangerous part.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">Of course, the First Head was very well informed about Sinclair. &#xA0;Moreover, he knew a lot about the Hands guild. &#xA0;The Hands guild had earnestly started their activities through the V&amp;V guild. &#xA0;The First Head wasn&apos;t surprised by it. &#xA0;He surmised it would happen one day.</span></p><p><span style="">However, Sinclair wasn&apos;t the Hands guild expert that represented the V&amp;V guild. &#xA0;The Hydra&apos;s strongest spear, Sohank, was broken by a member of the Big Smiles. &#xA0;When this had occurred, he had thought about the worst scenario that played out like a nightmare.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Are they planning on eating the entire 30 great guilds?&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">The V&amp;V guild was already in the hands of the Hands guild now.</span></p><p><span style="">In a brief amount of time, the Big Smiles guild will also be owned by the Hands guild. &#xA0;Sinclair had defeated Sohank, and he would be treated like a hero in the Big Smiles guild. &#xA0;Of course, the Big Smiles guild will restructure themselves with Sinclair at its core.</span></p><p><span style="">Similar events would start to occurring in the other guilds.</span></p><p><span style="">What would happen next? </span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Shit.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">These Hands guild members will earn political power and they will start gaining a following. &#xA0;They would be able to crush anyone that didn&apos;t listen to them.</span></p><p><span style="">Moreover, the attacks aimed at the Big 3 was very thinly veiled. &#xA0;The Hydra guild had already taken a body blow from the Big Smile guild.</span></p><p><span style="">He couldn&apos;t guarantee it would end at this.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;I shouldn&apos;t have used the Stormhunters as bait when we were trying to catch the Immoral Prince. &#xA0;Instead I should have deepened our relationship.... &#xA0;No. &#xA0;If we had allied ourselves with the Red Bulls or the Stormhunters, they would have just used us.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">In the end, the Hydra guild didn&apos;t have many strong spears in their arsenal. &#xA0;Sohank was really strong. &#xA0;However, if Sohank was excluded, who else was there? &#xA0;If one excluded Chev from the Red Bulls guild, they were overflowing with skilled Users. &#xA0;Aside from the Storm Queen, the Stormhunters had the Storm Princess, Ballista Hatch, and other veteran heroes that had been tempered through numerous Raids. &#xA0;This was why he had tried to form a closer relationship with them. &#xA0;However, this plan became a mess when the Stormhunters guild suddenly attempted the Immortal Prince Raid. &#xA0;It further deteriorated with the appearance of the Hahoe Mask.</span></p><p><span style="">As he was about to go mad as his thoughts reached this point, the First Head started to touch his face again. &#xA0;He ordered his thoughts.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Anyways, there&apos;s no benefit in regretting past events. &#xA0;It isn&apos;t as if I can do anything to change it.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">The hands that was touching his face stopped. &#xA0;The First Head thought about the best path he could take going forward.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;I might have to bet big in recruiting the Whistling Pit Bull. &#xA0;The resources we would have to use would bleed us a lot, but we need a spear that will deter the other guilds from taking our preys. &#xA0;Moreover.... &#xA0;Wasn&apos;t there a User called Challenger Kiyote? &#xA0;He&apos;s making quite a name for himself recently. &#xA0;I have to use this opportunity to rope them in by giving them a VIP treatment.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">Recruiting. </span></p><p><span style="">This was the best method that was available to the Hydra guild. &#xA0;However, the First Head let out a sigh when he thought about the cost that would have to be expended in recruiting these Users.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;I can&apos;t believe I miss my days working at Wall Street.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">He had hated making such calculations, so he had given up his job to play this game. &#xA0;However, this game was forcing him to make similar decisions to his past job.</span></p><p><span style="">At that moment, the First Head couldn&apos;t hold back his sudden laugh.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;At the very least, I have to thank the stars that the Hahoe Mask isn&apos;t part of the Hands guild.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">In a funny way, this thought consoled the First Head&apos;s feeling. &#xA0;It was the fact the the Hahoe Mask wasn&apos;t part of the Hands Guild.</span></p><p><span style="">Up until now, he had considered it quite likely that the Hahoe Mask was a member of the Hands guild. &#xA0;Since the Hahoe Mask and the Hands guild weren&apos;t in it together, it was a big relief for the First Head.</span></p><p><span style="">If the Hahoe Mask had really been a member of the Hands guild, the Hydra guild&#x2019;s hostility towards the the Hands guild wouldn&#x2019;t have mattered.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;If we can rope in the Hahoe Mask, I wouldn&#x2019;t have to worry about any of this....&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">In other words, the Hahoe Mask was the biggest variable. &#xA0;He was a variable that could mess up the Hands guild&apos;s plan.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;&#x2026;&#x2026;just by looking at his recent actions, it is very unlikely that he&apos;ll enter one of the 30 great guilds.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">Moreover, the Hahoe Mask had announced a guild war towards the Big Smiles on the frozen land. &#xA0;It wasn&apos;t just an announcement he gave to the 30 members that was present there. &#xA0;It was a warning and a challenge to all of the 30 great guilds.</span></p><p><span style="">Maybe it was this fact? </span></p><p><span style="">The First Head had been full of worry, but at that moment, he was filled with genuine curiosity about the Hahoe Mask.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;So what is the Hahoe Mask&apos;s ultimate goal? &#xA0;If he simply wanted money and fame, there would have been easier ways to get that.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">What did the Hahoe Mask want to achieve through Warlord?</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;The man doesn&apos;t make any sense to me.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">Even the smart First Head could come up with the answer to that question.</span></p><p>2.</p><p><span style="">This castle once boasted a splendor that couldn&apos;t be described in words. &#xA0;It wasn&#x2019;t a splendor given off by a regular castle. &#xA0;At one time, this place was the capital. &#xA0;It had been the most majestic castle of them all.</span></p><p><span style="">However, this splendid stage was now in ruins. &#xA0;The castle walls were in horrible ruins, and the buildings across the castle wall was in a miserable state. &#xA0;If one looked past the buildings, one could see the traces of the inner castle walls still left over, but the buildings that was suppose to be protected by this inner wall was in a pathetic state. &#xA0;Moreover, there were footprints of some unknowing beings filling up the grounds of the inner castle, and this detail accentuated the appalling state of this place. &#xA0;It was the finishing touch.</span></p><p><span style="">On top of it all, everything was coated in ice and there was a large layer of snow covering everything. This appalling sight gave off a feeling of extreme sadness, and there was an indescribable shabbiness that was pervasive.</span></p><p><span style="">Two groups were using this stage as a battle ground.</span></p><p><span style="">One group consisted of Orcs with leathers that had turned pale. &#xA0;Instead of weapons, these Orcs used their sharp frozen arms to attack. &#xA0;The Orcs didn&apos;t possess heat, eyes, vitality or vigor of living beings. </span></p><p><span style="">The other group facing the Cursed Orc horde wasn&apos;t all that different from them. &#xA0;They were wearing very stylish armors, and they held excellent blades that was well-used. &#xA0;However, the most pervasive detail about the Skeleton Warriors was the sure proof of death they possessed.</span></p><p><span style="">This was a battle between beings that couldn&apos;t die.</span></p><p><span style="">None of them could let out any sound, so in a way, one would assume that the battle would have been silent.</span></p><p><span style="">Kah-ahng, kah-ahng! </span></p><p><span style="">However, the sounds of steels clashing was more powerful than any lame shout or roar.</span></p><p><span style="">Moreover, the sound they produced varied immensely.</span></p><p><span style="">Kwah-ahng, kwah-ahng! </span></p><p><span style="">The swords swung by the Skeleton Warriors were breaking the frozen skin of the Orcs. The sound was cheerful and heavy at the same same time.</span></p><p><span style="">Ggee-eee-eee-eee! </span></p><p><span style="">The Cursed Orcs were frozen solid, and they were sturdier than most swords. &#xA0;Their sharp arms were swung to damage the armors of the Skeleton Warriors. &#xA0;The sound it made was goosebump inducing yet sharp.</span></p><p><span style="">These two groups were tirelessly carrying out the battle, and the sound that was being emitted was so rhythmic that it sounded like a music ensemble.</span></p><p><span style="">Moreover, these beings looked as if they would be able to carry out this diverse performance until the end of time.</span></p><p><span style="">The broken body of the Orcs were surprisingly being healed by the blizzard. &#xA0;Even a deep wound was mended when snow covered it.</span></p><p><span style="">It was the same for the Skeleton Warriors, but it was the responsibility of another being to mend their wounds. &#xA0;It was the responsibility of the owner. </span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Busy. &#xA0;I&apos;m so busy.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan was the owner of the Skeleton Warriors, and he never retreated on the battlefield. &#xA0;In a battle between the Undeads, he was doing something funny.</span></p><p><span style="">When a Cursed Orc&apos;s body received a critical blow, it tried to repair its crumbled body. &#xA0;Hyrkan searched through the pile. &#xA0;He was like a cat searching through a trash bin. &#xA0;Instead of using his sword, he could be seen holding a bottle, and he was spraying holy water on the item he had found. &#xA0;This wasn&apos;t a look of a veteran hero that fought in front of the fearless Skeleton Warriors should be showing.</span></p><p><span style="">[The Cursed Orc&apos;s Curse is dispelled.] </span></p><p><span style="">However, at that moment, Hyrkan wasn&apos;t lamenting or smiling in self-deprecation. &#xA0;He was actually struck by admiration.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;I&apos;ve been feeling this for awhile now, but... The Stormhunters must had shit blood when they first hunted here.</span></p><p><span style="">Twenty days.</span></p><p><span style="">It had been 20 days since Hyrkan had entered the Frozen Kingdom&apos;s territory after passing the frozen land.</span></p><p><span style="">This wasn&apos;t a short amount of time. &#xA0;During this period, he faced monsters that were dead, but they were still moving in their frozen state. </span></p><p><span style="">Of course, these monsters didn&apos;t possess only the simple abilities that came with a frozen monster.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;The difficulty of this game is really fucked up.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">The basic setup was that the monsters had been cursed by the Frost Dragon.</span></p><p><span style="">They couldn&apos;t die on their own, and even deep wounds would regenerate within a snowstorm. &#xA0;This terrifying curse wouldn&apos;t disappear since the weather wouldn&apos;t change here. These monsters were cursed as they suffered an endlessly pathetic fate.</span></p><p><span style="">Of course, from the User&apos;s point of view, the frozen body significantly increased the monster&apos;s defense. &#xA0;Moreover, they held properties of an Undead, which was even harder to kill. Even if one made a critical wound, the endless snowstorm would heal the wound in short order.... &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">This was a commonly spoken phrase among Users. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">&apos;The Users weren&apos;t meant to catch these monsters. &#xA0;Instead, these monsters made the Users hunt down the game planner that came up with this monster design.&apos;</span></p><p><span style="">Of course, this begs the question.</span></p><p><span style="">What method allowed Hyrkan to use these ridiculous monsters as his hunting fodder as he leveled up? &#xA0;Moreover, he hadn&apos;t done this for just one or two days. &#xA0;He had spent 20 days fighting here, so how was he able to make these monsters his prey?</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;I&apos;m really curious. &#xA0;How the hell did the Storhunters catch these guys without the holy water?&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">In the end, it was all thanks to the Stormhunters.</span></p><p><span style="">He had learned from the Stormhunters on how to deal with the monsters cursed by the Frost Dragons. &#xA0;The monsters had an emblem that was the source of their curse. &#xA0;If one sprayed holy water on top of this emblem, the curse was dispelled. &#xA0;The Stormhunters guild had found this out by clashing against these monsters.</span></p><p><span style="">[Your level has increased.] </span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan had heard this Announcement for his 198th and 199th level up. &#xA0;It was all thanks to the Stormhunters.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Ok.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">When he heard the Announcement he had been anticipating, Hyrkan clenched his fist.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Oppa&apos;s magic is replenished! &#xA0;All of you get ready to die!&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">Hwah-roo-roo! </span></p><p><span style="">From between Hyrkan&apos;s clenched fists, flame erupted outwards. &#xA0;When Hyrkan unclenched his fist, the flame shot up into the sky.</span></p><p><span style="">The burst of flame opened its mouth wide, and it started to take shape.</span></p><p><span style="">[The Orcs have been cursed by the Fire Golem&apos;s Heat. &#xA0;Their Defense will lessen.] </span></p><p><span style="">Hwal hwal! </span></p><p><span style="">This giant made from flame possessed powerful fire that made the snow into steam in an instant.</span></p><p><span style="">The Fire Golem&apos;s presence was on a different level as it appeared. &#xA0;The Fire Golem was letting out heat, and the it was making the frozen body of the Orcs melt steadily.</span></p><p><span style="">Of course, at the same time, Hyrkan&apos;s magical energy was also being consumed rapidly akin to the snow melting.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;I can&apos;t waste any more consumable Items from this point on. I have to pull out after taking them out all at once!&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">At that moment, Hyrkan decided to end the battle as soon as possible.</span></p><p><span style="">Ddahk ddahk! </span></p><p><span style="">His will was conveyed into his finger as he flicked it twice. &#xA0;It basically ordered the Skeleton Warriors to become more aggressive in their attacks.</span></p><p><span style="">Ddul-goo-ruhk, dul-goo-ruhk! </span></p><p><span style="">The Skeleton Warriors reacted to their owner&apos;s order. &#xA0;They aggressively drove into the Cursed Orcs.</span></p><p><span style="">Kwah-jeek! </span></p><p><span style="">To be precise, the melting of the ice would lower the defense, but it would also decrease the physical abilities of the Cursed Orcs. &#xA0;The Skeleton Warriors were starting to overwhelm the Cursed Orcs. </span></p><p><span style="">It looked very funny, but Hyrkan once again started his important task. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">Choo-roong choo-roong!</span></p><p><span style="">Instead of carrying his weeping Crying Sword, he held a bottle of holy water. &#xA0;He search for the Orc&apos;s Curse Emblem, and he splashed it with holy water.</span></p><p><span style="">One, two.... &#xA0;Hyrkan kept up with his ridiculous task, and when he reached 50, the Orcs numbered in the single digits. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">Of course, Hyrkan continued on with this ridiculous form of battle, but it seemed he wouldn&apos;t be able to end all the Cursed Orcs once and for all. </span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Ah!&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">An abrupt end came to his ridiculous looking work. &#xA0;The bottle with the holy water was empty.</span></p><p><span style="">However, there were still seven Cursed Orcs left! &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">The apparent state of his holy water should have left him flustered.</span></p><p><span style="">However, he had a determined expression instead of being flustered. &#xA0;He firmly closed his mouth.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;I&apos;ve reached that point.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">He had run out of the holy water. &#xA0;It was a signal.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;I can&apos;t believe I&apos;ve made it this far.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">This was a signal that signified the final showdown. &#xA0;He had to put everything he had done to this point behind him.</span></p><p><span style="">It was as if it had read Hyrkan&apos;s mind.</span></p><p><span style="">Suddenly, a powerful coldness swept across the ruins of the nameless castle.</span></p><p><span style="">Zzuh-juh-juhng! </span></p><p><span style="">When the coldness swept over him, frost grew on top of his armor like new buds. It was an unfathomable coldness.</span></p><p><span style="">[The Frost Knight is raging.] </span></p><p><span style="">[The Cursed Beings will awakened by the Frost Knight&apos;s rage.] </span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Frost Knight.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">In front of the coldness, Hyrkan started reminiscing for a brief moment.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;This bastard&#x2026;&#x2026; This was that bitch&apos;s ultimate accomplishment.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">For a brief time, Storm Queen Shir had been the strongest User in Warlord... This was the video that had made her almost synonymous with Warlord.</span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan had hated her very much, but that particular video allowed him to acknowledge her skill, talent, competence and iron will.</span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan reminisced on that video.</span></p>
