<p><strong>Chapter 92 Elf&apos;s Keepsake (2).</strong></p><p></p><div id="chapterContent" class="innerContent fr-view"><p></p><p></p><p dir="ltr">Chapter 92 - Elf&apos;s Keepsake (2)</p><p></p><p></p><p dir="ltr">5.</p><p></p><p></p><p dir="ltr">He was a magician that represented the Stormhunter guild. &#xA0;At that moment, Hatch was feeling regret.</p><p></p><p></p><p dir="ltr">&#x2018;Shit.&#x2019;</p><p></p><p></p><p dir="ltr">Hatch&apos;s gaze headed towards his leader, Storm Queen Shir. &#xA0;The always beautiful woman seemed to be in a foul mood. &#xA0;In truth, she was a woman, who usually didn&apos;t have a bright expression on her face. Currently, she had on such a ferocious expression that no one dared to crack a joke.</p><p></p><p></p><p dir="ltr">&#x2018;Why did I have to bring that up?&#x2019;</p><p></p><p></p><p dir="ltr">Hatch had carelessly let slip some words.</p><p></p><p></p><p dir="ltr">Of course, Hatch didn&apos;t think he said anything that would offend Shir... &#xA0;He hadn&apos;t called her a spinster, who never had a boyfriend before! &#xA0;He hadn&apos;t said something &#xA0;inflammatory like that.</p><p></p><p></p><p dir="ltr">He really said something innocuous.</p><p></p><p></p><p dir="ltr">&#x2018;Why do I have to suffer like this because of the Hahoe Mask?&#x2019;</p><p></p><p></p><p dir="ltr">Hahoe Mask.</p><p></p><p></p><p dir="ltr">Most Warlord users knew of his name by now. &#xA0;When Hatch saw a uploaded vid with him in it, he unconsciously spoke about it.</p><p></p><p></p><p dir="ltr">&apos;Hey, the Hahoe Mask&apos;s hunting video is up.&apos;</p><p></p><p></p><p dir="ltr">That was all Hatch had said.</p><p></p><p></p><p dir="ltr">The problem was Shir had immediately reacted to those words. After checking the footage, her expression changed. &#xA0;She gave off a murderous intent as she spat out her words.</p><p></p><p></p><p dir="ltr">&#x201C;Why is he ignoring the love calls we sent? &#xA0;Why is he hunting with a minor user from the Golden Brothers? Why is the Hahoe Mask keep turning down our requests?&#x201D;</p><p></p><p></p><p dir="ltr">At that moment, the members of Stormhunter&apos;s Raid team were gathered around Shir, and they kept their mouths shut. They would experience a huge calamity if they agitated Shir when she was in a foul mood.</p><p></p><p></p><p dir="ltr">However, Shir&apos;s mood didn&apos;t show any signs of improving. After some time passed, the other members glared at Hatch with resentment.</p><p></p><p></p><p dir="ltr">&apos;Why did you have to open your big mouth? &#xA0;Why did you have to create such an atmosphere?&#x2019;</p><p></p><p></p><p dir="ltr">From Hatch&apos;s perspective, he really felt regret over his action.</p><p></p><p></p><p dir="ltr">However, he couldn&apos;t take out his anger on anyone. &#xA0;There was only one thing he could do in his current situation.</p><p></p><p></p><p dir="ltr">&#x2018;Hahoe Mask. &#xA0;If you join our guild, you are dead.&#x2019;</p><p></p><p></p><p dir="ltr">He enthusiastically cussed out the Hahoe Mask.</p><p></p><p></p><p dir="ltr">6.</p><p></p><p></p><p dir="ltr">Hyrkan had been running diligently when he stopped for a moment.</p><p></p><p></p><p dir="ltr">&#x2018;Is someone calling me?&#x2019;</p><p></p><p></p><p dir="ltr">Hyrkan turned to look, and his vision didn&apos;t pick up anyone. He thought someone had called out his name, but of course, he didn&apos;t hear any voices.</p><p></p><p></p><p dir="ltr">Hyrkan shook his head from side to side.</p><p></p><p></p><p dir="ltr">&#x2018;Some bastard must be talking smack about me.&#x2019;</p><p></p><p></p><p dir="ltr">Accompanying that brief thought, Hyrkan&apos;s gaze headed towards a peak of a particular mountain. &#xA0;The peak of the mountain was shaped oddly. &#xA0;The peak looked like a bird&apos;s head. &#xA0;It was very similar in appearance to an eagle&apos;s head.</p><p></p><p></p><p dir="ltr">&#x2018;I&apos;m almost there.&#x2019;</p><p></p><p></p><p dir="ltr">Eagle Mountain.</p><p></p><p></p><p dir="ltr">This was a location where monsters between level 80 and 90 appeared. &#xA0;Amongst the users, this location had long been a popular hunting ground.</p><p></p><p></p><p dir="ltr">Of course, this wasn&apos;t Hyrkan&apos;s destination.</p><p></p><p></p><p dir="ltr">&#x2018;I have to head northeast from the Eagle Mountain.&#x2019;</p><p></p><p></p><p dir="ltr">Hyrkan took out a note from his pocket. There were words on the bottom of the page that hadn&apos;t been there originally.</p><p></p><p></p><p dir="ltr">&#x2018;I saved a lot of time when all of this was resolved by the Maeung.&#x2019;</p><p></p><p></p><p dir="ltr">The owner of the handwriting was Bulkas Ranger&apos;s Captain, Maeung.</p><p></p><p></p><p dir="ltr">The first person Hyrkan had visited with the Elf&apos;s Keepsake was the Maeung. &#xA0;He planned on visiting the Maeung, Drah and Ahimbree in that order. &#xA0;If he was unlucky, he wouldn&apos;t get any answer from all three of them. Fortunately, he got an immediate answer from his first visit. &#xA0;Maeung spoke about the map and the note.</p><p></p><p></p><p dir="ltr">&#x201C;If the Corrupted Elf, who betrayed the Baheim tribe, gave this to you with his dying breath, then the location listed here must be related to those bastards. &#xA0;The probability is high.&#x201D;</p><p></p><p></p><p dir="ltr">&#x201C;Can you decipher this map and note?&#x201D;</p><p></p><p></p><p dir="ltr">&#x201C;I don&apos;t know about the map, but I can immediately translate the content of the note.&#x201D;</p><p></p><p></p><p dir="ltr">Maeung immediately translated the content of the note.</p><p></p><p></p><p dir="ltr">&#x201C;The place where the eagle watches. &#xA0;The place is surrounded by blue mists, and there is a secret village between them.&#x201D;</p><p></p><p></p><p dir="ltr">&#x2018;Uh?&#x2019;</p><p></p><p></p><p dir="ltr">When he heard those words, he immediately knew where the village was located at.</p><p></p><p></p><p dir="ltr">&#x201C;I don&apos;t know where this place is located at. &#xA0;The clues are too vague.&#x201D;</p><p></p><p></p><p dir="ltr">This was why Hyrkan spoke with confidence.</p><p></p><p></p><p dir="ltr">&#x201C;I&apos;ll go find and visit this place.&#x201D;</p><p></p><p></p><p dir="ltr">&#x201C;You will?&#x201D;</p><p></p><p></p><p dir="ltr">&#x201C;Aren&apos;t I the only one available right now to do this job? Of course, I believe this is a job I should do.&#x201D;</p><p></p><p></p><p dir="ltr">Maeung was deeply moved by his words. &#xA0;He patted Hyrkan&apos;s shoulder.</p><p></p><p></p><p dir="ltr">&#x201C;Thank you.&#x201D;</p><p></p><p></p><p dir="ltr">[Quest &apos;Elf&apos;s Keepsake&apos; has started.]</p><p></p><p></p><p dir="ltr">It had been two days since he received the Quest from Maeung.</p><p></p><p></p><p dir="ltr">Hyrkan looked at the Eagle Mountain. &#xA0;He followed the direction where the Eagle&apos;s head was looking towards to. It was looking towards the northeast.</p><p></p><p></p><p dir="ltr">&#x2018;I&apos;m sure that&apos;s the Blue Mist Forest.&#x2019;</p><p></p><p></p><p dir="ltr">The Eagle was looking towards a location where blue mists obscured the surrounding.</p><p></p><p></p><p dir="ltr">Those were words that described the Blue Mist Forest. &#xA0;He had never visited the location, but Hyrkan remembered the place.</p><p></p><p></p><p dir="ltr">It was a hunting ground for level 100 to level 130. The difficulty level of this hunting ground was much higher compared to the hunting grounds of similar level.</p><p></p><p></p><p dir="ltr">The reason why the Blue Mist Forest was difficult was the existence of humanoid monsters called the Smogrians. Its body was mainly made out of blue fog. It didn&apos;t have strong offense or defense, but they were similar to the Undead type monsters. &#xA0;They had a powerful regeneration ability. &#xA0;Moreover, it was very difficult to sense their presence within the Blue Mist Forest.</p><p></p><p></p><p dir="ltr">In fact, it was hard for users in the same party to keep track of each other within the Blue Mist Forest. &#xA0;It was inevitable for this place to be difficult.</p><p></p><p></p><p dir="ltr">This was why no one went there.</p><p></p><p></p><p dir="ltr">Most users avoided going to this hunting ground, and in the past, Hyrkan had no reason to visit this location.</p><p></p><p></p><p dir="ltr">However, it was different for him right now. &#xA0;There were multiple reasons why Hyrkan had to visit the Blue Mist Forest.</p><p></p><p></p><p dir="ltr">&#x2018;I have to hurry up and get there.&#x2019;</p><p></p><p></p><p dir="ltr">Quest? Of course, it was one of the reasons why he wanted to get there. &#xA0;However, he had an additional reason.</p><p></p><p></p><p dir="ltr">&#x2018;I have to get there before some other bastard eats my Title!&#x2019;</p><p></p><p></p><p dir="ltr">The Blue Mist Forest region had been inaccessible, because of the Block Field. &#xA0;This was the reason why the Eagle Mountain was a popular hunting ground for users. &#xA0;The Block Field basically prevented any higher level monsters from entering the field.</p><p></p><p></p><p dir="ltr">When Hyrkan received the quest to go to this location, the Block Field had been cancelled.</p><p></p><p></p><p dir="ltr">If he was the first one to reach the location, he would be able to earn the Titles.</p><p></p><p></p><p dir="ltr">&#x201C;Hoo-ooh!&#x201D;</p><p></p><p></p><p dir="ltr">Hyrkan let out his breathe, and he started to run again.</p><p></p><p></p><p dir="ltr">7.</p><p></p><p></p><p dir="ltr">[You&apos;ve earned the Title &apos;Visitor of the Blue Mist Forest&#x2019;.]</p><p></p><p></p><p dir="ltr">[You&apos;ve earned the Title &apos;Discoverer of the Blue Mist Forest&#x2019;.]</p><p></p><p></p><p dir="ltr">The moment he heard the Title Announcement Hyrkan put on a big smile.</p><p></p><p></p><p dir="ltr">Hyrkan immediately check the Title Option.</p><p></p><p></p><p dir="ltr">[Visitor of the Blue Mist Forest]</p><p></p><p></p><p dir="ltr">Title Effect : Stamina +3, Magic Power +3</p><p></p><p></p><p dir="ltr">[Discoverer of the Blue Mist Forest]</p><p></p><p></p><p dir="ltr">Title Effect : Strength +10, Intelligence +10</p><p></p><p></p><p dir="ltr">The Titles had better Options than he thought it would have.</p><p></p><p></p><p dir="ltr">&#x2018;This is why users put their lives on the line for the Titles. &#xA0;This is the taste.&#x2019;</p><p></p><p></p><p dir="ltr">If he looked at it from a strictly numerical perspective, he had just earned Stats equivalent to gaining 5 levels in one sitting. &#xA0;Currently, it took Hyrkan 3 days to level up once. &#xA0;So this was quite the boon for him.</p><p></p><p></p><p dir="ltr">However, his happiness ended there.</p><p></p><p></p><p dir="ltr">&#x2018;So what do I have to do here?&#x2019;</p><p></p><p></p><p dir="ltr">It was hard to even think of this place as a forest. &#xA0;The blue fog was everywhere, and it tamped down the happiness he had felt when earning the Blue Mist Forest Titles.</p><p></p><p></p><p dir="ltr">&#x2018;I&apos;m pretty sure this place was never mentioned before.&#x2019;</p><p></p><p></p><p dir="ltr">The Main Scenario Quest route within Hyrkan&apos;s head didn&apos;t have the Blue Mist Forest as a destination.</p><p></p><p></p><p dir="ltr">Of course, the Main Scenario had several routes. &#xA0;Hyrkan couldn&apos;t remember every one of those routes. If he had such good memory, he would have studied hard during his school days. &#xA0;He would have entered a good college, and he would be living a completely different life.</p><p></p><p></p><p dir="ltr">Still, he remembered most of the important parts.</p><p></p><p></p><p dir="ltr">However, the word, Blue Mist Forest, didn&apos;t ring a bell within his memory.</p><p></p><p></p><p dir="ltr">&#x2018;Is this perhaps an Event Quest?&#x2019;</p><p></p><p></p><p dir="ltr">There was a possibility this was an Event Quest. &#xA0;This would be an Event Quest specifically made for those progressing through the Main Scenario Quest. &#xA0;The expensive items related to the Main Scenario Quest.... &#xA0;It was the Chronicle Rare. &#xA0;The Rewards that might be given may be Chronicle Ranked items.</p><p></p><p></p><p dir="ltr">He would avoid a loss if one came out. &#xA0;It would be a jackpot.</p><p></p><p></p><p dir="ltr">On the other hand, if a Quest route that he was unfamiliar with shows up, it would cause considerable amount of trouble for him.</p><p></p><p></p><p dir="ltr">Of course, the fact that he had to finish this particular Quest didn&apos;t change.</p><p></p><p></p><p dir="ltr">Hyrkan once again checked the content of the Quest.</p><p></p><p></p><p dir="ltr">[Elf&apos;s Keepsake]</p><p></p><p></p><p dir="ltr">- Quest Rank : Unique</p><p></p><p></p><p dir="ltr">- Quest Level Range : Over level 100</p><p></p><p></p><p dir="ltr">- Quest Content : Find the location being pointed by the Corrupted Elf&apos;s Keepsake. &#xA0;Find out Anuah&apos;s secret.</p><p></p><p></p><p dir="ltr">- Quest Reward : Someone&apos;s Keepsake.</p><p></p><p></p><p dir="ltr">The pressure within Hyrkan&apos;s chest increased by a lot.</p><p></p><p></p><p dir="ltr">&#x2018;This is really endless.&#x2019;</p><p></p><p></p><p dir="ltr">He had to find the place indicated by the Keepsake, and he had to find the secret! &#xA0;It was a really open ended instruction.</p><p></p><p></p><p dir="ltr">Moreover, the reward was &apos;Someone&apos;s Keepsake.&apos;</p><p></p><p></p><p dir="ltr">This matter wasn&apos;t funny at all.</p><p></p><p></p><p dir="ltr">&#x2018;Well, Warlord is always like this.&#x2019;</p><p></p><p></p><p dir="ltr">However, Hyrkan had only one choice when standing in front of a Quest.</p><p></p><p></p><p dir="ltr">Complete the Quest!</p><p></p><p></p><p dir="ltr">If he didn&apos;t complete this quest, it would be impossible for him to progress any further.</p><p></p><p></p><p dir="ltr">Hyrkan organized his situation.</p><p></p><p></p><p dir="ltr">Hyrkan had to battle in this place using every method available to him.</p><p></p><p></p><p dir="ltr">Moreover, Hyrkan had never faced the monsters that appear within the Blue Mist Forest.</p><p></p><p></p><p dir="ltr">Since it said to find a secret, he had to brace himself for the eventuality of combing through the Blue Mist Forest.</p><p></p><p></p><p dir="ltr">If he combined all these facts, it became apparent what Hyrkan had to do.</p><p></p><p></p><p dir="ltr">Hyrkan threw 3 Skeleton Fragments.</p><p></p><p></p><p dir="ltr">&#x2018;Shall I get acclimated to this place first?&#x2019;</p><p></p><p></p><p dir="ltr">Battle.</p><p></p><p></p><p dir="ltr">That is what Hyrkan had to do now.</p><p></p><p></p><p dir="ltr">8.</p><p></p><p></p><p dir="ltr">They were human shaped monsters made out of Blue Mist. &#xA0;A gold colored blade arced swiftly towards the monster&apos;s head.</p><p></p><p></p><p dir="ltr">Kwahng!</p><p></p><p></p><p dir="ltr">The sword obliterated the Smogrian&apos;s head. If this was a person, it would have been a critical wound or a deathblow.</p><p></p><p></p><p dir="ltr">However, the Smogrian still moved well without its head. In fact, the neck with its head removed was bubbling. &#xA0;The bubbles formed, and it started to harden in due time. Its head was regrowing.</p><p></p><p></p><p dir="ltr">This was the time to ruthlessly attack the monster before its head could reform.</p><p></p><p></p><p dir="ltr">However, Hyrkan ignored the one without its head. &#xA0;He moved towards another monster.</p><p></p><p></p><p dir="ltr">He was well aware of the Smogrian&apos;s regenerative ability.</p><p></p><p></p><p dir="ltr">Ddul-goo-ruhk, ddul-goo-ruhk!</p><p></p><p></p><p dir="ltr">However, Hyrkan had put his trust in his Skeleton Warriors. &#xA0;They would finish the monster.</p><p></p><p></p><p dir="ltr">It was as if they reacted to Hyrkan&apos;s trust. &#xA0;Two Skeleton Warriors appeared from the fog, and they started stabbing the headless body of the Smogrian.</p><p></p><p></p><p dir="ltr">Kwahng, kwahng!</p><p></p><p></p><p dir="ltr">The sword swung by the Skeleton Warriors ruthlessly broke down the Smogrian&apos;s body. &#xA0;The blows were that powerful.</p><p></p><p></p><p dir="ltr">During all of this, Hyrkan had demolished another head of a Smogrian, and he was moving on to the next target.</p><p></p><p></p><p dir="ltr">&#x2018;Chet.&#x2019;</p><p></p><p></p><p dir="ltr">However, the thick fog prevented Hyrkan from moving farther away. &#xA0;The fog was so thick that he was barely able to see the burning eyes of the Skeleton Warriors. &#xA0;Of course, it was impossible to check how many Smogrians there were.</p><p></p><p></p><p dir="ltr">&#x2018;It feels like I&apos;m surrounded, yet I don&apos;t know how many there are....&#x2019;</p><p></p><p></p><p dir="ltr">Hooooong!</p><p></p><p></p><p dir="ltr">At that moment, an enormous club parted the air from behind Hyrkan, and an incredibly scary sound was heard.</p><p></p><p></p><p dir="ltr">Hyrkan dived to the side in fright.</p><p></p><p></p><p dir="ltr">Kwahng!</p><p></p><p></p><p dir="ltr">A large club landed where Hyrkan had been standing.</p><p></p><p></p><p dir="ltr">The 7 meter tall Ogre Golem had swung its club. &#xA0;It was an attack aimed at the Smogrian in front of Hyrkan, but Hyrkan had been in the way.</p><p></p><p></p><p dir="ltr">Hyrkan yelled out as he was barely able to dodge it.</p><p></p><p></p><p dir="ltr">&#x201C;You son of a bitch! You cost me a lot, yet you dare to attack me!&#x201D;</p><p></p><p></p><p dir="ltr">Of course, the Golem couldn&apos;t understand Hyrkan&apos;s words. &#xA0;The Golem ignored Hyrkan&apos;s words. It seemed it had adopted the AI of the barbaric ogre. &#xA0;The Golem attacked recklessly, and it indiscriminately swung its club towards the Smogrians.</p><p></p><p></p><p dir="ltr">Kwahng, kwahng!</p><p></p><p></p><p dir="ltr">The Ogre Golem was well worth the money. &#xA0;Every time the Ogre Golem swung its club it destroyed a Smogrian with a single strike. &#xA0;They weren&apos;t just destroyed. &#xA0;They were blown to pieces.</p><p></p><p></p><p dir="ltr">The Ogre Golem probably caught more Smogrians than Hyrkan.</p><p></p><p></p><p dir="ltr">[Your level has increased.]</p><p></p><p></p><p dir="ltr">The Golem caused Hyrkan to level up, so he decided to look more kindly at the Ogre Golem&apos;s mistake.</p><p></p><p></p><p dir="ltr">Hyrkan had recovered all his of his Magic Power and Stamina.</p><p></p><p></p><p dir="ltr">&#x2018;I&apos;ll overlook this since I leveled up.&#x2019;</p><p></p><p></p><p dir="ltr">Hyrkan immediately activated the Bone Armor Skill, and the Madness Helm. It felt as if the strengthened Skeleton Warriors didn&apos;t want to lose to the Ogre Golem. &#xA0;The Skeleton Warriors once again attacked in a berserk state.</p><p></p><p></p><p dir="ltr">Hyrkan also readied himself to move.</p><p></p><p></p><p dir="ltr">&#x2018;Huh?&#x2019;</p><p></p><p></p><p dir="ltr">However, Hyrkan&apos;s eyes picked up Smogrians he hadn&apos;t seen before. &#xA0;It meant the Smogrians had tightened the perimeter around Hyrkan and his minions. At a glance, he could see over twenty of them.</p><p></p><p></p><p dir="ltr">&#x2018;Huh huh.&#x2019;</p><p></p><p></p><p dir="ltr">Hyrkan let out a false laugh when he saw their excessive number.</p><p></p><p></p><p dir="ltr">&#x2018;The Battlefield felt like childsplay compared to this.&#x2019;</p><p></p><p></p><p dir="ltr">It had been 15 days since he had entered the Blue Mist Forest.</p><p></p><p></p><p dir="ltr">During that time, Hyrkan had raised 6 levels, and he had reached level 107. &#xA0;The level up pace was extremely fast, and it was thanks to the incredibly numerous population of Smogrians.</p><p></p><p></p><p dir="ltr">Truthfully, it was a blessing to be able to catch so many monsters. &#xA0;Currently, the Warlord was devoid of monsters to catch for the beginner users. &#xA0;It was so bad that users watched videos of other users hunting or they watched the televised shows to pass the time.</p><p></p><p></p><p dir="ltr">Still, even the great Hyrkan had to pull out from the battle at a certain point. &#xA0;If one thought about Hyrkan&apos;s skill, this was inconceivable.</p><p></p><p></p><p dir="ltr">The thing that frustrated Hyrkan the most was the fact that he wasn&apos;t able to search the forest the way he wanted. &#xA0;There were too many monsters to do that.</p><p></p><p></p><p dir="ltr">The thick blue fog made it impossible to see the terrain. &#xA0;Even if one wanted to follow the map, there were too many Smogrians swarming him. &#xA0;He couldn&apos;t move to where he wanted. It was like navigating a maze with one&apos;s eyes closed.</p><p></p><p></p><p dir="ltr">Of course, it wasn&apos;t as if he was devoid of any option.</p><p></p><p></p><p dir="ltr">After re-gripping his sword, Hykran looked forward.</p><p></p><p></p><p dir="ltr">&#x2018;Shall I just blast through?&#x2019;</p><p></p><p></p><p dir="ltr">He decided to charge without looking back!</p><p></p><p></p><p dir="ltr">If he didn&apos;t worry about retreating, he could force his way through to a direction he wanted to travel.</p><p></p><p></p><p dir="ltr">Of course, his escape route would be cut off. &#xA0;If he was unlucky, it would be Game Over. &#xA0;He had kept this plan as a last resort.</p><p></p><p></p><p dir="ltr">However, he couldn&apos;t hunt indefinitely here.</p><p></p><p></p><p dir="ltr">&#x2018;If an answer doesn&apos;t come out before I reach level 110&#x2026;&#x2026;.&#x2019;</p><p></p><p></p><p dir="ltr">Hyrkan made a resolution.</p><p></p><p></p></div><p></p>
