<p><span style="">Chapter 149 - Ancient Power (2)</span></p><p>3.</p><p><span style="">Flash! </span></p><p><span style="">In truth, the mattress he was lying on was unable to perform its original purpose, but Ahn-jaehyun was draped over it like a corpse. &#xA0;A blanket that was about to decay made the worn out mattress look shabbier. &#xA0;When both of his eyes opened, he kicked hard at the blanket.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ora ora ora!&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">He let out a energetic shout as he got up. &#xA0;It was hard to believe that Ahn-jaehyun had been lying on the mattress like a lifeless corpse a moment ago. &#xA0;He was showing a frightening level of energy as he walked towards the restroom.</span></p><p><span style="">He immediately put a big dollop of toothpaste on his toothbrush, then he looked at himself through the small mirror inside his restroom. &#xA0;He was quite skinny. &#xA0;He was in a sorry state where eating meat for a month straight might not be able to fix him. &#xA0;However, he thought he looked better than ever as he looked at his own reflection in the mirror.</span></p><p><span style="">If he was to exaggerate it a little bit, he looked like Leonardo DiCaprio in his prime when he failed to win his second Oscar. &#xA0;That was how great he thought he looked.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;It is done!&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">This was how much Ahn-jaehyun&apos;s mind was set on what he&#x2019;ll do.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Wait for me. &#xA0;I&apos;ll kill any bastard that blocks my way. &#xA0;If anyone bothers the Hahoe Mask, I&apos;ll fuck them over.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">Moreover, he was now qualified to think this way.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ooh-buh-buh-buh!&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">He couldn&apos;t help, but laugh even as he brushed his teeth. &#xA0;He was so happy that it was as if he was losing his mind.</span></p><p><span style="">Of course, the reason for his happiness was the game.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Frost! I got the Frost! &#xA0;Ooh-ha-ha-ha!&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">He had caught the Frost Knight 8 hours ago.</span></p><p><span style="">He immediately logged out after finishing the Frost Knight Raid. &#xA0;When he came back to reality, he went straight to sleep.</span></p><p><span style="">It wasn&apos;t as if he didn&apos;t have work to do. &#xA0;Actually, he had too many things on his agenda to do. &#xA0;He had to organize the footages he recorded, then he had to check what was going on in Warlord. &#xA0;He also had to calculate his bottom line.</span></p><p><span style="">However, he just went straight to sleep. &#xA0;It was true that he was tired from the Frost Knight Raid, but that wasn&apos;t the deciding factor. &#xA0;There was another reason.</span></p><p><span style="">His head was too crowded with miscellaneous thoughts. &#xA0;The inside of his head was a jumbled mess, and he couldn&apos;t organize his thoughts in his tired state. &#xA0;This was the reason why he had slept.</span></p><p><span style="">Then 8 hours had passed.... &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">This was the longest sleep he had in the past year, so his head felt clearer than ever. &#xA0;Ahn-jaehyun could easily process the various types of joy he felt.</span></p><p><span style="">This was why Ahn-jaehyun was able to savor his own overflowing happiness.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Well, let&apos;s see the effect of the Frost&#x2026; &#xA0;It can pretty much be used on anything.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">The most joyous part was the fast that he had gained the Ancient Power of Frost.</span></p><p><span style="">Basically, the Ancient Power could only be used on Rank A Skills. &#xA0;He couldn&apos;t use it on the Skills he had gained recently. &#xA0;On the other hand, it could be used on the Skills that he used as his main power. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;I guess the the Skeletons would change first. &#xA0;I wonder what kind of effect it would have on them?&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">He had no idea what effect would be applied to them. &#xA0;He just knew it&apos;ll be powerful. &#xA0;He was filled with happiness just from thinking about it. </span></p><p><span style="">However, this wasn&apos;t the end to his good news.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;If I do well on this Frozen Kingdom episode, I can get over 3 million purchases on my paid video.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">In truth, the part he was anticipating the most in the Frozen Kingdom episode was the profit from selling his paid video. </span></p><p><span style="">Before Ahn-jaehyun returned to the past, the Stormhunters guild didn&apos;t broadcast the Frozen Kingdom episode live. &#xA0;The entire episode was filmed, and edited. &#xA0;Then they put the film on their live channel.</span></p><p><span style="">At the time, live broadcasts were considered to be the best way to deliver a content. &#xA0;However, the Stormhunters decided to try a new method. &#xA0;Since it was new, it was risky. &#xA0;However, this attempt lead them to striking gold.</span></p><p><span style="">Of course, they didn&apos;t succeed just because they attempted something new. &#xA0;The Frozen Kingdom episode was played over a 15 day period, yet they edited it down to 3 hours of footage. &#xA0;Moreover, the video wasn&apos;t just done as if it was footage from a game. &#xA0;They planned out the scenario and plot. &#xA0;They produced it like a real movie. &#xA0;In this process, the Stormhunters had hired a famous Hollywood director. &#xA0;They basically created a movie using the Warlord as stage.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;At the time, they had sold an incredible 3.9 million tickets to the paid broadcast.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">It had been a huge success! </span></p><p><span style="">The Frozen Kingdom episode film put out by the Stormhunters didn&apos;t get nominated in the Academy awards or Cannes film festival, but it did gain entrance in some famous film festivals. It received favorable review. &#xA0;This wasn&#x2019;t something one just forgot about after seeing it once. &#xA0;It was accepted as a piece of art.</span></p><p><span style="">Of course, no one had attempted this yet. &#xA0;If one wanted to attempt this, one needed a Main Scenario Quest type story to pull it off. &#xA0;However, no guild had monopolized the Corrupt Count or the Immoral Prince episode. &#xA0;The Hydra guild had attempted to monopolize the Corrupt Count episode, but in the end, they weren&apos;t able to kill the most important figure, the Corrupt Count. &#xA0;This pretty much nullified their attempt at a monopoly of a content. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">It would be possible to make one with the Immoral Prince episode, but any deal needed the Hahoe Mask&apos;s approval.</span></p><p><span style="">This was why Ahn-jaehyun&apos;s attempt at this would be awesome and fresh to the audiences.</span></p><p><span style="">Of course, he was looking forward to this.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;I wonder if the Romani Films would be able to digest this.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">On the other hand, this was a full-length film. &#xA0;This would require a lot more professional editing than a regular movie. &#xA0;It was possible that the Romani film might become overwhelmed by this task.</span></p><p><span style="">Of course, the production cost would skyrocket. &#xA0;He had to expect the cost to be in the range of being able to buy one or two mid-sized sedans.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Whatever.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">However, Ahn-jaehyun had enough money to pay it off in a lump sum.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;It&apos;s been advertised properly. &#xA0;I&apos;ll have to do this even if I have to empty my bank account.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">The Main Scenario Quest&apos;s content had suddenly changed, but on the other hand, Warlord had given out an incredible free advertisement for Hyrkan. &#xA0;Everyone would be anticipating the new footage from the Hahoe Mask. &#xA0;They&apos;ll be curious as to how the Hahoe Mask had opened a new era.</span></p><p><span style="">If he got past this part, he wouldn&apos;t have to spend money on Items.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;There aren&apos;t that many level 200 Items available, and I wouldn&apos;t immediately have to spend money in purchasing those Items.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">In the past, he had to change his Item setting every time he leveled up. &#xA0;Moreover, it wasn&apos;t just about upgrading the Hahoe Mask. &#xA0;He also had to take care of each of his Skeletons too, and he had to figuratively sell his spine to equip them.</span></p><p><span style="">However, this wasn&apos;t the case any more.</span></p><p><span style="">The Ruined Kingdom episode had just started, and the Items above level 200 would start to come out in earnest. &#xA0;These would be Items for the Users that went through the 2nd Advancement. &#xA0;In other words, Ahn-jaehyun didn&apos;t have to purchase any more new Items.</span></p><p><span style="">If he needed to find a place where he needed to spend his money, it would be to equip the Death Knight he&apos;ll be able to summon soon. &#xA0;This would be after he went through the 2nd Advancement to become a Lich. &#xA0;However, it shouldn&#x2019;t cost too much.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;I&apos;ll have to give either the Crying Sword or the Dethrone King&apos;s Sword to the Death Knight.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">The Death Knight was like a Lich&apos;s clone. &#xA0;Basically, any permanent Items that were bound to the summoner could be equipped by the Death Knight. &#xA0;If he wanted to, he could even put a Hahoe Mask on it. &#xA0;Of course, the Death Knight wouldn&apos;t complain about being handed down used Items.</span></p><p><span style="">In the end, that was the most joyous part of all of this. &#xA0;The Hahoe Mask will show the fastest progress starting now from the Ruined Kingdom episode. &#xA0;The difference between the Hahoe Mask and the 30 great guilds would widen further.</span></p><p><span style="">As he brushed his teeth, Ahn-jaehyun saw a rosy future in front of his eyes.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Should I move to a new place?&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">Should he move to an incredible penthouse? &#xA0;It would look over the Han River. &#xA0;Maybe he&apos;ll get the high-rise apartment where he&apos;ll be able to play the game with his V-Gear in front of the view of the Han River.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;&#x2026;&#x2026;No. &#xA0;I have no problem playing this game here. &#xA0;The internet speed is quite fast here. &#xA0;Ah! &#xA0;Maybe I should buy a car?&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">He could fill the parking lot with expensive sports car, and he could take a different car out each day. &#xA0;He thought about diligently playing a game with cool cars in a house with a garage.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;&#x2026;&#x2026;however, there is no point in buying an expensive car right now. &#xA0;I don&apos;t have anywhere I want to go, and I don&apos;t have the time. &#xA0;Moreover, the insurance price would be high. &#xA0;On top of that, the value of a car halves the moment I buy it. &#xA0;So what should I do? &#xA0;There must be a luxury item that I can splurge on right now. &#xA0;What kind of luxury item do I want?&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">In truth, he wasn&apos;t easily able to imagine this incredibly rosy future.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Yes. &#xA0;I&apos;ll use this opportunity to buy the level 6 V-Gear! &#xA0;I wonder what kind of expression the Peach Store employees will have when I buy the level 6 V-Gear with a single payment.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">Ahn-jaehyun could now properly imagine his rosy future. &#xA0;He spat out the liquid through his smile.</span></p><p><span style="">After he washed his face, Ahn-jaehyun put his glasses back on. He was in a good mood as he turned on his Tablet PC.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;I bet it&apos;ll be plastered with stories about me.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">It was at that moment he saw it.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Huh? &#xA0;What? &#xA0;The Stormhunters?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">He had missed an incredible development during the 8 hours he was asleep.</span></p><p>4.</p><p><span style="">It was a monster with a half-translucent body, and it had a red light that was surrounding its body.</span></p><p><span style="">The bastard could spit out endless amount of flame, and it was hot enough to melt anything in its path. &#xA0;When the monster was at a disadvantage, it ascended to the top of the Urugal mountain, which was barren. &#xA0;It was able to avoid any disadvantage by turning the summit into a lake of flame. &#xA0;It also had the unreasonable ability to completely recover from large wounds.</span></p><p><span style="">It also had the most health of any monster that had appeared up until now. &#xA0;When it was angry, no one could take more than three attack from it. &#xA0;It was that strong.</span></p><p><span style="">Blaze Slime Dragon! </span></p><p><span style="">It protected the summit of the Urugal mountain range, and it was a monster amongst monsters with various unreasonable settings.</span></p><p><span style="">The only logical part about this monster was the fact that the Tankers and Strikers could draw its Aggro. &#xA0;Then the Magicians could do the damage dealing... &#xA0;The only way to take it down was using this simple plan. &#xA0;This simple plan that was needed to clear it was the only part that gave comfort to the participants.</span></p><p><span style="">Of course, a marathon was a race where one ran for 42.195km. &#xA0;In concept, it was a very simple sport, but the answer in how to finish it was tough to come up with. </span></p><p><span style="">There was no easy answer to defeating this monster.</span></p><p><span style="">This was why the strongest Users of Warlords, who had played Warlord for a number of years, gave up on this monster. &#xA0;These Users had defeated countless monsters that had been called the strongest, yet they openly abandoned this raid.</span></p><p><span style="">However, this monster had fallen in front of her.</span></p><p><span style="">[You&apos;ve gained the Title &apos;One who Conquered the Urugal Mountain Range.&apos;] </span></p><p><span style="">[You&apos;ve gained the Title &apos;Dragon Slayer.&apos;] </span></p><p><span style="">[You&apos;ve gained the Title &apos;Owner of the Urugal Mountain Range.&apos;] </span></p><p><span style="">Stormhunter Queen Shir. </span></p><p><span style="">Most of her silver armor had melted away from the effect of the Slime Dragon&apos;s Slime Breaths. &#xA0;Even the skin underneath her armor was darkened. &#xA0;Of course, her hair and face was burnt too. &#xA0;She looked unsightly, and one couldn&apos;t even tell, who she was. &#xA0;However, she was alive.</span></p><p><span style="">She was alive as she looked at the Slime Dragon&apos;s end. </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ooh-wah! &#xA0;Ooh-wah!&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">There were only two of them left. &#xA0;Hatch was with her.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;We really caught it! &#xA0;Ooh-wah!&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">In other words, they were the only two survivors.</span></p><p><span style="">Thirty Users had participated in the Blaze Dragon Raid, but their number quickly diminished as time passed. &#xA0;There would be no reattempt after this. &#xA0;The Slime Dragon&apos;s Breath targeted the Priests before they could do anything. &#xA0;Even the Tankers couldn&apos;t survive against its attack.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Queen! &#xA0;We did it!&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Of course, the dead didn&apos;t just stay silent.</span></p><p><span style="">- Hey! &#xA0;Hatch! &#xA0;Hatch! &#xA0;What happened? &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">- Has it ended? </span></p><p><span style="">- Did we really catch it?</span></p><p><span style="">The dead Users were still using the Voice Talk from outside the game to speak to those still in the game.</span></p><p><span style="">Hatch answered them.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;We caught it!&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">At those words, cheer and silence started mixing with each other. &#xA0;The Voice Talk turned into a bedlam. &#xA0;Hatch had to hear all these sounds at once, and it was hellish to experience it.</span></p><p><span style="">However, Hatch enjoyed the situation.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;This is crazy! &#xA0;We did it!&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">They had experienced failing this Raid once, and they also viewed the Raid footage from the other 30 great guilds. &#xA0;With these information, they had come up with a battle strategy, but still it hadn&apos;t been easy.</span></p><p><span style="">No, this was the most difficult Boss Monster that the Stormhunters guild had come across.</span></p><p><span style="">The worst part was the new phase that no other team had reached before. &#xA0;In an instant, the Blaze Slime Dragon had activated a self-destruct attack. &#xA0;It used the Slime Buster.</span></p><p><span style="">As it self-destructed, its body had become a huge bomb, and the fragments flew everywhere.</span></p><p><span style="">The unexpected attack had done an incredible amount of damage. &#xA0;This single attack had instantly killed 11 Users. &#xA0;When they all suffered Game Over, Hatch wondered what dramas we would watch in the next 48 hours. &#xA0;He thought nothing good would come out of this run.</span></p><p><span style="">However, Shir didn&apos;t give up in such a situation. &#xA0;There would be no second chance for her. &#xA0;She immediately drew the aggro of the Slime Dragon, and Hatch became in tune with her movements as he used his magic.</span></p><p><span style="">It felt as if they were throwing eggs at a boulder. &#xA0;They were fighting for the sake of fighting, since they hadn&apos;t died.</span></p><p><span style="">However, the egg had eventually broken the boulder.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Queen!&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Her appearance was unsightly, but at that moment, Shir really looked like the Queen.</span></p><p><span style="">Shir replied when she saw Hatch.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Hatch!&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">When Shir called his name, Hatch had a deep smile on his face as he opened both his arms. &#xA0;In such a scene, didn&apos;t the surviving members suppose to hug each other?</span></p><p><span style="">However, Shir&apos;s hug wasn&apos;t what came towards Hatch.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Do you know what this Ancient Power is?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What? Ancient&#x2026;&#x2026; What did you just say?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;The Ancient Power of Flame&#x2026;&#x2026; A weird reward was added on. &#xA0;Do you know anything about it?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Do you know about it or not?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">At Shir&apos;s question, Hatch felt a need to come up with some answer.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;That is&#x2026;&#x2026; The only Go-dae I know is the university near the Ahn-ahm station.&#x201D; </span> <sub>1</sub></p><p><span style="">At those words, Shir glared at Hatch for a brief moment. &#xA0;Then she started talking to the others through the Voice Talk.</span></p><p>5.</p><p><span style="">[Stormhunters. &#xA0;They succeeded in conquering the summit of the Urugal mountain range!] </span></p><p><span style="">[Storm Queen. &#xA0;She completely washed away her humiliation from the Immoral Prince Raid!] </span></p><p><span style="">[Ancient Power! It is the emergence of Warlord&#x2019;s Skill Enhancement Content!] </span></p><p><span style="">Around half a day ago, Warlord was filled with stories about the Hahoe Mask and the arrival of the 3rd Main Scenario Quest. &#xA0;Now it was filled with news about the Stormhunters.</span></p><p><span style="">Of course, the inside of Hyrkan&apos;s head was filled with stories about the Stormhunters guild.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;She got the Flame.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">Even after he entered the game, he was unable to do anything. &#xA0;He just looked at the Hologram window as he looked over the online articles. &#xA0;He was deep within his thoughts.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;This doesn&apos;t make any sense. &#xA0;The Blaze Slime Dragon was suppose to give an Ancient Rank. &#xA0;Yet she got the Flame?&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">The Stormhunters guild had succeeded in conquering the summit of the Urugal mountain range.</span></p><p><span style="">This fact was surprising in itself. &#xA0;Hyrkan was well aware of how difficult it was to catch the Blaze Slime Dragon. &#xA0;It being difficult was an understatement. &#xA0;First, it was impossible to do anything near it. &#xA0;It didn&apos;t register any parts of its body being severed. &#xA0;It could just turn the surrounding into a lakeof fire to nullify any damage it took from attacks. &#xA0;It was an unreasonable Boss Monster to face.</span></p><p><span style="">The cherry on top was the 3rd phase. &#xA0;If the Users didn&apos;t know about the Slime Buster, everyone in the party was pretty much killed. It was an AOE attack, and it was incredibly powerful. &#xA0;It was an AOE attack on the same tier as the Frost Fog he suffered at the end of his battle with the Frost Knight. &#xA0;It wasn&apos;t something one could avoid. &#xA0;It was an AOE attack where the only solution was to endure it.</span></p><p><span style="">Fortunately, Hyrkan had prior knowledge about these types of attacks, so he was able to plan for it. &#xA0;However, the Stormhunters guild had gone in blind, and they had succeeded.</span></p><p><span style="">Of course, this wasn&apos;t their first attempt. &#xA0;They had pretty much perfected the method to clear the early and mid portion of the Raid, but it was still an incredible accomplishment.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;What is going on?&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">However, the more surprising part about this was the fact the Storm Queen obtained a Mythos Rank Ancient Power. &#xA0;She had the biggest impact on the Blaze Slime Dragon Raid, so she had gained the Flame.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;What changed?&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">If events followed like Hyrkan&apos;s memories, the Ruined Kingdom episode started when one conquered the summit of the Urugal mountain. &#xA0;Afterwards, the Ancient Power content had appeared. &#xA0;However, the Mythos Rank Ancient Power appeared two months after the Blaze Slime Dragon was taken down.</span></p><p><span style="">The Mythos Rank Ancient Power had appeared as a reward for clearing the Frost Knight and the Blaze Slime Dragon.</span></p><p><span style="">Of course, this wasn&apos;t too strange of an occurrence.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Did they change the difficulty of the Quests?&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">According to Tobot Soft, the AI selected the difficulty based on how fast the game was progressing. &#xA0;Moreover, this determination process was so complex that developers wouldn&apos;t be able to change the difficulty on their own. &#xA0;If they changed it, it would cause a System Error.</span></p><p><span style="">Basically, this was the cumulative result of the recent events. &#xA0;This was the answer given by Warlord to match the swift progress shown by the Users.</span></p><p><span style="">In other words, the information he knew wasn&#x2019;t the answer any more. &#xA0;It can only be used as reference material.</span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan closed both his eyes.</span></p><p><span style="">Until a moment ago, he had been so happy in many ways that he couldn&#x2019;t get a handle on his thoughts. &#xA0;However, his head was surprisingly cool right now.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;I have about 43% left before I reach level 200. &#xA0;I don&#x2019;t have the Ifrit&#x2019;s Tears, but if I hunt as I travel towards the Terube castle wall&#x2026;.. &#xA0;I&#x2019;ll be able to reach level 200 in one or two days.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">His cool head had to face up to the reality.</span></p><p><span style="">He wasn&#x2019;t behind, but that didn&#x2019;t mean he was far ahead either.</span></p><p><span style="">He wouldn&#x2019;t be running the race by himself.</span></p><p><span style="">In the end, he had only one thing he could do.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Yes, let&#x2019;s do this. &#xA0;Let&#x2019;s see who gets trampled.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">He had to sprint with all his might to shake off his competitors. &#xA0;This was what Hyrkan had to do.</span></p><p>Translator&apos;s Note</p><p></p><ol><p></p><p></p><li>&#xA0;Go-dae means ancient, but it is also a shorthand way to refer to Goryeo university in Seoul. &#xA0; Goryeo=&gt;Go. &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; University=&gt;Dae-hahk-gyo=&gt;Dae</li><p></p><p></p></ol><p></p>
