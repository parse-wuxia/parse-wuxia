<p>Chapter 157 &#x2013; Heard Fortress (2)</p><p>5.</p><p><span style="">- What should we do? </span></p><p><span style="">Apollo asked the question again, but the answer had already crystallized in Sinclair&apos;s head.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;This is the golden opportunity to catch the Hahoe Mask.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">Hahoe Mask. </span></p><p><span style="">It wasn&apos;t an exaggeration to say the Hahoe Mask was the single most valuable being one could kill in Warlord.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;No. &#xA0;I have to catch him no matter what.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">He had to catch the Hahoe Mask before he became a bigger variable. &#xA0;He had to kill the Hahoe Mask even if it was an unreasonable task.</span></p><p><span style="">However, he was given a chance to catch the Hahoe Mask, so there was no reason why he should turn down this opportunity.</span></p><p><span style="">There was only one problem.</span></p><p><span style="">Would the Big Smiles guild really be able to kill the Hahoe Mask?</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Finally, luck is with me.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">They wouldn&apos;t be able catch the Hahoe Mask.</span></p><p><span style="">The situation was completely different from the time when Sinclair went out to face the Hahoe Mask at the Cursed Castle. &#xA0;At the time, the idea of the Hahoe Mask winning against Sinclair was laughable. &#xA0;His Skeleton Warriors weren&#x2019;t even an annoyance against Sinclair.</span></p><p><span style="">What about the current Hahoe Mask?</span></p><p><span style="">It was useless to compare levels. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">The difference in Item Setting was too large. &#xA0;This was beyond the Hahoe Mask slightly exceeding Sinclair in terms of Item Setting. &#xA0;Currently, no User could come close to the Item Setting possessed by the Hahoe Mask. &#xA0;He had the Deposed Prince&apos;s Sword, Argardo&apos;s Armor, Secret Society&apos;s Token, Corrupted Arbiter&apos;s Ring, Corrupted Destroyer&apos;s Necklace... &#xA0;He was pretty much like an end-game boss.</span></p><p><span style="">What about the Skeletons possessed by the Hahoe Mask?</span></p><p><span style="">A Hahoe Mask fan broke down a battle footage released by the Hahoe Mask. &#xA0;The gear worn by a Skeleton Warrior on average was worth 23,300 gold.</span></p><p><span style="">However, this was an estimate from the time when he faced the Frost Knight. &#xA0;The Hahoe Mask hadn&apos;t released the footage yet, but there was a rumor going around that he had summoned a Death Knight when facing the Skull Collector. &#xA0;The rumor was from a User that had passed through the Voodook&apos;s Tunnel. &#xA0;The Hahoe Mask was much stronger than the time he faced the Frost Knight.</span></p><p><span style="">What would happen if the Big Smiles guild tried to hunt him down? &#xA0;If this was a regular hunting ground, they would have a chance of winning. &#xA0;However, this was the Black Continent. &#xA0;If one moved a large group of Users, it would just lead to a war of attrition with the Monsters.</span></p><p><span style="">Even with all these factors against them, Sinclair thought they would be able to catch the Hahoe Mask if luck was with them.</span></p><p><span style="">The reason being...</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;It is fortunate that the Clover Unit is nearby.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">The Poker team had pulled V&amp;V guild into the ranks of the top guilds. &#xA0;One of the Poker team called the Clover unit was heading toward the Heard Fortress.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Apollo&apos;s exploration team and the Clover unit can merge. &#xA0;There would be a total of 40 Users. &#xA0;Apollo&apos;s team can be used as bait, then the Clover unit can step forward&#x2026;&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">He trusted the Clover team. &#xA0;Sinclair&apos;s backers was the Hands guild, and they had put in a considerable effort in making the Clover unit.</span></p><p><span style="">At that moment, Sinclair thought about the final worry he had.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;The Hahoe Mask and the Stormhunters guild must not meet. &#xA0;We have to prevent the two of them from teaming up at all cost.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">He worried about the worst possible outcome. &#xA0;After he worried about the possibility, Sinclair finally opened his mouth.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Apollo.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">- Yes. </span></p><p><span style="">Sinclair&#x2019;s answer was late, since he had thought over his options. &#xA0;However, Apollo didn&apos;t act impatient with Sinclair.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Let&apos;s kill him. &#xA0;Let&apos;s use this opportunity to kill him.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">- The Hahoe Mask?</span></p><p><span style="">Apollo seemed slightly surprised, so Sinclair immediately forged ahead with his words.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;It&apos;ll be possible if you cooperate with one of the Poker team. &#xA0;The V&amp;V guild&apos;s Poker team is nearby you.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">- I&apos;ll do as you say.</span></p><p><span style="">His reaction couldn&apos;t be seen, but Apollo had a big smile on his face at Sinclair&apos;s answer. &#xA0;The flesh on his face bunched up together as he smiled.</span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan&apos;s secret weapons were beyond his expectation. &#xA0;They were great. &#xA0;The Mini Ogre Skeleton Warriors chased down the swift runaway Users, and they tormented the Users that were caught.</span></p><p><span style="">When their ankles were caught by the Mini Ogre Skeleton Warriors, the Hahoe Mask appeared, and the User would give up on running away.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Fight me! &#xA0;Fuck. &#xA0;Let&apos;s see who&apos;ll win!&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">These Users had played the game of Warlord for several years, and they had experienced the ups and downs of this game. &#xA0;The Users struggled fiercely against Hyrkan, and they showed a fiery spirit.</span></p><p><span style="">Of course, their fiery spirit was useless against Hyrkan&apos;s summoned Skeleton Warriors and Knights. &#xA0;It was a pointless struggle.</span></p><p><span style="">He was a frightening predator.</span></p><p><span style="">This was the moment when a new mask appeared behind Hyrkan&apos;s current mask.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Whoa.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;As expected of the 30 great guilds, they use expensive Items.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">Of course, it didn&apos;t take long for this frightening predator to morph into a hyena that roamed around to find rotten meat. &#xA0;Hyrkan searched the bodies of the dead Users.</span></p><p><span style="">In Warlord, consumable Items had to be carried around on one&#x2019;s body. &#xA0;Of course, when a User suffered a Game Over, the consumable Items on one&apos;s body fell to the floor. &#xA0;Even when one revived 48 hours later, the consumable Items weren&apos;t restored to the User. &#xA0;Only the stored Items inside the wristwatch was retained.</span></p><p><span style="">Normally, the consumable Items were treated as trash Items in PK. &#xA0;Everyone focused on the wristwatches. &#xA0;Hyrkan also followed this behavior.</span></p><p><span style="">However, it was a different story on the Black Continent.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;These hunts feels different.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">Instead of the wristwatches, Hyrkan was taking the consumable Items first. &#xA0;He smiled when he noticed this.</span></p><p><span style="">Of course, Hyrkan also took the wristwatches.</span></p><p><span style="">Puhk, puhk! </span></p><p><span style="">The sword he held came down on the wrists of the Users, and he took their wristwatches.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;The Deposed Prince&apos;s Sword is awesome. &#xA0;It is great for dicing.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">Deposed Prince&apos;s Sword.... &#xA0;It was a masterpiece forged by the Blacksmith Olf. &#xA0;It was given to heroes, who had defeated the Immoral Prince. &#xA0;It was meant to be used to save the world. &#xA0;If Blacksmith Olf saw his sword being praised for being a good butcher&#x2019;s knife, Hyrkan&apos;s stomach would be struck repeatedly by &apos;Olf&apos;s Hammer.&apos;</span></p><p><span style="">Of course, Blacksmith Olf wasn&apos;t here now, so he didn&apos;t have to worry about such a scenario.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Ok.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan had a smile as he looked at his full pouch. &#xA0;It was as if a hamster had stuffed its food into its cheek. &#xA0;This was one of the happiest smiles he had put on in the Black Continent.</span></p><p><span style="">However, the smile didn&apos;t last long. </span></p><p><span style="">Koo-uh-uh! </span></p><p><span style="">When the Users disappeared, the monsters showed up to torment Hyrkan.</span></p><p><span style="">The role of pursuer and the pursued flipped constantly in this hunting ground. &#xA0;However, Hyrkan didn&apos;t plan on bypassing these monsters.</span></p><p><span style="">Of course, the riled up monsters drew aggro from the only User left alive!</span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan smiled as he saw the monsters run towards him without reserve.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;This really is a fucked up game.&#x2019;</span></p><p>6.</p><p><span style="">Ahn-jaehyun&apos;s eyes were open as he lay on his worn mattress. &#xA0;He kept staring at the old wallpaper on his ceiling.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Ah, I want to move to a different place.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">Recently, this phrase was never far from his mouth. &#xA0;After getting up, Ahn-jaehyun put on his cheap horn rimmed glasses. &#xA0;He reflexively turned on the Tablet PC that had been placed next to his glasses. &#xA0;However, it felt as if his Tablet PC was more sluggish than normal. &#xA0;He might be mistaken, but Ahn-jaehyun&apos;s expression turned sullen.</span></p><p><span style="">In the end, a sigh came out from his mouth.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;I can&apos;t believe I&apos;ve reached this point.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">Money. </span></p><p><span style="">The thing he had wanted the most was now in plenty supply. &#xA0;It was beyond plenty. &#xA0;He was overflowing with money.</span></p><p><span style="">However, he didn&apos;t have the free time to spend his money. &#xA0;His days were scheduled into blocks, and he had to be constantly inside the game. &#xA0;He didn&apos;t have the time to eat out or even order food.</span></p><p><span style="">In recent days, he was nervous most of the time as he went through his busy schedule. &#xA0;He had built up his tower through hard work, yet he was afraid a momentary mistake would make it the Leaning Tower of Pisa. &#xA0;He had to keep his schedule.</span></p><p><span style="">Maybe that was the reason?</span></p><p><span style="">Ahn-jaehyun was getting new influx of money from his paid videos and other miscellaneous earnings, yet it didn&apos;t feel like his own money.</span></p><p><span style="">Maybe, if he was able to recklessly spend his money on the Items within the game, he might have felt differently. &#xA0;However, he hadn&apos;t done that.</span></p><p><span style="">This was why he unconsciously turned away from the numbers that had excited him to no end before. &#xA0;He started searching for Warlord-related articles instead of looking at his his bank account.</span></p><p><span style="">The search words mainly focused on 5 guilds including V&amp;V and Big Smiles guild.</span></p><p><span style="">His search turned out a lot of information.</span></p><p><span style="">The V&amp;V, Big Smiles, Sweepers, Wul-gwahng and Blossoms guild were explicitly showing their desire to monopolize the Black Continent. &#xA0;The Black Continent was the stage of the Ruined Kingdom episode, so this became a hot issue. &#xA0;A hot issue always created a lot of content online.</span></p><p><span style="">As he went through the related articles, Ahn-jaehyun clicked his tongue.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Well, they obtained several ace cards they could use to attempt the monopoly. This could bring change to the final outcome.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">The topic that brought the most bitterness to Ahn-jaehyun&apos;s mouth was the accomplishments of the Poker team. &#xA0;They were the V&amp;V guild&apos;s strongest force.</span></p><p><span style="">He read the articles related to the Poker team, and he watched the battle footage they had released in the Black Continent. &#xA0;He let out a bitter sneer.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;I thought these bastards planned on breaking all the record times for the Raids.....&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">Until the Stormhunters guild caught the Blaze Slime Dragon, the Poker team was still systematically attacking the record time for the Raids. &#xA0;They centered their core contents around this concepts.</span></p><p><span style="">However, they were suddenly operating out of the Black Continent now.</span></p><p><span style="">In truth, this should be taken lightly by Ahn-jaehyun.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;It is quite impressive.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">The 30 great guilds were able to move massive amount of money through the live channels. &#xA0;This wasn&apos;t all their money. &#xA0;There were backers and investors. &#xA0;There were a lot of other people&apos;s money sunk into their venture. &#xA0;Since the money didn&apos;t belong to them, they couldn&apos;t easily change directions.</span></p><p><span style="">However, the V&amp;V guild had executed this change too easily. &#xA0;This was something he should be worried about.</span></p><p><span style="">In the end, the V&amp;V guild would be on the opposite side of Ahn-jaehyun. &#xA0;They would never help him.</span></p><p><span style="">Recently, the Stormhunters guild was being quiet, but they had stepped onto the Black Continent first. &#xA0;They could suddenly become a variable that could torment Ahn-jaehyun in the future.</span></p><p><span style="">Ahn-jaehyun took off his glasses, and he covered his face with his two hands.</span></p><p><span style="">There was only one solution to this problem.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;If they catch my tail, it is the end of me.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">He had to change this competition into a race.</span></p><p><span style="">He had to change it into a game where the person in first place was the victor. &#xA0;It didn&apos;t matter if there were several hundred or several thousand Users behind him. &#xA0;He had to make it so that there would be only one User that could reach first place.</span></p><p><span style="">After taking away his hands from his face, Ahn-jaehyun put on his glasses as he got up from his seat. &#xA0;Ahn-jaehyun went to a sink nearby. &#xA0;The kitchen sink was worn and rusted. &#xA0;However, there was a high quality coffee machine atop the sink. &#xA0;It gave off an elegant atmosphere. </span></p><p><span style="">He had recently purchased this pod coffee machine. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">He had spent a good amount of money to purchase this one. &#xA0;This machine brought home the fact that he had made a lot of money recently.</span></p><p><span style="">Moreover, this machine was worth its cost. &#xA0;He placed his stained coffee cup on the machine as &#xA0;he put in the classy-looking pod. &#xA0;Unlike his old acidic coffee, the new coffee was fragrant.</span></p><p><span style="">Still, Ahn-jaehyun dropped the oft used grape flavored candies into the coffee.</span></p><p><span style="">Afterwards, he brought the coffee to his mouth, and he nodded his head.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Mmm. &#xA0;It&apos;s good.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;I feel like a New Yorker. &#xA0;I&apos;m glad I bought it.&#x2019;</span></p><p>7.</p><p><span style="">Ravine. </span></p><p><span style="">There were enormous cliffs facing each other, and there was a forest in front of the ravine. &#xA0;Large stone pillars arose from between the forest, and there were remains of large buildings besides the pillars. &#xA0;Moreover, one could faintly see that a fortress had blocked the entry into the ravine in the past.</span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan had saw this from far away, and he let out a big sigh.</span></p><p><span style="">As Hyrkan started breathing normally again, one could see 19 Skeleton Warriors and two Skeleton Knights lined up behind him. &#xA0;They were in their combat-ready stance. &#xA0;One could already see traces of battle on them, and it meant that a battle had been performed not too long ago. &#xA0;Moreover, it was a sign that more battles was in the near future.</span></p><p><span style="">This was why Hyrkan treasured this time where he would be able to take a brief breather.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;As expected, things have change from what I know.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan searched through his memories, and he thought about the first base that had been formed in the Black Continent.</span></p><p><span style="">Before he came to the past, the first base hadn&apos;t been located at a ravine. &#xA0;It had centered around a lake with black water.</span></p><p><span style="">The name wasn&apos;t the only thing that had changed. &#xA0;Basically, the stage itself had changed.</span></p><p><span style="">He had held out hope that only the name had changed. &#xA0;Now he decisively quashed such sentiments.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Still, it feels as if I have seen this before&#xB7;&#xB7;&#xB7;&#xB7;&#xB7;&#xB7;.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">At that moment, he was looking at a stage that was different from what he remembered, but he kept having a sense of deja vu. &#xA0;He tilted his head in confusion.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;An enormous ravine&#xB7;&#xB7;&#xB7;&#xB7;&#xB7;&#xB7; Which location had a ravine as its stage?&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">However, he wasn&apos;t given time to ruminate over his worries. &#xA0;His break didn&apos;t last long either.</span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan turned to look over his back.</span></p><p><span style="">Koo-uh-uh! </span></p><p><span style="">It was as if the monsters were letting out a roar for courtesy&apos;s sake. &#xA0;The sound coaxed Hyrkan to move forward.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;I have to avoid being in 2nd place.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">He had to avoid being in 2nd place at all cost. &#xA0;Before he could fully catch his breath, Hyrkan headed towards the Ruin of the Heard Fortress.</span></p><p>8.</p><p><span style="">[You&apos;ve entered the Ruins of the Heard Fortress.] </span></p><p><span style="">[You&apos;ve gained the Title &apos;Heard Fortress Excavator.&apos;] </span></p><p><span style="">[You&apos;ve gained the Title &apos;Explorer of the Ruined Kingdom.&apos;] </span></p><p><span style="">[You&apos;ve gained the Title &apos;First Discoverer.&apos;] </span></p><p><span style="">The Heard Fortress was in a terrible state. &#xA0;However, Hyrkan was given an awe-inspiring gift for being the first visitor.</span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan was finally able to smile when he received the Titles.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;I avoided being in 2nd place.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">He had worried about the possibility of other Users coming here first. &#xA0;His worry melted away.</span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan immediately checked the fruits of his labor.</span></p><p><span style="">[Heard Fortress Excavator] </span></p><p><span style="">Title Effect : All Stats +15 </span></p><p><span style="">[Explorer of the Ruined Kingdom] </span></p><p><span style="">Title Effect : Magic Power +20 </span></p><p><span style="">[First Discoverer] </span></p><p><span style="">Title Effect : Stamina +40, Magic Power +40 </span></p><p><span style="">The Title Options were fantastic. Hyrkan glanced at his Stats Window after the Titles Effects were applied.</span></p><p><span style="">However, he didn&apos;t sentimentalize over it. &#xA0;After he checked the rough estimates of his Stats, he immediately put the Wooden Conch to his ears. &#xA0;This wasn&apos;t the end. &#xA0;He wanted the real treasure. &#xA0;This wasn&apos;t the true reward given to the 1st place winner.</span></p><p><span style="">- Find our flag. &#xA0;Our flag.....</span></p><p><span style="">The Wooden Conch once again pointed out the next path to Hyrkan. &#xA0;Hyrkan turned his head to look at his surrounding.</span></p><p><span style="">He searched his surrounding with the eyes of a hawk. Suddenly, Hyrkan&apos;s eyes went out of focus for a little bit. &#xA0;He had been earnestly searching around his surrounding, but now his head was tilted in puzzlement.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;I&apos;m pretty sure I&apos;ve seen this somewhere.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">Deja vu.</span></p><p><span style="">Something was bothering Hyrkan once again.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;I&apos;m pretty sure I&apos;ve seen this place somewhere. &#xA0;I&apos;m sure I saw it in a footage regarding the Ruined Kingdom Episode.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">However, Hyrkan&apos;s questions disappeared when he saw a mound made out of rocks. &#xA0;The mound was as big as a farmhouse. &#xA0;Moreover, there was flag sticking out at the top.... &#xA0;The flag itself was decayed, and only the pole remained. &#xA0;&#xA0;Hyrkan rejoiced when he saw it. &#xA0;There was no sense of deja vu when he saw it.</span></p><p><span style="">When he was near the stone grave, Hyrkan once again placed the Wooden Conch to his ears. &#xA0;However, the Wooden Conch didn&apos;t emit any sound. &#xA0;It basically meant the Wooden Conch had served its purpose. &#xA0;He threw the Wooden Conch over his shoulder.</span></p><p><span style="">Afterwards, Hyrkan unsheathed the sword on his waist to unearth the stone grave. &#xA0;His Strength Stat was so high that most rocks flew away like pebbles.</span></p><p><span style="">Choo-roong, choo-roong!</span></p><p><span style="">When he came across a large boulder, he used the Crying Sword to break it apart.</span></p><p><span style="">It was a grave meant for someone or something. &#xA0;However, Hyrkan didn&apos;t hesitate in becoming a grave robber.</span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan continued to dig through the stone grave, and he finally found a black box that was hidden below the stone grave.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;It is the Black Treasure Box. &#xA0;As expected, it is a Transcendent Rank.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan used his sword to open the Black Treasure Box. &#xA0;It was as if the Items within the box had escaped the ravages of time. &#xA0;He saw three intact scrolls.</span></p><p><span style="">This was the ultimate reward given to the first person to arrive here.</span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan picked up one of the Scrolls, and he untied the red string.</span></p><p><span style="">[Will you release the Ancient Power?] </span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan immediately made his choice when he heard the System Announcement. &#xA0;Hyrkan didn&apos;t hesitate. </span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Of course, I&#xB7;&#xB7;&#xB7;&#xB7;&#xB7;&#xB7;.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">It happened at that moment.</span></p><p><span style="">[The sleeping souls within the Heard Fortress is waking up.] </span></p><p><span style="">The new System Announcement made Hyrkan pay sharp attention to his surrounding. &#xA0;He couldn&apos;t feel any big disturbance. If one watched the movie, Indiana Jones, didn&apos;t Harrison Ford face immediate danger when he found the treasure he had been searching for?</span></p><p><span style="">This was to be expected.</span></p><p><span style="">This was a natural order of events. &#xA0;He had to do this if he wanted to make the Heard Fortress into a base within the Black Continent. &#xA0;He had to face the Boss Monster that was protecting the Ruins of the Heard Fortress.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Whoever it is, come at me!&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">The System was polite in giving the identity of Hyrkan&apos;s enemy.</span></p><p><span style="">[Anugas is awakening. &#xA0;He is a giant that eats the sleeping souls within the Heard Fortress.] </span></p><p><span style="">[The Quest &apos;Recapture the Heard Fortress!&#x2019; has started.] </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Huh?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">When he heard the announcement, Hyrkan&apos;s mind blanked out. &#xA0;From a short distance away, there was an earthquake, and the ground started to split open. &#xA0;A one-eyed giant with four arms appeared.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Fuck!&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan finally knew where this place was.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;This is the Bizult&apos;s Ravine! This is Bizult&apos;s Ravine where the Anugas appears!&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan finally realized the reason behind the sense of deja vu he had felt.</span></p><p>9.</p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Hahoe Mask. &#xA0;That asshole is really fast.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">Apollo&#x2019;s mission was changed from exploration of the Heard Fortress to finding the Hahoe Mask. &#xA0;Every time he received a report Apollo shook his head.</span></p><p><span style="">This stage was overflowing with monsters, yet the Hahoe Mask was showing incredible hunting speed. &#xA0;Moreover, his swift hunting speed allowed him to travel at a rapid pace. &#xA0;In truth, there was a small voice inside his heart that had acknowledged this premise. &#xA0;The premise being it was impossible to chase down the Hahoe Mask....</span></p><p><span style="">At that moment....</span></p><p><span style="">The fact that a small portion of his heart had already accepted this as fact made him feel rage and irritation. &#xA0;It was ripping his insides apart.</span></p><p><span style="">At that moment, he received another report.</span></p><p><span style="">- We&apos;ve found the Hahoe Mask! </span></p><p><span style="">The hunting party that was tracking the Hahoe Mask alerted Apollo. &#xA0;The Hahoe Mask had just appeared. &#xA0;Apollo asked in delight.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Where is he?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">- The location.... &#xA0;&#xA0;Anyways, the Hahoe Mask just changed direction from his original path. &#xA0;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;So what?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">- It seems he is running away from something.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Is he being chased by a monster?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">- I don&apos;t see any monsters chasing after him.</span></p><p><span style="">When Apollo heard those words, he gave his orders.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Do everything you can to block him! &#xA0;Even if you have to put your life on the line, don&apos;t let him run away! &#xA0;You have impede his progress no matter what!&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">- Yes. </span></p><p><span style="">His subordinate gave an immediate answer, yet Apollo hadn&apos;t heard his answer. &#xA0;He had changed the Voice Talk channel before he heard the answer.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Clover unit. &#xA0;Clover unit. &#xA0;This is Big Smiles. &#xA0;We&apos;ve found the Hahoe Mask. &#xA0;We&apos;ll buy you some time. &#xA0;He is located at....&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">- &#xA0;This is the Clover unit. &#xA0;We&apos;ll be moving towards the location you mentioned.</span></p><p><span style="">The conversation was short. &#xA0;When it ended, Apollo had a triumphant smile on his face.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;This will be your funeral, Hahoe Mask.&#x2019;</span></p>
