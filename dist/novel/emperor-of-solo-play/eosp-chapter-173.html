<p>Chapter 173 &#x2013; Bone Dragon (3)</p><p>8.</p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Let&apos;s see....&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">Ahn-jaehyun, who had been looking at his Tablet PC, repositioned the glasses on his face. &#xA0;Then he started flicking his finger on the Tablet PC.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I spent 3,223 gold for magic recovery Items, 2,550 gold for health recovery Items, and 10,000 gold for Bone Ingredients....&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">He already had a rough estimate on how much he had spent, but the calculation was concluded faster than expected. &#xA0;The final total hadn&apos;t come out yet, but Ahn-jaehyun stopped moving his finger.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ah.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">In the end a very soft and spiritless sigh came out of his mouth. &#xA0;It was a wretched sound.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;This is driving me nuts.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">He was having a hard time letting out a sigh. &#xA0;Afterwards, the words he was about to say got stuck in the back of his throat. &#xA0;Ahn-jaehyun could only complain and moan about his problems with a small voice inside his head.</span></p><p><span style="">In the end, his fermenting discontent led to annoyance.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Bone Dragon... &#xA0;How can they only made such expensive Skills?&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">It had been 10 days since the Hahoe Mask hunted inside the Highwood Forest, which was under Big Smiles&apos; management.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;It isn&apos;t as if I could abstain from using it, since I have to increase the Skill Rank... &#xA0;I caught so many Wood Devils, yet I came out at a loss.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">For the past 10 days, the Hahoe Mask&apos;s hunt to level up had proceeded very smoothly. &#xA0;It wasn&#x2019;t just smooth. &#xA0;He had worked at peak efficiency. &#xA0;In 10 days, he had raised 4 levels, and he had reached Level 235. &#xA0;Before he returned to the past, Hyrkan had worked with the Hahoe Mask guild to level up. &#xA0;It took them 31 days for him to go from Level 230 to Level 240. &#xA0;His current Level Up speed was ridiculous.</span></p><p><span style="">However, the drain on his money was as fast as his Level Up speed.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Shit. &#xA0;Was this Skill really made with the intention of Users using it?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Of course, the main culprit of his loss was the Bone Dragon Skill.</span></p><p><span style="">In their own ways, the Skeletons under the Hahoe Mask was great at eating money, but the Bone Dragon Skill was on a whole different level compared to the Skeletons. &#xA0;He had to dress, decorate and feed the Skeletons. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">It felt like pouring water into a jug with a hole at the bottom. &#xA0;The Bone Dragon Skill made him feel as if he was pouring the water straight onto the floor.</span></p><p><span style="">The scarier part was the fact that he hadn&apos;t really even started using this Skill yet.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;The current level 200 Dragon Type Boss Monster is called the Crypt Dragon. &#xA0;If I wanted Bone Ingredients equal to a whole Dragon... &#xA0;Seventy thousand gold.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">This was the real deal.</span></p><p><span style="">When one went over Level 200 mark to find a large Dragon Type Boss Monster, the price jumped up to a whole different level. &#xA0;This was especially true for the Dragon Type Boss Monsters that were in the large category. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">On the high side, the Skill could require around 100 Bone Ingredients. &#xA0;Of course, the price to gather such a high number of Ingredient Coins was exorbitant.</span></p><p><span style="">Moreover, the Bone Ingredients one paid for an exorbitant price dissipated when the battle ended. &#xA0;When he thought about it, his body shook.</span></p><p><span style="">After his body stopped shaking, Ahn-jaehyun decided to stop worrying about it.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;First, let me worry about increasing the Skill Rank. &#xA0;The terrifying problem of.... &#xA0;Let&apos;s ignore it for now.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">If he worried about it right now, it would only lead to a stomach ulcer.</span></p><p><span style="">Ahn-jaehyun once again started to tap at the Tablet PC&apos;s screen. &#xA0;He restarted the calculation he had stopped a moment ago.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;If I want to buy additional Consumable Items, and the Ingredients for the Bone Dragon.... &#xA0;&#xA0;I&apos;ll have to &#xA0;purchase around 100,000 gold. &#xA0;I&apos;m spending my gold much faster than expected. &#xA0;I purchased 100,000 gold not too long ago.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">Then he started to worry once again.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;The transaction fee involved in swapping 100,000 gold... &#xA0;It&apos;ll be higher than what I spend on food each month.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#xB7;&#xB7;&#xB7;&#xB7;&#xB7;&#xB7;Uh-whew.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">At that moment, Ahn-jaehyun gave up on his calculations.</span></p><p>9.</p><p><span style="">The Bone Wyvern flapped its wing as it landed at the Heard Fortress ruin town&apos;s main square. &#xA0;Its wings was made out of bones, so it didn&apos;t cause the winds to stir. &#xA0;The Bone Wyvern was pretty large, but the landing process was quieter than expected. &#xA0;However, the commotion it caused in its surrounding wasn&apos;t quiet at all.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What the hell is that?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Is it a NPC?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;The Wyvern Delivery NPC possesses a Bone Dragon too? &#xA0;Doesn&apos;t it normally use 5 normal Wyverns?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">The Users in the square caused a large commotion, and it caused the other Users to gather. &#xA0;They came to see what the fuss was about. &#xA0;When the Users were about to converge into a mass resembling a cloud, a User on descended from the back of the Bone Wyvern. This user used the Bone Wyvern&apos;s bones as handholds. &#xA0;The User was wearing pouches and bags, which were filled to bursting, like clothes. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">When the crowd recognized the User&apos;s face, it created a ripple within the crowd.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hahoe Mask?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">The restless energy within the crowd was akin to when a celebrity exited an expensive sports car. &#xA0;As the crowd became excited, Hyrkan&apos;s shoulders were pulled back in pride.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Yes, this is what it is all about.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">In a short amount of time, Hyrkan had used the Bone Wyvern&apos;s Riding Skill to fly from the Highwood Forest to the Heard Fortress ruin town. &#xA0;Moreover, this was the first time the crowd had seen a User use a Bone Wyvern as a mode of transportation.</span></p><p><span style="">This was obvious, but Hyrkan had expected such a reaction.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;As expected, a man is all about the car.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">He had worried about the Riding Skill, but the Bone Dragon flew pretty well in the air. &#xA0;It was impossible to do any tricks in the air, but it was much better than the Wyvern Golem made using the Clay Play Skill. &#xA0;It could fly much higher, and it was a much safer ride.</span></p><p><span style="">Of course, it was a great mode of transportation, but a high cost came with this convenience.</span></p><p><span style="">[The Bone Wyvern has returned to the earth.] </span></p><p><span style="">Accompanying the System Announcement, the Bone Dragon collapsed into a white pile of dust. &#xA0;The dust from the bone was so fine that a small breeze, which couldn&apos;t be felt by the Users, scattered it into the surrounding.</span></p><p><span style="">The strength that had kept Hyrkan&apos;s shoulder and neck tense also dissipated.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Ah, my 200 gold...&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">When the Riding Skill was used to travel a long distance, the Bone Dragon disappeared as soon as one arrived at the destination. &#xA0;Basically, it meant the long distance travel using the Bone Dragon Skill was a one-off Skill. &#xA0;It wasn&apos;t even a round trip. &#xA0;It travelled only one way.</span></p><p><span style="">Thankfully, he could use the lowest flight-capable Dragon Type monster. &#xA0;It was a level 90 normal Wyvern. &#xA0;This was why he only burned 200 golds on this flight.</span></p><p><span style="">Of course, he said it was merely 200 gold, but if he converted to real money, it was the price of an airplane ticket.</span></p><p><span style="">This was why his back look strangely bleak as he head towards the Item Storage center.</span></p><p>10.</p><p><span style="">At the Item Storage center, a room was provided, so a User could always change one&apos;s Item Setting in privacy. &#xA0;It was there as a considerate gesture for the Users. &#xA0;It allowed one to put Items into the Slots, and when one yelled for the Slot On of the Items, one could see how one looked liked. &#xA0;Of course, one would look silly if one kept yelling out Slot On deep within a forest just to check how one looked in an equipment. &#xA0;This was why this room was provided.</span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan was within such a room with his equipments off. &#xA0;He was standing inside wearing only his underwear, and the his body looked bizarre.</span></p><p><span style="">It was reminiscent of the Frankenstein. &#xA0;His arms and legs looked like it was patched together, and tattoos covered his whole body.</span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan grabbed the flesh of his left side like a handle. &#xA0;When he pulled on his skin, the flesh around his stomach opened up like a door. &#xA0;It revealed a six-sided space that was akin to the inside of a safe.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;I&apos;ll put the health recovery Items and Buff Items inside my stomach.....&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan stacked the consumables he had bought into his stomach. &#xA0;He kept putting in Items &#xA0;until there was no available space.</span></p><p><span style="">Then he moved on to his thighs.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;The left will hold the Skeleton Fragments, Bone Explosives, Bone Spear... &#xA0;&#xA0;The other side will hold the offerings for the Bone Dragon.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">He opened his right thigh first then he opened the left. &#xA0;He put Items into the available space. &#xA0;Afterwards, he meticulously put in Items into his arms and even his palms. It was as if he was replacing his bones with Items.</span></p><p><span style="">After finishing his work, he manipulated his wristwatch. &#xA0;It took only 2 seconds for his bare body to be equipped with heavy armor.</span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan&apos;s work wasn&apos;t done yet. &#xA0;There were Item storage pouches placed in various location of the Dark Spot set, and he started filling them with consumable Items.</span></p><p><span style="">He also filled his bag and pockets.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hoo-ooh.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan could breathe easily only after he had finished his work... &#xA0;This task had taken him 20 minutes.</span></p><p><span style="">After he let out a sigh, a bitter smile hung around Hyrkan&apos;s lips.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;I paved the road in front of me with money.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">Every User thoroughly prepared for a hunt and quest by purchasing consumable Items. &#xA0;However, there was no other Users that was as thorough in his preparation in regards to consumable Items like Hyrkan. &#xA0;Hyrkan&apos;s preparation was meticulous, and the consumable Items he used were overly expensive.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Currently, I&apos;m probably the most expensive being walking inside Warlord.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">Just the cost of the Items on his body could be measured in the hundred thousands.</span></p><p><span style="">It didn&apos;t end there. &#xA0;None of Hyrkan&apos;s Items present in his slots were cheap Items.</span></p><p><span style="">Moreover, He possessed Unique Items that most of Warlord didn&apos;t have like the Circlet of Purification and Anugas&apos; Necklace. &#xA0;On top of it all, a good number of his main Items were bound, and he wouldn&apos;t lose any of them if he had his wristwatch stolen. &#xA0;On the other hand, this meant that if someone did manage to steal Hyrkan&apos;s wristwatch, the probability of the Circlet of Purification and the Anugas&apos; Necklace dropping was high. </span></p><p><span style="">It was as Hyrkan had said. &#xA0;It wouldn&apos;t be an exaggeration to say that the most valuable character one could catch in Warlord was Hyrkan.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;I&apos;m such a tempting target, yet the Big Smiles is leaving me alone. &#xA0;It doesn&apos;t make any sense.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">The Big Smiles guild had left Hyrkan alone.</span></p><p><span style="">From time he started hunting inside the Highwood Forest, he had been curious about their absence.</span></p><p><span style="">In truth, Hyrkan hadn&apos;t planned on hunting for 10 days within the Highwood Forest. &#xA0;If he could do it, it would have been great. &#xA0;However, he had thought the Big Smiles guild wouldn&apos;t allow him to hunt in an important region under their control. &#xA0;He had been sure that the Big Smiles would &#xA0;have mobilized their forces to interfere with Hyrkan&apos;s hunt.</span></p><p><span style="">This was why he had been bold and visible in the beginning. &#xA0;He started earnestly hunting down the monsters in plain sight. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">The Hahoe Mask displayed his full might as if he was advertising himself, and from the Big Smiles guild&apos;s perspective, they would have to make thorough preparations to hunt down the Hahoe Mask. &#xA0;Naturally, this preparation would take time, and it would have given the Hahoe Mask the time to hunt a little bit longer.</span></p><p><span style="">This was why he allocated 3 days for his hunt.</span></p><p><span style="">He would hunt for 3 days within the Highwood Forest, and when the Big Smiles guild interferes within him, he would give up the hunt. &#xA0;He would have crossed over into the Red Desert.</span></p><p><span style="">However, the opposite of his expectation occurred. &#xA0;The Big Smiles guild didn&apos;t even sniff near Hyrkan. &#xA0;They didn&apos;t show any indication that they will attempt to catch him. &#xA0;As time passed, Hahoe Mask&apos;s exploits and activities increased. &#xA0;The ridicule and criticism against the Big Smiles were getting louder. &#xA0;However, they treated Hyrkan as if he didn&apos;t exist.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;This course of action worries me more.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">If it came to it, he was ready to fight the Big Smiles guild. &#xA0;However, when the Big Smiles guild stayed silent, it frightened him. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">However, it was also the reason why he had firmed his resolve.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;These guys aren&apos;t the kinds of bastards that would stay put doing nothing.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">When the calm before the storm was long, the destructive power of the storm was stronger.</span></p><p><span style="">There was no need for him to overstay his welcome at the Highwood Forest. &#xA0;There was no reason why he should stay until he triggered a trap laid out by the vindictive Users of the Big Smiles guild.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Well, if I go into the Red Desert, I don&apos;t have to worry about facing the Big Smiles for a while.....&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">Since he had tweaked the nose of the Big Smiles guild, he had to go to the Red Desert as soon as possible.</span></p><p><span style="">The Red Desert was north of the Highwood forest, and it was a region officially given up by the Big Smiles guild. &#xA0;They didn&apos;t hunt, manage, and search inside the Red Desert. &#xA0;It wasn&#x2019;t just the Big Smiles guild. &#xA0;All of the Five Stars guild had given up searching the Red Desert.</span></p><p><span style="">It was a highly dangerous region. &#xA0;It wasn&apos;t even known what types of monsters appeared inside this region. &#xA0;There were no information on what characteristics these monsters possessed.</span></p><p><span style="">The only thing confirmed was the fact that it was more difficult than the Highwood Forest! &#xA0;It was assumed to be a level 250 hunting ground.</span></p><p><span style="">Of course, the Red Desert was filled with more dangerous beings than the mediocre members of the Big Smiles guild.</span></p><p><span style="">Moreover, Hyrkan would have to meet a Warlord NPC known to be very unfriendly towards the &#xA0;Users. &#xA0;The Blacksmith Olf did whatever the hell it wanted, and he had no clues on its location. &#xA0;He just knew the NPC was somewhere inside the Red Desert. &#xA0;He had to find the NPC with just this information.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;If I could end this game, I really would just end it.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">It was a pipe dream, so Hyrkan&apos;s mind boggled at the thought. &#xA0;He fixed the Hahoe Mask on his face.</span></p><p>11.</p><p><span style="">&#x201C;If things continue this way, wouldn&apos;t we become a laughing stock?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">At Heh-bibin&apos;s words, Apollo didn&apos;t move his pouting lips. &#xA0;Heh-bibin spoke to him again. </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;In all fairness, you are the master of this sub-guild now. &#xA0;The only thing holding me back from moving on is the big picture for this guild. &#xA0;The Big Smiles guild is basically your guild now. &#xA0;Moreover, don&apos;t you want revenge on the Hahoe Mask?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#xB7;&#xB7;&#xB7;&#xB7;&#xB7;&#xB7;Sinclair didn&apos;t budge. &#xA0;How are we going to kill the Hahoe Mask?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Apollo finally broke his silence, and Heh-bibin looked at Apollo with a hardened expression instead of answering the question.</span></p><p><span style="">There was a brief silence, and Heh-bibin didn&apos;t show any signs of wanting to talk.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I want to catch the Hahoe Mask. &#xA0;I want to kill that bastard.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">As if he couldn&apos;t take the silence, Apollo spoke with anger in his voice.</span></p><p><span style="">Heh-bibin took a peek at Apollo. &#xA0;Several thoughts flitted through his mind.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;As I thought, the answer was to poke Apollo.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">When this thought went through his mind, Heh-bibin tried hard to push down the smile that was trying to break out on his face.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;We are of like mind. &#xA0;If the Big Smiles guild allows the Hahoe Mask to act with impunity, it&apos;ll damage us greatly. At the very least, you and I should stand together.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;However, we don&apos;t have a plan ! If it isn&apos;t Sinclair, who&apos;ll be able to go toe-to-toe with the Hahoe Mask?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Apollo reacted in a very temperamental manner. &#xA0;If one considered Apollo&apos;s personality and his past relationship with the Hahoe Mask, it was a predictable reaction. &#xA0;There was no reason why Apollo would be happy about this topic.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Even if we don&apos;t have a User of the same caliber to confront him, there is no reason why we can&apos;t kill him if we go in large numbers. &#xA0;If we decide to catch him, we&apos;ll be able to.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;We couldn&apos;t catch him after sending 1,000 of our Users.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Wasn&apos;t it, because the Stormhunters guild interfered with us? &#xA0;If we think about it logically, even the Hahoe Mask can&apos;t fight a force of 1,000 Users.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I&apos;ve heard those words before.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;We have to hunt him in a way where we&#x2019;ll turn a profit. &#xA0;Even if we send 100 or a 1,000 Users, we&apos;ll turn a profit. &#xA0;The Hahoe Mask is basically the most expensive monster in Warlord.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;If we send a thousand User, he&apos;ll avoid them. &#xA0;Hahoe Mask isn&apos;t dumb. &#xA0;This is how he handles such situations.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Heh-bibin shut his mouth again.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Moreover, the bastard doesn&apos;t have a guild, party, team or even a family! &#xA0;It is impossible to threaten him by kidnapping someone near him. &#xA0;So how are we supposed to pin him down? &#xA0;In recent rumors, it is said he travels by riding a Bone Wyvern. &#xA0;He can fly now, so how can we catch him?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">At that moment...</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ah.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Apollo had an idea. &#xA0;When he had this idea, he had a dazed expression on his face.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Now that I think about it, there is one User, who&#x2019;s close to the Hahoe Mask.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Apollo&apos;s dazed expression turned into a bloody smile.</span></p>
