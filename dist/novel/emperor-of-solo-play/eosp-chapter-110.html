<p><span style="">Chapter 110 - How Much? (2)</span></p><p><span style="">When a User achieves great success in Warlord, everyone starts to comment on the reasons behind the User&apos;s success.</span></p><p><span style="">One of the reasons behind the success was attributed to the excellent AI making up Warlord.</span></p><p><span style="">This was why the Users paid much more attention to the NPCs in Warlord compared to the NPCs of other games. &#xA0;Of course, it wasn&apos;t as if all the NPCs were popular. &#xA0;If an NPC wanted to be popular, one had two fulfill one of the two requirements.</span></p><p><span style="">The NPC had to be either a beautiful woman or a handsome man. &#xA0;If not, the NPC had to &#xA0;have a habit of giving out good Items.</span></p><p><span style="">From that perspective, Ahimbree&apos;s massive popularity was inevitable. &#xA0;Ahimbree was an NPC that gave Items that was beyond good. &#xA0;It was downright amazing.</span></p><p><span style="">Moreover, a User named Cocomo had obtained Ahimbree&apos;s Disciple title, and it seemed he had been short on money. &#xA0;He sold information regarding Ahimbree, which had never been disseminated before. This drove Ahimbree&apos;s popularity into a pitched fever. &#xA0;Numerous Users attempted to become Ahimbree&apos;s Disciple.</span></p><p><span style="">At that point, the much praised AI system of Warlord did something very wise. &#xA0;There were too many Users visiting Ahimbree, so Ahimbree&apos;s residence was moved.</span></p><p><span style="">This was to Hyrkan&apos;s benefit as there weren&apos;t many obstacles when he tried to meet Ahimbree.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Shit. &#xA0;If he was going to move, he should have moved up north. &#xA0;Why the hell did he move to the south?&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">Of course, Hyrkan had been working in the North, so he had to spend a good amount of time traveling towards the south. &#xA0;However, this was a very minor problem.</span></p><p><span style="">The usual office that had always greeted Hyrkan was gone. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Welcome.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;&#x2026;your room is very clean.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">The books that had been strewn about&#x2026; </span></p><p><span style="">Unlike his previous office where the expensive Skill books had coated the floor, his current office was very clean. &#xA0;It was hard to find any books or even a whiff of paper inside the room. </span></p><p><span style="">One would &#xA0;never expect to feel a sense of unease when confronted with a clean room.</span></p><p><span style="">However, Hyrkan felt uneasy.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;The mood is strangely cool.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">He had come here expecting to receive a delicious treat. &#xA0;Instead of a treat, he was worried he might have wasted his time coming here. </span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Eh-ee. &#xA0;At the very least, he&apos;ll still probably give me a Skill. &#xA0;It isn&apos;t as if he would only give a Skill book only if the Skill books were strewn across the floor.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">He tried very hard to push down his anxiety, and Hyrkan greeted Ahimbree.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;How&apos;s your health and peace of mind, teacher?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">He used respectful words that he had utter to his parents before. Hyrkan looked very respectful. </span></p><p><span style="">However, Ahimbree didn&apos;t answer immediately. &#xA0;The NPC kept staring at Hyrkan. It looked like Ahimbree was affected by a system freeze, but the manual explicitly stated that such a scenario wasn&#x2019;t possible. &#xA0;This meant it was really having a hard time answering Hyrkan&apos;s question. It meant Hyrkan&apos;s action had stumped the outstanding AI. The AI was at a loss for words at Hyrkan&apos;s absurd action.</span></p><p><span style="">Ahimbree opened his mouth after more time had passed.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I&apos;ve been well. &#xA0;How have you been?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I&apos;ve had a lot on my plate, so I&apos;ve been busy.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I&apos;m sure your hands were full. &#xA0;Did you perhaps learn of any important information?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan was a bit worried at the question.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Is he fishing for something or is this just a straightforward question? &#xA0;Is he testing the water with me?&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">Ahimbree knew Hyrkan was carrying out activities as a member of the Secret Society. &#xA0;This question was probably &#xA0;intended to ask about his activities related to the Secret Society. &#xA0;Moreover, Hyrkan had gained an important information recently. &#xA0;He had sufficient information where he could cast suspicion on Prince Dean.</span></p><p><span style="">If he continued this conversation with Ahimbree by telling him about the Trigon Emblem, it might be a key to opening a hidden quest.</span></p><p><span style="">On the other hand, he remembered the Maeung&apos;s warning. &#xA0;Maeung told him to tell this information to no one.</span></p><p><span style="">After coming to a surprisingly difficult decision, he decided to keep his mouth shut.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I&apos;m still investigating. &#xA0;Unfortunately, I&apos;m lacking in ability, so it is unfortunate that I can&apos;t be of bigger help.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I heard about your accomplishments from Bagel. I also hear a lot of praise about you. &#xA0;If we have 100 men like you, we could clear the lands across the Terube Castle walls. &#xA0;We&#x2019;ll be able to immediately occupy the lands. &#xA0;He wants to introduce you to Prince Dean as soon as possible.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Bagel. </span></p><p><span style="">As the administrator of the Terube Castle wall, it seemed the NPC had taken a liking to Hyrkan. As someone who serves under Prince Dean as his lord, this was the highest compliment that could be given to Hyrkan.</span></p><p><span style="">Of course, he knew Prince Dean&apos;s real identity, so Hyrkan could only put on an awkward smile.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Thank you.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan calmly ended this particular thread of conversation with a single phrase.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;So why did you come looking for me?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Ahimbree started the conversation in earnest. &#xA0;Hyrkan didn&apos;t hide anything. &#xA0;He spoke immediately.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I&apos;m unable to carry out the Secret Society&apos;s missions with my current level of ability. As you have done for me before, please provide me an opportunity and a stage.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Ahimbree stared at Hyrkan when it heard his words. It was an NPC, but the light in its eyes was really strange. &#xA0;It really felt as if an incredible sage was seeing into Hyrkan&apos;s heart. &#xA0;It almost made him believe that it wasn&apos;t an NPC. </span></p><p><span style="">However, Hyrkan didn&apos;t turn away from the gaze. The saving of one&apos;s face and sense of shame... &#xA0;Those words weren&apos;t in Hyrkan&apos;s dictionary. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">Its gaze gave him goosebumps.</span></p><p><span style="">Ahimbree stared into Hyrkan&apos;s eyes as it spoke.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;You are already plenty strong. &#xA0;I cannot do anything for you. Moreover, don&apos;t you already know about the methods to become stronger?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Its words were dressed up adequately, but in the end, it meant it couldn&apos;t provide a stage like the Battlefield from before. &#xA0;It basically meant Hyrkan couldn&apos;t suck out any honey here from Ahimbree.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I want to learn a new magic.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan immediately gave a straightforward comment. Even if Ahimbree had sent him to a stage like the Battlefield, Hyrkan wouldn&apos;t have gone.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Magic isn&apos;t something that is easily earned.&#x201D; &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;If I wanted to take the easy road, I wouldn&apos;t have come here. Please you can give me any trials and tribulations!&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan spoke in a sincere tone.</span></p><p><span style="">Of course, his inner thoughts differed from his tone.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Please give me an easy one. &#xA0;I want the really easy task. &#xA0;Please.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">Warlord&apos;s difficulty was almost limitless. &#xA0;In Warlord, an NPC of Ahimbree&apos;s stature could give really difficult Quests. &#xA0;Those were the ones that Users didn&apos;t even bother completing.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;You should search out the Magician&apos;s Tower. It would be better for you to ask them for help instead of me.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Ahimbree once again expressed words that rejected Hyrkan. &#xA0;Maybe this was to be expected. It would be absurd to expect a free Skill at this point in the game.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Yes, this is the right answer.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">In the end, Hyrkan had to accept it.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Everything was going so well for so long that I lost myself for a moment. It was stupid of me to come here.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">The problem lay with him. &#xA0;He was the one who had come searching for the easiest and most obvious answer in Ahimbree.</span></p><p><span style="">At that moment, Ahimbree continued to speak.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;If you give a big contribution to the Magician&apos;s Tower, the Magician&apos;s Tower will surely give you a &#xA0;recompense.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Huh?&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">For a brief moment, Hyrkan combed through his memory. It felt as if he had heard about something similiar to this before.</span></p><p><span style="">However, Ahimbree gave a clearer explanation before Hyrkan could search through his memories.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;The Magician&apos;s Tower always needs a lot of help. &#xA0;They need testing ingredients and other various needs.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Will you look at this?&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan let out a yell of delight inside his heart. &#xA0;Ahimbree couldn&apos;t directly give him a skill, but it seemed he&apos;ll be able to earn a Skill book from the Magician&apos;s Tower. &#xA0;From Hyrkan&apos;s perspective, he didn&apos;t care where he got the Skill book.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Of course, their biggest need is operational funds.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">At that moment, Hyrkan&apos;s expression did a 180.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Funds? What fund? I...it can&apos;t be true.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Donation. That is the sure fire thing they want.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Huhk.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">From Hyrkan&apos;s mouth, the sound of him gasping was automatically let out. Ahimbree didn&apos;t even register Hyrkan&apos;s change of countenance as he continued to speak. </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I think around 100 thousand gold should be enough. &#xA0;You&apos;ll be able to learn a magic befitting your level.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Sship? Sship? Did you just say Sship?&#x201D; </span><strong>1</strong></p><p><span style="">His words had come out reflexively yet Ahimbree decided to react to Hyrkan&apos;s words.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Is that a problem?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">It seemed sship had sounded like a curse word to Ahimbree. &#xA0;In truth, it was a form of curse word if one considered how he was feeling.</span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan quickly changed his words.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Sship&#x2026;&#x2026; So you were saying Sship-mahn gold would be enough?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;That&apos;s right. A donation of that size would be plenty enough to get what you want.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">It happened at that moment.</span></p><p><span style="">[The Quest &apos;Meaningful Donation&apos; has started.] </span></p><p><span style="">The critical blow was struck when the announcement rang in his ears.</span></p><p><span style="">Ahn-jaehyun had a cup of water in front of him, and he had his eyes closed. Ahn-jaehyun had an outdated Tablet PC in his hand. Someone else&apos;s SNS page was open on the LCD. If one looked at the number of subscribers, it seemed the owner of the SNS page was very popular. &#xA0;The owner was a handsome white man with blonde hair and blue eyes.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Somehow, &#xA0;things always find a way to go sideways.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">Donation Quest.</span></p><p><span style="">He felt a chill run up his spine from just hearing that name.</span></p><p><span style="">At first, Ahn-jaehyun hadn&apos;t been too worried about the quest.</span></p><p><span style="">In truth, he didn&apos;t even need to think on it. &#xA0;It would be crazy to spend 100 thousand gold for a level 140 Skill book. &#xA0;Currently, the level 160 and 170 Skill Books had been released into the market. &#xA0;These Skill books were popular yet it was traded for a similar price. &#xA0;So why should he spend 100 thousand gold in buying one of the skills regarding the unpopular Black Magician Body Modification Skill Tree?</span></p><p><span style="">Still, he researched about the skill reward as a precaution. There might be someone, who might have finished this Quest. &#xA0;He decided to research into it first.</span></p><p><span style="">In truth, he was sure he wouldn&#x2019;t find a crazy bastard, who had gone through with this Quest.</span></p><p><span style="">Couple million people were spending quite a lot of money to play this game, and it seemed there was a User crazy enough to torch a large sum of money on such a Quest. </span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;I think I regret searching for this in the first place.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">Woody.</span></p><p><span style="">He was a world famous singer and actor named Neal Whittaker. &#xA0;Woody was his name in Warlord. &#xA0;Amongst the worldwide celebrities, he was known to be an incredible fan of Warlord. &#xA0;He had played the game since the game service started, and he had poured an incredible amount of money into the game. &#xA0;However, his level was a bit low considering how much time and money he had spent in this game. &#xA0;He was level 141. However, if one ranked Users on the money spent on the game, he would easily be within the top 50. &#xA0;His love for Warlord was that large.</span></p><p><span style="">At the same time, it was a twisted form of love. Woody had so much money that it pained him to not be able to surround himself with luxury items. He acted like a rich person showing off his sports car. &#xA0;He was someone who loved to boast about his unbridled spending on the SNS.</span></p><p><span style="">That guy had done the 100 thousand gold Donation Quest. &#xA0;As a reward, he had been able to choose a level 140 Unique Skill.</span></p><p><span style="">At that point, Ahn-jaehyun would have just ignored this all together. Instead of buying a Skill book with a price tag of 100 thousand, it would be more advisable and healthier for him to go a hotel buffet, and leave after eating salad.</span></p><p><span style="">The problem was that this Donation Quest&apos;s reward didn&apos;t have a fixed reward. One could choose the reward.</span></p><p><span style="">Once one chose a Skill Tree, one will have an unrestricted view of the Skill Tree from level 1 to level 190. &#xA0;Then it&apos;ll allow one to choose a Skill below one&apos;s level. &#xA0;Since this was a level 140 Quest, the best he could choose was a level 140 Skill.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;If I donate 100 thousand gold, I could see the little known Body Modification Skill Tree.... &#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">The key point was the fact that he&apos;ll be able to see the entire array of his choices.</span></p><p><span style="">This wasn&apos;t just about gaining a skill. &#xA0;He would be able to find out about the entire Skill tree of his choice, and this information was a very precious information one couldn&apos;t even buy with money.</span></p><p><span style="">The numerous Users of this game gather fragmentary information to puzzle out the Skill Trees. &#xA0;It was a hard task. &#xA0;He&apos;ll be able to see such a Skill Tree for the price of 100 thousand gold, and it was well worth the price.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Shit.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">This was the reason why he was agonizing over the decision.</span></p><p><span style="">Of course, Ahn-jaehyun&apos;s best case scenario was for another person to confirm and reveal the Body Modification Skill Tree.</span></p><p><span style="">That was a pipe dream.</span></p><p><span style="">In the first place, Warlord&apos;s magician population was highly skewed towards white magicians. Recently, the ratio had shifted towards Black Magicians by a little bit, because of the Hahoe Mask&apos;s exploit.</span></p><p><span style="">He had been lucky with the Curse Skill Tree, since the Curse Monks were popular. &#xA0;He was able to gain enough information regarding the Curse Skill Tree. &#xA0;However, this wasn&apos;t the case for the Summon Skill Tree and the Body Modification Skill Tree.</span></p><p><span style="">In regard to the Summon Skill Tree, even the veteran Necromancers didn&apos;t recognized the Skills used by Hyrkan.</span></p><p><span style="">&apos;Our Class has that kind of Skill?&apos;</span></p><p><span style="">&apos;What&apos;s that horn growing out of the Skeleton&apos;s head, Hahoe Mask-nim?&apos;</span></p><p><span style="">The Body Modification Skill Tree was something one had to be over level 100 to obtain. &#xA0;This was why there weren&apos;t any information regarding this particular Skill Tree out in the open.</span></p><p><span style="">It was possible that there were Users, who might be aiming for a Magic Swordsman type character. &#xA0;&#xA0;In that particular situation, the Black Magician would have to advance the Body Modification Skill Tree. Hyrkan had just found a User, who had spent 100 thousand gold to progress an unknown Quest, so it wasn&#x2019;t too far-fetched to think that a Magic Swordsman was out there.</span></p><p><span style="">Still, there was no way that a User, who had spent 100 thousand gold to learn the Body Modification Skill Tree, would reveal this information to the public. </span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;However, there is a possibility that this bastard might be selling snake oil. &#xA0;Isn&apos;t he an attention whore? &#xA0;If I finish the Quest and....&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">Woody hadn&apos;t revealed the Skill Tree he gained in its entirety. He wrote he would reveal additional information as his number of subscribers grew. &#xA0;Currently, he had revealed Skills that most Users had already figured out. &#xA0;This was why there was a chance that this might be a stunt being pulled by Woody to gain more attention.</span></p><p><span style="">If Woody was lying, Hyrkan might just receive a single Skill Book for 100 thousand gold.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hoo-ooh.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Ahn-jaehyun finally drank the cup of water in front of him. &#xA0;He downed it in one shot.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;If this is some plot to inflate the number of subscribers, I&apos;ll kill you 100 thousand times with my bare hands, Woody.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">He had drunk the cold water, but it was having a hard time cooling his boiling insides.</span></p><p><span style=""> _______________</span></p><p></p><ol><p></p><p></p><li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="">Ship-mahn = 100 thousand &#xA0;Sship-pahl = curse word. &#xA0;They sound phonetically the same in the beginning. &#xA0;NPC thought Hyrkan was trying to curse. </span></li><p></p><p></p></ol><p></p>
