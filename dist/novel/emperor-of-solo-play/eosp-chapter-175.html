<p>Chapter 175 &#x2013; Red Desert (2)</p><p>4.</p><p><span style="">[Elven Artifact] </span></p><p><span style="">- Quest Rank : Unique</span></p><p><span style="">- Quest Level Range : 200</span></p><p><span style="">- Quest Content : The Red Elf tribe ostracizes all beings that approaches them. &#xA0;If you want to be accepted by them, you have to find the Artifact left behind by the Elves. &#xA0;Please find the Artifact.</span></p><p><span style="">- Quest Reward : Grave Keeper&apos;s Key.</span></p><p><span style="">When he looked at the newly gained Quest Content, his visage froze as it set in a heavy expression.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Does Warlord really hate me? &#xA0;Why does it keep giving me such Quests?&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">The Quest Content looked easy at a glance. &#xA0;He just have to find and return an artifact. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">However, if one was a User of Warlord, one knew how bottomless such a Quest could be. &#xA0;He clicked his tongue in dismay. &#xA0;Any Quests related to the Elves made him feel irritated from the start. &#xA0;If one wanted a relationship with the Elves, then one had to find the tribes. &#xA0;It wasn&apos;t an easy task.</span></p><p><span style="">Moreover, it just said find the Elven Artifact. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">It didn&apos;t specify which Elven Artifact. &#xA0;There were no other clues.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;I would rather kill Anugas....&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">At that moment, he thought it would be easier to face a monster like Anugas. &#xA0;He would rather face a monster where he didn&apos;t know the method to kill it.</span></p><p><span style="">Of course, this was also a special characteristic of the Main Scenario Quest. &#xA0;It was the same starting from the first Main Scenario Quest. &#xA0;In the Corrupted Cout Episode, it hadn&apos;t been just about killing strong monsters. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">The stages provided by Warlord had a variety of contents, and one had to finish Quests all across the board. &#xA0;It required the Users to go through a lot of these contents to progress in the game. &#xA0;This was to be expected.</span></p><p><span style="">However, up until now, the Main Scenario Quest was powered through by brute force. &#xA0;This was true of Hyrkan, Stormhunters guild, Red Bulls guild and more. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">It was an unnatural and a not so clever method. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">These Users didn&apos;t take the time to enjoy the game.</span></p><p><span style="">From that perspective, he finally arrived at that point. &#xA0;A wall had appeared and it couldn&apos;t be jumped over by power.</span></p><p><span style="">This was why Hyrkan gave up on attempting this Quest early on, and he had contacted Whistling.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;I didn&apos;t want to get him involved if possible...&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">He didn&apos;t have a favorable view on his current situation.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Tsk.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">First, it made it seem like he contacted Whistling only when Hyrkan needed him. &#xA0;He didn&apos;t like the optic of it. &#xA0;How rotten was it to look for a friend only when one needed something?</span></p><p><span style="">On the other hand, this was a privilege of being friends. </span></p><p><span style="">Even if one ignored such feelings, Whistling was now a member of the Hydra guild. &#xA0;It wouldn&#x2019;t &#xA0;look good to others if Whistling met up with Hyrkan.</span></p><p><span style="">No one would welcome the meeting of Whistling and Hyrkan at the best of times. &#xA0;This meeting would be viewed very unfavorably if it became known.</span></p><p><span style="">No one would see it as a meeting between friends.</span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan&apos;s current location was the the evidence of his reticence.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Here you are.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan was pleased when a face that resembled a hunting dog appeared from between the overgrown trees.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Uh. &#xA0;You are here?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan looked like the awkward friend one meets in an uncomfortable location.</span></p><p><span style="">On the other hand, Whistling didn&apos;t look out of sorts at all.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Your accomplishments up until now has been tremendous.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;It&#x2019;s adequate.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">They were in a hunting ground. &#xA0;It was a very remote hunting ground where one would rarely come across a User. &#xA0;There were no monsters or Users here. &#xA0;It was a very nice place to meet someone.</span></p><p><span style="">However, Whistling wasn&apos;t the only User, who had arrived at this place of meeting.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ooh-wahhhh.... &#xA0;&#xA0;It really is the Hahoe Mask.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;H...Hahoe Mask. &#xA0;I am a fan.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">There were two additional Users.</span></p><p><span style="">The two Users had expressions filled with surprise. &#xA0;Hyrkan looked hard at the two.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Yojori and Joba.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">Whistling had given him a heads up. &#xA0;Whistling told Hyrkan that he had to move around with two others. &#xA0;If Hyrkan hadn&#x2019;t like the idea of meeting the two, the meeting would have been called off.</span></p><p><span style="">Whistling also added that these two skilled Users were trustworthy.</span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan trusted Pitbull&#x2019;s words, so he invited the other two Users too. </span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Yojori&#xB7;&#xB7;&#xB7;&#xB7;&#xB7;&#xB7;.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan somewhat knew of the User named Yojori.</span></p><p><span style="">She looked kinda like a slightly pudgy cat, and Yojori hadn&#x2019;t become famous until the Ruined Kingdom episode. &#xA0;In the Ruined Kingdom episode, her fame skyrocketed.</span></p><p><span style="">As the Hydra guild progressed in the Ruined Kingdom episode, Yojori worked under a Quest taskforce, and the guild had made a program centered around her. &#xA0;Her program was a hit, so she was quite famous.</span></p><p><span style="">Of course, if one analyzed her a little deeper, Yojori was different from most Users. &#xA0;Moreover, her uniqueness was well received by the public.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;She was a bit of a nut case.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">If one was nice about it, she lived in the 4th dimension. &#xA0;If one gave a rough description, she was a weirdo. &#xA0;If one wanted to disparage her, she was crazy.</span></p><p><span style="">A User like Yojori couldn&#x2019;t be understood by others. &#xA0;In truth, her program was popular, but she herself was only moderately popular. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan hadn&#x2019;t been interested in her, so his memories were a bit fuzzy. &#xA0;However, he did remember the scene where she ranked every single NPC by their appearance.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;I don&apos;t know this guy.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">On the other hand, Hyrkan had no recollection of Joba.</span></p><p><span style="">However, Hyrkan just had to sift through Joba&#x2019;s background information. &#xA0;Hyrkan could sufficiently guess at what made this User a bit unique.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;He is a level 210 Magic Swordsman type&#x2026; &#xA0;He&#x2019;s a bit twisted.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">There were a lot of Magicians, who had finished their 2nd Advancement. &#xA0;However, there were only a handful of Magic Swordsman type in existence, and level 210 was fairly high.</span></p><p><span style="">On top of it all, Magic Swordsman types focused on Raids in Warlord. &#xA0;&#xA0;They were developed with the thought of helping out the guild in mind. &#xA0;Magic Swordsman were the best at managing aggros of monsters. &#xA0;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">However, Joba was part of the Quest Exploration team instead of a Raid team. &#xA0;At the very least, he couldn&#x2019;t be seen as a normal User.</span></p><p><span style="">These factors weren&#x2019;t enough to soften Hyrkan&#x2019;s expression.</span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan wasn&#x2019;t looking at the two with a friendly expression, and even though he was wearing a Hahoe Mask, his emotion was transmitted to the two.</span></p><p><span style="">Yojori and Joba flinched in surprise.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Why is he being liking this? Is there some kind of a problem?&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Did I wrong the Hahoe Mask in the past? &#xA0;Did he somehow found out about my weird comments beneath his youtube videos? &#xA0;I&#x2019;m pretty sure I didn&#x2019;t cuss at him.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">Every User in Warlord knew about the Hahoe Mask, but Yojori and Joba were self-proclaimed Hahoe Mask fans. &#xA0;They were very well informed about his tendencies, so they knew he was very temperamental. &#xA0;He was ruthless against anyone, who got on his nerves. &#xA0;Moreover, he had no compunction about using cheap and dirty methods from time to time. &#xA0;They knew he was the real deal. &#xA0;He was a veteran expert.</span></p><p><span style="">Of course, the two would be nervous standing in front of him.</span></p><p><span style="">After staring at the two, Hyrkan turned his gaze towards Whistling.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Are they original members of the Hydra guild?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;We can&#x2019;t say we are one of the original members, but we&#x2019;ve been in the Hydra guild long enough that we could be seen as original members.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Will you guys be ok?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What do you mean?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I don&apos;t mind receiving help from the Hydra guild, but wouldn&apos;t it be a problem for you guys? &#xA0;It isn&apos;t as if you guys received permission from the guild to come here.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan only needed Whistling&apos;s help. &#xA0;However, there was a troublesome barrier between the two called the Hydra guild.</span></p><p><span style="">From Hyrkan&#x2019;s perspective, he didn&#x2019;t want the Hydra guild to get hold of information regarding the Main Scenario Quest. &#xA0;Of course, we wouldn&#x2019;t mind a give and take relationship. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">However, he needed something worthwhile to break through his reluctance. </span></p><p><span style="">On the contrary, Whistling was in a tough situation. &#xA0;If he helped the Hahoe Masked without informing the Hydra guild, Whistling and the two other Users here would be taking on a huge risk.</span></p><p><span style="">However, Whistling gave a clear answer regarding this perceived problem.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I don&apos;t need the guild&apos;s permission. &#xA0;If they have a problem with me, I can just leave. &#xA0;Anyways, I&apos;ve never received help from the Hydra guild. &#xA0;It is the same for these two. &#xA0;&#xA0;We just need to give the Hydra guild information about the Quests we are on, and nothing else.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Whistling was very clear with his answer. &#xA0;It was easily given, because Whistling viewed Warlord as only a game, and nothing more.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;This is why the consent of these two is more important than getting permission from the guild. &#xA0;I share a common destiny with these two. &#xA0;Maybe it is more apt to say that we all share the same Quests. &#xA0;Moreover, I&#x2019;ve received a lot of help from them.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;No. &#xA0;We received much more help from you than we gave.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;If it wasn&apos;t for Whistling oppa, we wouldn&apos;t have been able to get this far in the Elven Quests!&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">They spoke at the same time in an embarrassed fashion, but the two glared at each other when their words overlapped.</span></p><p><span style="">While the two were glaring at each other, Whistling finished speaking.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;This is why if those two didn&#x2019;t agree to it, I couldn&#x2019;t have helped you on your Quest.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Help.</span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan was barely able to suppress his bitter laugh at the choice of word.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;He is still the romantic.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">He&#x2019;ll help.</span></p><p><span style="">It was a phrase that was easy on the ears, but Hyrkan had heard those word only a few times in Warlord. &#xA0;It had always been a give and take. &#xA0;It had always been a deal.</span></p><p><span style="">In Hyrkan&#x2019;s vocabulary, help meant that he would have to pay back this gesture down the line. He had expected Whistling to demand an arrangement with him. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;The final reason is the fact that your Quest and our Quest may be intertwined in some way. &#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;This is also why I cannot make this decision by myself. &#xA0;My Quest is our Quest.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">At that point, Hyrkan was about to indulge himself in his sentimental feelings. &#xA0;He pulled himself back from that hole of emotion.</span></p><p><span style="">He was thankful.</span></p><p><span style="">He was thankful for the offer of help, and he appreciated the offer of leaving the Hydra guild to help him.</span></p><p><span style="">Unfortunately, Hyrkan couldn&#x2019;t view Warlord as just a game like Whistling.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;All right. &#xA0;Let&#x2019;s draw a clear line here. &#xA0;I need to be able to get into the town of the Red Elves. &#xA0;Let us cooperate until that point.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan decided to make this into a deal.</span></p><p><span style="">For a brief moment, a bitter smile crossed Whistling mouth before it was erased.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I guess I&apos;ll give the formal introduction. &#xA0;Yojori and Joba. &#xA0;I think it&apos;ll be enough to describe them as a Crusader and a Magic Swordsman. &#xA0;Joba has the highest level at 210. &#xA0;I&apos;m at level 207, and Yojori is level 206. &#xA0;&#xA0;This is the Hahoe Mask. &#xA0;He is famous, so do I need to speak any further?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">At those words, the two Users opened their mouths as if they had been waiting for it.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Of course not.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;It is an honor to be meeting you. &#xA0;I know this might be out of bounds on a first meeting, but do you think I could get a selfie with you?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ah! &#xA0;Please I would like one too. &#xA0;Of course, I decline being in the same picture as him.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I also don&#x2019;t want to be in the same frame as her.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;You should ignore him.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;No, he should ignore you. &#xA0;Damn Crusader! &#xA0;Hahoe Mask-nim is an exalted Lich! &#xA0;You are the polar opposite of him, you perverted bitch!&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Did I say to the contrary? &#xA0;Isn&#x2019;t he a bit too noisy?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Mumble mumble.</span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan took his eyes off the two to look at Whistling. &#xA0;Whistling&#x2019;s eyebrows and shoulders shrugged.</span></p><p><span style="">There was no way his future would be quiet.</span></p><p>5.</p><p><span style="">&#x201C;The storyline for the Red Elves was present before anyone came to the Black Continent.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">When Hyrkan and Whistling&apos;s Family decided to ally with each other, they conducted a briefing where they exchanged information regarding the Quests.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I first came across it on a level 160 Quest called the Heir of the Barley Kingdom. &#xA0;It happened a long time ago in the Barley Kingdom.... &#xA0;If we put it in terms of the current outlook on the world, it is another ruined kingdom. &#xA0;Anyways, this was an Elven Kingdom, and all the Elves on this continent were once citizens of this Kingdom.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I&apos;ll expand on my explanation a little bit. &#xA0;When I finished the Heir of the Barley Kingdom episode, I immediately gained maximum Intimacy Level with the Yoomoo tribe. &#xA0;As a benefit, I was able entered the protected Record Trees. &#xA0;The Record Trees are amazing. &#xA0;Once something was recorded within the tree, it eventually creates a seed. &#xA0;This seed could be planted elsewhere, and whatever that was recorded before would come out as leaves in the new tree. &#xA0;It was like a living library. &#xA0;When I saw it, I was moved.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;The Black Dwarves will create the spears and shield that will be able to harm them. &#xA0;The Red Fae will hide these weapons. &#xA0;In the distant future, the humans equipped with these spears and shields will be able to pierce through the Curse. &#xA0;Their hearts will be pierced by the spear!&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Huh? You memorized it?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I&apos;m smarter than you.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;You probably read it off of a picture you took before. You are being pretentious.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">In a flash, the briefing strayed from the main topic, so it was up to Whistling to tie the end.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;In summary, the Red Elf tribe had been tasked to store these weapons. &#xA0;They held this role before the Ruined Kingdom was ruined. &#xA0;This is where your Quest comes in. &#xA0;You received the Elven Artifact Quest, and it is talking about the Artifacts left behind by the Barley Kingdom.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan felt faint as he heard the briefing.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;If I did this by myself, I wouldn&apos;t have known about this hint.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">It was an Artifact of the Barley Kingdom? &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan didn&apos;t know about this storyline.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;This is troublesome. &#xA0;That means I have to find the Quest that deals with the Barley Kingdom&#x2019;s Artifacts, then progress through it&#x2026;..&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">He was fortunate to have been able to find a hint like this. &#xA0;If he hadn&#x2019;t, it would have been like pressing the reset button during a game.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Fortunately, we are progressing in the Quest to find the Barley Kingdom&#x2019;s Artifacts. &#xA0;Moreover, we found a clue.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan became startled at Whistling&apos;s words.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Really?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">He never expected for his dilemma to be resolved like this.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;We have to go north.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">After speaking, Whistling turned to look at Yojori. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">She took out an Item, and this Item was a Conch made out of gem.</span></p><p><span style="">The light in Hyrkan&apos;s eyes changed.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;The Gem Conch has already made its appearance?&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">Conches were crucial Items needed for one to be guided through the Ruined Kingdom Episode.</span></p><p><span style="">Moreover, the worth of a Conch differed depending on what it was made out of. &#xA0;The most common one was the Wooden Conch. &#xA0;If one was progressing through Quests, it was common to see a User carrying around two to three Wooden Conches. &#xA0;In the extreme end, some Users carried around a dozen Wooden Conches. &#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;Then there were the Golden Conches, which were a tier above. &#xA0;The last type was the Gem Conches. &#xA0;There was no tier above the Gem conches.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;This is driving me nuts.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan once again felt a weird sense of dissonance. &#xA0;He knew the game was progressing at a rapid pace, but the speed differed too much from his knowledge. &#xA0;It wasn&#x2019;t just the speed that had changed. &#xA0;The distance one had to travel had shortened too.</span></p><p><span style="">Of course, Hyrkan didn&#x2019;t question this truth for long. </span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;The all mighty AI will do its job.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">The fact that he had those questions didn&#x2019;t mean he&#x2019;ll find the answers to it. &#xA0;Hyrkan was far from being a curious man.</span></p><p><span style="">The most important thing for him was to eat the preys that were right in front of him.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;The problem is the fact that we can&#x2019;t go north. &#xA0;First, it isn&#x2019;t Hydra guild&#x2019;s territory. &#xA0;Moreover, everyone has pretty much given up exploring north past the Highwood Forest.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan nodded his head at Whistling&#x2019;s words.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I don&#x2019;t know about the other things, but I can guarantee a comfortable passage through the Red Desert. &#xA0;You&#x2019;ll ride a bus that normally you won&#x2019;t be able to ride even with money.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">He finally established the give and take relationship at that moment.</span></p><p>6.</p><p><span style="">Heh-bibin was watching a video.</span></p><p><span style="">Puh-uhng, puh-uhng! </span></p><p><span style="">Inside the video, the rare Boss Monster Black Tree was being lit up by explosions like a &#xA0;Christmas Tree. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">This was the Hahoe Mask&#x2019;s debut pay-per-view video called Christmas Tree&#x2019;s Nightmare. &#xA0;It sold over 2 million videos, and it was considered to be one of the classic masterpieces by the fans of Warlord. &#xA0;An year&apos;s time was forever in terms of online time.</span></p><p><span style="">Heh-bibin also remembered several things about this footage&#x2026;</span></p><p><span style="">It was hard to call it a good memory, yet several harsh events were etched into his memory.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;I&#x2019;m sure of it. &#xA0;Pitbull is the one that shows up briefly within the footage.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">While this footage was being filmed, the Big Smiles guild had been gearing up for a war with the Fighters guild. &#xA0;They tried to hunt down Pitbull to provoke a war, and Apollo had been in charge of that mission. &#xA0;Moreover, Heh-bibin was one of the figures that had sponsored the mission.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;After this video, we tried to hunt down Pitbull&#x2026; &#xA0;We failed. </span></p><p><span style="">During the hunt, a problem occurred. &#xA0;There was a disrupter called the Hahoe Mask. &#xA0;No one expected him to show up. </span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;If I think back on it, it is hard to see it as an random act of violence.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">At the time, he had thought the Hahoe Mask was trying to kick Big Smiles, while they were down. &#xA0;The Hahoe Mask, Apollo and Big Smiles didn&#x2019;t have a good relationship. &#xA0;If one took their relationship in context, it wouldn&#x2019;t be strange to see it as a random act of violence perpetrated towards the other party.</span></p><p><span style="">However, now he saw that the Hahoe Mask had no reason to save Pitbull&#x2019;s life. &#xA0;Of course, this was assuming there was no connection between Pitbull and the Hahoe Mask.</span></p><p><span style="">When his thoughts arrived at that point, Heh-bibin earnestly did his research. &#xA0;He wanted to see if Pitbull and the Hahoe Mask had travelled together before. &#xA0;Unexpectedly, he found a lot of information in regards to their closeness.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;The Hahoe Mask has no ties with the Hydra guild. &#xA0;These two guys&#x2019; relationship started during the Fighters guild&#x2019;s days, where Whistling Pitbull was a token guild member. &#xA0;Moreover, the Hahoe Mask had no relationship to the Fighters guild either. &#xA0;If they did, they would have already risen to being one of the 30 great guilds.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">Heh-bibin went through various scenarios to come up with this conclusion.</span></p><p><span style="">They were personal acquaintances. &#xA0;The personal relationship was between the Hahoe Mask and the Pitbull.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;If I poke Pitbull, the Hahoe Mask will come out.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">Of course, if the Big Smiles guild attacked Pitbull, he&apos;ll monitor to see how the Hahoe Mask responded.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;&#xB7;&#xB7;&#xB7;&#xB7;&#xB7;&#xB7;that sounds too one-dimensional.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">However, Heh-bibin wasn&#x2019;t aiming for that reaction.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;If I poke Pitbull, the first to respond would be the Hydra guild.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">The Hydra guild would mobilize before the Hahoe Mask, because Pitbull was now a member of the Hydra guild.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;This is great. &#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">This was what he was aiming for.</span></p><p><span style="">Heh-bibin was a sub-guild master of the Big Smiles guild. &#xA0;It was a pretty high position. &#xA0;It was a higher position than the rank of officer in the previous iteration of the Big Smiles guild. &#xA0;However, the actual power he had was much lower than before. &#xA0;He didn&#x2019;t even have the right to speak in regards to the state of affairs of the Big Smiles guild.</span></p><p><span style="">In truth, the Big Smiles guild was held by the hands of Sinclair and Brooks. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">The sub-guild master Apollo was their sycophant. &#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">The Big Smiles guild was geared towards appeasing Sinclair. &#xA0;Sinclair held more power than the Guild Master Brooks.</span></p><p><span style="">It was so bad that Apollo contacted Sinclair first rather than the Guild Master Brooks.</span></p><p><span style="">Moreover, Heh-bibin hadn&#x2019;t been given the position of sub-guild master, because they favored him. &#xA0;In the reorganization of the Big Smiles guild, Brooks and Heh-bibin had been against each other. &#xA0;When Heh-bibin lost the power struggle, he was given a high position, so the guild wouldn&#x2019;t implode. &#xA0;If Brooks had just excised him out of the guild, Heh-bibin would have nothing to lose. &#xA0;He would have come at them as if it was a matter of life or death. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">Of course, now the three members had established their power base, and they were slowly eating away at Heh-bibin&#x2019;s power.</span></p><p><span style="">Now the opinions of the Five Stars were more important than the Big Smiles guild. &#xA0;Decisions had to be agreed by the five guilds, and Heh-bibin was just an insignificant part of one of the guilds. &#xA0;He could do nothing. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;I never expected such a good excuse to show up. &#xA0;This is the best.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">This was why he started making preparations. </span></p><p><span style="">Heh-bibin was going to reverse his fortune.</span></p><p><span style="">If he wanted to turn the tide, he needed to shake up the game board.</span></p><p><span style="">The current game board didn&#x2019;t allow him to anything. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">He had to create an imbalance, and he&#x2019;ll able to flip the fractured parts.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;I just have to use Apollo. &#xA0;&#xA0;We just have to kill Pitbull. &#xA0;I don&#x2019;t care if it is the Hydra guild or the Hahoe Mask. &#xA0;They&#x2019;ll fight us.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">The Hydra guild and the Hahoe Mask was sufficient enough of an adversary. &#xA0;Of course, in the process, the Big Smiles guild would suffer big damages. &#xA0;However, that didn&#x2019;t matter to Heh-bibin. &#xA0;In the end, the responsibility will fall on the people above him, who held all the power.</span></p><p><span style="">The only thing he was certain was the fact that his situation couldn&#x2019;t get any worse from doing this. &#xA0;Heh-bibin was already at rock bottom.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;I&#x2019;ll make you all pay for ignoring me.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">After finishing this thought, Heh-bibin contacted Apollo.</span></p>
