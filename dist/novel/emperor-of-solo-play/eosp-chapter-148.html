<p>Chapter 148 - Ancient Power (1)</p><p>1.</p><p><span style="">Hyrkan was holding onto a bone that was the size of a pencil. &#xA0;It started to expand to fill his hand. &#xA0;He shook his wrist as he held onto the thickened bone, and the bone immediately enlarged into a large spear.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hoo-ooh!&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">After taking a short breath, Hyrkan got into his stance.</span></p><p><span style="">Javelin Throw.</span></p><p><span style="">He was aiming for an enemy that was very far away, so this was harder than it looked.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Hoo-ooh!&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">The distance wasn&apos;t a problem. &#xA0;The problem was the fine control that was needed to do it. &#xA0;Moreover, there were external factors that interfered with his concentration.</span></p><p><span style="">There was a fierce battle going on in front of Hyrkan&apos;s eyes. &#xA0;At times, the battle came right up to his nose.</span></p><p><span style="">The Cursed slaves controlled by the Frost Knight was trying to break through the Skeleton Warriors to get to him. &#xA0;The Skeleton Warriors were trying to protect its master. &#xA0;The Skeleton Warriors got in the way as they fought the enemies that was trying to make a path towards Hyrkan.</span></p><p><span style="">Kah-ahng!</span></p><p><span style="">The rough sounds of steel clashing was an evidence of this fierce fight. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">Kwah-jeek.</span></p><p><span style="">The sound of flesh, armor and bones being crushed didn&apos;t show any signs of dying down.</span></p><p><span style="">Koohng!</span></p><p><span style="">Whenever some large monster fell, a large sound was made, and it shook all the beings that had their feet on the battlefield.</span></p><p><span style="">Moreover, at times, some monsters got through the Skeleton Warriors. This was what had happened right now. &#xA0;A monster eventually had gotten past the efforts of the Skeleton Warriors. &#xA0;A monster with frozen arms was attacking Hyrkan. &#xA0;It had its arm, which was as sharp as a sword, up in the air as it approached Hyrkan. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">As this was happening, Hyrkan had to aim and hit his target. &#xA0;It wasn&apos;t an easy task.</span></p><p><span style="">It shouldn&apos;t have been easy....</span></p><p><span style="">Shoong! </span></p><p><span style="">However, Hyrkan did it too easily. &#xA0;He did it effortlessly. &#xA0;The Cursed slave, which had bypassed the Skeleton Warriors, had almost reached him, yet Hyrkan had accomplished his task. &#xA0;He had true in his aim as he hurled the javelin.</span></p><p><span style="">Shweeeek! </span></p><p><span style="">The spear didn&apos;t fly in an arc. &#xA0;It traveled in a straight line.</span></p><p><span style="">At the same time as he threw his spear, he took a step forward as if he had intended to do it.</span></p><p><span style="">He shortened the distance with the Frozen Orc that was rushing him.</span></p><p><span style="">The gap had closed much quicker by him, and the Frozen Orc didn&apos;t hesitate to swing its arm towards Hyrkan&apos;s head. &#xA0;Hyrkan easily dodged the attack by lowering his head.</span></p><p><span style="">Puhk! </span></p><p><span style="">Then he lightly stuck out his foot to trip the Frozen Orc.</span></p><p><span style="">Koo-oohng! </span></p><p><span style="">The Frozen Orc fell forward, and it didn&apos;t even have the chance to turn its body around to look up at the sky.</span></p><p><span style="">Choo-roong! </span></p><p><span style="">The Crying Sword had severed its head with a single strike. &#xA0;The severed head rolled away.</span></p><p><span style="">Bbuh-uhng! </span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan kicked the head as if he was playing soccer. &#xA0;Then he looked at the Skeleton Warriors with cold eyes.</span></p><p><span style="">Was this all the Skeleton Warriors could do?</span></p><p><span style="">This was the message he conveyed in his gaze. &#xA0;Of course, the look shouldn&apos;t have worked on the Skeleton Warriors, but one could see the Skeleton Warriors start to shift towards being more aggressive in their attack. &#xA0;Hyrkan tried to hold back a laughter when he saw this.</span></p><p><span style="">At that moment...</span></p><p><span style="">Koohng!</span></p><p><span style="">Until now, the Frost Knight had looked over the battlefield in a detached manner. &#xA0;No, he had looked down at it with a haughty attitude. &#xA0;Without unsheathing the enormous sword, the Frost Knight hit the ground with its sheathe.</span></p><p><span style="">Including the Bone Spear Hyrkan had just thrown, there were 7 total spears stuck in the Frost Knight&apos;s body.</span></p><p><span style="">It was embedded in its armor. &#xA0;It seemed the Frost Knight hadn&apos;t felt the need to move. &#xA0;It didn&apos;t pay an ounce of attention to them as the Bone Spears stuck in its body. &#xA0;It was treating the Bone Spears as if they were decorations for its armor.</span></p><p><span style="">The Frost Knight hit the ground ground again.</span></p><p><span style="">Koohng! </span></p><p><span style="">The sheathed sword hit the ground consecutively.</span></p><p><span style="">Boo-doo-doohk! </span></p><p><span style="">The Bone Spears stuck on its body froze, and it crumbled away.</span></p><p><span style="">Koohng! </span></p><p><span style="">The ground rang out for the third time. &#xA0;A crack formed on the sheath.</span></p><p><span style="">A crack shaped like a lightning formed on the sword sheathe, and the crack started to thicken.</span></p><p><span style="">Koohng! </span></p><p><span style="">The ground rang out for the fourth time, and it was the last time it rang out. One could see through the crack of the sheath, and a thick fog started seeping out.</span></p><p><span style="">The first to react to the fog was the Cursed slaves.</span></p><p><span style="">Boo-roo-roo! </span></p><p><span style="">They had been fighting, but they unconsciously started to shake. &#xA0;In such a tight battle, it was basically suicide to tremble like this! </span></p><p><span style="">The Skeleton Warriors didn&apos;t miss the opening created by the shaking enemies. &#xA0;The Skeleton Warriors didn&apos;t even need to think about their actions.</span></p><p><span style="">The only one that had to think was a single User.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;It&apos;s coming.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan clenched his fist as if he had expected this. &#xA0;Clear droplets of liquid fell through his clench fist. </span></p><p><span style="">Clay Play! </span></p><p><span style="">However, it happened before Hyrkan could complete his summoning.</span></p><p><span style="">Poo-hwaht! </span></p><p><span style="">The Frost Knight&apos;s sheath broke into pieces, and the extreme cold that was sleeping within it for all these years exploded forth.</span></p><p><span style="">[The Frost Fog is spreading quickly.] </span></p><p><span style="">Hweeeeee! </span></p><p><span style="">The Frost Fog was so powerful that a System Warning was given. &#xA0;The Frost Fog ate up the battlefield in an instant.</span></p><p><span style="">Everything was frozen as all stood still. &#xA0;All kinds of sounds had been emitted from the fierce battle a moment ago, but the fierce scene of battle was frozen in place. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">The unfathomable silence replaced the fierceness of battle.</span></p><p><span style="">It was as if one&#x2019;s goose bumps had frozen by this sight.</span></p><p><span style="">The first one to disturb this scene was Hyrkan. &#xA0;Hyrkan had frozen in place with his fist clenched.</span></p><p><span style="">Boo-doohk! </span></p><p><span style="">He started thawing, and the ice started to crumble away.</span></p><p><span style="">When his fist appeared, it was like a domino effect. &#xA0;The ice around Hyrkan&apos;s body started to break away.</span></p><p><span style="">When the ice had all shattered away, Hyrkan opened his fist. &#xA0;A Phoenix appeared out of Hyrkan&apos;s hand.</span></p><p><span style="">To be precise, it was a level 170 Boss Monster called the Big Bird.</span></p><p><span style="">It had a massive body, yet the bird boasted even bigger wings. &#xA0;It had the power to send enemies flying with its terrifying wingbeats. &#xA0;It was the most difficult Boss Monster in the same rank category!</span></p><p><span style="">The Big Bird appeared with a body that was burning.</span></p><p><span style="">As soon as it appeared, it started flapping its wings. &#xA0;Accompanying its wingbeats, a wind of flame overtook the frozen battlefield. &#xA0;It melted the frozen time, and the battle started up again.</span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan, who hadn&apos;t done anything up until now, started to run.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;The 2nd Phase has started.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">This was the second problem posed by the Frost Knight. &#xA0;He pierced through the Frost Fog.</span></p><p><span style="">In the early runs in the past, numerous Users were unable to do anything against this attack. &#xA0;They suffered the attack with their eyes open. &#xA0;While the Users were frozen, they suffered blows from the Frost Knight&apos;s sword. &#xA0;He had just broken through the calamity faced by those Users.</span></p><p><span style="">The solving of this problem was good news. &#xA0;However, at the same time, it meant he would be posed with a new problem from the Frost Knight.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;I have to do this immediately.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">Finally, Hyrkan summoned the two Skeleton Knights for the first time in this battle. &#xA0;When the Skeleton Knights appeared, the tide of the battle changed 180 degrees. </span></p><p><span style="">[The Special Ability &apos;Chivalry&apos; has activated.] </span></p><p><span style="">[The Special Ability &apos;Commander&apos; has activated.] </span></p><p><span style="">The tide of the battle turned overwhelmingly in favor of the Skeleton Warriors when the Skeleton Knights appeared.</span></p><p><span style="">On top of it all, the appearance of Big Bird Fire Golem had decreased the defense of the Cursed slaves. &#xA0;Since the Skeleton Warriors had gotten stronger compared to a moment ago, the Cursed slaves were helpless.</span></p><p><span style="">Moreover, the Skeleton Knights started to attack in a frenzied manner.</span></p><p><span style="">One of the Skeleton Knights was equipped with the Great Battle Hero&apos;s Sword. &#xA0;This particular Skeleton Knight was the definition of being overpowered.</span></p><p><span style="">Puh-uhk!</span></p><p><span style="">When the sword came down on the hardened skin of the Cursed slave, it didn&apos;t let out a sharp sound. &#xA0;It let out out a dull sound as the Cursed slave was broken into pieces.</span></p><p><span style="">Critical blow! </span></p><p><span style="">This was a more frightening sight then the enemies being sliced open.</span></p><p><span style="">The Skeleton Knights were making a path. &#xA0;When one Knight seemed to be slowing down, the Skeleton Knight with the Great Battle Hero&apos;s Sword took over to quickly clear the path. &#xA0;They were making a path towards the Frost Knight, and at the end of the road, the Frost Knight was standing there.</span></p><p><span style="">The Frost Knight was almost 4 meters tall. &#xA0;The Skeleton Knights were almost 3 meters tall. &#xA0;They stood facing each other.</span></p><p><span style="">At that moment, white bone started to encase the Skeleton Knight&apos;s body.</span></p><p><span style="">Bone Armor! </span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Just last 1 minute.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan activated more power, so the Skeleton Knights could face off against the enemy.</span></p><p><span style="">He summoned their horns. &#xA0;He didn&apos;t forget to activate the Madness Helm. &#xA0;The Skeleton Knights were encased in Bone Armor, and the tell-tale sign of the Madness Helm appeared as a horn on their skulls. &#xA0;The Skeleton Knights opened their mouths wide as they displayed their ferocious nature. &#xA0;They raised their swords at the same time to attack the Frost Knight.</span></p><p><span style="">Of course, the Frost Knight swung its sword to block the attacks.</span></p><p><span style="">It was a collision between swords.</span></p><p><span style="">Ggoo-roong! </span></p><p><span style="">It should have sounded like steel clashing, but it came out as loud thunderclaps.</span></p><p><span style="">Each attack had a huge effect on the participants. &#xA0;It was as if there were springs attached to the swords. &#xA0;Every sword swung by either the Skeleton Knights or the Frost Knight was bounced backward after the impact.</span></p><p><span style="">This was why the battle was slow.</span></p><p><span style="">Ggwah-roong! </span></p><p><span style="">After a single clash, one had to resist using one&apos;s strength. &#xA0;Then one had to attack after resetting one&#x2019;s stance.</span></p><p><span style="">Ggwah-roong! </span></p><p><span style="">They once again attacked each other in terms of strength. &#xA0;Each strike made one take a deep breath twice.</span></p><p><span style="">This was how powerful these strikes were. &#xA0;They were exchanging blows that had all their strengths behind it. &#xA0;It was hair-raising to approach this melee! </span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Ok!&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">It was a hair-raising display where one would be remiss to even stick one&apos;s hand in there. &#xA0;However, someone dared to push his body into the fray.</span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan! </span></p><p><span style="">He had already moved behind the Frost Knight, and he sprung towards the Frost Knight&apos;s back.</span></p><p><span style="">Kwah-jeek! </span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan&apos;s sword pierced the exact center of Frost Knight&apos;s back.</span></p><p><span style="">Choo-roo-roo! </span></p><p><span style="">At that moment, the Crying Sword let out a sad cry. &#xA0;It was as if it was lamenting that fact that it had met a crazy owner. &#xA0;It sounded as it was grumbling. &#xA0;However, Hyrkan ignored the grumbles as he worked against the Frost Knight&apos;s movements. &#xA0;He made a scar on the back plate of the Frost Knight&apos;s armor.</span></p><p><span style="">Then he immediately put a Bone Spear through the scar.</span></p><p><span style="">The Skeleton Knights and the Frost Knight had exchanged 7 strikes up to this point. &#xA0;The Frost Knight&apos;s sword had already crushed the Skeleton Knight&apos;s Bone Armor, and it had even dented the armor underneath it. &#xA0;After the 1 minute Hyrkan had wanted passed, the Frost Knight looked like a hedgehog.</span></p><p><span style="">The surprising part was the fact that the Frost Knight didn&apos;t pay any attention to Hyrkan during his work.</span></p><p><span style="">It was a loophole.</span></p><p><span style="">The Frost Knight didn&apos;t register any attacks on its armor unless it exceeded a certain threshold of damage. &#xA0;This was the loophole.</span></p><p><span style="">It had an innate arrogance and it was a near immortal. &#xA0;It died without knowing the pain of death, and this loophole was developed through these confluence of characteristics.</span></p><p><span style="">It was a loophole found through the sacrifice of over 10 Stormhunters guild members.</span></p><p><span style="">After finishing his attack using the loophole, he looked at his Skeleton Knights.</span></p><p><span style="">The Bone Armor hadn&apos;t held up. &#xA0;Moreover, the damage to the Skeleton Knight&apos;s defensive gears were quite significant.</span></p><p><span style="">However, the Skeleton Knights still showed the willingness to fight on. &#xA0;They showed Hyrkan that they could go on.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Thank you.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">The Skeleton Knights had performed well above expectation, so he thanked the bedraggled Skeleton Knights.</span></p><p><span style="">He put his thanks into motion. &#xA0;Hyrkan used the Bone Spears as handholds, and he started performing a job only he could do.</span></p><p><span style="">This was a job that couldn&apos;t be done by the Skeleton Warriors, Skeleton Knights and the Golem. &#xA0;He started the Armor Breaking, which was a job that could only be done by Hyrkan.</span></p><p><span style="">Choo-roong! </span></p><p><span style="">This time the Crying Sword let out a cry of joy. &#xA0;The Crying Sword was the best at taking off enemy&apos;s tough scales, leather or carapace. &#xA0;It was something the sword enjoyed doing!</span></p><p><span style="">The Crying Sword started to dismantle the Frost Knight&apos;s armor in a short amount of time.</span></p><p><span style="">It was the result of giving a master calligrapher the best possible brush to use.</span></p><p><span style="">As its owner did its job, the Skeleton Knights continued to fight hard until the end. &#xA0;At the two minute mark, a Skeleton Knight had lost its left arm. &#xA0;When the battle reached the 3 minute mark, they were in terrible shape. &#xA0;&#xA0;The demise of the Skeleton Knights looked inevitable. &#xA0;In the end, the Skeleton Knights had lasted three times longer than Hyrkan had expected.</span></p><p><span style="">Of course, Hyrkan was also working well above expectation as if to reward the earlier efforts of the Skeleton Knights. &#xA0;The Frost Knight&apos;s anger started to flow out of the cracked armor.</span></p><p><span style="">[The cold energy that can never be broken is flowing over you.] </span></p><p><span style="">[All Stats will be decreased.] </span></p><p><span style="">[You will suffer from terrifying frostbites.] </span></p><p><span style="">This freezing air pretty much repelled anyone close to the Frost Knight. &#xA0;Even the Ifrit&apos;s Essence wouldn&apos;t let one resist against this cold air.</span></p><p><span style="">Of course, one couldn&apos;t resist against the cold air using will power or stubbornness. &#xA0;If one unwisely choose to resist against it, the User would inevitably be frozen to death by the cold air!</span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan had experienced this for the first time, but he was fully aware of the effect of this attack. &#xA0;Therefore, he put distance with the cold air. &#xA0;However, the Skeleton Knights froze over as they could evade it.</span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan couldn&#x2019;t continue watching his noble Skeleton Knights.</span></p><p><span style="">Koo-oohng! </span></p><p><span style="">When Hyrkan distanced himself, the Frost Knight erected an enormous ice wall. &#xA0;This wall completely cut off the Frost Knight from the battlefield. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">This was different from the ice walls he had seen several times before. &#xA0;This wall looked to have been carved. &#xA0;There were shaped carved into the wall. &#xA0;It was as if various monsters, elves, dwarves and humans were trying to escape hell. &#xA0;This image was willing up the wall.</span></p><p><span style="">[The Wall of Agony has appeared.] </span></p><p><span style="">[The Frost Knight&apos;s power is recovering across the Wall of Agony.] </span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Third Phase.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">This was the third problem that was posed to him. &#xA0;It was the appearance of the Wall of Agony.</span></p><p><span style="">This wall boasted an incredible amount of defense. &#xA0;On top of it all, the wall had a special property that it didn&apos;t accumulate damage.</span></p><p><span style="">One had to break through it using a single blow.</span></p><p><span style="">As he looked at this door, Hyrkan took out a card he had prepared. He took out a single gem, and he gripped it.</span></p><p><span style="">Ddoohk ddoohk! </span></p><p><span style="">The gem that had melted in Hyrkan&apos;s hand dripped to the frozen ground, and a Golem was awakened.</span></p><p><span style="">The Earth Golem appeared in the shape of an enormous rhinoceros.</span></p><p><span style="">It was 5 meters long! &#xA0;The frightening part was the incredibly large horn that was as big as its body. &#xA0;The enormous horn was a weapon that was used to crush castle gates. It reminded one of a battering ram.</span></p><p><span style="">Cast Iron Rhinoceros! </span></p><p><span style="">It was a level 180 Boss Monster. &#xA0;It possessed a variety of nicknames. &#xA0;It was called the Slaughterer of Tankers. &#xA0;The Tankers hated this monster the most. The second nickname&#x2026;&#x2026; The most popular amongst the nickname was Tankerbell! &#xA0;It rang the Tankers like a bell.</span></p><p><span style="">It was a Boss Monster that gave out expensive Items. &#xA0;In terms of worth, it was within the top 10. &#xA0;Of course, the ingredients that came out from this monster was used to make Rare and Epic Items. &#xA0;At the very least, these ingredients were sold for 5000 gold.</span></p><p><span style="">However, it was well worth the money considering the attack it would perform.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Go!&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">As soon as Hyrkan&apos;s yell ended, the Cast Iron Rhinoceros charged towards the Wall of Agony.</span></p><p><span style="">Koong, kwahng, koong, kwahng! </span></p><p><span style="">The ground shook as it ran.</span></p><p><span style="">Koong koong koong! </span></p><p><span style="">It accelerated in a flash.</span></p><p><span style="">The Cast Iron Rhinoceros was running at incredible speeds. &#xA0;Its large body looked ungainly, but it was flying across the ground as swift as a swallow.</span></p><p><span style="">In the end, the Cast Iron Rhinoceros&apos; horn collided with the Wall of Agony.</span></p><p><span style="">Ggwahhhhhhng! </span></p><p><span style="">All the sound up until this point couldn&apos;t compare to this sound. &#xA0;It swept across the battlefield.</span></p><p><span style="">For a brief moment, Hyrkan was tense.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Break through.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">He was most unsure of this part of the plan.</span></p><p><span style="">The Stormhunters guild had shown the level of attack one needed against the Wall of Agony.</span></p><p><span style="">That level&#x2026;&#x2026; It had to be a level 190 or above Magician or Striker. &#xA0;One needed to be equipped with Epic Items, and one also needed a full set of Buffs. &#xA0;On top of it all, one had to use a level 180 or above skill with burst damage! </span></p><p><span style="">If one considered these requirements, the Storm Queen Shir, Chev or Sinclair would be able to break the Wall of Agony.</span></p><p><span style="">However, Hyrkan couldn&apos;t produce such a large amount of damage in such a short amount of time.</span></p><p><span style="">This was the next best plan he could come up with. &#xA0;Since this was the next best plan, there was no guarantee that it would work.</span></p><p><span style="">Since he couldn&apos;t guarantee it would work, he couldn&apos;t help, but feel restless. &#xA0;&#xA0;He kept feeling the restlessness after he heard the huge boom.</span></p><p><span style="">[The Wall of Agony has fallen.] </span></p><p><span style="">However, when he heard the System Announcement, Hyrkan put on the same smile he had on in the beginning of the battle.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;This is the finale.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">At that moment, Hyrkan was holding a pouch.</span></p><p><span style="">Each of this Bone Ingredients were worth 500 gold. &#xA0;These were made from the highest level Boss Monster available. &#xA0;The Bone Ingredients were from the Magma Giant, and it was the best Bone Explosive he could make.</span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan ran towards the fallen Wall of Agony, and he threw all the explosives towards the Frost Knight.</span></p><p><span style="">Too-doo-doohk! </span></p><p><span style="">There were around 20 Bone Explosive thrown, and it rolled across the ground before they came to a stop beneath the Frost Knight&apos;s feet.</span></p><p><span style="">Kwah-gwah-gwah-gwahng! </span></p><p><span style="">The sound of the explosions were heard, and the Frost Knight&apos;s armor started to crack within this explosion.</span></p><p><span style="">In a flash, there weren&apos;t any Cursed slaves left. &#xA0;There was only the Frost Knight left, and there were no obstacles or barriers between them.</span></p><p><span style="">He had one Skeleton Knight, 17 Skeleton Warriors, two Skeleton Magicians, the Big Bird Fire Golem and the Rhinoceros Golem left. &#xA0;They all stared at a single opponent.</span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan didn&apos;t even hesitate. &#xA0;He gave them consent.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Kill it!&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">There was only one problem left to solve.</span></p><p>2.</p><p><span style="">Once the armor came off, Hyrkan&apos;s damage dealing was overwhelming.</span></p><p><span style="">Even if the numerous Skeleton Warriors got a single blow in, it was as if several dozen Strikers attacking it. &#xA0;Powerful attacks were executed by the Golems, and the Skeleton Knights displayed their frightening capabilities. &#xA0;The Frost Knight also couldn&apos;t ignore the attacks from the Skeleton Magicians. &#xA0;On top of that, the power of the Bone Spears and Bone Explosives gave one goosebumps.</span></p><p><span style="">If one saw Hyrkan&apos;s battle, this person would describe it was as if a swarm of bullet ants in the Amazon jungle was attacking its prey. &#xA0;It was akin to the scary bullet ants that could take chunks out animal flesh that was several dozen times bigger than the ants.</span></p><p><span style="">Amongst this swarm of ants, Hyrkan was like a scorpion striking.</span></p><p><span style="">Since he had reached the last phase of the Frost Knight Raid, he decided to go all out.</span></p><p><span style="">[The Black Heart&apos;s effect has activated.] </span></p><p><span style="">Black Heart was the skill that he had acquired at a high cost!</span></p><p><span style="">It was a skill one used if one had a surplus of magic. &#xA0;He used the skill at that moment.</span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan&apos;s physical ability was pushed well beyond the best Strikers in Warlord. &#xA0;His Strength stat was drastically increased, and this was the first time seeing Hyrkan with an overclocked Stat. &#xA0;Hyrkan started moving like a madman. &#xA0;The Frost Knight was fending off the small fries when Hyrkan saw an opening. He flew in on his target like a dart.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Damn you!&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">A despaired filled voice escaped the arrogant Frost Knight.</span></p><p><span style="">It happened as the despair-filled sound continued.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;This is the price for interfering with him. &#xA0;Your life isn&apos;t enough!&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Its voice changed into a curse.</span></p><p><span style="">It happened in an instant.</span></p><p><span style="">There was no warning. &#xA0;After the curse was put out, the Frost Knight&apos;s body exploded.</span></p><p><span style="">[The Frost Dragon&apos;s Curse has begun.] </span></p><p><span style="">The terrifying curse that had created the Frozen Kingdom swept over the battlefield.</span></p><p><span style="">This was the final act shown by the Frost Knight. &#xA0;There had been no signs that this last-ditch effort was coming.</span></p><p><span style="">The powerful curse froze the Skeleton Warriors, Knights, Magicians and the Golems.</span></p><p><span style="">It didn&apos;t end there.</span></p><p><span style="">Everything that was frozen started to crumble away. &#xA0;The Undead army, which had been filling the battle field, crumbled away into crumbs of ice. &#xA0;They were turned into piles of ice like a sand dune atop the frozen ground.</span></p><p><span style="">Of course, Hyrkan was also frozen in place. &#xA0;It was as if Hyrkan was an ice sculpture. &#xA0;If this Raid was being broadcasted live, the chatting window would be filled with groans.</span></p><p><span style="">As if to make this worse, the underlings in front of Hyrkan was starting to crack.</span></p><p><span style="">As they started to crack, they started being turned into a pile of ice shavings.</span></p><p><span style="">However, as everything was crumbling away, Hyrkan appeared once again.</span></p><p><span style="">[The Circlet of Purification protected you from the Frost Dragon&apos;s Curse.] </span></p><p><span style="">He had already switched his Item beforehand. &#xA0;Hyrkan spoke with a smile on his face.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;That&apos;s a wrap.&#x201D;</span></p>
