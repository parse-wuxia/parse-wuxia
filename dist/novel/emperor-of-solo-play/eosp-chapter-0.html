So I couldn&#x2019;t say anything whenever I was called trash. That isn&#x2019;t to say I never struggled to become better. But at the end of the day, I fell asleep kicking the bed sheets in anger.</p><p>This goddamned life.</p><p>But for the first time, I found something I was better at than others.</p><p>Virtual reality (VR) games!</p><p>In real life, I was at the bottom of the food chain. But in the virtual world, I was at the top. Even the so called professional-gamers were mere preys in my eyes.</p><p>To top it off, you could gain unimaginable wealth and prestige just by being good at gaming. This was the era of VR games.</p><p>I had no hesitation.</p><p>To succeed through gaming, I was prepared to give my life. I did anything to accomplish my goals. Everything was fair in the name of success.</p><p>In the end, the goal I&#x2019;ve been striving for was within my reach, just a hair&#x2019;s breadth away.</p><p>Just a bit more, just a bit!</p><p>I could have reached my goal in just a bit more&#x2026;</p><p>&#x201C;Fuckers.&#x201D;</p><p>I never thought my comrades would betray me. The ones I thought would stay by my side until the end.</p><p>&#x201C;Fuck.&#x201D;</p><p>My comrades betrayed me, and in an instant, four years of hard work disappeared into the void.</p><p>I tried to fight back, but I was powerless. A hole had been pierced through my stomach, and I even developed sociophobia.</p><p>&#x201C;See if I trust anyone ever again.&#x201D;</p><p>When I was given a chance to start over, I knew what path to take.</p><p>&#x201C;Whatever the outcome, I&#x2019;ll do it alone&#x2026; I&#x2019;ll show you that I can do it alone.&#x201D;</p><p>The Solo Path!</p><p>This is how I&#x2019;ve come to tread this road.</p><hr><p style="text-align: center">&lt;~ Previous Chapter | &#xA0;|</p><p></p><p></p></div><p></p>
