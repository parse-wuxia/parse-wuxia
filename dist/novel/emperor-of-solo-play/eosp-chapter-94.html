<p><span style="">Chapter 94 - Waltz (1)</span></p><p><span style="">Ddahk ddahk ddahk! </span></p><p><span style="">Every time the chin of the Skeleton Magician moved, it clacked. &#xA0;It was as if a crazy magician was laughing.</span></p><p><span style="">Accompanying the bizarre laughter, the Skeleton Magician threw a big fireball. &#xA0;It flew quickly through the air in an arc. &#xA0;At the end of the arc, the body of the Corrupted Comrade was present. &#xA0;The size of its body had decreased significantly.</span></p><p><span style="">Puh-uhng! </span></p><p><span style="">When the fireball reached the target, it exploded. &#xA0;Accompanying the explosion, the flame blew apart into sparks of flame, and they stuck to the Corrupted Comrade&apos;s body. </span></p><p><span style="">Hwah-roo-roo.... </span></p><p><span style="">Up until now, the flames had quickly extinguished itself. However, the flames continued to burn, and it let its presence be known.</span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan was watching all of this from a nearby location. &#xA0;He gripped his sword as he stood 2 meters away. &#xA0;Hyrkan lowered the point of his sword towards the ground instead of pointing it towards the Corrupted Comrade.</span></p><p><span style="">Battle Complete. </span></p><p><span style="">However, Hyrkan didn&apos;t let go of his feeling of tension.</span></p><p><span style="">He still hadn&apos;t heard the announcement. &#xA0;There weren&apos;t any announcement indicating that his Quest had been completed, and he hadn&apos;t received any Titles. &#xA0;This meant the battle was over, but the instance wasn&apos;t at an end.</span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan looked at the Corrupted Comrade, and he stood vigilant of his surrounding.</span></p><p><span style="">More time passed, and nothing special was happening.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Whew!&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan was finally able to let out a short sigh. When he let out the sigh, his mind had some available space to think.</span></p><p><span style="">The available space was occupied by idle thoughts. </span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Tsk.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan&apos;s idle thoughts were filled with self-reflection.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;I got hit twice.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">He took out a candy from a secret pocket located near his chest, and he put the candy into his mouth. &#xA0;There were various spots on his clothes that was blackened. This was the trace left behind after he was hit by the Skeleton Magician&apos;s magic.</span></p><p><span style="">He hadn&apos;t been hit by the full brunt of the magic spell. &#xA0;When the fireball exploded after hitting the Corrupted Comrade, the sparks of flame had hit him. &#xA0;This was what had left behind the marks on his clothes.</span></p><p><span style="">It was hard to see this as a big problem. &#xA0;The clothes worn by Hyrkan was a Defensive Set made from of the Clear Spider&apos;s webs. &#xA0;It wasn&apos;t an item that could be destroyed by such minor damage. &#xA0;To be truthful, he hadn&apos;t taken much damage. &#xA0;Moreover, it had been necessary for him to stick to the Corrupted Comrade, so the amount of damage he suffered was inevitable.</span></p><p><span style="">It wasn&apos;t something that should make him take time for self-reflection.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;I&apos;ll have to practice a little bit more.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">However, Hyrkan was still not satisfied with this battle, so corner of his mouth drooped.</span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan chewed on the candy as he had an introspection. &#xA0;The flame that had been burning the Corrupted Comrade&apos;s body started to subside. &#xA0;When the flames died down, its muscular body was gone. &#xA0;Hyrkan saw a skinny body that was akin to a skeleton.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Thank you.,&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">It was burnt black, and an unpleasant voice emanated from the skeletal body.</span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan realized what was happening, so he moved closer to the Corrupted Comrade.</span></p><p><span style="">When Hyrkan approached the Corrupted Comrade, it spoke while standing upright.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Thank you from freeing me from this pain.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan took off his glove. &#xA0;He spoke as he displayed his golden ring, the Proof of the Secret Society.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ah, you are&#x2026;&#x2026;.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Its eyes were already burnt black, so it was impossible to see Hyrkan through its naked eye. &#xA0;However, the Corrupted Comrade had no problem identifying Hyrkan. &#xA0;As with the other NPCs, it could sense the distinctive energy emitted by the Secret Society&apos;s ring.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Please take my keepsakes to Maeung. &#xA0;Then.... &#xA0;Tell Maeung that he was right. &#xA0;Please deliver those words for me.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">After he spoke those words, the Corrupted Comrade dropped to his knees. &#xA0;This was the first time the Corrupted Comrade had fallen to his knees.</span></p><p><span style="">Pshhhhhhh! </span></p><p><span style="">Then he started to disintegrate into ashes.</span></p><p><span style="">[Quest &apos;Elf&apos;s Keepsake&apos; has been completed.] </span></p><p><span style="">[The Quest &#x2018;Will of a Comrade&#x2019; has started.] </span></p><p><span style="">The Quest Announcement immediately popped up.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Great.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">He could wrap this up.</span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan released the built up tension.</span></p><p><span style="">[You&apos;ve earned the title &#x2018;Destroyer of Corruption.] </span></p><p><span style="">However, Hyrkan became tense once again.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Uh?&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">Something unexpected had happened.</span></p><p><span style="">The thick blue fog made it hard to see even an object right in front of their noses. &#xA0;Five users walked together through the blue fog.</span></p><p><span style="">It seemed this group had gone through several battles already. &#xA0;Their clothes were a bit rumpled.</span></p><p><span style="">On the other hand, that was a huge accomplishment. &#xA0;This place wasn&apos;t an easy to place to fight. &#xA0;They had fought several battles within the Blue Mist Forest, yet only their clothes were rumpled. &#xA0;This meant they hadn&apos;t taken much damage. &#xA0;It was evidence that their skills and levels were extraordinary.</span></p><p><span style="">The five of them came across a boulder that could be used as a chair within the thick fog. For a brief moment, they slightly relaxed as they started a conversation.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;It really is hard to hunt here.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;How can there be so many monsters here? &#xA0;No matter how I think about it, this is an abnormal amount of monsters. &#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Even though there used to to be a Block Field here, there is a good reason why the Users aren&apos;t flocking to this place. &#xA0;This place is the worst as a hunting ground.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Doesn&apos;t that make it more appealing as a place to conduct the Sweep?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Sweep. </span></p><p><span style="">If one overheard this word, anyone could discern their identities.</span></p><p><span style="">Sweepers! </span></p><p><span style="">The five of them were part of the Sweepers guild. &#xA0;They were an advance party sent to investigate the location they were going to do a full-scale cleaning.</span></p><p><span style="">Their average level was 130. &#xA0;They all possessed high level, and they were masters at survival. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">Moreover, they were outstanding at evaluating monsters.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Will it be possible for us to Sweep this place? The level of the monsters seem quite high?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;But isn&apos;t their Health and Defense weak? &#xA0;I&apos;ll be an easy Sweep. &#xA0;The problem is whether we will be able to take footage in this place.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I guess the fog is a bit much here.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;How about clearing the fog with the Wind type magic? &#xA0;We can push away all the fog then we can commence our magical bombardment. &#xA0;Wouldn&apos;t that make a great vid?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Bring a magician here to check if it&apos;ll work.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Anyways, it&apos;ll be hard for a small party to hunt here. &#xA0;At least, we confirmed that. &#xA0;There is no way anyone is hunting here.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">They were holding a conversation to get rid of their nervousness when it happened.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Prepare for battle!&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">One of the user hadn&apos;t been participating in the conversation. &#xA0;The user, who had been keeping watch, suddenly let out a yell.</span></p><p><span style="">The party members immediately got into their battle stance when they heard the shout. &#xA0;The Tankers stepped forward, and the Priest got his Heal magic ready. &#xA0;Moreover, they were cautious. &#xA0;They didn&apos;t try for pre-emptive attack. &#xA0;No matter what happened, they were confident that they&apos;ll be able to cope with the situation. &#xA0;They were veterans affiliated with one of the 30 great guilds.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Huh?&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Uh?&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">The being that was approaching them was most definitely a user.</span></p><p><span style="">They could see a rough outline of the figure, but it was completely different from the shape of a Smogrian. If one considered the sight one could actually make out, there were plenty evidence that suggested that the person in front of them wasn&apos;t a Smogrian. &#xA0;The Smogrians had a similar coloring to the blue fog, so one couldn&apos;t see it unless it was really close to a user.</span></p><p><span style="">The deciding factor was how fast this being was approaching them. &#xA0;When this user discovered the Sweepers guild members, he stopped. &#xA0;Only a user would stop when one sees another user.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Who the hell hunts in this place?&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">Moreover, the user was alone.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Crazy!&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;He&apos;s hunting by himself here?&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">The five users had a dazed expression on their face.</span></p><p><span style="">Eventually, the distance between them narrowed. &#xA0;The two sides were close enough to be able to see each other&apos;s faces.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hahoe Mask?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Someone spoke.</span></p><p><span style="">A reply came immediately.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Which guild are you affiliated with?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">It was a pretty unfriendly answer. &#xA0;It was a non-answer, and that point couldn&#x2019;t be argued.</span></p><p><span style="">He didn&apos;t even confirm his identity, yet he asked for their affiliation. &#xA0;They couldn&apos;t consider his words to be a proper answer.</span></p><p><span style="">However, the Sweepers guild members answered without making any fuss.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;We are affiliated with the Sweepers guild.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">At that moment, Hahoe Mask finally came fully into view. &#xA0;Hyrkan asked the five users a question.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Did the Monster Sweep already start? &#xA0;When I saw the announcement, it said the Sweep would be starting five days from today.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;We are the advance party.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">After a brief conversation, the two sides looked at each other.</span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan&apos;s appearance was bizarre in the eyes of the Sweepers guild members. &#xA0;The most striking part of his appearance was the big bag he was carrying. &#xA0;It was a large duffel bag that a soldier might use. &#xA0;The bag looked as if it was about to burst.</span></p><p><span style="">It was evident that the bag was filled with Ingredient Coins. As members of the Sweepers guild, they were well aware of this fact.</span></p><p><span style="">This was why their surprise was much larger.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;My god. He really was hunting here?&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;By himself?&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">The number of Ingredient Coin was basically the number of monsters Hyrkan had taken down.</span></p><p><span style="">They were beyond being impressed. The Sweeper Guild members were shocked.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Incredible.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Recently, I heard the 30 great guilds were competing with each other to recruit him. &#xA0;I now understand why.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">The five of them were still trying to process their surprise when it happened.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Then I&apos;ll&#x2026;&#x2026;.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan was about to leave, but he stopped as if he just remembered something.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Ah.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">Soooohk! </span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan extended his hand towards them. &#xA0;He wasn&apos;t asking for a handshake. &#xA0;He had his palm up as he extended his hand. &#xA0;If he wanted a handshake, he would have extended his hand straight.</span></p><p><span style="">The Sweepers guild members were confused as they looked at his palm.</span></p><p><span style="">What was the meaning of this?</span></p><p><span style="">Then doubt started to creep into their expression. &#xA0;Hyrkan gave a curt explanation.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I&apos;m retreating since I saw the Sweeper guild&apos;s Announcement to clean this place. Don&apos;t I qualify for the compensation?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">The Sweeper guild members put on awkward smiles at his words.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;My god.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;If he sold the the Ingredient Coins he has right now, won&apos;t he be able to gain several thousand gold in return?&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">He was probably making a lot of money from the views he got on his videos. &#xA0;It was an amount of money that a regular person couldn&apos;t even dream about making. &#xA0;This was the first time the Sweepers guild members met Hyrkan, so they were also having a hard time imagining it.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Are you perhaps saying one of the 30 great guilds is going back on their word?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan spoke again, and his words were strict, earnest, and serious.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I&apos;m in a hurry, so it would be great if you can settle the account right now.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">If he didn&apos;t immediately receive the compensation, it felt as if he was ready to make this situation bloody! &#xA0;That was the vibe he was giving off.</span></p><p><span style="">In the end, Hyrkan left after receiving 100 gold.</span></p><p><span style="">Ahn-jaehyun wordlessly stared at his Tablet PC. &#xA0;He was staring at a particular Item&apos;s Option.</span></p><p><span style="">He stared fixedly at the Tablet PC, and it seemed Ahn-jaehyun&apos;s vision became blurry. &#xA0;He turned his eyes away from the Tablet PC. &#xA0;He closed both his eyes, and he cover his face with both his hands. &#xA0;His eyes throbbed. </span></p><p><span style="">It was easy to read the Item&#x2019;s Option. &#xA0;If one knew Korean, even a child could read it. &#xA0;Ahn-jaehyun was overly knowledgeable regarding the game of Warlord, so he could understand the content just by glancing at the Stats.</span></p><p><span style="">This was the reason why he reacted this way.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Wow.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">Ahn-jaehyun knew the value of these Items better than anyone. He couldn&apos;t help, but be surprised.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;I never expected to get my hands on these items through such a method.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">These were the Items that made Ahn-jaehyun so surprised.</span></p><p><span style="">[Corruption Destroyer&apos;s Necklace] </span></p><p><span style="">*Main Properties </span></p><p><span style="">- Unique-rank Item</span></p><p><span style="">- Increases class-specific stats proportional to level</span></p><p><span style="">- All stats +33 </span></p><p><span style="">- Class related Stats +33 </span></p><p><span style="">- Chosen Stats +33 </span></p><p><span style="">- Required Level : 100 </span></p><p><span style="">- Required Condition: Title &#x2018;Corruption Destroyer&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">*Sub-properties</span></p><p><span style="">- When one wears items related to the Pursuer of Corruption, Destroyer and Arbiter, chosen Stats + 99</span></p><p><span style="">- When equipped, damage received is decreased by 10%.</span></p><p><span style="">- This item reverts to its owner. </span></p><p><span style="">*Miscellaneous</span></p><p><span style="">- It is a necklace for Corruption Destroyers, who resist against the power of Corruption. &#xA0;It holds a strong power.</span></p><p><span style="">[Member of Society, Ivan&apos;s Sword] </span></p><p><span style="">*Main Properties </span></p><p><span style="">- Unique-rank Item</span></p><p><span style="">- Strength +77 </span></p><p><span style="">- Stamina +66 </span></p><p><span style="">- Intelligence +55 </span></p><p><span style="">- Magic Power +44 </span></p><p><span style="">- Required Level : level 120 </span></p><p><span style="">- Required Condition : At least, 1000 points Strength </span></p><p><span style="">*Sub-properties</span></p><p><span style="">- When equipped, 15% of monster&apos;s defense is ignored</span></p><p><span style="">- When equipped, it is possible to use the Skill, &apos;Haste (C)&apos;. (Cool time 15 sec) </span></p><p><span style="">- This Item cannot be destroyed.</span></p><p><span style="">- This item reverts to its owner.</span></p><p><span style="">*Miscellaneous</span></p><p><span style="">- This is Ivan&apos;s Sword. &#xA0;He was a member of the Secret Society. &#xA0;As expected of a sword made by the Blacksmith Olf, it contains a strong power.</span></p><p><span style="">These were the two items left behind by the Corrupted Comrade. &#xA0;It was the Keepsakes left behind by Ivan.</span></p><p><span style="">He had to take the 3 Keepsakes to Maeung, which included the Secret Society&apos;s Ring. &#xA0;As the reward for the Quest, Maeung had given him this two items.</span></p><p><span style="">When he received the Items, Ahn-jaehyun was in a state of disbelief. He threw away the Pursuer of Corruption Necklace, and he equipped the Corruption Destroyer&apos;s Necklace. He stored the Ivan&apos;s Sword in his storage, since he couldn&apos;t equip it yet. &#xA0;Then he exited the game, and he had been staring at the two Item&apos;s Options until now!</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;I never expected such a jackpot to show up.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">Ahn-jaehyun had a hard time believing in his current situation.</span></p><p><span style="">He had gained incredible Items that was well beyond his expectations.</span></p><p><span style="">Ahn-jaehyun removed his hands from his face. &#xA0;He opened his closed eyes. &#xA0;It was hard to believe, but reality was reality.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;There is no reason to be flustered. There is no need to be worried.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">Ahn-jaehyun simplified his current situation.</span></p><p><span style="">He had been lucky, so he had gotten a Spec Up. Now he just had to use the Spec Up to his advantage to play the game.</span></p><p><span style="">No, he had to ride this momentum. </span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Yes, I have to keep this momentum going.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">Ahn-jaehyun&#xA0;had his savings and the money he received from his sponsors. &#xA0;He thought about his financial situation.</span></p><p><span style="">He worked hard to save his money, so he had a good amount of money saved.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;I have to burn it all.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">He hadn&#x2019;t used his money , since an unexpected situation could crop up in the future. Still, he hadn&apos;t been planning on spending the large sum of money.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;This is the time to let it all hang out.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">However, he had to build upon his momentum, so he would have to make a direct investment. It was time to spend his money even if his spending money for food decreased.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;I have to seriously invest in the defensive gear of my Skeletons.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">If he upgraded his Specs a little bit more, he would be able to hunt in level 140 hunting grounds at level 110.</span></p><p><span style="">Currently, the level 140 hunting ground could be considered the front lines right now. &#xA0;The number one ranking player, Perfect One, was at level 164. &#xA0;The top 100 Ranking started from level 152.</span></p><p><span style="">If he was going to hunt in the frontlines, he had to equip himself with the latest items. &#xA0;As always, the latest gears were the top-selling items.</span></p><p><span style="">Ahn-jaehyun made a fist.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Yes. &#xA0;I have to charge for my footages from now on. &#xA0;Then I&apos;ll be able to bring in the real jackpot when I sell my footages.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">He had to get a little bit more serious about bringing in more profit.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Wait, what should I do with the footage?&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">Ahn-jaehyun thought about the footage of him battling the Corrupted Comrade. &#xA0;When he gained the Corruption Destroyer Title, he hadn&apos;t been able to think of anything else. &#xA0;This was why he hadn&apos;t given any thoughts to his footage.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;At best, I don&apos;t think I&apos;ll be able to hit a million view with this...&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">Truthfully, the footage wasn&apos;t that appealing in the eyes of Ahn-jaehyun.</span></p><p><span style="">Hahoe Mask fans liked Hahoe Mask fighting a full-fledged battle with a monster. &#xA0;However, in this footage, he hadn&apos;t even attacked. &#xA0;He avoided, baited and danced.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;I guess I&apos;ll leave it to the Romani Films.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">Ahn-jaehyun thought about the Romani film company. If Ahn-jaehyun did a poor job editing the footage, he was sure his reputation would take a hit. &#xA0;This was why he needed help from a professional. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">Ahn-jaehyun prepared his video file, then he contacted the Romain film company.</span></p><p><span style="">The conversation was brief. &#xA0;It was as if they been waiting for Ahn-jaehyun to contact them. &#xA0;They happily accepted the job. &#xA0;When he sent the video file to the Romani film company, Ahn-jaehyun had a small wish.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;I hope there will be enough views to offset the cost.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">When the file was sent, any thoughts about the footage containing his fight with the Corrupted Comrade left his mind.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;What should I spend my money on? Shall I buy a staff that can be used by the Skeleton Magicians?&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">From that point on, his mind was filled with thought about equipping his Skeletons.</span></p>
