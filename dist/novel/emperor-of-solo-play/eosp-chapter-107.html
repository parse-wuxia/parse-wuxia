<p><span style="">Chapter 107 - Catacombs (2)</span></p><p><span style="">The familiars summoned by the Necromancers could be developed in such a way that they gained combat AI through battles.</span></p><p><span style="">This was especially effective if the familiars fought a large number of similar type monsters. &#xA0;Moreover, it would be best if one minimized the losses taken by the familiars in battle. &#xA0;As the familiar gains numerous victories against the monsters, their combat AI increases to an altogether different level.</span></p><p><span style="">This was why numerous Warlord Users mothballed their current character after seeing the Hahoe Mask&apos;s Skeletons. &#xA0;They had been tempted into growing a Necromancer.</span></p><p><span style="">The Necromancer didn&apos;t even need to command the familiars.</span></p><p><span style="">When a monster appeared in the big tunnel, the Skeleton Knight was the first one to face the enemy. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">While the Skeleton Knight was occupying the monster, Hyrkan threw one or two Skeleton Fragments to the other side of the Skeleton Knight and the monster. &#xA0;That was all he had to to do. This simple action allowed him to form a formation where his Skeleton underlings attacked from the front and the back.</span></p><p><span style="">Since the Skeletons were fighting one type of monster here, they had become specialist after fighting the same monsters several hundred times. &#xA0;The Skeleton Warriors and Skeleton Knight held the numerical advantage, and they were placed in advantageous positions by Hyrkan. &#xA0;The outcome of the battles were basically settled.</span></p><p><span style="">The one-sided battle continued to happen. &#xA0;It was so one-sided that Hyrkan didn&apos;t have the chance to do anything! It was so bad that he could take his eyes off the battle. &#xA0;He watched some unknown guild&apos;s Raid video.</span></p><p><span style="">In many ways, the Catacombs Dungeon was too ideal for Hyrkan.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Jeez! &#xA0;Really!&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">It would have been perfect except for one thing.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Why did another dead-end appear here! &#xA0;Why? What&apos;s the reason? I just want to go forward!&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">The Catacombs was a maze Dungeon.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ooh-ahhh. Really!&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan was pretty poor at finding the right route in the maze type Dungeon.</span></p><p><span style="">If it wasn&apos;t for this fact, the exploration of the Catacomb would have been like a vacation instead of work.</span></p><p><span style="">This one factor drove Hyrkan nuts. </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What are you looking at? Shut your mouth!&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">In the end, Hyrkan became hysterical towards the Skeleton Warrior, who was staring at him with its mouth open.</span></p><p><span style="">At that moment, the light within the Skeleton Warrior&apos;s eyes changed. &#xA0;The two globes within the socket of the skull started to burn.</span></p><p><span style="">Was the Skeleton Warrior resentful at being exploited? Was it angry towards its vicious master, who beat on it whenever he had a free time? &#xA0;Did the Skeleton finally snap?</span></p><p><span style="">Of course, that wasn&apos;t the case.</span></p><p><span style="">After the light within its eyes changed, the Skeleton Warrior immediately turned around. &#xA0;It looked towards its back. The light above the Skeleton Warrior&apos;s head illuminated the surrounding, and a Chimera Skeleton came into its view.</span></p><p><span style="">The Skeleton Warrior got ready to charge into battle.</span></p><p><span style="">However, Hyrkan moved before the Skeleton Warrior could move. &#xA0;Hyrkan raised Ivan&apos;s Sword, and he charged in towards the Chimera Skeleton before his Skeleton Warrior could get there. &#xA0;The battle started immediately.</span></p><p><span style="">The sword was hovering around the Chimera Skeleton like a satellite, and his constant sword swings crushed the Chimera Skeleton&apos;s armor. &#xA0;He broke its bones, and when a thick piece of bone was cut away, he tossed it far into the distance. &#xA0;The sight made one feel sorry for the Chimera Skeleton. &#xA0;The battle was that one-sided.</span></p><p><span style="">The battle reached its peak when Hyrkan was successful in stealing the Chimera Skeleton&apos;s skull. &#xA0;When he stole the skull, he let his Skeleton Warrior finish the battle, and he started to have fun by hitting the skull as if it was a bongo drum.</span></p><p><span style="">It had been a week since he had entered the Catacombs. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">This was a solution he had found, which relieved his hysteria.</span></p><p><span style="">[Those who Find the Wall] </span></p><p><span style="">- Stamina +2 </span></p><p><span style="">Recently he had gained a new Title. &#xA0;Ahn-jaehyun tightly closed his eyes when he saw it.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Shit. &#xA0;I received this one again.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">Those who Find the Wall.</span></p><p><span style="">In a maze type Dungeon, one acquired this title when one encounters a certain number of dead-ends.</span></p><p><span style="">The Title Option wasn&apos;t that great. These were Titles one could only gain when one finds a deadend. &#xA0;Users with time on their hands intentionally searched out deadends to gain these Titles.</span></p><p><span style="">On the other hand, when one received this title unintentionally, it caused anger instead of happiness.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;The Quest isn&apos;t progressing at all.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">This was the reason why Anh-jaehyun was mad.</span></p><p><span style="">In truth, the Catacombs Dungeon was Ahn-jaehyun&apos;s most optimal hunting ground. &#xA0;The EXP given was quite high, so the level up pace was very good. &#xA0;Moreover, the hunt wasn&apos;t difficult, so he barely used any consumable Items.</span></p><p><span style="">However, the Quest progress was basically stalled compared to the hunting speed.</span></p><p><span style="">The Catacomb Dungeon&apos;s maze was bigger than expected, and it was complicated. &#xA0;Moreover, the maze was pitch black, so it increased the difficulty of clearing the maze. &#xA0;On top of all of that, he had no clue on how to solve mazes. &#xA0;From Ahn-jaehyun&apos;s perspective, the maze was driving him crazy.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;I&apos;m sure Users, who are good at this kind of stuff, would have solved this immediately. &#xA0;Why is my luck so poor?&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">Of course, luck was a big factor in all of this. &#xA0;If he had luck on his side, he would be able to get past this place in a single breath.</span></p><p><span style="">This fact was evident by seeing the map of the Catacomb Dungeon that was being updated by Ahn-jaehyun. If a User was lucky, the maze map would look simple and fragmented.</span></p><p><span style="">However, Ahn-jaehyun&apos;s map was too detailed. &#xA0;He had run into too many walls, and he had marked all the dead-ends he had encountered. &#xA0;He had so many route marked that he could sell it later as a comprehensive map.</span></p><p><span style="">However, it just made Ahn-jaehyun&apos;s insides burn.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;This game is a real mother fucker.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">In the end, Ahn-jaehyun had to take an emergency measure to help his sour stomach. &#xA0;He didn&apos;t take a digestive medicine. &#xA0;He used a more sure-fire method. He checked the current summary of his bank account.</span></p><p><span style="">A happy smile formed around Ahn-jaehyun&apos;s lips when he saw the balance.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;My stomach feels full from just looking at this.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">With the help of his successful Waltz video, he was getting a constant stream of ad money and donations. He even received support fund from his recently signed sponsor. The amount was quite large.</span></p><p><span style="">If he wanted to, he could immediately leave his one room behind. He could probably find a 20-30 pyeong apartment near the metropolitan area. &#xA0;He would be able to purchase a small or medium sized apartment. He would also be able to buy a car with a lump sum.</span></p><p><span style="">However, Ahn-jaehyun&apos;s standards differed from others.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;If I save a little bit more, I can purchase a level 130 Unique defensive Set. &#xA0;Shall I buy it for my Skeleton Knight? &#xA0;No, it might be better to equip all my Skeleton Magicians with Unique Rank weapons. Should I purchase a Skill book? &#xA0;If the Skeleton Magicians can use the Dark Flame skill.... &#xA0;However, a single Skill book is worth 10,000 gold, and it is rarely put up on the market. &#xA0;Maybe it would be better if I just abandon that idea?&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">Ahn-jaehyun&apos;s thought about his happy &#xA0;troubles made him thirsty, so he opened his fridge. &#xA0;In a surprise, he decided to take out the milk carton. &#xA0;Ahn-jaehyun didn&apos;t even bother to pour the milk into a cup. &#xA0;He just drank it straight out of the carton.</span></p><p><span style="">The milk was more expensive than Ramen, but Ahn-jaehyun downed the whole thing. &#xA0;He smiled with a milk mustache on his face.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;This makes me feel like I&#x2019;ve been a bit successful.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">The milk helped erase the sensation of his insides burning. &#xA0;It disappeared like melting snow.</span></p><p><span style="">Ahn-jaehyun once again focused on the map on the Tablet PC. &#xA0;He calmly thought it over as he looked at the map.</span></p><p><span style="">&apos;I&apos;ve pretty much discovered every route. &#xA0;I just have to be patient. &#xA0;It&apos;ll be done soon. &#xA0;Yes, there is no reason why I have to get discouraged. &#xA0;You weren&apos;t wrong, Ahn-jaehyun.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">After regaining his calm, the light within Ahn-jaehyun&apos;s eyes became cold.</span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan noticed the definite change. &#xA0;He caught sight of a Chimera Skeleton wearing a different armor. &#xA0;It was very similar to the ones he had seen up until now, but Hyrkan didn&apos;t miss the clear difference.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;I finally get to see it.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan had searched for a difference, and he had found a faint emblem imprinted on the armor.</span></p><p><span style="">It was circular emblem, where three snakes were biting each other&apos;s tails! </span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;The three snakes are Prince Dean&apos;s Crest. &#xA0;I finally get to see it.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">In one viewed the world of Warlord, there was a faction, who had the most territory and the strongest forces. &#xA0;&#xA0;In the era of the monsters, the Hiban kingdom was at the frontline of fighting the monsters. &#xA0;When the third prince was born, castle of Bayan was given to the prince.</span></p><p><span style="">Before he was born, the great Archmage Bokan gave the prince a name. The name implied the prince would drive away the nightmare descending on the world with martyrs on his side. The name he had given was Dean. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">Moreover, as the father and king ruling over the Hiban kingdom, the prince was given the title of Un Northland. &#xA0;It meant he was the protector of the Northern lands.</span></p><p><span style="">Bayan Dean Un Northland.</span></p><p><span style="">Then the crest with the three snakes was bestowed on him. &#xA0;The three snakes was named Martial Arts, Wisdom and Destiny. &#xA0;He was symblolized as being the trigon prince.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;I&apos;ve finally arrived at the edge.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">When the power of Corruption left over by the Fallen Kingdom was found, Prince Dean sought to steal the throne with his new found power. &#xA0;He had conducted numerous evil deeds as he dreamed about creating his own era. &#xA0;He was the Immoral Prince.</span></p><p><span style="">The tracks of Prince Dean had finally appeared.</span></p><p><span style="">It meant Hyrkan was on the right path. &#xA0;It was evidence that he was carrying out the Immoral Prince episode correctly.</span></p><p><span style="">Of course, Hyrkan didn&apos;t care about the epic storyline related to Prince Dean.</span></p><p><span style="">The important thing right now was that he had discovered a Chimera Skeleton wearing an armor engraved with Prince Dean&apos;s crest. &#xA0;Basically, he had found the breadcrumbs left behind by Hansel and Gretel. </span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;I can finally get out of the Catacombs now.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">If he followed the breadcrumbs, he&apos;ll find the witch&apos;s house, then the delicious cookies making up the house will show itself.</span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan raised his head as he looked into the darkness.</span></p><p><span style="">Che-sulyun was checking out someone&apos;s youtube page through her smartphone. &#xA0;A slight wrinkle formed on her cold face. &#xA0;The wrinkle had formed near her bewitching eyes.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Why isn&#x2019;t he uploading any videos of it? &#xA0;I purposefully special ordered it from a designer.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">It was akin to gifting your significant other with a handmade scarf. This was like the boyfriend coming to the next date without the scarf around his neck. &#xA0;This was how she felt.</span></p><p><span style="">Of course, she had never felt this kinds of feelings before, so she couldn&apos;t identify what was fouling her mood like this. &#xA0;The fact that she couldn&apos;t identify this feeling meant it kept worsening her mood.</span></p><p><span style="">At that moment, the smart phone&apos;s screen suddenly changed. &#xA0;It was an incoming phone call. The call was coming from the Stormhunters guild. &#xA0;It was Hatch. &#xA0;It wouldn&apos;t be an exaggeration to say that he received the most abuse from Che-sulyun in the Stormhunters guild.</span></p><p><span style="">- Master. </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What is it?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">- Uh&#x2026;&#x2026;. </span></p><p><span style="">It was the effect of him being constantly berated by her. &#xA0;Hatch felt nervous when he heard Che-sulyun&apos;s voice. He knew he was sticking his hand into boiling oil.</span></p><p><span style="">Unfortunately, he had to continue on with his conversation.</span></p><p><span style="">- There is someone, who wants to speak directly to master.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Is he someone important?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">- At the very least, he is more famous than me. &#xA0;He also possesses very high level, and he holds a high position. &#xA0;His rank is a bit too ambiguous to describe it.</span></p><p><span style="">The light in Che-sulyun&apos;s eyes changed when she heard the expression he used. &#xA0;There was only one organization within Warlord where that particular turn of phrase was used to describe them.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Are you talking about a head of the Hydra guild?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">- Yes. </span></p><p><span style="">Hydra guild. </span></p><p><span style="">The nine heads possessed ranks that differentiated them, but at the same time, they were all heads. &#xA0;They were treated as equals. &#xA0;The organization didn&apos;t have the structure of boss, officers and underling. This was why their ranks were described as being a bit ambiguous.</span></p><p><span style="">Of course, this wasn&apos;t the immediate point she wanted to go over. </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Just say he is from the Hyrdra guild. &#xA0;Do you really have to speak in such a roundabout way?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">- The person insisted I describe it like that.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Is he next to you?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">- Yes. </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Did you secretly make some kind of deal with a head of the Hydra guild?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">- No way! I am contracted to be within the Stormhunters until 2050. &#xA0;I would never dare to do such an act. The other side approached me first. &#xA0;He wants to have a conversation about a Quest, and he asked to speak to someone of similar rank as him.</span></p><p><span style="">The heads of the Hydra guild was similar in rank as the Stormhunter&apos;s guild master. &#xA0;Che-sulyun was the only &#xA0;one, who fit the description.</span></p><p><span style="">This was the reason why Hatch had to call her.</span></p><p><span style="">The problem was the fact that Che-sulyun wasn&apos;t in a good mood.</span></p><p><span style="">Che-sulyun immediately answered him.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I bet he is trying sound out the relationship between our guilds. &#xA0;If he wants a conversation, then tell him to go through the official channel. &#xA0;The one, who wants something, should be the one crawling on the floor.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">- What? </span></p><p><span style="">Before Hatch could reply, the call ended.</span></p><p><span style="">The screen immediately changed to the Youtube page she had been viewing. &#xA0;However, there was a slight change on the screen.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Huh?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">He had uploaded a new video. &#xA0;The light within Che-sulyun&apos;s eyes changed as she played the new video.</span></p><p><span style="">In the video, a User wearing a Red Skeleton set appeared. A slight smile formed on Che-sulyun&apos;s lips when she saw the figure. &#xA0;When the video ended, she immediately called Hatch&apos;s phone.</span></p><p><span style="">- Ah, master! He says this business is really important. &#xA0;I&apos;m sure this is a negotiation regarding the Main Scenario Quest....</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I&apos;ll take the call now, so make room for him.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">- What? </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Didn&apos;t you say he is next to you? Give him the phone.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">After several seconds, she heard someone else&apos;s voice.</span></p><p><span style="">- I&apos;m the 5th head. &#xA0;We&apos;ve acquired a crucial clue regarding the Main Scenario Quest. &#xA0;We want to carry out the Quest with your guild.</span></p>
