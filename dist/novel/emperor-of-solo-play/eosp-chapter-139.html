<p><span style="">Chapter 139 - If You Set It on Fire, Blessings Will Come Your Way (3)</span></p><p>8.</p><p><span style="">Black Cobalt Zombie Warrior.</span></p><p><span style="">It was a monster made from the corpse of a level 160 monster called the Black Cobalt Warrior. &#xA0;It was level 170, and it was much stronger than the Black Cobalt Warrior. &#xA0;The Black Cobalt Warriors liked to move in a small group of ten. &#xA0;However, the Black Cobalt Zombie Warriors liked to form a group of 30 at the very least, or a group close to a 100 at the most.</span></p><p><span style="">This wasn&#x2019;t ideal for a small party hunt. &#xA0;One needed a large party or even a guild&apos;s hunt team. &#xA0;One needed that level of firepower to hunt these preys.</span></p><p><span style="">Yet a single person had challenged such a group.</span></p><p><span style="">However, this single User didn&apos;t face off against the Black Cobalt Warrior Zombies by himself.</span></p><p><span style="">Ddul-goo-ruhk, ddul-goo-ruhk! </span></p><p><span style="">The fearsome Zombie army would make anyone hesitate to attack it, but the group of Skeleton Warriors were beings that had forgotten about fear.</span></p><p><span style="">They had formed up in three ranks.</span></p><p><span style="">There were 3 lines, and each line held 10 Skeleton Warriors. &#xA0;Each line was differentiated by the equipments worn by the Skeleton Warriors.</span></p><p><span style="">The first and foremost line were lined up with Skeleton Warriors wearing pretty thick steel armors. &#xA0;It was hard to even identify them as Skeleton Warriors. &#xA0;They were wearing full plate armors. &#xA0;They wore hefty armors, yet the weapons they were holding looked much heavier. &#xA0;It was a weapon called a morning star, which had a heavy ball at the end. It also had thick spikes, which was especially impressive. </span></p><p><span style="">The second line wore red scaled armors, and it reminded one of Dragon Scales. &#xA0;There was a round wooden shield in their left hand, and they held a very wild-looking scimitar in their right hand.</span></p><p><span style="">The third line of Skeleton Warriors wore leather armors. &#xA0;It looked to be very well tanned. &#xA0;The green colored leather was very slick. &#xA0;It was quite mysterious in that the green colored leather kept blending into the surrounding vegetations. &#xA0;It made their presence dim. &#xA0;The Skeleton Warriors wearing the green colored leather armor didn&apos;t have any shields equipped. &#xA0;Instead, both hands held various types of sword. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">As the finishing stroke to the group, two Skeleton Knights surrounded in Bone Armor stood in the front, and they looked like the eyes of a fire dragon.</span></p><p><span style="">There were two instead of one.</span></p><p><span style="">Each of the two Skeleton Knights raised swords that was overflowing with a sense of presence. &#xA0;The two swords looked the same, but they differed in color. &#xA0;One was pitch black, and the other was shining with light. This was the only difference between the two Skeleton Knights. &#xA0;There was no difference that could be seen in what they intended to do.</span></p><p><span style="">The two Skeleton Knights opened their mouth, and they let out the world&apos;s most silent roar.</span></p><p><span style="">Ddul-goo-ruhk, ddul-goo-ruhk! </span></p><p><span style="">Accompanying the roar, the first, second and third line moved in order after the Skeleton Knights.</span></p><p><span style="">Ooh-uh-uh! Ooh-uh-uh!</span></p><p><span style="">However, the Zombies didn&apos;t retreat at the appearance of the Skeleton army. &#xA0;When one became a Zombie, one lost all fear and rational thought. &#xA0;They had no reasons to retreat. </span></p><p><span style="">Ddul-goo-ruhk, ddul-goo-ruhk! &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">The Skeletons also didn&apos;t know fear. &#xA0;The two groups were immune to fear, and they displayed their attack capabilities to their hearts content.</span></p><p><span style="">They didn&apos;t know what retreat was, and even if they knew what it was, it wouldn&apos;t be allowed. &#xA0;The two groups clashed against each other.</span></p><p><span style="">The line made contact with the other line. &#xA0;It was a clash between the two front lines. &#xA0;There was no defense here. &#xA0;The two lines rammed into each other as they attempted an all-out attack.</span></p><p><span style="">The weapons swung by the Black Cobalt Zombies, and the morning stars swung by the Skeleton Warriors was aimed at each other.</span></p><p><span style="">Their aim was the same, but the difference in result was stark.</span></p><p><span style="">Hoo-oohng! </span></p><p><span style="">The Black Cobalt Zombies swung their weapons in a wide arc, but their weapons only split empty air. &#xA0;The Skeleton Warriors wearing thick plated armor was lightly dodging their attacks.</span></p><p><span style="">Bbi-uhk! </span></p><p><span style="">After they dodged the attacks, the Skeleton Warriors in the front line swung their morning stars towards the head of the Cobalt Zombies.</span></p><p><span style="">All ten Skeleton Warriors had been able to dodge the attacks aimed at them, and they struck out. &#xA0;At the same time, they burrowed into the group of zombies. They were basically the shock troops. &#xA0;They ruthlessly destroyed the nearby heads of the zombies with their morning stars.</span></p><p><span style="">Then the second line of Skeleton Warriors followed in behind them. &#xA0;These Skeleton Warriors wore Dragon Scale armor, and they swung their scimitars. &#xA0;The headless body of the Cobalt Zombies were causing a problem, so they hacked at the body of the Cobalt Zombies. &#xA0;The Cobalt Zombies that were causing the disturbance was either swinging at empty air or they occasionally banged their sword against the shields. In front of the scimitar&#x2019;s crescent-shaped line, the headless Cobalt Zombies lost their limbs.</span></p><p><span style="">When the Cobalt Zombies were mutilated, it was the third line&apos;s job to put them down for good. &#xA0;They held weapons in both hands, and they were much faster than a Skeleton with only one weapon. &#xA0;Before the Cobalt Zombies could regenerate, they were diced up. &#xA0;The Cobalt Zombies had lost their heads and limbs, so they didn&apos;t have any methods to resist against the Skeleton Warriors equipped with two weapons.</span></p><p><span style="">It was a one sided battle! </span></p><p><span style="">In the battle, there was a mutated monster that was sending forth the Black Cobalt Zombies.</span></p><p><span style="">Ggoo-uh-uh! </span></p><p><span style="">It was twice as big as a normal Black Cobalt, and it appeared in front of the Cobalt Zombies. &#xA0;It was over 3 meters tall. &#xA0;It almost reached 4 meters in height, and the sword in the Cobalt Zombie&apos;s hand looked like a toy. &#xA0;It was letting out a roar through its rotten vocal cords, but there was a gravitas and a powerful presence within its voice. &#xA0;A horrifying dread was expressed through it.</span></p><p><span style="">It wasn&apos;t a being that the Skeleton Warriors could contend with.</span></p><p><span style="">Chul-kuhng, chul-huhng! </span></p><p><span style="">Of course, the Skeleton Knights stepped forward. &#xA0;They were 2 meters tall, and their body was very large thanks to the armors. &#xA0;Unlike the Skeleton Warriors, the Skeleton Knights appeared as they emitted a heavy sound.</span></p><p><span style="">Of course, size and sound wasn&apos;t the only difference between the Skeleton Knights and the Skeleton Warriors. &#xA0;The way they fought battle was also different. &#xA0;The Skeleton Knights didn&apos;t back down from opponents that were much bigger than them.</span></p><p><span style="">Hoo-oong! </span></p><p><span style="">They dodged attacks....</span></p><p><span style="">Ka-ahng! &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">They blocked attacks, but they never stepped backwards.</span></p><p><span style="">Shweeek! </span></p><p><span style="">The path of their sword swings were true. &#xA0;It wasn&apos;t just sharp enough to cause a superficial wound. &#xA0;It went beyond cutting flesh. &#xA0;The sword showed decisiveness that held the intent of obliterating the enemy&apos;s bones.</span></p><p><span style="">Kwah-jeek! </span></p><p><span style="">The number of swings were low, but the result of each swing was terrifying. &#xA0;The enormous mutated Cobalt Zombie&apos;s body was being cut away by the Skeleton Knight&apos;s sword. &#xA0;It was as if the Skeleton Knights were cutting a rotten daikon.</span></p><p><span style="">Ggoo-uh-uh! </span></p><p><span style="">In the end, the normal Cobalt Zombies lasted longer than the mutated Cobalt Zombie.</span></p><p><span style="">The anticipated card didn&apos;t perform as expected. &#xA0;In terms of a battle, this battle was already lost.</span></p><p><span style="">However, there was no retreat for the Black Cobalt Zombies. &#xA0;In fact, they charged towards their enemies. &#xA0;The Cobalt Zombies were being ruthlessly cut down in the front line, and the Cobalt Zombies in the rear was now charging towards the front.</span></p><p><span style="">Naturally, the Black Cobalt Zombies started to get clumped up and tangled with each other.</span></p><p><span style="">In the midst of this clusterfuck, an enormous flame that was burning ruthlessly coalesced to form a giant.</span></p><p><span style="">It was the Fire Golem! </span></p><p><span style="">The burning giant didn&apos;t have to think about how to attack this group. &#xA0;The Fire Golem belly flopped on top of the tangled Cobalt Zombie horde. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">Hwahl hwahl! </span></p><p><span style="">The Fire Golem&apos;s body started to burn the Cobalt Zombies.</span></p><p><span style="">Hwah-roo-roo! </span></p><p><span style="">Even as they were burning up, the Cobalt Zombies started using their swords against the Fire Golem. &#xA0;Maybe this was the result of them being unable to feel pain. &#xA0;Their bodies were burning, but the Fire Golem couldn&apos;t stop the sword strikes against it by the Cobalt Zombies. &#xA0;The power behind the strikes remained the same as before.</span></p><p><span style="">Shweek, shweeek! </span></p><p><span style="">Parts of the Fire Golem&apos;s body was being cut away by the sword strikes. &#xA0;The severed parts of the Fire Golem fell to the floor.</span></p><p><span style="">Kah-ahng! </span></p><p><span style="">The severed parts of the Fire Golem&apos;s body started to explode, and the fire became larger.</span></p><p><span style="">The Black Cobalt Zombies were trapped within the sea of flame, and the Skeleton Warriors continued with their slaughter.</span></p><p><span style="">After a brief moment, the scene of the battle started to dim. &#xA0;When the whole world turned black, white letters was placed over this dark world.</span></p><p><span style="">[To be continued] </span></p><p><span style="">The footage ended there.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Nice.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">The video was on full screen, so it filled the entire screen of the Tablet PC. &#xA0;He exited the full screen. &#xA0;Then he checked various things.... &#xA0;He looked at the information regarding the video, and he looked at the reaction given by the viewers.</span></p><p><span style="">- Two Skeleton Knights? &#xA0;How?</span></p><p><span style="">- I thought it was only possible to summon one Skeleton Knight?</span></p><p><span style="">- Is it a bug?</span></p><p><span style="">Ahn-jaehyuhn grinned as he read their assessment.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;It&apos;s a Skill instead of a bug. &#xA0;It&apos;s a Skill.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">Ahn-jaehyun released the new footage for free.</span></p><p><span style="">The video was titled Double Knights. It was the first video showing the activities of the two Skeleton Knights.</span></p><p><span style="">It was a mixture of the Hahoe Mask&apos;s fame, and the sensational description saying this was the first time this was being shown. &#xA0;It resulted in the views skyrocketing.</span></p><p><span style="">In one day, he achieved 8 million views! </span></p><p><span style="">However, the thing that made Ahn-jaehyun happier than the view counts was the reason behind the video. &#xA0;It was the [Chivalry] Skill that had allowed him to make this video.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;As expected, this game gets fun at the latter stages.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">When he summoned the Skeleton Knight, two special abilities were activated.</span></p><p><span style="">The Skeleton Knight&apos;s Stats increased proportionally to the number of Skeleton Warriors being summoned. &#xA0;When the Skeleton Knights were summoned, the Leader ability increased the Stats of the Skeleton Warriors. &#xA0;These were the two abilities.</span></p><p><span style="">However, these two abilities had a fixed value. Even as the Skeleton Knight&apos;s Skill Proficiency increased, these two skill Options didn&apos;t change. &#xA0;If one wanted to change the fixed nature of these two abilities, one had two obtain two other Skills.</span></p><p><span style="">The [Chivalry] Skill gained by Anh-jaehyun was basically like an upgrade software.</span></p><p><span style="">The newly acquired [Chivalry] Skill had the following effects.</span></p><p><span style="">[Chivalry] </span></p><p><span style="">- Proficiency : Rank F</span></p><p><span style="">- You can summon one more Skeleton Knight.</span></p><p><span style="">- With the summon of the Skeleton Knight, you will be able to summon additional (3) Skeleton underlings.</span></p><p><span style="">- Each additional summoned Skeleton Warrior will increase the Skeleton Knight&apos;s Stats by (6) percent. &#xA0;At most, it can be increased by 30%. </span></p><p><span style="">It increased the number of Skeleton Knights he could summon. &#xA0;The Chivalry Skill increased the special abilities, and on top of it all, it allowed one to summon additional Skeleton underlings.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;I also have to gain the [Leader] Skill, but at this current time, [Chivalry] is better than the [Leader]&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">The [Leader] Skill was similar to the [Chivalry] Skill. &#xA0;It also increased the number of Skeleton Knights one could summon, and it also increased the number of Skeleton underlings too.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;If I combine it with the [Chivalry] Skill...&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">If he could purchase the Death Knight Skill in the future, then he&apos;ll also have to gain the [Chivalric Order] Skill, which also had the effect of increasing the number of Skeleton Knights.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Rich Lich was able to summon four Skeleton Knights.&#x2019; &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">Rich Lich used this process to be able to summon four Skeleton Knights. &#xA0;He bought numerous No Name Skill boost to gain the [Chivalry] and [Leader] Skills. &#xA0;Then he obtained the Death Knight Skills. &#xA0;He had been able to summon a total of four Death Knights.</span></p><p><span style="">However, it didn&apos;t end there.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;If I can use the Ancient Power to reinforce my Skills.... &#xA0;How many Skeleton Knights will I be able to summon?</span></p><p><span style="">With the appearance of the Ruined kingdom, the new contents would be released. &#xA0;One will be able to use the Ancient Power to reinforce an A Rank Skill.</span></p><p><span style="">Rich Lich hadn&apos;t reached this point. &#xA0;He would truly be in uncharted territory.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hoo-ooh.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">At that part, Ahn-jaehyun let out a deep sigh.</span></p><p><span style="">The Hahoe Mask could still get stronger. &#xA0;This was something that made him feel happy and excited. &#xA0;It was something he was looking forward to.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Urugal mountain range&#x2026;&#x2026; I have to get over it, yet I have idea how I&apos;ll do it.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">However, if he wanted that content, he had to cross the Urugal mountain range, and he had to discover the Ruined Kingdom.</span></p><p><span style="">The Ruined Kingdom had to appear for the third Main Scenario Quest to start. &#xA0;Then the second Advancement contents will be released, and the Skill Reinforcement would included. &#xA0;He had to reach level 300, not level 200 by that time. &#xA0;If not, he won&apos;t be able to go through his 2nd Advancement, and it would be impossible for him to do the Skill Reinforcement. &#xA0;Of course, he wouldn&apos;t be able to gain the Death Knight Skill either.</span></p><p><span style="">However, Anh-jaehyun wasn&apos;t confident that he would be able to cross the Urugal mountain range right now.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;In the end, I&apos;m not sure I&apos;ll be able to do it even if I reach level 200.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">Even if he reached level 200, he wasn&apos;t confident he&apos;ll be able to cross the Urugal mountain range even with the Arbiter of Corruption Ring and the Deposed Prince&apos;s Sword equipped.</span></p><p><span style="">Still, this didn&apos;t mean he was kosher with working with others. &#xA0;Ahn-jaehyun had already suckerpunched the Red Bulls guild, who had been amicable towards him. &#xA0;Hydra guild also didn&apos;t look too fondly on the Hahoe Mask. If he had to pick one, who might show goodwill towards him, it was the Stormhunters. &#xA0;However, they weren&apos;t even a viable choice for him.</span></p><p><span style="">This was the reason why he could only sigh.</span></p><p><span style="">At that moment...</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Wait a sec.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">Ahn-jaehyun&apos;s expression changed once again. &#xA0;While he was sighing, he suddenly remembered something that changed his expression. </span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;The Frozen Kingdom!&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">It was the event stage located across the Terube castle walls. &#xA0;It was called the Frozen Kingdom. &#xA0;It was an event stage made for level 200 Users.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Why the hell did I forget about the Frozen Kingdom?&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">To be precise, there were several event stages like the Frozen Kingdom that&apos;ll give clues as to the existence of the Ruined Kingdom. &#xA0;One would be able to find out that the Ruined Kingdom was across the Urugual mountain range through these events.</span></p><p><span style="">From Ahn-jaehyun&apos;s perspective, he already had this information, so he had tried to skip couple steps in the process. &#xA0;This was why he had forgotten about the Frozen Kingdom.</span></p><p><span style="">He remembered what kind of place it was, and before he returned to the past, he remembered this stage had been set up for a certain person.... &#xA0;He had forgotten about it for a brief time.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;I forgot something that is very important. &#xA0;Of course, I can&apos;t leave out the Frozen Kingdom. &#xA0;I have to gain all the benefits from it. &#xA0;I must!&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">Then he thought about it again.</span></p><p><span style="">Ahn-jaehyun immediately turned his gaze towards his Tablet PC. &#xA0;As a precaution, he planned on searching the web for the Frozen Kingdom. &#xA0;When Ahn-jaehyun swiped at his Tablet PC, the page returned to the previous page. &#xA0;The ranking of the videos appeared.</span></p><p><span style="">At that moment, Ahn-jaehyun&apos;s expression turned sour. &#xA0;It was the Weekly Warlord Video Ranking, and his video was 2nd in terms of views. &#xA0;This was the cause of his dour mood.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;V&amp;V guild&#x2026;&#x2026; They ain&apos;t playing around.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">The V&amp;V guild&apos;s Blood Ogre Raid video had been uploaded around the same time as Ahn-jaehyun&apos;s video, and it had about twice as many views. &#xA0;Moreover, the footage was worth the interest and praise it was getting.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;It basically means the newly added Users aren&apos;t normal Users.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">Even in Ahn-jaehyun&apos;s view, the Team Poker&apos;s strength was impressive. &#xA0;This was especially true for the newly added members. &#xA0;Their skills approached the skills of the Matador and the Storm Queen. &#xA0;Basically, they were almost on a similar level as the Warlord&apos;s best Strikers. </span></p><p><span style="">Of course, this simple fact wouldn&apos;t have struck Anh-jaehyun&apos;s nerve. &#xA0;The part that struck his nerve was the fact that the face of a User he already knew wasn&apos;t part of the new faces.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Why isn&apos;t the one that tried to kill me amongst them? &#xA0;Wasn&apos;t he a guild member of the V&amp;V guild? &#xA0;Didn&apos;t he have the V&amp;V guild mark on at that time?&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">This fact kept bothering Ahn-jaehyun.</span></p><p>9.</p><p><span style="">The change that happened in the V&amp;V guild was extreme, and the result of this change was also extraordinary. &#xA0;Until now, the V&amp;V guild had been considered to be the middle of the pack within the 30 great guilds. &#xA0;However, the value of V&amp;V guild&apos;s name shot up in an instant from the release of a single Blood Ogre Raid video. &#xA0;They were starting to be judged in the same breath as the Big 3.</span></p><p><span style="">This fact had a big impact on the other 30 great guilds. &#xA0;They were already beyond the point where the 30 great guilds could choose to go through a change. &#xA0;They were starting to be forced to change.</span></p><p><span style="">However, not many guilds tried to go for an aggressive transformation. &#xA0;If one tried to force a changed like the V&amp;V guild, the guild would suffer bone grinding pain.</span></p><p><span style="">However, even if one looked into an organization going through such a pain, there was inevitably a different degree of pain being felt by the Users. &#xA0;Moreover, no one wanted &#xA0;to be the one to suffer the worst of the pain.</span></p><p><span style="">Big Smiles guild repeatedly held officer&#x2019;s meetings, but in the process, they weren&#x2019;t able to come up with a clear plan of action. &#xA0;This was the big reason why they couldn&#x2019;t come to a consensus.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Shit!&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;They are really looking at me as if I&#x2019;m some pushover!&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">The one, who felt the most pressure, in such a situation, was Apollo. &#xA0;He was a newly minted officer. &#xA0;If one took away his background, he was useless. </span></p><p><span style="">It had been implied that Apollo would be forced to make sacrifices.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;How dare they treat me like this? &#xA0;Someday I&apos;ll take over the Big Smiles guild....&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">From Apollo&#x2019;s perspective, he couldn&#x2019;t help, but feel depressed at the recent developments. &#xA0;At the very least, he hadn&#x2019;t paid exorbitant amount of money to be treated like this as an officer of the Big Smiles.</span></p><p><span style="">At that moment, someone called Apollo. &#xA0;When he checked who was calling, Apollo immediately answered the phone.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hyung-nim.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Apollo was someone, who only thought highly of himself, yet he called someone &apos;hyung-nim&apos;? &#xA0;A very rare greeting came out of Apollo&apos;s mouth.</span></p><p><span style="">- Apollo.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes. &#xA0;Please speak.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">The identity of the man being called hyung-nim by Apollo was none other than Brooks. &#xA0;He was an officer of the Big Smiles. &#xA0;He had been the biggest help in allowing Apollo reach the status of officer in the Big Smiles guild. &#xA0;Even after he was put in the officer role, Brooks continued to help out Apollo.</span></p><p><span style="">- You must be in a foul mood from the officer meeting, right?</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;No way.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Moreover, he was the only other officer that understood Apollo&#x2019;s mood.</span></p><p><span style="">These were enough reasons for Apollo to call Brooks as his hyung-nim.</span></p><p><span style="">- As you can probably see, the inner structure of this guild is rotten. &#xA0;None of them wants to load their guns.</span></p><p><span style="">Of course, Brooks didn&apos;t help out Apollo out of genuine kindness.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">- This is why I&apos;m trying to use this opportunity to become the guild master.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Brooks finally revealed his ambition.</span></p><p><span style="">- There is one characteristic that is common amongst the Big 3. &#xA0;All three guild masters hold an incredible amount of power. &#xA0;&#xA0;Look at the state of our guild. &#xA0;We have over ten officers, and it has been a revolving door on who becomes the guild master amongst them. &#xA0;This is why the position of guild master has become marginalized in our guild. &#xA0;This is our guild&#x2019;s problem.</span></p><p><span style="">This was also the reason why Brooks had brought Apollo to the Big Smiles guild as an officer. &#xA0;When one wanted to become a guild master with a strong grip over the guild, one needed a support base.</span></p><p><span style="">Moreover, Apollo was well aware of this fact. &#xA0;Apollo wasn&#x2019;t stupid. &#xA0;He already understood that Brooks wasn&#x2019;t helping out through pure generosity.</span></p><p><span style="">Apollo actually felt better when he was given a deal. &#xA0;He smiled.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;So what do you want me to do, hyung-nim?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">- We are going to induce a guild war. &#xA0;We&apos;ll pick a fight with the Hydra guild.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">However, the smile he had from his good mood disappeared in an instant.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;The Hydra guild?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">- I&apos;ll tell you the detailed plan after I hear your decision. &#xA0;However, I can guarantee you one thing. &#xA0;If you help me become the guild master, I&apos;ll make you a guild master to one of the sub-guilds. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">A guild war with the Hydra guild? &#xA0;Apollo felt a chill run up his spine when he heard those words.</span></p><p><span style="">On the other hand, he was being guaranteed a position as the sub-guild master. &#xA0;It was an attractive offer. &#xA0;It blinded Apollo.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Brooks hyung-nim isn&apos;t an idiot. &#xA0;He wouldn&#x2019;t recklessly start a guild war without any preparations.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I&apos;ll follow hyung-nim.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">- All right. &#xA0;Before we get to that, I want to introduce you to someone. &#xA0;You probably know him, since you guys met before once.</span></p>
