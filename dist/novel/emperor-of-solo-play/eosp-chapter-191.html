&#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">A User wearing a Hahoe Mask was looking at the Dragon from the ground. &#xA0;He let out a deep sigh.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;This game is really fucked up.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">After letting out a sigh, Hyrkan raised his head again to look at the Dragon. &#xA0;It was one kilometer long. &#xA0;It was capable enough to bring calamity to the world. &#xA0;It was the final boss with an awesome presence.</span></p><p><span style="">Its official name was Dragon.</span></p><p><span style="">However, the Users added the &#x2018;of Calamity&#x2019; to the short name. &#xA0;The title stuck.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;I&#x2019;ll have to climb from the tail to reach its body. &#xA0;Then I have to stab the War King&#x2019;s Spear into the wound on its neck.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">In short order, Hyrkan would have to start his monster hunt against the ridiculous Dragon of Calamity.</span></p><p><span style="">The hunting method was simple.</span></p><p><span style="">When the one kilometer long Dragon approaches the ground, the Dragon&#x2019;s tail will touch the ground. &#xA0;As the tail scrapes across the ground, one would have to stick to the tail. &#xA0;This was the starting point. &#xA0;As the Dragon ascends into the sky, he would have to travel from the tail to the neck. &#xA0;He had to crawl up a distance of 1 kilometer, then he would have to find the wound on the neck. &#xA0;Then he just had to plant the crude looking spear into the wound.</span></p><p><span style="">He had to be cautious of only one thing.</span></p><p><span style="">Falling! </span></p><p><span style="">The Dragon&#x2019;s body moved so roughly that a rodeo couldn&#x2019;t hold a candle to this. &#xA0;The only thing one had to worry about was falling off the Dragon.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I really want to see what the bastard, who made this shitty game, looks like.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">This was obvious, but everything about this was insane. &#xA0;Moreover, Hyrkan had to solo this craziness.</span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan already felt queasy. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">He didn&#x2019;t have a fear of heights, but he would probably develop one that day.</span></p><p><span style="">- Get ready, Hahoe Mask.</span></p><p><span style="">At that moment, a clear and very beautiful voice rang out inside the Hahoe Mask&#x2019;s ears.</span></p><p><span style="">- The tail will reach the ground soon.</span></p><p><span style="">Shir had a voice that was very easy on the ears. &#xA0;However, instead of smiling, Hyrkan frowned a little bit.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I know.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">He answered in a brusque voice.</span></p><p><span style="">- Bear this in mind. &#xA0;When you climb the Dragon&#x2019;s tail&#x2026;.. </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I&#x2019;m more knowledgeable than about the process, so you don&#x2019;t have to explain it to me.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">- Also, when this game ends&#x2026;.. </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Let&#x2019;s talk about it when we get to that point. &#xA0;Stop treating me like your underling. &#xA0;I&apos;m unaffiliated right now. &#xA0;Stop telling me what to do.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">- I&#x2019;m sorry.</span></p><p><span style="">At that moment, Shir apologized when she heard his brusque response. &#xA0;Hyrkan suddenly became speechless.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;...this is driving me nuts.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">Shir responded in such a docile manner that Hyrkan had a hard time accepting the situation.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;You are going to do it even if I try to stop you. &#xA0;Don&#x2019;t worry about it. &#xA0;There&#x2019;s nothing I can&#x2018;t do now.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">In the end, Hyrkan caressed the situation instead of baring his teeth.</span></p><p><span style="">- Fighting. </span></p><p><span style="">Shir gave a cheer for Hyrkan. &#xA0;He let out a deep sigh at her words.</span></p><p><span style="">This was how the call came to an end. </span></p><p><span style="">The Dragon, which had been circling the sky, was incrementally getting closer to the ground.</span></p><p><span style="">At the same time, the Dragon&#x2019;s tail descended towards the ground. &#xA0;&#xA0;The lowered tail would reach Hyrkan in couple of minutes.</span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan clenched his two fists as he looked at the Dragon.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;This is it.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">This was the final battle. &#xA0;It didn&#x2019;t matter if he won or lost. &#xA0;He would leave Warlord after this. &#xA0;He already gave his announcement to the public. &#xA0;If he won, he&#x2019;ll retire. &#xA0;Even if he lost, he&#x2019;ll give up on Warlord, and he would retire.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;I&#x2019;ll probably be too embarrassed to come back.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">He couldn&#x2019;t go back on his words. &#xA0;Hyrkan had already given his announcement. &#xA0;He would feel too much shame if he went back on his words.</span></p><p><span style="">Of course, he had no regrets.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Yes. &#xA0;I have put an end to this long relationship. &#xA0;It isn&#x2019;t as if I can always devote my life to Warlord.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan actually felt relieved.</span></p><p><span style="">From the time before he came back to the past and afterwards, his life had been intertwined with Warlord. &#xA0;Thanks to Warlord, he had lived through difficult times. &#xA0;On the other hand, Warlord now allowed him to prosper in life.</span></p><p><span style="">He had shared the good times and the bad times with Warlord. &#xA0;He had experienced all sorts of emotions. &#xA0;Now it was time to let it go. &#xA0;There was no game in this world that could be played forever. &#xA0;Everything in this world had a start and an end. &#xA0;An end was needed to start a new beginning.</span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan stood up from his seat. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">The Skeletons&#x2019; gaze moved in sync with Hyrkan&#x2019;s movement.</span></p><p><span style="">Until a moment ago, his Skeleton Warriors, Knights and Death Knight had fought against the warriors controlled by the Dragon. &#xA0;The signs of battle was all over their bodies.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Ah.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan hesitated for a brief moment as he looked at the wounds they received from the fight.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ah.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">He stopped for a brief moment to look at them. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan unconsciously raised his hand towards the nearest Skeleton Warrior.</span></p><p><span style="">Ssoo-oohk! </span></p><p><span style="">The Skeleton Warrior quickly dodged the hand.</span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan let out a bitter laugh when he saw the Skeleton Warrior&#x2019;s action. &#xA0;Hyrkan once again extended his hand in a swift manner. &#xA0;The Skeleton Warrior tried hard to dodge the hand, but at a certain point, Hyrkan had grabbed the head of the Skeleton Warrior.</span></p><p><span style="">After grabbing the head of the Skeleton Warrior, Hyrkan brought his head towards it.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Thank you for everything.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Toohk&#xB7;&#xB7;&#xB7;&#xB7;&#xB7;&#xB7; Toohk&#xB7;&#xB7;&#xB7;&#xB7;&#xB7;&#xB7;. </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;In many ways, you guys met a strange owner. &#xA0;Still, I was able to reach this point, because of you all.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan lightly and gently knocked heads with the Skeleton Warrior&#x2019;s skull.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;This is goodbye.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">After he spoke his words, Hyrkan took off his Hahoe Mask. &#xA0;He had revealed his face to the world.</span></p><p><span style="">Soon, the world will know his face through the Stormhunter&#x2019;s live channel.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Goodbye Skeletons and the Hahoe Mask.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">The world would remember the Hahoe Mask Hyrkan. &#xA0;However, now they would remember Ahn-jaehyun, who was the Hahoe Mask Hyrkan.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Let&#x2019;s end this.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan put an end to the very long relationship he had with the Hahoe Mask.</span></p><p>3.</p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I want 10 dollar worth of lottery ticket with random draw.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">The part time worker had been watching a video on his tablet. &#xA0;He paused the video before he calculated the customer&#x2019;s order.</span></p><p><span style="">As the customer ordered, he printed out a lottery ticket as he let the machine pick random numbers. &#xA0;Then he scanned the barcode of the customer&#x2019;s other item.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Since this is a beef gimbap&#x2026;. &#xA0;The total is 15 dollars.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Here.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes. &#xA0;Thank y&#xB7;&#xB7;&#xB7;&#xB7;&#xB7;&#xB7;.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">He saw a 50 dollar bill in front of his eyes, so the part time worker naturally raised his eyes to look at the customer. &#xA0;The customer was rail thin, and he was wearing thick glasses. Overall, he looked like a pushover. &#xA0;The customer looked like someone that will fall for any deceit.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Huh?&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">At that moment, the convenience store&#x2019;s part timer felt as if he had seen this person before.</span></p><p><span style="">This was why he asked a question.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Have I met you before from somewhere?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Instead of answering, the customer&#x2019;s brows furrowed a little bit.</span></p><p><span style="">The part timer thought he had overstepped his bounds, so he quickly gave the customer his change and the lottery ticket.</span></p><p><span style="">The customer exited the convenience store, and the part timer started up the video on his tablet again.</span></p><p><span style="">- Uh? &#xA0;Hahoe Mask! &#xA0;The Hahoe Mask took off his Hahoe Mask!</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ah!&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">At that moment, the part time worker stood up from his seat in shock. &#xA0;Then he looked out the window. &#xA0;He saw the customer get into a very sleek and new lamborghini. &#xA0;&#xA0;The part time worker yelled as he looked at the customer.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;My god. &#xA0;He&#x2019;s the Hahoe Mask Hyrkan, Ahn-jaehyun! &#xA0;This is crazy! &#xA0;I have to get his signature. &#xA0;A signature....&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">The part timer tried to rush out, but the customer&#x2019;s car was already pulling out towards the road.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ah-oh!&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">In the end, the part time worker had to give up on getting the signature.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;This is nuts. &#xA0;How could I not recognize the Hahoe Mask?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">He was an avid fan of the Hahoe Mask. &#xA0;He kicked himself for not recognizing the Hahoe Mask.</span></p><p><span style="">After his despair came to an end, he had a question.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Why did the Hahoe Mask buy a lottery ticket? &#xA0;He retired from Warlord, but didn&#x2019;t he make a lot of money? &#xA0;I thought he sold several million copies of his Frozen Kingdom episode.&#x2019;</span></p><p>4.</p><p><span style="">He had his hands on the sleek handle of the lamborghini. &#xA0;He wore a Patek Philippe watch on his wrist, and he was oozing with presence.</span></p><p><span style="">What he wore and drove was much more expensive than a house. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">Ahn-jaehyun opened the beef kimbap he purchased earlier, and he started chewing on a piece.</span></p><p><span style="">As he ate, he thought about the lottery numbers he had purchased.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;I should have memorized the winning lottery number.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Fuck the IRS!&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">At that moment, Ahn-jaehyun unconsciously let out a wail of despair.</span></p><p><span style="">Ahn-jaehyun replayed the conversation he had with the agents of the IRS.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Mr. Ahn-jaehyun. &#xA0;You have evaded paying a significant amount of tax.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;It wasn&#x2019;t tax evasion&#x2026;..&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">When he retired from Warlord, Ahn-jaehyun did everything he couldn&#x2019;t do before, because he had been playing Warlord. &#xA0;First, he bought and moved into the best penthouse apartment he could find. &#xA0;Then he bought a lamborghini in one lump sum. &#xA0;Afterwards, he slowly bought luxury items to fill up his newly purchased apartment.</span></p><p><span style="">Those were his happy days. &#xA0;He was so happy that he sometimes forgot to eat!</span></p><p><span style="">However, a dark cloud appeared above Ahn-jaehyun&#x2019;s happiness.</span></p><p><span style="">Ahn-jaehyun had made an enormous amount of money through Warlord. &#xA0;Moreover, he participated in some shady practices to pay less tax, and he had been caught by the IRS. &#xA0;Of course, Ahn-jaehyun hadn&#x2019;t known he had participated in a shady practice. &#xA0;The accountant he hired said everyone did it, and he would be an idiot if he didn&#x2019;t take advantage of it.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;We don&#x2019;t care about your situation, Mr. Ahn-jaehyun. &#xA0;Our role is to take back the exact amount you owe us in taxes.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Anyways, this problem exploded in his face. &#xA0;He had never dealt with IRS agents before, so he was at a loss as to what to do.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;You have two choices. &#xA0;We can do this by force. &#xA0;Or you can cooperate with us, and we can come to an agreement.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I...I&#x2019;ll cooperate.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">He decided to pay his taxes.</span></p><p><span style="">However, there was a problem. &#xA0;Ahn-jaehyun didn&#x2019;t have enough liquid assets to pay off the taxes in its entirety. &#xA0;The tax bill wasn&#x2019;t small. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">In the end, the IRS took his cut of the profit in selling footages of Warlord. &#xA0;Moreover, they took his sponsorship money.</span></p><p><span style="">This was the reason behind his purchase of the lottery ticket.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Shit.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">He purchased a lottery ticket every time Ahn-jaehyun ate beef kimbap and ramen. &#xA0;He prayed for a winning lottery ticket.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Should I go to Che-sulyun, and ask her to buy me some meat? &#xA0;Shit. &#xA0;I acted so bold in front of Che-sulyun, so how would I look if I asked her to buy me some meat? &#xA0;Ah, this is driving me nuts. &#xA0;I should have just kept my money. &#xA0;Why did I have to buy&#x2026;..&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">He wallowed in his pain and suffering as he chew on the beef kimbap.</span></p><p><span style="">At that moment, a call arrived.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Receive incoming call!&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">When Ahn-jaehyun yelled out, a hologram picture of a phone appeared in front of his eyes. &#xA0;The caller&#x2019;s name also appeared.</span></p><p><span style="">The caller was Che-sulyun.</span></p><p><span style="">- Ahn-jaehyun. &#xA0;Tobot Soft officially announced their next project.</span></p><p><span style="">- There will be two version to the next project. &#xA0;One will be the light version where normal Users will be able to enjoy themselves. &#xA0;The other version is the Pro version. &#xA0;It is said that no one can beat it.</span></p><p><span style="">As soon as her words ended, he heard the voice of Tobi Gwynn. &#xA0;His voice filled the interior of Ahn-jaehyun&#x2019;s car.</span></p><p><span style="">- Was the Pro Version an attempt to dominate the rapidly growing VR eSports market?</span></p><p><span style="">- It was the same during the days of Warlord. &#xA0;Tobot Soft always strives to make that one special game. &#xA0;We make unique products. &#xA0;Our next project is a challenge we are putting out to the VR pro-gamers. &#xA0;I&apos;ll guarantee it. &#xA0;This game will be more difficult than any other game in the market.</span></p><p><span style="">- How difficult is it? </span></p><p><span style="">- Do you remember the Hahoe Mask&#x2019;s Skeletons? &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">- Of course, They are still legendary. </span></p><p><span style="">- We took the battle AI possessed by the Hahoe Mask&#x2019;s Skeletons, and we strengthened it using the Deep Learning system. &#xA0;All the battle AI of monsters will be based on it. &#xA0;I&#x2019;ll guarantee it. &#xA0;This game will be burdensome even for the Hahoe Mask.</span></p><p><span style="">Tobi Gwynn&#x2019;s voice came to an end there.</span></p><p><span style="">- Ahn-jaehyun. </span></p><p><span style="">Che-sulyun&#x2019;s voice could be heard again.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">- The Stormhunter&#x2019;s next target is the sequel to Warlord. &#xA0;We&#x2019;ve picked out our members. &#xA0;Of course, this will be the stage where you&#x2019;ll debut as a member of the Stormhunters.</span></p><p><span style="">At her words, Ahn-jaehyun had a smile on his face.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Is that all you have to say to me?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">- That&#x2019;s all I have to say for now. &#xA0;However, I am curious about something.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Speak.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">- You&#x2019;ll be meeting the Skeletons you grew and trained as an enemy. &#xA0;How do you feel about it? &#xA0;You&#x2019;ve never fought against your Skeletons before.</span></p><p><span style="">At her question, the smile on his face was wiped away.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Wait a moment.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">After receiving the question, Ahn-jaehyun seriously mulled over it. &#xA0;As he thought more on it, Ahn-jaehyun&#x2019;s expression crumpled.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;It&#x2019;ll be a damn annoying game. &#xA0;A really damn annoying game&#x2026;. &#xA0;Shit. &#xA0;Can&#x2019;t I just play a different game?</span></p><p><span style="">- You are the one, who signed the contract. &#xA0;Of course, you can pay the penalty to get out of the contract. &#xA0;Do you have that kind of money?</span></p><p><span style="">At her words, Ahn-jaehyun let out a sigh as he spoke.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Anyways, does our guild do any company dinners? &#xA0;Shouldn&#x2019;t we do a regular get-together in a barbeque restaurant?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">However, there was no answer to his questions. &#xA0;She had already ended the call.</span></p><p><span style="">Ahn-jaehyun, who had his hands on the handle, glanced at his Patek Philippe watch.</span></p>
