The fact that one quickly crossed the Urugal mountain range didn&apos;t mean a rosy future was in front of the User.</span></p><p><span style="">Even after accounting for all these factors, numerous Users were climbing the Urugal mountain range.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;They are trying to cross over, because they don&apos;t know that hell is awaiting them.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">The Ruined Kingdom across the Urugal mountain range was desolate and terrifying. &#xA0;If they knew what was awaiting them, they wouldn&apos;t be so eager.</span></p><p><span style="">Of course, there was no reason for Hyrkan to reflect on their future difficulties. &#xA0;Hyrkan had to only worry about his own business.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;The hunting ground around here is subpar. &#xA0;Maybe I should take a break, and come back in peak condition. &#xA0;Still, it feels weird sleeping for four hours right now.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">It happened as he was trying to digest his current problem.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Are you the real Hahoe Mask?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">While he was agonizing over his decision, a voice intruded on his thoughts from behind him. &#xA0;Hyrkan turned his head to look.</span></p><p><span style="">It was a very unremarkable looking woman. &#xA0;She wouldn&apos;t leave a deep impression even if he saw her in the streets. &#xA0;Moreover, her armor wasn&apos;t something that was equipped with defense solely in mind. &#xA0;The armor looked like a slightly casual designer clothes. It was something the female Users wore, because it looked pretty. &#xA0;It was seen quite often in regions where low level Users played.</span></p><p><span style="">However, the fact that she was wearing these kinds of clothes here told him a whole different story.</span></p><p><span style="">This was midway up the Urugal mountain. &#xA0;Amongst the currently discovered normal hunting grounds, this was one of the top 5 in difficulty.</span></p><p><span style="">This wasn&apos;t a stage where one could dress up and be pretentious. &#xA0;It meant she had the skills, guts, Items and level to dress in such a manner.</span></p><p><span style="">This was why Hyrkan didn&apos;t ignore her. &#xA0;Instead of ignoring her, he gave a reply as he tapped at his Hahoe Mask with his finger.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I don&apos;t know. &#xA0;Aren&apos;t there a lot of fakes going around right now? &#xA0;Isn&apos;t that true?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">The female User immediately replied to Hyrkan&apos;s gesture.</span></p><p><span style="">Instead of a verbal answer, Hyrkan once again brought up his left wrist.... &#xA0;He tapped his wrist, which was covered with armor and glove.</span></p><p><span style="">Every skilled Users that had reached this point knew what that gesture meant.</span></p><p><span style="">The reaction didn&apos;t come from the female User in front of Hyrkan. &#xA0;The Users in the surrounding reacted.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I think that&apos;s the Watchman Style!&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Watchman? &#xA0;Ah! &#xA0;Is that where both Users sever their wrists to exchange their wristwatches and fight?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Huh? &#xA0;I thought Watchman Style was a method where one has to sever one&apos;s wrist and give one&apos;s watch to the Hahoe Mask. &#xA0;Isn&apos;t this a method used to ask for forgiveness from him?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;You are all wrong. &#xA0;The Watchman Style indicates the price of the wristwatch. &#xA0;It always means ten thousand gold. He tapped it once, so if one wants to live, ten thousand gold has to be given to him.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Of course, everyone gathered here had a different definition, but that wasn&apos;t a problem. &#xA0;The only fact that mattered was the fact that Users rarely got away with starting a quarrel with Hyrkan, and everyone was aware of this. &#xA0;That was all that was needed.</span></p><p><span style="">Of course, everyone was tense, but at the same time, they were entertained with what was going on.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Aren&apos;t they from the Mig guild?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;The Mig guild&#xB7;&#xB7;&#xB7;&#xB7;&#xB7;&#xB7;.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;They are below the Underfoot guilds, but they have a good amount of experts. &#xA0;Moreover, this guild is pretty lax in their members transferring out, so a lot of Users use this guild as a stepping stone to move up. &#xA0;Many Users from this guild eventually moved on to become members of the 30 great guilds or the Underfoot guilds.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What&#x2019;s the Hahoe Mask&apos;s chance of winning?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hahoe Mask will win. &#xA0;However, it won&apos;t be easy or boring.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;If they don&apos;t die in a boring manner, the footage would haul in a lot. &#xA0;It is &#xA0;profitable to be killed by the Hahoe Mask now.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Currently, the Users gathered in front of the Voodoook&apos;s tunnel wanted to cross the Urugal mountain range, and they all had the capability of earning a decent amount of money.</span></p><p><span style="">These Users could monetize a User&apos;s death or loss by the Hahoe Mask.</span></p><p><span style="">The Users that were hidden in the surrounding was adept at maneuvering through these various factors.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;No. &#xA0;Wait a moment...&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">As if she could feel the mood around her, the female User quickly waved her hand as she spoke. </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I don&apos;t have any plans to fight with you. &#xA0;I just want to make a deal with you.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan lightly nodded his head as an answer. &#xA0;It basically meant she should speak the terms of her deal.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I&apos;ll introduce myself first. &#xA0;I&apos;ve been a part of a lot of organizations, but I&apos;m currently with the Mig guild. &#xA0;My name is Queeng.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Queeng. </span></p><p><span style="">It was unique name, but there was no reason why one couldn&apos;t use such a name in the game.</span></p><p><span style="">The important part was the fact that he didn&apos;t remember that name. &#xA0;This User has a unique name, yet he didn&apos;t remember it. &#xA0;It meant this User was probably mediocre. &#xA0;At the very least, she was mediocre using Hyrkan&apos;s standards.</span></p><p><span style="">She spoke about what she wanted to achieve.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;We are 3rd in line. &#xA0;Currently, there is an empty spot in my party. &#xA0;Would you perhap like to do this with us?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">The Users had been watching with bated breath, but they all let out an exclamation when they heard her words.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Ah! &#xA0;Holy crap!&#x2019; &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Shit! &#xA0;I should have offered it first!&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;We could have been carried!&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">Naturally, the interest of the Users in the surrounding shifted towards what the Hahoe Mask would say next.</span></p><p><span style="">Will he turn down or accept the offer?</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;The rights to the battle footage will all be mine.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Agreed.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Also, you guys have to listen to my directions no matter what.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;If it is rational, we will.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Lastly, if you plan on fucking me over, I can guarantee you&apos;ll have to pray to god that you won&apos;t come across me on the other side of the Urugal mountain range.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I&apos;ll keep that in mind.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan accepted the offer.</span></p><p>5.</p><p><span style="">The average level of the group was 203.</span></p><p><span style="">The 6 Users were all affiliated with the Mig guild, and they had all finished their 2nd Advancement.</span></p><p><span style="">However, their party composition was very unbalanced. &#xA0;Queeng was the only Tanker. &#xA0;There were three Magicians and two Priests. &#xA0;This was the 6 members. &#xA0;Originally, this party had another Tanker, but he couldn&apos;t get on due to personal reasons.</span></p><p><span style="">This was the reason why they offered this deal.</span></p><p><span style="">They had been about to cancel the run. &#xA0;They had no choice, but to delay the battle until next time. &#xA0;That was when they discovered the Hahoe Mask, and there was no downside in offering a deal to him.</span></p><p><span style="">Moreover, they hadn&apos;t just broken even in this deal. &#xA0;They had hit the jackpot.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I told you a pretty face would work on him.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Of course, Queeng had the biggest role in making this deal happen, so she was proud as a peacock. &#xA0;Normally, the other party members would have laughed at her for referring to herself as a beauty, but they tried hard to suppress their laughter. &#xA0;They just nodded their heads.</span></p><p><span style="">However, the atmosphere turned for the worse one minute after they entered the Voodook&apos;s tunnel. &#xA0;There was a heavy atmosphere pressing down on them. &#xA0;They had temporarily become party members with the Hahoe Mask, but he didn&apos;t talk to the other members.</span></p><p><span style="">Of course, it wasn&apos;t a situation where a conversation was appropriate. &#xA0;They had entered the Voodook&apos;s tunnel, and they had work to do. &#xA0;This was an Instance Dungeon. &#xA0;They had no choice, but to keep going forward. &#xA0;The tunnel itself was getting smaller as time passed, and they had to eventually move in a single line.</span></p><p><span style="">When they arrived at the entrance to the Instance Dungeon, a short conversation began.</span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan was the one that opened up a dialogue.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;It is up to me as to when I want to step forward.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">His words shut down the dialogue in an instant.</span></p><p>6.</p><p><span style="">When they exited the tunnel, they arrived at a large pit that reminded one of the Colosseum.</span></p><p><span style="">At the center of the pit, there was a giant with a snake&apos;s head. &#xA0;It had the head of a snake, but its muscular body reminded one of an ogre. &#xA0;It wore a kilt made out of green leather, and there were various skulls hanging around its neck like a necklace.</span></p><p><span style="">Skull Collector! </span></p><p><span style="">Queeng was the first to get ready for the fight. &#xA0;She wore a bulky black armor, and she had an enormous shield that was as big as her body.</span></p><p><span style="">The Priests behind her had already placed 11 Buff Skills on her, and the Priest spoke the final phrase to her.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;In the name of the Holy Order.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Queeng heard the System Announcement when the twelfth Buff was placed on her.</span></p><p><span style="">[You&apos;ve received the blessing of the Holy Order.] </span></p><p><span style="">[All Buffs will be effective to twice its original time..] </span></p><p><span style="">[All Buffs will received 15% increase in effectiveness.] </span></p><p><span style="">Holy Order. </span></p><p><span style="">Buff Priests were a 2nd Advancement Class. &#xA0;When the one finished the Advancement, Priest received the blessing of the Holy Order. &#xA0;It was a dreamlike skill.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ok. &#xA0;You only live once.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">After receiving this dream-like skill, Queeng didn&apos;t hesitate to charge the enemy in front of her.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Charge!&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Queeng closed the distance in an instant, and she impacted the Skull Collector with her shield.</span></p><p><span style="">Kwahng!</span></p><p><span style="">The Skull Collector rolled backwards, and it immediately righted itself. &#xA0;Now it was the Skull Collector&apos;s turn. &#xA0;It jumped into the air, and it brought down its knife on Queeng&apos;s shield.</span></p><p><span style="">Kwah-ahng! </span></p><p><span style="">A loud sound exploded forth, and Queeng tried to find an opening as she endured the impact.</span></p><p><span style="">The Skeleton Collector used this opportunity to toss a skull in her general direction.</span></p><p><span style="">The skull rolled twice before the ground around it started to stir. It started forming arms, body and legs.</span></p><p><span style="">Ooh-uh-uh! </span></p><p><span style="">It appeared as it let out a long cry. &#xA0;It was a combination of a skull and a body of a Troll golem. &#xA0;It was 2 meters tall.</span></p><p><span style="">Puh-uhng! </span></p><p><span style="">An enormous fireball flew in, and the dirt Troll exploded as soon as it was formed. &#xA0;The aftermath of the explosion was so fierce that the backlash swept by the feet of the magicians and priests, who were keeping distance with the monster.</span></p><p><span style="">However, The magic only took out half its body. &#xA0;It started regaining its original shape.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Shit.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">The magician spoke a sullen curse as he started his next Magic Casting. </span></p><p><span style="">During all of this, the Skull Collector picked out another Skull from his necklace, and it threw the skull. </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Quickly catch the summoned familiars!&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Queeng let out a shout. &#xA0;The magicians and priest gritted their teeth, since Queeng had shouted in the game and the Voice Talk at the same time.</span></p><p><span style="">There was only one clear method known to the public right now.</span></p><p><span style="">While the Tanker face the Skull Collector, one had to defeat its summoned familiars one by one!</span></p><p><span style="">At first, many Users tried to kill it before the Skull Collector could use his Voodoo Summon Skill. &#xA0;However, the only one who had been able to succeed using this method was the Storm Queen. &#xA0;If one wasn&#x2019;t as skilled as the Storm Queen, it was impossible to kill it in a short amount of time.</span></p><p><span style="">This was why the next logical clear method was to get rid of all of its underlings. &#xA0;This method usually required two Tankers.</span></p><p><span style="">However, Queeng was the only Tanker in this group. &#xA0;This meant the three Magicians had to use all their firepower to prevent the summoned familiars from stacking in number.</span></p><p><span style="">Kwah-ahng! </span></p><p><span style="">The powerful magic continued to bombard the battlefield, and it was effective. &#xA0;The first summoned familiar fell as it couldn&#x2019;t take a third hit from the magic. &#xA0;It reverted into being a Skull.</span></p><p><span style="">However, a third summoned familiar had come into being already.</span></p><p><span style="">This was all still within expectation.</span></p><p><span style="">However, there was two things they hadn&#x2019;t expected.</span></p><p><span style="">The first one was the fact that the Hahoe Mask hadn&#x2019;t moved. &#xA0;He was just looking at the battlefield.</span></p><p><span style="">The other unexpected outcome was&#x2026;..</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Huhk!&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Queeng had been doing well blocking the powerful sword blows from the Skull Collector, but she couldn&#x2019;t properly block its parallel sword strike. &#xA0;She was sent flying.</span></p><p><span style="">Queeng flew like a bird as she was planted into the wall. &#xA0;At that moment, the three Magicians and two Priests were taken aback, but they moved at the same time.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ready the Range Magic!&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I&#x2019;ll erect a Firewall!&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">The Magicians readied their magic to buy some time.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I&#x2019;ll leave the rest to you.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Please give me a Haste Buff.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">One of the Priest put his life on the line as he ran through the battlefield. &#xA0;He was trying to reach Queeng. </span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan was trying to hold back a laugh.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;As expected, they aren&#x2019;t skilled enough for me to remember them.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan took off his gloves as he thought this.</span></p>
