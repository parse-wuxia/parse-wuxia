<p>Chapter 174 &#x2013; Red Desert (1)</p><p><span style="">[This place is north of the Highwood Forest where the Wood Devils appear. &#xA0;It is called the Red Desert. &#xA0;Until now, no one has able to approach this unknown region.] </span></p><p><span style="">A User appeared within the footage. &#xA0;After he gave a brief explanation, the User turned to look at the Red Desert spread behind him. &#xA0;Then he pointed towards what he was seeing. </span></p><p><span style="">[It feels like I&apos;m on mars. &#xA0;However, this place has a characteristic that is more interesting than its appearance. &#xA0;Please look over here.] </span></p><p><span style="">The view was tilted downwards towards the floor. &#xA0;One could see the feet of the man standing atop the red sands. &#xA0;The man stomped with his foot as if he was knocking on the floor.</span></p><p><span style="">When one watched the footage, one would expected the desert or the sand box to let out a soft sound when the foot came down. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">Tahng tahng!</span></p><p><span style="">However, the red sand beneath the User&apos;s foot made a sound akin to what a steel would make.</span></p><p><span style="">The man didn&apos;t end his actions there. &#xA0;He quickly unsheathed his sword from his waist, and he stabbed his sword towards the ground. &#xA0;The sword descended fast, and after letting out a violent sound, only the tip of the sword penetrated between the grains of sand. </span></p><p><span style="">[As you can see, this place is a desert. &#xA0;However, when you operate in this region, you should treat this place as a world made out of concrete. &#xA0;This holds true for the rest of the Red Desert you can see right now. &#xA0;These sands look like they are flowing like river water, but in truth, it could be treated as a very light layer of sand moving atop a material akin to concrete. &#xA0;This is a game. &#xA0;It is an awesome setting for one to experience in a virtual reality.] </span></p><p><span style="">The User finally appeared in full inside the footage, and the man started to move. &#xA0;The screen started to move with the man. &#xA0;The man walked towards something large, and he stopped in front of it.</span></p><p><span style="">There was a snake in front of the man. &#xA0;It was an enormous snake, and the snake looked bizarre in several ways. &#xA0;Snakes usually had scales that looked slick with oil, but this snake&apos;s skin looked very hard. &#xA0;It looked like a bug&#x2019;s carapace, and the glossy sheen made it look like an exoskeleton. &#xA0;However, the most surprising part was the fact that the snake&apos;s body was half buried in the sand. </span></p><p><span style="">The User opened his mouth again.</span></p><p><span style="">[However, if you decide to hunt here, the awesome setting I described earlier is actually a very horrific setting. &#xA0;Wait until this guy comes out or please run away. &#xA0;If you are pulled below the ground, prepare yourself for a vacation. The Tankers have to on alert.]</span></p><p><span style="">In a flash, the mood within the footage changed. &#xA0;The screen started to shake as if it was really being filmed by a handheld camera.</span></p><p><span style="">[Shit! &#xA0;It appeared again!] </span></p><p><span style="">[Prepare for battle! &#xA0;Prepare for battle!] </span></p><p><span style="">[Don&apos;t get dragged in! &#xA0;The Tankers have to be especially vigilant!] </span></p><p><span style="">Within the shaking footage, desperate voices could be heard. &#xA0;After a while, the footage stabilized, and the User spoke directly to the viewers watching the video.</span></p><p><span style="">[I&apos;ll end it here. &#xA0;This is Big Smiles guild&apos;s Sinclair.] </span></p><p><span style="">The video ended.</span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan, who had been caught up by the video, was finally able to freely move his gaze. &#xA0;Hyrkan moved his gaze as he lifted his head to look in front of him. Hyrkan saw the same monster from the video right in front of his eyes. &#xA0;The Sand Snake&apos;s corpse had been dismantled, and it was in the process of slowly melting away.</span></p><p><span style="">Ddul-goo-ruhk, ddul-goo-ruhk&#xB7;&#xB7;&#xB7;&#xB7;&#xB7;&#xB7;. </span></p><p><span style="">There were two Skeleton Knights on Skeleton Steeds around the Sand Snake. They looked forbidding as they moved slowly. &#xA0;It looked as if they were on guard. &#xA0;Both of the Skeleton Knights were showing a bold front, yet Hyrkan didn&apos;t feel good looking at them. &#xA0;His foul mood was inevitable.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;The Skeleton Knight was taken down in a single...&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">When he arrived at the Red Desert, it was as if the Sand Snake had been waiting for Hyrkan. &#xA0;He immediately came across the most famous monster inside the Red Desert.</span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan decided to answer the Sand Snake&apos;s welcome. &#xA0;He gave it Skeleton Fragments as gifts for coming into its house.</span></p><p><span style="">The battle itself wasn&apos;t too bad. &#xA0;The Sand Snake&apos;s exoskeleton was hard as it looked. &#xA0;On the other hand, the monster didn&apos;t have any Special Abilities. &#xA0;The Skeleton Warriors were trained well enough to fight in a melee with the Sand Snake. &#xA0;Then there were the Skeleton Knights strengthened using the Legendary Rank Ancient Power. &#xA0;With the help of the Skeleton Knights on their Skeleton Steeds, the Sand Snake wasn&apos;t a difficult opponent.</span></p><p><span style="">Moreover, the [Corrosive Ghost] Skill effect worked very well on this monster. &#xA0;Hyrkan had a Transcendent Rank Ancient Power leftover inside his storage, so he had used it on the [Skeleton Science] Skill. &#xA0;The [Corrosive Ghost] Skill had become much stronger, and it quickly weakened the exoskeleton of the Sand Snake. &#xA0;Thanks to the recently purchased [Cursed Doll] Skill, it was easy to inflict the Curse.</span></p><p><span style="">The early portion of the battle was so easy that it made Hyrkan surprised.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Of course, there is nothing easy inside this game.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">In a flash, the Sand Snake suddenly grabbed onto the Skeleton Knight. &#xA0;After biting the Skeleton Knight, who was wailing away at the Sand Snake, the ground sunk inwards. &#xA0;The Skeleton Knight was killed.</span></p><p><span style="">Instantaneous Death.</span></p><p><span style="">Results that usually never happened to his Skeleton underlings occurred.</span></p><p><span style="">Afterwards, he entered into another battle with a Sand Snake. &#xA0;In the process, two Skeleton Warriors suffered the same fate as the Skeleton Knight.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;I get what they were trying to do. &#xA0;Still, the Skeleton Knight atop the Skeleton Steed is immense. &#xA0;How does it make any sense that it could be dragged underground like that?&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">After assessing the battle again, Hyrkan clicked his tongue in dismay.</span></p><p><span style="">This wasn&apos;t an insignificant loss that could be glossed over.</span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan couldn&apos;t summon the Skeleton Knights indefinitely. &#xA0;The Skeleton Knight suffering an instantaneous death was a very big loss for him.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;I think the Golems might be the only ones that can tank the Sand Snake.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">Of course, he had to change his tactics from the norm. &#xA0;He couldn&apos;t use the Skeleton Knights as hybrid Tankers and Strikers. &#xA0;For tanking, he would have to send out a big Golem.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;My magical consumption would be too large.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">In the end, that was the problem.</span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan didn&apos;t use the Golems as his main troops not, because they were weak. &#xA0;The Golems were strong. &#xA0;However, the cost of summoning was too large to use them against normal monsters. &#xA0;Basically, if one took out a Golem in a fight where one Skeleton Knight would suffice, one was killing a chicken with a butcher&#x2019;s knife meant for a cow.</span></p><p><span style="">Moreover, everything Hyrkan did here was costing money. &#xA0;It wasn&apos;t as if there was an infinite number of consumables he could use. &#xA0;If his consumption was too fast, it would restrict the number of hours he could operate here.</span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan looked up at the sky.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;I can&apos;t fly around....&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">The best option would be to fly on the Bone Wyvern without getting into any battles as he looked for his destination. &#xA0;However, Warlord didn&apos;t permit such an easy method.</span></p><p><span style="">The Riding Skill could be used only if one had a destination in mind. &#xA0;The destination had to be a colonized region like the Heard Fortress ruin town.</span></p><p><span style="">Of course, it was ok to mount it. &#xA0;However, it was impossible to control it. &#xA0;In the case of the Bone Wyvern, it just stood on the ground during non-combat situations. &#xA0;It only moved when the battle started. &#xA0;Moreover, it was suicide to ride a Bone Wyvern into a battle.</span></p><p><span style="">This was why he had to walk around this place.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Shit.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">Of course, he would have to continue to walk. &#xA0;He would have to leave behind his footprints on this hell-like Red Desert.</span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan, who had been looking up at the sky, lowered his head.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Yes. &#xA0;Let&apos;s see who wins.&#x2019;</span></p><p>2.</p><p><span style="">[Your level has increased.] </span></p><p><span style="">[The Skill Proficiency for the Iron Golem Skill has risen to Rank D.] </span></p><p><span style="">[The Skill Proficiency for the Bone Dragon Skill has risen to Rank D.] </span></p><p><span style="">The Level Up Announcement was heard, but the Announcement didn&apos;t register in Hyrkan&apos;s ears.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Battle Completed!&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan ignored the Red Scorpion he had just caught. &#xA0;He turned his head, then he started to run.</span></p><p><span style="">He just ran.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Fucking hell!&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">As Hyrkan ran, harsh cuss words flowed out his mouth. &#xA0;A forest was seen far into the distance.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;I&apos;ve finally found it!&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">It was a forest filled with trees that rivaled ones seen in the Highwood Forest. &#xA0;This forest was beyond being silent. &#xA0;It felt dreary. &#xA0;It welcomed the visitors with an atmosphere that was quite different from the Red Desert.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;If I hadn&#x2019;t found this today, it would have driven me nuts.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">He had spent 10 days within the Red Desert, and he spent to extra days in locating this place. &#xA0;This was his first success on this trip.</span></p><p><span style="">The hardship endured by Hyrkan for the past 12 days was beyond imagination. &#xA0;The environment tested the Users in a different way. &#xA0;It didn&apos;t allow for breaks, and one had to be always vigilant. &#xA0;The time spent inside the Red Desert felt longer. &#xA0;A 10 minute span spent inside the Red Desert felt twice as long as any other region.</span></p><p><span style="">Moreover, he had found his target destination only when the Consumable Items stored in his body was almost all gone.</span></p><p><span style="">If he hadn&apos;t found the location today, he had no choice, but to head back. &#xA0;Of course, Hyrkan&apos;s eyes were about to flip over at his current situation.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;All right. &#xA0;I don&apos;t care what comes out. &#xA0;Even if it is a Zombie, I&apos;ll kiss it!&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan approached the forest with a happy heart, and Hyrkan was able to have his long awaited encounter.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Do not approach this place dead human. &#xA0;I&apos;ll forgive your trespass only once. &#xA0;If you return to this place again, even your corpse won&apos;t survive the encounter.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">It was an Elf with red colored skin.</span></p><p><span style="">[You&apos;ve gained the title &apos;The First to Encounter the Red Elf Tribe&apos;.] </span></p><p><span style="">[Quest &#x2018;Elf&apos;s Artifact&#x2019; has started.] </span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Fucking hell!&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan&apos;s headlong charge, which even Anugas wasn&apos;t able to stop, came to a full stop at this moment.</span></p><p>3.</p><p><span style="">Poohk! </span></p><p><span style="">A sword was lodged within the Voodoo Lizardman&apos;s neck like an axe embedded in wood. &#xA0;The Voodoo Lizardman&apos;s body shook.</span></p><p><span style="">However, the only ally of the Voodoo Lizardman couldn&apos;t give any help.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;We&#x2019;ve cleared the Zombies!&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;You just have to kill that one now.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">There were two other Users. &#xA0;A man and a woman cleared the Zombies. &#xA0;Surprisingly, all 10 Zombies had been summoned. &#xA0;The last Zombie was killed, and none of the Zombies were able to repair itself.</span></p><p><span style="">The User kept his sword lodged inside the Voodoo Lizardman, but when he heard their words, he retrieved his sword. &#xA0;He stopped prolonging the fight.</span></p><p><span style="">Poo-hwaht! </span></p><p><span style="">Blood sprayed out from the Voodoo Lizardman&apos;s neck. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">Goo-roo! &#xA0;Goo-roo!</span></p><p><span style="">The sound of its dying breaths could be heard.</span></p><p><span style="">Puhk!</span></p><p><span style="">As the User retrieved his sword, he kicked the ankle of the Voodoo Lizardman with his foot. &#xA0;It fell in an instant. &#xA0;Before the fallen Voodoo Lizardman could let out a cry through its opened mouth, the tip of the sword fell.</span></p><p><span style="">Poohk!</span></p><p><span style="">This strike allowed the ragged Voodoo Lizardman to meet its death.</span></p><p><span style="">When the short death cry ended, the three Users all heard the same Announcement.</span></p><p><span style="">[You&apos;ve killed the 100th Voodoo Lizardman.] </span></p><p><span style="">[You&apos;ve fulfilled the requirement for the Quest &apos;Barley Tribe&apos;s Request&apos;.] </span></p><p><span style="">The two Users raised both their hands into the air when they heard the Announcement.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;We&apos;ve finally caught 100 of them!&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I really thought this Quest was ridiculous, but we&#x2019;ve finally finished it! &#xA0;Ooh-ha-ha!&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">The two Users looked very happy. &#xA0;Whistling, who had killed the Voodoo Lizardman, let out a happy smile. &#xA0;His face was harsh, so even his smile looked very scary. He looked at the two with the smile on his face. &#xA0;It wouldn&apos;t have been rude to flinch backwards, since his smile was terrifying. &#xA0;However, the two had seen his smile before, so they were unsurprised.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Shall we go immediately?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;We should go immediately!&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">The two Users were like dogs running over to Whistling to beg for a walk.</span></p><p><span style="">Whistling spoke to the two.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Let&apos;s rest a little bit.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Then we&#x2019;ll butcher our kills.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;You dismantle the Zombies. &#xA0;I&#x2019;ll dismantle the Lizardman.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hey. &#xA0;Why do I have to be stuck with such an unpleasant task?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Did you forget I&#x2019;m a Crusader? &#xA0;The Undead monsters melt at my touch.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;That reason is valid only during our hunts. &#xA0;It has no effect during the dismantling.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Eh-ee. &#xA0;Let me live out my character. &#xA0;If I was in a fantasy novel, the zombies would melt at my touch, and the loot would disappear.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;You&#x2019;re nuts.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">The two ignored Whistling, who was in front of them. &#xA0;They bickered with each other then they turned their heads away as they dismantled the corpses.</span></p><p><span style="">Whistling had a light smile on his face as he watched them.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;They are an interesting duo.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">Whistling thought about the day when he met those two for the first time.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;I never expected to find people like me inside the Hydra guild.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">The memory started when the Fighters guild were purchased by the Hydra guild. &#xA0;At that time, the mood within the Fighters guild was celebratory. &#xA0;Most of the Fighters guild members would be immediately inducted into one of the 30 great guilds, so very few Users had complaints.</span></p><p><span style="">Whistling was one of the few, who was troubled by the move. &#xA0;He started to think about whether he should leave the Hydra guild or not. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">He didn&#x2019;t have any negative feelings towards the Hydra guild. &#xA0;However, their policy was the problem. &#xA0;Whistling had been given a very long leash inside the Fighters guild, but he didn&#x2019;t think the Hydra guild would give him the same type of freedom.</span></p><p><span style="">Moreover, he didn&#x2019;t think the Hydra guild would leave an asset like him alone.</span></p><p><span style="">However, the Hydra guild gave a proposal to Whistling before he could speak to them.</span></p><p><span style="">The Hydra guild had Quest Task Forces within its rank. &#xA0;If Whistling wanted to, he could pursue the Quests of his choice. &#xA0;Moreover, they would give him full cooperation at a guild level, which will allow him to quickly progress in his Quests.</span></p><p><span style="">Whistling thought over it, and he gave his answer.</span></p><p><span style="">He decided to try it out!</span></p><p><span style="">If he didn&#x2019;t like it, he could always leave the guild at a later time!</span></p><p><span style="">This was when he met the two Users in front of him. &#xA0;One was a Monk, who had gone through 2nd Advancement, to become a Crusader. &#xA0;His name was Yojori. &#xA0;Then there was Joba. &#xA0;After going through her 2nd Advancement, she had chosen the Class of Magic Swordsman. &#xA0;It was a Class that was as rare as the Lich.</span></p><p><span style="">These two Users were in the same category as Whistling.</span></p><p><span style="">The were skilled weirdoes. &#xA0;They weren&apos;t playing this game to achieve endless Spec ups. &#xA0;They were here to enjoy the game.</span></p><p><span style="">Moreover...</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Anyways, if we finish this Elf tribe&#x2019;s Quest, will we finally be able to meet the Red Elves?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Of course. &#xA0;That&#x2019;s what the hint said.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I can&#x2019;t wait for it. &#xA0;What will the Red Elves look like? &#xA0;I&#x2019;m pretty sure they&#x2019;ll have red skin, so their presence would feel different from others.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;They&#x2019;ll be pretty.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;You only care about beauty?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;How about you? &#xA0;I bet you only care about how handsome they are.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hmmph. &#xA0;Handsomeness by itself isn&#x2019;t that important. &#xA0;One to be handsome in a solemn manner like the Chieftain of Drah.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Your tastes seems really perverted.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;How about you? &#xA0;Last time, I saw your gaze linger on the young Elves.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;N...No way! &#xA0;Bitch! &#xA0;Are you trying to get me locked up!&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Isn&#x2019;t your reaction a bit weird?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I said no! &#xA0;How about you? &#xA0;When you went to the Frozen Lands, you took several hundred pictures of Bagle!&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;All women would understand my action. &#xA0;Our basic tastes run the same.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">They really liked Elves.</span></p><p><span style="">Whistling laughed when he heard their conversation. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">Unlike him, these two had always had the pleasure of playing with each other. &#xA0;Whistling had fun playing this game, but at times, he did feel lonely. &#xA0;Their presence was a big boost to his game play.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;It makes me think of that guy.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">At that moment, he received a message.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Huh?&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">It wasn&#x2019;t strange for him to receive a message, but Whistling became surprised when he saw who had sent it.</span></p><p><span style="">He immediately read the message, and he put on a serious expression.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;How interesting. &#xA0;So this is how&#xB7;&#xB7;&#xB7;&#xB7;&#xB7;&#xB7;.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">Whistling spoke towards the still bickering Yojori and Joba.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Let me ask you guys a question..&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">The two immediately stopped their war of words.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;You can ask me two questions.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Then you can ask me three.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Does anyone here have a bad relationship with the Hahoe Mask?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">For the first time, the two noisy Users shut their mouths.</span></p>
