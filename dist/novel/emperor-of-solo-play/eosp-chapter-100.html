<p><span style="">Chapter 100 - Cursed Domain(4)</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Do you want me to sever your wrist and take your watch? &#xA0;Or do you want to keep your wrist by giving your watch voluntarily to me? &#xA0;Which one would you prefer?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I...I&apos;ll give it to you.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Since I&apos;ve received your watch, what about the toll fee?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What? Toll fee?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Don&apos;t you want to get past me alive? &#xA0;If you want to get past me, then of course, I would have to receive a toll fee.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I don&apos;t have any gold right now&#x2026;&#x2026;.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I can take Ingredient Coins or Ingredient Gems. If you don&apos;t have those either, you can get a loan. &#xA0;Don&apos;t you have a lot of comrades you can get a loan from? &#xA0;Also, you two over there.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Us two?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Since the two of you didn&apos;t even think about attacking me, I won&apos;t take your watches. &#xA0;Instead, you&apos;ll have to give me a toll fee.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;W...we have to give you money too?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;It is a conscientious price of 100 gold.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Can you cut us some slack? &#xA0;We didn&apos;t do anything.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Please cut us some slack. &#xA0;We are women...&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Women? So what? It isn&apos;t as if you girls will date me just because I let you girls go. &#xA0;So why should I let you girls off the hook?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;So if we go out with you...&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ah, sorry. &#xA0;I&apos;ll turn down that offer. &#xA0;The two of you aren&apos;t my cup of tea. Maybe someone will be your white knight? &#xA0;Ah. &#xA0;What do I mean by white knight? I&apos;m asking if anyone here would pay instead of the ladies here.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Zeet couldn&apos;t believe what was unfolding in front of his eyes. &#xA0;He looked on with an absent-minded expression.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;My god.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">This had happened in an instant.</span></p><p><span style="">The process of defeating Viol happened in an instant. &#xA0;Moreover, the events that happened afterwards also unfolded in an instant.</span></p><p><span style="">The other party didn&apos;t have a good mix of members. &#xA0;There was a Magician, Priest and Swordsman. The party wasn&apos;t made up in a way where they could gang up on a single opponent. &#xA0;In truth, the party had only one Swordsman.</span></p><p><span style="">The Swordsman User wasn&apos;t able to put up a proper fight. </span></p><p><span style="">Kah-ahng!</span></p><p><span style="">When the two swords clashed, the Swordsman User&apos;s sword bounced off. &#xA0;At the same time, he had lost his balance. &#xA0;This was the result of being overwhelmed by the opponent&#x2019;s Strength Stat.</span></p><p><span style="">Of course, when the Swordsman User was stabbed in the eyes, he was afflicted by the Blind effect. &#xA0;Afterwards, the Swordsman User had become a meat shield. &#xA0;Instead of buying time for his Magician, he was used as a shield. &#xA0;The Magician let out the words, &quot;Uh uh? Uh uh!&quot;, before he was subdued. &#xA0;The Magician&apos;s arms and legs were cut. </span></p><p><span style="">When the Magician and Swordsman was subdued, a Priest didn&apos;t really have any other choice.</span></p><p><span style="">This was how the previous conversation had started.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;I never thought I would personally witness such a thing.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">It was common to see a single person fight multiple opponents in Warlord. &#xA0;This was a game. &#xA0;If one&apos;s Spec was overwhelmingly high, a single person could fight against several dozen people.</span></p><p><span style="">However, the current situation wasn&apos;t the result of differences in Spec. The opponents had been crushed by strength, but something felt different. It felt as if something much stronger had crushed them. &#xA0;It wasn&apos;t correct to say it was solely the difference in strength. &#xA0;Was it a difference in temperament? This was a feeling one would get when one saw a tiger tear apart a rabbit.</span></p><p><span style="">In that context, this was a hard sight to swallow.</span></p><p><span style="">Of course, Zeet had seen videos that was similar to what he was seeing.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;It isn&apos;t as if he is the Hahoe Mask....&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">Hahoe Mask. </span></p><p><span style="">His battle style was similar to the Hahoe Mask.</span></p><p><span style="">Moreover, the sand toss was one of Hahoe Mask&apos;s go-to move. In recent days, the Hahoe Mask didn&apos;t use the sand toss any more. However, his early fans were a very passionate about the Hahoe Mask&apos;s sand toss. Many people became his fan, because of that move.</span></p><p><span style="">While Zeet was watching with a slack-jawed expression, the situation was resolved.</span></p><p><span style="">The Swing guild members settled each of their account, and they left. &#xA0;Finally, Zeet approached his partner.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Maybe I should have asked each of them for 200 gold...&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">A chill ran up Zeet&apos;s back when he heard his partner talk to himself.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;What will happen if the Block Field doesn&apos;t open after the Quest is completed? &#xA0;Do I really have to give him money?&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">Accompanying the anxiety, he was truly worried about what would happen.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Is it really ok to act like this? I&apos;m sure they&apos;ll come back for revenge.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Zeet had fallen out with the Swing guild, and he was still paying the price for it. &#xA0;Swing guild wasn&apos;t that great of a guild, but it was powerful enough to suppress a single User. &#xA0;They had committed the first transgression, yet they weren&#x2019;t virtuous enough to admit that they were wrong in the first place.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Don&apos;t worry about it. At their level, they won&apos;t even be able to get a queue ticket to face me.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">His partner had dismissive expression on his face regarding Zeet&apos;s worries.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Zeet replied with a question, but his partner didn&apos;t elaborate on his answer.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Anyways, let&apos;s move quickly. &#xA0;I don&apos;t want to unnecessarily get caught up in an annoying business. &#xA0;It seems the other side picked up on what we are doing.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ah!&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Zeet finally came to his senses.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes. &#xA0;We have to move quickly.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">His partner&apos;s words were correct. The Swing guild members, who were spared their lives, weren&apos;t dummies. &#xA0;They&apos;ll go request help from the other guild members. &#xA0;There were a considerable amount of Swing guild members around this region. &#xA0;Zeet personally knew over 10 members.</span></p><p><span style="">This was especially true since Viol had been taken down. &#xA0;They would surely try to get their revenge. &#xA0;Viol was someone that was pretty high up in terms of level in the Swing guild. &#xA0;This happened in any organization, but the way they treat someone depended on how much the member could contribute towards their organization.</span></p><p><span style="">This was reason enough to hurry up their pace.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Are you perhaps a fan of that person?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">During all of this, Zeet asked a question he was very curious about.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Who?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hahoe Mask.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What do you mean by that?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;No. &#xA0;I&apos;m just saying you have a similar fighting style as the Hahoe Mask. &#xA0;Ah. Of course, the Hahoe Mask is a Necromancer, and you are a Swordsman.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Zeet&apos;s partner just smirked at his answer. &#xA0;Of course, Zeet&apos;s partner didn&apos;t answer the question.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Let&apos;s hurry up.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">That was his partner&apos;s answer.</span></p><p><span style="">When one plays Warlord, sometimes it feels like one is putting pieces of a puzzle together.</span></p><p><span style="">This was how Zeet felt right now.</span></p><p><span style="">They diligently searched the hunting ground where the Sick Werewolves appeared. &#xA0;In the process, they found a clue.</span></p><p><span style="">As if black rain had fallen from the sky, there were black ink-like marks on the trees, rocks and ground. Moreover, anything that touched the black liquid wasn&apos;t doing well. In the case of the tree, the trees were shriveled up only where the black water was touching. &#xA0;The rocks and earth was corroded when in contact with the black liquid.</span></p><p><span style="">The black liquid was clearly the source of the problem.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;So this is why the Sick Werewolves appeared.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Moreover, there was a high probability that the reason why the Sick Werewolves were appearing instead of the normal Werewolves was the effect of the black liquid. &#xA0;In other words, it was highly likely that this place was the location they were looking for.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Let&apos;s just follow it. We can do the clean up later.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;All right.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">This was like following the breadcrumbs left by Hansel and Gretel. &#xA0;Zeet and his partner followed the black marks. &#xA0;After traveling for awhile, they found a small hidden cave hidden between the foliages.</span></p><p><span style="">Moreover, there was a Black Skeleton within the cave. &#xA0;It was praying with its hands clasped like a high priest.</span></p><p><span style="">It was the Blackened Remains.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;This is why no one was able to find it. &#xA0;Who would have thought it would be here? &#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">When Zeet found it, he spoke in a despondent manner, then he immediately lowered his head.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Fucking hell.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">He couldn&apos;t help, but curse inside.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;I worked like a dog for over two month to be able to see this shabby Skeleton...&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">It looked like a worthless Skeleton. &#xA0;In truth, what person likes a skeleton? &#xA0;Skeletons were always an ominous symbol. &#xA0;Yet he had spent two month to find this Skeleton.</span></p><p><span style="">It was apt to describe it as him working like a dog. &#xA0;From other people&apos;s perspective, he had basically wasted two month. &#xA0;From Zeet&apos;s perspective, it felt as if he had dug a hole for two months. &#xA0;It wasn&apos;t funny.</span></p><p><span style="">However, at that moment, he felt an emotion that he had only felt when he began playing Warlord.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Still, this is a first.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">No one had been able to accomplish this. &#xA0;Countless number of people had given up on this Quest, and he was the first one to complete it. &#xA0;He wouldn&apos;t characterize it as coming in 1st place, but it was a monumental moment for him.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Thank you.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Zeet&apos;s partner shrugged his shoulders when he heard Zeet speak.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;We can exchange pleasantries later. However, there&apos;s something I&apos;d like you to keep in mind.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Keep in mind?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;If we break open this Quest and the Block Field isn&apos;t gone, then you&apos;ll have to a choice to make like those Swing guild members.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Zeet smirked at those words. &#xA0;He laughed as he replied.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;You really are a strange bastard.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">His partner shrugged his shoulder. &#xA0;Zeet didn&apos;t take his words to be a threat. &#xA0;He thought his partner was playing with his words. &#xA0;Of course, his partner might be warning him in truth, but Zeet didn&apos;t care in the end.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;All right. &#xA0;If it doesn&#x2019;t come down, I&apos;ll give you the money. &#xA0;I&apos;ll give you a thousand gold.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">As he spoke, Zeet carefully picked up the Skeleton. &#xA0;When Zeet&apos;s hands touched the Skeleton, everything except the skull disintegrated into dust.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Uh? What the hell?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;It must have eroded.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;D...does this mean we failed the Quest?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Since the skull is the only thing left, it means we should take it. &#xA0;We just have to escort it to where it wanted to go.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Zeet came to his sense when he heard the word &apos;escort&apos;.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Ah.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">It was time to part ways. &#xA0;Zeet felt a sense of loss.</span></p><p><span style="">Zeet hadn&apos;t made any comrades up until now. &#xA0;It was true that a part of the reason why no one wanted to play with him was the fact that Zeet wasn&apos;t exceptionally skilled. &#xA0;However, the biggest obstacle had been the fact that Zeet was annoyed by the other Users.</span></p><p><span style="">What kind of game would it be if one only focused on leveling up and hunting? One had to enjoy the game itself for it to be a game for him. &#xA0;He wasn&apos;t interested in hunting like a mad man to become the best. &#xA0;That was a minor part of the game for him. &#xA0;It was pointless.</span></p><p><span style="">This line of thought discouraged the need to find a comrade.</span></p><p><span style="">However, for the first time he had found a User, who he wanted to play the game with. Regrettably, it wouldn&#x2019;t be possible.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;At a glance, he is an expert, who had hid his level. &#xA0;There is no way he would want to play the game with me.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">He had caught on awhile ago. &#xA0;He realized that his partner wasn&apos;t a small fry like him.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes. &#xA0;Let&apos;s end this.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Zeet put on a smile.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;I want to play the game with a guy like this.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">In the future, Zeet would come to be known as the Quest Man. &#xA0;This was the moment that started it all.</span></p><p><span style="">It happened the moment Hyrkan reached the peak of Ricky Mountain. &#xA0;An Announcement was heard inside his ears.</span></p><p><span style="">[You gained the Title &apos;Person who Conquered the Peak of the Ricky Mountain&apos;.] </span></p><p><span style="">He was finally at the peak.</span></p><p><span style="">This meant the Block Field had been removed. &#xA0;Hyrkan raised his head to look at the lake that was located on the other side of the mountain.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;I invested 3 days on this.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">He had to dispel the Block Field. &#xA0;Without any plans, he had used up 3 days to open the door.</span></p><p><span style="">However, Hyrkan let out a sigh of relief instead of being frustrated.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;I&apos;m fortunate that there was guy like Zeet here.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">Zeet. </span></p><p><span style="">If he hadn&#x2019;t been here, he wouldn&apos;t have been able to finish the Quest in 3 days. &#xA0;This was why he didn&apos;t say his time had been wasted. &#xA0;He was actually thankful. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;I&apos;m really thankful for that guy.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">If Users like Zeet didn&apos;t exist, how much time would Hyrkan have had to spend in dispelling the Block Field by himself? One week? &#xA0;Maybe Hyrkan would have had to retire here.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Guys like him make Warlord go around.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">Zeet and Users like him were the small components located all over Warlord. They were willing to to the small detailed tasks, so the Warlord Users could advance.</span></p><p><span style="">The world was like a clock. &#xA0;There were large and expensive parts, but one won&apos;t be able to make the clock work with just those components. &#xA0;The small parts played a role that was as important as the large parts. &#xA0;The Rankers of the 30 great guilds determined the flow of Warlord, but in the end, Warlord was made up of regular Users.</span></p><p><span style="">Of course, this wasn&apos;t an important story for Hyrkan.</span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan didn&apos;t go too deep into his reverie. &#xA0;He wasn&apos;t in a situation where he would allow himself to fall into a reverie.</span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan harbored a suspicion.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;This doesn&apos;t match with the info I know.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">Cursed Domain.</span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan knew that this place was of low importance in the Immoral Prince section of the Main Quest.</span></p><p><span style="">[The Cursed Domain is where the the Immoral Prince carried out his experiments. &#xA0;This was the location where power of Corruption was exposed to the monsters through his experiments. &#xA0;It was also the location where the clue about the Immoral Prince could be found.] </span></p><p><span style="">This was all the facts Hyrkan knew about the Cursed Domain.</span></p><p><span style="">If he looked at the current situation, Hyrkan knew this wasn&apos;t a stage he could easily finish. &#xA0;This might take awhile.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;A barrier.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">If the scenario is as Zeet surmised, the barrier had been made by those who had run away from the Cursed Domain. &#xA0;On top of that, the Blackened Remains acquired by Zeet was the remain of the Magician that had been maintaining the barrier with his magic.</span></p><p><span style="">It wasn&apos;t a simple Block Field set in place by the System. &#xA0;There were a lot of cases where a Block Field was set by a Scenario. &#xA0;The Battlefield he had fought at the Terube castle wall was a prime example.</span></p><p><span style="">Moreover, if one crossed a Block Field linked to a Scenario, there was a pretty important Event Stage on the other side. &#xA0;For example, the Frozen Kingdom was across the Terube castle wall.</span></p><p><span style="">The heart of the problem was the fact that Hyrkan didn&apos;t have any information about that important stage.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;I&apos;m sure of it. &#xA0;Someone pocketed the Cursed Domain, and the information was never released.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">This meant the Users from the time before Hyrkan returned to the past had cleared the Cursed Domain, and they had never disclosed this fact to the public.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;This place is where level 140 monsters show up....&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">One would have to be at least level 140 to hunt at a hunting ground of this quality. &#xA0;The Event probably required a higher level than 140, yet he had never heard about it. &#xA0;There weren&apos;t many organizations that could cleanly swallow the whole event.</span></p><p><span style="">It could only be pulled off by the 30 great guilds and the Underfoot guilds. &#xA0;This meant there was a high chance the Cursed Domain held something very delicious. &#xA0;It was something worth hiding.</span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan organized his current situation.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;I don&apos;t have any information.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan had no idea what the Cursed Domain held.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Moreover, my level is only in the 120s.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">It wasn&#x2019;t entirely impossible for him to go to a level 140 hunting ground, but it wasn&apos;t an easy stage for him.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;I don&apos;t care if a dog or a cow shows up. &#xA0;However, I&#x2019;m sure it won&#x2019;t be an ordinary dog or cow.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">When such a stage opened, a dog or a cow would appear. &#xA0;However, the dog might be a trained attack dog instead of a normal dog. &#xA0;A bull could come out instead of a normal cow, and he would be the matador with no experience in facing these bulls.</span></p><p><span style="">These were the mountains Hyrkan would have to climb in the future.</span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan put on his Hahoe Mask and he smiled.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;This will be fun.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">Rumors in Warlord traveled faster than the wind.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Did you hear about it? The Block Field across Misandra&apos;s Castle was dispelled.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Over there? How?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;The Blackened Remains was found.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Who found it? &#xA0;I thought that Quest was a bug? &#xA0;I thought no one was able to find it?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;His name is Zeet. Anyways, he found it.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Rumors in Warlord was highly combustible. &#xA0;The fuse was lit immediately.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;So what&apos;s across the Block Field?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;The Users are disseminating information as they thoroughly search the mountain. &#xA0;However, it seems the place is crawling with unexpectedly strong monsters. &#xA0;The lowest level monsters are over level 140. &#xA0;The average level of the hunt is around level 150.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Level 150? &#xA0;That&apos;s incredible! I bet the Rankers are very interested in that place.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">When the fire burns hot, the flame sometimes make the person drunk.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Moreover, there is a rumor going around. &#xA0;The location might be an Event Stage and the reward is a Unique Item.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Think about it. &#xA0;It&apos;s a level 150 Event location, and the reward is a Unique item. &#xA0;Doesn&apos;t that mean the reard is a level 150 or higher Unique Item?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;A level 150 Unique item.... &#xA0;Wasn&apos;t there a recently sold Item like that?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;It was a Level 150 Unique Item that Dropped from the Blue Dragon Slime Raid. &#xA0;It was a Magic Wand. &#xA0;It was sold at 250,000 gold, but the sale was a dud. &#xA0;In the end, it was traded for a level 140 Full Unique Defensive Set.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;That&apos;s a ridiculous price. &#xA0;Two hundred fifty thousand gold....&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;The User backed out of the deal. &#xA0;He said he would rather use it than sell it for only 250,000 gold.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">They were drunk on the recent events, so &#xA0;they started talking nonsense.</span></p><p><span style="">This was how lies and rumors spread rapidly across Warlord.</span></p>
