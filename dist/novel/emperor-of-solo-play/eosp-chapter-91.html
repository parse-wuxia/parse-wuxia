What the hell are you doing?&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">The voice rang in his ear, but Hyrkan ignored it. &#xA0;He was focused solely on one thing. &#xA0;He concentrated on the being with pointy ears, who was running away with great agility.</p><p dir="ltr">- Hahoe Mask!&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">As if he was trying to interfere with Hyrkan, Pelato kept yelling out his name. &#xA0;In the end, Hyrkan spoke in a low voice as if he was mumbling.</p><p dir="ltr">&#x201C;Hey, you aren&apos;t in a position to yell at me. &#xA0;Just clean up the situation over there for now.&#x201D;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">- What? What are you talking about?&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Hyrkan&apos;s words were short on explanation. &#xA0;Pelato had a very natural reaction.</p><p dir="ltr">However, Hyrkan didn&apos;t have the time to give a long explanation. &#xA0;Moreover, there was no reason to. &#xA0;He wasn&apos;t required to do so.</p><p dir="ltr">&#x201C;If you don&apos;t like that option, I can reveal how you tried to fuck me over after being hired by the Apollo guild. &#xA0;Why don&apos;t you think about what would occur if that happens?&#x201D;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Pelato finally closed his mouth. &#xA0;Silence finally descended upon Hyrkan, and he once again put in all his effort to chase after the Elf.</p><p dir="ltr">The Elf was much slower than he thought it would be. &#xA0;The really swift Elves were impossible for users to follow in the forest. &#xA0;Hyrkan had prior experience in chasing after Elves, so he was well aware of this fact.</p><p dir="ltr">Hyrkan had a hunch.</p><p dir="ltr">&#x2018;It wants to be caught.&#x2019;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Warlord was cooperating with him, so he could smoothly progress in his Quest. &#xA0;It was very rare to receive cooperation from the game, since Warlord was usually an inhospitable game.</p><p dir="ltr">Of course, Hyrkan wasn&apos;t going to refuse the help. This kind of cooperation from the game was rare. &#xA0;If he refused such help here, a chance like this would never present itself to him again.</p><p dir="ltr">Still, it wasn&apos;t an easy task to catch the Elf. &#xA0;An average user would never be able to catch it. &#xA0;The speed wasn&apos;t the problem. &#xA0;The problem was the location. &#xA0;When one ran full force inside a forest, &#xA0;it was like running an obstacle course with a blindfold on.</p><p dir="ltr">&#x2018;All right. &#xA0;I&apos;ll catch you.&#x2019;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Hyrkan was experienced in running away from various people for his survival, so this wasn&apos;t a problem for him.</p><p dir="ltr">The distance between the two was steadily getting narrower. &#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Of course, the Elf realized this fact, and it suddenly turned its head. &#xA0;This was the first time Hyrkan had seen this Elf&apos;s face.</p><p dir="ltr">&#x2018;I knew it.&#x2019;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">The escaping elf&apos;s face was different from the faces of Elves he had seen before. There was a black tattoo on his face&#x2026;&#x2026; No, it looked more like a scar than a wound, and there was something black within it. &#xA0;The sense of beauty one felt when seeing an Elf couldn&apos;t be felt from this one.</p><p dir="ltr">Still, the Elf&apos;s eyes were striking. &#xA0;The Elves usually had emerald colored eyes, but its eyes were dyed black now. &#xA0;The contrast was too stark.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">He knew the definition of the word, but this sight made him clearly feel what the word, Corrupted, meant.</p><p dir="ltr">It also meant he had gotten close enough to be able to confirm the color of its eyes.</p><p dir="ltr">If things progressed along this line, Hyrkan would catch the Elf. &#xA0;This was Hyrkan&apos;s intention and choice.</p><p dir="ltr">Now it was up to the Elf to make its own choice.</p><p dir="ltr">Will it just let itself be caught? &#xA0;Or will it fight?</p><p dir="ltr">The Elf made a decision.</p><p dir="ltr">Poo-hoop!&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Suicide. &#xA0;This was the decision made by the Corrupted Elf. &#xA0;The Elf showed the intention of taking the truth to the grave. &#xA0;It wasn&apos;t going to tell anyone about his master&apos;s secrets.</p><p dir="ltr">The result of its choice became immediately apparent. &#xA0;The Elf threw up blood, and it fell like a puppet with its string cut. &#xA0;Its momentum made him roll couple dozen times across the ground, and his body was in rough shape.</p><p dir="ltr">Hyrkan bit his lips when he saw the sight.</p><p dir="ltr">It was an unpleasant sight. &#xA0;Moreover, he didn&apos;t like what he had to do now. &#xA0;He took out a pouch from his bosom. &#xA0;He had carried it around like a treasure.</p><p dir="ltr">The Elf glared at Hyrkan when he approached it. &#xA0;Hyrkan avoided the Elf&apos;s gaze. &#xA0;The Elf was sprawled out like a corpse, and Hyrkan poured the silver liquid on the Elf&apos;s head.</p><p dir="ltr">When the silver liquid touched the Elf&apos;s head, it took shape to fit around the Elf&apos;s head.</p><p dir="ltr">The Circlet of Purification!&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">The item started purifying the power of Corruption that had been dominating the Elf&apos;s nature and intellect.</p><p dir="ltr">There must have been a recoil. &#xA0;The corpse-like body of the Elf started to shake as if there was an earthquake.</p><p dir="ltr">Kool-luhk, kool-luhk!&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">The Elf suddenly threw up black liquid. &#xA0;Then it closed its eyes tight, and it let out a moan.</p><p dir="ltr">Eventually, the Elf opened its eyes again, and its emerald eyes were revealed. &#xA0;The power of Corruption that had been controlling the Elf was gone. &#xA0;This was the surest evidence that proved the Elf had regained its sanity.</p><p dir="ltr">The Elf&apos;s eyes looked at Hyrkan. &#xA0;Hyrkan didn&apos;t say anything. &#xA0;He waited for the Elf to speak. &#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">However, the Elf couldn&apos;t speak. &#xA0;It opened its mouth, but the sound of its voice never made it past its throat.</p><p dir="ltr">At that moment, it was as if the Elf had suddenly remembered something. &#xA0;The Elf squeezed out the last strength it had left to tap its left chest region with its hand.</p><p dir="ltr">That was it. &#xA0;After performing the minor movement with his hand, the Elf closed its eyes, and its body slumped. &#xA0;Its body immediately started to shrivel up like an old tree.</p><p dir="ltr">Hyrkan laughed bitterly as he saw this sight.</p><p dir="ltr">&#x2018;The game is quite romanticized. &#xA0;It really is a romanticized game.&#x2019;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">After letting out his bitter laugh, Hyrkan took out a note and map from the Elf&apos;s pocket.</p><p dir="ltr">&#xA0;2.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&#x2018;Shit.&#x2019;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">After ending the conversation with Hyrkan, Pelato looked around his surrounding. &#xA0;The nearby party members were staring at him. &#xA0;They were requesting for an answer from Pelato.</p><p dir="ltr">Pelato couldn&apos;t come up with anything.</p><p dir="ltr">&#x2018;What&apos;s should I say?&#x2019;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">The current situation was a mess.</p><p dir="ltr">An arrow had suddenly killed the Cockatrice when the group was about to kill it. &#xA0;Moreover, when the arrow flew in, Hyrkan had immediately chased after the being, who had shot the arrow.</p><p dir="ltr">In this situation, the rest of the party could only look on.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Moreover, wasn&apos;t Hyrkan the one who had been commanding the party up until now?</p><p dir="ltr">&#x2018;What does he want me to do?&#x2019;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Anyways, the ball was in Pelato&apos;s court now. &#xA0;He was the one, who had planned this Raid. &#xA0;If there was a problem, he had to take the responsibility.</p><p dir="ltr">Moreover, he was in a bad spot. Hyrkan knew his weak point. &#xA0;If this business became known to the Golden Brothers, Pelato would be unconditionally kicked out from the guild.</p><p dir="ltr">If it ended at an expulsion, he would be quite fortunate.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">However, if he was involved in a scandal, no guild would take him in. &#xA0;He would basically have to give up on this game. &#xA0;Without the help of a large guild, one couldn&apos;t progress in this world. This was the reality of Warlord these days.</p><p dir="ltr">At the very least, he had to bark when Hyrkan said for him to bark. &#xA0;Hyrkan said Pelato had to take care of this matter, so he had to take care of this matter.</p><p dir="ltr">&#x201C;Didn&apos;t everyone get their EXP?&#x201D;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">At Pelato&apos;s words, everyone checked whether they gained their EXP or not.</p><p dir="ltr">&#x201C;We got it.&#x201D;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&#x201C;Isn&apos;t this much more than expected? &#xA0;I received a considerable amount.&#x201D;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Their EXP had increased. It basically meant everyone there had a claim to the monster.</p><p dir="ltr">&#x201C;Since we gained the EXP, the monster&apos;s corpse is owned by us.&#x201D;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">The rights to the Cockatrice&apos;s corpse was reserved for the Raid party.</p><p dir="ltr">They received EXP and the Items. &#xA0;They hadn&apos;t lost either one of them.</p><p dir="ltr">Pelato reinforced this point. &#xA0;There were some hiccups along the way, but the benefit they had targeted had been earned.</p><p dir="ltr">&#x201C;What about the Hahoe Mask?&#x201D;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Of course, he had to answer for the sudden disappearance of Hyrkan. &#xA0;The people gathered here weren&apos;t common users. &#xA0;Hyrkan had immediately responded to the situation. &#xA0;It meant Hyrkan had expected this to happen.</p><p dir="ltr">In other words, the party members wanted to know why they hadn&apos;t been told about the situation if Hyrkan knew events would turn out like this.</p><p dir="ltr">They wanted an explanation.</p><p dir="ltr">&#x201C;He has a Quest.&#x201D;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">After a brief brainstorm, Pelato came up with a short answer.</p><p dir="ltr">&#x201C;Hahoe Mask joined the raid in the first place, because it was part of his Quest. &#xA0;He is currently progressing in the Quest right now.&#x201D;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">The answer was plausible. &#xA0;After hearing the explanation, all the users nodded their head, and it seemed they had accepted it.</p><p dir="ltr">&#x2018;Now that I think about it the Hahoe Mask is quite far along the Main Scenario Quest.&#x2019;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&#x2018;Wait a moment. &#xA0;Does this mean this monster was related to the Main Scenario Quest? &#xA0;It is a Corrupted monster, so the possibility is high.&#x2019;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&#x2018;If I chase after the Hahoe Mask right now, will I be able to join his Main Scenario Quest? &#xA0;Should I chase after him?&#x2019;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">The party members started to think about how they could interject themselves into the current scenario. &#xA0;The commotion within the group lessened.</p><p dir="ltr">Pelato, who had been looking at the party members, swallowed the sigh that was about to come out.</p><p dir="ltr">&#x2018;This is all tangled up.&#x2019;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">He had given the obvious answer, but the answer he had given wasn&apos;t advantageous to Pelato.</p><p dir="ltr">He had made another mess. &#xA0;Pelato had implied there was a prior agreement with Hyrkan, yet that wasn&apos;t true. &#xA0;If Hyrkan disputed his words, Pelato would be labeled a liar.</p><p dir="ltr">&#x2018;Now I&apos;m at the mercy of the Hahoe Mask no matter what.&#x2019;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">A equals B.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Their relationship crystallized at that moment.</p><p dir="ltr">3.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">When Hyrkan returned, the Cockatrice&apos;s body had been dismantled, and it had already melted away.</p><p dir="ltr">Hyrkan immediately held a conversation with Pelato at an isolated location.</p><p dir="ltr">&#x201C;You received consumable items from the Apollo guild. &#xA0;How much do you have left?&#x201D;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&#x201C;Quite a lot.&#x201D;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&#x201C;Since you tried to fuck me over, you should give that to me as a repayment.&#x201D;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Pelato let out a sigh inside as he heard Hyrkan&apos;s words. There were a lot of consumable items left, because Hyrkan had directed the Raid. &#xA0;If one put a price on those items, it was quite a lot. Yet Hyrkan wanted it all?</p><p dir="ltr">It was a waste, but he had no choice.</p><p dir="ltr">&#x201C;All right. &#xA0;I&apos;ll agree to that.&#x201D;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Currently, Hyrkan was holding Pelato&apos;s life line. &#xA0;Pelato fervently wished Hyrkan wouldn&apos;t ask for anything bigger.</p><p dir="ltr">&#x201C;Also&#x2026;&#x2026;.&#x201D;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">However, Hyrkan wasn&apos;t done speaking. &#xA0;Pelato bit his lips before he even heard what Hyrkan was going to say.</p><p dir="ltr">&#x201C;You can keep all the merits regarding this Raid, Pelato.&#x201D;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&#x201C;What?&#x201D;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">At that moment Pelato couldn&apos;t believe what he had just heard.</p><p dir="ltr">&#x201C;Are you saying you will allow me to take credit for the result of today&apos;s Raid? &#xA0;Is that what you mean?&#x201D;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Hyrkan nodded his head.</p><p dir="ltr">&#x201C;H...how come?&#x201D;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">This was most definitely to his advantage, yet Pelato started asking questions in suspicion instead of thanking Hyrkan.</p><p dir="ltr">He expected to be beat, yet a sweet piece of chocolate had been put into his mouth. &#xA0;In some aspect, his reaction was to be expected.</p><p dir="ltr">&#x201C;I have no reason to ruin everything for you. &#xA0;I&apos;ll summarize it for you. You tried to kill me at the request of the Apollo guild, and I found out about it mid-raid. &#xA0;During the raid, you did nothing, and I commanded the Raid. &#xA0;Now that I have your weak-point I don&apos;t have a reason to blab about it.&#x201D;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">From Pelato&apos;s perspective, the arrangement wasn&apos;t that ideal. &#xA0;However, Pelato didn&apos;t frown.</p><p dir="ltr">Hyrkan added more to the explanation.</p><p dir="ltr">&#x201C;As you probably know by know, I have a lot of enemies. &#xA0;In such a situation, what would I gain by embarassing a skilled user from the Golden Brothers?&#x201D;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&#x201C;I...I guess so.&#x201D;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&#x201C;Moreover, it isn&apos;t as if I&apos;ll make any money from embarrassing you. &#xA0;It&apos;ll just created a rift between the Golden Brothers and me.&#x201D;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Pelato quickly nodded his head.</p><p dir="ltr">At that moment...</p><p dir="ltr">&#x201C;All right. &#xA0;You can keep the footage of this raid.&#x201D;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Hyrkan had given him a big present.</p><p dir="ltr">&#x2018;Huhk!&#x2019;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Pelato forgot about the mess he was in, and he had a surprised expression on his face. &#xA0;He looked ridiculous from an outside point of view.</p><p dir="ltr">This demonstrated how big of a present he had been given by Hyrkan.</p><p dir="ltr">No matter how you looked at it the Boss Monster Raid footage had a lot of value. &#xA0;Most footage brought in small amount of money, but it one was lucky, it could net a lot of money. &#xA0;Moreover, the Corrupted Gray Cockatrice that had appeared at the Red Lake was an attractive Boss monster.</p><p dir="ltr">Also, this footage could be put into his resume. &#xA0;This Raid wasn&apos;t done with the experienced members of a large guild. &#xA0;This was an attack party made out of random volunteers. &#xA0;He had formed the party, and he had shown off his ability to lead such a party. &#xA0;This could be a feather in Pelato&#x2019;s cap. &#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Of course, the latter half of the Raid was commanded by Hyrkan. &#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">If Hyrkan asked for the rights to the footage, Pelato would have handed it over. &#xA0;It was a given. &#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Yet Hyrkan was willing to just give him the rights?</p><p dir="ltr">&#x201C;Really? I can put the footage of this Raid on my page.&#x201D;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&#x201C;Of course. &#xA0;However, it isn&apos;t for free.&#x201D;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&#x201C;What do you want?&#x201D;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&#x201C;You made a wise decision.&#x201D;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Hyrkan answered in a vague manner. &#xA0;However, Pelato was able to see through to the meaning behind Hyrkan&apos;s words.</p><p dir="ltr">&#x201C;Of course. From this day forward, I won&apos;t participate in any ventures that would cause you harm. &#xA0;I promise on my character.&#x201D;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">It seemed Hyrkan was satisfied with the answer. &#xA0;He nodded his head. &#xA0;Pelato also had a satisfied smile as he looked at Hyrkan.</p><p dir="ltr">&#x201C;Ah.&#x201D;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">At that moment, it seemed Hyrkan had remembered something. &#xA0;He immediately handed over a note to Pelato.</p><p dir="ltr">&#x201C;This is the list of candies I had to eat, because of the magic thrown by your magician. &#xA0;It is quite a lot.&#x201D;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Pelato&apos;s face stiffened when he received the note. &#xA0;The consumable items listed were very expensive. &#xA0;These consumable items had great effect, and not even members of the raid teams of large guilds used it readily.</p><p dir="ltr">&#x201C;Of course, you should be willing to shoulder the burden. &#xA0;Right?&#x201D;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Pelato put on an awkward smile.</p><p dir="ltr">This was how the Corrupted Gray Cockatrice Raid came to an end.</p><p dir="ltr">4.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&#x2018;You son of a bitch, Apollo. &#xA0;If you aren&apos;t going to use the knife yourself, then you should just fuck off. &#xA0;Why are you causing me so much trouble?&#x2019;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">The man was skin and bones. He had sunken eyes, and there were dark circles under them.</p><p dir="ltr">His entire body screamed out the fact that he was someone addicted to a game. &#xA0;The item essential to a game addict, caffeine, was in front of Ahn-jaehyun. &#xA0;He was drowned within his thoughts.</p><p dir="ltr">&#x2018;Apollo is greedy, and he is an ill-tempered pig. &#xA0;Still, he isn&apos;t dumb enough to put in this much effort and capital to catch me.&#x2019;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">This thoughts centered around Apollo.</p><p dir="ltr">Before he returned to the past, he had been deeply involved with Apollo. &#xA0;At the time, Apollo had frothed at the mouth to catch Ahn-jaehyun, but he could understand the reasoning behind it.</p><p dir="ltr">However, that was before he returned to the past. &#xA0;Currently, he didn&apos;t have a good relationship with the Apollo guild, but he hadn&apos;t thought it was this bad.</p><p dir="ltr">It was true that Ahn-jaehyun had fucked over the guild members of the Apollo guild. &#xA0;However, it should have been minor damage from the perspective of Apollo.</p><p dir="ltr">Of course, if one considered Apollo&apos;s dirty personality, one could see why he was pursuing his revenge. &#xA0;Still, Apollo was spending a lot of money. &#xA0;It was money worth the annual salary of a new employee. &#xA0;Ahn-jaehyun couldn&apos;t understand it.</p><p dir="ltr">&#x2018;Still, where did that pig get all those decent Unique items?&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">What especially vexed Ahn-jaehyun was the part where the Apollo guild had loaned out the Unique Items.</p><p dir="ltr">At first, when he heard about Pelato loaning out the Unique items, he thought Golden Brother or an affiliated guild was loaning the items out.</p><p dir="ltr">Only a guild of that size had the capacity to do it.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&#x2018;He said Apollo guild had directly loaned those Items out. &#xA0;That&apos;s impossible.&#x2019;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">It basically meant Apollo guild wasn&apos;t at a level where they could pull this off.</p><p dir="ltr">Apollo guild wasn&apos;t small. &#xA0;They also had financial backing. &#xA0;If one looked at the users affiliated with the guild, their level were on the high side compared to the entire population of Warlord. &#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">However, they weren&apos;t a guild with enough in-game supply to be able to loan Items out to others.</p><p dir="ltr">In the end, it meant there was someone else that had loaned out the Items to the Apollo guild.</p><p dir="ltr">&#x2018;What a troublesome bastard.&#x2019;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Ahn-jaehyun stopped worrying at this point.</p><p dir="ltr">In truth, he couldn&apos;t find out what the Apollo guild had done unless he could capture and torture Apollo for answers.</p><p dir="ltr">Ahn-jaehyun could only do one thing. &#xA0;He could prepare.</p><p dir="ltr">&#x2018;The Big Smile bastards were also like this. &#xA0;I haven&apos;t done anything big yet, but they are already messing with me. &#xA0;Do I have honey rubbed all over my body?&#x2019;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Slowly, the larger guilds were trying to keep Ahn-jaehyun in check.</p><p dir="ltr">Ahn-jaehyun&apos;s goal was to fight them by himself.</p><p dir="ltr">&#x2018;All right. &#xA0;Just wait for me a little bit. &#xA0;Even if you guys don&apos;t want to, I&apos;ll fight you guys.&#x2019;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">However, it would be impossible for him to fight them right now. &#xA0;Until he could grow his strength, he needed forces that would help him.</p><p dir="ltr">He had won over Red Bulls and Pelato to his side. If it was the Golden Brothers, it was big enough that the Apollo guild wouldn&apos;t mess with them. &#xA0;Unexpectedly, Pelato might turn into a decent shield.</p><p dir="ltr">Of course, his main intention was to grow his strength.</p><p dir="ltr">Ahn-jaehyun thought about the Elf&apos;s keepsake.</p><p dir="ltr">There had been a map, and a note. He couldn&apos;t decipher the content. &#xA0;He probably had to visit Ahimbree, Chieftain Drah or Maeung to find out more about it.</p><p dir="ltr">However, he could guess at the identity of the map even if he couldn&apos;t verify it right now.</p><p dir="ltr">&#x2018;There is a great chance that this is a Dungeon Map.&#x2019;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">The map would lead him to something. &#xA0;Of course, he had no idea if this something was a monster or a treasure.</p><p dir="ltr">&#x201C;If something big appears this time.... If something like a Corrupted Destroyer&apos;s Necklace drops, I would go to the streets of Myeongdong, and dance in my underwear. Will this lead to something big?&#x201D; &#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">The only thing he wished for was a treasure.</p><p></p><p></p></div><p></p>
