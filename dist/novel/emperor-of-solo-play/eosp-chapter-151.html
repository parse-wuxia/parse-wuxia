<p><span style="">Chapter 151 - Death Knight (1)</span></p><p>1.</p><p><span style="">Everyone was waiting for this movie. &#xA0;The release date hadn&apos;t been set, yet it was suddenly out on the market. &#xA0;It was analogous to a person receiving a present from one&apos;s significant other at &#xA0;one&apos;s surprise party.</span></p><p><span style="">This was the kinds of feeling evoked when the Hahoe Mask&apos;s paid film called &apos;The Frozen Kingdom&apos; was released.</span></p><p><span style="">The film was unprecedented in many aspects.</span></p><p><span style="">The fact that it had a running time of 153 minutes was shocking in itself.</span></p><p><span style="">Moreover, it wasn&apos;t just footages of several monster fights, and the Boss Monster Raid. &#xA0;There was a single overarching plotline from start to finish. &#xA0;It was edited like a movie, and it attempted things that had never been tried before in the market of Warlord. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">It was unprecedented.</span></p><p><span style="">It was also priced at 9 dollars. &#xA0;Normal paid videos sold for an average of 1.6 dollar. &#xA0;It was an unprecedented price where it was almost 6 times the average price.</span></p><p><span style="">The most unprecedented part was the fact that the video had sold a million copies on the day of its release.</span></p><p><span style="">It was a string of unprecedented results, and eventually, it drew out a public response that was worthy of such unprecedented events.</span></p><p><span style="">- Wow! </span></p><p><span style="">- I can&apos;t believe footage from Warlord could be use to make such a video. </span></p><p><span style="">- This isn&apos;t a simple video. &#xA0;It&apos;s a movie! &#xA0;&#xA0;A movie!</span></p><p><span style="">- How much would a movie of this scale cost using CG in Hollywood?</span></p><p><span style="">- This movie could be shown at the theaters.</span></p><p><span style="">- It is better than most movies that are coming out right now.</span></p><p><span style="">The praise from the audiences had started in earnest.</span></p><p><span style="">[Frozen Kingdom. &#xA0;It is a making of an art piece instead of a product.] </span></p><p><span style="">[Hahoe Mask. &#xA0;His competition next year isn&apos;t the 30 great guilds. &#xA0;Instead, it&apos;ll be against other Oscar nominees.] </span></p><p><span style="">[For those who dream about being in a movie in the future, this film is like a bible to follow.] </span></p><p><span style="">Of course, the press was also full of praise.</span></p><p><span style="">The world was sending praise towards the Hahoe Mask, and the interest didn&apos;t end just there.</span></p><p><span style="">A rush of love calls started.</span></p><p><span style="">[Various media companies has sent love calls to the Hahoe Mask of &apos;The Frozen Kingdom&apos;!] </span></p><p><span style="">[It is quickly being considered for an Oscar. &#xA0;Will this open the door to the era of Virtual Reality?] </span></p><p><span style="">Hahoe Mask&apos;s movie was submitted into famous movie festivals, and a community within the movie industry argued for the formation of a new category. &#xA0;Some officials within the movie festivals argued for a VR movie award. &#xA0;Then there were the movie production companies and distributing agencies in Hollywood, who boasted a long and storied heritage, that wanted to distribute Hahoe Mask&apos;s movie. &#xA0;A variety of offers to sponsor and work with the Hahoe Mask was made.</span></p><p><span style="">Hahoe Mask&apos;s unprecedented movie had simply moved past the world called Warlord, and it was influencing various field of business in the real world.</span></p><p><span style="">Of course, the unprecedented move was a shock to some people. &#xA0;The Hahoe Mask&apos;s biggest rivals were the 30 great guilds, and they were so shocked that it made everything in front of their eyes turn white.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;This doesn&apos;t make any sense.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">Chev watched the 153 minute movie in a subdued manner. &#xA0;He was agonizing over his thoughts instead of marveling at the movie.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;No matter how I think about it, this doesn&apos;t make any sense.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">At first, he was in awe. &#xA0;He hadn&apos;t been mesmerized by the Hahoe Mask&apos;s excellent battle skill. &#xA0;There was a story here. &#xA0;It wasn&apos;t just a hunt. &#xA0;There was a reason behind why he caught the monsters, and the Hahoe Mask&#x2019;s actions all foreshadowed the battle with the Frost Knight. &#xA0;The storyline culminated like a flower blooming at the Frost Knight.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;How did he think of such.... &#xA0;No, this isn&apos;t just about coming up with an idea to do this. &#xA0;How was he able to attempt it in such a manner? &#xA0;How did he know his Quest would progress like that?&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">The Hahoe Mask was an adversary of the 30 great guilds. &#xA0;He hadn&#x2019;t hesitated in declaring a guild war on the Big Smile guild, but no one had taken it too seriously. &#xA0;The Hahoe Mask never backed down against the 30 great guilds.</span></p><p><span style="">The Hahoe Mask boasted the ability to produce high quality paid videoes, and he was bringing in a significant amount of income. &#xA0;However, the 30 great guilds had the live channels. &#xA0;Basically, they were in a different market from what the Hahoe Mask did.</span></p><p><span style="">The Hahoe Mask always showed surprising result, but it had always been within expected standards.</span></p><p><span style="">However, this time the Hahoe Mask had exceeded the standard. &#xA0;Chev had thought the 30 great guilds were running next to the Hahoe Mask as competitors. &#xA0;Chev had thought the Hahoe Mask was just slightly in front of them in the race. &#xA0;However, it seemed the Hahoe Mask had been running to launch himself into the air for flight.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Shit.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">The Hahoe Mask was an irregularity, and he always messed up the status quo. &#xA0;Now the 30 great guilds would have to react to the new standard set by the Hahoe Mask.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Do we have to follow after the Hahoe Mask&apos;s footsteps? &#xA0;Or should we battle him with some other exclusive contents? &#xA0;Will we have to go out and scout movie professionals? &#xA0;How much of our budget would we have to allocate in such a venture? &#xA0;How long will it take for the project to deliver results? &#xA0;In Warlord, it is critical to swiftly put out new contents. &#xA0;Will we be able to make a movie in such a short amount of time?&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">Chev was bombarded with worry upon worry.</span></p><p><span style="">Moreover, at the same time, all the officers of the 30 great guilds were going through a similar thought process as Chev.</span></p><p><span style="">Of course, the first one to come up with an answer was the Stormhunters guild.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I don&apos;t care how much we spend. &#xA0;There is a subsidiary company that received investment from us. &#xA0;I want you to recruit movie professionals from that company.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;After gathering the individuals, I want them to immediately using the footages we have as the groundwork. &#xA0;I want them to start producing short movies that lasts around 30 minutes.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I want to you to make sure that we have a new movie ready to be broadcasted every Friday at 9 PM. &#xA0;We have to have our first airing next Friday no matter what.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;If there is a problem in production, I don&apos;t want you to dick around. &#xA0;I want you to contact me directly.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Moreover, I want you to contact the Hahoe Mask through his Youtube page. &#xA0;Tell him our side wants to be in charge of distributing his movie. &#xA0;Tell him we will give him the full treatment.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What? &#xA0;Wouldn&apos;t he just ignore it?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Just do it.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes&#x2026;&#x2026;.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Che-sulyun couldn&apos;t even finish the Hahoe Mask&apos;s video. She moved immediately after 10 minutes into the movie.</span></p><p><span style="">She spoke to the members of the Stormhunters guild.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Every member that is above level 180 will cross the Urugal mountain range.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">- What? &#xA0;If it is above level 180, we have around 300 members. &#xA0;You want all of them to cross the Urugal great mountain range?</span></p><p><span style="">The current power structure was crumbling right now, and if they wanted to survive, it was important for them to be aggressive. &#xA0;As a guild master of a 30 great guild, she knew this better than anyone.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Is there a problem?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">- If I say there&apos;s a problem, what will happen to me?</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I&apos;ll can you.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">- After much thought, I have no problems with the plan.</span></p><p><span style="">She had the power to cause change in the Stormhunters with a single word.</span></p><p><span style="">Then there were those that didn&apos;t merely react to the unprecedented event. &#xA0;There were those that insisted on resisting against it.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;It is war now.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">When Sinclair saw the Hahoe Mask&apos;s video, he knew they couldn&apos;t coexist in Warlord. &#xA0;This hunch became reality in an instant.</span></p><p><span style="">[We have to eliminate the Hahoe Mask. &#xA0;He is our top priority. &#xA0;If you find his tracks, use every method and scheme to eliminate him.] </span></p><p><span style="">A new era truly dawned on Warlord.</span></p><p>2.</p><p><span style="">Black Hound.</span></p><p><span style="">It was similar to the one that appeared at the entrance to the Urugual mountain range. &#xA0;It was one of the most difficult mid-sized monster amongst similar level monsters. &#xA0;It was especially problematic that it was programmed to attack the Priests first. &#xA0;This was why it had the nickname of Priest Hunter, and it caused a lot of headache for the Users.</span></p><p><span style="">However, in an online game world, nothing was superior to level!</span></p><p><span style="">Kuh-hung, kuh-hung! </span></p><p><span style="">It was the same for the Black Hound. &#xA0;It could only let out a pitiful cry in front of the level difference. &#xA0;It was merely a pathetic dog.</span></p><p><span style="">Kuh-hung! </span></p><p><span style="">Its front right leg and left hind leg were severed. &#xA0;Its entire body was covered in wounds, and a large amount of ice was forming on the wound. &#xA0;The Black Hound was beyond looking pitiful. &#xA0;It looked to be in a brutal state.</span></p><p><span style="">The more devastating fact was that the enemy that had put it in such a state was still in front of the Black Hound.</span></p><p><span style="">It was a Knight instead of a Skeleton Warrior.</span></p><p><span style="">Moreover, it wasn&apos;t just a simple Skeleton Knight. &#xA0;It was equipped with the Great Battle Hero&apos;s Sword, which was one of the strongest weapons in Warlord. &#xA0;It also wore a level 190 Unique defensive set called Blood Ogre set. &#xA0;At its peak value, this set was sold for 20 thousand gold. &#xA0;The Skeleton Knight was equipped with such strong Items.</span></p><p><span style="">Moreover, it was letting out a bluish cold energy thanks to the Ancient Power of Frost. &#xA0;Then there was the passive ability of the Blood Ogre set that decreased the enemy&apos;s Stats by 15%.</span></p><p><span style="">The Skeleton Knight taking down the Black Hound was akin to killing a chicken with an electric saw.</span></p><p><span style="">No human in this world would use an electric saw to slaughter a chicken.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;I made a very firm pledge that I&apos;ll hunt down every single of you bastards.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">It was retribution.</span></p><p><span style="">In the distant past, he had travelled the Urugal mountain range to visit the Blacksmith Olf. &#xA0;He had been humiliated by the Black Hound during this trip. &#xA0;At the time, his heart was filled with frustration and a desire for revenge. &#xA0;Hyrkan was burning away this desire at that moment.</span></p><p><span style="">Of course, he wasn&apos;t at the Urugal mountain range just to fulfill his pledge.</span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan raised his head to look at the summit that was veiled by fog. &#xA0;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;I can&apos;t believe it took me over two weeks to get here.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">A lot of things had happened as he was coming here. &#xA0;It wasn&apos;t just the volume. &#xA0;It was also the magnitude the events.</span></p><p><span style="">The production process of the Frozen Kingdom he released yesterday hadn&apos;t been easy. &#xA0;He had to put it out as fast as possible. &#xA0;When he tried to accelerate the production process, naturally the cost skyrocketed. &#xA0;He invested almost twice the production cost he had initially estimated. &#xA0;The cost was being discussed in terms of hundred thousand dollars.</span></p><p><span style="">Aside from his movie, Hyrkan had a lot of things to do. &#xA0;He had to sell the Items he had earned in the Frozen Kingdom, and he also had to sell the Items that weren&apos;t needed by his Skeleton underlings. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">Then he had to purchase new Items. &#xA0;All the Items he purchased weren&apos;t cheap, and a significant amount of money were exchanged in the deals. &#xA0;He had to focus on the details of deal.</span></p><p><span style="">In the real world, he was busy meeting his lawyer, accountant and solicitors. &#xA0;He had to take numerous consultations and measures in regards to his taxes. &#xA0;He had been lax with his taxes, since he was busy with the game. &#xA0;However, the amount of money he was earning and spending was too large now.</span></p><p><span style="">Then there was that one incident when he purchased the 6S Model V-Gear. &#xA0;He paid an enormous amount of money to buy it, but there was a problem during the test phase. &#xA0;There was a range of preexistent setting, but none of them was suitable for Hyrkan. &#xA0;He was non-standard, so they had to program a new setting for him.</span></p><p><span style="">While this was all going on, he continued on the 2nd Advancement Quest. &#xA0;The 2nd Advancement Quest wasn&apos;t easy. &#xA0;It was annoying in the fact that he had to travel all over to meet the NPCs scattered all around the large continent. &#xA0;The ingredients from the monsters were scattered too. &#xA0;It was almost as if he was making pilgrimages to various locations in Warlord.</span></p><p><span style="">Of course, he had to focus on leveling up as he was doing all of this. &#xA0;There were a lot of Users that picked a fight with him, and he had to deal with all of them. &#xA0;He also got into a small war with a guild with a significant number of members. &#xA0;He was targeted more than any other User in Warlord. &#xA0;He was worth as much as a Boss Monster, so everyone in Warlord was his enemy now.</span></p><p><span style="">It was a mouthful to explain everything. &#xA0;He had to digest his busy schedule, and the fact that he was here was a miracle in itself.</span></p><p><span style="">It had taken him a long time to come here.</span></p><p><span style="">On the other hand, the fact that it took him a long time meant that he was finished with his preparation. &#xA0;He had organized everything around him, so he could focus on his game for awhile.</span></p><p><span style="">The Frozen Kingdom movie wasn&apos;t just something that had made a lot of money. &#xA0;It was an iconic piece that had a huge effect on Warlord and the VR market. &#xA0;Hyrkan had taken the nickname of Rich Lich from Subrata Duta. &#xA0;Unlike the original Rich Lich, he didn&apos;t have 5 million dollars to wield as a weapon. &#xA0;However, he was now able to buy most Item sets he wanted in a lump sum payment.</span></p><p><span style="">He had finished his 2nd Advancement. &#xA0;His Class as Necromancer had advanced to Lich, and he had gained the new Skills he had been waiting for.</span></p><p><span style="">He also bought the expensive consumable Items. &#xA0;Instead of looking at the price, he bought the most effective consumables.</span></p><p><span style="">Above all, he had finished solidifying his resolve.</span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan no longer stared at the summit of the Urugal mountain range. &#xA0;He looked beyond it.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Let&apos;s do this.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">It didn&apos;t matter what was across the Urugal mountain range. &#xA0;From now on, the obstacles won&apos;t be things he already knew about. &#xA0;New and surprising contents would unfold in front of him!</span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan didn&apos;t plan on being taken aback by it. &#xA0;He had no thoughts of hesitating or backing down from the new challenge.</span></p><p><span style="">Even if he was broken into pieces from encountering a wall, he planned on running into it with full force.</span></p><p><span style="">Currently, his opponent was the Urugal mountain range, and he was at the midway point. &#xA0;He met the gatekeeper that guarded the waist of the mountain. &#xA0;It was the Skull Collector.</span></p><p>3.</p><p><span style="">If the Hahoe Mask had opened the era of the Northland exploration, the Stormhunters guild opened the era of climbing the Urugal mountain range.</span></p><p><span style="">It was hard to open the door to both these locations. &#xA0;If one hadn&apos;t made thorough preparation for these two places, these locations were ruthless in separating the users. &#xA0;It quickly and ruthlessly sorted out the prepared and the unprepared.</span></p><p><span style="">If one wanted to reach the Frozen Kingdom from the Northland, one had to cross the frozen land. &#xA0;This stretch of land judged the Users. &#xA0;In the Urugal mountain range, the foggy mid-slope of the mountain held a single tunnel that all Users had to pass. &#xA0;There was a judge dispatched at this location to sort out the Users. &#xA0;It was the Skull Collector &apos;Voodook&apos;.</span></p><p><span style="">Voodook was an expression used by the Elven race of Warlord. &#xA0;The word signified a warrior that used the Vodoo arts. &#xA0;At the end of the Voodook&apos;s tunnel, there was a middle boss monster named the Skull Collector.</span></p><p><span style="">It was level 200! </span></p><p><span style="">There were various skull of monsters hung around its neck, and it used the skulls to summon guardians that would defend the path. &#xA0;Alongside the summons, it used Voodoo skill on its enemies. &#xA0;It was a snake-headed giant that boasted enormous power.</span></p><p><span style="">Even if one gave this explanation, most Users wouldn&apos;t be able to understand the overwhelming presence of this monster.</span></p><p><span style="">The monster was very strong, and it was very troublesome to face. &#xA0;Moreover, the guardians under the control of the Skull Collector was frightening. &#xA0;In terms of its offensive capability, it was currently one of the top monsters in Warlord. &#xA0;It was something that couldn&apos;t be described unless one had faced it.</span></p><p><span style="">This was why a simple explanation was devised to describe the Skull Collector.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hahoe Mask-like bastard.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;How will we catch that Hahoe Mask-like bastard?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ah. &#xA0;That Hahoe Mask-like bastard is driving me nuts.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Hahoe Mask-like Bastard.</span></p><p><span style="">Currently, this was the Skull Collector&apos;s nickname. &#xA0;It had strong offensive capability like the Hahoe Mask, and it commanded summoned familiars like the Hahoe Mask. &#xA0;Moreover, this monster was aggressive in participating in battle to show off its powerful offensive capability like the Hahoe Mask. &#xA0;This was why this nickname was attributed to this monster.</span></p><p><span style="">On top of it all, there were other factors that made this monster troublesome.</span></p><p><span style="">It was a monster that appeared in an Instant Dungeon, and an Instant Dungeon only allowed 7 members to enter. &#xA0;Moreover, once a party enters, one needed to wait 7 minutes before the next group can go in. It was a Dungeon that had a significant wait time.</span></p><p><span style="">It was an instant Dungeon, and there weren&#x2019;t any towns or castles near the Urugal mountain range. &#xA0;When one suffered a Game Over, one had to start over at a faraway location. &#xA0;This was why many considered it to be annoying.</span></p><p><span style="">It was called the alleyway to meet the Skull Collector, and there were a lot of challengers lining in front of the Voodook&#x2019;s tunnel.</span></p><p><span style="">He appeared at this location.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;The Mercy guild failed? &#xA0;This isn&apos;t something to take lightly. &#xA0;I don&#x2019;t think any more clear methods will be released.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hey, &#xA0;Hey.&#x201D; &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;How many days have we wasted here because of the Hahoe Mask-like bastard? &#xA0;This is driving me nuts.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hey!&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Be quiet.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I said shut up.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What are you trying to say?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;The Hahoe Mask is here!&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;That&apos;s right. &#xA0;The Hahoe Mask-like bastard is.... Huhk!&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Hahoe Mask Hyrkan had appeared at the entrance of the Voodook&#x2019;s tunnel.</span></p>
