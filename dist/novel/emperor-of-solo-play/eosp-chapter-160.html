<p>Chapter 160 &#x2013; Catch it or Be Caught (3)</p><p>7.</p><p><span style="">When Anugas appeared and it opened its eye, Hyrkan equipped the Circlet of Purification. &#xA0;However, it didn&apos;t work. &#xA0;Hyrkan, who had been looking at Anugas, shook his head from side to side.</span></p><p><span style="">The simulation in Hyrkan&apos;s head came to an end.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;I&apos;m pretty sure I remember the Red Bulls saying that the Circlet of Purification didn&apos;t work against Anugas.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan started the simulation again.</span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan once again appeared in front of Anugas. &#xA0;When it opened its eye, it nullified all magic, magical recovery and the effect of magic recovery Items. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan faced Anugas equipped with the Dark Spot set and the Deposed Prince&apos;s Sword. &#xA0;It was the best setting for a Striker in Warlord. </span></p><p><span style="">Hweek hweek.</span></p><p><span style="">Anugas&apos; four arms came at Hyrkan like snakes, and he kept dodging them. He was swift in his dodges. He swung the Deposed Prince&apos;s Sword, and it scraped Anugas&apos; body. A deep wound was made each time.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Its leather has considerable defensive capabilities. &#xA0;It might be better to use the Crying sword instead of the Deposed Prince&apos;s Sword.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan&apos;s sword suddenly changed from the Deposed Prince&apos;s Sword to the Crying Sword inside Hyrkan&apos;s simulation,.</span></p><p><span style="">Choo-roong choo-roong!</span></p><p><span style="">An additional sound was added in. &#xA0;The frozen battle started up once again.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Hmmmm.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">At a certain point, Hyrkan frowned. &#xA0;He had been earnestly fighting when Hyrkan&apos;s left arm was caught by Anugas&apos; arm. &#xA0;He frowned as he watched Anugas lift him into the air.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;If I continue to do a close combat, I&apos;ll eventually be caught..&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan stopped the gruesome simulation. &#xA0;He didn&apos;t need to think along this thread anymore. &#xA0;He once again reminded the simulation back to the first scene.</span></p><p><span style="">He started the same battle again. &#xA0;However, Hyrkan had changed his Item setting. &#xA0;He also changed his battle style. &#xA0;Instead of a straight close combat, he started a hit &amp; run style battle.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Mmmmm.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">They looked like knights on horses with their spears raised. &#xA0;They ran at each other. &#xA0;It was like a jousting match. &#xA0;At the brief moment of contact, they glanced by each other as they gave each other small wounds. &#xA0;The battle continued for a long time without anything bad happening.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Ughhh.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">However, at a certain point, uninvited guests dropped in on the battle. &#xA0;A massive magical bombardment started falling towards Anugas and Hyrkan. &#xA0;The AOE magic covered the battle, and in the end, he lost.</span></p><p><span style="">At the same time, someone&apos;s voice tickled Hyrkan&apos;s ears.</span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan. &#xA0;Do you know the watchman style?</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Shit.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan once again ended the simulation.</span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan didn&apos;t attempt the simulation again. &#xA0;Instead, he looked at the ruins of the Heard Fortress. &#xA0;He moved his gaze to the side, and he looked towards the thick forest surrounding the Heard Fortress. &#xA0;The cries of monsters were exploding out from the forest. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">The actual sound that had tickled Hyrkan&apos;s ears was the sound of a battle between monsters and a group of Users.</span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan frowned.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;In the end, the problem is the Pasta bastards.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">Pasta. </span></p><p><span style="">Of course, Hyrkan wasn&apos;t talking about spaghetti.</span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan called them Pasta instead of Five Stars.</span></p><p><span style="">Currently, it was a nickname given to the five guilds trying to monopolize the Black Continent.</span></p><p><span style="">Of course, the nickname Pasta didn&apos;t have a good meaning behind it. &#xA0;Many Users were dissatisfied with the activities of these five guilds, and they were the subject of derision by the Users. &#xA0;When the awesome nickname of Five Stars was given to these five guilds, some wise-ass User decided to call them Pasta. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">However, this didn&apos;t mean the capability of the Five Stars was a joke.</span></p><p><span style="">The Five Stars wanted to make the Black Continent their own stage. &#xA0;To carry out this monopoly, they showed that they were very thorough in their preparations and planning.</span></p><p><span style="">One of this plan was to monitor the ruins of the Heard Fortress.</span></p><p><span style="">The Five Stars experienced a bitter lesson from Anugas, who was the Boss Monster of the Heard Fortress. &#xA0;Unless the Five Stars were idiots, it would be natural for them to pay careful attention to Anguas.</span></p><p><span style="">In other words, the Five Stars would know in short time when Hyrkan attempted the Anugas Raid. &#xA0;At the very least, the Five Stars were prepared to mobilize if such an event did occur.</span></p><p><span style="">This was another obvious point, but no one would help Hyrkan in the Anugas Raid.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Fuck.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Rough swear words came out of Hyrkan&apos;s mouth. &#xA0;In the end, the situation forced Hykan to make a choice.</span></p><p><span style="">Basically, Hyrkan had to choose to share.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;A day like this has finally come.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">Of course, Hyrkan would bear the full responsibility that came with his choice. &#xA0;This was why he was letting out the rough cuss words.</span></p><p>8.</p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What do you think?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;You look pretty.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I don&apos;t care if I look pretty. &#xA0;That doesn&apos;t mean anything. &#xA0;Just tell me what kind of vibe I&#x2019;m &#xA0;giving off.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;In truth, a man usually doesn&apos;t look too deeply. He&apos;ll just think you are pretty, and he won&apos;t care what vibe you give off.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;How about you, Hahui? &#xA0;What do you think?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">At that moment, a loud sound erupted from next to Hatch.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Queen is the best!&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Hatch furrowed his brows at the sound. &#xA0;Hahui had yelled out without any thought, and Hahui&apos;s voice had almost burst Hatch&apos;s eardrums. &#xA0;Hahui had yelled with all her might from right next to him. &#xA0;Of course, his expression wasn&apos;t good when he heard such a sound.</span></p><p><span style="">Hatch continued to frown as he looked at the beautiful woman, who unfurled her hair. &#xA0;He looked at Shir.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;It isn&apos;t as if she is going out to meet a prospective marriage partner... Jeez.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">He reflexively tried to laugh out loud. &#xA0;However, Hatch immediately forced down the laughter. &#xA0;He knew he shouldn&apos;t laugh in this situation. </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Queen.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Speak.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I want to be clear about this. &#xA0;It is ok to show good intentions towards him, but please don&apos;t do anything that&apos;ll cause a loss to our guild. If you do act in such a way, I really am going to leave this guild.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">This was the feeling he had as a loyal subject. &#xA0;He had spoken his advice towards the tyrant. &#xA0;His emotions was writ large on his face. </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;How laughable. Your contract runs until 2050.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Shut the hell up, 2051.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Hahui&apos;s verbal tackle changed his serious expression into an annoyed expression. &#xA0;His terms of contract was Hatch&apos;s achilles heel.</span></p><p><span style="">Shir spoke calmly as she looked at the two.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I want everyone to be on standby.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">She was calm and forthright. &#xA0;After ending her words, she turned her back on the Users that were looking at her. &#xA0;Thirty Stormhunters guild members were standing not too far away from Hatch and Hahui.</span></p><p><span style="">They were nervous as they looked at the back of their leader.</span></p><p><span style="">The source of their nervousness....</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;I never expected the Hahoe Mask to approach us first.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">It was the Hahoe Mask.</span></p><p><span style="">The contact had come so suddenly. &#xA0;This was the first time the Hahoe Mask had contacted the Stormhunters guild.</span></p><p><span style="">From the Hahoe Mask&apos;s perspective, it should have been easy to contact them. &#xA0;The Stormhunters guild had sent so many love calls that the Hahoe Mask was probably tired and annoyed at receiving them. &#xA0;There had been many opportunities for him to return the love call.</span></p><p><span style="">This was the first time the Hahoe Mask had answered their ardent love call.</span></p><p><span style="">Of course, this didn&apos;t mean the Hahoe Mask was committed to joining the Stormhunters guild. &#xA0;The purpose of this meeting was to make a deal. &#xA0;Hahoe Mask didn&apos;t tell them the content of the deal. &#xA0;The only thing he promised was a meeting where they&apos;ll talk.</span></p><p><span style="">Of course, he asked Shir to come by herself, and Shir had readily accepted the proposal.</span></p><p><span style="">Basically, the Storm Queen would have a one on one talk with the Hahoe Mask.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;If this goes sideways, our dealing will get endlessly tangled up. &#xA0;If it works out, everything will keep getting untangled.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">At that moment, Hatch was worried about two things.</span></p><p><span style="">First, he worried the Hahoe Mask might attack the Storm Queen. &#xA0;He could guarantee it. &#xA0;The Storm Queen couldn&apos;t win against the Hahoe Mask in a 1on1 battle.</span></p><p><span style="">The other worry was the fact that the Storm Queen had something akin to a crush on the Hahoe Mask. &#xA0;He worried she would agree to a bad proposal, because she was influenced by her emotions.</span></p><p><span style="">He was actually worried more about the latter situation.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;She&apos;s weirdly weak in front of the Hahoe Mask.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">The Storm Queen was interested in the Hahoe Mask, and her affections may be considered to be a crush. &#xA0;No, it might be something more. &#xA0;However, the Storm Queen&apos;s personality didn&apos;t allow her to send a love letter with her ardent feeling in it. She had a twisted personality that she destroyed whatever she couldn&apos;t have.</span></p><p><span style="">Of course, her twisted affection wouldn&apos;t help in a rational deal.</span></p><p><span style="">The problem with this situation was the stage . &#xA0;The Black Continent was a very harsh land that even the Stormhunters guild was struggling against.</span></p><p><span style="">In such a harsh land, the Hahoe Mask had approached the Stormhunters guild. &#xA0;At the very least, he wouldn&apos;t be approaching them with peaceful intentions.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Please let it not be about fighting Anugas together. &#xA0;We have to avoid doing a Raid against a monster that had suddenly appeared.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">Hatch prayed once again.</span></p><p><span style="">The conversation between the two started as the prayer ended.</span></p><p>9.</p><p><span style="">Storm Queen and the Hahoe Mask.</span></p><p><span style="">They were the most skilled Users representing Warlord. &#xA0;The worth of the Storm Queen&apos;s name by itself was less than the Hahoe Mask, but everyone agreed that these two were the top 2 skilled Users in Warlord. &#xA0;Everyone considered it to be fact.</span></p><p><span style="">Their sex didn&apos;t have to do anything with their rankings. &#xA0;In many ways, these two were unprecedented in their accomplishments. &#xA0;Each of them were making their own unparalleled storyline in Warlord&#x2019;s history. &#xA0;The two of them were treated almost as equals. &#xA0;They were seen as being of equal rank. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">Unless the Storm Queen and the Hahoe Mask fought for supremacy, this perception wouldn&apos;t change.</span></p><p><span style="">Moreover, there was the Immoral Prince raid footage. &#xA0;They had fought together for the first time, yet they were completely in sync. &#xA0;Of course, it held the distinction of being the most clicked video in regards to Warlord.</span></p><p><span style="">The two Users were facing each other.</span></p><p><span style="">This was a first for both of them. </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I want to thank you for that time.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">The Storm Queen was the first to speak, and she had thanked someone else. &#xA0;This was a first in many ways.</span></p><p><span style="">However, Hyrkan did show any reaction towards her gesture. &#xA0;The only thing that could be seen beneath the Hahoe Mask was his lips. &#xA0;He didn&apos;t smile or frown. &#xA0;His mouth just stayed the same.</span></p><p><span style="">After looking at Hyrkan, Shir spoke once again.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;If you don&apos;t want a long talk, let&apos;s get down to business.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">It wasn&apos;t an exaggeration to say that Shir had the shortest temper in Warlord. &#xA0;However, at that moment, Shir wasn&apos;t angry. &#xA0;Instead, she went out of her way to move the situation along.</span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan slowly opened his mouth as he looked at her.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I&apos;m going to do the Anugas Raid.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">He brought up the main subject of this meeting.</span></p><p><span style="">Shir had expected those words, so her answer came out immediately.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;So what? &#xA0;Are you asking for our help?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Will you help me if I ask for help?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I have to think on it.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Anugas. </span></p><p><span style="">The Stormhunters guild didn&apos;t have a lot of information regarding Anugas. &#xA0;The Five Stars held the most information, since they had fought Anugas. &#xA0;They had gained information through the not so insignificant sacrifices of their members.</span></p><p><span style="">Still, the rumors had spread. The Stormhunters guild had received the information that this Boss Monster had a ridiculous ability that prevented the Users from using their Skills.</span></p><p><span style="">This was why Hatch had spoken to her. &#xA0;If the Hahoe Mask suggested they do a Raid, he told her to turn down the Hahoe Mask no matter what. He told her to ignore all his requests unless the Hahoe Mask joins the Stormhunters guild.</span></p><p><span style="">In other words, they would willingly fight with the Hahoe Mask if he joins the Stormhunters guild.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Solo Play.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">However, Hahoe Mask crushed Shir&apos;s expectation with a single word.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I&apos;ll catch Anugas by myself.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Of course, Shir knew what Solo Play meant, yet the Hahoe Mask had spoken again. &#xA0;Moreover, Shir felt as if Hyrkan&apos;s words wasn&apos;t directed at her. &#xA0;It was directed toward some other unknown person.</span></p><p><span style="">Shir&apos;s expression turned to ice.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Then what do you want from us?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">In truth, Shir had wanted such a picture. &#xA0;She wanted a situation where the Hahoe Mask shared fate with the Stormhunters guild. &#xA0;It was a radical idea, yet she had wished for it. &#xA0;However, Hyrkan had stepped on her wish in a single breath. &#xA0;Of course, her expression would cool.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I want you to block the Five Stars from interfering with me.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Why should we do that?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;If I fail, the baton will be passed on to you.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Shir held herself back from complaining.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;So you want us to be the bridesmaid.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">It had been the same in the Argardo raid. &#xA0;They had to create a stage where Hyrkan would be able to focus on the Anugas raid. &#xA0;If he failed at the Anugas Raid, the Stormhunters guild would hold the rights to attempt the Raid next.</span></p><p><span style="">Moreover, after fighting a battle with Hyrkan, Anugas would be in tatters.</span></p><p><span style="">On the other hand, that was the only merit they&apos;ll gain from this. &#xA0;It would be hard to expect anything extra.</span></p><p><span style="">Above all, the Stormhunters guild would suffer significant damage if they got in the way of the Five Stars.</span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan used a card he prepared to convince the Stormhunters guild.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I would like you to do me this favor instead of the thanks you gave me.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">The thanks he had received was in regards to the Immoral Prince Raid. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">When she hear those words, all traces of emotion was erased from Shir&apos;s lips.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;All right. &#xA0;I can&apos;t stand being indebted to anyone.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">What kind of expression would Hatch make if he had heard this conversation?</span></p><p><span style="">However, Hatch wasn&apos;t present in this meeting. &#xA0;Moreover, their conversation wasn&apos;t being transmitted using Voice Talk.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I&apos;ll do it.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Shir gave a firm answer.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Then there will be no debt between us.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes. &#xA0;There will be no debt.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">In a flash, the debt that was between the two was gone. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">Shir was able to finally bring up the subject.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hahoe Mask. &#xA0;You should join the Stormhunters guild. &#xA0;We&apos;ll promise you the best treatment.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">When he heard her words, Hyrkan looked hard at her.</span></p><p><span style="">A thick silence had descended.</span></p><p><span style="">At the end of the silence, Hyrkan opened his mouth.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;In this game, the Stormhunters guild&apos;s symbol...&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Toohk toohk.</span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan tapped the left side of his chest with a finger.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I will never step onto a battlefield with the symbol placed there.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">His gesture reinforced his strong words. &#xA0;Shir&apos;s expression turned much colder at his extremely strong words.</span></p><p><span style="">It was as if a snowstorm was about to form around Shir.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What&apos;s the reason?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan turned his back to her instead of telling her his reasons.</span></p><p><span style="">While his back was turned to her, he spoke in a low voice. &#xA0;He spoke in such a small voice that the only one that was able to hear his words was Hyrkan.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;There is the accomplishments I&apos;ve achieved until now. &#xA0;I won&apos;t be able to do it, because I would be ashamed of myself.&#x201D;</span></p>
