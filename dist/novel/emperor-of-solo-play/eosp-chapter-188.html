<p>Chapter 188 &#x2013; Barbarian King (5)</p><p><span style="">14.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;We broke through!&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">- The path is open!</span></p><p><span style="">The battle began, and the confrontation opened up with the magical bombardment sent by the Magicians. &#xA0;Then the Tankers made a line to stop the monsters from reaching the Magicians. While both sides battled to whittle down the number of each side, eight teams started boring holes through the horde of monsters.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Drill through! &#xA0;Drill through!&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Strikers carry the Priests and Magicians in!&quot; </span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Hurry up and get in there!&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">A large amount of the force started to be sucked through the holes. &#xA0;Then the Users started to build another wall as they stood with their backs towards the Barbarian King. &#xA0;It looked as if they were protecting the Barbarian King.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;We are in place!&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">-After solidifying your position, I want the Healers to stick close to the Tankers!</span></p><p><span style="">-You guys take charge of columns that break away!</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;If the situation is desperate, the Magicians should use magic to regain the Aggro!&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">-This is for the Magician Team. &#xA0;Please hold back from using AOE magic. &#xA0;It has to be Target Magic. &#xA0;I will say this again. &#xA0;Please hold back from using AOE Magic. &#xA0;We have to make a ring. &#xA0;You guys have to fight the battle through Target Magic.</span></p><p><span style="">This was called the Donut Plan.</span></p><p><span style="">It was a plan devised to stop the monsters, who had come out to protect the Barbarian King, from returning to the Barbarian King. &#xA0;The Tankers would block off the route back. &#xA0;A wall had to be formed. &#xA0;The Barbarian King would be at the center. &#xA0;The Users and monsters would form a donut shape around it.</span></p><p><span style="">This was the crux of the plan.</span></p><p><span style="">- The Hahoe Mask is getting ready.</span></p><p><span style="">The empty hole in the middle of the donut would be the stage where the Hahoe Mask and the Barbarian King would fight.</span></p><p><span style="">The start was announced by the Bone Dragon.</span></p><p><span style="">The Bone Dragon flew high in the sky, and it was the first to attack the Barbarian King. &#xA0;It was 20 meters long, and the enormous Bone Dragon was terrifying.</span></p><p><span style="">It was made using a level 220 Dragon type boss monster, so it was well worth its cost. &#xA0;&#xA0;The Ingredients cost tens of thousand of gold.</span></p><p><span style="">The Bone Dragon landed in front of the Barbarian King, and the remaining monsters near the Barbarian King charged forward. &#xA0;All the large monsters stuck to the enormous body of the Bone Dragon.</span></p><p><span style="">After several seconds&#x2026;.</span></p><p><span style="">Kwah-gwah-gwah-gwahng!</span></p><p><span style="">There was thousand Bone Explosives planted inside the Dragon&#x2019;s body, and in a flash, all the monster sticking near the Bone Dragon was swept up in the explosion.</span></p><p><span style="">This was the signal.</span></p><p><span style="">- The Hahoe Mask is on the move!</span></p><p><span style="">When the signal was given, Hahoe Mask started running. &#xA0;He started to run towards the wall that was paved with the lives of Users. &#xA0;The Skeleton Warriors was close behind Hyrkan.</span></p><p><span style="">In a flash, the group jumped over the wall made by the Users.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Oh oh oh!&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;It&#x2019;s the Hahoe Mask! &#xA0;Hahoe Mask-nim looked at me!&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;He didn&#x2019;t look at you. &#xA0;He looked at the monster in front of you!&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;You are the only one we trust, Hahoe Mask! &#xA0;Please kill the Barbarian King!&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Hahoe Mask and the Skeletons flew over their heads like sparrows in flight. &#xA0;The Tankers, Priests, Strikers and Magicians gave him words of encouragement.</span></p><p><span style="">Hahoe Mask left the cheering Users behind as he ran towards the Barbarian King. &#xA0;The number of monsters charging towards the Hahoe Mask was few in number.</span></p><p><span style="">The Bone Dragon had been used as bait, and its suicide bombing had taken out most of the &#xA0;miscellaneous monsters.</span></p><p><span style="">The Skeleton Warriors were in charge of taking care of the leftover monsters. &#xA0;While Hyrkan reduced his speed, the Skeleton Warriors charged past Hyrkan to kill the monsters.</span></p><p><span style="">Several Skeletons unhesitatingly charged towards their master&#x2019;s biggest enemy. &#xA0;&#xA0;They fearlessly charged towards the Barbarian King.</span></p><p><span style="">The Barbarian King had done nothing up until now, but it moved in reaction to the Skeletons.</span></p><p><span style="">Hoo-ooh-oong!</span></p><p><span style="">The long nose of the Barbarian King was swung like a whip. &#xA0;In just a single swing, two Skeleton Warriors approaching the Barbarian King was broken into pieces. &#xA0;However, one was able to dodge, and it approached the feet of the Barbarian King. &#xA0;The Skeleton Warrior stabbed the Gem embedded in the Barbarian King&#x2019;s armor.</span></p><p><span style="">It was able to hit the Gem only once.</span></p><p><span style="">After the Skeleton Warrior finished its single attack, it was immediately grabbed by the Barbarian King&#x2019;s hand.</span></p><p><span style="">Kwah-jeek, kwah-jeek!</span></p><p><span style="">The Skeleton had been equipped with the Bone Armor and the Tattoo Scorpion set. &#xA0;However, it was crushed in an instant.</span></p><p><span style=""> The Skeleton Warriors were impregnable against most monsters here, yet they were easily broken. &#xA0;They were like toys in the hands of the Barbarian King.</span></p><p><span style="">The Skeleton Warriors exploded as they let out the poison of the Tattoo Scorpion, yet it had no effect on the Barbarian King.</span></p><p><span style="">However&#x2026;.</span></p><p><span style="">Gwah-ahng!</span></p><p><span style="">The explosion, which had erupted in the Barbarian King&#x2019;s hand, was somewhat effective. The Barbarian King&#x2019;s hand was frozen. &#xA0;The Bone Explosive held the Transcendent Rank Ancient Power, Legendary Rank Ancient Power, Mythos Rank Ancient Power and the Power of Frost. &#xA0;It froze the Barbarian King for 3 seconds. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">The 3 seconds was a golden opportunity. &#xA0;&#xA0;Hyrkan threw his Bone Spear.</span></p><p><span style="">The Bone Spear flew towards the shoulder armor, and it embedded itself in a red-colored gem.</span></p><p><span style="">It was surprisingly accurate!</span></p><p><span style="">However, there was no time to marvel at Hyrkan&#x2019;s accuracy.</span></p><p><span style="">This was a fight against time.</span></p><p><span style="">The Users wouldn&#x2019;t be able to last too long against the monsters. &#xA0;Moreover, the Skeletons and other summonable familiars wouldn&#x2019;t be able to last long against the Barbarian King.</span></p><p><span style="">He had to destroy 31 Protection Gems in a short amount of time.</span></p><p><span style="">At the very least, the Protection Gem needed two hits to break it. &#xA0;This meant he needed to attack it 62 times to destroy all the Gems. &#xA0;If each attack took a minute, one had to spend an hour in destroying the Gems.</span></p><p><span style="">This was why Hyrkan stayed in place. &#xA0;He knew what he wanted to do. &#xA0;He&#x2019;ll let out an all-out attack on the Gems. &#xA0;In a flash, he would strike the Gems with his Bone Spears.</span></p><p><span style="">He was Hyrkan.</span></p><p><span style="">He was a genius.</span></p><p><span style="">On the stage of the virtual reality game, his skill and talent was unparalleled. &#xA0;He was an extraordinary genius, who defied all common sense.</span></p><p><span style="">If he was a Magician, Ballista would probably have to give up his nickname to Hyrkan.</span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan&#x2019;s spear flew in a tight arc. &#xA0;It was once again embedded in the armor&#x2019;s Gem.</span></p><p><span style="">Poo-hwaht!</span></p><p><span style="">[The first Protection Gem was destroyed.]</span></p><p><span style="">A Gem had been destroyed.</span></p><p><span style="">Boo-oh-oh!</span></p><p><span style="">At that moment, the Barbarian King let out a cry that could only be made by a beast with the nose of an elephant. &#xA0;The sound went on for a long time as if it was a boat horn.</span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan unconsciously spoke towards it.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Come at me! &#xA0;Let&apos;s end this!&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">15.</span></p><p><span style="">-He made his move.</span></p><p><span style="">On the fierce battlefield, the Strikers attempted Armor Breaking, while the Tankers held the monsters at bay. &#xA0;When the Armor Breaking was done, the Magicians sent their magical spells against these monsters. &#xA0;The Priests busily moved around to save as many lives as they could.</span></p><p><span style="">In such a battle, the members of the Hands guild had been calmly killing the monsters. &#xA0;The order came to the nine Users, who had hidden themselves amongst the crowd.</span></p><p><span style="">They had given a reasonable effort at killing the monsters.</span></p><p><span style="">They abandoned their spots.</span></p><p><span style="">They started walking. </span></p><p><span style="">They moved towards the ring being maintained by the Users, who were sacrificing their lives.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Hey!&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Someone called after them, but they acted as if they couldn&#x2019;t hear the person. &#xA0;They redoubled their efforts to reach the stage.</span></p><p><span style="">Of course, they couldn&#x2019;t do as they pleased. &#xA0;There were Users tasked with dealing with changing variables, and these Users blocked the paths of the Hands guild.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Hey. &#xA0;This place is off limits.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;At, that is......</span></p><p><span style="">The members of the Hands guild paused as they looked at the Users in front of them.</span></p><p><span style="">They weren&#x2019;t thinking about whether they should fight or not.</span></p><p><span style="">They were think of a way that&#x2019;ll allow them to kill the Users in front of them as soon as possible.</span></p><p><span style="">As they were pondering such thoughts, they looked closer at the opponents barring their way.</span></p><p><span style="">There was a flicker of recognition.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Red Bulls?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Stormhunters?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">They finally realized, who was blocking their path.</span></p><p><span style="">17.</span></p><p><span style="">There were over 200 Users gathered in the Bizma Plain. &#xA0;This large group was hidden as they looked at the battle. &#xA0;A User wearing red robes also looked at the battlefield.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Ah.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">As he watched the battlefield, a phone call arrived.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Hello?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">-Hatch!</span></p><p><span style="">As soon as he picked up the phone, he heard an angry shout. &#xA0;However, he didn&#x2019;t frown or sulk when he heard the angry shout. &#xA0;Instead, he put on a smile as he spoke.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Ah. &#xA0;Who is this?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">- Are you planning on breaking the contract of nonparticipation!</span></p><p><span style="">The caller was Horus.</span></p><p><span style="">Of course, Hatch knew who was calling. &#xA0;He had answered the call knowing Horus had called him.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Ah. &#xA0;What are you talking about?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">-You dare...... &#xA0;How dare you double cross us like this?</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Double cross? &#xA0;Do you know who I am?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">-Hatch!</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Are we on friendly terms? &#xA0;Did we actually form a contract?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">-You son of a bitch! &#xA0;Do you think you&#x2019;ll be able to get away with this?</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I&#x2019;m asking, because I really don&#x2019;t know what you are talking about. &#xA0;What did I do wrong? &#xA0;You said I did something wrong, yet you don&#x2019;t have a contract. &#xA0;Do you have any evidence that&#x2019;ll stand in the court of law?</span></p><p><span style="">-You bastard.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Ah. &#xA0;If you want to talk in more details, you can call up our guild&#x2019;s lawyer. &#xA0;We have a really expensive lawyer on retainer, so you shouldn&#x2019;t do anything rash against us. &#xA0;Ah. &#xA0;I&#x2019;m recording our current conversation. &#xA0;You might be called to court some day, so you should be careful.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">When he ended the call, Hahui approached Hatch.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Who called you?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Ah. &#xA0;It was my girlfriend.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Hatch answered in a flippant manner.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;What?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Hahui had a horrified expression on her face. &#xA0;It was beyond description. &#xA0;Hatch was taken aback when he saw her expression. &#xA0;&#xA0;Her expression was filled with shock, and she looked as if the world was about to fall all around her.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;No, it was someone I know. &#xA0;It was a joke.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Normally, he would tease her, but Hahui&#x2019;s expression was too incredible. &#xA0;Hatch unconsciously stopped himself.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;You surprised me!&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">At Hatch&#x2019;s explanation, Hahui&#x2019;s expression changed instantly.</span></p><p><span style="">She put on a murderous expression again.</span></p><p><span style="">Hahui had on her usual expression, and Hatch was able to come to his senses. &#xA0;He responded in his usual manner.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Why were you surprised when I said I had a girlfriend? &#xA0;This is strange. Are you interested in me? &#xA0;Do you like me?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Instead of answering, Hahui glared at Hatch. &#xA0;The one to end this weird spectacle was Shir.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Was it the Hands guild?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Yes.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">As soon as he answered the question, a User quickly approached them. &#xA0;It was a User wearing an imposing helmet with horns. &#xA0;It was none other than the guild master of the Red Bulls. &#xA0;It was Matador Chev.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;We&#x2019;ve engaged with the Helpers of the Hands guild.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Shir immediately asked a question.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;What&#x2019;s the result?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;They are still in battle...... &#xA0;They are a tough opponent. &#xA0;&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I want you to show them your skill. &#xA0;If you can&#x2019;t do this, there was no point in me paying an exorbitant amount of money to purchase your guild.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Chev let out an awkward smile instead of answering her. &#xA0;He was in a spot now where he had to follow her every order. &#xA0;He couldn&#x2019;t just ignore her words.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I&#x2019;ll do my best.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">At Chev&#x2019;s answer, Shir turned her head instead of answering him. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">They were at the Bizma Plain.</span></p><p><span style="">She looked at the Hahoe Mask, who was dancing with the Barbarian King on a stage made by the Users.</span></p><p><span style="">Hatch carefully spoke to her.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;What will you do if the Hahoe Mask turns down the offer?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;We&#x2019;ll go with our other plan.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Then&#x2026;&#x2026; It&#x2019;ll be war with the Hahoe Mask&#x2026;&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Shir didn&#x2019;t answer him. &#xA0;She looked at the battlefield with an expressionless face.</span></p><p><span style="">16.</span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan hadn&#x2019;t used all his cards yet. &#xA0;Every time he was put in danger, he took out a card. &#xA0;When the 50 Skeleton Warriors he brought initially was turned back into Skeleton Fragments, Hyrkan summoned the Skeleton Knights.</span></p><p><span style="">The Skeleton Knights were on their Skeleton Steeds, and they fearlessly fought against the Barbarian King.</span></p><p><span style="">Hit and run!</span></p><p><span style="">The Skeleton Knights used the mobility of the Skeleton Steed as they performed at optimal level. &#xA0;A less knowledgeable person would probably mistake the Skeleton Knights as Death Knights. &#xA0;In other words, it was evidence that Hyrkan&#x2019;s Skeleton Knights had gone through countless high level battles.</span></p><p><span style="">If it wasn&#x2019;t for Hyrkan, the Skeleton Warriors and Knights wouldn&#x2019;t have such excellent battle AI.</span></p><p><span style="">He was deeply moved.</span></p><p><span style="">It was as if he was a parent looking at his children excel in a brilliant manner.</span></p><p><span style="">However, at a certain point, he stopped himself from being impressed. &#xA0;In the end, the Skeleton Knights could only stall for time.</span></p><p><span style="">Eventually the Skeleton Knights exited the field, and the Golems started to appear in order. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">The four Golems borrowed the appearance of Ogres using the Clay Play Skill. &#xA0;The Golems were large enough to rival the size of the Barbarian King.</span></p><p><span style="">However, the Golems couldn&#x2019;t hold out as long as the Skeleton Knights. &#xA0;The Barbarian King&#x2019;s trunk was powerful enough to destroy the Earth Golem and &#xA0;Ice Golem with a single blow. &#xA0;The demonic spirit of the Barbarian King ate away and crushed the Iron Golem. &#xA0;The Fire Golem was the most pitiful out of the bunch. &#xA0;The Barbarian King ignored the flames created by the Fire Golem. &#xA0;The Fire Golem&#x2019;s fire was like a flame atop a birthday candle to the Barbarian King.</span></p><p><span style="">However, the time bought by the Golems was precious. &#xA0;Hyrkan was able to summon the Death Knight thanks to their sacrifices.</span></p><p><span style="">After appearing, the Death Knight fought the Barbarian King as if to avenge the Golems.</span></p><p><span style="">The Death Knight was the only one that was able to fight on equal grounds with the Barbarian King. &#xA0;The Death Knight didn&#x2019;t retreat.</span></p><p><span style="">When the Death Knight appeared, the [Undying] Skill was immediately activated, and it awoke more Skeleton Warriors and Knight.</span></p><p><span style="">The Skeleton underlings took form again, and they expressed their undying will towards the Barbarian King.</span></p><p><span style="">&apos;Thank you.&apos;</span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan was deeply moved by their efforts.</span></p><p><span style="">&apos;Thank you.&apos;</span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan was thankful of the exploits of his Skeletons.</span></p><p><span style="">[The 31st Protection Gem was destroyed.]</span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan was able to destroy the 31st Protection Gem. &#xA0;It was 48 minutes into the battle.</span></p><p><span style="">At that moment, Hyrkan opened his mouth for the first time.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;The 2nd Phase is starting.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan&#x2019;s voice had been low. &#xA0;A person next to him wouldn&#x2019;t have been able to hear it.</span></p><p><span style="">- The 2nd Phase is starting!</span></p><p><span style="">However, he had spoken through his Voice Talk program.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;The 2nd Phase is starting!&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;The 2nd Phase in starting!</span></p><p><span style="">-The 2nd Phase is starting.!</span></p><p><span style="">It was like an echo. &#xA0;The same phrase filled the battlefield in seconds.</span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan manipulated his watch. &#xA0;He set his watch on the second slot, and he immediately yelled out.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Slot On!&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Goo-roo-roohng!</span></p><p><span style="">At the same time, the heavens let out a sound of warning.</span></p>
