<p><span style="">Chapter 114 - &#xA0;The Foe that Gives Generously (1)</span></p><p>1.</p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Do you want to go with me to the Tehkee tribe?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan had stripped the Barks off the Black Tree, and he severed the tree branches. &#xA0;Hyrkan was taking apart the Black Tree to gain the Ingredient Coins. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">As he was doing this, Whistling just dropped an offer to Hyrkan.</span></p><p><span style="">Whistling&apos;s suggestion was unexpected. &#xA0;It was unexpected for him and Hyrkan.</span></p><p><span style="">Moreover, it was a big deal to be able to go to an Eleven tribe&apos;s village. Under normal circumstances, one had to have the qualification to be able to go there. &#xA0;One needed a Quest or a Title. However, Hyrkan would be able to visit the Tehkee tribe through Whistling. It was an incredible opportunity.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;It&apos;s all right.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">However, Hyrkan turned down the offer.</span></p><p><span style="">Whistling didn&apos;t ask the reason behind the refusal.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I guess it is time for us to part.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;As promised, we won&#x2019;t balance the account for the Coins. If you have something you have to do soon, you can go. &#xA0;Don&apos;t worry about me.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;When I receive the Circlet of Purification from Chieftain Drah, I&apos;ll send it to you.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Since you are already sending it my way, it would be ok if you send another Item with it by mistake.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">They ended the conversation on a very light note. &#xA0;A smile was seen on both their lips, and that was how the conversation had ended.</span></p><p><span style="">The two didn&apos;t make any promises to meet again as they parted from each other.</span></p><p>2.</p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Wow.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan looked at the Ingredient Coins that was filling the bag used for storing his Ingredient Coins. It looked as if it was about to burst. &#xA0;He put on a big grin. &#xA0;His Ingredient Gem bag was also getting close to bursting.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Everything&apos;s better when all the benefit goes to one person.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">After organizing his Ingredient Coins, he scouted out a location where he could immediately log out. &#xA0;He had one more hour of play time left, but Hyrkan decided to logout a bit early.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;I&apos;ll log out first, then I have to sent the original footage and money to the Romani Films.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">He had a lot of things to do.</span></p><p><span style="">When one finishes a great task, a lot of loose ends had to be tied up.</span></p><p><span style="">The first thing he had to do was to commission the Romani Films to produce his video. &#xA0;He had &#xA0;decided to go all out for the purpose of creating a footage he could sell. Of course, he would leave the production of the footage to the Romani Films.</span></p><p><span style="">He had also done a calculation. &#xA0;It was impossible to do an in depth calculation, but at the very least, he could get a rough estimate on how much surplus fund he will gain from this. </span></p><p><span style="">He also had to make changes to something that was the very important to him. &#xA0;He had to change some aspects of his long term plan. </span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan had gained a lot from this Black Tree hunt.</span></p><p><span style="">He also had to worry about what he should do with the Circlet of Purification. </span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Should I sell the Circlet of Purification or not? &#xA0;That is the real question.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">When the Circlet of Purification was put on the market, it wouldn&apos;t just be single Users trying to purchase the Item. &#xA0;The Item was valuable enough for the 30 greats guilds to get involved in the bid.</span></p><p><span style="">What was it worth? </span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;How much can I get&#x2026;&#x2026; It&apos;ll be hard to trade it for gold.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">There was no way he could trade it for gold. &#xA0;The amount was too large to trade. &#xA0;In a situation like this, one usually traded an Item for an Item. If it was the Circlet of Purification, he would easily be able to get a level 150 Unique Set.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Should I aim for the Greenstone Imoogi set?&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">It wouldn&apos;t be hard to pry away the coveted Greenstone Imoogi set. However, if Hyrkan asked for a trade with the guild, V&amp;V might think Hyrkan was trying to cheat them. That might be a reason why the request might be ignored.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;It wouldn&apos;t be too bad for me to use it. I could sell this anytime I want&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">It wasn&#x2019;t a bad idea for Hyrkan to use the Item for himself.</span></p><p><span style="">He would be immune from every negative effect. The beast called Hyrkan might become a much more scarier beast.</span></p><p><span style="">First, there would be no better Item to have when fighting a Boss Monsters. &#xA0;The Boss Monsters were tough to face in the first place, because Fear and other debuff skills reduced the User&apos;s Stats. </span></p><p><span style="">This Item would also be quite useful when fighting other Users. &#xA0;This was especially true for him, since Hyrkan was able to use powerful Curse skills. &#xA0;However, what if Curses and debuff skills didn&apos;t work on him? &#xA0;Hyrkan&apos;s opponents would automatically swear if their skills wouldn&apos;t take hold. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">The cherry on top was the fact that he could sell it after using it. &#xA0;He could get a reasonable price for it no matter when he sold it. </span></p><p><span style="">Of course, one&apos;s watch could be stolen after a PK, and there was a chance that he could lose it. &#xA0;Hyrkan would lose his everloving mind.</span></p><p><span style="">For the time being it was important for him to gain the Black Tree set. &#xA0;He wasn&apos;t sure about this, but he currently had enough Gem ingredients to make 30 parts to the Rare Item set. &#xA0;The 30 parts meant he could make 6 sets.</span></p><p><span style="">The Black Tree set was good enough for him to use, and it could also be sold. &#xA0;If he sold it after using it for a while, he wouldn&apos;t lose too much money. &#xA0;Of course, the Ingredient Coins and Gems could be sold &#xA0;at a higher price compared to pre-made Items. However, the difference wasn&apos;t that big.</span></p><p><span style="">Anyways, Hyrkan&apos;s personal strength had increased by a significant margin. &#xA0;This meant he had to significantly alter his plans.</span></p><p><span style="">However, one thing was for sure. &#xA0;This was bad news for the groups, who would have to fight against Hyrkan. What happened this day was an unfavorable development for them.</span></p><p>3.</p><p><span style="">Whistling discreetly touched his forehead. &#xA0;Whistling had a very bizarre expression on his face. He felt happy, yet even his happy face looked rugged and ill-tempered. &#xA0;It was terrifying. &#xA0;As an outside observer, he had a face that was hard to read... &#xA0;It was a form of a poker face.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;This isn&apos;t bad.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">Whistling had this expression on his face, because he had just finished the Quest related to the Tehkee tribe.</span></p><p><span style="">The tribe had been saved from the Black Tree&apos;s Curse, so everyone had expressed their thanks to him.</span></p><p><span style="">First, he got three substantial Titles. &#xA0;One of the Titles gave a percentage increase to his Stats.</span></p><p><span style="">On top of that, he had gained two Items that were considered to be the treasures of the Tehkee tribe. &#xA0;He earned a level 150 Unique Rank sword, and gloves. &#xA0;The Options on these Items were very good. &#xA0;Amongst the Level 150 Unique Items, these were in the top bracket. </span></p><p><span style="">Also, these were Bound Items, so it was impossible to trade them. &#xA0;However, Whistling didn&apos;t care about that.</span></p><p><span style="">Something else had put Whistling in a good mood. &#xA0;A young elven girl had given a flower she picked from a tree she had grown to Whistling. &#xA0;She also planted an adorable kiss on his forehead.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;This isn&apos;t bad at all.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">He replayed that moment again. He had a happy expression from the memory, and Whistling walked towards the Puree Village.</span></p><p><span style="">He didn&apos;t have a significant reason behind his visit to the Puree village. &#xA0;It was a place where one could hear information regarding the Pure forest. &#xA0;One was also able to check the market rates, and the consumable items he needed could be purchased there. &#xA0;&#xA0;The consumable items that could be traded for at the Puree Forest was more expensive than the market value, but it didn&apos;t matter to Whistling. He had a lot of money.</span></p><p><span style="">Moreover, he had visited the Puree Village several times, and he never run across trouble before.</span></p><p><span style="">However, it was different this time around.</span></p><p><span style="">When he crossed the gate into the Puree Village, the Big Smiles guild member looked at him with a different expression on his face than usual. &#xA0;His changed expression and his continuously moving lips meant that he was having an emergency call with some unknown person. &#xA0;At the very least, it was very unlikely that this User was mumbling to himself.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Something is going on.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">Whistling recognized the change in the atmosphere. He guessed something out of the ordinary was about to happen.</span></p><p><span style="">As if to answer his prediction, ten Users appeared. &#xA0;They didn&apos;t just appear. &#xA0;They were situated in positions that made it look like they were surrounding him. </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Whistling Pitbull.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">There were 10 of them. The 10 Users were wearing mismatched armors, so one couldn&apos;t see a unified theme between them. &#xA0;However, the Big Smiles emblem on their chests identified them clearly.</span></p><p><span style="">The Users from the Big Smiles guild surrounded Whistling.</span></p><p><span style="">Whistling didn&apos;t check the faces of the Users surrounding him. &#xA0;A fighting dog didn&apos;t care about his surrounding.</span></p><p><span style="">His attention was focused on one person.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Who is that?&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">He only glared at his prey and victim.</span></p><p><span style="">Whistling glared at the person, who had called out his nickname. This User looked completely different from Whistling.</span></p><p><span style="">He had a corpulent body that made one feel sorry for the armors he was wearing. &#xA0;Whistling was reticent to think this, but the User in front of him was uglier than him. However, this fat User had a presence about him that one wouldn&apos;t be able to forget after seeing him once.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What does Big Smiles guild want with me?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Whistling took up the banter. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Want? That&apos;s what I want to ask you. &#xA0;How dare a guild member of the Fighters guild operate out of our territory so boldly? I want to ask you the same question. &#xA0;What business brings you here?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">The thoughts within Whistling&apos;s head became complicated. He had been visiting this place without any trouble until now, so why were they suddenly behaving like this?</span></p><p><span style="">Instead of worrying over it, he immediately replied with a question.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What is your name?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">He was a regular guild member, but Whistling was still a member of a big guild called the Fighters guild.</span></p><p><span style="">The User trying to pick a fight with him was a member of the Big Smiles guild. &#xA0;Moreover, there was a high probability that he was an officer.</span></p><p><span style="">Of course, if the two of them fought, this wouldn&apos;t be a personal matter any more. &#xA0;It would be an incident between two guilds. One had to check each other&apos;s rank to avoid unnecessary trouble. &#xA0;It would be best to prevent accidents from happening. &#xA0;Of course, if one was purposefully causing an incident, it was a whole different story.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Apollo.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">As if his opponent understood this, he revealed his name.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I am an officer of the Big Smiles guild.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">He revealed his rank.</span></p><p><span style="">At that point, Whistling became a bit suspicious.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Apollo? There was someone like him amongst the officers in Big Smile?&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">He had been disinterested in guild politics, so of course, Whistling hadn&#x2019;t memorized the names of all the officers in the 30 great guilds. </span></p><p><span style="">Still, he had never even heard a single rumor about an officer with such a corpulent body. &#xA0;Moreover, Apollo&apos;s appearance was memorable. If he had a brief encounter with Apollo, he would have remembered it.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;No one would dare to impersonate an officer of the Big Smiles guild here. &#xA0;That&apos;s the truth.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">He determined it wasn&apos;t possible for someone to impersonate oneself as an officer of the Big Smiles guild inside the Puree village. &#xA0;This village was under their jurisdiction, and this User was wearing the Big Smiles guild emblem.</span></p><p><span style="">Then....</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I&apos;m moving by myself through the Puree Forest. &#xA0;Why would that be a problem? &#xA0;I&apos;m not even in a party.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;It wouldn&apos;t have been a problem if you had asked for permission.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Permission?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;You should have asked with sincerity. I would have believed in your sincerity if you had come bowing your head.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">His opponent was openly provoking Whistling. &#xA0;That was obvious.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Hoohng.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">At that point, Whistling didn&apos;t have any complicated thoughts. &#xA0;In the first place, he wasn&apos;t the type to use his head in such a situation.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Come at me.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Choo-roong! </span></p><p><span style="">Whistling immediately unsheathed the sword hanging from his waist.</span></p><p>4.</p><p><span style="">After a break, Hyrkan connected to the game. When Hyrkan gained access to the game, he quickly moved with his full bags containing the Ingredient Coins. His foot speed was much lighter than it had ever been.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Did he already send it?&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan was running, and the thought of the Circlet of Purification made his feet feel much lighter.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Ah. I hope the Circlet of Purification is there when I arrive at the Item Storage facility.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">The Circlet of Purification was working better than a Haste skill in increasing Hyrkan&#x2019;s speed.</span></p><p><span style="">However, Hyrkan came to a stop when he realized a group was quickly coming towards him.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Huh?&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan stopped as a matter of course, and he hid himself.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;What&apos;s this?&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">He had stopped as a matter of course, but in truth, this wasn&apos;t a normal procedure for regular Users. &#xA0;Normally, when one comes across other Users, one either ignored or greeted them. &#xA0;Only the shady Users hid themselves. &#xA0;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">However, Hyrkan was unique. He had already gone through unspeakable hardships and suffering. The entire world of Warlord had been his enemy once. &#xA0;He had a habit of hiding himself when a large group approached his direction. &#xA0;It was a very sad habit.</span></p><p><span style="">After Hyrkan hid himself, three Users quickly rushed by Hyrkan&apos;s location. &#xA0;They were checking every direction, but they didn&#x2019;t catch sight of Hyrkan. &#xA0;The three Users shared a brief conversation.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Shit. &#xA0;Where did that guy run to?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;We can&apos;t catch him. How are we suppose to catch a single User in such a vast land? &#xA0;When we lost him at the village that was the end.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">After the brief conversation, they immediately moved into the distance. However, Hyrkan kept himself hidden even after they disappeared. &#xA0;He closed his eyes, and he thought about what he had just witnessed. </span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;There were three of them with the Big Smiles guild emblem....&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">The three Users that just passed by were affiliated with the Big Smiles guild.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;If I consider their running speed and Item Setting, they are Striker Type Users.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">On top of that, they were Swordsman Class Users, who had increased their Strength Stat. They all seemed to be chasing after someone.</span></p><p><span style="">Something was afoot.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Who are they chasing after that they felt the need to form a pursuit party?&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">A normal hunting party never consisted of three Strikers unless they were running away. &#xA0;Even then it was more common to see Strikers disperse when running away.</span></p><p><span style="">In the end, it meant the three members of the Big Smiles guild was a part of a pursuit party. A pursuit party had been formed to hunt down a normal User. &#xA0;It meant they were hellbent at hunting down this User.</span></p><p><span style="">At that moment, Hyrkan thought for a brief moment.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Hmmm.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">He didn&apos;t have any good feelings towards the Big Smiles guild. Moreover, he didn&apos;t know what their intentions were.</span></p><p><span style="">However, Hyrkan didn&apos;t feel the need to dip his toe into something annoying. &#xA0;He had been planning on bypassing the Puree village in the off chance that a problem might occur.</span></p><p><span style="">In truth, he didn&apos;t even need to think about it. &#xA0;It didn&apos;t matter, who the Big Smiles guild was chasing down. &#xA0;It had nothing to do with Hyrkan.</span></p><p><span style="">He would ignore it. &#xA0;That was the wisest course.</span></p><p><span style="">It happened when he was about to choose the wise course of action.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;He&apos;s over there. There!&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">The three Users had doubled back towards Hyrkan&apos;s location.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Are they perhaps aiming for me?&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan discreetly put his hand into his pocket to grasp the Skeleton Fragments.</span></p><p><span style="">However, they just rushed past Hyrkan. &#xA0;Hyrkan extracted the hand that had been touching his Skeleton Fragments.</span></p><p><span style="">As the group was getting farther away, one User let out a shout.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Let&apos;s hunt down that fighting dog!&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan had a reason to move now.</span></p>
