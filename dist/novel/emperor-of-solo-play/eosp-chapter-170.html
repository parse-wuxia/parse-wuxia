</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Yes, it is as I thought.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">They were placed at the entrance to the King&apos;s Tomb. &#xA0;These statues were guarding the entrance, and they would awaken to test the intruders within the King&apos;s Tomb.</span></p><p><span style="">[The Guardian Knights of the King&apos;s Tomb is glaring down at you.] </span></p><p><span style="">The examiners of the test located the intruder.</span></p><p><span style="">Koo koo koo! </span></p><p><span style="">The two statues let out a heavy sound as they lowered their heads. &#xA0;They stared at Hyrkan, who stood behind the threshold of the entrance.</span></p><p><span style="">Their faces were carved from stone, so they didn&apos;t have functioning eyes. &#xA0;They couldn&apos;t make expressions, yet Hyrkan felt the glare coming from the statues. &#xA0;It was as if they wanted squash him like a bug.</span></p><p><span style="">However, they didn&apos;t immediately attack Hyrkan. &#xA0;They just looked at Hyrkan.</span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan was still within the King&apos;s Tomb.</span></p><p><span style="">They couldn&apos;t point or swing their swords towards the King&apos;s Tomb.</span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan had already realized this fact, so he let out a bitter laugh.</span></p><p><span style="">Maybe, this was a mercy. &#xA0;Currently, the Guardian Knights were showing their own form of mercy towards Hyrkan.</span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan didn&apos;t feel good about receiving such leniency from them. &#xA0;Monsters were looking down on him, so there was no reason why he would feel good about it.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;All right.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">At that moment, Hyrkan came to a decision.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Let&apos;s try this.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">He&apos;ll kill them.</span></p><p><span style="">He&apos;ll willingly pass the test.</span></p><p><span style="">No, he&apos;ll punish those, who look down on him.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;I&apos;ll make you pay for allowing me to make preparations.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">He started his summons.</span></p><p><span style="">The Guardian Knight wouldn&apos;t attack Hyrkan until he exited the the King&apos;s Tomb. &#xA0;Basically, Hyrkan had the luxury to summon all the underlings he wanted.</span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan planted a sword in the ground. &#xA0;It immediately gushed out black steel liquid.</span></p><p><span style="">While the black steel liquid was rushing outwards, Hyrkan took out two gems, and he gripped them in each hand.</span></p><p><span style="">Ddook dook! </span></p><p><span style="">The gem in his right hand became liquefied, and it fell to the floor.</span></p><p><span style="">Hwah-roo-roo! </span></p><p><span style="">The gem in his left hand was clenched as fire poured out from his fist.</span></p><p><span style="">[Iron Golem was summoned.] </span></p><p><span style="">A black Iron Golem had appeared.</span></p><p><span style="">[You&apos;ve summoned a Golem.] </span></p><p><span style="">The gem allowed him to form an Earth Golem in the shape of an Ogre.</span></p><p><span style="">[The Fire Golem &#xA0;was summoned.] </span></p><p><span style="">When he unclenched his fists, a griffin appeared from the surging flames. &#xA0;The Fire Golem had made its appearance.</span></p><p><span style="">The three Golems took form, &#xA0;yet the Guardian Knights refused to move. &#xA0;They continued to stare down at Hyrkan. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan mocked the statues as he took out a thumb sized blue gem from the pouch on his waist. &#xA0;He held the gem inside his mouth using his teeth.</span></p><p><span style="">He was just biting on the gem, yet his magical energy was quickly being replenished.</span></p><p><span style="">While it replenished, Hyrkan unfastened his wristwatch. &#xA0;When he grasped his unbound wristwatch, the empty air started to split open. &#xA0;From the rip in space, the undying Knight slowly appeared from within this crack.</span></p><p><span style="">[The Death Knight was summoned.] </span></p><p><span style="">The Death Knight riding its Skeleton Steed, and it looked imposing.</span></p><p><span style="">Kwah-jeek! </span></p><p><span style="">At that moment, he crushed the blue gem being held in place by his teeth.</span></p><p><span style="">When he crushed the gem, a strong taste of mint filled the inside of Hyrkan&apos;s mouth. &#xA0;The mint taste was so strong that it was spicy. &#xA0;Hyrkan endured the minty taste.</span></p><p><span style="">Patience was bitter, but the result was sweet.</span></p><p><span style="">The Death Knight&#x2019;s summoning had bottomed out his magical energy, yet it was quickly filling up now. &#xA0;The speed couldn&apos;t be compared to before.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Open the Power of Frost.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Then he sacrificed his full magical energy to activate the Ancient Power of Frost.</span></p><p><span style="">Finally, Hyrkan stepped out out of the King&apos;s Tomb.</span></p><p><span style="">[The Guardian Knights will test you!] </span></p><p><span style="">The test began.</span></p><p>8.</p><p><span style="">The earth Golem borrowed the form of an Ogre using the Clay Play Skill, and it was almost 8 meters tall. &#xA0;This was why the Ogre Golem was able to look eye to eye with the Guardian Knights, and it would be able to fight the statues for supremacy.</span></p><p><span style="">On the other hand, the small size of the Griffin Fire Golem was a moot point. &#xA0;It had wings, and it had the ability to fly. &#xA0;The Griffin Fire Golem was already flapping its wings, and the Guardian Knights was beneath its flying form.</span></p><p><span style="">The only one to appear in its original form was the Iron Golem, and it was quite lacking compared to the other two Golems. &#xA0;It was stocky, yet it was only 4 meters tall. &#xA0;It looked small in a battlefield where the giants fought. &#xA0;While its body was small, it was made out of steel. &#xA0;It had a dignified air to it.</span></p><p><span style="">In this battle of the giants, the last to join was the Death Knight. &#xA0;It appeared riding the Skeleton Steed, and it also looked very small amongst these giants. &#xA0;However, the Death Knight didn&apos;t back away. &#xA0;Instead, it sat on the Skeleton Steed as it refused to pull out its sword. &#xA0;It was as if the Death Knight was allowing the Guardian Knights to make the first move. &#xA0;The Death Knight was looking down on the Guardian Knights, and its manner was dignified and imposing.</span></p><p><span style="">These six being closed the distance. &#xA0;None were in a hurry. &#xA0;It would be enough to act with urgency after the battle had started.</span></p><p><span style="">Then the battle started.</span></p><p><span style="">Hoo-oohng! </span></p><p><span style="">The first move was taken by the Guardian Knights. &#xA0;One took a swing at the Iron Golem, and the other swung its sword at the Ogre Golem.</span></p><p><span style="">The Guardian Knights held swords carved out of stone. &#xA0;Basically, it was a chunk of rock. &#xA0;It was fascinating to see such a heavy weapon part the winds. &#xA0;Moreover, it wasn&apos;t simply parting the air. &#xA0;It was swiftly cutting through the air.</span></p><p><span style="">It was terrifying.</span></p><p><span style="">Instead of dodging the terrifying sword strike of the Guardian Knight, the Ogre Golem swung the stone axe in its hand.</span></p><p><span style="">It blocked an attack with its own attack! </span></p><p><span style="">It was a very ogre-like act.</span></p><p><span style="">Ggwah-ah-ahng! </span></p><p><span style="">A thunderous sounded exploded forth as two pieces of rock clashed against each other. &#xA0;Accompanying the thunderous sound, the head of the Ogre Golem&#x2019;s stone axe was chipped. &#xA0;On the other hand, a crack appeared on the Guardian Knight&apos;s sword, and a golden light was emitted by the sword. &#xA0;The true weapon was hidden underneath a layer of rock. &#xA0;The sword showed its true self. &#xA0;If the Ogre Golem was able to speak, it would have called the Guardian Knight a cheater.</span></p><p><span style="">Wah-roo-roo-roohk! </span></p><p><span style="">As if to avenge the Ogre Golem, the Griffin Fire Golem let out a stream of fire towards the head of the Guardian Knight.</span></p><p><span style="">At the same time, there was another fierce battle occurring nearby. &#xA0;This battle also started with the Guardian Knight swinging its sword. &#xA0;While one Guardian Knight swung its sword towards the Ogre Golem, the other Guardian Knight swung its sword toward the Iron Golem.</span></p><p><span style="">Hoo-oohng! </span></p><p><span style="">As expected, it was a terrifying attack. &#xA0;However, the Iron Golem couldn&apos;t dodge the attack, and it had no plans to do so. &#xA0;It decided to take on the Guardian Knight&apos;s sword with its head and body.</span></p><p><span style="">Ggwahhhhng! </span></p><p><span style="">A loud sound exploded forth once again. &#xA0;It wasn&apos;t simply a loud noise. &#xA0;It was a thunderous roar that could be heard nowhere else. &#xA0;Moreover, the result of this sound was horrifying. &#xA0;There was a big divot in the head of the Iron Golem&apos;s hard head. &#xA0;If it was a living creature, it would have died instantly.</span></p><p><span style="">Moreover, when the Guardian Knight&apos;s sword impacted on the Iron Golem, it also revealed a gold light.</span></p><p><span style="">Puhl-jjuhk! </span></p><p><span style="">The one to avenge the Iron Golem was the Death Knight. &#xA0;The Skeleton Steed leapt into the air. &#xA0;Thanks to the Skeleton Steed&apos;s leap, the Death Knight was able to take a swing at the Guardian Knight&apos;s neck.</span></p><p><span style="">Puh-uhk! </span></p><p><span style="">The Death Knight&apos;s sword cut at the left side of the Guardian Knight&apos;s neck. &#xA0;A deep cut appeared on the Guardian Knight&apos;s armor, which was made from stone.</span></p><p><span style="">This was how the battle between two Guardian Knights, three Golems and a Death Knight started.</span></p><p><span style="">This terrifying battle was filled with fearsome sounds.</span></p><p><span style="">Hoo-oohng! </span></p><p><span style="">It was the sound of the Guardian Knights swinging its heavy sword.</span></p><p><span style="">Ggwah-ahng!</span></p><p><span style="">There was the Ogre Golem&apos;s stone axe hitting the body of the Guardian Knights.</span></p><p><span style="">Ggahhng!</span></p><p><span style="">This was the sound of the Iron Golem resisting the fearsome attack of the Guardian Knight.</span></p><p><span style="">Hwah-roo-roo!</span></p><p><span style="">Then there was the sound of an enormous flame emanating from the Griffin Fire Golem.</span></p><p><span style="">Shweek! &#xA0;Shweek!</span></p><p><span style="">On top of it all, the sharp sounds of the sword being swung by the Death Knight was heard.</span></p><p><span style="">Various sounds filled the battlefield, and small sounds were drowned out.</span></p><p><span style="">In truth, the Skeleton Warriors and the Skeleton Knight summoned with the Death Knight wasn&apos;t able to do much. &#xA0;They were like dogs at the feet of fighting elephants. &#xA0;They could struggle to not be stomped on by the elephant&apos;s feet, but that was all they could do.</span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan threw his body in the battlefield.</span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan was the smallest combatant, and he looked like a shrimp entering into a fight between whales.</span></p><p><span style="">Of course, there was no hesitation to Hyrkan&apos;s movements.</span></p><p><span style="">Koong koong!</span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan deftly avoided the footsteps of the Golems and the Guardian Knights. &#xA0;Each of their steps were filled with enormous power, and their footsteps shook the ground. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">In a flash, Hyrkan stuck to the leg of a Guardian Knight.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hoo-ooh!&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan took in short breaths as he climbed up the leg of the Guardian Knight as if it was a cliff.</span></p><p><span style="">Koo-oohng, koo-oohng! </span></p><p><span style="">He continuously climbed this shaking cliff. &#xA0;It was impossible to do such a feat with just pure strength.</span></p><p><span style="">However, this task was easy for Hyrkan. &#xA0;He had learned climbing in the virtual space, and it was something he was better than anyone in the world.</span></p><p><span style="">It really was as if Hyrkan was walking across a flat ground. &#xA0;He quickly went up the leg of the Guardian Knight.</span></p><p><span style="">Ggoohk! </span></p><p><span style="">As he climbed, he stuck a Skeleton Fragment in any cracks he came across. &#xA0;Hyrkan continued to climb up after placing these Skeleton Fragments, and they took shape as Skeleton Warriors. &#xA0;They looked like ticks that lived parasitically on one&apos;s skin. &#xA0;Moreover, these Skeleton Warriors were letting out white breath from their mouth.</span></p><p><span style="">The Skeleton Warriors showed the path Hyrkan had taken. &#xA0;Hyrkan climbed atop the Guardian Knight&apos;s back, and he moved towards the right shoulder. &#xA0;Seven Skeleton Warriors had taken form behind him, and they attempted to injure the body of the Guardian Knight.</span></p><p><span style="">However, from the perspective of the Guardian Knight, it was as if it was being attacked by mosquitoes. &#xA0;Still, this was also the reason why it couldn&apos;t leave them alone. &#xA0;They were poking at its body, so how could it leave them be?</span></p><p><span style="">The Guardian Knight tried to dislodge the Frost Skeleton Warriors when it had the luxury to do so.</span></p><p><span style="">When it did, the Ogre Golem and the Griffin Fire Golem used this opportunity to attack the Guardian Knight.</span></p><p><span style="">In such a situation, the Guardian Knight didn&apos;t have the luxury to pay attention to Hyrkan, who had climbed up to its right shoulder.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;I&apos;ll start with the shoulder.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan planted his sword in the Guardian Knight&apos;s right shoulder.</span></p><p><span style="">Kwah-jeek! &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">His sword was able to pierce 10 centimeters. &#xA0;However, his sword was having a hard time penetrating deeper.</span></p><p><span style="">Ggahng! </span></p><p><span style="">Instead, he felt an increased resistance.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;There is something underneath it.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">At that moment, the Guardian Knight&apos;s left hand came flying in toward Hyrkan, who was on its shoulder.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Tsk.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan dodged the hand, and he moved to the nape of the Guardian Knight&apos;s neck. &#xA0;Then he immediately climbed down towards its back. &#xA0;Of course, the Guardian Knight&apos;s hand couldn&apos;t easily reach that spot. </span></p><p><span style="">Ggwah-ahng! </span></p><p><span style="">While the Guardian Knight was distracted, the Ogre Golem&apos;s stone axe impacted on the Guardian Knight&apos;s body.</span></p><p><span style="">As usual, a large boom rang out, and the Guardian Knight&apos;s body was rocked. &#xA0;The Guardian Knight ignored Hyrkan again, and it looked at the Ogre Golem. &#xA0;It swung its sword towards the Ogre Golem.</span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan quickly climbed to the shoulder region again.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;If I can&apos;t stab it...&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">He planted a Bone Explosive within the wound he created.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;I&apos;ll just blow it up.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">Kwahng! </span></p><p><span style="">The Bone Explosive exploded immediately.</span></p><p><span style="">However, he wasn&apos;t satisfied with just detonating the Bone Explosives. &#xA0;The region affected by the explosion became frozen. &#xA0;At that moment, the Guardian Knight tried to move its left arm.</span></p><p><span style="">Zzuh-juhk, zzuh-juhk! </span></p><p><span style="">The ice stuck to the right shoulder couldn&apos;t take the rough movements of the Guardian Knight. &#xA0;It started to crack.</span></p><p><span style="">Of course, the ice also made the Guardian Knight move slower.</span></p><p><span style="">This wasn&apos;t the end of the attack.</span></p><p><span style="">The Skeleton Knights stuck to the body of the Guardian Knight, and their added power of Frost was slowly making the Guardian Knight heavier and unresponsive.</span></p><p><span style="">When he saw this, Hyrkan took out a new Bone Explosive.</span></p><p>9.</p><p><span style="">Koo-oohnng! </span></p><p><span style="">When the Guardian Knight took a knee, the ground shook.</span></p><p><span style="">The kneeling Guardian Knight was full of wounds. The indomitable body was damaged to a point where one couldn&apos;t tell what it looked like originally. &#xA0;The stone surrounding its body were mostly broken away, and the Guardian Knight revealed the golden layer beneath. &#xA0;The exposed golden layer was also in rough shape.</span></p><p><span style="">However, the most damning part was the fact that it was on its knee. &#xA0;When a knight was on its knee, it was a declaration of defeat. &#xA0;In a knight&apos;s battle, defeat meant death.</span></p><p><span style="">The Guardian Knight no longer got up. &#xA0;It didn&apos;t move an inch. &#xA0;It had lost, and subsequently, it accepted its death.</span></p><p><span style="">[The Fire Golem Skill Rank has increased to Rank B.] </span></p><p><span style="">[The Iron Golem Skill Rank has increased to Rank D.] </span></p><p><span style="">[Death Knight Skill Rank has increased to Rank C.] </span></p><p><span style="">[You&apos;ve earned the title &apos;Being who took down the Guardian Knights&apos;.] </span></p><p><span style="">[You&apos;ve earned the title &apos;Being who Passed the King&apos;s Test&apos;] </span></p><p><span style="">[You&apos;ve completed the Quest &apos;Ancient King&apos;s Test&apos;. Please find the King&apos;s Treasure within the body of the Guardian Knight.] </span></p><p><span style="">There was nothing that assured the defeat of the Guardian Knights more than the consecutive System Announcement heard in Hyrkan&apos;s ears.</span></p><p><span style="">Instead of a cheer of happiness, Hyrkan let out a deep sigh.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;It was harder than I thought.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan stood on top of the kneeling Guardian Knight&apos;s shoulder, and he looked at his surrounding.</span></p><p><span style="">The first thing he saw was his Iron Golem. &#xA0;It was dented so much that it looked pitiful. &#xA0;It was miraculous that it was still moving.</span></p><p><span style="">Then there was the remains of the earth Golem. &#xA0;In the end, it couldn&apos;t stand up against the repeated attacks from the Guardian Knight, so it had returned to being a pile of dirt.</span></p><p><span style="">The fire Golem was also in the same boat as the earth Golem. &#xA0;At a certain point, Hyrkan&apos;s magic consumption outstripped the recovery speed. &#xA0;When Hyrkan&apos;s magical energy became zero, the Fire Golem was snuffed out like a candle blown out by the wind.</span></p><p><span style="">The Death Knight and its Skeleton Steed still stood in an imposing manner, but its armor was full of wounds. &#xA0;The pristine appearance from when it was first summoned was no longer to be seen. &#xA0;It looked like a straggler.</span></p><p><span style="">Since it could no longer use its Undying skill, most of the summoned Skeleton Warriors and Skeleton Knight didn&#x2019;t regenerate. &#xA0;Only two Skeleton Warriors remained.</span></p><p><span style="">It had been an arduous victory.</span></p><p><span style="">Moreover, Hyrkan had used all of his consumable Items in this battle.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;This fucking game.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">At that moment, he had a thought.</span></p><p><span style="">&apos;I worked like a dog. &#xA0;If the reward isn&apos;t anything special... &#xA0;I would flip this game on its head.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">He had worked so hard, yet if his reward was subpar, he would never accept it!</span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan made this resolution, and he turned the dial of his wristwatch. &#xA0;He switched his Item.</span></p><p><span style="">Choo-roong, choo-rong! </span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan was holding the Crying Sword instead of the Deposed Prince&apos;s sword. &#xA0;Hyrkan used the tip of the Crying Sword to destroy the Guardian Knight&apos;s golden body, which had been beneath a layer of stone. </span></p><p><span style="">Choo-roong, choo-roong! </span></p><p><span style="">The Crying Sword let out a sorrowful cry as it was used like a pickaxe.</span></p><p><span style="">How long had he been working on this task?</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Uh?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">He was able to split open the Guardian Knight&apos;s golden body, and the King&apos;s Treasure saw the light of day.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Black b&#xB7;&#xB7;&#xB7;&#xB7;&#xB7;&#xB7;No, is it a red box?&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">It was the King&apos;s Treasure. &#xA0;It was a Legendary Rank Ancient power.</span></p><p>10.</p><p><span style="">&#x201C;In the end, we came back here again.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Hatch swiveled his head as he spoke. &#xA0;He looked at the large ridge that blocked his line of sight. &#xA0;This large mountain range&apos;s size was comparable to the Urugal mountain range. &#xA0;The ridge was covered with black trees. &#xA0;It was imposing, and it gave off an ominous feeling.</span></p><p><span style="">The name of the mountain was Black Comb.</span></p><p><span style="">It was a name meant to describe the dark peak of the mountain.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;It really is a Block Field.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I&apos;m already well aware of that! &#xA0;You don&apos;t have to tell me!&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Hahui shot her words toward Hatch. &#xA0;They had worked hard to find a path with no Block Field yet they had returned to the starting point. &#xA0;Hahui&apos;s mood was already at its worst.</span></p><p><span style="">This was also true for Hatch.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes, I see. &#xA0;You are so knowledgeable that you tried to hug a Werebear, because it was cute? &#xA0;Is that why you almost died?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">It seemed Hatch didn&apos;t want to lose. &#xA0;He fought words with words.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hey! &#xA0;You want to die?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Their war of words continued on. &#xA0;There was only one person, who could stop these two from fighting, and Shir wasn&apos;t here right now. &#xA0;Since Shir wasn&apos;t here, the guild members didn&apos;t plan on stopping such an entertaining sight. &#xA0;They also didn&apos;t have the energy to intervene.</span></p><p><span style="">Several guild members even started a betting pool as they watched Hatch and Hahui fight.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;This time I&apos;ll bet 10 gold on Hatch.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I still think Hahui will win. &#xA0;I&apos;ll put 10 gold on Hahui&apos;s victory.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">The guild members started up a conversation with the fight as a background.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;The Barbarian King Quest is more complicated than expected. &#xA0;We haven&apos;t been able to find any clues regarding the quest.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;The Golden Conch wants us to go east, and it wants us to cross the mountain. &#xA0;However, the Block Field prevents us from crossing it, and we keep being sent back to the starting point....&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;This means the Block Field has to be dismissed before we can follow the direction of the Golden Conch. &#xA0;This Quest is troublesome.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Hatch, who had been fighting Hahui with words, raised his hand towards her.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;How dare you!&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Hahui reacted negatively to the gesture.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes, Queen.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Hatch ignored Hahui&apos;s words, and he answered the call. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">Hahui immediately shut her mouth.</span></p><p><span style="">The power of Shir&apos;s call didn&apos;t ended there. &#xA0;When the call started, all the conversations in the surrounding stopped. &#xA0;They all tried to hear the conversation between Hatch and Shir. </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes. &#xA0;We weren&#x2019;t able to cross the Black Comb again. &#xA0;The cause was the Block field, and we haven&apos;t encountered any special Quest or Boss Monster. &#xA0;The only sure instruction we have is from the Golden Conch. &#xA0;It wants us to keep heading east, yet we can&apos;t... &#xA0;It means there is another Quest that we&apos;ll have to complete. &#xA0;This is separate from the Barbarian King Quest.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">As he was giving his report, a weird expression blossomed on his face.</span></p><p><span style="">Hatch quickly covered his mouth. He activated the Mute mode. &#xA0;It was a gesture that allowed a private conversation with the person on the other end of the Voice Talk.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;So you want me to talk to the First Head? &#xA0;Yes, I understand. &#xA0;If &#xA0;you want me to, I&apos;ll do it. &#xA0;I&apos;ll immediately go make preparations.&#x201D;</span></p>
