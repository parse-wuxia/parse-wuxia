<p><span style="">Chapter 104- There is No Free Lunch (1)</span></p><p><span style="">In Warlord, one could transfer an Item from acquired watch through the fence NPC.</span></p><p><span style="">Of course, the fence NPC was located in a neighborhood with a menacing atmosphere. &#xA0;It was common to see Users, who lost tehir items through PK, to stake out near the fence NPC. This was why sometimes one might meet one&#x2019;s enemies near the fence.</span></p><p><span style="">Of course, fights didn&apos;t occur around the NPC. &#xA0;There was a tacit agreement that forbid PK near the fence. &#xA0;If one broke this unwritten rule, the User would suffer much more damage than actually losing a single watch.</span></p><p><span style="">This was the reason why everyone kept their manners. &#xA0;The only thing they could do was glare at other Users with murderous intent. &#xA0;This worsened the menacing atmosphere around the fence. There was a saying in Warlord that said, &apos;If you want to experience an intense atmosphere, go near a fence instead of going to a Boss Raid!&apos;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;My commission is 1 gold..&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">In such a rough atmosphere, those who can&apos;t keep their cool became the prey.</span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan knew this better than anyone. &#xA0;However, Hyrkan&#x2019;s expression indicated otherwise.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;The commission fee is 1 gold. Are you perhaps trying to cheat me out of my commission?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">The fence NPC continued to speak in a threatening manner. &#xA0;As if he finally came to his senses, Hyrkan put his hand into his pocket. &#xA0;When Hyrkan finally took out a coin, Hyrkan&apos;s expression changed. It was as if he had a couple screws loose. He had a silly smile on his face.</span></p><p><span style="">In the end, Hyrkan handed over the gold coin to the fence. </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Huh?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">The coin wasn&apos;t engraved with the number one. &#xA0;It had the number 10 imprinted on it.</span></p><p><span style="">It was worth 10 gold.</span></p><p><span style="">This wasn&apos;t a small amount of money. &#xA0;In real money, it was worth around 100 dollars. No one in the right mind would pay 100 dollars for a 10 dollar service. &#xA0;Moreover, this fence NPC didn&apos;t give back change.</span></p><p><span style="">Didn&apos;t Hyrkan put his life on the line for .1 gold before?</span></p><p><span style="">Something extraordinary was going on here.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;My commission is one gold.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">This was something that could be corrected immediately. </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;It&apos;s a tip.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">However, Hyrkan left the 10 gold in place. &#xA0;He immediately left after taking the Item.</span></p><p><span style="">The fence looked at Hyrkan with its head tilted in confusion. &#xA0;The fence NPC didn&apos;t chase after a User if they overpaid. This scenario hadn&apos;t been programmed.</span></p><p><span style="">The fence&apos;s expression immediately reverted to its normal expression, and it got ready for the new customer.</span></p><p><span style="">[Helm Imbued with the Greenstone Imoogi&apos;s Soul] </span></p><p><span style="">*Main Properties</span></p><p><span style="">- Unique-rank Item</span></p><p><span style="">- Strength +144 </span></p><p><span style="">- Stamina +144 </span></p><p><span style="">- Required Level : 150 </span></p><p><span style="">*Sub-properties </span></p><p><span style="">- The Wearer&apos;s Stamina recovery speed is increased by 5%</span></p><p><span style="">- If one equips set items&#x2018;Imbued with the Greenstone Imoogi&apos;s Soul&#x2019;, class-specific stat increases</span></p><p><span style="">- If three parts of the set item &#x2018;Imbued with the Greenstone Imoogi&apos;s Soul&#x2019; is equipped, all Stat will be increased by +50</span></p><p><span style="">- If five parts of the set item &#x2018;Imbued with the Greenstone Imoogi&apos;s Soul&#x2019; is equipped, all Stat will be increased by +100</span></p><p><span style="">- If five parts of the set item &#x2018;Imbued with the Greenstone Imoogi&apos;s Soul&#x2019; is equipped, the &apos;Greenstone Imoogi&apos;s Curse&apos; is activated</span></p><p><span style="">*Miscellaneous </span></p><p><span style="">- The essence of a Greenstone Imoogi with a vengeful spirit is dwelling with the Item.</span></p><p><span style="">He looked at the Stat of the Item stored in his storage. &#xA0;Ahn-jaehyun checked the Stats once again, and he let out a sigh that was filled with mixed emotions.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Wow.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">He had read the Item&apos;s Option so much that it had been imprinted into his brain. &#xA0;However, his heart started pounding when he started reading the Item&apos;s Option once again. &#xA0;Even if his heart suddenly came to a stop, his heart would probably start back again if he saw the Item&apos;s Option.</span></p><p><span style="">This was how incredible the Item he possessed was.</span></p><p><span style="">Ahn-jaehyun once again let out a sigh admiration.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;It feels akin to buying a 1st place lotto ticket that I know will be a winner. &#xA0;This is really incredible.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">It was a level 150 Unique Item.</span></p><p><span style="">Moreover, this particular one was produced and circulated solely by the V&amp;V guild. They went as far to never selling it to the public. &#xA0;They dealt this Item only within their guild.</span></p><p><span style="">This was why one couldn&apos;t even put a fair market value of the set.</span></p><p><span style="">Ahn-jaehyun was well aware of this fact. &#xA0;Moreover, this fact brought Ahn-jaehyun&apos;s heart back to its normal rhythm.</span></p><p><span style="">The pounding died down. Ahn-jaehyun drank a sip of his coffee.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;It&apos;s a jackpot, but the problem is I can&apos;t sell it to anyone.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">As Ahn-jaehyun surmised, he couldn&apos;t sell the Greenstone Imoogi Helm to the public.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Wouldn&apos;t the V&amp;V guild try to fight me, while foaming at the mouth, when they realize I sold this piece?&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">When the helm appeared in the auction, the V&amp;V guild would immediately take action.</span></p><p><span style="">&apos;If you purchase the Imoogi helm, our guild will declare war on you as a service!&apos;</span></p><p><span style="">He was sure that was how the guild would react. &#xA0;As a customer, one would probably be too afraid of the V&amp;V guild to purchase this Item.</span></p><p><span style="">Moreover, if it was a full set, there might be a User, who might risk the danger of crossing the V&amp;V guild. &#xA0;However, he didn&apos;t have the full set, and the Greenstone Imoogi Helm could only show its true worth when it was in a set.</span></p><p><span style="">A single piece wasn&apos;t that popular.</span></p><p><span style="">This was why his potential customer was already predetermined.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;I have no choice, but to return it to its owner.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">He had no choice, but to sell it to its original owner.</span></p><p><span style="">The thought brought a smile to Ahn-jaehyun&apos;s lips. Ahn-jaehyun found the current situation to be quite humorous.</span></p><p><span style="">The thief was basically selling the goods back to the owner. &#xA0;It was most definitely a ridiculous situation.</span></p><p><span style="">This was a given, but when the owner receives the purchased Item, the owner will &#xA0;step forward to try to kill the thief. &#xA0;However, Anhn-jaehyun wasn&apos;t too worried about that part.</span></p><p><span style="">The bastard would have tried to kill Ahn-jaehyun even if this incident never happened.</span></p><p><span style="">He was going to fuck over the bastard one more time, so it made Ahn-jaehyun smile.</span></p><p><span style="">Also, from Ahn-jaehyun&apos;s perspective, the owner of the Item wasn&apos;t the one, who had attacked him. &#xA0;There was a possibility that Sinclair had been been gifted the Item or the Item had been loaned to him by the V&amp;V guild.</span></p><p><span style="">This was why Ahn-jaehyun thought a deal could be struck. &#xA0;Whether it was a present or a loan, the V&amp;V guild would want to recover something that had been lost. &#xA0;It would be tough to see the Item in the hands of another person. </span></p><p><span style="">The problem right now was the fact that he didn&apos;t know the identity of the person, who had ambushed him. &#xA0;Also, he didn&apos;t have any contacts within the V&amp;V guild. &#xA0;It wasn&apos;t as if he could just search out the V&amp;V guild then ask for a deal from them.</span></p><p><span style="">There was only one answer left.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;I&apos;ll contact the V&amp;V guild through the Red Bulls. It&apos;ll allow me to make some kind of bridge with them.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">He had to exploit a personal connection.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;I never expected the Red Bulls to be so helpful like this.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">Ahn-jaehyun felt that it had been worth the effort to develop this personal connection.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I heard you got spanked by the Hahoe Mask, Sinclair? &#xA0;How can you lose against a User, who is 30 levels below you? &#xA0;It doesn&apos;t make any sense.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">A woman wearing a robe made out of snake leather spoke. &#xA0;She spoke in a sarcastic manner, and it inevitably brought out a reaction from Sinclair. </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Shut up. The bastard ran away. I didn&apos;t lose.&#x201D; &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">It was a reasonable reaction&#x2026;&#x2026; He reacted in a temperamental manner.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I heard he stole your watch? &#xA0;That means you got spanked.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I got hoodwinked by the bastard. &#xA0;He didn&apos;t steal it from me.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Whatever. &#xA0;So which Item did you lose? &#xA0;Don&apos;t you usually fill all three slots?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">An answer came out from another source.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;He is wearing that armor, yet he doesn&apos;t have that idiotic helmet on his head. &#xA0;The answer can be easily deduced.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">When a stolen watch is re-issued to the User, everything was given back to the User except a single Item stored in each slot. Since he wasn&apos;t wearing his helmet, it meant the helmet had been taken from Sinclair&apos;s watch.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Is it perhaps the Greenstone Imoogi Helm? &#xA0;My god.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">The woman had been speaking playfully until now, but her expression became genuinely worried.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Of all the.... &#xA0;Didn&apos;t the V&amp;V guild loan that out to you?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">The woman&apos;s reaction made Sinclair&#x2019;s feelings fall off a deeper cliff. Sinclair gritted his teeth instead of answering. &#xA0;He didn&apos;t want to speak any further. He thought it was fortunate that he was inside a game. &#xA0;If this had been reality, his face would have been beet red as if it was about to explode.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Shit. &#xA0;That mother fucking Hahoe Mask.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">Naturally, Sinclair though about the Hahoe Mask, and he chewed on his lips.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Watchman Style? Son of a bitch.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">In truth, he was in a state of disbelief. &#xA0;He had fallen for a scam called the Watchman style. &#xA0;When he searched for the Watchman style online, it returned no result.</span></p><p><span style="">This might be a unique method developed to hoodwink a dumb User. &#xA0;Sinclair had probably been the first sacrificial lamb for this method.</span></p><p><span style="">It didn&apos;t matter how he spun it. &#xA0;This was a bad look for him.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;I&apos;ll kill him no matter what.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">The humiliation didn&apos;t end there. &#xA0;Sinclair was in a much fouler mood, because the much anticipated watch of Hyrkan only yielded a Normal Rank robe. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">Even if they weren&apos;t on a similar level, he had expected a level 120-130 Unique Item. &#xA0;It was known that the Hahoe Mask was always equipped with expensive Items.</span></p><p><span style="">Basically, he had stolen the Item of an owner, who owned a masterpiece. &#xA0;However, when one opened the wallet, the only thing inside was two 20 dollar bills and couple coins.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Hahoe Mask. &#xA0;I&apos;ll kill you every time I meet you in this game.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">Sinclair had to pay the penalty for losing the Greenstone Imoogi Helmet, and his organization was taking care of the aftermath.</span></p><p><span style="">First, he would have to have a conversation with the V&amp;V guild. &#xA0;Sinclair would have a clear idea where he stood only after he ended his talk with the V&amp;V guild. &#xA0;It was best to take all the beating in one sitting. &#xA0;It would be the worst if his punishment came consecutively in multiple parts.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Shit.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">Above all else, Sinclair had never experienced failure, so his pride had been hurt.</span></p><p><span style="">His organization contacted him at that moment.</span></p><p><span style="">- The Greenstone Imoogi helm that was stolen by the Hahoe Mask was recovered by the V&amp;V guild. For awhile, Sinclair is in charge of any business related to the V&amp;V guild. &#xA0;During that time, Sinclair is going to act as a member of the V&amp;V guild. &#xA0;Try your best to think of this as a volunteer service, Sinclair.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Sinclair planted the sword of revenge inside his heart.</span></p><p><span style="">After the Corrupt Count Raid, the Red Bulls and Stormhunters maintained a close and friendly relationship.</span></p><p><span style="">Of course, this relationship was unofficial. &#xA0;They were two of the top guilds fighting for the top spot within the 30 great guilds. &#xA0;If their friendly relationship was made official, the other guilds would become alarmed, and they would act accordingly.</span></p><p><span style="">Since this close and friendly unofficial relationship had to be maintained, the existence of a hotline was needed.</span></p><p><span style="">The Storm Queen and the Matador had established a hotline where they could contact each other unilaterally.</span></p><p><span style="">It sounded pretty good saying it like thatl, but it basically meant the two of them knew each other&apos;s phone number.</span></p><p><span style="">Currently, Che-sulyun was calling Chev. &#xA0;As she was calling him, Che-sulyun&apos;s face was covered with some unknown face pack.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Chev.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">- I&apos;m in a Raid right now. &#xA0;If you want to talk to me, you&apos;ll have to keep it short.</span></p><p><span style="">Chev was the recipient of the call, and he was in a tense situation. He had picked up the phone during a battle. &#xA0;Of course, Chev would be in a foul mood.</span></p><p><span style="">Of course, Che-sulyun wasn&apos;t someone, who cared about Chev&apos;s mood.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I heard a transaction was made between the Hahoe Mask and the V&amp;V guild. &#xA0;I acquired information that the Red Bulls acted as an intermediary.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Che-sulyun&apos;s voice was calm, and her expression didn&apos;t change. &#xA0;This was the effect of the face pack. If she got angry or frowned, the pack would be rendered useless.</span></p><p><span style="">Of course, Chev didn&apos;t know about this, so he was a bit surprised at her reaction. &#xA0;He asked her a question.</span></p><p><span style="">- Your intelligence capabilities is impressive. &#xA0;I never realized it was at such a level.</span></p><p><span style="">In truth, Chev had expected a call from Che-sulyun. &#xA0;One of the main sponsors of the V&amp;V guild was run by Che-sulyun&apos;s family. &#xA0;&#xA0;A deal had been conducted between the V&amp;V guild and the Hahoe Mask. &#xA0;Of course, she would hear about it. It would have been more suspicious, if she hadn&apos;t heard about it.</span></p><p><span style="">When Chev received a call from Che-sulyun, he had expected her to yell at him with a thunderous voice. Unlike how she looked, she was incredibly terrifying.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I thought I made myself clear last time.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Of course, Che-sulyun had called to give a warning.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;The Hahoe Mask is ours. &#xA0;Don&apos;t touch him.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Chev smirked at the warning.</span></p><p><span style="">- I didn&apos;t touch him. He&apos;s the one, who suggested the deal. &#xA0;Since I&apos;ve had couple dealings with him, he wanted me to put down a bridge for him.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;You are lucky I have my pack on. &#xA0;If we were holding this conversation inside the game, I would have already killed you.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Face pack.</span></p><p><span style="">Chev finally realized the reason why Che-sulyun was speaking so calmly.</span></p><p><span style="">- I guess I am very lucky that you have your pack on. Which part of your sentence should I reply to?</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Give me all the information you have on the Hahoe Mask.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Her voice was still calm.</span></p><p><span style="">However, Chev had a feeling that her calmness had reached its limit.</span></p><p><span style="">He wasn&apos;t going to mince his words.</span></p><p><span style="">- I&apos;ll put this out in no uncertain terms. I won&apos;t lie. I have great interest in the Hahoe Mask, and I want him on my team. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hmmm.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">- If this results in my guild warring with the Stormhunter guild, I&apos;m willing to put up with it. &#xA0;I want the Hahoe Mask to enter into my team.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Is that so?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">- However, even after such a resolve, I wasn&apos;t able to recruit the Hahoe Mask. &#xA0;You may glean what you may from my answer.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hand over the info.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">- I have no information regarding the Hahoe Mask. I just have a route I can use to make a deal with him. The trade route I am talking about is the Information Merchant, who revealed the identity of the Corrupt Count.</span></p><p><span style="">Che-sulyun&apos;s brows twitched at his words. &#xA0;A very small wrinkle formed on her pack.</span></p><p><span style="">- That is all the information I can give you. &#xA0;You should consider it a present . &#xA0;The fact that I&apos;m even telling you this much is, because I&apos;m taking into account our relationship. Red Bulls are in a cooperative relationship with the Stormhunters. &#xA0;We aren&apos;t in a master and servant relationship.</span></p><p><span style="">Che-sulyun didn&apos;t give an answer. &#xA0;Chev was waiting for her to answer, but words weren&apos;t coming easily to her.</span></p><p><span style="">In the end, Chev continued to speak.</span></p><p><span style="">- I&#x2019;m not speaking as the guild master right now. I&apos;ll give you some personal advice. &#xA0;Hahoe Mask only does deals. &#xA0;He gives only as much as he receives. &#xA0;If you really want a closer relationship with the Hahoe Mask, you should try getting him in your debt.</span></p><p><span style="">Che-sulyun still hadn&apos;t answered him.</span></p><p><span style="">- If needed, I can act as an intermediary. I plan on contacting the Hahoe Mask soon. &#xA0;Are you still on the phone? &#xA0;There&apos;s no answer. &#xA0;Huh? &#xA0;Did the call get cut off?</span></p><p><span style="">Che-sulyun was finally able to open her mouth. &#xA0;She had a big frown on her face.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Are you telling me to become his Daddy Long Legs?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">It seemed she would have to buy a new pack.</span></p>
