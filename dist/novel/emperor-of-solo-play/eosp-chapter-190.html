<p>Chapter 190 &#x2013; Emperor of Solo Play</p><p><span style="">1.</span></p><p><span style="">In historic events, there are times when an inexplicable gap in the story occurs. &#xA0;&#xA0;There was a sense that something had gone on, but no one knows the details. &#xA0;&#xA0;It is never recorded, and the people, who participated in these events, carry the information to their graves. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">The conversation that was about to start right now happened within this gap.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I&#x2019;m sorry, but your conversation partner will suddenly shift from a beauty to a man. As you probably know, our Queen really likes you. &#xA0;This is why she always took on deals that were harmful to us when dealing with you. This is why I feel obliged to step forward.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Hatch spoke as he looked at the User in front of him.</span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan was wearing a Hahoe Mask, and he wore a yellow robe, which was reminiscent of a flash of thunder.</span></p><p><span style="">Hatch felt as if he was staring at a monster.</span></p><p><span style="">&apos;I never expected him to get this far.&apos;</span></p><p><span style="">No, he really was a monster. &#xA0;He used his own power to put the Barbarian King to sleep. &#xA0;He made the impossible into reality. &#xA0;He succeeded in a task that one would have a hard time believing it happened even if one saw it.</span></p><p><span style="">&apos;Either we can ally with him or we can crush him. &#xA0;If not, the Hahoe Mask&#x2026; &#xA0;There are no other choice left for him.&apos;</span></p><p><span style="">Hatch calmed his emotions in front of the monster. &#xA0;He forced himself to smile as he spoke.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Since we serve the same teacher, let&#x2019;s de-escalate this situation. &#xA0;Aren&#x2019;t you also a student of Ahimbree? &#xA0;If we consider the order in which we became students, I am your senior. &#xA0;Of course, I&#x2019;m not asking you to treat me like a senior...&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">He was trying his best to de-escalate the tense atmosphere, yet it had no effect.</span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan didn&#x2019;t respond.</span></p><p><span style="">In truth, this wasn&#x2019;t the place for idle chatter. &#xA0;This meeting was put together to give an explanation.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;&#x2026;&#x2026;I&#x2019;m sorry. &#xA0;I&#x2019;ll immediately give you an explanation. &#xA0;I&#x2019;ll tell you about the meaning behind the Queen&#x2019;s proposal.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Hoo-ooh.</span></p><p><span style="">Hatch took in deep breaths as he organized his words inside his head.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Normally, the people making the game wants the people playing the game to like playing their game. &#xA0;This might be a lengthy explanation&#x2026; &#xA0;Please be patient. &#xA0;We still have a lot of time left.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">The atmosphere settled after Hatch spoke his words. &#xA0;It was akin to an exhale.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Anyways, the people, who make games for a living, have a hard time enjoying their own game. &#xA0;You know how it is, right? &#xA0;If you make something yourself, you only see the flaws. &#xA0;You also know which part is fun, and you know how to clear everything&#x2026; &#xA0;&#xA0;Moreover, if you run into difficulty, you have cheats built-in for convenience. &#xA0;This naturally led to the game developers to think about wanting to play a game full of mystery. &#xA0;Even if the content obvious, they wanted to play a game where they didn&#x2019;t know the content.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">For a brief moment, he was lost in his old memories. &#xA0;However, he quickly stopped his reminiscence.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;This was how Warlord was born. &#xA0;Of course, it was made using an AI in an attempt to decrease the personnel expenditure. &#xA0;This was why investment after investment was sunk into it&#x2026;. &#xA0;The creators of Warlord made it with such thoughts in mind. &#xA0;This was also why Warlord was able to differentiate itself from other similar games. &#xA0;It became the special one.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan still didn&#x2019;t respond.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Let me expand on my explanation. &#xA0;In the distant past, the world&#x2019;s best Go players played Go against an AI. &#xA0;&#xA0;At the time, people, who didn&#x2019;t even know how to play Go, were excited over the match. &#xA0;This is an analogous situation. &#xA0;&#xA0;The AI is an unknown variable. &#xA0;It is also a match between AI and humanity. &#xA0;A victorious outcome would prove the worthiness of humanity. &#xA0;Warlord was made using the same premise. &#xA0;From one to ten, the AI would create and be in charge of everything! &#xA0;This would stoke the interest of the people, who usually didn&#x2019;t play games. They unhesitatingly invested money into creating this criteria, which would drive the interest of the masses. &#xA0;In other words, if this criteria was lost, Warlord loses its worth. &#xA0;Moreover, we aren&#x2019;t at a point in our AI technology &#xA0;where an AI can manage Warlord indefinitely.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">At this point, Hatch no longer cared how Hyrkan reacted. </span></p><p><span style="">&quot;The world made by Warlord is about to come to an end. &#xA0;This is the last Main Scenario Quest. &#xA0;The only thing left after killing the Barbarian King is to acquire the artifact of the War King to fight the Dragon. &#xA0;After the battle with the Dragon, this game will become a normal game.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;So what?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">For the first time, Hyrkan reacted. &#xA0;Hatch couldn&#x2019;t help, but laugh at his reaction.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Once Warlord becomes a normal game, you won&#x2019;t be able to accrue the same amount of fame and wealth. &#xA0;You won&#x2019;t be able to earn several hundred thousand dollars just from posting a single hunting video. &#xA0;No company in this world would pay you exorbitant amount of money to sponsor you. &#xA0;Of course, you&apos;ll be able to make money. &#xA0;However, it wouldn&#x2019;t be at the current level. &#xA0;In other words, if you monkey around with the current situation, you&#x2019;ll be able to earn more fame and money over a longer period of time. &#xA0;If you can play this game for one more year, you&#x2019;ll even be able to own a building worth several millions of dollars. &#xA0;This is why I&#x2019;m going to ask you these questions. &#xA0;Will you be able to kill this game knowing this? &#xA0;Are you willing to give up everything in the process?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">At his words, Hyrkan thought over the words that had been spoken.</span></p><p><span style="">Shir spoke.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;This is my last proposal.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">It was her last proposal.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;You can either finish this game with me, or you can go to war with me.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">He could share the glory of ending Warlord with her or he could extend the life-cycle of Warlord by fighting against her.</span></p><p><span style="">He had to choose one of those options.</span></p><p><span style="">After she put forth her short proposal, Hatch stepped forward to block off Shir. &#xA0;Shir&#x2019;s proposal was abrupt, and Hatch had to interpret and explain her words.</span></p><p><span style="">Thanks to his efforts, Hyrkan was able to understand everything.</span></p><p><span style="">He now knew what was going on around him.</span></p><p><span style="">He now understood what was going on in this world called Warlord.</span></p><p><span style="">Moreover, he had an idea on what he should do from now on.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Were you perhaps a programmer?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">At Hyrkan&#x2019;s question, Hatch nodded his head.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Yes, it was my past occupation.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Did you participate in creating Warlord?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I wasn&#x2019;t directly involved. &#xA0;If Warlord was a person, I pretty much made the pinky toe.&quot; </span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Before I give you guys an answer, I&#x2019;ll say couple things.&quot; </span></p><p><span style="">Hatch nodded his head in agreement.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;First, I&#x2019;ll complete this game. &#xA0;I&#x2019;ll do it even if you guys interfere with me. &#xA0;Even if all of the 30 great guilds interfere with me, I&#x2019;m going to end this game.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">As if Hatch understood Hyrkan&#x2019;s position, he nodded his head.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Moreover, I&#x2019;m not afraid of starting a war with the Stormhunters. &#xA0;I&#x2019;m not saying this as a bluff. &#xA0;I&#x2019;m telling the truth. &#xA0;I don&#x2019;t care if I win or lose. &#xA0;If the Stormhunters guild starts a war with me, I won&#x2019;t avoid it. &#xA0;In other words, even if I do pick one of the two options, I&#x2019;m not making it out of fear of the Stormhunters.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Ha ha&#x2026;&#x2026;&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Hatch let out a short laugh. &#xA0;At his laugh, Hyrkan laughed. There were many emotions mixed in with that laugh.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Lastly, I will never wear that in this game.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;What?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Hatch stopped his laughter in surprise. &#xA0;Hyrkan was pointing at his chest.</span></p><p><span style="">It was the emblem of the Stormhunters.</span></p><p><span style="">At that moment, Hatch was curious to hear his answer, so he asked Hyrkan a question.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Why do you keep refusing to join our guild? &#xA0;&#xA0;In truth, it isn&#x2019;t as if we are treating you badly. &#xA0;If how I was treated was used as a baseline, you were&#x2026;.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">At Hatch&#x2019;s objection, Hyrkan put his index finger over his lips to shush him.</span></p><p><span style="">Hatch closed his mouth.</span></p><p><span style="">When silence descended, Hyrkan opened his mouth.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I&#x2019;ll turn down the proposal. &#xA0;However, I&#x2019;m willing to make a deal.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">2.</span></p><p><span style="">The gap ended, and history once again moved along.</span></p><p><span style="">[Barbarian King Nesha was sealed.]</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Uh?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Really?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">The Users crowding the Bizma Plain, and all the Users connected to the game heard the Announcement. </span></p><p><span style="">The news was immediately spread outside. &#xA0;It was the version of the story with a gap in it.</span></p><p><span style="">All the people ranging from having little to do with Warlord to the ones where the game took center in their lives became aware of the news.</span></p><p><span style="">-My god.</span></p><p><span style="">-Wow.</span></p><p><span style="">-The Hahoe Mask really&#x2026;.</span></p><p><span style="">He had done it.</span></p><p><span style="">Hahoe Mask.</span></p><p><span style="">He made the impossible possible, and he turned despair into hope. &#xA0;He turned a nightmare into a dream of good omen. &#xA0;Hyrkan turned himself into a legend.</span></p><p><span style="">3.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Hyrkan!&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Whistling ran towards Hyrkan. &#xA0;He looked as if he wanted to squeeze Hyrkan to death with a hug.</span></p><p><span style="">However, Hyrkan was firm with his words when he saw Whistling running towards him.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;If you attempt to hug or kiss me, I&#x2019;m going to kill you.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Duhp-suhk!</span></p><p><span style="">Whistling ignored Hyrkan&#x2019;s words, and he hugged Hyrkan. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan let out a yell.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Hey!&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Thank you.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">After saying those words, Whistling hugged him harder. &#xA0;If this was happening in real life instead of the game, Whistling&#x2019;s tears would have made Hyrkan&#x2019;s shoulder wet.</span></p><p><span style="">This was how much gratitude Whistling felt towards Hyrkan.</span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan pried Whistling off of him. &#xA0;Hyrkan&#x2019;s Strength stat was much higher, so he was able to easily escape from Whistling&#x2019;s hug.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;All right. &#xA0;Let&#x2019;s get ready to end this. &#xA0;Of course, since I caught it by myself, all the loot is mine.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Even at that moment, Hyrkan was making calculations. &#xA0;Whistling couldn&#x2019;t help, but laugh at this. &#xA0;Whistling knew this was Hyrkan&#x2019;s attempt at cheering him &#xA0;up. &#xA0;This had started out as a festival, and he wanted it to remain a festival. &#xA0;This was why Whistling didn&#x2019;t say any more unnecessary words. &#xA0;He didn&#x2019;t say thank you, sorry or great work to him.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;All right. &#xA0;You take everything. &#xA0;You should eat it all!&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">He agreed enthusiastically with Hyrkan.</span></p><p><span style="">At that moment, he was being cordial, but many thoughts crowded Hyrkan&#x2019;s head.</span></p><p><span style="">&apos;I never expected First One to be a program&#x2026;.&apos;</span></p><p><span style="">He had made a deal with the Stormhunters guild.</span></p><p><span style="">The Stormhunters guild carried out their part of the deal by telling Hyrkan how he could reach the end of this game.</span></p><p><span style="">One of the requirement was for Hyrkan to jump past the level of First One Sulwoo.</span></p><p><span style="">Hatch gave an explanation.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;First One Sulwoo is a program. &#xA0;In the first place, it is impossible for a person to play the game like the First One. &#xA0;&#xA0;The First One&#x2019;s role is to manage Warlord, and it is a M.I. that plans out the content. &#xA0;It measure the level difference between Users and the First One. &#xA0;It is a measuring stick of how far the game had progressed. &#xA0;&#xA0;Depending on how much distance the front-runners close with the First One, it controls the speed of progress in the game.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan was baffled when he heard the explanation. &#xA0;However, it did explain why not much content was being made by First One Sulwoo compared to its fame and profile. &#xA0;The K media company created the videos, and this was why most of its hunting video was in diary format. &#xA0;This was also the reason why there was no footage of First One Sulwoo conducting a raid..</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;That really screws with the User in the number 2 Rank. &#xA0;I would have sued Tobot Soft if I was second in the Level Ranking.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">At the same time, he felt sorry for the Users, who sacrificed their lives, to catch First One&#x2019;s level.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What can we do about it? &#xA0;In the first place, Warlord was a game made to test the AI. &#xA0;They didn&#x2019;t plan for all of this, and they deserve to be sued. &#xA0;Anyways, let&#x2019;s get back to the main topic. If you pass the First One, you&#x2019;ll be taking away the pencil and eraser used by the M.I. It would no longer be able to solve problems in managing Warlord. &#xA0;Of course, this forces the M.I. to wrap everything up. &#xA0;It basically puts forth the final boss into this world.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">He had to catch up to the First One.</span></p><p><span style="">This was how he reached the epilogue. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">Moreover, Hyrkan planned on doing just that.</span></p><p><span style="">If he wanted to do this, he had to kill the Barbarian King. &#xA0;Moreover, he needed the Chronicle Unique Item dropped by the Barbarian King.</span></p><p><span style="">&apos;I&#x2019;ll catch up to it immediately.&apos;</span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan didn&#x2019;t plan on wilting down the home stretch.</span></p><p><span style="">He would burn bright until the end. &#xA0;He&#x2019;ll be a torch and a symbol that will decorate the end.</span></p><p><span style="">On top of that, he planned on becoming the true emperor.</span></p><p><span style="">&apos;Emperor of Solo Play. &#xA0;That sounds awesome.&apos;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;No matter how I look at, this we are taking a loss on this deal.&quot; </span></p><p><span style="">They had left the Bizma Plain, and they were heading towards the Heard Fortress Ruin. &#xA0;After struggling with his thoughts, Hatch finally opened his mouth.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Queen. &#xA0;This really is a preposterous deal. &#xA0;Why did we purchase the Red Bulls? &#xA0;Why did we ally with the Hydra guild? &#xA0;Didn&#x2019;t we do it, so we could put the name of the Stormhunters in the end credits?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">At his words, Shir didn&#x2019;t say anything. &#xA0;Instead of an answer, one corner of her mouth kept twitching.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Yet you are going to allow the Hahoe Mask to catch the Dragon by himself? &#xA0;Moreover, we are going to give him our full support? &#xA0;&#xA0;Why are we acting in this retarded manner? &#xA0;We did all the hard work, yet we are giving everything to the Hahoe Mask on a silver platter! &#xA0;It isn&#x2019;t as if the Hahoe Mask is fighting as a member of the Stormhunters guild!&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Hatch shook his head from side to side. &#xA0;He realized his words were having no effect on Shir, so he immediately changed the target of his anger.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;How can the Hahoe Mask be so confident? &#xA0;He doesn&#x2019;t even know what the final boss is, yet he wants to face it alone? &#xA0;Does he realize how kind of opponent a Dragon is? &#xA0;That bastard is weird. &#xA0;I&#x2019;m pretty sure he has around half a dozen screws loose inside his head.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;If the Hahoe Mask fails, it&#x2019;ll be our turn. &#xA0;I don&#x2019;t see the downside.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Chev, who had been silently listening to Hatch&#x2019;s rant, gave his opinion.</span></p><p><span style="">Hatch couldn&#x2019;t help, but laugh at his words.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Ah, is that so? &#xA0;Is that why you just gave Argardo to the Hahoe Mask?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;That&#x2019;s&#x2026;&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;This is the Hahoe Mask&#x2019;s strategy. &#xA0;He tells others to catch it if he fails. &#xA0;However, that guy never fails. &#xA0;It was the same in the Anugas Raid. &#xA0;If the Hahoe Mask failed in the Anugas Raid, we would have been next. &#xA0;However, the Hahoe Mask killed Anugas.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Chev let out a bitter laugh.</span></p><p><span style="">At that moment, Shir&#x2019;s twitching mouth opened.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;If the Hahoe Mask fails, the Dragon is ours.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;That&#x2019;s.....&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;On the other hand, if the Hahoe Mask succeeds, he is mine.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Hatch was about to mutter something, but he gave up on it. &#xA0;He knew better than anyone.</span></p><p><span style="">&apos;Shit. The Queen is totally head over heels for the Hahoe Mask.&apos;</span></p><p><span style="">Hahoe Mask had given a counter-proposal.</span></p><p><span style="">He would kill the Dragon on his own.</span></p><p><span style="">Moreover, if they helped him, he would put on the name of the Stormhunters in a different game.</span></p><p><span style="">&apos;Uh-whew. &#xA0;This guild has no one, who is of sound mind. &#xA0;They are all crazy. &#xA0;Now the craziest one of them all will be joining us. &#xA0;Words don&#x2019;t even work on him.&apos;</span></p><p><span style="">Hatch thought about the Hahoe Mask, who would become his comrade at the conclusion of Warlord. &#xA0;He let out a sigh.</span></p>
