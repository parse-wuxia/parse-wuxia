<p>Chapter 185 &#x2013; Barbarian King (2)</p><p>4.</p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I&#x2019;m sorry. &#xA0;We can&#x2019;t abandon the forest. &#xA0;We can&#x2019;t run away.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">The voice was light, and it was filled with sorrow. &#xA0;Still, the voice was very beautiful, and it tickled one&#x2019;s ears. &#xA0;A man, who looked like a fighting dog, silently looked at the character, who spoke. &#xA0;&#xA0;He gritted his teeth.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Whistling hyung-nim! &#xA0;It is almost right in front of our noses!&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Whistling oppa! &#xA0;It would be best if we leave right now!&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">A man and a woman yelled to the rough looking man from afar.</span></p><p><span style="">Yojori and Joba were comrades of Whistling, but they had also become his dongsaengs. &#xA0;However, he didn&#x2019;t answer them.</span></p><p><span style="">He looked at a pointy eared elf with pink short hair. &#xA0;She had on a hairpin made out of cherry blossoms clipped to her hair.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Please go.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">The Elf let out a bright smile towards Whistling, and she lightly put her hands on his chest.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;We won&#x2019;t forget the effort you exerted for us. &#xA0;We&#x2019;ll even imprint your story in the Record Fruit. When the Record Seed sprouts and grows, it will remember you. &#xA0;It&#x2019;ll will be seen by our descendents.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">The Elf, who had put her hand on Whistling&#x2019;s chest, turned, and she started to run towards an unknown destination. &#xA0;It wasn&#x2019;t just a single Elf. &#xA0;&#xA0;Numerous Elves, who looked similar to a pink colored buds of a cherry blossom, was running through the forest.</span></p><p><span style="">[You have acquired the title &#x2018;The Great Benefactor of the Elves&#x2019;.] </span></p><p><span style="">[You have acquired the title &#x2018;One who received the Blessing of the Elves&#x2019;.] </span></p><p><span style="">[The effect of the title, &#x2018;One who received the Blessing of the Elves&#x2019;, will allow your movement speed to increase by 10% at locations where trees are present.] </span></p><p><span style="">Even during such a ruckus, Whistling heard the System Announcement regarding the acquisition of his Titles. </span></p><p><span style="">The Announcement would have given goosebumps to most Users. &#xA0;This might be one of handful of Titles coveted the most in terms of worth. &#xA0;The eyes of most Users would have flipped around from jealousy. &#xA0;It was a valuable Title. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">However, the value of the Title didn&#x2019;t register in Whistling&#x2019;s ears or eyes.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Shit.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">They were at a half-moon shaped lake located in the southeast region of the Black Continent. &#xA0;It was called the Ohokal.</span></p><p><span style="">The lake was a stage with a forest filled with cherry blossom trees next to it. &#xA0;The region was always fragrant, and it always gave off a fresh feeling.</span></p><p><span style="">The Simia tribe was an Elven tribe, who decided to reside in this region. &#xA0;They wore outfits that went very well with their surrounding. &#xA0;The Elves of the Simia tribe always had on accessories that reminded one of a cherry blossom.</span></p><p><span style="">On the surface, this region looked very beautiful, but it was crawling with monsters over Level 220.</span></p><p><span style="">However, even amongst such difficulties, the Simia tribe protected and maintained their way of life.</span></p><p><span style="">However, a being that the Elves wouldn&#x2019;t be able to win against was coming towards their lands.</span></p><p><span style="">Barbarian King! </span></p><p><span style="">The Stormhunters guild had awakened this monster about a month ago, and it was roaming around the Black Continent. &#xA0;Every region it passed through turned into hell.</span></p><p><span style="">At that moment, the Barbarian King had brought several thousand monsters, and they were getting ready to cross the Ohokal Lake.</span></p><p><span style="">However, the Simia tribe decided to fight back against the Barbarian King. &#xA0;They decided to mount a defense for their land by the lake.</span></p><p><span style="">They would meet their end here.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hyung-nim!&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Oppa!&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">They&#x2019;ll fall.</span></p><p><span style="">At that moment, Whistling didn&#x2019;t want to make such guarantees, but the Simia tribe wouldn&#x2019;t be able to defend their land from the Barbarian King. &#xA0;</span><span style="">The System called Warlord wouldn&#x2019;t allow it.</span></p><p><span style="">The Warlord&#x2019;s System would only allow Users to defeat the Barbarian King.</span></p><p><span style="">This truth was revealed by the Steel Lion Knights, who crossed the Urugal mountain range. &#xA0;They cut through the wall of Level 240 monsters like butter to reach the Barbarian King, but they were crushed in a horrible manner. &#xA0;The Barbarian King hadn&#x2019;t received even a scratch in the fight, and it gave credence to this truth.</span></p><p><span style="">This was a game.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Shit!&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">However, Whistling couldn&#x2019;t accept the excuse that this was merely a game. &#xA0;He wouldn&#x2019;t take this situation lying down.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yojori! &#xA0;Joba! &#xA0;You guys get out of here!&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I&#x2019;ll fight here. &#xA0;I&#x2019;ll stop the Barbarian King here.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">After hearing his words, Yojori and Joba had the same expression on their faces. &#xA0;They were dumbfounded.</span></p><p><span style="">Whistling wanted to stop the Barbarian King?</span></p><p><span style="">There had already been many attempts to pull off such a feat. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">Numerous Raid teams were formed for the purpose of killing the Barbarian King. &#xA0;These were raid attempts with a good deal of preparation and forethought behind it.</span></p><p><span style="">All of them failed miserably.</span></p><p><span style="">The reason why the Barbarian King was coming to this place was the fact that all previous Raid Teams had failed.</span></p><p><span style="">Yet he wanted to stop the Barbarian King?</span></p><p><span style="">This was an absolutely absurd statement.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ok. &#xA0;Let&#x2019;s do this.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;The worst that can happen is a Game Over. &#xA0;Let us fight together. &#xA0;Anyways, our Quest is gone, because of the Barbarian King.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;The act of walking back to the Heard Fortress ruin town will be arduous. &#xA0;Let&#x2019;s just die and get sent there at once.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;We can&#x2019;t turn back now. &#xA0;We have to try something. &#xA0;Absolutely!&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">However, Yojori and Joba had already evaluated the situation that&#x2019;ll unfold soon. &#xA0;Their faces relaxed, and they put on bright expressions.</span></p><p><span style="">Whistling gritted his teeth at their words. &#xA0;The two of them were choosing to suffer through a Game Over for him. &#xA0;He was thankful, and he was sorry. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">However, at that moment, Whistling didn&#x2019;t express those two feelings.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;All right. &#xA0;Let us become heroes for once.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">They would show their will. &#xA0;Their will was inelegant and worthless, but they would express their will.</span></p><p><span style="">However, there was no way they would become heroes.</span></p><p>5.</p><p><span style="">[You Level has increased.] </span></p><p><span style="">[Bone Dragon Skill Rank has increased to Rank C.] </span></p><p><span style="">[Iron Golem Skill Rank has increased to Rank C.] </span></p><p><span style="">[Death Knight Skill Rank has increased to Rank B.] </span></p><p><span style="">[Skeleton Exhibition Skill Rank has increased to Rank D.] </span></p><p><span style="">[You&#x2019;ve acquired the Title &#x2018;Slaughterer of the Tattoo Scorpions&#x2019;.] </span></p><p><span style="">There were so many consecutive System Announcement that it was almost tiring to hear it.</span></p><p><span style="">Each accumulation of these Announcements was good news, but Hyrkan&#x2019;s ears didn&#x2019;t pay attention to the sound.</span></p><p><span style="">He raised his head, and he looked at the monster he was stepping on.</span></p><p><span style="">His foot was on the Tattoo Scorpion&#x2019;s tail. &#xA0;It was a 7 meters long monster with tattoos all over its body.</span></p><p><span style="">Doohk ddoohk! </span></p><p><span style="">Big drops of poison was falling from the tip of the Tattoo Scorpion&#x2019;s tail. &#xA0;It was the size of a man&#x2019;s head. </span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan&#x2019;s HP slowly fell as the poison dripped. &#xA0;Hrykan bit down on the red candy inside his mouth. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">Accompanying a taste akin to a spicy garlic, his HP started to rise.</span></p><p><span style="">Since he had a time for a breather, Hyrkan looked at his defensive set. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">It wasn&#x2019;t invincible, but the spotted armor had more defense than any other defensive set in Warlord. &#xA0;However, the Dark Spot set had holes in various locations right now, and the holes were the size of the stinger on the Tattoo Scorpion&#x2019;s tail.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;It is time for me to change it.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">Dark Spot set.</span></p><p><span style="">He had used it for a very long time, and it was finally time to say goodbye to this Item.</span></p><p><span style="">It was a late goodbye. &#xA0;Even if it was a very good Item, it was only a level 180 set, yet it was being used in a level 260 hunting ground. &#xA0;If one expected one to be fine using such an Item here, one would be expecting too much. </span></p><p><span style="">This was also the reason why he was killing the Tattoo Scorpions.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Well, I&#x2019;ll have to use this opportunity to switch out everything.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">Tattoo Scorpion.</span></p><p><span style="">It was a mid-sized Level 260 Monster. &#xA0;When one went deeper into the Red Desert, one would arrive at the Red Wasteland. &#xA0;One could encounter this monster there, and it was the highest Level monster encountered by Users in Warlord as of now. &#xA0;Moreover, it had the best Option amongst Rare Rank Items that could be crafted from normal monsters over Level 240.</span></p><p><span style="">The best feature activated when one wore all 5 parts. &#xA0;The effect of the Tattoo Scorpion&#x2019;s Tattoo Pattern was quite good.</span></p><p><span style="">When one attacked, it could impose a Poison Status on one&#x2019;s opponent. &#xA0;Moreover, the poison was quite powerful.</span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan decided to use this opportunity to equip all his Skeletons with the Tattoo Scorpion Set.</span></p><p><span style="">It had been about a month, since the Barbarian King had appeared, and this was why Hyrkan had stuck to hunting only the Tattoo Scorpions.</span></p><p><span style="">Now he was reaping the benefit of staying in this location for a month.</span></p><p><span style="">He had reached Level 253.</span></p><p><span style="">One could find Hyrkan&#x2019;s name in the Level Rankings now. &#xA0;There was only a 12 level gap between him and the First One.</span></p><p><span style="">Moreover, he had gathered a lot of Items. &#xA0;He had obtained enough Items to equip 30 Skeletons with a full set. &#xA0;Thirty sounded small, but each set had five parts. &#xA0;Basically, he had acquired 150 Rare Items. &#xA0;&#xA0;Normal Users wouldn&#x2019;t even be able to imagine the process involved in killing so many Tattoo Scorpions.</span></p><p><span style="">This was why Hyrkan was able to earn a profit through the footage. &#xA0;Hyrkan poured his money into this hunt.</span></p><p><span style="">He wasn&#x2019;t as rich as the old Rich Lich, but it wasn&#x2019;t an exaggeration to say that Hyrkan was spending as much as him.</span></p><p><span style="">Despite this fact, Hyrkan&#x2019;s account was in the surplus. &#xA0;Even as he went nuts in spending his money, there was always money left in Hyrkan&#x2019;s Wallet.</span></p><p><span style="">This was the best.</span></p><p><span style="">His incredible Level Up pace had him in spitting distance to First One, who was 1st in the rankings. &#xA0;His free-handed investments allowed him to quickly raise the Skill Ranks, and he had &#xA0;acquired Level 250 Rare Items by killing powerful monsters. &#xA0;All of this process was being consumed by voracious viewers. &#xA0;His viewers didn&#x2019;t hesitate to pay for his content. &#xA0;They wanted to see everything he did.</span></p><p><span style="">While he was doing all of this, the Black Continent was slowly descending into hell thanks to the efforts of the Barbarian King. &#xA0;All of Hahoe Mask&#x2019;s competitors were being killed under the tyrannical rule of the Barbarian King. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">Hahoe Mask was leaving everyone in the dust.</span></p><p><span style="">This situation was unbelievably great for him.</span></p><p><span style="">When he realized he had returned to the past, he had been really glad that he would be able to play this game again. &#xA0;At the time, he could have never imagined that he would reach such an optimal situation, yet Hyrkan had climbed to the top.</span></p><p><span style="">So why was he feeling this way? </span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;&#xB7;&#xB7;&#xB7;&#xB7;&#xB7;&#xB7;this is boring.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">A yawn came out of his mouth.</span></p><p><span style="">He had achieved the goal he had always pined for. &#xA0;Riches and fame was within his grasp, and it wouldn&#x2019;t be an exaggeration to say he was the best in this game. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">However, the recent Tattoo Scorpion Hunt was the most boring period of time he had experienced since he started Warlord.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;I was never bored when I fought against the Stormhunters guild&#x2026;.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">This was a first.</span></p><p><span style="">While Hyrkan played Warlord, the game sometimes made him annoyed and angry. &#xA0;There were many instances where he swore at the game. &#xA0;However, he never thought that the game of Warlord was boring.</span></p><p><span style="">Even when he was warring with the Stormhunters guild, &#xA0;he cussed them out in anger. &#xA0;He was sick and tired of them. &#xA0;However, he never thought the game was boring.</span></p><p><span style="">When he killed five to six guild members of the Stormhunters guild, he felt joy. &#xA0;He felt happy when he broke through the tribulation in the style of the Hero Slaughterer. &#xA0;&#xA0;He had enjoyed Warlord in those moments.</span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan turned his head. &#xA0;His surrounding was filled Skeleton Warriors, who had been brilliant in their fight against the Tattoo Scorpions. &#xA0;The Skeleton Warriors were staring back at him. &#xA0;They were waiting for their master to give a new order.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Now that I think about it, they fight intelligently even without my training.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">He thought about a fond memory of his. In the beginning, he had ruthlessly pushed the Skeleton Warriors to train them. &#xA0;However, they no longer needed his training. &#xA0;The Skeleton&#x2019;s Combat AI was a finished product. &#xA0;It was splendid. &#xA0;The repeated training and battles allowed them to become extraordinary warriors. &#xA0;At the very least, they would be able to hold their own weight in any fight.</span></p><p><span style="">The Skeletons were better than most Users, and he had 100 Skeletons under his command. &#xA0;In the near future, he&#x2019;ll also use the Transcendent Ancient Power on the Death Knight when it became Rank A. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">Who&#x2019;ll be able to rival him at that point?</span></p><p><span style="">Royal Road! </span></p><p><span style="">The road of an emperor could be seen in front of him right now. &#xA0;If he followed this road, he&#x2019;ll surely become the best.</span></p><p><span style="">However, Hyrkan wasn&#x2019;t interested in what was waiting at the end of the road.</span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan lowered his head.</span></p><p><span style="">It was as if he was trying to avoid the gazes of his Skeleton Warriors.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#xB7;&#xB7;&#xB7;&#xB7;&#xB7;&#xB7;fuck.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">In the end, a swear word came out of his mouth.</span></p><p><span style="">The one to break his dull and boring day was a call from his friend.</span></p><p>6.</p><p><span style="">- I want to borrow your name, Hahoe Mask.</span></p><p><span style="">Whistling had contacted Hyrkan out of nowhere, and the request was quite sudden.</span></p><p><span style="">Before Hyrkan could reply to his request, Whistling quickly explained his situation. &#xA0;He sounded desperate as if he was being chased by something.</span></p><p><span style="">- You don&#x2019;t have to do anything. &#xA0;I know this is asking a lot from you. &#xA0;I just&#x2026;. &#xA0;&#xA0;I need your name. &#xA0;Please let me borrow your name.</span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan calmed him down before asking for an explanation. &#xA0;Afterwards, Whistling calmly explained the plan he came up with.</span></p><p><span style="">- I&#x2019;m planning on killing the Barbarian King. &#xA0;However, as you probably know, the 30 great guilds won&#x2019;t participate in the Barbarian King Raid. &#xA0;In the end, the regular Users have to be gathered to form a Raid Team&#x2026;. &#xA0;I plan on using the Hahoe Mask name to gather the normal Users. &#xA0;If it becomes known that you&#x2019;ll step forward forward for the Barbarian King raid, many Users will participate.</span></p><p><span style="">At the end, he gave his apologies.</span></p><p><span style="">- I know this request is a bit much. &#xA0;This is why if the Raid fails&#x2026;. &#xA0;I&#x2019;ll tell them I made it all up. &#xA0;I&#x2019;ll tell them I sold you out. &#xA0;Still, there might be some backlash towards you&#x2026;. &#xA0;&#xA0;I&#x2019;m asking for a favor. &#xA0;I can&#x2019;t leave the Barbarian King alone. &#xA0;Even if this is only a game, I can&#x2019;t just stand by and watch this unfold. &#xA0;I don&#x2019;t want to wait as I pray for the 30 great guilds to move.</span></p><p><span style="">Finally, the meat of the conversation started.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;So you want to kill the Barbarian King?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">- The Users are pretty much fed up. &#xA0;They are very unsatisfied with the Barbarian King. &#xA0;If it becomes known that you want to catch the Barbarian King, there are a lot of Users, who would want to help you. &#xA0;No, you don&#x2019;t have to do anything. &#xA0;I&#x2019;ll say this again. &#xA0;All I need is&#x2026;.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What clear method will you use to take down the Barbarian King? &#xA0;You have to destroy the Protection Gem at Phase 1. &#xA0;That wouldn&#x2019;t be too difficult. &#xA0;However, you don&#x2019;t have any method at your disposal that will allow you to damage it once it enters the 2nd phase called Storm Judgement Mode.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">- I researched the Main Scenario Quest, and I found a clue. &#xA0;Moreover&#x2026; &#xA0;The next attempt at the Barbarian King Raid would be the 31st attempt. &#xA0;I plan on using the clue as the basis for the next clear method.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What is that method?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">- The method is&#x2026;... </span></p><p><span style="">Whistling first told him about the clue he was able to find in the Main Scenario quest. &#xA0;Then he started explaining his clear method.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ooh-hahaha.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">As he listened to Whistling&#x2019;s words, laughter suddenly erupted from Hyrkan&#x2019;s mouth. &#xA0;The excessive amount of laughter indicated that Hyrkan was delighted. &#xA0;&#xA0;He was having a hard time stopping his laughter.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Sorry. &#xA0;Ah. &#xA0;I&#x2019;m really sorry.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan was barely able to suppress his laughter, and he gave his apology.</span></p><p><span style="">- Were you in the middle of something? &#xA0;If so, I&#x2019;ll call a bit later&#x2026;.</span></p><p><span style="">Whistling couldn&#x2019;t understand why Hyrkan gave an apology. &#xA0;He also couldn&#x2019;t comprehend Hyrkan&#x2019;s laughter.</span></p><p><span style="">All he could do was apologize.</span></p><p><span style="">Did he perhaps interrupt Hyrkan, when he was doing something very important?</span></p><p><span style="">When he had this thought, Whistling wanted to immediately end the call. &#xA0;He was too embarrassed about his own actions. &#xA0;He was trying to use his friend in such a manner.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;As expected, this suits my constitution.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan unburdened Whistling&#x2019;s heart.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes. &#xA0;The Hahoe Mask should do this. &#xA0;This isn&#x2019;t something a knock-off Hahoe Mask can do. &#xA0;This is something the real Hahoe Mask should take on.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">The game had been boring. &#xA0;For over a month, he plowed through the game as he yawned. &#xA0;This incident had suddenly made Hyrkan&#x2019;s heart beat faster.</span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan didn&#x2019;t want to avoid feeling such a thrill. &#xA0;No, palpitation of his heart was like the sound of an engine that was a must for Hyrkan when he played Warlord.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;You set it up. &#xA0;I&apos;ll go catch that bastard. &#xA0;I&#x2019;ll kill the Barbarian King.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">As he spoke, Hyrkan stood up. &#xA0;When he started to move, the Skeletons followed Hyrkan with their gazes.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ah. &#xA0;I&#x2019;ll catch the Barbarian King by myself. &#xA0;From what you have told me, it&#x2019;ll be more troublesome if there are too many Users there.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">- You want to do it alone, Hyrkan? Even if it is you, you won&apos;t be able to solo the Barbarian King...</span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan gave a command to his Skeletons.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I have t solo it. &#xA0;If not, I won&#x2019;t be able to eat all the benefits by myself. &#xA0;Of course, I&#x2019;m not by myself.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">He gave his instructions! &#xA0;His next target was the Barbarian King!</span></p><p>7.</p><p><span style="">Kooohng! </span></p><p><span style="">It was a giant.</span></p><p><span style="">It had massive legs that made one think about pillars. &#xA0;Its legs were massive, but its large body made its legs look puny. &#xA0;It was a giant with long and thick arms.</span></p><p><span style="">Koohng! </span></p><p><span style="">The giant was wearing a golden armor. &#xA0;The armor was very flashy, and the armor was decorated with numerous adornments. &#xA0;The ornaments that stood out the most were the gems of various colors. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">There were 31 gems and each of them were bigger than a person&#x2019;s head. &#xA0;They were so bright that they were radiant.</span></p><p><span style="">Koohng! </span></p><p><span style="">The most striking feature was the head of the giant. &#xA0;It had large fan-like ears like an elephant. &#xA0;It had a long nose and it also possessed ivory tusks. &#xA0;However, the gleam in its eyes wasn&#x2019;t like that of an elephant.</span></p><p><span style="">The sclera of the eye was black, and the pupil was yellow. &#xA0;It looked like the eyes of a dragon. &#xA0;No, it was probably Dragon Eyes.</span></p><p><span style="">Koohng! </span></p><p><span style="">The 7 meters tall giant wore golden armor. &#xA0;Moreover, it possessed Dragon Eyes and the head of an elephant. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">Every step it took caused the ground to shake.</span></p><p><span style="">It possessed enormous strength, and it possessed an incredible presence! </span></p><p><span style="">Its name was Nesha. </span></p><p><span style="">Barbarian King Nesha! </span></p><p><span style="">This being had carried out the Dragon&#x2019;s Judgement. &#xA0;It had made ruins of strong and prosperous Kingdoms, who had fought against the Dragon early on. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">It possessed the authority of the Dragon, and it was able to command any uncivilized beings, who were barbaric. &#xA0;It was able to command all beings, who lived by following their instincts.</span></p><p><span style="">The monsters stepped forward for the sake of building up the king&#x2019;s dignity.</span></p><p><span style="">The forest looked endless, but each step taken by the king eliminated the trees.</span></p><p><span style="">Shweek, shweek! </span></p><p><span style="">The monsters, who possessed sharp tools, were cutting down the trees.</span></p><p><span style="">Poo-hwaht! </span></p><p><span style="">Those with no weapons pulled the trees and boulders by its roots. &#xA0;A large road formed, and it was wide enough for the Barbarian King to walk on it.</span></p><p><span style="">Koohng!</span></p><p><span style="">The Barbarian King took the next step only when the path was clear.</span></p><p><span style="">This was the regality of a king. </span></p><p><span style="">The king was overflowing with majesty, and several hundred Users looked on from afar. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">As if they had all agreed to do this, the Users started to sneer as they disparaged the Barbarian King. &#xA0;They started making invidious remarks.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Bitch. &#xA0;We&#x2019;ll kill you this time.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;We now know the clear method for the 2nd Phase. &#xA0;We know it works. &#xA0;We&#x2019;ll catch you this time around.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">When the invidious remarks ended, the leader in charge of the group spoke.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ready the Fire Storm!&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">- We&#x2019;re ready!
