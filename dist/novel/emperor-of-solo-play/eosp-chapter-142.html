<p>Chapter 142 - The Frozen Land (1)</p><p>1.</p><p><span style="">The endless snow that was falling down was swept up by cold winds. &#xA0;It was as if the whole world was shivering.</span></p><p><span style="">Hweeeeeng! &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">The sound of the winds made one&apos;s ears numb. &#xA0;The world had turned white, which blinded one&#x2019;s vision. &#xA0;The only thing one could smell was the coldness.</span></p><p><span style="">During all of this, a User dared to to step onto the snowfield. </span></p><p><span style="">Pooh-poohk.</span></p><p><span style="">The white snowfield became the white predator. &#xA0;Accompanying a terrifying sound, the intruder was swallowed up to his knees.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Fire!&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">- I have no visuals at all! </span></p><p><span style="">In such a ridiculous stage, Sohank was blocking an Ice Bear with his single shield. &#xA0;It was a 10 meters long bear made out of ice, and it wasn&apos;t easy to block it.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;This is crazy.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">Sohank repeated those words until he was sick of it. &#xA0;He was about to repeat it again, when the Ice Bear let out a roar.</span></p><p><span style="">Koo-oh-oh.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;It&apos;s coming.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">Sohank was nervous, but he readied himself.</span></p><p><span style="">Unlike its prior attacks, the Ice Bear used all of its strength to use its Bodyslam.</span></p><p><span style="">Ggwah-ahng! </span></p><p><span style="">Sohank felt an incredible amount of force transferred from across his shield. &#xA0;Sohank&apos;s body was pushed backwards.</span></p><p><span style="">He had barely avoided falling over. &#xA0;He had maintained his stance as he endured the Bodyslam. &#xA0;Sohank busily grinded his teeth inside. </span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;It this was a grassy plains, this bear bastard would....&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">Ice Bear.</span></p><p><span style="">This was his first time facing this monster. &#xA0;It was large, but it wasn&apos;t too difficult to face it in a vacuum. &#xA0;Basically, it didn&apos;t have any special skills. &#xA0;It also didn&apos;t possess incredible strength or incredible Battle AI compared to its size. &#xA0;Moreover, it was fairly easy to maintain the aggro.</span></p><p><span style="">The problem was the environment. &#xA0;The snow was up to his knees, and the ground was covered in ice. &#xA0;It thoroughly vexed Sohank.</span></p><p><span style="">Sohank could always rely on the ground being steady, but he never expected his lack of footing would making him feel so weak. &#xA0;He be skeptical of the ground he was standing on. &#xA0;He never expected such a thing to happen, and it made a chill run up his spine.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Fire!&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Sohank yelled out again. &#xA0;He wasn&apos;t shouting out an order as the commander of the group. &#xA0;His shout was almost close to a plea for help. &#xA0;In his life as a gamer, Sohank would be hard to find an &#xA0;experience that was as humiliating as the one right now.</span></p><p><span style="">- We really can&apos;t see anything! If we use our magic, you might be swept up in it! </span></p><p><span style="">However, it wasn&apos;t easy to help him either. &#xA0;Magician&apos;s had to be judicious with their magic. &#xA0;They had to avoid harming their allies. &#xA0;However, the magicians could barely see the tip of their noses. &#xA0;No matter how accurate these magicians were, it was an impossible situation where they couldn&apos;t fully use their abilities.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Fire!&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">However, Sohank yelled out again.</span></p><p><span style="">- I&apos;m sending it! </span></p><p><span style="">In the end, a magician gave an answer, and at the same time, he threw the ball of fire in his hand forward.</span></p><p><span style="">The ball of fire thrown by the magician started to roll forward. &#xA0;As it rolled forward, it started to expand, and in moments, it took the form of an enormous bear.</span></p><p><span style="">Koo-wah-ahng! </span></p><p><span style="">Flame Bear.</span></p><p><span style="">This scary magical spell was charging forward as it melted the snow away.</span></p><p><span style="">However, Sohank was the one in the path of the charging Flame Bear.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Aigo.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">He was the one that had ordered the use of the magic, but he never expected the Flame Bear to charge at him from his rear.</span></p><p><span style="">Sohank took short breaths. &#xA0;The important part will start now. &#xA0;If he did nothing, he would be sandwiched by the two bears. </span></p><p><span style="">It was the moment of truth. &#xA0;Sohank moved when he saw an opportunity. &#xA0;The Ice Bear had been continuously ramming into his shield. &#xA0;Sohank lashed out at the Ice Bear with his shield.</span></p><p><span style="">Ggwah-ahng! </span></p><p><span style="">A loud sound exploded forth, and the Ice Bear&apos;s body was shifted slightly to the side. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">Koo-roo-roo....</span></p><p><span style="">The Ice Bear had been about to let out a roar, but now it was letting out a low growl. &#xA0;It was a sound made when a beast has reached the peak of its anger.</span></p><p><span style="">However, when the Ice Bear reorientated its head to express its anger, Sohank had disappeared from its field of vision. &#xA0;When he hit the Ice Bear on the head, Sohank had immediately escaped from his current location.</span></p><p><span style="">Sohank had leaped into the air, and he landed on the Ice Bear&apos;s nape.</span></p><p><span style="">As he landed, Sohank took out the dagger equipped on his leg, and he stabbed it into the neck of the Ice Bear.</span></p><p><span style="">Pah-kahk! </span></p><p><span style="">The dagger was planted inside the Ice Bear&apos;s neck. &#xA0;It was in only up to the depth of the middle knuckle. &#xA0;It couldn&apos;t be considered to be a deep wound.</span></p><p><span style="">Koo-ah-ah! </span></p><p><span style="">However, it was enough to drive the Ice Bear into a rage.</span></p><p><span style="">The Ice Bear suddenly stood up. &#xA0;At the same time, it turned to look towards its back. &#xA0;Sohank was hanging on by grabbing onto his dagger. &#xA0;Instead of shaking Sohank off, it planned on biting him. </span></p><p><span style="">Koo-oh-oh! </span></p><p><span style="">It was great timing. &#xA0;The Flame Bear threw itself at the Ice Bear, and it swung its paw. </span></p><p><span style="">Puh-uhng! </span></p><p><span style="">The Flame Bear&apos;s front paw let out a rough sound as it violently struck the Ice Bear&apos;s head.</span></p><p><span style="">Hweeek!</span></p><p><span style="">The Ice Bear&apos;s head snapped to the side, and a terrifying claw mark appeared on its face.</span></p><p><span style="">At that moment, the Ice Bear&apos;s anger wasn&apos;t directed at Sohank at all. &#xA0;It was directed towards the Flame Bear. &#xA0;The two bears immediately started to fight each other. &#xA0;The two bears stood on their hind legs, and they used their front paws to strike at each other. &#xA0;Neither bear backed down, but it wasn&#x2019;t a good battle to watch.</span></p><p><span style="">The Ice Bear was much more stronger than the Flame Bear. &#xA0;The Flame Bear could only leave scratches and wounds on the Ice Bear&apos;s body. &#xA0;The Ice Bear&apos;s attacks took chunks off of the Flame Bear&apos;s body.</span></p><p><span style="">The two bears exchanged about 10 blows in total, and the Flame Bear became mangled. &#xA0;It started to disappear into the snowstorm.</span></p><p><span style="">During all of this, Sohank created wounds on the Ice Bear&apos;s back and waist. &#xA0;Again, the wound wasn&apos;t deep, but the location from where he struck was exquisite. &#xA0;He was at a location where the Ice Bear&apos;s limbs and teeth couldn&apos;t reach him. &#xA0;He was basically in its blind spot.</span></p><p><span style="">From such a location, Sohank yelled out again.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Fire!&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Instead of answering back, the magicians used more magical spells. &#xA0;Accompanying the incantation of the magicians, fireballs and thunder strikes headed towards the Ice Bear. &#xA0;Moreover, it was also coming towards Sohank, who was sticking close to the Ice Bear&apos;s body.</span></p><p><span style="">Koo-oh-oh! </span></p><p><span style="">The Ice Bear let out a roar as it struggled. &#xA0;As the Ice Bear flailed, Sohank started to accumulate a significant amount of damage. &#xA0;Sohank continued to attack it to keep the aggro on him.</span></p><p><span style="">This really was a gambit where Sohank had put his life on the line.</span></p><p><span style="">In such a battle, the rest of the party could do nothing. &#xA0;Natal, who was the leader of this party, didn&apos;t say anything. &#xA0;At this moment, he couldn&apos;t even come up with a word of encouragement for Sohank.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Shit.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">Natal couldn&apos;t do anything. &#xA0;He could only regret over his decision.</span></p><p><span style="">His regret started 8 days ago. &#xA0;It was when they first arrived at this frozen land. &#xA0;As if by magic, the snowstorm had appeared, and Natal was conflicted as to how he should proceed. &#xA0;He wondered if he should allow the group an adjustment time period before they earnestly started their search. &#xA0;On the flip side, they could start searching first, then they could get used to everything.....</span></p><p><span style="">In truth, they planned on following the former plan. &#xA0;They were going to start their search after they got acclimated to this place.</span></p><p><span style="">However, the problem was the urgent news he received.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;If it wasn&apos;t for the Big Smiles....&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">The urgent news said a large contingent of Big Smiles guild members had crossed the Terube castle wall.</span></p><p><span style="">In truth, this was within the realm of possibilities they had postulated. &#xA0;&#xA0;If one had a decent head on one&#x2019;s shoulder, it was easy to connect the dot between the Northland and the third Main Scenario Quest.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;No. If it wasn&apos;t for Sinclair...&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">Sinclair was within this group.</span></p><p><span style="">He wasn&apos;t known to the world, but he was a User that was on par or better than the officers of the 30 great guilds. &#xA0;He was also a person that had received aggressive love calls from all the 30 great guilds, yet he was unwavering in switching his affiliation.</span></p><p><span style="">Yet he was wearing a Big Smiles guild symbol now. &#xA0;Moreover, Natal received information that Sinclair was one of the figures leading the group. &#xA0;Natal couldn&apos;t help, but be thrown into a state of confusion.</span></p><p><span style="">This put a lot of pressure on him. &#xA0;If it was just the Big Smile, he could just treat them as a big dog that moved into the neighborhood. &#xA0;However, this was the Big Smiles guild with Sinclair included in the party. &#xA0;A feral beast had just moved into the neighborhood.</span></p><p><span style="">In the end, Natal decided to accelerate their timeline in finishing the Quest instead of facing off against the Big Smiles guild.</span></p><p><span style="">However, the frozen ground was starting to cause significant delays.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;If things head along this way, they&apos;ll definitely catch up to us.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">They were in a obstacle race, and they were having a hard time getting past the obstacles. &#xA0;They were pretty much stuck.</span></p><p><span style="">Of course, they would be caught by the latecomers.</span></p><p><span style="">- We got it! &#xA0;Stop! </span></p><p><span style="">At that moment, Sohank&apos;s voice was heard in Natal&apos;s ears. &#xA0;At the same time, the Priests ran towards Sohank. &#xA0;They used the Healing skills to quickly mend the wounds. &#xA0;Then they started putting the Buff skills on him as a precaution for the unforeseen circumstances that might occur.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Natal!&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">As he was receiving the skills from the Priests, Sohank immediately called out to Natal.</span></p><p><span style="">Natal approached Sohank, and he gave orders to his subordinates through Voice Talk.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Listen! &#xA0;We don&#x2019;t have much time, so we&#x2019;ll be brief in taking footage for data. &#xA0;Once you guys finish filming, we&#x2019;ll immediately butcher the monster. &#xA0;Clean up after yourselves. &#xA0;Don&apos;t leave behind any Ingredient Coins.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I&apos;ll say this again. &#xA0;We can&apos;t leave behind any trace. &#xA0;The Ingredient Coins won&apos;t disappear.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">His warnings were almost approaching the level of nagging. &#xA0;Even though, he had given his warnings, Natal didn&#x2019;t look to be in a good mood. &#xA0;His expression was screwed up as he started a conversation with Sohank.</span></p><p>2.</p><p><span style="">Poo-oohk! </span></p><p><span style="">A wide and nimble sword was embedded deep within the Hammerhead&apos;s single sharp eyes. &#xA0;The Hammerhead&apos;s body started to shake. &#xA0;It was such a deep wound that the Hammerhead couldn&apos;t even let out a scream.</span></p><p><span style="">Kooh-oohng! </span></p><p><span style="">In the end, the Hammerhead weakly fell to the ground as if it was a large piece of log. A User descended using the fallen Hammerhead&apos;s body as a staircase. &#xA0;Sinclair immediately flipped over the Hammerhead&apos;s body.</span></p><p><span style="">Swhoook! </span></p><p><span style="">After flipping it over, he immediately extracted his sword from the Hammerhead&apos;s single eye. &#xA0;Sinclair sheathed his sword. &#xA0;It was the surest gesture that signified the end of a battle.</span></p><p><span style="">Everyone, who had been watching the battle, let out exclamations.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Amazing. &#xA0;You are really amazing.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Sinclair-nim! You are really incredible!&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Then there were those, who swallowed their exclamations. </span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;How preposterous. &#xA0;He just climbed atop the Hammerhead&apos;s head? &#xA0;If it went awry, he would have been swept up in the Head-butt.... &#xA0;I&apos;ll never be able to do such a thing.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;I know he has the Items, but it is also his incredible skills. &#xA0;Why haven&#x2019;t such a skilled User gained any notoriety yet?&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Why did such a skilled User enter our guild?&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">Of course, not everyone was letting out or swallowing exclamations.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;You did well.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Instead of an exclamation, Apollo spoke as if he was a noble giving praise to his subordinate. &#xA0;He spoke in a disinterested tone. &#xA0;Sinclair also responded in a disinterested manner. &#xA0;He slightly nodded his head.</span></p><p><span style="">Apollo&apos;s expression crumpled a little bit. &#xA0;His presence was being continuously marginalized, so it seemed Apollo didn&apos;t welcome the current situation.</span></p><p><span style="">Sinclair also didn&apos;t like the situation he was in.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;I know this is a job, but I can&apos;t believe I have to lower my head to this guy.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">He had operated without publicizing his face in the past, but Sinclair had been treated with utmost respect and care by everyone as a Helper from the Hands guild. &#xA0;Apollo was nothing if he didn&apos;t have his father&apos;s influence.</span></p><p><span style="">Of course, he didn&#x2019;t look kindly to Apollo holding a role of being his superior.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Be patient. &#xA0;This will come to an end soon.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">He knew the importance of this job, so Sinclair firmly preached patience to himself.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;It won&apos;t be too long.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">After they moved beyond the Terube castle wall, Sinclair led the Big Smiles guild member in a chase after the Hydra guild. &#xA0;They had only one purpose. &#xA0;They were going to start a guild battle against the Hyrdra guild.</span></p><p><span style="">Of course, they didn&#x2019;t plan on fighting a full scale battle. &#xA0;From the Hydra guild&#x2019;s perspective, they weren&#x2019;t keen on a full scale battle either. &#xA0;They would work to avoid that outcome. &#xA0;Reinforcements weren&#x2019;t anywhere near them, and there were no castles or towns beyond the Terube wall. &#xA0;If they performed a fullscale war, it would be basically be akin to a suicide bombing.</span></p><p><span style="">In the end, they&#x2019;ll decide do a 1on1 battle. &#xA0;A great match would ensue, and this was the result wanted by Sinclair.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;If I kill Sohank, everything will change.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">Sohank was the strongest User in the Hydra guild. &#xA0;What was the worth of winning a 1on1 battle against him?</span></p><p><span style="">He had no idea.</span></p><p><span style="">It was incalculable, but just the thought of it was enough to make him smile.</span></p><p><span style="">A smile formed on Sinclair&apos;s lips. &#xA0;One User saw his smile, so the User spoke up.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;It seems you are in a good mood.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Huh?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Nothing. &#xA0;I just saw you smiling, so I....&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">The one that asked the question was Cho-oohroong. &#xA0;He was the one that had built an affinity with Bagel by playing on the Battlefield stage. He was also the one that was able to receive the Northland Exploration Quest.</span></p><p><span style="">Unlike Apollo, Sinclair had a high opinion of Cho-oohroong. &#xA0;Cho-oohroong had helped out Sinclair in various ways, so Sinclair treated him well.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I&#x2019;ll be fighting a skilled User soon. &#xA0;The anticipation I have for the fight must have revealed itself through my expression.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">This was why Sinclair revealed some of his true feelings in front of Cho-oohroong. </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;As expected, you are incredible.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Cho-oohroong had an expression filled with admiration as he looked at Sinclair. &#xA0;Sinclair&apos;s smile deepened when he saw this particular expression.</span></p><p><span style="">This is what he wanted. &#xA0;He didn&apos;t want everyone to look at him as just some nobody. &#xA0;He wanted them to look at him with respect. &#xA0;He didn&apos;t want to be the expert that only other experts knew about. &#xA0;We wanted to become world famous.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Sinclair-nim is probably the only one in this game that feels happy about the prospect of fighting Sohank.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I&apos;m flattered. &#xA0;However, if I don&apos;t win, this would have all been an act of reckless bravado.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;No. &#xA0;From what I just saw now, you will definitely win. &#xA0;Of course, this is assuming the other side doesn&apos;t do anything foul.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">The dayy will come soon. &#xA0;Even people, who didn&apos;t know Sinclair, would look up to him!</span></p><p><span style="">Sinclair&apos;s smile deepened further. &#xA0;It was so deep that his smile couldn&apos;t get any more broader.</span></p><p><span style="">It happened at that moment....</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Uh? There is a Coin here!&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">The atmosphere suddenly changed. &#xA0;Everyone gathered in a single location when they heard the word Coin.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Did you just say Coins?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Try picking it up.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Here it is.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Sinclair immediately held the Coin, and he checked the Coin&apos;s information on the Holographic Window.</span></p><p><span style="">[Deadwood Monkey&apos;s Skin] </span></p><p><span style="">[Deadwood Monkey&apos;s Skin] </span></p><p><span style="">[Deadwood Monkey&apos;s Bone] </span></p><p><span style="">It was the Ingredient Coins from the Deadwood Monkeys.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Isn&apos;t this the 20th one we found?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;We are finding fallen Coins every time we are about to forget about it.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;It seems there is a hole in the Coin Pouch carried by the Hydra guild. &#xA0;It seems they are leaving behind a trail.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Ingredient Coins was a trace that could only be left behind by Users. </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;All of a sudden, we are like Hansel and Gretel following after the breadcrumbs.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Obviously, this tracks was left behind by the Hydra guild. &#xA0;In other words, the Big Smiles guild was on the right path in chasing down the Hydra guild.</span></p><p><span style="">However, Sinclair no longer had a smile on his face. &#xA0;He spoke in an earnest tone.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Let us move faster.&#x201D;</span></p>
