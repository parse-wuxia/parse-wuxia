<p><span style="">Chapter 146 - Frost Knight (2)</span></p><p>3.</p><p><span style="">Before Hyrkan returned to the past, he spent the most important period of his life in Warlord. &#xA0;This was why he could clearly remember the past events so clearly right now.</span></p><p><span style="">The first Main Scenario Quest was the Corrupt Count episode. &#xA0;There had been a lot of confusion during this period of time. &#xA0;Many people experienced something new, and these batch of Users brought a new age of Warlord. &#xA0;At this stage, they were getting interested in the game, and they started paying more attention to this game. </span></p><p><span style="">Everything was still fresh, and everything was unfamiliar.</span></p><p><span style="">The second Main Scenario Quest was something given to those, who finished adjusting to the game the fastest. &#xA0;The Immoral Prince episode was where everything started in earnest. &#xA0;It was an era where Users enjoyed what had unfolded in front of them. &#xA0;It was also the era where people didn&apos;t hold back their money in the pursuit of enjoying this game. &#xA0;It was also an era where it was proven that incredible amount of fame, reputation and money could be earned by simply being good at the game of Warlord.</span></p><p><span style="">The third Main Scenario Quest wasn&apos;t about enjoying oneselves by playing the Ruined Kingdom episode. &#xA0;It was the start of an era where the Users were in search for something. &#xA0;They started anticipating and craving for something. &#xA0;Every masterpiece had a beginning and an end. &#xA0;The Users that started out from the launch of Warlord was starting to become interested in the end.</span></p><p><span style="">The end was the essence of Warlord. &#xA0;The world had been turned into a battle field, and someone would rise above to end the war. </span><span style="">Who was closest to being the &apos;warlord&apos;? </span></p><p><span style="">This was a conversation that would be ongoing until the Warlord came to an end. &#xA0;The person to light this argument on fire was none other than the Storm Queen Shir. &#xA0;It was her.</span></p><p><span style="">Frost Knight. </span></p><p><span style="">The Frost Dragon had put a curse on this ancient kingdom, and there was a monster that was enforcing this curse. &#xA0;This monster was continuously summoning its Cursed underlings, and it used a powerful magic to freeze any enemies that dared to go against it. &#xA0;Even if anyone was able to pierce through all the obstacles laid out in front of it, the monster could summon the Ice Wall of Lament. &#xA0;It also let out a ferocious cold air in its death throes as revenge. &#xA0;The Storm Queen had shown everyone the possibility through all of this. </span></p><p><span style="">It was possible to solo against a Boss Monster!</span></p><p><span style="">Groups of experts of this game had flocked to monsters that had overwhelming strength and ability. &#xA0;It was how everyone used to prove their bravery. &#xA0;However, after her battle against the Frost Knight, soloing a monster with overwhelming strength and ability was the new method used by the Users to prove one&apos;s bravery and skill.</span></p><p><span style="">It was also at this point when he had developed a crush for her.</span></p><p><span style="">Ah! &#xA0;She had such a beautiful appearance.</span></p><p><span style="">She had a flashy look, and her background was unfathomable. &#xA0;However, these were all outstripped by her skills. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">She had revealed a new possibility! </span></p><p><span style="">Moreover, at the time, Hyrkan was able to hold out using the help that been extended to him by her. &#xA0;The Hahoe Mask guild was slowly settling in, but once one paid off the monthly fee to play Warlord, one didn&apos;t have much money to spend on food. He had to live an impoverished life. &#xA0;It wouldn&apos;t have been strange if the Hahoe Mask guild transitioned into a guild that no longer existed. &#xA0;His dream and driving force was the only thing that had kept that guild going.</span></p><p><span style="">Of course, this version of the world no longer existed. &#xA0;Hyrkan was the only one in this world, who remembered this line of history. &#xA0;In a couple years, even he would start to forget about it.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Just admit it.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">However, he can say for certain that he could still remember all of it right now.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;In truth, this is a table set up by the Stormhunters. &#xA0;If I can&apos;t eat everything on this table, I&apos;m the retarded one.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">This was why Hyrkan had to monopolize the Frozen Kingdom.</span></p><p><span style="">This wasn&apos;t him simply expressing his resolve.</span></p><p><span style="">The Stormhunters guild had revealed a comprehensive guide on hunting in the Frozen Kingdom. &#xA0;Even a mediocre guild could clear the Frozen Kingdom with the information they had released. &#xA0;Currently, Hyrkan was using a secret space found by the Stormhunters. &#xA0;It allowed him to avoid the absolute surveillance of the Frost Knight residing at the throne of the Frozen Kingdom.</span></p><p><span style="">Everything had been provided by the Stormhunters guild. &#xA0;In such circumstances, if he failed in achieving what he wanted to do, he wouldn&apos;t just be regretful. &#xA0;He would be thoroughly embarrassed by the situation.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;If I can&apos;t monopolize this by myself, I deserve to quit this game.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">He would be so ashamed that he wouldn&apos;t be able to play this game with a bare face. &#xA0;There was no way others would find out about this failure, but this was about Hyrkan&apos;s own pride. &#xA0;He wouldn&apos;t accept failure.</span></p><p><span style="">This was why Hyrkan was more serious than ever about this venture. &#xA0;He was more serious about it then the time he fought the Immoral Prince. &#xA0;In truth, he hadn&apos;t fought the Immoral Prince after a thorough preparation. &#xA0;Hyrkan had been conflicted as he saw the battle between Storm Queen and the Immoral Prince. &#xA0;After a deliberating over his decision, he decided to act.</span></p><p><span style="">Unlike what he did in the Immoral Prince battle, he had made exhaustive preparations before he crossed the Terube castle wall. &#xA0;This was the result of the meticulous calculation.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;The consumable Items I have left.... &#xA0;I have the exact amount left. &#xA0;I have just enough to catch the Frost Knight.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">Of course, his recent hunt wasn&apos;t actually about leveling up. &#xA0;He was meticulous in his actions as he set up the battle with the Frost Kingdom&apos;s boss monster, the Frost Knight. &#xA0;He hunted until he had the requisite amount of consumable left.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;I hit level 199. &#xA0;That was unexpected.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">At this point in time, he had predicted he would be around 197 or 198. &#xA0;His prediction was off....</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Well, that&apos;s a good thing.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">It was a pleasant miscalculation.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;As expected, the most important part is the Ifrit&apos;s Essence.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">What consumable Items did Hyrkan prepare to take down the Frost Knight? </span></p><p><span style="">There was the Essence made by gathering the Ifrit&apos;s tears. Then there was the holy water made from the Great Priest&apos;s sacred blood, the gum made from the innards of the Glutton Alligator, and the healing clay made from the heart of a Red Troll. </span></p><p><span style="">These were all very expensive Items. &#xA0;Even the 30 great guilds used Items of such high value on the really important Raids.</span></p><p><span style="">Amongst these Items, the most important one was the Ifrit&apos;s Essence!</span></p><p><span style="">One had to catch a rare monster called Ifrit&apos;s Acolyte to obtain this Item. &#xA0;One had to gather Ifrit&apos;s tears then one had to pay a high production cost to create this Item. &#xA0;This item had two effects.</span></p><p><span style="">Fire Attribute Resistance will increase. &#xA0;Any penalty received from Fire type attacks will decrease.</span></p><p><span style="">Ice Attribute Resistance will increase. &#xA0;Any penalty received from Ice type attacks will decrease.</span></p><p><span style="">Ifrit was the Spirit King of Fire. &#xA0;With the help of Ifrit&apos;s powerful strength, one can become a friend of the fire, and at the same time, one gained the power to resist against the cold.</span></p><p><span style="">Originally, this consumable Item was used on Boss Monsters, who had powerful Fire type attacks. &#xA0;It was a one time use Item, and there was a time when it easily cost over 4 thousand gold to purchase it.</span></p><p><span style="">In recent days, the regions where the Ifrit&apos;s Acolyte appeared had increased. &#xA0;As the monster wasn&apos;t as rare any more, the market price had significantly gone down. &#xA0;Still, it was expensive. Hyrkan had bought a whopping 20 Ifrit&apos;s Essence to use in the Frozen Kingdom. &#xA0;He had only one left in his supply. </span></p><p><span style="">Basically, he&apos;ll have only one chance to challenge the Frost Knight.</span></p><p><span style="">In truth, there would be no re-attempt at this.</span></p><p><span style="">If Hyrkan failed at the Frost Knight Raid, he would suffer a Game Over. &#xA0;The place he&apos;ll be revived was the Terube castle wall. &#xA0;Currently, there were numerous Users massing up at the Terube castle wall for the Northland hunt. &#xA0;Moreover, there probably was a good number of Users, who had already met the requirement for the Northland Exploration quest. &#xA0;These users were already in the Northland. &#xA0;If they were skilled and fast, these Users probably had already entered into the territory of the Frozen Kingdom.</span></p><p><span style="">In such a situation, Hykran would be spending his 48 hours in death. &#xA0;To fight the Frost Knight again, he would have to cover a significant amount of distance to get from the Terube castle wall to the Frozen Kingdom. &#xA0;When he got here again, he would have to take a number. &#xA0;He would have to wait in a queue.</span></p><p><span style="">Moreover, the wait time would be significant. &#xA0;He could probably climb the Urugual mountain range once in the time he would have to wait in the queue.</span></p><p><span style="">He shouldn&apos;t go into this expecting a second try.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Cast Iron Rhinoceros Gem and...the Bone Explosives. &#xA0;All of these Items are worth over 100 golds each.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">This was why he had prepared the most expensive Items.</span></p><p><span style="">He had spent an incredible amount. &#xA0;If he failed this Raid, the entire time he had in the Frost Kingdom would register as a loss in his budget.</span></p><p><span style="">After checking the number of Items he had, Hyrkan felt a resoluteness.</span></p><p><span style="">He carefully started placing his organized Items into his pockets and pouches. &#xA0;He felt tense as he carried out this action.</span></p><p><span style="">The Items couldn&apos;t just be stored anywhere. &#xA0;He had to know where these Items were located at, and he had put place it in locations where he could quickly reach it in a desperate situation. &#xA0;He had to be thorough in his calculations.</span></p><p><span style="">The last Item he picked up was the most important consumable Item. &#xA0;it was the Ifrit&apos;s Essence.</span></p><p><span style="">It was large enough that it was a little bit uncomfortable to put it in one&apos;s mouth. &#xA0;Hyrkan carefully picked it up, and he looked inside the Item.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;This is worth more than a month supply of food. &#xA0;It is expensive yet it tastes nasty.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">At that moment....</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Uh?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan unintentionally lost his grip on the Ifrit&apos;s Essence. His fingers were slippery from the frost.</span></p><p><span style="">Took took! </span></p><p><span style="">The fallen Ifrit&apos;s Essence bounced several times before it quickly rolled towards a wall.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Uh!&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">At that moment, Hyrkan became frightened. &#xA0;He looked towards the wall where the Ifrit&apos;s Essence was rolling towards to. &#xA0;There was a big crack at the bottom of the wall. &#xA0;He didn&apos;t have the luxury to express his surprise. &#xA0;When Hyrkan approached the wall, the Ifrit&apos;s Essence fell into the crack. &#xA0;It was like a hole-in-one in golf. &#xA0;It had been that accurate.</span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan didn&apos;t ruminate over the surprise he was feeling. &#xA0;He didn&apos;t waste any time.</span></p><p><span style="">Choo-oong! </span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;If I don&apos;t have this, I can&apos;t beat it. &#xA0;I&apos;ll have to just return to the Terube castle. Please!&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">He immediately took out the sword sheathed at his waist. &#xA0;He started to scratch at the crack with his sword.</span></p><p><span style="">Choo-roong, choo-roong! </span></p><p><span style="">The Crying Sword was a famed sword that had taken down numerous monsters and Users. &#xA0;Currently, it was considered to be one of the ultimate swords amongst the sword carrying Users. &#xA0;It was on par with the Dethroned King&apos;s sword. &#xA0;In a flash, the Crying Sword had been turned into a pickaxe.</span></p><p><span style="">Maybe it was because of this fact. &#xA0;The Crying Sword could be heard making especially mournful wails.</span></p><p><span style="">This sword could make scrap metals of high durability armors, and it could cut through monsters with very high defense. &#xA0;However, it couldn&apos;t make a scratch in this very plain stonework. &#xA0;It was a surprise to him.</span></p><p><span style="">This was when Hyrkan&apos;s accident started to roll forward again.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;What the hell?&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">[This region cannot be destroyed.] </span></p><p><span style="">The System Announcement answered Hyrkan&apos;s question.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Uh?&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">Hrykan&apos;s mishap came to pause. &#xA0;Hyrkan stopped to look up at the plain looking wall. &#xA0;The harsh coldness had caused ice to form over the wall. &#xA0;He looked at the ice wall. &#xA0;Then he looked at the crack that had eaten his precious Item.</span></p><p><span style="">Finally, Hyrkan felt that something was off.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Why is the crack only here?&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan was at a location about ten square meters in size. &#xA0;This alcove reminded him of a cube. &#xA0;The path to enter this location was small. &#xA0;It was a location where the Cursed Monsters under the command of the Frost Knight couldn&apos;t come in. This was the space used by the Storm Hunters guild to safely rest before they had battled the Frost Knight. &#xA0;None other than the Storm Queen herself had explained the use of this location, and how important it was to rest here.</span></p><p><span style="">Of course, every time Hyrkan had to take a break from the battle he had used this location.</span></p><p><span style="">There had been such a crack here?</span></p><p><span style="">If one considered the setting of this stage, even if a User had made a crack, the crack should have been mended over by ice. &#xA0;Moreover, the stage becomes reset when a day passes.</span></p><p><span style="">This basically meant that his crack was clearly intentional. &#xA0;It meant that this crack had been placed here by design.</span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan got up from his seat.</span></p><p><span style="">Choo-roong, choo-roong! &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">The Crying Sword, which had been used by its owner as a pickaxe, started to grumble. &#xA0;This time Hyrkan used the Crying Sword as a tool to peel off the ice from the wall.</span></p><p><span style="">Suh-guhk suh-guhk! </span></p><p><span style="">The sound of the thick ice falling drowned out the Crying Sword&apos;s wailing.</span></p><p><span style="">In the end, the wall revealed the Frozen Kingdom&apos;s emblem. &#xA0;A sun and moon was above a large tree.</span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan put on a smile.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Yes. &#xA0;Luck is once again with me.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan had found something the Stormhunters had never discovered.</span></p><p>4.</p><p><span style="">There had been a kingdom in the Northland that had reached the era of prosperity a long time ago. &#xA0;They were closest to the sun and the moon, and various races lived as one in this kingdom. They were the keepers of peace in the world.</span></p><p><span style="">On a fateful day, a Frost Dragon suddenly appeared, and it crushed the kingdom that was in its era of prosperity. &#xA0;Then it placed a curse on the kingdom.</span></p><p><span style="">It was curse where one could never die, and the weather would never change. &#xA0;It was a curse where one had to forever fight the people that the kingdom had once helped!</span></p><p><span style="">The Frost Dragon even bestowed authority to a knight, so it could keep an eye on the curse. &#xA0;The Frost Dragon appointed the knight as the owner of the capital, which was a mere shell of itself.</span></p><p><span style="">This was the story behind the Frozen Kingdom, and it was also a clue about the Ruined Kingdom.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Finally, I receive the reward for long resisting the evil curse of the Frost Dragon.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan had found a hidden tunnel, and when he followed the tunnel, he reached a location where a being had chained himself a long time ago. This being was so weathered that its body was falling apart. &#xA0;The NPC Nero showed infinite sadness at not being able to die. &#xA0;However, Hyrkan couldn&#x2019;t feel any hatred or confusion from the NPC.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;My name is Nero. &#xA0;I am the last heir to the kingdom that exists only in a nightmare now.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan decided to be bold. &#xA0;He introduced himself.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;My name is Hyrkan. &#xA0;I am nothing special. &#xA0;The world is overflowing with calamity, and I&apos;m an adventurer that is striving towards hope.&#x201D; &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;I hope the cameras are doing a good job.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan had been smart in how he approached this. &#xA0;He started recording beforehand.</span></p><p><span style="">Wasn&apos;t this a truth that even the Stormhunters weren&apos;t able to find out?</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Yes. &#xA0;I always felt a bit disappointed at the Stormhunter&apos;s videos. &#xA0;This is what they missed!&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan was happy. &#xA0;He had to force himself not to laugh. &#xA0;It was almost painful. </span></p><p><span style="">Of course, he wasn&apos;t happy about the fact that he found a truth that the Stormhunters hadn&#x2019;t found. &#xA0;This footage would be part of a pay-per-view full length film, which was currently being made by him. &#xA0;This would be one more point in the story that would be added to the film about the Frozen Kingdom quest. &#xA0;He felt happy about the sweet reward he would receive from it.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Is that so? &#xA0;That makes me happy. &#xA0;I&apos;m happy that a hero like you still exists in this world.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I&apos;m not a hero. &#xA0;Anyways, I cannot fathom how you came to be in this state.... &#xA0;I will undo your chains.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Please don&apos;t. &#xA0;These chains allows me to hold onto my intellect. If you unchain me, I&apos;ll be just like the poor souls wandering outside..&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;&#x2026;what happened here?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Nero started to tell his story after being questioned. &#xA0;Hyrkan didn&apos;t ask any more questions. &#xA0;He just calmly listened to the story.</span></p><p><span style="">The story wasn&apos;t that much different from the one known by Hyrkan.</span></p><p><span style="">The Frost Dragon had put a curse on the prosperous kingdom, and it caused the kingdom to freeze. &#xA0;After everything was frozen, things had pretty much stayed the same until now.</span></p><p><span style="">When the story ended, Nero naturally gave Hyrkan a mission.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;You are the only one I can ask this of. &#xA0;I know better than anyone that the Ruined Kingdom cannot be brought back. &#xA0;I just want revenge. &#xA0;If revenge isn&apos;t possible, at the very least, free the tormented people from under the Frost Dragon&apos;s knight.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">[The Quest &apos;Kingdom&apos;s Revenge&apos; has started.] </span></p><p><span style="">[The Quest &apos;Evidence to the Ruined Kingdom&apos;.] </span></p><p><span style="">[You&apos;ve gained the Title Agent of Revenge&#x2019;.] </span></p><p><span style="">[You&apos;ve gained the Title &apos;One who Earned the Evidence of the Ruined Kingdom&apos;.] </span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan was barely able to stop himself from laughing at the System Announcement. &#xA0;He fixed a serious expression on his face, and he nodded his head. &#xA0;He had his mask on, but Hyrkan wasn&apos;t even conscious of this fact. &#xA0;This was how happy he was.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">At that moment...</span></p><p><span style="">[The curtain to the new era has risen.] </span></p><p><span style="">[The one to open this new era is &apos;Hyrkan&apos;.] </span></p><p><span style="">The System Announcement was heard in Hyrkan&apos;s ears, and it was heard by everyone currently enjoying the game of Warlord.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Uh?&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">Once again Hyrkan&apos;s mishap came to a standstill.</span></p>
