<p><span style="">Chapter 108 - Catacombs (3)</span></p><p><span style="">When he was filming the Waltz video, a thought had gone through Hyrkan&apos;s mind.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;This won&apos;t make any money&#x2026;&#x2026;.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">However, his prediction had been very off, and he had been very happy at being proven wrong. &#xA0;The Waltz video allowed Hyrkan to make a leap into becoming a star.</span></p><p><span style="">With this as context, today&apos;s footage might be a big failure.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;This will make me some money.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">At that moment, Hyrkan felt something entirely different from when he had filmed the Waltz video. &#xA0;His hunch, intuition and instinct was the polar opposite of what he had felt that time.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;I really feel like this will be a jackpot.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan had finally exited the tortuous maze, and he had arrived at a new entrance.</span></p><p><span style="">It was the entrance to an Instant Dungeon, where he wouldn&apos;t be able to come out once he entered. It was clearly evident that this place was where the Catacomb&apos;s Stage Boss was located at. </span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan didn&apos;t show any hesitation as he jumped into the stage. He didn&apos;t have any worries. &#xA0;He had &#xA0;plenty of consumable Items. &#xA0;Moreover, his body was itching at the thought of getting out of this boring Catacombs. </span></p><p><span style="">In the end, he reached a massive graveyard. The graveyard was large enough to be reminiscent of a small domed stadium. It was a cemetery filled with skeletons of Chimeras. &#xA0;It was also filled with the ownerless armors and weapons.</span></p><p><span style="">It was a Dungeon befitting the name of Catacombs. &#xA0;It was mass graveyard for the Chimeras.</span></p><p><span style="">[Who dares to wake me from my rest!] </span></p><p><span style="">There was an ogre here.</span></p><p><span style="">No, it wasn&apos;t an ordinary ogre. It was a skeleton made out of ogre bones, and it had a clear and distinct emblem... It was the trigon emblem. &#xA0;The ogre had a big emblem belonging to Prince Dean engraved on the chest armor it was wearing.</span></p><p><span style="">[What are the Guards doing?] </span></p><p><span style="">Its voice was very menacing, and it let out a roar. &#xA0;The ogre skeleton&apos;s right hand held a fearsome and large iron mace. &#xA0;Its left held a weird looking lantern. &#xA0;It was a gem hanging on a chain, and it was giving out a purple light.</span></p><p><span style="">Even at this point, Hyrkan&apos;s intuition still hadn&apos;t thought this would be a jackpot. &#xA0;Hyrkan was trying hard to come up with a method that&#x2019;ll allow him to dispose the Catacomb&apos;s Boss Monster and the Guards.</span></p><p><span style="">It happened at that moment.</span></p><p><span style="">[You disgraceful bastards! Get up! Get up and get rid of this being, who interferes with my rest!] </span></p><p><span style="">The Gem Lantern held by the Catacomb Guardian let out a powerful purple light. Something akin to ghosts started to exit out of the purple light, and it was being absorbed into skeletons scattered in the surrounding.</span></p><p><span style="">At that moment, Hyrkan had a hunch.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Maybe?&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">This Boss Monster&apos;s special ability was quite clear.</span></p><p><span style="">It was a type that can summon Skeleton underlings. &#xA0;Basically, this type of monsters were labeled Lich style monster. They were pretty rare to come across, but they weren&apos;t an anomaly. &#xA0;They weren&apos;t that special.</span></p><p><span style="">This would be true if the opponent hadn&apos;t been Hyrkan.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Finally, I&apos;ve finally achieved a great Matchup.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">He was Warlord&apos;s best Necromancer, and he was a new breed of Necromancer.... &#xA0;He was the Hahoe Mask Hyrkan, who had founded the Hahoe Mask style.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;This is a really big Match up.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">If these confluence of factors weren&apos;t present, this battle wouldn&apos;t have been given any special meaning by Hyrkan.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;I can get 10 million at the very least.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">Since he was the Hahoe Mask, this Boss Raid was special. &#xA0;It&apos;ll be memorable one.</span></p><p><span style="">It was a battle between the Lich Style Boss Monster and the Hahoe Mask Necromancer. &#xA0;If one was fan of the Hahoe Mask and a fan who enjoyed watching Warlord, this was a matchup impossible to ignore.</span></p><p><span style="">[You bastard. &#xA0;You will pay the price of waking me from my rest!] </span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan let out a roar, then he let shouted towards the Catacomb Guardian.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;You&apos;ll make me pay the price? &#xA0;How dare you! &#xA0;I am the Hahoe Mask, yet you want to make me pay?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan spoke his line as he acted out the scene.</span></p><p><span style="">This battle would be worth a lot. &#xA0;This was why he had to act cool and act the part!</span></p><p><span style="">Of course, he regretted saying it the moment the words left his mouth.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Those lines didn&apos;t sound too great. It&apos;s embarrassing.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">Of course, an NG was always possible in acting. With the Catacomb Guardian letting out its angry words in front of him, Hyrkan earnestly thought about his new lines.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Yes. This is it.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">He finally came up with a new line. &#xA0;Hyrkan made a pose, and he once again yelled out his words.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;A price&#x2026;&#x2026; You will feel it in your bones as to who I am.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">The line he gave was still very corny.</span></p><p><span style="">However, there was a smile on Hyrkan&apos;s lips as if he liked the line he gave.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Feel it in your bones! That&apos;ll be a famous line.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">If a screenwriter could look into Hyrkan&apos;s heart, he would have a dumbfounded expression on his face.</span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan was oblivious to this fact. &#xA0;He was drunk on his own words. &#xA0;Of course, he did what he had to do even if we was drunk.</span></p><p><span style="">[Kill the one, who interferes with my rest!] </span></p><p><span style="">It had already prepared itself for battle. &#xA0;Ten Chimera Skeleton was staring at him. &#xA0;In a flash, Hyrkan held a gem in his hand. &#xA0;He closed his fist as if he was trying to squeeze the gem.</span></p><p><span style="">Drip drip! </span></p><p><span style="">Bright light came out of the gem as it dripped to the floor.</span></p><p><span style="">Koo koo koo! </span></p><p><span style="">The gem was absorbed into the floor, and the ground started to shake. &#xA0;Dirt shot up, and a golem that was as big as the Catacomb Guardian appeared.</span></p><p><span style="">The Golem looked like an ogre. &#xA0;On top of that fact, the ogre possessed two heads.</span></p><p><span style="">It was the Twin Head Ogre.</span></p><p><span style="">It was a level 110 Boss Monster, and amongst the Users, it was known to be the most difficult Ogre to deal with. &#xA0;It was considered to be one of the strongest Ogres in this this game.</span></p><p><span style="">This was obvious, but the ingredient gem of this monster was incredibly expensive. &#xA0;The price of a gem differed by 500 gold depending on its scarcity.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;My one month food money was blown in one shot.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan had saved this one for emergency. &#xA0;He really didn&apos;t want to use this one. &#xA0;He prayed that he&apos;ll never encounter a situation where he would have to use it. &#xA0;He kept it close to his bosom as if it was a golden ingot.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;All right. Let&apos;s just do this.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">However, at that moment, Hyrkan erased all thoughts about money from his mind.</span></p><p><span style="">He painted a picture in his mind.</span></p><p><span style="">After he summoned the Twin Head Ogre, he immediately scattered 10 Skeleton Fragments on the floor. He summoned 10 Skeleton with a picture in mind.</span></p><p><span style="">The Catacomb Guardian had also summoned 10 Chimera Skeletons.</span></p><p><span style="">With each ogre as the commanders, the Undead units faced each other.</span></p><p><span style="">This was like the scene where actors were getting ready for a full scale battle. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">Then Hyrkan flicked his finger twice to give the cue.</span></p><p><span style="">This was the sequel hit after the Waltz video. &#xA0;It was the start of the &apos;Battle of the Bones.&apos;</span></p><p><span style="">The first clash was a landslide victory for Hyrkan. &#xA0;The Skeleton Warriors received the Skeleton Knight&apos;s buff and the Skeleton Science&apos;s effect. &#xA0;Moreover, the Skeleton Warriors were fully equipped, so they were like nightmares for the Chimera Skeletons.</span></p><p><span style="">Moreover, the Catacomb Guardian merely stood in the back as it directed the battle. &#xA0;On the other hand, the Twin Head Ogre golem used both of its hands to swing its enormous club. &#xA0;It ruthlessly pummeled the Chimera Skeletons. &#xA0;The Chimera Skeleton&apos;s heads flew into the distance like a baseball.</span></p><p><span style="">[How laughable!] </span></p><p><span style="">When the first charge ended, the Catacomb Guardian swung his Gem Lantern once again. &#xA0;Another twenty Chimera Skeletons appeared.</span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan once again matched their numbers. &#xA0;He summoned additional Skeleton underlings. &#xA0;There were three Skeleton Magicians mixed in with the group.</span></p><p><span style="">They wore luxurious robes, which was embroidered with numerous symbols. &#xA0;They held an expensive staff with a gem embedded on the top. &#xA0;The addition of the Skeleton Magicians allowed Hyrkan to win in a bigger landslide.</span></p><p><span style="">Three Skeleton Magician threw massive fireballs, and it ruthlessly crushed the Chimera Skeletons, who were lined up for battle. &#xA0;Their battle line was broken, and the Skeleton Warriors waded in as they went berserk. If this game was an AOS game instead of a RPG, a firework would have exploded atop the Skeleton Knight with the word pentakill.</span></p><p><span style="">[Stupid bastards!] </span></p><p><span style="">The Catacomb Guardian swung its Gem Lantern once again. &#xA0;Its third unit was summoned. &#xA0;It summoned 30 Chimera Skeletons this time. </span></p><p><span style="">Now the Catacomb Guardian held the numerical advantage.</span></p><p><span style="">[I&apos;ll do this myself!] </span></p><p><span style="">The Catacomb Guardian had been hanging back until now, but the Catacomb Guardian moved forward as it easily shook its enormous mace. </span></p><p><span style="">When he saw this, Hyrkan raised the Ivan&apos;s Sword.</span></p><p><span style="">The third clash would be different from the other two. It was the beginning where the ogres would clash.</span></p><p><span style="">The Catacomb Guardian and the Ogre Golem unhesitatingly swung their fearsome weapons at each other.</span></p><p><span style="">Kwahng! </span></p><p><span style="">The mace swung by the Catacomb Guardian crushed a head of the Ogre Golem with a single swing.</span></p><p><span style="">Ggah-ahng! </span></p><p><span style="">The weapon swung by the Ogre Golem impacted on the side of the Catacomb Guardian&apos;s armor. &#xA0;It made an ugly dent.</span></p><p><span style="">Kahng, kahng! </span></p><p><span style="">The Skeletons started to fight when the clash between the ogres started. Their weapons were impacting on each other&apos;s armors, so the surrounding was filled with the sound of steel impacting on steel. &#xA0;The sound itself increased the confusion one felt.</span></p><p><span style="">However, Hyrkan was moving covertly and swiftly through this racket. &#xA0;He approached the rear of the Catacomb Guardian. Within the melee, Hyrkan accurately found the right path. &#xA0;He moved through the melee almost like he was threading a needle. He was able to reach the rear of the Catacomb Guardian too easily.</span></p><p><span style="">However...</span></p><p><span style="">[How laughable!] </span></p><p><span style="">The Ogre Golem was exchanging blows with the Catacomb Guardian, and neither combatants were retreating. &#xA0;However, the Catacomb Guardian must have felt Hyrkan&apos;s approach, and its voice stabbed into Hyrkan&apos;s ears like a knife.</span></p><p><span style="">[The Catacomb Gem Lantern is letting out a bleak Energy.] </span></p><p><span style="">[The Catacomb Gem Lantern&apos;s curse has seized you.] </span></p><p><span style="">The Announcement was heard immediately.</span></p><p><span style="">It was an automatic curse that activated based on proximity of the User. &#xA0;Moreover, it wasn&apos;t a curse targeted at a specific user. &#xA0;The Catacomb Guardian activated its special ability, which was an AOE.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;How laughable.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">However, Hyrkan wasn&apos;t surprised or taken aback. &#xA0;Instead, he put on a bloody smile.</span></p><p><span style="">As he put on the bloody smile, he chewed on one of the three candies in his mouth.</span></p><p><span style="">[&#x2018;White Imoogi&apos;s Eye Candy&#x2019; has blocked the curses effect.] </span></p><p><span style="">He had put a consumable Item in his mouth, and it would help him block any debuff skills like the curse. This was the most basic strategy used by a Striker.</span></p><p><span style="">Of course, Hyrkan knew about the basics. &#xA0;The Catacomb Guardian&apos;s curse didn&apos;t take hold on Hyrkan. &#xA0;Hyrkan used his quick movements to attach himself on the back of the Catacomb Guardian.</span></p><p><span style="">Thanks to Twin Head Ogre Golem&apos;s strike denting the armor, Hyrkan was able to climb it easily. &#xA0;As the unofficial V Gear climbing world record holder, this was like traveling in a subway. &#xA0;There were numerous places to grip.</span></p><p><span style="">After grabbing a hand hold, Hyrkan immediately stabbed the Ivan&apos;s Sword into one of the dents.</span></p><p><span style="">Kah-ahng! </span></p><p><span style="">The armor was unexpectedly sturdy. &#xA0;He needed to break through this armor for his Curses to take hold. &#xA0;It was an annoying development.</span></p><p><span style="">However, Hyrkan immediately stabbed the Ivan&apos;s Sword to the same location he had stabbed before.</span></p><p><span style="">Chee-jeek! </span></p><p><span style="">No, he didn&apos;t stab it. He had scratched out an X on the surface of the Catacomb Guardian&apos;s armor.</span></p><p><span style="">[Catacomb Guardian was afflicted with the Demon Curse.] </span></p><p><span style="">[Catacomb Guardian was afflicted with Slow Curse.] </span></p><p><span style="">[Catacomb Guardian was afflicted with Corrosive Ghost.] </span></p><p><span style="">[Catacomb Guardian was afflicted with Darkness.] </span></p><p><span style="">[Catacomb Guardian was afflicted with Lethargy.] </span></p><p><span style="">The Curses swirled around the Catacomb Guardian&apos;s entire body.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Voodoo Pictograph is great. It&apos;s a great skill.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">He didn&apos;t have to wound his opponent&apos;s body. &#xA0;He just had to draw a predetermined shape, and it would grant Curses to the opponent. &#xA0;It was thanks to the effect of a Skill called &apos;Voodoo Pictograph&apos;.</span></p><p><span style="">It was a Skill he earned as a Quest Reward, and it was a Rare Rank Skill.</span></p><p><span style="">[I don&apos;t believe it!] </span></p><p><span style="">After being Cursed, the Catacomb Guardian&apos;s body rapidly weakened. Its decline was inevitable.</span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan&apos;s Demon Curse and Slow Curse was Rank A. &#xA0;The Corrosive Ghost was Rank B, and Lethargy was Rank C.</span></p><p><span style="">Moreover, his Curse Science skill had reached Rank C, so the effect and duration of the Curses increased by 12 percent.</span></p><p><span style="">Lastly, Hyrkan held the Ivan&apos;s Sword, which ignored the opponent&apos;s defense by 15%.</span></p><p><span style="">Kwah-jeek! </span></p><p><span style="">The third strike finally opened a hole on the Catacomb Guardian&apos;s armor.</span></p><p><span style="">[How dare you!] </span></p><p><span style="">The Catacomb Guardian raged. &#xA0;It roughly shook its body as it tried to dislodge Hyrkan.</span></p><p><span style="">However, Hyrkan wasn&apos;t some trash, who would be thrown off with such a weak shake. Moreover, its opponent wasn&apos;t Hyrkan. &#xA0;It was the Twin Head Ogre Golem. &#xA0;One of the golem&apos;s head had been crushed, but it still had one head left. &#xA0;The loss of one head had revealed the Twin Head Ogre&apos;s increasingly tyrannical nature. &#xA0;It pushed hard against the Catacomb Guardian.</span></p><p><span style="">Kah-ahng, kah-ahng! </span></p><p><span style="">It swung the club with both hands. &#xA0;It pounded away at the Catacomb Guardian&apos;s body like a drum. &#xA0;This actually caused more turbulence for Hyrkan.</span></p><p><span style="">Ggah-ahng, ggah-ahng! </span></p><p><span style="">In the midst of the turbulence, Hyrkan enlarged the hole. His vision was shaking so much that it wouldn&apos;t have surprised anyone if Hyrkan fell sick from the motion sickness. However, Hyrkan was like a master craftsman. &#xA0;His hand movements were precise. </span></p><p><span style="">He finally made a hole of his liking. &#xA0;It was big enough to put in as many Bone Explosives as Hyrkan wanted.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;This is a battle tactic I saved for a day like this.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan put the Bone Explosives into the hole.</span></p><p><span style="">- Kwah-ahng! </span></p><p><span style="">The Tablet PC was connected to bluetooth speakers, and the sound rang out in all direction. At the center of the sound of the explosion, Che-sulyun was watching raptly. &#xA0;She had a strange expression on her face as if she was a action movie fan watching Die Hard&apos;s explosion scene.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;The Bone Explosives can be used that way?&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">It was a scene where the Hahoe Mask had put a hole in the Catacomb Guardian&apos;s armor. &#xA0;The hole was filled with Bone Explosives, and they were detonated.</span></p><p><span style="">In all of Warlord, the Hahoe Mask was the only one capable of showing this scene. &#xA0;Che-sulyun couldn&apos;t pull her eyes away from the scene.</span></p><p><span style="">Of course, a single blow couldn&apos;t kill the Catacomb Guardian. &#xA0;Its armor was ruined from the Bone Explosives, but the Catacomb Guardian continued to hang on to its life.</span></p><p><span style="">When its HP was suddenly reduced, the Catacomb Guardian went into its next phase.</span></p><p><span style="">- I will not let you leave alive! Wake up! Everyone get up! </span></p><p><span style="">When the Catacomb Guardian went into the new Phase, it summoned 50 Chimera Skeletons. &#xA0;Moreover, it started letting out a purple energy, which shaved away HP went it touched the enemy.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;You are watching that scene again, master?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;This is the best part.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I know it&apos;s a great scene, but how many times do you have to watch it??&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;It is called a great scene, because it stays cool even after you watch it again and again. &#xA0;Moreover, the real stuff starts after the explosion.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Matador Chev. </span></p><p><span style="">He couldn&apos;t tear his eyes away from the battle footage between the Hahoe Mask and the Catacomb Guardian. &#xA0;He was one of countless people, who couldn&apos;t tear their eyes away from the footage.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;If we immediately sell Raid Live tickets with the Hahoe Mask as the main draw, we could probably sell million tickets depending on the match up. &#xA0;In a year, it wouldn&apos;t be farfetched for the Hahoe Mask will allow us to sell 10 million tickets.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">At that moment, someone who considered himself to be the cream of the crop was also watching the same vid.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What are you looking at, Mr. Sinclair?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;It&apos;s nothing&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Sinclair. </span></p><p><span style="">Currently, he had on a V&amp;V emblem on his chest. When the V&amp;V guild officer asked him a question, he gave a vague answer. The V&amp;V guild officer didn&apos;t want to get on Sinclair&apos;s nerves, so he didn&apos;t repeat his question. &#xA0;He carefully passed on the information.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;We&apos;ll start the raid in 30 minutes. We look forward to working with you again.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes, understood. &#xA0;Also, you don&apos;t have to come look for me every time. &#xA0;You can just send me a message. &#xA0;Currently, I&apos;m a normal member of the V&amp;V guild.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ha ha. I&apos;m just treating you like a future guild officer.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Thank you.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">After exchanging a slight nod with the him, the V&amp;V guild officer left. &#xA0;When he saw the back of the V&amp;V guild officer, Sinclair turned his head to focus on the footage once again.</span></p><p><span style="">While he watched the footage, he admitted something.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;That damn Hahoe Mask. &#xA0;I&apos;ll admit it. He is a remarkable bastard.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">He admitted the Hahoe Mask wasn&apos;t a normal guy. &#xA0;Furthermore, he admitted the Hahoe Mask wasn&apos;t a normal User.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;He has the ability to command others. &#xA0;Now he has that special quality that makes people pay attention to him.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">He accepted it, but he also became worried and guarded.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Maybe this guy might be a bigger threat than the 30 great guilds. If it is as expected, he possesses a massive amount of funds. &#xA0;The only thing he is lacking is level. If he reaches the level of the Rankers, less than 10 people in the entire Warlord could face him 1on1.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">At that moment, there was a fourth person watching the video.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ooh-ha-ha! It&apos;s a jackpot! &#xA0;Jackpot! I knew my intuition wasn&#x2019;t dead yet. Look at the view counts rise! Kyahh! I need to treat myself to some luxury on a day like this. I&apos;ll eat until my stomach bursts!&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">He put canned tuna and tofu into the Kimchi Jjigae. He brought out the tender white rice, and toasted seaweed that was glistening with oil. He sat in front of a 50 inch monitor, which didn&apos;t suit the one room. &#xA0;As he enjoyed the feast, he watched a video. &#xA0;The main character of the footage was Ahn-jaehyun.</span></p>
