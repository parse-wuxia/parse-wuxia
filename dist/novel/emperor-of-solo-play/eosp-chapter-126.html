<p><span style="">Chapter 126 - Argardo Raid (1)</span></p><p>1.</p><p><span style="">There was an appetizing pink sausage with egg wrapped around it in front of him. &#xA0;There was also fresh vegetable, tuna and a kelp soup with plenty of beef and seasoning in it. &#xA0;He piled on the side dishes on the bowl of white rice. &#xA0;Ahn-jaehyun was busy chewing, but his expression wasn&apos;t that great.</span></p><p><span style="">Surprisingly, Ahn-jaehyun was very dissatisfied with the menu.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;If it wasn&apos;t for this event, I would have already replenished my strength by eating stamina-increasing food. I would be playing the game by now.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">In truth, Ahn-jaehyun had planned on stuffing himself with stamina-increasing food the whole time he was running the great battle. He was going to need a strong body more so than any other time, yet he recently felt his physical fitness get worse.</span></p><p><span style="">This was why he had saved up his money. &#xA0;Basically, he set aside a saving that was specifically for buying stamina-increasing food.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Shit. &#xA0;I never expected to spend so much here.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">The Shezga castle defense was over and his calculations was done. &#xA0;This was why he wasn&apos;t comfortable eating an expensive meal. &#xA0;He had spent way more than expected. &#xA0;Moreover, the bigger problem was the fact that he had used most of the consumable Items he had in storage.</span></p><p><span style="">Warlord Users, especially the Rankers, had plenty of Storage space. &#xA0;With the important hunts, battles and raids in one&apos;s immediate future, one didn&#x2019;t have the time to be scrambling all over the place to purchase the consumables.</span></p><p><span style="">Currently, Ahn-jaehyun didn&apos;t just have one big mountain to climb. &#xA0;He had two big mountains left. &#xA0;Of course, Ahn-jaehyun was like an ant conserving food in the summer, so it could have a store in winter. &#xA0;He had to tighten his belt once again. </span></p><p><span style="">In that context, the food he was eating right now was definite proof that displayed Ahn-jaehyun&apos;s elevated position. &#xA0;His food and his position within Warlord had gone through a big change. &#xA0;This was seen on Ahn-jaehyun&apos;s youtube page. &#xA0;The number of subscribers, the number of people viewing his videos, and the purchase of his pay-per-view video was on an upward trajectory again.</span></p><p><span style="">This was especially true about the videos he released during the defense of the Shezga castle. &#xA0;He had revealed the know-hows of the great battle for the first time. &#xA0;His Eat the Tail video had already racked up close to 30 million views. &#xA0;This thought relaxed his rigid expression. </span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Well, I won&apos;t be able to recover it immediately, but I&apos;ll slowly gain back what I invested this time around.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">When he thought about the recent corporate sponsorship proposal he received, the &#xA0;pink sausage tasted like a Wagyu steak. &#xA0;His food tasted better. Ahn-jaehyun&apos;s spoon and chopsticks started to move vigorously.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Huh?&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">Before he knew it, Ahn-jaehyun had let go of his spoon.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;It&apos;s finally happened!&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">Ahn-jaehyun had moved past the 80% mark of climbing a mountain, and the 90% mark was in sight right in front of him.</span></p><p>2.</p><p><span style="">After the Hahoe Mask&apos;s interview ended, all the 30 great guilds fought each other to be the first one to announce that they were going to participate in the great battle. &#xA0;It was as if they had been waiting for this opportunity.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;We will only participate in the great battle in stages where the normal Users are suffering. &#xA0;Aside from those instances, we will leave the rest to the Users. Please think of our actions as maintaining the order.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Their excuse was that they were going to maintain order.</span></p><p><span style="">Of course, the normal Users were split on the decision.</span></p><p><span style="">If one set aside whether the defense of the castles was successful or not, there were a portion of Users that were benefitting greatly from participating in the great battle. &#xA0;They opposed the decision made by the 30 great guilds. &#xA0;It was a fact. If the 30 great guilds participated, the pie had to be shared with more people. &#xA0;Moreover, the Hahoe Mask had revealed how to clear the Corrupted army. &#xA0;If the Underfoot guilds, and the Users massed in numbers, they were confident that they could succeed in defending the castles by themselves.</span></p><p><span style="">On the other hand, the Users below level 100, who hadn&apos;t participated in the great battle, rejoiced at the 30 great guild&apos;s participation. It was true that the high level Users caused a lot of disturbance in hunting grounds occupied by the low level Users. &#xA0;The 30 great guilds were going to fix that problem, so there was no reason for them to disagree with the 30 great guild&apos;s announcement.</span></p><p><span style="">The opinions were split, but the important part was that there was a portion of the Users that agreed with the involvement of the 30 great guilds.</span></p><p><span style="">During all of this, the V&amp;V guild and the 8 guilds, who had announced their non-participation, was put in an awkward spot.</span></p><p><span style="">There were a lot of chatter online about them.</span></p><p><span style="">- What about those guilds that put out a joint statement saying they won&apos;t participate in this event?</span></p><p><span style="">- If those guys have any honor or pride, they&apos;ll stay out of this.</span></p><p><span style="">For these 9 guilds, the breakthrough happened when they decided to retake the castles instead of defending them. &#xA0;The 9 guilds aggressively stepped forward to take back the fallen castles.</span></p><p><span style="">Some Users saw it as a hollow gesture, but they weren&apos;t too upset by it. &#xA0;The retaking of the castles was couple degrees harder than defending it. &#xA0;This was confirmed when the retaking efforts failed multiple times in a row.</span></p><p><span style="">This resulted in the 30 great guilds not competing against each other as everyone contributed in different roles.</span></p><p><span style="">Some participated in the retaking the castles and the rest defended the castles. &#xA0;The Users had been pushed back endlessly, but the situation was quickly changing. </span></p><p><span style="">The Corrupted army was starting to be pushed back. &#xA0;The Corrupted army had to turn the tide of the battle, so a new card was played by them.</span></p><p><span style="">It appeared at that moment.</span></p><p><span style="">[An incredible Boss Monster has appeared at the Havanz castle!]</span></p><p>3.</p><p><span style="">Havanz castle.</span></p><p><span style="">In the past, it had been called the Cursed castle, and it was at this location where the Corrupted army&apos;s hidden ace card made an appearance.</span></p><p><span style="">Havanz castle.</span></p><p><span style="">The dreary atmosphere from the past was gone. It was a place where high level Users wearing elegant and expensive Items frequented before. &#xA0;The castle was in an appalling state compared to the past. &#xA0;The castle walls looked like ruins that had been destroyed several thousand years ago. Moreover, it was hard to find an intact buildings beyond the castle wall.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Start the magical bombardment!&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">On this wretched stage, a heartless assessment started once again.</span></p><p><span style="">Before the man&apos;s shout could come to an end, several hundred magicians used their pre-casted magic.</span></p><p><span style="">At the very least, one had to be over level 130.</span></p><p><span style="">At the very least, one had to have a Rank of Rare.</span></p><p><span style="">These were the magicians that had invested all their Stats into Intelligence. &#xA0;They were popularly known as the &apos;Extreme Mages&apos;. </span></p><p><span style="">The use of their magic was harmonious. &#xA0;The earth type magic was the first to be used. &#xA0;Uniform earthen walls erupted from the ground. &#xA0;It was over 20 meters tall. &#xA0;However, these weren&apos;t just simple earthen walls. It was called the Shield Wall, and it was able to stop physical and magical attacks.</span></p><p><span style="">The Shield Walls gathered to form a triangle.</span></p><p><span style="">The powerful magic spells were thrown into the triangle. &#xA0;The enormous fireballs burned the forest, and the thunder strikes were falling like a shower. &#xA0;Enormous ice spears were descending like lightning.</span></p><p><span style="">Koo koo koo! </span></p><p><span style="">The powerful magic made the ground cry.</span></p><p><span style="">Hell. </span></p><p><span style="">This was the only expression that could describe the scene.</span></p><p><span style="">The one watching this sight was Sweeper guild&apos;s primary Raid team leader. &#xA0;Spearman Ichni gulped.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Please work.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">It didn&apos;t matter in regards to other aspects, but the Sweepers guild was known for being the best in fighting with magic amongst the 30 great guilds. &#xA0;The large scale magic bombardment shown right now by the Sweepers guild was something they were proud of.</span></p><p><span style="">This was why Ichni always smiled with confidence when he saw the powerful collaboration of magic. &#xA0;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">However, he felt a mixture of fear, nervousness and anxiousness as he swallowed his spit. This was the first time for him.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;I&apos;m not expecting it to die, but at the very least, I want it to take some damage. &#xA0;Just a little bit. &#xA0;If that doesn&#x2019;t happen, at least damage its armor! Please!&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">He even prayed.</span></p><p><span style="">However, Ichni gulped once again as the prayer fell to the pit of his stomach.</span></p><p><span style="">Kwah-ahng! </span></p><p><span style="">A thundering noise rang out as one Shield Wall broke. &#xA0;All the racket created by various magic leaked out of the hole. Smoke, fire, sparks... On top of all the noise, one could hear the sound of footsteps.</span></p><p><span style="">The owner of footsteps was a knight wearing armor. The armor he wore wasn&apos;t normal. It was a silver colored armor with a black pattern on it. &#xA0;There was an eagle&apos;s head decorated on the right shoulder, and the left shoulder was decorated with the head of a lion. On his chest, there was the circular crest of the three snakes biting each other.</span></p><p><span style="">On top of it all, the black pattern was perpetually moving like a living fish across the silver amor.</span></p><p><span style="">The knight didn&apos;t have a shield.</span></p><p><span style="">Instead, he held a sword that that constantly rang out as if it was weeping.</span></p><p><span style="">In some ways, the sword looked shabby and worthless. </span></p><p><span style="">Large boss monsters were big enough to intimidate the Users on sight. &#xA0;However, this knight was of a size where it was hard to locate him in the mayhem.</span></p><p><span style="">When Ichni caught sight of the knight, he desperately yelled out. It was the first time he yelled out like this, since he started playing Warlord.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Retreat!&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">At Ichni&apos;s command, his subordinate next to him reflexively asked the question. &#xA0;In truth, it was hard for him to comprehend why they had to retreat. &#xA0;It had been less than 10 minutes, since they had started the battle with the knight. After several sporadic exchange, this was the first time they had used the magic bombardment in earnest, yet they were going to retreat?</span></p><p><span style="">However, Ichni was decisive.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;How can we fight something that can&#x2019;t be damage by physical, magical or holy attacks? &#xA0;Everyone retreat!&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ah, yes.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">The leader&apos;s orders were absolute. His subordinate didn&apos;t dispute Ichni&apos;s orders. &#xA0;He instructed everyone to retreat. Since there were a lot of Users gathered here, the retreat didn&apos;t just occur from speaking just one or two words. &#xA0;They wasted some time telling everyone of the retreat order.</span></p><p><span style="">In reality, it wasn&apos;t a lot of time. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">It took them around 10 seconds, but...</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Huhk!&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">Ichni&apos;s subordinate was passing down the order when the knight that had been far away came into view.</span></p><p><span style="">It didn&apos;t feel as if the knight had approached him. &#xA0;It was as if the knight had disappeared, and it just appeared right in front of his eyes.</span></p><p><span style="">Moreover, the knight had his sword raised up high, and the sword was already descending when the Ichni&apos;s subordinate realized the knight was there.</span></p><p><span style="">Kahng! </span></p><p><span style="">Fortunately, Ichni raised his spear to block the sword strike. &#xA0;His subordinate stumbled backward in fright.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Just ignore me! &#xA0;Evacuate!&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Ichni encouraged his subordinate to run away. &#xA0;His subordinate wordlessly got out of there quickly. </span></p><p><span style="">The knight was right in front of his eyes, so Ichni was finally able to get a good look at the knight in front of him. &#xA0;While they were in close &#xA0;proximity to each other, Ichni could see the milky white eyes flash from within its helmet.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Isn&apos;t he the left hand of Prince Dean? &#xA0;It&apos;s sir Argardo.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">After a brief moment, he sized up the situation.</span></p><p><span style="">Ggee-eek, ggee-eek! </span></p><p><span style="">The shaft of Ichni&apos;s spear was starting to be cut incrementally as it blocked Argardo&apos;s sword. &#xA0;It wasn&apos;t as if the sword was making a sawing motion. &#xA0;This was occurring just from having the sword pressing firmly against the shaft. </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Coating!&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Ichni reflexively used his Skill.</span></p><p><span style="">The Skill he used was called Coating. For a limited amount of time, the skill made it impossible for one&apos;s weapon and armor to be destroyed. &#xA0;It was a Unique Skill, and it wasn&apos;t easy to acquire.</span></p><p><span style="">Since it wasn&apos;t easy to acquire, this meant the effectiveness of the skill was certain.</span></p><p><span style="">However, Ichni had took his eyes off his opponent to use the skill. &#xA0;At that moment, Argardo kicked Ichni in the stomach. </span></p><p><span style="">Ggwah-roong!</span></p><p><span style="">The impact caused a sound that was akin to a thunder clap. Ichni&apos;s body flew away like stone skipping across the surface of a lake. &#xA0;He was sent roughly skipping across the ground.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Ffffuuuuuuuhhhhck!&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">His world was spinning at that moment.</span></p><p><span style="">In the extremely chaotic situation, Ichni came to a stop, and he looked in front of him.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Where is he?&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">Argardo wasn&apos;t in his field of vision. Ichni had a small hunch. &#xA0;He raised his head slightly to look up. &#xA0;Ichni was finally able to see Argardo.</span></p><p><span style="">Poohk! </span></p><p><span style="">Argardo&apos;s sword skewered Ichni&apos;s head.</span></p><p><span style="">- Ooh-ahk. He became a roadkill.</span></p><p><span style="">- Spearman Ichni couldn&apos;t even last a minute.</span></p><p><span style="">- Isn&apos;t that the Sweeper guild&apos;s Raid Team? In truth, the result was to be expected.</span></p><p><span style="">- Sweepers guild mainly deal with clearing monsters. &#xA0;Their Raid team can&apos;t even crack the Top 10 in terms of power. &#xA0;Still, this was way too one-sided.</span></p><p><span style="">The White-eyed knight sir Argardo.</span></p><p><span style="">He was called the left hand of Prince Dean. &#xA0;After the Sweepers guild acquired the rights to the Raid, they immediately broadcasted the raid live.</span></p><p><span style="">A significant number of people purchased the live ticket, and the ripple caused by what had happened on live broadcast was seen in the comments section.</span></p><p><span style="">Shir read the responses, and she turned her head. &#xA0;Hatch was watching the same broadcast, and he spoke when he felt her gaze on him.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Do you have a question for me?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What are your thoughts on what just happened?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Do you want my opinion on Argardo or the Sweepers guild?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Both.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">The answer came from a different source.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;If the Queen and I fight him, that NPC will be beaten to a pulp within 10 minutes! &#xA0;In the first place, the Sweepers guild was out of their minds if they thought they could deal with...&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hey! Filter your words! &#xA0;Chose your words more carefully!&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Storm Princess Hahui was about to say the Sweepers guild was trying eat something that was out of their reach. &#xA0;However, Hatch cut her off.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Does that mouth say anything it wants?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What did you just say?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Hahui glared at Hatch. &#xA0;However, Hatch justly ignored Hahui. &#xA0;He spoke to Shir.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;We checked up on it, and Skills won&apos;t work on it. &#xA0;It isn&apos;t affected by physical attacks and magical attacks. &#xA0;It might be the armor, but on the other hand, it could be some unknown skill granted to it by the Corrupted power. &#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">The White-eyed knight sir Argardo.</span></p><p><span style="">The information about this NPC was pretty widespread. &#xA0;Amongst the NPC knights in Warlord, it was considered to be in the top 10. &#xA0;Of course, when the Immoral Prince was revealed to be Prince Dean, the battle with Argardo was inevitable.</span></p><p><span style="">It was a matter of when, where and how. &#xA0;It was going to happen eventually.</span></p><p><span style="">Now everyone was aware of this fact.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;How is it compared to the Corrupted Count?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;In an RPG game, the goblin that appears later in the game is much stronger then the dragon from the early portions of the game. &#xA0;They aren&apos;t even comparable.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Give me a more detailed explanation.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;The knight&apos;s close combat ability is on a whole different level compared to the monsters we&apos;ve faced until now. &#xA0;Do you mind if I speak a little bit more bluntly?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Speak.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;In my opinion, the knight is better than the Queen.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;You want to die?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Hahui once again interrupted the conversation. </span></p><p><span style="">Hatch let out a sigh. </span></p><p><span style="">He had on an expression that said, &apos;What do I have to do to make this bitch shut up?&apos;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What evidence do you have?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Shir glanced at Hahui. &#xA0;Hahui clamped her mouth shut, and at the same time, she pouted.</span></p><p><span style="">After seeing this, Hatch immediately opened his mouth.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;When facing this enemy, experience in PVP is much more important than Raid experience. &#xA0;This is the Queen&apos;s weakness.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Shir nodded her head</span></p><p><span style="">It was true. &#xA0;Shir was also strong at PVP. There weren&apos;t that many people, who she considered to be her peer. &#xA0;In a one on one fight, the number of Users that could confidently beat her could be counted on the fingers of her hand. &#xA0;This was the case even if she searched through the entire User base of Warlord.</span></p><p><span style="">However, this didn&apos;t mean she had a lot of experience of fighting one on one battles. In the first place, how many Users would try to PK her? &#xA0;Even if one wanted to PK her, one would be cut down before one could even reach her.</span></p><p><span style="">Of course, this wasn&apos;t a weakness that was only present in Shir.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;The problem is this weakness is present in most of the Strikers representing the 30 great guilds.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">The 30 great guild&#x2019;s primary raid teams were mainly made out of Strikers. &#xA0;They were called the stars of Warlord, and it was almost impossible for the normal Users to even meet them. &#xA0;In other words, these particular Users had never had any harrowing experiences.</span></p><p><span style="">There was a lack of PVP experience, yet the battle with Argardo required competence in PVP. Even if one put aside the disparity in number, the outcome of this battle was hard to predict. &#xA0;The Sweepers guild had deployed &#xA0;their massive bombardment of magic skills, yet it hadn&#x2019;t worked at all.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;If we can catch this bastard, the game will be set.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Argardo was the perfect trophy. &#xA0;The guild that kills it would be called the best for a good amount of time.</span></p><p><span style="">Hatch nodded his head. &#xA0;There was a very slim chance for success, but they couldn&apos;t avoid the battle with Argardo. &#xA0;If one did avoid it, it would damage one&apos;s reputation more so than losing to Argardo.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I&apos;ll go apply for the raid. We&apos;ll be in the back of the queue, but we won&apos;t have to worry about the order of queue.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">When Argardo was taken down, there would only be one thing left afterwards.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Then we&apos;ll get ready for the Immoral Prince raid.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">When one era comes to an end, one had to get ready for the new era.</span></p>
