<p><span style="">Chapter 123 - Power of Wealth (1)</span></p><p>1.</p><p><span style="">There used to be a saying in the great battle that said the tail had the best flavor. If the best tasting part of a fish was its head, the best tasting part of the great battle was the tail.</span></p><p><span style="">When the Corrupted army went into Siege mode, the Corrupted army became very reckless. &#xA0;They charged forward no matter what. &#xA0;Even if outside interference arrived, the monsters that were directly affected would be the only ones to react. &#xA0;The rest of the monsters didn&apos;t stop their charge.</span></p><p><span style="">Even the monsters that had reacted returned to their charge as soon as their aggro was reset in a short order. If a Tanker succeeded in drawing aggro, the monster would start attacking, then suddenly it would just run past the Tanker to charge the castle.</span></p><p><span style="">This special characteristic was put in, so that the Users couldn&apos;t break up the Corrupted army using the Aggro system. &#xA0;However, every advantage also had its disadvantage. &#xA0;The Gnawing method was a strategy that turned the advantage of the Corrupted army into a disadvantage. &#xA0;One was able to approach the Corrupted army from the side, and the monsters were picked off one by one.</span></p><p><span style="">This was where the expression the tail has the best flavor originated. &#xA0;After the know how to the Gnawing method was revealed, all the Users started to pound the Corrupted army from the side. &#xA0;In many cases, there were more Users dispatched to the side than the front. Naturally, the competition in Gnawing the Corrupted army became fierce.</span></p><p><span style="">At that moment, several Users had an idea.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Hey. &#xA0;Instead of the side, how about eating them from the rear?&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;All right.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">There were no spots open from the sides. If one took position in the front, there was the danger of being run over by the Corrupt army.</span></p><p><span style="">Let&apos;s attack the tail!</span></p><p><span style="">The result was a jackpot.</span></p><p><span style="">The biggest advantage of Eating the Tail was the fact that there was a very low probability of the Corrupted army coming to a stop and surrounding the Users. &#xA0;If one faced the Corrupted army head on, it didn&apos;t matter if one could be surrounded. &#xA0;A simple lapse in concentration would result in one being trampled. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">The Gnawing from the side had a lower chance of being surrounded compared to the front, but it wasn&apos;t as if it didn&apos;t happen.</span></p><p><span style="">However, it was impossible to be surrounded using the Eat the Tail method. &#xA0;It couldn&apos;t happen unless one throws one&apos;s body into the midst of the Corrupted army.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;I&apos;ve laid out all my cards now.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">In other words, Hyrkan had no more tips to give after the Eat the Tail method. &#xA0;He had given away the Congestion method, Street Battle strategy, Gnawing method and now the Eat the Tail method. &#xA0;There might be some very mysterious and marvelous method to attack the Corrupted army, but Hyrkan&apos;s brain couldn&apos;t come up with any.</span></p><p><span style="">Since he already revealed the Eat the Tail method, Hyrkan had to do something monumental.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;I&apos;ll finish this great battle using any means possible by myself.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">There would be nothing more monumental than winning this battle.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;After I end this, I have to encourage the 30 great guilds to participate....&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">When Hyrkan ruminated over his plan, Hyrkan suddenly started kicking at the ground like a crazy person.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ooh-ah-ah-ah!&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Even a bizarre sound escaped from Hyrkan&apos;s mouth. &#xA0;No matter who saw this they would think he had lost his mind.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Why do I have to spend so much money because of those 30 great guilds? Why do I have to do such bullshit...&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">Of course, it was an understandable reaction to the situation.</span></p><p><span style="">If Hyrkan&apos;s plan ended in success, the ones who&apos;ll benefit would be the 30 great guilds. &#xA0;The goal of his plan was to push the 30 great guilds into participating in the great battle.</span></p><p><span style="">There was no other way to do this. &#xA0;The activities of the Underfoot guilds, and the know how revealed by Hyrkan made the situation a little bit better. &#xA0;However, they couldn&apos;t completely turn the tide of the war. &#xA0;Moreover, the defending of the castles wasn&apos;t the only task they had to accomplish. &#xA0;They had to take back the castles they had lost.</span></p><p><span style="">If Hyrkan had 30 bodies then it wouldn&apos;t be a problem. &#xA0;However, there was a limit on what he could do himself.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Shit!&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Still, he couldn&apos;t help, but get mad.</span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan had been busy abusing the ground, and an unlucky rock got caught in one of his kicks. The large rock was as big as a fist of a grown man, and it flew high into the air. &#xA0;It flew in a large arc, and it impacted hard against the helmet worn by a monster in the rear of the Corrupted army.</span></p><p><span style="">The sudden impact of the rock made the monster look around its surrounding before it kept on charging with its comrades.</span></p><p><span style="">When Hyrkan saw this, he couldn&apos;t help laughing. &#xA0;Hyrkan turned his gaze on the Skeleton Warriors holding big sacks.</span></p><p></p><p><span style="">2.</span></p><p><span style="">[There&apos;s 1 hour 59 minutes 59 seconds before the Corrupted army arrives at the Shezga castle.] </span></p><p><span style="">When the announcement alerting the appearance of the Corrupted army was put up, the 1000 Users in the Shezga castle started to move busily.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Let&apos;s move to our assigned districts!&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Take all your Items and don&apos;t get confused on which district you are supposed to be in!&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">The Centurions and the groups that were assigned to them moved towards the assigned districts. &#xA0;This was a tactic that had been popularized recently in the great battle. &#xA0;The Users realized it was useless to create a battle line with all the Tankers standing side by side. It was better to create a group of 100, and these groups could defend an assigned region.</span></p><p><span style="">This made more sense since the Users here wasn&apos;t planning on defending the castle.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Let&apos;s catch a lot of them today!&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Dont&apos; over do it. &#xA0;We just need to gain some EXP. We just have to catch the monsters that come into the the castle.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">All the Users here had gathered to take advantage of the hunting ground that would give a good amount of EXP. &#xA0;That was no other reasons for being here.</span></p><p><span style="">While the groups were busily moving to their assigned sectors, Big K stood on top of the the castle wall. &#xA0;He was watching something far away instead of going to his sector. A fellow Red Bulls guild member named Yangchio saw Big K standing on top of the castle wall. &#xA0;He approached Big K as Yangchio asked him a question.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What are you looking at? &#xA0;We have to move.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hahoe Mask.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Yangchio was surprised by Big K&apos;s sudden answer, so he followed Big K&apos;s gaze.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Where is the Hahoe Mask?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">However, he couldn&apos;t see anything at the location where Big K was staring at. No, there was something there. It was pretty far away, but a cloud of dust and birds were rising above the treetops.</span></p><p><span style="">The trees were being overturned by the advance of the Corrupted Army. &#xA0;The wild animals that had used the trees as their home were running away, and they were causing a chaotic scene.</span></p><p><span style="">Of course, the Hahoe Mask still couldn&apos;t be seen. Moreover, the distance was too far to see the Hahoe Mask with the naked eye.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Where are you looking at? &#xA0;Where&apos;s the Hahoe Mask?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Yangchio spoke in a sullen manner. &#xA0;He thought Big K had duped him.</span></p><p><span style="">However, Big K wasn&apos;t trying to deceive Yangchio at all. Big K couldn&apos;t see him, but he couldn&apos;t deduce where the Hahoe Mask was located at.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Look at the rear.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Rear?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;He is behind the advancing Corrupted army. The Hahoe Mask does not go back on his words. He&apos;ll be where he said he&apos;ll be.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Yangchio clicked his tongue at Big K&apos;s answer. &#xA0;He couldn&apos;t understand Big K&apos;s behavior. They didn&apos;t have any reason to worry about the Hahoe Mask now. &#xA0;Wasn&apos;t it more important to pay attention to the task at hand?</span></p><p><span style="">Big K understood the Yangchio&#x2019;s reaction, but he didn&#x2019;t refused to change the topic. &#xA0;He continued on speaking.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What if the Hahoe Mask does what he said he would do? &#xA0;What would happen if he engineered a victory in this great battle?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Poo-hah-ha!&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Instead of an answer, Yangchio let out an explosive laugh. &#xA0;His laughter was a more sure answer than his words. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;You don&apos;t have to worry about such a thing happening, Big K. &#xA0;The Hahoe Mask is a nutjob. &#xA0;The nutjob has nothing to do with us. &#xA0;Moreover, even if Hahoe Mask is amazing, what can he do by himself? &#xA0;Victory? That isn&#x2019;t even funny. &#xA0;There is no way the Users gathered here could defend the castle.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Yangchio patted Big K&apos;s shoulder. &#xA0;It was a nonverbal signal asking Big K to stop speaking of such nonsense.</span></p><p><span style="">Big K closed his mouth after receiving the signal. &#xA0;However, he continued to look towards a location beyond the Corrupted army.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Hahoe Mask&apos;s plan was simple.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">The plan spoken by the Hahoe Mask wasn&#x2019;t difficult to comprehend. &#xA0;While the Hahoe Mask focused on the tail of the Corrupted army, the rest of the Users gathered here would fight with the castle wall in front of them. Then a portion of their forces would attempt the Gnawing method. &#xA0;This was the entirety of the plan revealed by the Hahoe Mask.</span></p><p><span style="">The Corrupted army would become congested as it tried to squeeze through a small door. &#xA0;While this phenomenon was happening, the Users would surround the Corrupted army, and they would chip away at the horde.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;The plan proposed by the Hahoe Mask can be done.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">It wouldn&apos;t be too difficult. He didn&#x2019;t know if it would result in victory, but &#xA0;he could carry out the plan. &#xA0;However, there was no good reason to follow the Hahoe Mask&#x2019;s word right now.</span></p><p><span style="">No Users would follow the plan just because the Hahoe Mask came up with it.</span></p><p><span style="">Most of the Users would resent Hyrkan for ordering them around.</span></p><p><span style="">If the Hahoe Mask really wanted to do things his way, he need to develop an aura that drew people in through his deeds. This aura was what allowed Fighters guild&#x2019;s Whistling Pitbull to be able to lead others into victory.</span></p><p><span style="">This part was what worried Big K about the Hahoe Mask.</span></p><p><span style="">There were many things said about the Hahoe Mask, but no one denied the Hahoe Mask had a great aura. </span></p><p><span style="">Was he willing to bet that the Hahoe Mask would be able to reveal such an aura here?</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Should I really just ignore the Hahoe Mask? &#xA0;Is that the right answer? &#xA0;What if we can really defend the castle? &#xA0;Was following the Hahoe Mask the right answer?&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">It happened when Big K was deep within his thoughts.</span></p><p><span style="">Kwahng! </span></p><p><span style="">The battle started as a sound of an explosion was heard from the rear of the Corrupted army.</span></p><p>3.</p><p><span style="">The Corrupted army had entered into its Siege mode. &#xA0;Hyrkan was tailing them, and Hyrkan saw a pretty awesome sight in front of him.</span></p><p><span style="">Various monsters were in full armor, and they were marching in line as they advanced. &#xA0;They looked dignified, and every time they took a step the ground shook. &#xA0;They unhesitatingly trampled any vegetation in their way as they left behind traces of their passage.</span></p><p><span style="">This was something that couldn&apos;t be seen anywhere else. It was a magnificent sight that could only be seen in the great battle.</span></p><p><span style="">He was going to do something to this magnificent sight. &#xA0;It almost felt like he was throwing muddy water at a famous painting.</span></p><p><span style="">However, he didn&apos;t hesitate as he threw the muddy water at the magnificent sight. &#xA0;He threw something that was akin to throwing a huge amount of muddy water.</span></p><p><span style="">Kwahng! </span></p><p><span style="">A Bone Explosive was thrown by Hyrkan, and a big explosion occurred when it impacted on the helm of a Corrupted Armor Troll. The power of the blast was considerable. &#xA0;It was strong enough to dent the Corrupted Armor Troll&apos;s helmet. &#xA0;On top of that, the fragments from the Bone Explosive splattered onto the surrounding monsters.</span></p><p><span style="">However, the only one displaying hostility towards Hyrkan was the one that had received the direct attack.</span></p><p><span style="">Koo-uh-uh! </span></p><p><span style="">It jumped out from the horde as it started charging after Hyrkan. Hyrkan didn&apos;t try to dodge its charge. Instead, he threw more Bone Explosives. &#xA0;He hadn&apos;t just thrown one.</span></p><p><span style="">Kwah-ahng, kwah-gwah, kwahng! </span></p><p><span style="">He threw a handful. </span></p><p><span style="">To be precise, he had thrown four Bone Explosives at once. &#xA0;The simultaneous explosion of the four explosives generated considerable amount of force. &#xA0;The Corrupted Armor Troll stopped in its track for a moment, and one could see several places on the armor where it had take significant damage. &#xA0;If this were normal times, he would have tried Armor Breaking first, then he would have used the Bone Explosives to do the damage dealing.</span></p><p><span style="">He could still use that method right now. &#xA0;It was still an efficient way to defeat a monster. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">However, he had a method where he could destroy the armor much faster.</span></p><p><span style="">The problem was money! </span></p><p><span style="">If he used his Bone Explosives this way, he would never gain any profits. &#xA0;He wouldn&apos;t even have to worry about profits. &#xA0;Every monster he caught would put him in the negative.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Ooh ooh. &#xA0;My money&#x2026;&#x2026;.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">Of course, this style of attack had a bigger impact on Hyrkan more so than than the monster being attacked. He had already thrown five Bone Explosives, and it made Hyrkan shudder. </span></p><p><span style="">However, Hyrkan gritted his teeth as his body shuddered, and he threw another Bone Explosive.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;I can&apos;t take more than 2 minutes to catch one monster.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">He had to decrease the time it took to kill the monsters.</span></p><p><span style="">If Hyrkan did an Armor Breaking against the Corrupted Monster and he battled the Corrupted Monster with the Skeleton Warriors and Knights, it would take him about 3 to 5 minutes to take one down. &#xA0;It was an incredible feat. &#xA0;He was taking it down faster than what a 5 man party could do.</span></p><p><span style="">The problem arose when he did the math. &#xA0;At the very least, it would take him 300 minutes to catch 100 Corrupted Monsters. &#xA0;It&apos;ll take over 5 hours. </span></p><p><span style="">He couldn&apos;t fight like that. &#xA0;He didn&apos;t have the time. &#xA0;Moreover, it was impossible for him to maintain his concentration for so long. In Hyrkan&apos;s case, he would have to perform the Eat the Tail method to start off the war then he would have to fight in battle in earnest. &#xA0;Afterwards, he might also have to fight in the street battles too.</span></p><p><span style="">This was why Hyrkan was trying to lessen the time he spent here using money. &#xA0;He had brought a large amount of Bone Explosives. &#xA0;The two Skeletons had been carrying the bags, and it was filled with Bone Explosives.</span></p><p><span style="">He hadn&apos;t calculated the cost yet. If he knew the figure, Hyrkan felt like his heart would have crumbled.</span></p><p><span style="">However, this wasn&#x2019;t the end.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ughh.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan let out a moan as he flicked his finger. &#xA0;As if the Skeleton Warriors had &#xA0;been on standby, they ran in towards the Troll. &#xA0;Every one of the Skeleton Warriors held a hammer.</span></p><p><span style="">He&apos;ll damage the armor with the Bone Explosives, and the hammers would be used to destroy the armor! </span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan had purchased these new Items to pull off this tactic. &#xA0;The amount he had spent wasn&apos;t small.</span></p><p><span style="">Ggah-ahng, ggah-ahng! </span></p><p><span style="">This method did the job in no uncertain terms. As soon as the combat started, the Skeleton Warriors tirelessly bashed their hammers against the Troll&apos;s armor. Unlike the Skeleton Warriors, the club swung by the Troll didn&apos;t hit anything.</span></p><p><span style="">The Troll&apos;s armors were crushed in a horrible fashion, and at some point, the armor parts started falling to the ground one after another.</span></p><p><span style="">However, Hyrkan wasn&apos;t watching this sight anymore. &#xA0;Hyrkan was already chasing after the Corrupted army, which had traveled a fair distance away from him. &#xA0;When he closed in on them, he threw a Bone Explosive at a new target.</span></p><p><span style="">If he wanted to catch them quickly, he had to kill several at a time. &#xA0;However, he had to attack each individual monsters to draw their aggro. &#xA0;If put in terms Hyrkan could understand, it meant he had to spend more money.</span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan bit his lip hard. </span></p><p><span style="">At the same time, Hyrkan squeezed his fist. &#xA0;Sparkling liquid started dripping from his clenched fist to the ground.</span></p><p><span style="">When the liquid started to pool, the ground started to shift, and an enormous wolf appeared. &#xA0;It was a striking looking wolf with four knife-like canines. &#xA0;It was a Blade Wolf.</span></p><p><span style="">It was a level 140 mid-sized monster. &#xA0;It was rated as being one of the strongest &#xA0;amongst the Boss Monsters with similar size and level. &#xA0;At the same time, it was a very expensive monster. &#xA0;He had used the gem from a monster of that caliber as a sacrifice for the Clay Play. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">However, the Wolf Golem that had appeared was worth its price. &#xA0;It didn&apos;t even bother with Armor Breaking. &#xA0;It immediately pounced on the Corrupted Armor Orc, and it bit off flesh and armor in a flash. &#xA0;The Corrupted Armor Orc counter-attacked, and it was able to wound the Wolf Golem. &#xA0;However, the Golem&apos;s wound was immediately patched up using Hyrkan&apos;s Magic Power.</span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan didn&apos;t pay attention to the battle. &#xA0;Hyrkan once again threw a Bone Explosive towards the third target.</span></p><p><span style="">This time the Skeleton Knight stepped forward. &#xA0;At a glance, one could tell the Skeleton Knight was equipped with expensive defensive gears. When the Bone Armor was summoned, its body became several times larger. The Madness Helm was the finishing touch.</span></p><p><span style="">After receiving all the Buffs, the Skeleton Knight started to move in a frenzy. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">It almost made one feel sorry for the Corrupted Lizardman, who was facing off against the Skeleton Knight. </span></p><p><span style="">Once again Hyrkan couldn&apos;t stay to see the battle.</span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan reached to the big bag by his side, and he took out a Bone Explosive. &#xA0;He threw it towards the 4th target. During all of this, the Skeleton Warriors had finished their battle, and they had arrived near the vicinity of Hyrkan. &#xA0;They waited for Hyrkan&apos;s attack order, and the appearance of a new prey. </span></p><p><span style="">Blitzkrieg! </span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan was quickly reducing the number of monsters in the Corrupted Army with surprising speed.</span></p><p><span style="">At the same time...</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ooh haha! Eat these money bombs!&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">The threads holding together his sanity was slowly being eaten away.</span></p>
