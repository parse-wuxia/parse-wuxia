<p>Chapter 171 &#x2013; Bone Dragon (1)</p><p>1.</p><p><span style="">&#x201C;All right. &#xA0;I&apos;ll do that. &#xA0;I&apos;ll trade you a full Blood Ogre set and the Ingredients needed to make 3 Werebear Items. &#xA0;Do you want me to go to a different seller? &#xA0;Wait a moment. &#xA0;How much are you trying to get for that Item? &#xA0;If we are close, let&apos;s consummate this trade. The Werebear drop Items haven&apos;t been released on the market yet.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Ahn-jaehyun used his index finger to reposition his glasses as he spoke. &#xA0;He lightly pushed up the nose pad of the glass, which had fallen to the bridge of his nose. &#xA0;As if a switch had been pressed, a furrow appeared on Ahn-jaheyun&apos;s forehead.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Please stop playing around. &#xA0;I called you to make a trade, yet you have the audacity to change the terms mid-call. &#xA0;That isn&apos;t good manners.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">A sharp voice, which went well with his frowning face, came out his mouth.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;How about the Black Kobold King&apos;s sword? &#xA0;It&apos;s price has dropped recently, but you should know it can&apos;t be purchased with a small sum. &#xA0;Anyways, that is my final offer for it..&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">In the end, the earphone equipped on Ahn-jaehyun&apos;s left ear buzzed.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ok. &#xA0;Let&apos;s do this trade.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">After finishing the trade, Ahn-jaehyun immediately took off the earphone, and he threw it towards the mattress in anger. </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Fucking asshole!&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Accompanying the profane language, Ahn-jaehyun seethed within.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;He is really acting high and mighty just from owning a level 190 No Name Skill Book. &#xA0;He is trying to take me to the cleaners! &#xA0;Fucking asshole!&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">The level 190 No Name Skill Books were starting to trickle out in the market. &#xA0;Even the ridiculous price on the auction board was starting to fall drastically. &#xA0;In such a situation, Ahn-jaehyun had a good idea what the market price was for a level 190 No Name Skill book. &#xA0;This was why he suggested an Item exchange to the seller.</span></p><p><span style="">Ahn-jaehyun had decided to get rid of the Items not needed by the Skeleton Warriors. &#xA0;His Skeleton Warriors didn&apos;t need it, but these Items were still popular amongst the Users. &#xA0;It was good enough to be used as bartering chips.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;The Item Option dropped by the Werebear is pretty atrocious compared to the hunting difficulty, yet it is a level 220 Item....&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">He had planned on using only the Items he didn&apos;t need as bartering chips, but once the negotiation started, he had to include the Item Ingredients dropped by the Werebears. </span></p><p><span style="">Ahn-jaehyun grinded his teeth.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;I&apos;m not talented at trading Items. It should have been equal value... &#xA0;It&apos;s all right. &#xA0;It&apos;s fine.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">It was an unexpected trade, but he didn&apos;t need any of the Items that was used as bartering chips. &#xA0;The only problem was the gold he could have gotten by selling these Items.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;I must have lost my mind.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">Ahn-jaehyun became astonished as he balanced his account.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;It is only a single Skill, yet I spent so much.... &#xA0;I&apos;ve lost my mind. &#xA0;I&apos;m sure of it.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">It was only a single skill. &#xA0;Moreover, he had no idea which Skill might come out of it, yet he had bought it for an incredible amount of money. &#xA0;It was something the original Rich Lich, Subrata Duta, would have done. &#xA0;It was something only an incredibly rich man would do.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Or maybe this game is crazy.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">Ahn-jaehyun looked at the V-Gear on the mattress.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;This game is really nuts. &#xA0;Warlord is a well made game, but the other games don&apos;t ramp up like this.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">After Warlord&apos;s great success, many games were released to take over the throne held by Warlord, and there were several games vying for that spot. There had to be a basic sense of completeness for one to enjoy these kinds of games, and there were several games that were able to compete with Warlord by fulfilling this prerequisite. &#xA0;Moreover, there were some aspects of these games that were superior to Warlord. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">These games weren&apos;t able to increase their base population as quickly as Warlord, but they were successful in getting a large following. &#xA0;However, none of these games could reach a point where ridiculous money was being exchanged within. &#xA0;There weren&apos;t any games where people went crazy over it.</span></p><p><span style="">Moreover, there will be none that would be able to capture the heart of the people in the future. &#xA0;Before Ahn-jaehyun came back to the past, Warlord had been considered a special game. &#xA0;It reigned over all games as the special one. &#xA0;There was an indescribable quality that existed within Warlord.</span></p><p><span style="">When he thought about the past, he couldn&apos;t help, but sneer at himself.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;The craziness right now is to my advantage. &#xA0;&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">Before he returned to the past, this specialness of Warlord had been a pain for him. &#xA0;However, it was the opposite now. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">Warlord was special, and the Hahoe Mask was special within Warlord. &#xA0;Ahn-jaehyun was doing unimaginable feats now.</span></p><p><span style="">Moreover, he would achieve greater feats in the future.</span></p><p><span style="">Ahn-jaehyun lay dowy down on his mattress, and he immediately put on his V-Gear.</span></p><p>2.</p><p><span style="">It took over 20 days for Hyrkan to finish his Quest. &#xA0;When he returned to the Heard Fortress ruin town, it had developed a decent amount. &#xA0;It was hard to call it a town now. &#xA0;It was starting to resemble a castle.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;It looks similar to the Cursed Castle.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">The transformation of the Heard Fortress ruin town was something he had seen before at the Cursed Castle. &#xA0;It was like the Cursed Castle regaining its name of Hiban castle, and the dignity that came with the process. &#xA0;Of course, there were several differences one could point out.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Shouldn&#x2019;t they be making a statue of me here?&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">However, the most important difference in Hyrkan&apos;s mind was the absence of a statue.</span></p><p><span style="">When the Cursed Statue transformed into the Hiban castle, the game erected a statue for the Noopi Family. &#xA0;The Heard Fortress ruin town was able to be established when Hyrkan had defeated Anugas. &#xA0;However, the game was showing no signs of erecting a statue for the Hahoe Mask.</span></p><p><span style="">Of course, he wouldn&apos;t get any monetary gain from the formation of a statue. &#xA0;However, if they insisted on building one, he wouldn&apos;t turn down the opportunity. &#xA0;There was no reason why he would hate the idea.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Tsk.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">He actually welcomed such gestures. &#xA0;He really liked the idea of leaving behind a permanent presence in this game.</span></p><p><span style="">Since he liked the idea, he felt a sense of disappointment.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;They should have made me a park. &#xA0;How great would it have been if they erected a statue of me fighting Anugas? &#xA0;It would have looked cool and awesome.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">The Users, who were focused on Hyrkan&apos;s presence in the town, would have fainted if they found out about his inner thoughts.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hahoe Mask! &#xA0;Isn&apos;t that the Hahoe Mask.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Of course, it is the Hahoe Mask. &#xA0;No one would pretend to be the Hahoe Mask in the Black Continent. &#xA0;It would be the end for those, who were caught.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I heard five Users spying on him had their wrists cut off. &#xA0;I heard the hands were fed to the Skeletons.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;How gruesome.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Is that the famous Watchman style? &#xA0;It is scary.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">The Hahoe Mask was the symbol of fear on the stage of Warlord. &#xA0;The Hahoe Mask didn&apos;t stand for hope and dream. Hahoe mask was known for taking out monsters and Users, who annoyed him. &#xA0;Even if it was a normal User, he was know to be ruthless if you mess with him.</span></p><p><span style="">The terrifying Hahoe Mask was mumbling about why the Warlord System wasn&apos;t building him a statue. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">Who would have imagined such a thing?</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Ah, I want a statue of myself.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan left behind the nervous crowd as he headed towards the Subjugation Association.</span></p><p>3.</p><p><span style="">In the Subjugation Association within the Heard Fortress ruin town, there was a stairway leading connecting the 3rd floor to the 4th floor. &#xA0;This was a stairway rarely used by Users and NPC, yet someone was using this stairway as a chair. &#xA0;He had a book open in his hands, and another book was placed next to him.</span></p><p><span style="">The identity of the User was Hyrkan, and the book was a Skill Book.</span></p><p><span style="">[The Skill Book has revealed itself.] </span></p><p><span style="">[Will you like to learn the Piercing Pocket Skill?] </span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan had spent a significant capital in buy this level 190 No Name Skill Book, and the Skill turned out to be the Piercing Pocket.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Oh!&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan was satisfied with the result.</span></p><p><span style="">In many ways, this Skill suited Hyrkan the most.</span></p><p><span style="">[You&apos;ve learned the Piercing Pocket Skill.] </span></p><p><span style="">[Piercing Pocket] </span></p><p><span style="">- Proficiency N/A</span></p><p><span style="">- Skill Description : You will be able to make space in your body. &#xA0;The only storage space once cannot open is at the head and chest.</span></p><p><span style="">It was as the Skill description said. &#xA0;The Piercing Pocket Skill&apos;s effect allowed him to use his body as a pocket or a bag. &#xA0;He&apos;ll be able to carry much more Items than before, and he didn&apos;t have to worry about losing them.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Oh right. &#xA0;I&apos;m a Lich now.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">He was only able to learn this Skill, because he was a Lich.</span></p><p><span style="">His body was set up as that of a Lich. When he learned the Life Vessel skill, he had basically become an Undead. &#xA0;He was immune to Abnormal Status like bleeding. &#xA0;On the other hand, Healing type Skills couldn&apos;t be used on him. Moreover, the attacks that work against Undead monsters were effective against him too. &#xA0;He was treated like an Undead monster in the game. </span></p><p><span style="">His naked body was also different from the normal Users. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">Like the normal Users, he always had his armor on, so no one knew about it. &#xA0;However, Hyrkan&apos;s Skin color was patchy since he had used the Skin Sewing Skill. &#xA0;A hairy hide was sewn onto his left arm, and his right arm was covered with scale-like skin he took from a reptile. &#xA0;He couldn&apos;t display his Steel Bones, but his bones were also different from the normal Users. &#xA0;Then there were the black tattoos placed all over his body.</span></p><p><span style="">He had such an abnormal body, yet it was about to become something akin to a drawer. &#xA0;Users would think him crazy for doing this.</span></p><p><span style="">Even for people who pierced and tattooed their entire body would think he was abnormal.</span></p><p><span style="">However, Hyrkan was satisfied with this fact.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;If I peel back the skin over my stomach to reveal a slot full of magic recovery candy... &#xA0;Wouldn&apos;t I be like Doraemon? &#xA0;It&apos;ll be awesome. &#xA0;Wait a sec. &#xA0;Will my belly button be used as a handle? &#xA0;What should I do about the handle?&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">All these Skills made his outer appearance look unsightly, but they were the proof of his strength.</span></p><p><span style="">The passive effects that arose from the Skin Sewing and the Black Tattoos allowed him to be as strong as the Swordsman Class. &#xA0;Moreover, Skills like Steel Bones allowed him to have strong defense.</span></p><p><span style="">Since he would never hunt with a Priest, these Skills were a boon to him.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Well, I should now....&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan immediately took the second Skill Book into his hands. &#xA0;This was the Skill Book he received as a reward for the Archmage Bokan Quest. &#xA0;He didn&apos;t know the level of the Skill Book, and he also didn&apos;t know what Skill it would give.</span></p><p><span style="">It was time for him to find out.</span></p><p><span style="">Depending on what came out of the Skill Book, he would have to resolve his next dilemma.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;I have to decide if I should use the Legendary Rank Ancient Power to reinforce this new Skill.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">After passing the Ancient King&apos;s test, he had opened up the body of the fallen Guardian Knights. &#xA0;Their bodies were like vaults, and he had found two boxes within. &#xA0;One was a black box, and the other was a red box. &#xA0;The black box had a black scroll for the Transcendent Rank Ancient Power. The red box held a red scroll for the Legendary Rank Ancient Power.</span></p><p><span style="">His dilemma started there.</span></p><p><span style="">The Transcendent Rank Ancient Power increased the performance of a Skill. &#xA0;He didn&apos;t really have to worry about where to use this one.</span></p><p><span style="">However, the Legendary Rank Ancient Power changed the nature of a Skill. &#xA0;For example, if one used the Transcendent Rank Ancient Power on the Skeleton Fragment Skill, the Skeleton Warrior&apos;s stats and the number of Skeletons able to be summoned would be increased. &#xA0;On the other hand, if one used the Legendary Rank Ancient Power, a monster&apos;s bone could be used to summon non-bipedal Skeleton Warriors. &#xA0;Therefore, one could use a wolf&apos;s bone instead of a werewolf&apos;s bone to summon the Skeleton Warriors.</span></p><p><span style="">This was why he was struggling over the decision.</span></p><p><span style="">The Legendary Rank Ancient Power was incredibly hard to acquire. &#xA0;One had to put in 10 times the effort of acquiring a Transcendent Rank Ancient Power to gain the Legendary Rank Ancient Power.</span></p><p><span style="">However, the use of the Skill Enhancement didn&apos;t always end as a net positive.</span></p><p><span style="">To put it simply, it was good to reinforce a skill that was used as often as the Skeleton Fragment Skill. &#xA0;However, the result of the reinforcement could bring out surprising results. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">He would be able to use Skeleton Wolf, Skeleton Bear, and Skeleton Snake as underlings. &#xA0;It would amazing.</span></p><p><span style="">However, there was no other benefit to be gained from it. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">Why was a Skeleton Warrior so strong?</span></p><p><span style="">In truth, the biggest reason why was the Armament Skill. &#xA0;Hyrkan was able to equip the Skeleton Warriors with Items that normal Users couldn&apos;t even dream about owning. </span></p><p><span style="">However, the Skeleton Wolf, Skeleton Bear, and Skeleton Snake couldn&apos;t benefit from effects of the Armament Skill. &#xA0;In conclusion, they wouldn&#x2019;t be able to use weapons.</span></p><p><span style="">It wasn&apos;t as if the Skeleton Wolf or the Skeleton Snake could swing a sword by carrying it in its mouth.</span></p><p><span style="">Instead, it would be more useful to use it on the Bone Explosives. &#xA0;If one used the Legendary Rank Ancient Power on the Bone Explosive Skill, one gained the Timer function. &#xA0;He had much more use for a timed bomb than a regular bomb.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;I planned on using it on the Skeleton Knights&#xB7;&#xB7;&#xB7;&#xB7;&#xB7;&#xB7;.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">Of course, the Skeleton Knight Skill was on top of his list. &#xA0;If one used the Legendary Rank Ancient power to reinforce the Skeleton Knight Skill, the Skeleton Knights would learn the Riding Skill. &#xA0;Moreover, they would gain Skeleton Steeds. &#xA0;They would be able to fight on a mount like the Death Knight.</span></p><p><span style="">This was why his heart was leaning towards reinforcing the Skeleton Knight Skill.</span></p><p><span style="">However, he didn&apos;t have to make the decision right now. &#xA0;It wouldn&apos;t be too late to decide after seeing what appears from this Skill Book.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Shall I open it?&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan placed his palm on top of the Skill Book.</span></p><p><span style="">[The Skill Book has revealed itself.] </span></p><p><span style="">[Would you like to learn the Bone Dragon summon skill?] </span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Huh?&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">Something ridiculous made its appearance.</span></p><p>4.</p><p><span style="">- It has been a while.</span></p><p><span style="">Hatch answered in an indifferent manner when he heard the tired voice of a man.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;It has been a while, but I&apos;m not thrilled by this meeting. &#xA0;My back still hurts from the time when you stabbed it. &#xA0;You asked for our help, yet you used us as bait.</span></p><p><span style="">- We all acted in the name of our own interests.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Do you realize how I was treated after being revealed as the traitor? &#xA0;If you knew what I went through, you wouldn&apos;t be saying those words.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">- Do you want my apology?</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I&apos;m not speaking to you, because I want to. I don&apos;t care if you apologize or not. &#xA0;If you do give me one, I&apos;m listening.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">- I&apos;m sorry.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;All right. &#xA0;Let&apos;s get down to business. &#xA0;Why did you, the First Head, want to talk specifically with me?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">At Hatch&apos;s question, the Hydra guild&apos;s first head hesitated before speaking.</span></p><p><span style="">- Hatch. &#xA0;Your former occupation... </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;It seems you want to talk about the Game System. &#xA0;However, our Queen is a bit weak on that subject. I guess I&apos;m the right person for this conversation.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">- How knowledgeable are you about the M.I. that manufactures and maintains Warlord?</span></p><p><span style="">At his question, Hatch couldn&apos;t help, but let out a mocking laugh.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I probably know more than you?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">- Before Tobot Soft produced the M.I., the base A.I......</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I also know more than you about that. &#xA0;I&apos;ll stop you there. &#xA0;I&apos;m sure you were about to talk about the Pacman Program, but Pacman isn&apos;t the M.I.&apos;s base. &#xA0;The M.I. was originally a management A.I. used in various field. &#xA0;The M.I. produced by the Tobo Soft used hybrid techniques from various field to test the performance of the M.I. &#xA0;The game we are enjoying right now arose from the Package Game Production software, and the Pacman Program was grafted onto the M.I. to make the final result. &#xA0;I guess I could describe it as a game production and management speciality M.I. &#xA0;If you want to continue listening to this explanation press 1. &#xA0;If you don&apos;t want to hear it, press 2. &#xA0;If you want to listen to it again, press #.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">- As expected, you are well versed on this subject.</span></p><p><span style="">Hatch hesitated when he heard Citrus&apos; words. After hesitating, he spoke.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;So what do you want to speak to me about?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">- Warlord is a very well made game. &#xA0;It also has a Main Scenario Quest that evolves based on the User&apos;s actions and the progress of the game. &#xA0;It was the first time such a system was attempted, and the product was surprisingly close to perfection. &#xA0;Do you know why this was possible?</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;The developers refused to intervene and add in variables. &#xA0;Basically, it was the result of not ordering the A.I. around. &#xA0;This is also the reason why a proper event never appears in this game.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">At that moment, Hatch was going through his past memories. &#xA0;It wasn&apos;t a great memory. &#xA0;He went to work in the morning and he came back at night. &#xA0;He used to spend more time at his company than his home, and he hadn&apos;t been perverted enough to have enjoyed such a life.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;The M.I. would go crazy if it had to do events unrelated to the game story. &#xA0;It also won&#x2019;t add Event-only monsters or a party hat that celebrate the 3 year anniversary of the Warlord. &#xA0;It was the right move to stop any outside variables from being introduced into the game. &#xA0;However, the M.I. governing Warlord &#xA0;is only an early product. &#xA0;This was why they have the leeway for outside intervention and accidents. &#xA0;Did you call me to listen to this explanation? &#xA0;Really?</span></p><p><span style="">- According to our Quest information, the third Main Scenario Quest or the Quest after this one will be the last to the Main Scenario Quest.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Uh whew. Thank you for letting me know such amazing news.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Hatch wasn&apos;t surprised by Citrus&apos; earnest words. He acted as if his information was a given.</span></p><p><span style="">- When the Main Scenario Quest come to an end, this game will start its service like any other &#xA0;ordinary game.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Aigo. &#xA0;You surprised me again.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">- It will no longer be a game where the game progress would be determined by the Users and the progress of the game. &#xA0;The production team would have to add new episodes and new stages. &#xA0;At that point, it&apos;ll merely be a game trying to extend its length of life.</span></p><p><span style="">However, Hatch didn&apos;t act disingenuous any more. &#xA0;There was no fun in making the same joke over and over again. </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;You probably know this better than anyone else. &#xA0;So what do you really want to talk to me about?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">- I want us to slow down the progress of the Main Scenario Quest. &#xA0;Even if the popularity of Warlord would be maintained after the Main Scenario Quest ends, it wouldn&apos;t be like before. &#xA0;The biggest harm will come to the 30 great guilds, who has to operate a live channel. &#xA0;In truth, the speculative funds that were injected into the 30 great guilds have created a bubble.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;This isn&apos;t true for our guild. &#xA0;We have a sturdy backer.</span></p><p><span style="">- It is as I have said. &#xA0;Let us make an agreement not to progress in the Main Scenario Quest at a breakneck speed. &#xA0;At the very least, you understand the reason behind why we should do this. &#xA0;It is also why I&apos;m speaking to you. &#xA0;If I made this offer to the Storm Queen, it wouldn&#x2019;t take hold.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;That is true.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">For the first time in this meeting, Hatch decided to accept Citrus&apos; words.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;So what do you want us to do?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">- I want you guys to ignore the Hahoe Mask. </span></p><p><span style="">Hahoe Mask.</span></p><p><span style="">When he heard that word, Hatch put on a serious expression for the first place. &#xA0;The smile on his lips was erased, and the his facial muscles stiffened. </span></p><p><span style="">- If you want to drag down the Hahoe Mask by his ankles, I welcome it. &#xA0;However, don&apos;t even think about using him as a piece on the chess board. &#xA0;We shouldn&#x2019;t fight and compete with each other for the prize with the Hahoe Mask nearby. &#xA0;That is all I want to say.</span></p><p><span style="">The call came to an end.</span></p><p><span style="">After the call ended, Hatch let out a long sigh.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;The Hahoe Mask... &#xA0;This is driving me nuts. &#xA0;She is completely obsessed with him... It seem the Main Scenario Quest will come to an end soon. &#xA0;I should sell my Tobot Soft stocks.&#x2019;</span></p>
