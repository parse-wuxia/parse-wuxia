<p>Chapter 155 &#x2013; Find the Ruins (2)</p><p>5.</p><p><span style="">[You&apos;ve found a ruin.] </span></p><p><span style="">[You&apos;ve acquired the Title &apos;Ruin Excavator&apos;.] </span></p><p><span style="">[Please find the out-of-place Artifact within the Ruins.] </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Uh-whew.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">This was the System Announcement he had been impatiently waiting for. &#xA0;Instead of a joyous shout, Hyrkan&apos;s shoulders sagged as he let out a heavy sigh.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;This bastard really&#x2026;.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan&apos;s gaze naturally turned towards the cause of his sigh. &#xA0;It immediately headed towards the corpse of the Golden Goblin., but his gaze didn&apos;t stop there. &#xA0;It continued to move to land on the Skeleton Warrior, which was standing over the corpse in an imposing manner.</span></p><p><span style="">The Skeleton Warrior didn&apos;t avoid its owner&apos;s gaze. &#xA0;It&apos;s imposing figure was reminiscent of a hunting dog standing over its prey. &#xA0;It was as if it was waiting for a compliment from its master. &#xA0;This was why Hyrkan swallowed his anger.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Yes. &#xA0;I&apos;m the one that taught them, so it is my fault. &#xA0;They are blameless in this. &#xA0;I&apos;m the one to blame for teaching them too well.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan abruptly felt such a feeling. &#xA0;He really felt the truth that he had grown terrifying monsters.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;If monsters like my Skeletons came out as opponents..... Uh-whew. &#xA0;Just the thought of it gives me nightmare.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">He once again thanked the stars that his Skeletons weren&apos;t an enemy he would have to face.</span></p><p><span style="">Of course, such sentiments didn&apos;t last long. &#xA0;This wasn&apos;t some significant milestone where he should get lost in sentimental feelings. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan once again shook his head from side to side, and he shook off the unimportant feelings. &#xA0;Then he immediately looked forward. &#xA0;The eyes within the Hahoe Mask glazed over.</span></p><p><span style="">Some kind of a building was reflected in Hyrkan&apos;s eyes. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">He use the expression &apos;some kind&apos;, because it was hard to judge the shape of the building.</span></p><p><span style="">First, the building was half-buried in the ground. The part that stuck out from the ground was reminiscent of an earthworm. &#xA0;It was hard to discern the shape of the building, since it was covered in tree roots. &#xA0;If one glanced at it, one might not even notice it was a building. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">On the other hand, one could feel a mystical energy coming off of it even if it was faint.</span></p><p><span style="">The most eye-catching part of the building was the bricks that were giving off this mystical energy. &#xA0;Each brick was carved with various symbols. Instead of an engraving, it was embossed. &#xA0;The shapes stood out in relief, so the shapes were quite noticeable.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Is it a temple?&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">His admiration ended there. &#xA0;The Skeleton Warrior, which had defeated the Golden Goblin, was returned to its Skeleton Fragment form. &#xA0;Then he entered the building. &#xA0;There was only one tunnel that lead inside. &#xA0;It was so small that he had mistaken it for a window, but he was able to squeeze his body into the space.</span></p><p><span style="">His shoulders were hunched and his head was lowered. &#xA0;He walked slowly like a turtle with his back hunched. &#xA0;Hyrkan was able to stretch out his back after ten steps. &#xA0;A deep darkness greeted Hyrkan when he straightened his back.</span></p><p><span style="">A bright light formed on top of Hyrkan&apos;s head.</span></p><p><span style="">Underneath the bright light, he re-equipped the glove he had taken off to activate the light app on his wristwatch. &#xA0;Hyrkan quickly looked at his surrounding as he put on his glove.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;It is a temple.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">The outer appearance of the building was too damaged to confirm his suspicion, but the basic components were present. </span></p><p><span style="">He had seen the bricks before he entered the building, and each of them were embossed with letters. Moreover, there were pictures instead of wall papers within the building. &#xA0;Everything was carefully crafted to imbue symbolic significance, and this was why Hyrkan thought this place was a temple.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;I hope something decent comes out.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">He was hopeful, but Hyrkan didn&apos;t think there were any treasures here in the temple that would make his eyes turn round.</span></p><p><span style="">The only thing he&apos;ll be able to find here would be clues.</span></p><p><span style="">Toohk toohk! </span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan scattered two Skeleton Fragments on the floor as he got ready to search for the clues.</span></p><p><span style="">The Skeleton Warriors quickly gained their forms, and their outer appearance was strikingly different from the standard Skeleton Warriors. &#xA0;It was less than 1 meter tall and they weren&apos;t wearing armors made out of steel. &#xA0;They were wearing leather armor that made them look agile. &#xA0;Moreover, the weapons they held in their hand were suited for their size. &#xA0;The swords were small enough to be called daggers. &#xA0;If a normal User held this weapon, it would look like a knife.</span></p><p><span style="">However, unlike their outer appearance, these Skeletons were terrifying.</span></p><p><span style="">These particular Skeleton Warriors were made from a level 180 monsters called Mini Ogre. &#xA0;Hyrkan had never summoned these Skeletons in public. &#xA0;He also didn&apos;t put them in his videos.</span></p><p><span style="">Weapon! &#xA0;This was a secret weapon that he had hidden away! </span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan stationed the Skeletons near the entrance, and he started his search.</span></p><p>6.</p><p><span style="">&#x201C;In the end, this is a game.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Hatch spoke as he looked at the remnants.... &#xA0;He looked at the walls that was being propped up by pillars and something that couldn&apos;t be seen.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Since it is a game, there is always a solution. &#xA0;If there isn&apos;t a solution, it is a bug instead of a game.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">The Stormhunters guild had found a ruin.</span></p><p><span style="">The Stormhunters guild had took the most important first step in the Ruined Kingdom episode.</span></p><p><span style="">Of course, this was a momentous first step for the Stormhunters guild, but they didn&apos;t stop to appreciate the moment.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;We&apos;ve found the entrance! &#xA0;It is an entrance to the underground!&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">When the entrance to the underground was found, they once again moved at a desperate pace.</span></p><p><span style="">Hatch immediately started giving orders. &#xA0;Hatch looked at Hahui, and he pointed his finger towards the newly discovered entrance.</span></p><p><span style="">They had already formed an expedition group for such a situation. &#xA0;Hahui was chosen to be the leader of the expedition group.</span></p><p><span style="">Hatch&apos;s gesture meant for Hahui to get ready. &#xA0;Hahui soon finished her preparations. &#xA0;When she moved near the newly discovered entrance, the members of the exploration team started to gather around her.</span></p><p><span style="">There were a total of 12 Users. &#xA0;Hatch spoke to Hahui in front of the team.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hahui.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yeah.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">There was a weird atmosphere that emanated from their short conversation. &#xA0;The other members of the expedition team tilted their heads in confusion. </span></p><p><span style="">&apos;What the hell?&apos;</span></p><p><span style="">&apos;Could it be?&apos;</span></p><p><span style="">There were puzzled expressions on their faces.</span></p><p><span style="">However, these expressions didn&apos;t last long.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;You stubbornly insisted on being the leader of the exploration team. &#xA0;I want you to do your work properly now that I made you the team leader.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;If there is a problem, I want you to turn back. &#xA0;I don&apos;t want you to suddenly attack the enemy, because it annoys you.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Are you trying to lecture me right now?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Is isn&apos;t a lecture. &#xA0;I&apos;m giving you an advice.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">The weird atmosphere disappeared in an instant. &#xA0;Hahui and Hatch spoke like their normal selves.</span></p><p><span style="">Everyone realized that they misread the strange atmosphere.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;You want to die?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">It was a phrase everyone heard the most from Hahui. &#xA0;Hatch suddenly stopped speaking at this point.</span></p><p><span style="">Usually, Hatch gave up on the conversation at this point, and he would gloss over the conversation.</span></p><p><span style="">However, it was different right now. &#xA0;If these were normal circumstances, he wouldn&apos;t have even given her the advice. &#xA0;The problem was the worst case scenario of suffering the Game Over. &#xA0;The normal Game Over penalty was steep, but it could be overcome. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">However, it was different right now. &#xA0;If Hahui suffered a Game Over, it would take her 4 days to get back here assuming everything went smoothly. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">Currently, the mess at the Voodook&apos;s tunnel meant it might take her 10 days to get back here instead of 4 days.</span></p><p><span style="">This was why Hatch gave another warning.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Don&apos;t die. &#xA0;Just don&apos;t die. I don&apos;t care what you do, but don&apos;t die. &#xA0;Please don&apos;t die. &#xA0;All right?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Instead of answering Hatch&apos;s words, Hahui smirked as she turned her back to him.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;The exploration team is going in!&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">When Hahui&apos;s exploration teamed moved, Hatch didn&apos;t even have time for a break. &#xA0;He had to pick up another thread of conversation.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hatch.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes. &#xA0;Please speak.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Shir immediately spoke to him.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What do you think about the newly formed alliance?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">She immediately asked her question.</span></p><p><span style="">It was a sudden and out of the blue question. &#xA0;If one had just heard the question, it would be hard to discern the purpose behind the question.</span></p><p><span style="">However, Hatch immediately figured out the intent and purpose behind the question. &#xA0;He gave his opinion as if he had been waiting for this question. </span></p><p><span style="">&quot;There is the V&amp;V, Big Smiles and Wul-gahng. &#xA0;It is inevitable that they&#x2019;ll team up together. &#xA0;I&apos;m not sure about this, but there is a high probability that these three guilds formed an alliance with the Sweepers guild and the Blossoms guild. &#xA0;Of course, this is my personal hunch, and it is only an educated guess.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Are these five guilds the only ones that joined forces?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Hatch scratched his head.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;On the surface, there doesn&apos;t seem to be any other movement. &#xA0;In the past great battle event, there were the guilds that sat out the event with the V&amp;V guild. &#xA0;We&apos;ll have to assume those guilds are sympathetic to the V&amp;V guilds, and they&apos;ll move in their favor if needed.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What do you think they are trying to do right now?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Their plan is obvious. &#xA0;They basically want to trample over everyone with superior numbers.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Numerous conflicts and unrest occurred as the new stage called the Black Continent &#xA0;emerged.</span></p><p><span style="">The biggest and most recent mess was happening around Voodook&apos;s tunnel.</span></p><p><span style="">Several guilds of the 30 great guilds were sending a massive amount of members towards the Black Continent. &#xA0;Of course, there were so many people in queue that the wooden post was inadequate to post the list of the line.</span></p><p><span style="">There was a restriction on how many Users could go in at a fixed interval, and congestion inevitably occurred when high number of people gathered at this location. &#xA0;As the congestion grew, the discontent also grew.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I believe the ruckus created in front of the Voodook&apos;s tunnel was planned.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">The mess was deliberately created to change the mind of the Users that planned on crossing the Urugal mountain range.</span></p><p><span style="">If they planned that far ahead, Hatch was able to sufficiently discern their motive.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I&apos;m sure of it. &#xA0;The five guilds have allied with each other, and they plan on monopolizing the Black Continent. &#xA0;This is obvious, but they&apos;ll start eliminating competitors once enough members cross over to the Black Continent.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Solo Stage.</span></p><p><span style="">If they took advantage of the Voodook tunnel&apos;s special characteristic, it wasn&apos;t an impossible task.</span></p><p><span style="">Shir asked another question after she heard Hatch&apos;s explanation.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Did these 5 guilds offer an alliance with us? &#xA0;Did they contact any of us?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;No offers were given.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Basically, we are one of their enemies.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes. We might have to play it safe. &#xA0;It might get too scary to play this game.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Play it safe....</span></p><p><span style="">Shir let out a sneer instead of a bitter smile. &#xA0;Hatch had the same expression on his face.</span></p><p><span style="">They weren&apos;t really going to play it safe. &#xA0;The sneer on their faces indicated the opposite.</span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan&apos;s ruin exploration didn&apos;t take too long. &#xA0;In the first place, he couldn&apos;t really call it an exploration. &#xA0;The ruin he had found wasn&apos;t that large. &#xA0;Excluding the space he had entered in the beginning, he had searched exactly two more locations before his exploration came to an end.</span></p><p><span style="">After concluding his exploration, Hyrkan discovered the out-of-place artifact.</span></p><p><span style="">The out-of-place artifact he had found was a conch carved out of wood. &#xA0;It was pretty simple figuring out how to use the Item. &#xA0;Hyrkan put his ears against the opening of the Wooden Conch.</span></p><p><span style="">- We are requesting for help.</span></p><p><span style="">The Wooden Conch immediately let out a sound.</span></p><p><span style="">- Heard Fortress. &#xA0;The Dragon&apos;s army is coming towards the Heard Fortress.</span></p><p><span style="">The voice was filled with desperation.</span></p><p><span style="">- I&apos;ll say it again. &#xA0;The Heard Fortress is requesting for help. &#xA0;The Dragon&apos;s army is coming this way.</span></p><p><span style="">The voice within the Wooden Conch ended there. &#xA0;The sound was too disjointed, and it was hard to decipher the content unless one heard it again. &#xA0;However, Hyrkan didn&apos;t need to hear it again.</span></p><p><span style="">[Quest &apos;Remnant of the Heard Fortress&apos; has started.] </span></p><p><span style="">There was a notification system that would be more informative than listening to the conch again.</span></p><p><span style="">When Hyrkan heard the System Announcement for the Quest, he immediately opened the Quest Window.</span></p><p><span style="">[Remnant of the Heard Fortress] </span></p><p><span style="">- Quest Rank : Rare </span></p><p><span style="">- Quest Level Range : 190</span></p><p><span style="">- Quest Content : Find the remnant of the Fortress mentioned by the out-of-place artifact.</span></p><p><span style="">- Quest Reward : None</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;The Quest Rank is Rare&#xB7;&#xB7;&#xB7;&#xB7;&#xB7;&#xB7;.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">The Quest Content was light, but at the same time, it was familiar to Hyrkan.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;I&apos;m guessing the reward for this Quest will merely be a Transcendent Rank Ancient Power.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">This was why Hyrkan wasn&apos;t too worried about the content of the Quest. &#xA0;It was within his expectation.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Heard Fortress&#xB7;&#xB7;&#xB7;&#xB7;&#xB7;&#xB7;.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">The problem was the word Heard Fortress.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;They changed the terminology.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">This was the first time Hyrkan had heard of the word.</span></p><p><span style="">The terminology that appeared in Warlord was controlled by the AI system, and it was able to make small changes as needed. &#xA0;Still, this knowledge wasn&apos;t able to erase the bitter taste from Hyrkan&apos;s mouth.</span></p><p><span style="">However, Hyrkan didn&apos;t frown at the bitter taste. &#xA0;Instead, a small smile formed on his mouth.</span></p><p>7.</p><p><span style="">The Big Smiles guild had started it. &#xA0;The 5 guilds within the 30 great guilds tirelessly crossed the Urugal mountain range. </span></p><p><span style="">Of course, the process was very perilous. &#xA0;If twelve Users attempted it, around half would be forced back to the starting point.</span></p><p><span style="">The Skull Collector was trivial to the User wearing the Hahoe Mask, but it was a enemy that couldn&apos;t be beaten without skill and luck for the others Users.</span></p><p><span style="">The Users that were able to make the arduous climb over the Urugal mountain range were basically treasures to the guilds.</span></p><p><span style="">Of course, the Big Smiles guild wanted to protect their treasures, so they started their activities with the safety of guild members in mind.</span></p><p><span style="">The hunting of monsters were done in large groups. &#xA0;It was excessive even when one considered the monsters&apos; level and quality. &#xA0;Moreover, one had get permission to use any of the consumables. &#xA0;These were Items that they had drank like water in the past.</span></p><p><span style="">They basically gave up doing tasks Users normally had to do in the game. &#xA0;They gave up on exploration and leveling up.</span></p><p><span style="">In such a situation, the Big Smiles guild was able to find a ruin. &#xA0;Luck was on their side.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Heard fortress. &#xA0;Doesn&apos;t this seem like a really important Quest?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">The Big Smiles guild was able to learn an important clue about the Heard Fortress.</span></p><p><span style="">They were currently promoting safety over all else at that moment. &#xA0;It was inevitable, but a discussion arose regarding what they should do with this important clue.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Isn&apos;t it obvious? &#xA0;We have to do that Quest.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Isn&apos;t it too dangerous? &#xA0;What if we all die? &#xA0;Do you realize how long the queue line is right now?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Even if it is dangerous, he have to take a risk of this size. &#xA0;We can&apos;t always stay put as we suck on our thumbs.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;The most important thing is safety. &#xA0;Our main directive is to survive.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Since we are insisting on safety above all else, the discontent amongst the guild members have reached the boiling point. &#xA0;They aren&apos;t able to level up, and they can&apos;t earn money through hunts. &#xA0;Basically, they are wasting time by connecting into the game right now. &#xA0;We have to appease them. &#xA0;We have to carry out this Quest.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I guess we have no choice. &#xA0;So who&apos;ll carry it out? &#xA0;If we want to minimize the risk, should we sent our best team?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Should we send out our best team with the Killer at the core?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Wouldn&apos;t that be more dangerous? &#xA0;I&apos;m sure it&apos;ll never happen, but if Sinclair somehow suffers a Game Over.... &#xA0;We don&apos;t have any information regarding this place, and it is teeming with monsters over level 200.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Let&apos;s form an exploration group. &#xA0;Let&apos;s send an exploration group first.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">They had basically found a treasure map that lead to a very valuable treasure.</span></p><p><span style="">However, they had no idea what risks they would be taking on when they approached this valuable treasure. &#xA0;Currently, someone had to attach a gas tank on their body. &#xA0;Someone had to throw their body into the unknown to see if it was a fire pit or a water pit.</span></p><p><span style="">The User, who had to hold the gas tank, needed to have symbolic rank, but he had to be someone they wouldn&apos;t miss at all. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">This was why they chose him.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;You are the commander in charge of the Heard Fortress Quest, Apollo. &#xA0;Do a good job.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">This was why Apollo became the commander in charge of exploring the Heard Fortress.</span></p>
