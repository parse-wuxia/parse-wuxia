<p>Chapter 156 &#x2013; Heard Fortress (1)</p><p>1.</p><p><span style="">Treasure Hunt.</span></p><p><span style="">If Hyrkan wanted to give the shortest summary of the Ruined Kingdom episode, Hyrkan wouldn&apos;t hesitate to call it a treasure hunt.</span></p><p><span style="">All the tasks the Users had to do in the Ruined Kingdom episode fell into the purview of finding treasures.</span></p><p><span style="">There were treasures hidden. &#xA0;The Users had to find the clues to find these treasure. &#xA0;When one found the clues, one had to go to where the treasures were located at. &#xA0;Moreover, as one heads towards the location, monsters crowded the roads to interfere with the treasure hunt.</span></p><p><span style="">In this episode, Warlord used a method that a lot of games used. &#xA0;Warlord had added a setting that made this episode more like a traditional game.</span></p><p><span style="">The Ruined Kingdom was located in the Black Continent, and the User would gain a Quest in this land. &#xA0;When the User starts heading towards the destination, the game was set to increase the number of monsters on the road! &#xA0;It increased the overall number, and it also increased the regen speed. &#xA0;This in turn increased the number of monsters regenerating.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;They didn&apos;t change this setting at all.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan was able to confirm his suspicion when he saw the 3 Voodoo Lizardmen block his path. &#xA0;They had summoned thirty Zombie monsters.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;It is exactly 1.5 times more.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">After he entered the Black Continent, he had faced numerous Voodoo Lizardmen in succession. &#xA0;During that period of time, most of the Voodoo Lizardmen operated on their own. &#xA0;At most, they worked as a duo. &#xA0;Moreover, each Voodoo Lizardmen were able to summon up to 7 Zombies.</span></p><p><span style="">However, three Voodoo Lizardmen had appeared right now, and each of them had summoned 10 Zombies each.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;This game is so shitty sometimes.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">The content of the Ruined Kingdom was entirely different from the past, but the setting of the game was identical to the past. &#xA0;He let out a bitter laugh, and the sound of him grinding his teeth could be heard between his laugh.</span></p><p><span style="">However, he was able put aside his feelings for the battle. &#xA0;Hyrkan was able to unhesitatingly immerse himself in battle. &#xA0;He did it in a very natural, proficient, and calm manner.</span></p><p><span style="">Ddahk ddahk! </span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan had already summoned two Skeleton Knights, and he gave the order for battle. The Skeleton Knights were facing overwhelming number of foes, but they didn&apos;t hesitate. &#xA0;They threw their bodies towards the 30 Zombies.</span></p><p><span style="">Shweeeek! </span></p><p><span style="">The Skeleton Knights swung their swords. &#xA0;&#xA0;A sharp sound emanated as each sword stroke severed various parts of the Zombies.</span></p><p><span style="">Chul-puh-duhk! </span></p><p><span style="">The severed parts sloughed off like mud. &#xA0;Moreover, the stumps were quickly regenerating the missing part.</span></p><p><span style="">Ooh-uh-uh! </span></p><p><span style="">The Zombies shuffled forward as they let out a cry. &#xA0;It was hard to discern if they were crying or screaming.</span></p><p><span style="">The Voodoo Lizardmen kept shaking their staffs as they danced. &#xA0;It was as if they were cheering on the Zombies.</span></p><p><span style="">Ggi-ee! Ggi-ee!</span></p><p><span style="">Sometimes they even let out a weird cry as they looked at the sky.</span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan threw Skeleton Fragments towards them.</span></p><p><span style="">Too-toohk! </span></p><p><span style="">The Skeleton Fragment fell near the feet of the Voodoo Lizardmen, and it quickly gained its form. &#xA0;He hadn&apos;t planned this out, but the Skeleton Warrior ironically had the shape of a Lizardman. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">It was made from a level 180 Fanged Lizardman&apos;s bones as ingredients. &#xA0;These monsters were famous for their sharp canines.</span></p><p><span style="">The Fanged Lizardman had a unique battle style where it bit its enemy with its sharp canines.</span></p><p><span style="">When it took form, it immediately bit the Voodoo Lizardman in front of it.</span></p><p><span style="">Kieehhhk! </span></p><p><span style="">When the Voodoo Lizardman let out a scream in fright, the Zombies turned towards their owner.</span></p><p><span style="">Naturally, the Skeleton Knights were shown the backs of the Zombies.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Would you look at this?&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">The Zombies had ignored the Skeleton Knights, and the Skeleton Knights started chopping off their heads as penalty for their action. </span></p><p><span style="">Puh-uhk! </span></p><p><span style="">The Skeleton Knights and Hyrkan were like walking guillotines. &#xA0;They unhesitatingly unleashed violence.</span></p><p><span style="">The most striking part was that Hyrkan&apos;s sword strike didn&apos;t make any sounds.</span></p><p><span style="">Poo-hwaht! </span></p><p><span style="">The Skeleton Knights let out a sound that could be easily discerned as a sound a sword makes.</span></p><p><span style="">Soo-oohk! </span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan&apos;s sword sounded like a shaving blade cutting facial hair.</span></p><p><span style="">There was no cry. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">This meant the sword wasn&apos;t the Crying Sword.</span></p><p><span style="">So what was identity of the sword in his hands?</span></p><p><span style="">It was the Deposed Prince&apos;s Sword! </span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan was using the sword that he had previously equipped on the Death Knight.</span></p><p><span style="">It&apos;s effectiveness was a given.</span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan moved forward as he severed the necks of the Zombies. &#xA0;When the Zombie&apos;s head fell to the ground, he crushed it as if he was stepping on rotten tomatoes.</span></p><p><span style="">Of course, the Zombies didn&apos;t just die from such an attack.</span></p><p><span style="">They were called Zombies, because they were Undead.</span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan was just buying time.</span></p><p><span style="">He was buying time, so his Skeleton Warriors could take down the Voodoo Lizardmen without being harassed by the Zombies.</span></p><p><span style="">Ggieh! &#xA0;Ggieehhh! </span></p><p><span style="">While the owner of the Skeletons and the Skeleton Knights displayed their prowess, the Skeleton Warriors loyally performed their duty.. &#xA0;The sudden cry and scream from the Voodoo Lizardmen was like a live update on how the Skeleton Warriors were faring against them.</span></p><p><span style="">The Skeleton Warriors finished their battle around the 3 minute mark. &#xA0;They answered their owner&apos;s trust with a huge gift.</span></p><p><span style="">[You level has increased.] </span></p><p><span style="">Level Up! </span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan was now level 207. &#xA0;However, at that moment, he wasn&apos;t feeling happy about his Level Up. &#xA0;Regret was the first emotion he felt. &#xA0;He should have used up all his magical energy by summoning a Skeleton Warrior or the Golem before he leveled up.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;I&apos;m overflowing with money, but I&apos;m not able to spend it anywhere right now. &#xA0;Jeez.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">Currently, his account was overflowing with money, but he still had a lot of consumable in his possession. &#xA0;If he went out and bought more, it would be a waste of money. &#xA0;&#xA0;He was a little bit irritated that he still lived on a fiscally conservative budget. &#xA0;He couldn&#x2019;t bring himself to waste his Items on luxury items.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;In the past, I saw Rich Lich&#x2019;s interview. &#xA0;He said even if he had a lot of money, there wasn&#x2019;t much he wanted to spend it on. &#xA0;I wanted to punch him in the face when he said it. &#xA0;However, now I am in his position.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan was definitely feeling the pressure being felt by the numerous Users, who had stepped onto the Black Continent.</span></p><p><span style="">Currently, the biggest problem tormenting the User on the Black Continent was the consumable Items. &#xA0;It was too hard to obtain them.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;The 30 great guilds are always the problem. &#xA0;This is especially true for Big Smiles and V&amp;V&#x2026; &#xA0;If I catch them, I&apos;ll....&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">In the past, there had been several Users, who had taken advantage of the high market price. &#xA0;They acted as mules as they moved consumable Items through the Voodook&apos;s tunnel. &#xA0;This was why Users had been able to trade Items near the summit of the Urugal mountain. &#xA0;It had been expensive, but at the very least, they had the option to purchase these Items.</span></p><p><span style="">However, five guilds were trying to push through the Voodook&apos;s Tunnel right now, and they were causing an enormous amount of traffic. &#xA0;The possibility of trading with these enterprising Users were gone now.</span></p><p><span style="">He had been fully ready when he came here, but he never expected such a development. &#xA0;This was why hate was burning inside him towards the source of the traffic.</span></p><p><span style="">His loss didn&#x2019;t just end there.</span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan let out a sigh as he dismantled the corpses of the Voodoo Lizardmen, which had been defeated by the Skeleton Warriors.</span></p><p><span style="">He dismantled the scaled corpse, and he found a Gem Ingredient from one of the melting body. &#xA0;He carefully put the Item into the pouch where he stored the recovery Items.</span></p><p><span style="">The Gem Ingredient that came out of the Voodoo Lizardman could be used to produce an Item. &#xA0;Basically, there were two types of Gem. &#xA0;One could be used to repair Items, and the other could &#xA0;be used to make recovery Items. &#xA0;If one chewed on an Ingredient that was used to make a recovery Item, one could still receive some recovery effect.</span></p><p><span style="">Of course, no User would use it in such a manner. &#xA0;It was like finding truffles in the mountain. &#xA0;It was akin to eating these truffles, because one was hungry.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;I can&#x2019;t belive I have to eat this.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">The Voodoo Lizardman&#x2019;s Gem Ingredients were used to make level 200 Rare Rank defesnive Items. &#xA0;Currently, a level 200 Rare Item with decent Option were trade for around 1000 gold.</span></p><p><span style="">He had to feed on such Item Ingredients to recover his magical energy.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;&#xB7;&#xB7;&#xB7;&#xB7;&#xB7;I have to quickly find the Heard Fortress. &#xA0;I have to progress in the Quest to make that region into a foothold.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">This hurt him as much as losing to a monster.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;If not, I might die from an upset stomach. &#xA0;Eventhough I have a lot of money, I can&#x2019;t keep doing this with a sound mind.</span></p><p><span style="">Of course, this hardship wasn&#x2019;t indefinite.</span></p><p><span style="">He wasn&#x2019;t sure about it, but in his memories, he remembered the Fortress turned in a foothold when one finished the Quest. &#xA0;When the Heard Fortress becomes a foothold, the NPC would return. &#xA0;There would be cubicles where he&#x2019;ll be able to make Items.</span></p><p><span style="">It was similar to what had happened at the Cursed Castle.</span></p><p><span style="">This would also be the most important part of the Ruined Kingdom episode.</span></p><p><span style="">The first one to forge the road would have a hard time, but the benefit given to the person, who paved the first road was significant. &#xA0;It would be equal to the amount of hardship one faced.</span></p><p><span style="">In other words, he had to avoid being in 2nd place. &#xA0;The 2nd place User wouldn&#x2019;t get anything. &#xA0;The only thing waiting for the 2nd place User was a heartburn.</span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan raised his head, and he put the Wooden Conch, which he had found in the Ruin, to his ear.</span></p><p><span style=""> - To the east. &#xA0;To the east.... </span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan turned his head towards the east when he heard the announcement from the Wooden Conch.</span></p><p><span style="">Koo-uh-uh-uh! </span></p><p><span style="">From beyond his eyesight, an unknown monster roared as it called out towards Hyrkan.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;If I get a windfall of Items, I&#x2019;ll spend my money in a crazy way.&#x2019;</span></p><p>2.</p><p><span style="">They didn&apos;t run into each other by luck. &#xA0;It was fate.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;It&apos;s the Hahoe Mask!&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">When the Big Smiles guild received the Heard Fortress Quest, they decided to proceed with the Quest in a safe manner. &#xA0;They created an exploration party, and Apollo was made the leader of this party.</span></p><p><span style="">Of course, Apollo wanted to look out for his own safety. &#xA0;So he picked out an advance group from within the exploration group, and he sent them ahead.</span></p><p><span style="">He picked 7 Users for the advance group. &#xA0;There were 4 Strikers, 2 Priest and a Magician in the party. &#xA0;They started investigating the direction pointed out by the Wooden Conch they found at a Ruin.</span></p><p><span style="">When they heard the sound of battle between a User and a monster, they naturally headed towards the sound. &#xA0;Both the monsters and Users had to be investigated.</span></p><p><span style="">Currently, there weren&#x2019;t that many groups heading towards the Heard Fortress. &#xA0;The fact that they met Hyrkan was intended by god.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Run!&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">When the advance group discovered the Hahoe Mask, they immediately ran away. &#xA0;Hyrkan saw the group of people run away as soon as they saw him. &#xA0;When he felt their eyes on him, Hyrkan immediately gave up on the monster he had been fighting. &#xA0;He immediately became a pursuer.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Where are they from?&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan didn&apos;t immediately know the identity of these Users.</span></p><p><span style="">However, they had run away as soon as they saw Hyrkan. &#xA0;He was sure they didn&apos;t hold any good intentions towards him.</span></p><p><span style="">Moreover, if they were able to get here, they weren&apos;t mediocre Users. &#xA0;If he let them go, they might aim their swords at him next time they met. &#xA0;They were potential enemies.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;The only way I&apos;ll live is to kill all these bastards.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">At that moment, Hyrkan came to a conclusion that he had to move in a desperate manner.</span></p><p><span style="">Currently, the 5 guilds including the V&amp;V guild and Big Smiles guild were making an enormous mess at the Voodook&apos;s Tunnel. &#xA0;He was well aware of the fact that they were sending a massive amount of Users to the other side of the Urugal mountain range. &#xA0;This was a main topic of discussion on websites that catered to contents from Warlord.</span></p><p><span style="">He could guess what these 5 guilds were aiming for. &#xA0;They weren&#x2019;t sacrificing guild members, so the Users that came later would have an easier time.</span></p><p><span style="">They planned on showing the tyranny that could be conducted by the large guilds. &#xA0;It was a level of tyranny that was unimaginable to a normal User!</span></p><p><span style="">However, Hyrkan had faced the tyranny from the large guilds before. &#xA0;He received the punishment from facing up to such tyranny. &#xA0;He knew well the despair and dirty feeling that came with it.</span></p><p><span style="">His preparations were all done for this day.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;I&apos;m glad I invested a lot of money in this.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">This was something he had prepared for Users, who would run away from Hyrkan. &#xA0;It was his secret weapon. &#xA0;It was meant to be used to whittle away his enemies. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan took out Skeleton Fragments from the Skeleton Fragment Pouch hanging off of his waist.</span></p><p><span style="">The four Skeleton Warriors that showed up were small in stature. &#xA0;It was the Mini Ogre Skeleton Warriors.</span></p><p><span style="">These weren&#x2019;t the normal ones. &#xA0;These 4 were wearing level 170 Unique Rank defensive set. &#xA0;They wore the Forest Pursuer set.</span></p><p><span style="">The set Item could only be made by catching the Chameleon Jackal, and this monster was only accessible through Quests related to the Elven tribes. &#xA0;Currently, there were only a few amount of these sets in circulation. &#xA0;The Movement Speed option was greater than any other Unique rank set Items.</span></p><p><span style="">At one point, a single set was traded for 30 thousand gold. &#xA0;In recent days, if one wanted to obtain the set in a swift manner, one had to give up 10 thousand gold for it.</span></p><p><span style="">On top of it all, Mini Ogres were geniuses at pursuing foes. &#xA0;Their small bodies contained an explosive power, and even a seasoned Striker couldn&apos;t shake off their pursuit. No Users attempted a pursuit battle against the Mini Ogres.</span></p><p><span style="">The finishing touch was the Madness Helm.</span></p><p><span style="">These expensive pursuers were created solely for chasing down targets. &#xA0;The horned Mini Ogre Skeleton Warriors were able to close the significant gap between its preys in an instant.</span></p><p><span style="">In the end, it was inevitable that the slow footed Priest became the sacrificial lamb. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">The attack of Mini Ogre Skeleton Warrior wasn&apos;t aimed at the chest. &#xA0;It was inevitably aimed towards the knees and thighs. &#xA0;The Priest fell to the ground from a single blow.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ooh-ah-ah!&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">The Priest&apos;s world spun round and round. &#xA0;He reflexively let out a scream. &#xA0;The scream ended only after the priest fell face down on the ground. &#xA0;The priest raised his head from the ground.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Aigo. My head....&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">It seemed the Mini Ogre Skeleton Warriors had already moved past him. &#xA0;He couldn&#x2019;t see any of them in his surrounding.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Huh? &#xA0;I don&apos;t see those shorties. &#xA0;Did they go somewhere else?&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">The Priest looked around his surrounding, and he tried to get off from the ground.</span></p><p><span style="">Poo-oohk! </span></p><p><span style="">However, when he was trying to get up, a sword pierced through his back to come out of the his chest. &#xA0;He didn&apos;t even need to turn around at look. &#xA0;He let out a shout of frustration when he saw the tip of the sword.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Shit!&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">The Priest&apos;s shout didn&apos;t last long. &#xA0;Hyrkan, who was the owner of the sword, tripped the Pirest. &#xA0;The Priest face once again planted itself on the ground. &#xA0;Hyrkan put a foot into the back of the Pirest, and he pulled out his sword.</span></p><p><span style="">Then he stabbed with his sword again.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Huhk!&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">A surprised filled word came out of the Priest&apos;s mouth.</span></p><p><span style="">Of course, this sound wasn&apos;t emitted, because he was in pain. &#xA0;There was no pain in this game. &#xA0;Basically, it felt as if someone was poking him in the back with a finger. &#xA0;The level of pain he was experiencing shouldn&apos;t have made him afraid. &#xA0;&#xA0;If he would have surprised from being stabbed, he would have been surprised long before this.</span></p><p><span style="">So why was he surprised? </span></p><p><span style="">The reason....</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Isn&apos;t the damage it causes fantastic?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">The words came out of Hyrkan&apos;s mouth, and instead of answering, the Priest&apos;s body shook.</span></p><p><span style="">It had been a single light stab, yet the amount of HP he lost was beyond imagination. &#xA0;This was the reason why the Priest was terrified.</span></p><p><span style="">Dethroned Prince&apos;s Sword.</span></p><p><span style="">His reaction was befitting the strongest weapon in Warlord right now.</span></p><p><span style="">Poohk poohk! </span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan asked a question as he kept stabbing the Priest with his weapon.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Which guild are you affiliated with?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">The Priest didn&apos;t answer him. &#xA0;Instead of answering his question, the Priest was mumbling to himself.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;We encountered the Hahoe Mask, and I was caugh.......&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan stepped on the Priest&apos;s head. &#xA0;His mouth was pushed into the ground, so he couldn&apos;t speak.</span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan didn&apos;t have any more business with this User, so he kept stabbing at the Priest&apos;s body. &#xA0;One of the Mini Ogre Skeleton Warriors, who had wandered a bit away came back to help Hyrkan stab at the Priest&#x2019;s body.</span></p><p><span style="">While he was taking care of the Priest, he felt the consumption of his magical energy.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;They are worth their expensive price. &#xA0;They&apos;ve already caught up.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">It was proof that the Mini Ogre Skeleton Warriors had started their battle with other Users.</span></p><p><span style="">After he made sure the Priest was dead, Hyrkan flipped over the body. &#xA0;The Priest was wearing a white priest robe, but it was soiled by the dirt now. &#xA0;When he looked at the left corner of the Priest&apos;s chest, Hyrkan saw a symbol.</span></p><p><span style="">It was a circle, and there were two dots and a line within it.</span></p><p><span style="">The fresh smile was the symbol of the Big Smiles guild!</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Big Smiles.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">When Hyrkan confirmed the Priest&#x2019;s guild affiliation, he turned his head away. &#xA0;He didn&apos;t even bother taking his opponent&apos;s watch.</span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan only thought about how he&apos;ll get rid of his enemies.</span></p><p>3.</p><p><span style="">- We encountered the Hahoe Mask, and I was caugh&#xB7;&#xB7;&#xB7;&#xB7;&#xB7;&#xB7;. </span></p><p><span style="">- We are fighting with the Hahoe Mask right now, and it seems we are going to die.... </span></p><p><span style="">- I&apos;m sorry. &#xA0;We were taken down by the Hahoe Mask.</span></p><p><span style="">When he received the report from this advance party, Apollo unconsciously let out a shout.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;It&apos;s the Hahoe Mask again?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Apollo unconsciously spat out those words, and the surprised Users around him turned to look at him at the same time. &#xA0;Apollo frowned when he felt their gazes. &#xA0;In many ways, he wasn&#x2019;t in a good mood.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Why is this bastard keep blocking my way?&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">Apollo shut his mouth tight. &#xA0;He was irritated.</span></p><p><span style="">That was it. &#xA0;Apollo only got irritated. &#xA0;Unlike that time at the Frozen Land.... &#xA0;&#xA0;He didn&apos;t become drunk on his anger.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Shit.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">He didn&apos;t go rogue this time. &#xA0;He didn&apos;t give any orders. His temperament hadn&apos;t changed, but he was intelligent enough not to repeat a mistake.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;That fucking bastard.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What should we do? &#xA0;If we want to catch the Hahoe Mask...&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Catch him? &#xA0;Do you think we can catch him just because we want to?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Apollo shouted at his subordinate. &#xA0;&#xA0;He planned on immediately contacting Brooks. &#xA0;At this point, he needed the judgement and permission from the highest man in power. &#xA0;He couldn&#x2019;t do this on his own.</span></p><p><span style="">At that moment...</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;No.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">Apollo suddenly had a thought.</span></p><p><span style="">He knew who held the highest authority and true power in the Big Smiles guild. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">Apollo changed the person he was going to contact when he had this thought.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;It&apos;ll be faster if I contact Sinclair.&#x2019;</span></p>
