<p>Chapter 169 &#x2013; King&#x2019;s Tomb (2)</p><p>4.</p><p><span style="">The corridor was so well made that it was hard to call it a tunnel within a cave. &#xA0;There were checkered tiles on the ground akin to go boards. &#xA0;There was not a single tile out of place, and the surface of the walls in the semicircular tunnel was decorated with beautiful patterns.</span></p><p><span style="">It was a tunnel befitting a tomb of a king.</span></p><p><span style="">This was the last path traveled by a king. &#xA0;This was why this tunnel possessed extravagance, and it gave off a feeling of stately dignity.</span></p><p><span style="">[The Guardians, who guard the King&apos;s Tomb, is approaching you.] </span></p><p><span style="">The King&apos;s Tomb didn&apos;t allow anyone to enter it except for the king. &#xA0;It didn&apos;t look kindly to intruders.</span></p><p><span style="">Accompanying the System Announcement, soldiers made out of clay started to appear from the other side of the tunnel. &#xA0;They kept in formation as they marched forward. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">Chu-buhk, chubuhk!</span></p><p><span style="">The sounds of their feet moving in sync was heard. &#xA0;They marched towards the intruder, who had decided to interfere with the king&apos;s eternal sleep.</span></p><p><span style="">There were a lot of them. &#xA0;As expected of a road made for a king, the tunnel was large enough for 10 people to stand abreast of each other with their hands extended.. &#xA0;However, the clay soldiers made this tunnel feel cramped. </span></p><p><span style="">Twelves soldiers stood abreast of each other. &#xA0;Moreover, Hyrkan couldn&apos;t see the end of the line.</span></p><p><span style="">The only thing he was sure about was the fact that they numbered in the hundreds.</span></p><p><span style="">It was an incredibly large army.</span></p><p><span style="">Just imagining such a large army marching against oneself was enough to make anyone feel faint. &#xA0;Moreover, it was hard to even come up with a strategy to deal with such a large army. &#xA0;However, in such a situation, the User decided to charge forward. </span></p><p><span style="">Chuh-buhk! Chuh-buhk! </span></p><p><span style="">One could hear steps that were out of sync with the sound of footsteps made by several hundred clay soldiers marching together.</span></p><p><span style="">Pah-aht, pah-aht! </span></p><p><span style="">The sound of nimble footsteps could be heard.</span></p><p><span style="">The sound of the running footsteps and the slow marching footsteps alternated with each other.</span></p><p><span style="">Shweek!</span></p><p><span style="">In the middle of the alternating sounds, the sound of the air being split was heard.</span></p><p><span style="">Ssssk! </span></p><p><span style="">Then the sound of something solid being cut was heard.</span></p><p><span style="">Shweek, sssssk! </span></p><p><span style="">These sounds were heard in succession, and afterwards, the sound of something hard being hit was heard.</span></p><p><span style="">Ggah-ahng!</span></p><p><span style="">It was the start to the battle.</span></p><p><span style="">The battle started out in a noble fashion. &#xA0;A User threw his body towards a tunnel filled with several hundred Clay Soldiers. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">Wasn&apos;t this something that couldn&apos;t be done unless one had guts and a gallant spirit?</span></p><p><span style="">However, the result of such a gallant move wasn&apos;t that great. &#xA0;He was like a bulldozer. &#xA0;He sliced through the Clay Soldiers in front of him like tofu. &#xA0;He cut through everything without hesitation.</span></p><p><span style="">However, at some point, his gallant spirit couldn&apos;t overcome everything. &#xA0;He had charged straight into ranks of the endless Clay Soldiers, and now he was surrounded. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">The User was surrounded, and his headlong charge had come to a stop. &#xA0;Sharp swords were flying towards him at all sides, and the User displayed his ability.</span></p><p><span style="">The User had been in a desperately dangerous situation, and he could expect no outside help. &#xA0;The User had to solve the problem through his own power. </span></p><p><span style="">Che-ehng, cheng! </span></p><p><span style="">The unceasing sounds of swords clashing was heard, and at that moment, the User stabbed a sword into the ground.</span></p><p><span style="">The sword planted into the ground melted as it fountained forth liquid steel. &#xA0;The amount of liquid steel was much more than the amount making up the sword. &#xA0;It was an incredible amount.</span></p><p><span style="">Kwahl, kwahl! </span></p><p><span style="">The liquid steel, which poured out from the sword, didn&apos;t merely wet the floor. &#xA0;It started to overflow.</span></p><p><span style="">[Iron Golem was summoned.] </span></p><p><span style="">The overflowing liquid steel quickly formed into a 4 meter tall body. &#xA0;It turned into an enormous Golem made out of steel.</span></p><p><span style="">The Iron Golem appeared, and it immediately clogged the tunnel.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hardening!&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">The Iron Golem hardened in place as it became a wall blocking the tunnel.</span></p><p><span style="">Ggah-ahng, Ggah-ahng! &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">From the other side of the Iron Golem, one could hear the sound of swords being brought down in an attempt to destroy the Iron Golem. &#xA0;However, they could only attempt it. &#xA0;The Iron Golem didn&apos;t even let out a cry, and it didn&apos;t allow the monsters to wound its body easily.</span></p><p><span style="">The Users, who had been fighting solo, put his back against the Iron Golem.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hoo-ooh!&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">He was finally able to let out a sigh. &#xA0;As the User let out a sight, the corner of Hyrkan&apos;s mouth lifted.</span></p><p><span style="">Dahk dahk! </span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan immediately flicked his fingers. &#xA0;From where Hyrkan had come from, a group suddenly appeared.</span></p><p><span style="">The Death Knight stood in front of the group. &#xA0;It was followed by two Skeleton Knights and 10 Skeleton Warriors!</span></p><p><span style="">When the enemies appeared in the rear, a portion of the Clay Soldiers stopped pointing their swords toward Hyrkan, and they quickly turned towards the new group.</span></p><p><span style="">When he saw this sight, he regripped his Deposed Prince&apos;s Sword as he got ready to attack again. </span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;I&apos;ve been reaping only the benefits for awhile now. &#xA0;I guess I&#x2019;ll have to cough up some of it back now.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">King&apos;s Tomb.</span></p><p><span style="">When he entered the King&apos;s Tomb, &#xA0;he had waited for the guardians called the Clay Soldiers to show up.</span></p><p><span style="">Clay Soldiers. </span></p><p><span style="">It was a monster that appeared in the Ruined Kingdom episode. &#xA0;They were quite similar in nature to the Skeleton Warriors under his command. &#xA0;A fixed amount of damage was recovered as time progressed, and they didn&apos;t have a particular weakness that could be exploited. &#xA0;One had to give cumulative damage to kill it. &#xA0;It also had a pretty good Battle AI, and most importantly, they moved in a group numbering in the hundreds. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">When he saw that the Clay Soldiers were his opponents, Hyrkan immediately came up with a battle scenario.</span></p><p><span style="">The plan he was carrying out right now was that exact scenario.</span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan had waded into the unknown number of Clay Soldiers, and he had summoned the Iron Golem to make a wall. &#xA0;Then the Iron Golem was used to eliminate the divided forces of his enemies!</span></p><p><span style="">However, it was too inefficient to leave everything to his Skeleton underlings and the Golem.</span></p><p><span style="">Moreover, his Skeleton underlings were too unreserved in their attacks. &#xA0;His Skeleton underlings resembled Hyrkan, who had charged headlong into the ranks of the enemies. </span></p><p><span style="">At first, the Skeleton Warriors would be able to crush their enemies. &#xA0;However, the problem occurred afterwards. &#xA0;The Clay Soldiers would regain their original form in short order just like the Skeleton underlings!</span></p><p><span style="">If they weren&apos;t careful, the Skeleton underlings would be surrounded by the Clay Soldiers.</span></p><p><span style="">After being surrounded, his Skeleton underlings would put up a good fight. &#xA0;However, his magical energy would be the cost of letting such a frantic struggle occur.</span></p><p><span style="">He didn&apos;t know when this battle would end. &#xA0;However, if his magical energy bottomed out, it would be Hyrkan&apos;s defeat.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hoo-ooh!&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">This was why he chose this method. &#xA0;He wanted a more efficient, logical and wise battle tactic.</span></p><p><span style="">Of course, this would be hard. &#xA0;The Clay Soldier&#x2019;s combat ability didn&apos;t reflect their crude appearance. &#xA0;The swords were swung in a powerful and an intelligent manner. &#xA0;They didn&apos;t mindlessly hack and slash their opponents. &#xA0;When one stabbed, the others predicted how the enemy would respond. &#xA0;Then the other Clay Soldiers in line would stab their swords towards this predicted location with a bit of a time lag.</span></p><p><span style="">Usually, the prospect of being surrounded by the group of Clay Soldiers as a Striker would give one chills and nausea. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">However, at that moment, Hyrkan had a smile on his face.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;This fucking game.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">It was difficult. &#xA0;It was arduous. &#xA0;It was annoying.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Well, it is very Warlord-like.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">This was why it was fun.</span></p><p><span style="">It had always been like this. &#xA0;This was the reason why Hyrkan found Warlord fun, and this was also the reason why he kept playing it. &#xA0;If he couldn&apos;t feel such enjoyment from playing it, Hyrkan wouldn&apos;t have even bothered to start playing Warlord.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Stand tall.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Kahng kahng! </span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan patted the Iron Golem&#x2019;s body, which had become the strongest wall. &#xA0;Then he charged towards the Clay Soldiers.</span></p><p>5.</p><p><span style="">The very extravagant and clean tunnel leading to the tomb was filled with dirt. &#xA0;It was quite dirty.</span></p><p><span style="">It was the remains leftover when one thousand Clay Soldiers were killed.</span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan looked unsightly as he had just finished fighting a thousand Clay Soldiers. &#xA0;The Argardo&#x2019;s armor named the Dark Spot set boasted incredible defense, yet there were clear scratches on the armor. &#xA0;Some parts were broken, and other parts were smashed. &#xA0;It was evidence showing how fierce this battle had been.</span></p><p><span style="">[You are short on magical energy. &#xA0;The &apos;Undying&apos; Skill&apos;s effect is gone.] </span></p><p><span style="">When he stopped taking the consumable Items, his magic immediately bottomed out. &#xA0;He had been barely able to maintain his magical energy thanks to the recovery Items. &#xA0;This was a battle where he had reached his limit.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;This is the first time, since the Anugas Raid, where I might have died.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan had several near death experiences as he faced powerful monsters. &#xA0;Argardo, Immoral Prince, Frost Knight, Anugas....</span></p><p><span style="">These were unfathomable existences, and it wouldn&apos;t have been strange to see Hyrkan die at any of their hands.</span></p><p><span style="">However, he had almost experienced death by the sheer number of his enemies right now. &#xA0;&#xA0;It had been a while since he experienced such a thing.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;The difficulty of the game is higher than expected.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">In truth, Hyrkan hadn&apos;t realized the King&apos;s Tomb had such a high difficulty setting.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Whew..&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">The difficulty was higher than expected, and he had bled more than expected.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;I used up the consumable Items at twice the expected rate.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">When Hyrkan talked about bleeding, he was referring to his consumption of the consumable Items. &#xA0;Moreover, he had been in constant battle was 20 days, so he had a low stock of good consumable Items.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;No matter what, I have to go back after this.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">With the amount of consumable Items left, he would be able to conduct one more battle such as this one. </span></p><p><span style="">Still, Hyrkan could calculate the use of his consumable Items as a bleed rather than a critical wound.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;This was possible, because it was me. &#xA0;A decent party &#xA0;of 10 to 20 members would have never been able to break through this place.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">If it was a party of normal Users, over half their numbers would have experienced Game Over.</span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan was astonished by the difficulty of the game.</span></p><p><span style="">At the same time, he was satisfied with it.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Yes. &#xA0;It is possible, because I&#x2019;m me.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">From Hyrkan&apos;s perspective, the King&apos;s Tomb had been one of most difficult locations in terms of difficulty. &#xA0;The crux of the difficulty was the fact that this stage was meant to be overcome with the cooperation of numerous Users. &#xA0;On the other hand, the reward should reflect this difficulty.</span></p><p><span style="">Since he had cleared this place by himself, Hyrkan was well qualified to take the rewards for himself.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Yes. &#xA0;I&#x2019;ll monopolize this place.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">He was qualified to be able to reap the numerous rewards by himself.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;This is a King&apos;s Tomb. Of course, there will be more here. &#xA0;At the very least, it should have a Unique Rank Item set. &#xA0;Moreover, there should be two to three scrolls of Ancient Power. &#xA0;They are making the User go through such hardship. &#xA0;There is no way a single Skill Book would be given as a Quest Reward.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan smiled as he put the Golden Conch to his ear. &#xA0;At that moment, the Golden Conch started speaking again.</span></p><p><span style="">- Forward&#xB7;&#xB7;&#xB7;&#xB7;&#xB7;&#xB7;. </span></p><p><span style="">The Golden Conch gave the direction, and Hyrkan moved with a Skeleton Warrior in front of him. &#xA0;The Death Knight followed behind Hyrkan, and the rest of the Skeleton Underlings followed the Death Knight as if it was the mother duck.</span></p><p><span style="">How long did they walk for?</span></p><p><span style="">The tunnel came to an end, and a large space was revealed. &#xA0;In the large space, there was a single altar. &#xA0;Moreover, there were 4 entrances with the altar at its center, and Hyrkan had exited from one of these entrances.</span></p><p><span style="">[You&apos;ve completed &#x2018;Trace of Bokan&#x2019; Quest.] </span></p><p><span style="">At that moment, he heard the Announcement telling him he had completed the Quest.</span></p><p><span style="">The Quest had come to an end, and he had to go back to report what he had found. &#xA0;If he went back to Ahimbree, he would be able to get the reward.</span></p><p><span style="">However, Hyrkan wasn&apos;t satisfied with such a result.</span></p><p><span style="">Wasn&apos;t this the King&apos;s Tomb? &#xA0;This incredible tomb was made for a king. &#xA0;The king wouldn&#x2019;t have been sent to his grave empty handed. &#xA0;At the very least, they would have filled the tomb with gold and gems as a sign of respect.</span></p><p><span style="">No, he was sure of this fact.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;This can&apos;t be the end. &#xA0;There has to be something more to this.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan once again put the Golden Conch to his ear.</span></p><p><span style="">- I&apos;ve discovered the tomb of a king. &#xA0;I don&apos;t know which king is buried here, but there are signs that indicate that this king had fought against the Dragon&apos;s Army. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">At that moment, the Golden Conch started to tell a long story unlike before.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Yes. &#xA0;There is no way this could be the end.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan listened carefully.</span></p><p><span style="">- This was why I believed everything within this place would be of help in facing the Dragon&#x2019;s Army. &#xA0;I sent everything within this place to the great Blacksmith Olf.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Uh?&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">As he heard the story, Hyrkan&apos;s expression crumpled.</span></p><p><span style="">- New heroes will emerge, and I tasked him to make equipments for those that will fill face the Dragon&#x2019;s Army in the future. &#xA0;I also gave him a key I found here for safekeeping.</span></p><p><span style="">The story ended there.</span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan detached the Golden Conch from his ear, then he shook it couple times before putting it next to his ear again.</span></p><p><span style="">- I&apos;ve discovered the tomb.... </span></p><p><span style="">When the same message started to flow out, Hyrkan let out a shout. </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;For real? &#xA0;Fuck!&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">According to Bokan&#x2019;s story, the King&#x2019;s Tomb had been filled with incredible Items as expected of a resting place for a king. &#xA0;However, Archmage Bokan had decided to send all the Items here, so it could be converted into Items that&#x2019;ll be used to fight the Dragon&#x2019;s Army. &#xA0;It was all sent to the Blacksmith Olf. &#xA0;This was the gist of the story.</span></p><p><span style="">Basically, there was nothing to be gained here. &#xA0;Everything worth having here had been given to the care of the Blacksmith Olf. </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Wow! &#xA0;Wow!&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">At that moment, Hyrkan was so mad that he was having a hard time expressing his anger.</span></p><p><span style="">At that moment, Hyrkan heard a new System Announcement in his ears.</span></p><p><span style="">[Quest &#x2018;Ancient King&#x2019;s Artifact&#x2019; is starting.] </span></p><p><span style="">[Quest &#x2018;Ancient King&#x2019;s Test&#x2019; has started.] </span></p><p><span style="">[The king&#x2019;s Guardian Knights are starting to move.] </span></p><p><span style="">Koo-koo-koo! </span></p><p><span style="">As if it had been waiting for the Announcement, the King&#x2019;s Tomb rumbled as if it was about to collapse. &#xA0;At that moment, Hyrkan remembered the large statue of knights decorating the entrance of cave.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Shit!&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Moreover, the scene of him fighting these enormous sculptures of knights popped up within his head.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;It seems all my bad imaginations comes to pass.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">Hyrkan&#x2019;s instinct regarding this point was quite good.</span></p><p>6.</p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Thank you for your hard work..&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Thank you for your hard work.!&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Good job, everyone!&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">The words of encouragement was heard coming out from various sources. &#xA0;These messages were also the signal that notified the battle had come to an end. &#xA0;It also told the other Users that they could relax and they could take a break.</span></p><p><span style="">However, not all members could relax and rest. &#xA0;It was the opposite. &#xA0;Some Users ramped up their activities.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Did you see the mural?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;We&apos;ve recorded everything.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What about the hidden room?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;We are exhausting all methods to research it.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Don&apos;t miss a single clue. &#xA0;Even if you have to work overtime, I want you to be thorough.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Natal had participated in the battle, and he had performed very well. &#xA0;It wouldn&#x2019;t be shocking if he fell over from exhaustion, yet he was also bustling into action. &#xA0;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">This place was a ruin called the Tomb of the Heroes, and he was looking over the footage regarding the mural. </span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;We&apos;ve finally found a clue that&apos;ll give us the big picture regarding this Main Scenario Quest.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">Usually, the Hydra guild moved faster through the Main Scenario Quest compared to the other guilds.</span></p><p><span style="">However, this wasn&apos;t true in the third Main Scenario Quest. &#xA0;They had a very late start. &#xA0;This was why they didn&apos;t have the time to rest, and they couldn&apos;t afford any mistakes.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;We need to see the big picture. &#xA0;That&#x2019;s important.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">Most Users would have ignored the murals, but Natal would put his brain to work to find clues.</span></p><p><span style="">- Natal-nim! &#xA0;There is a mural on the ceiling. &#xA0;You should have a look at it.</span></p><p><span style="">One of the Users investigating the Ruin called out to Natal. &#xA0;Natal immediately headed towards the User. &#xA0;Natal arrived at a room.</span></p><p><span style=""> There was a memorial stone in the middle of the room.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Over there.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">The User, who called Natal over, pointed towards the ceiling over the memorial stone.</span></p><p><span style="">As he had indicated, there was a mural on the ceiling.</span></p><p><span style="">The mural&apos;s content was quite simple.</span></p><p><span style="">The mural was divided in half.</span></p><p><span style="">On one side, there was an enormous Dragon, and there were all kinds of monsters in front of the Dragon.</span></p><p><span style="">The monsters were staring towards the other half of the mural where a castle was present. &#xA0;There were numerous humans gathered in front of the castle with their weapons raised . &#xA0;Moreover, five warriors, who were letting out various Aurae, stood in front of the army.</span></p><p><span style="">When he saw the content of the mural, Natal spoke in a low voice.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I&#x2019;m not sure on anything else, but I&#x2019;m sure our final enemy will be the Dragon&#x2019;s Army.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Nothing. &#xA0;I was talking to myself. &#xA0;First, let&#x2019;s take footage of the mural then the memorial stone&#x2026; &#xA0;Could you try lifting it?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ah. &#xA0;I&apos;m a Priest. &#xA0;My Strength stat is....&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hurry up and call in a Striker. &#xA0;After we finish our work&#x2026;. &#xA0;Let&#x2019;s destroy all the murals as a precaution.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes. &#xA0;Understood.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">After the conversation, a bitter laugh came out of Natal.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;It seems it won&apos;t be long before Warlord reverts into being a normal game like all the other games on the market.&#x2019;</span></p>
