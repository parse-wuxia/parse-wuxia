<p><strong>&#xA0;Chapter 24. The Saint&#x2019;s Repayment</strong></p><p>I wish I can get a cold beer&#x2026; It&#x2019;s quite boring living as a corpse. I can&#x2019;t feel anything, which made it feel like I was in a permanent dream. I sat down on my chair and took out a book from the vault. Now, time for some read&#x2026;</p><p>&#x201C;Snore...&#x201D;</p><p>Is Necro snoring already? He falls asleep quick&#x2026; I punched the wall facing his room several times, closed my book, and went outside. The first floor was quite loud as well, so I guess I&#x2019;m forced to go to the stables.</p><p>&#x201C;This is nice.&#x201D;</p><p>Excluding the occasional sound of the horses, it was actually pretty quiet here. I could see the moon up above as well, through the hole in the ceiling. I checked the haystack for any horse dung, and lay down on it. Now, I&#x2019;ll go back to my reading session&#x2026;</p><p>&#x201C;Ah! Found you! So you were here after all.&#x201D;</p><p>The saint approached me with a smile on her face.</p><p>&#x201C;I found you. I thought you escaped again and got scared, you know?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Necro snores too loudly.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Aha.&#x201D;</p><p>I stood back up.</p><p>&#x201C;What do you need?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Mm&#x2026; Well...&#x201D;</p><p>The saint seemed to think of something for a second, then brightened up the moment she thought of something.</p><p>&#x201C;Pop quiz! Annyeong, hak! Sei, nyo! Oo?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;......&#x201D;</p><p>What was this idiot going on about?</p><p>&#x201C;What quiz?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Annyeong, hak! Sei, nyo! Oo?&#x201D;</p><p>The words that I heard, and the meanings that I understood from it, were completely different. This must be thanks to Xenoglossy. Annyeong meant hi in Korean. Hak must be a part of the work wisaeng-hak, meaning hygiene. Sei meant holy? Ah, must be &#x305B;&#x3044;(&#x8056;). Nyo is &#x5973;(&#x306B;&#x3087;), so sei and nyo together would mean saint. In other words.</p><p>&lt;Hello, Jin. Saint, OO?&gt;</p><p>She thought of quite an interesting wordplay.</p><p>&#x201C;Hello.&#x201D;</p><p>&lt;Go to hell.&gt;(Hell, Lo (to))</p><p>The saint made a disappointed face when I told her the translation.</p><p>&#x201C;That last part is supposed to be hai, isn&#x2019;t it? Because there are two circles.&#x201D;</p><p>She must&#x2019;ve wanted to hear me say her name. All the more reason not to say it.</p><p>&#x201C;Let&#x2019;s try again. &#x306F;&#x3044;(hi), hi(hello), &#x6D77;(sea)&#x2019;s high hai(shark)!&#x201D;</p><p>They were all pronounced as &#x2018;hai&#x2019;.</p><p>&#x201C;You mean hai(&#x5BB3;, harmful)...&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Just say my name already! Morto hai! It&#x2019;s simple! Might as well read it as Motto high (very high)!&#x201D;</p><p>I didn&#x2019;t see the worth in saying her name.</p><p>&#x201C;It&#x2019;s a fake name though.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;It&#x2019;s a name given by god.&#x201D;</p><p>Necro was talking about that. Because wizards couldn&#x2019;t reveal their true name, they needed to use names that god gave them.</p><p>&#x201C;And your real name?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Why don&#x2019;t you try guessing?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Heisenberg?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Wrong~&#x201D;</p><p>If it&#x2019;s a German name&#x2026;</p><p>&#x201C;Hailey? Hilda? Heidi?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;9! 9!! 9!!!&#x201D;</p><p>Wordplay on nein(no)&#x2026;</p><p>&#x201C;Whatever. What did you really come here for anyway? To watch me? I&#x2019;m not going to run you know.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;I came here to heal you. You got an injury on your back didn&#x2019;t you?&#x201D;</p><p>She seemed to be talking about the injuries I got from the waiting room.</p><p>&#x201C;It&#x2019;s fine. It&#x2019;s not anything big. Plus, I don&#x2019;t get favors from cultists.&#x201D;</p><p>The saint seemed confused.</p><p>&#x201C;Um&#x2026; Did you just call me a cultist?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Don&#x2019;t try to deny it. It even said it in the books? &#x2018;Healing magic can be cast by anyone once they form a contract with god, but in order to use it well, one must acquire proper medical knowledge.&#x2019;&#x201D;</p><p>This was because one could only heal after recognizing the problem in the injury. There were tens of thousands of spells under a single category of healing magic. Injuries don&#x2019;t get healed just by muttering some spells. Life was more complicated than that.</p><p>&#x201C;I can&#x2019;t let someone who isn&#x2019;t even a doctor to handle my body. Go away, fake.&#x201D;</p><p>I looked at the saint suspiciously on purpose. While pointing to a certain sentence in a book highlighted in red.</p><p>[There are lucky cases where a patient does get healed, but more often than not the patient would die because of a wrong usage of healing magic. Always be careful of unlicensed healers.]</p><p>My life is on stake. I have to be careful. Well, I was already dead, but still.</p><p>&#x201C;Ah, I was wondering about what you were worried about.&#x201D;</p><p>The saint walked over to me with a smile on her face.</p><p>&#x201C;Just get over here already. I&#x2019;m going to jump you if you don&#x2019;t? Do you really want there to be violence involved?&#x201D;</p><p>I didn&#x2019;t think I&#x2019;d be sentenced to death even in a different world.</p><p>&#x201C;Come at me, psycho.&#x201D;</p><p>I raised my two hands like a bear and began to walk around the saint threateningly.</p><p>&#x201C;I couldn&#x2019;t get my license because I came from a different world, but I managed to get a proper education as a medical student in college. Isn&#x2019;t that enough?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Liar. You said you were a high schooler.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Early admissions.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;So you aren&#x2019;t even a high schooler then. Liar.&#x201D;</p><p>The saint stepped back with a &#x201C;kuh&#x201D;. I sent out the final blow.</p><p>&#x201C;A wizard who isn&#x2019;t even a doctor trying to heal people by praying or something? Must be quite a sight. Do you need to sacrifice a pig&#x2019;s head or something?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;I&#x2019;ve never seen an idiot who talks about stuff like that other than you, Mr. Murderer.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;The one who says &#x2018;yes&#x2019; to a person who offers to heal with magic with the idiot here. You can get scammed quite easily.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;You believe in the existence of magic, but you don&#x2019;t trust in my healing magic itself?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;I have trust issues.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Just get healed already.&#x201D;</p><p>Tap.</p><p>The saint disappeared from view. Physical enhancement? I tried to run immediately, but got tackled from behind.</p><p>&#x201C;Stay down. It&#x2019;ll just take a second.&#x201D;</p><p>The saint whispered this into my ear while she held me down.</p><p>&#x201C;It&#x2019;ll only hurt the first time. Don&#x2019;t worry, I&#x2019;ll be nice.&#x201D;</p><p>Uaaah!</p><p>The saint whose body had been enhanced by magic wasn&#x2019;t something that could be beaten by human means. In the end, I gave up and decided to lay down on the floor.</p><p>&#x201C;Do what you want.&#x201D;</p><p>I had pulled out the knives in my back, but didn&#x2019;t seal it up yet. She must be trying to fix that up now.</p><p>&#x201C;I&#x2019;ll start now?&#x201D;</p><p>The saint began to mutter her spell whilst she sat on my back. I could hear a pleasant whisper in my ear while my back began to warm up. I was sweating quite a bit from the heat.</p><p>How light.</p><p>I used my eyes to take a look at the saint. She was whispering a few words under her breath with her eyes closed. She must be praying about now. ASMR white magic&#x2026; It isn&#x2019;t too bad, I suppose.</p><p>I modified my view a little bit again.</p><p>I could see white mana flowing out of the saint&#x2019;s body. I became mesmerized by the sight for a slight second, then returned to my senses after hearing something.</p><p>Shf. Shfshf.</p><p>&#x201C;...What are you doing?&#x201D;</p><p>Shf.</p><p>The saint was drawing something on my arm after she had finished using healing magic. I thought she was drawing a magic circle at first, but she was just doodling.</p><p>&#x201C;This left arm has a black dragon sealed insi...&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;You!&#x201D;</p><p>I tore off the leech off of my back. The saint blew back onto the haystack.</p><p>&#x201C;You can draw on your sketchbook.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Ever heard of charms?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Never saw or heard of a charm that resembled anything like this.&#x201D;</p><p>I waved the saint away like I was waving away a fly.</p><p>&#x201C;Now, now. Just leave already. I&#x2019;m thankful for healing me, but it&#x2019;s time for children to sleep now. It&#x2019;d be troublesome if you got shorter than you already are from a lack of sleep. After all, I&#x2019;d have to use a microscope to see you if you get smaller than you are already.&#x201D;</p><p>The saint didn&#x2019;t budge.</p><p>&#x201C;I refuse.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Damn it!&#x201D;</p><p>The girl just refused to move from her spot. I tried to move her by hand, but my hand ended up hurting because of the holy flame. I gave up and decided to ignore her and read. The saint approached me when she saw this.</p><p>&#x201C;Studying magic again? You can&#x2019;t even use mana though.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;I have to keep learning if I want to keep winning. I might not be able to use it, but it&#x2019;s not worthless information.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;...Why did someone like you end up killing?&#x201D;</p><p>The saint quickly closed her mouth, thinking that she said something she shouldn&#x2019;t have said.</p><p>A person like me&#x2026;</p><p>I would love it if there were more people like me. Even now, I&#x2019;ve done everything I could just to blend into society. I&#x2019;ve told people only the simplest side to my thoughts and explained everything about what I thought to people that I&#x2019;ve met. If there were two of me, I would exchange thousands of words with myself to transmit information between each other.</p><p>&#x201C;What? Did you think I was just a complete psychopath?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Well&#x2026; Yes.&#x201D;</p><p>How honest.</p><p>&#x201C;I&#x2019;m a normal person.&#x201D;</p><p>That was a lie.</p><p>&#x201C;I couldn&#x2019;t help but murder.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Liar.&#x201D;</p><p>She seemed quite confident in her denial.</p><p>&#x201C;I&#x2019;ve actually investigated you quite a bit in my free time.&#x201D;</p><p>When?</p><p>She shouldn&#x2019;t have had a lot of time. I was with her most of the time after I&#x2019;ve revealed my abilities to her, after all.</p><p>...Other than that one time when she had to go see the fairy.</p><p>The saint sat down.</p><p>&#x201C;You might&#x2019;ve not known, but I know a person who is able to &#x2018;attain information just through key words&#x2019;. I asked him about you, and learned quite a bit as a result.&#x201D;</p><p>A search engine&#x2026;</p><p>Seems likely that it would exist. If one could search for products, I suppose there would be a power that could search for information as well.</p><p>&#x201C;What did you learn?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;About Whitehead. Where you were born.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;I told you everything I know. What about it?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;What happened there? How did you turn into a murderer? Surely you could&#x2019;ve done something else.&#x201D;</p><p>The saint seemed a little regretful as she said this, but I couldn&#x2019;t agree with her at all. A different path? Could a human that was fascinated by killing creatures end up being anything other than a murderer?</p><p>Instead of answering the saint&#x2019;s question, I quietly began to reminisce about my past.</p><p></p><hr><p></p>
