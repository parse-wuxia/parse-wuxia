<p><strong>Chapter 68. Epilogue</strong></p><p>Today&#x2019;s an important day. I paid more attention to my hair than I usually did and took out a suit from the vault. A gift that she gave to me some time in the past.</p><p>&#x201C;...Seems a tad bit strange, doesn&#x2019;t it?&#x201D;</p><p>Well, I&#x2019;ll get used to it. I fixed my tie one last time in the mirror. I checked for any dust on my suit. I needed to be perfect today.</p><p>Can&#x2019;t make any mistakes this time.</p><p>I walked down from the library down to the first floor. I stopped for a second to look at the kitchen. Thinking of the adventure we shared made me smile uncontrollably.</p><p>I walked forward.</p><p>Once I opened the door, I was greeted with a shower of warm sunlight. It was spring. Already a year and three months had passed since that incident.</p><p>I worked quite hard during that time.</p><p>I absorbed Necro&#x2019;s magic.</p><p>I turned the entire world against me.</p><p>I ran around everywhere trying to deal with the mess I&#x2019;d made. And finally, I was ready to meet her.</p><p>&#x201C;I wonder if I&#x2019;m too late&#x2026;?&#x201D;</p><p>I walked the spring path laid out before me. The town was busy with workers running around rebuilding the destroyed buildings. We should be able to get a functioning country up and running in about three years. I was planning on helping them as much as possible from the sidelines in the process. I looked down at the town that &#x201C;we&#x201D; were to live in and moved high up in the sky.</p><p>A beautiful view was laid out before me.</p><p>The location where the castle used to be had turned into a giant crater that had filled with seawater, turning into a bay of sorts. The dead earth that used to be the Haze Republic was now being dotted with patches of plants.</p><p>Even with a tragedy like that, the world was still moving on peacefully. Towards a better world for everyone, like she said.</p><p>&#x201C;...I think I can do it now.&#x201D;</p><p>My heart had calmed enough. I moved to the edge of the country and was greeted with a field of spring flowers. Starting from linden viburnums, laurels, all the way to forget-me-nots. Almost all the spring flowers seemed to have been gathered here. In the middle of the field was a magnolia tree that had fully bloomed.</p><p>I wonder if she&#x2019;s still waiting? Maybe she left after having waited for such a long time&#x2026;</p><p>Sha----.</p><p>A pleasant zephyr swept through the field of flowers, causing a wave of flowers to float up into the air. I looked up into the sky as I walked. A single magnolia petal was dancing above me.</p><p>In front of this beautiful sight, I could only think of one thing.</p><p>Really.</p><p>I was lucky to be born in this world----.</p><p>&#x201C;Aliyah Herz.&#x201D;</p><p>Now, let us be happy together. If we are to make a happy world, the first person who needs to become happy is you.</p><p>&#x201C;----Heart of Gold.&#x201D;</p><p>A question appeared in front of me.</p><p>&lt;You&#x2019;ve selected [Life]. Will you purchase it? Y/N&gt;</p><p>If there was one thing that I would wish for, it was her happiness. I answered the question with a smile.</p><p><img data-cfsrc="https://cdn.wuxiaworld.com/uploads/ensj/im-sorry-for-being-born-in-this-world/images/cgjzhys2.yto.png" data-cfstyle="width: 553px" class="fr-fic fr-dib" style="display:none;visibility:hidden;"><noscript><img src="https://cdn.wuxiaworld.com/uploads/ensj/im-sorry-for-being-born-in-this-world/images/cgjzhys2.yto.png" style="width: 553px" class="fr-fic fr-dib"></noscript></p><p><img data-cfsrc="https://cdn.wuxiaworld.com/uploads/ensj/im-sorry-for-being-born-in-this-world/images/wmekkz0h.dry.png" data-cfstyle="width: 550px" class="fr-fic fr-dib" style="display:none;visibility:hidden;"><noscript><img src="https://cdn.wuxiaworld.com/uploads/ensj/im-sorry-for-being-born-in-this-world/images/wmekkz0h.dry.png" style="width: 550px" class="fr-fic fr-dib"></noscript></p><p>&#x201C;----Yes, please.&#x201D;</p><p><br></p><p style="text-align: right">Thank you for this world.</p><p>&lt;I&#x2019;m Sorry For Being Born In This World, &#x5B8C;&gt;</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><hr><p><br></p>
