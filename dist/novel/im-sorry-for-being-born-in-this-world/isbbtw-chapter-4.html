<p><strong>Chapter 4. The Immoral Act You Were Summoned To Do</strong></p><p>Thirst? Hunger? His HP was low for someone at level 8. After looking at the Necro&#x2019;s equipment, I realized something. If one&#x2019;s item did not have any stats, or an added effect, the item didn&#x2019;t show up in the status screen. For example, normal t-shirts, underwear, or socks would not show up.</p><p>&#x201C;Have you gotten used to your new additions yet?&#x201D;</p><p>There were quite a lot more things that I would&#x2019;ve liked to look at, but I probably didn&#x2019;t have the time for it.</p><p>&#x201C;Thanks to you.&#x201D;</p><p>I decided to observe the man while being as subdued as possible. This was because &#x2018;despite having this happen, no one came&#x2019;. Meaning, the current situation was totally under control. Or, this was the &#x2018;intended conclusion&#x2019;.</p><p>&#x201C;Thank my ass. How polite. By the way, this isn&#x2019;t entirely free? You cleaned up the kids, and this is also an advance payment for something I&#x2019;m going to ask you to do.&#x201D;</p><p>There was a high chance of me being dead when I was summoned. In other words, the man had summoned &#x201C;me&#x201D; as a target. And he was also &#x201C;desperate&#x201D; enough to revive me. But if I was that important, I surely would&#x2019;ve been treated better than this.</p><p>&#x201C;O.K. Alright. Now we can talk. Let me introduce myself again.&#x201D;</p><p>Necro extended his hand to me.</p><p>&#x201C;I am Necro, one of the wizards working for the Haze Republic.&#x201D;</p><p>Necro Kill. [To kill a corpse]. We shook our hands.</p><p>&#x201C;Cool name, don&#x2019;t you think? I&#x2019;m the one who summoned you here! As well as the one who revived you! Hahaha!&#x201D;</p><p>His laughter was filled with pride and joy.</p><p>&#x201C;Saying this makes me sound almost like a villain? How embarrassing.&#x201D;</p><p>If one took blood and corpses out of the equation, the whole scene seemed almost light-hearted and fun. Now it&#x2019;s my turn to introduce myself, huh.</p><p>&#x201C;Jin.&#x201D;</p><p>I decided to use my family name, since I didn&#x2019;t have an actual name.</p><p>&#x201C;Jin? And?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Nothing else.&#x201D;</p><p>I wasn&#x2019;t lying.</p><p>&#x201C;Oh dear. No name? Were you a part of an evil organization or something?&#x201D;</p><p>Kind of.</p><p>&#x201C;As for you, why are you called Necro Kill, despite being a Korean? Chuuni, perhaps?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Hey! Damn you! Chuuni my ass. This all has a reason, you know? Wizards aren&#x2019;t supposed to reveal their true name, you know? If you know a wizard&#x2019;s true name, you can do all sorts of stuff to their magic and existence itself. Get it?&#x201D;</p><p>I didn&#x2019;t get it.</p><p>&#x201C;Don&#x2019;t tell me you&#x2019;re making up stories just because I have no name...&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Ehei! That&#x2019;s not the case at all!&#x201D;</p><p>It seemed that the world of wizards was quite peculiar.</p><p>&#x201C;Well, fine. I&#x2019;ll tell you my name, but my surname, then. Just for politeness&#x2019; sake. But do try to forget it after you hear it, yeah?&#x201D;</p><p>A name was just a name, after all.</p><p>&#x201C;Seokil. O.K. I&#x2019;ll stop there.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Kill because Seo&#x2019;kil&#x2019;?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Ah, I suppose it would work that way? Creative, aren&#x2019;t you. Ah, I&#x2019;m saying this just now, but it&#x2019;s useless to know my surname? You can&#x2019;t just know my name without knowing the meaning behind it.&#x201D;</p><p>But I already got through that problem. In this case, this was simply a case of breaking up a single character into multiple pieces.</p><p>&#x201C;What a rare surname.&#x201D;</p><p>Necro&#x2019;s face stiffened.</p><p>&#x201C;It&#x2019;s Japanese if you read it backwards, too.&#x201D;</p><p>I didn&#x2019;t even need to check if I was right. The man&#x2019;s reaction was quite something.</p><p>&#x201C;Don&#x2019;t worry. I won&#x2019;t tell.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;...I&#x2019;m not gonna trust you, but seriously, don&#x2019;t tell anyone that. Alright? In any case. It&#x2019;s getting kind of awkward to just stay here, so- let&#x2019;s go.&#x201D;</p><p>Necro motioned me out the door.</p><p>&#x201C;We need to get you through the proper motions. Gotta get you introduced to a few people as well. We can talk more as we move.&#x201D;</p><p>I pointed towards the corpses.</p><p>&#x201C;Those?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Ah, them? Don&#x2019;t worry about it. It&#x2019;s just trash anyway. Over there, that Smelter kid. He used to go around with a knife stabbing kids. Below him, Steal More was someone who stole other kids&#x2019; stuff and took out cash from his parents&#x2019; wallets. Grand Cheat was someone who just cheated on every one of his tests. What do you think, they all deserved death, don&#x2019;t you think?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Who knows.&#x201D;</p><p>The problem lay in whether they could&#x2019;ve &#x2018;benefited me&#x2019;.</p><p>&#x201C;Oh~ how cool~&#x201D;</p><p>Necro walked over to one of the corpses.</p><p>&#x201C;Seriously, how nice. Just look at these sons of bitches. Isn&#x2019;t the world quite a shitty place? To think shits like these could run wild after they come to this world.&#x201D;</p><p>Necro crouched down next to Grand Cheat&#x2019;s split head.</p><p>&#x201C;They don&#x2019;t even have shit in their brains, and yet they have the gall to call themselves geniuses.&#x201D;</p><p>Necro took out a knife from his pocket. It was a Chinese cleaver. But instead of the usual plastic case it was contained in, it seemed to be covered in some dirty pieces of flesh.</p><p>&#x201C;You think you&#x2019;re a wizard? You thought if a piece of trash in real life came over to this world, you would be a hero?&#x201D;</p><p>Necro chopped off Grand Cheat&#x2019;s neck with the cleaver. The limbs convulsed a little bit as blood seeped out of the neck.</p><p>So he was pretending to be dead&#x2026;</p><p>The kid used his ability to make the axe miss, and used his ability to make my eyes register a &#x2018;miss&#x2019; as a &#x2018;hit&#x2019;.</p><p>I should be more careful.</p><p>&#x201C;The only thing they try to do is make their lives more comfortable. The abilities aren&#x2019;t even something they earned by themselves, and yet they feel overly proud of it. See, there&#x2019;s too many people like these nowadays? Really, we should&#x2019;ve held back on summoning people.&#x201D;</p><p>Necro put down the cleaver down on the ground, and stood up. Only then did the creature within open its mouth, and let out an inhuman scream.</p><p>[Cannibalistic Butcher = Gebesh]</p><p>- Rank: C-</p><p>- A butchering knife that came from a different world. It is a cursed weapon, so it is well-advised to take caution when using it. Gebesh chooses its owner.</p><p>- &lt;Greedy Meat&gt; Those who gets cut by this knife begins to emit a delicious odor. This smell can be smelt even tens of kilometers away.</p><p>- &lt;Eternal Icehouse&gt; The stomach of this beast is connected to a different dimension, allowing it to store a large quantity of meat without getting it to rot. The beast can throw up the meat inside whenever requested to do so by the owner.</p><p>Gebesh, who revealed its centipede-like legs, began to eat the flesh of Grand Cheat.</p><p>It almost looked like the flesh was being vacuumed into the beast.</p><p>So this is black magic&#x2026;</p><p>&#x201C;Let&#x2019;s see. She was a member of the archery club, and that&#x2019;s a cult member. Oh, you see that blood stain over there?&#x201D;</p><p>I could see a black stain.</p><p>&#x201C;These kids took one of their classmates and injured her, healed her, then injured her again. All for the sake of levelling up, they said. Seriously, is this something that a human should do?&#x201D;</p><p>Level up&#x2026;</p><p>It should be possible to level up like that if this world really was like a game.</p><p>&#x201C;The kid had turned into a hedgehog by the time I found her corpse.&#x201D;</p><p>The bow could&#x2019;ve been made with Smelter&#x2019;s ability, but what about the bowstring? I adjusted the Floating Eye to observe the bow. The bowstring&#x2019;s color and shine was quite familiar. Black and shiny, this was almost like&#x2026;</p><p>A strand of hair&#x2026;</p><p>She must&#x2019;ve cut it off of her dead classmate.</p><p>&#x201C;I asked them why they killed the student, and they said they weren&#x2019;t even at fault. In fact, they even said &#x2018;don&#x2019;t you just revive when you die?&#x2019; Dear lord.&#x201D;</p><p>Necro laughed angrily.</p><p>&#x201C;Do people&#x2019;s brains begin rotting when they come over to this world or something?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Who knows.&#x201D;</p><p>They must&#x2019;ve been thinking something along the lines of this:</p><p>[Once you die, you revive. Therefore, death is no longer something of concern.]</p><p>I don&#x2019;t agree with the idea that death is insignificant, but it does make sense that the students would think such a thing. The existence of Necromancy proves life after death, and the theory of souls. This means that reincarnation might actually exist. Perhaps gods, ghosts, and monsters exist here as well.</p><p>Soon enough, the cleanup became finished. When Necro extended his hand, Gebesh jumped into it like a happy puppy. There were only skeletons left in the room. Even those got eaten away by Necro&#x2019;s other tools. The only proof that the kids from before existed in this world were the bloodstains on the room.</p><p>&#x201C;We&#x2019;re done here. Let&#x2019;s leave. The rest can be cleaned up by my assistant.&#x201D;</p><p>Necro, who had been walking towards the exit, suddenly turned around.</p><p>&#x201C;Ah, before that, mind if I ask a question?&#x201D;</p><p>Does he have something left to do?</p><p>&#x201C;It&#x2019;s a little strange coming from me, but why&#x2019;d you kill them? They were youngsters, after all. Perhaps it would&#x2019;ve been better for you to suck it up? Were you mad because they killed someone? Or because they tried to pick a fight? Or woke you up?&#x201D;</p><p>It wasn&#x2019;t like I had a anger management problem. I wouldn&#x2019;t kill someone because of just that.</p><p>&#x201C;No, it was because of Smelter.&#x201D;</p><p>Necro&#x2019;s eyebrows bunched up together after hearing my simple answer.</p><p>&#x201C;Smelter? Did he pick a fight?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;No, it was his &#x2018;ability&#x2019;.&#x201D;</p><p>Necro seemed even more confused.</p><p>&#x201C;Think about it. Smelter has the ability to extract metal from materials to create something, correct?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Correct.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;If that ability has time to mature, it should be able to mine various metals as well, don&#x2019;t you think?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Well&#x2026; there is that probability, I suppose.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;It might bring harm to my ability, Heart of Gold. I don&#x2019;t know what the ability is, but seeing how it has the word gold in it, I found it fitting to dispose of Smelter while I still could.&#x201D;</p><p>Necro grinned.</p><p>&#x201C;...Just because of that?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;It&#x2019;s important for &#x2018;me&#x2019;.&#x201D;</p><p>Why couldn&#x2019;t anyone understand? Necro lifted his hands like an orchestra director.</p><p>&#x201C;Right. Let&#x2019;s get things straight. So. You felt that Smelter&#x2019;s ability could endanger you in the future, so you killed him? Sort of like an investment?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Correct.&#x201D;</p><p>Necro&#x2019;s lips were trembling with excitement now.</p><p>&#x201C;You&#x2019;re crazier than me, aren&#x2019;t you?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;The doctor said I was fine.&#x201D;</p><p>I was lying.</p><p>&#x201C;Are we done here? I don&#x2019;t want to waste any more time.&#x201D;</p><p>I hurried Necro as I walked towards the door.</p><p>&#x201C;Let&#x2019;s go. For an adventure.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;...Adventure?&#x201D;</p><p>The kids spoke of &#x2018;hero&#x2019; and were focused very much on levelling up. Plus, this was a different world. Of course, this meant I would reach this conclusion.</p><p>&#x201C;I already know why you brought me here.&#x201D;</p><p>I could tell.</p><p>&#x201C;We&#x2019;re about to catch the Demon King, right?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Mn? No?&#x201D;</p><p>...Eh?</p><p>&#x201C;We already killed the Demon King?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;...Kidding?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;No joke.&#x201D;</p><p>Necro the final blow towards my confused self.</p><p>&#x201C;Ah~ you misunderstood, huh. Oh dear, there&#x2019;s no going around it then, huh. Fine. I&#x2019;ll tell you exactly why I summoned you here, O.K.?&#x201D;</p><p>Necro grinned.</p><p>&#x201C;Mr. Jin, you will, from this point on, come with me to kill the Hero. How about it? Feel your heart beating yet?&#x201D;</p><p>What&#x2026;?</p><p></p><hr><p></p>
