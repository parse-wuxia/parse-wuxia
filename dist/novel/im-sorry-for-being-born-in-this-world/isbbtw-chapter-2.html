<p><strong>Chapter 2. How to Level Up Quickly</strong></p><p>I was a little surprised, it was a lot like a hologram.</p><p>The contents of it are&#x2026; What managed to grab my attention was the red [Status] effects.</p><p>Dead, rot, paralysis, burn&#x2026;</p><p>I get why burn is there, but what&#x2019;s up with &#x201C;cursed&#x201D;?The existence of curses aside, though&#x2026; I was classified as a corpse. If one was able to think despite being dead, the person might as well be alive. If this was all there was to death, the idea of life being precious became a simple joke. Death made humans sad because they would never be able to talk to those who had departed.</p><p>I looked around a bit more to try and make sense of the situation, then felt a change around me.</p><p>The white space I was in was breaking down. Something flashed in front of me, and I became dizzy. I began to feel as if I was being dragged into the bottommost part of the sea. At some point when I was resisting, I realized that the feeling had disappeared.</p><p>What was going on?</p><p>I could feel a dull pressure from the back of my head, my back, my posterior, and my arms. Was I tranquilized? Was this because I was dead? I could hear the sound of metal being scratched through my ears. My nose&#x2026; I could smell blood and smoke through it. My tongue couldn&#x2019;t taste anything.</p><p>I tried to open my eyes, but my eyelids refused to move. When I exerted some force, I could hear something rip. One of my eyes barely managed to open.</p><p>I can&#x2019;t see&#x2026;</p><p>Everything I saw was white. It was almost as if a white veil had been placed over my eyes. I could only make out some shadows in front of me. And in this white world, a beautiful light that resembled the aurora of the North shined.</p><p>This is&#x2026;</p><p>The amount of things happening around me made me confused. My body wasn&#x2019;t doing so well either. I suppose this feeling could be described as having wet blankets wrapped around my limbs. The feeling of having clay stuck on your bones might be a fitting description as well.</p><p>Now, what shall I do?</p><p>If I was currently lying down in a hospital, it would be good for me to wait for the nurse. After all, things could only get worse the more I tried to move. I had already come to the police to be killed. There was no point in trying to run.</p><p>Right, I suppose I&#x2019;ll wait until someone comes.</p><p>After all, the current situation was quite interesting to me. Five minutes after I made my decision, I could hear several kids in the distance. They seemed to be around thirteen to eighteen, middle or high schoolers. They seemed to be from Korea, like me.</p><p>&#x201C;My level&#x2019;s not going up.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;That&#x2019;s because you keep hitting them when they&#x2019;re about to die. Haven&#x2019;t you heard what they were talking about in the orientation?&#x201D;</p><p>Were they talking about a game?</p><p>&#x201C;You think I&#x2019;m doing this on purpose? It&#x2019;s all instinct, I&#x2019;m telling you, instinct.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;This is why thieves are...&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Watch your damn mouth!&#x201D;</p><p>Three boys, and two girls. Their footsteps came to a stop near me.</p><p>&#x201C;Hey, what the hell is that? Someone threw away a beggar in our base.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Who did this?&#x201D;</p><p>The kids approached me slowly. I couldn&#x2019;t see them clearly, but I could still identify them through the shadows in my eyes.</p><p>What are these kids? Were they cosplaying?</p><p>They were all wearing school clothes, but each one of them had weapons. A sword, a knife, a staff, a bow, and a cross&#x2026; If this was an RPG game, they would be a warrior, a thief, a wizard, an archer, and a priest. The classic setup of a party.</p><p>The kids circled me as they talked amongst themselves.</p><p>&#x201C;Ew, gross. Did someone put his face through a microwave or something?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;It&#x2019;s completely melted.&#x201D;</p><p>The girls stepped away in disgust.</p><p>&#x201C;Hey, old man, stand up.&#x201D;</p><p>The warrior kid began to slap my cheek.</p><p>&#x201C;Stand up! God damn it! How long are you planning on sleeping here for? You think this is your home or something?&#x201D;</p><p>It doesn&#x2019;t hurt, but I suppose there&#x2019;s no need in pretending to sleep. There&#x2019;s a lot I want to ask too. Let&#x2019;s stand up, shall we? Hup, oh, ouch.</p><p>Flop!</p><p>I fell back down on the floor.</p><p>&#x201C;Ohh, so now you&#x2019;re putting on a show, huh?&#x201D;</p><p>I couldn&#x2019;t put any strength into my arm. I couldn&#x2019;t feel anything, which made it even harder to stand up. After a few tries, I managed to stand up. I looked down on the kids calmly.</p><p>The warrior kid flinched, then broke out in laughter.</p><p>&#x201C;Hey! Have you guys seen his title?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Title?&#x201D;</p><p>Ridiculing laughter came from all the children at the same time.</p><p>&#x201C;[Humanity&#x2019;s Worst Killer]? Is he a middle schooler or what? Pft.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Can you get a title from something you named yourself as?&#x201D;</p><p>The kids all grinned as the girl with the bow laughed at me.</p><p>Hm? Worst Killer? Title?</p><p>I had a good guess in what these words meant. It was probably the status screen from that white place. If these kids could see it&#x2026;I should be able to as well. The way to do it would be&#x2026;</p><p>A transparent window appeared in front of the kids.</p><p>I could navigate through the windows naturally, as if I had done so for a long time.</p><p>They were all level two. As I thought, they were high schoolers, and their titles were Smelter, Steal More, Grand Cheat, Ultimate Quiver, and Restore. They were the same name as their &#x201C;powers&#x201D;.</p><p>Why is that?</p><p>What is &#x201C;personality&#x201D;, and what is &#x201C;power&#x201D; supposed to be...? Of course, I wasn&#x2019;t asking for the actual definition of the words.</p><p>&#x201C;...&#x201D;</p><p>I tried opening my mouth, but no sound came out. Obviously, this was because my lungs weren&#x2019;t moving at all. Would they understand sign language?</p><p>&#x201C;I think he&#x2019;s mute...&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Yeah. What&#x2019;s he trying to say?&#x201D;</p><p>As I thought, no luck. If only I had a pen&#x2026; There were no writing utensils around though.</p><p>&#x201C;Eh? Hey, this guy&#x2019;s dead? Look at his status.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Huh? You&#x2019;re right? Is he a monster then?&#x201D;</p><p>Ultimate Quiver aimed his bow at me the moment he heard the word &#x201C;monster&#x201D;. He seemed to be ready to let go at any second. He doesn&#x2019;t have a quiver of any sort&#x2026; where did the arrow come from? Magic? Special effects?</p><p>&#x201C;He&#x2019;d have attacked already if he was a beast. Seeing how he&#x2019;s classified as a corpse, maybe that guy who uses necromancy revived him?&#x201D;</p><p>Necromancy. A form of black magic that controlled corpses. It was an ability that often appeared in video games.</p><p>The girl lowered her bow after hearing Grand Cheat&#x2019;s explanation. The arrow on the bow turned into grains of light and disappeared.</p><p>&#x201C;Disappointing. I&#x2019;d have killed him if he was a monster.&#x201D;</p><p>Smelter grinned after hearing Steal More&#x2019;s words.</p><p>&#x201C;Who said you couldn&#x2019;t?&#x201D;</p><p>The Smelter pulled out his sword.</p><p>&#x201C;So you&#x2019;re supposed to be the Worst Killer or something? Let&#x2019;s try fighting, shall we? I want to check out how strong I am.&#x201D;</p><p>I shook my head.I understood that I was in a different world and that it was possible to see status screens like in video games. I also understood that everyone had special abilities on their hands.</p><p>I probably had one as well.</p><p>Then, what was important here would be to collect information. There was no need to start fighting immediately without knowing the other side&#x2019;s ability. If there really were special abilities, the first logical thing to do would be to learn how to break it. I was slowly beginning to gain some interest in this world.</p><p>&#x201C;What, are you scared?&#x201D;</p><p>The Smelter translated my rejection differently. Anyone from the underground world would&#x2019;ve ran away on their own after seeing my title&#x2026;</p><p>&#x201C;You&#x2019;re a grown adult. Aren&#x2019;t you embarrassed? Or maybe it&#x2019;s too much for someone like you to fight little children?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;You know he&#x2019;s the strongest fighter in his city?&#x201D;</p><p>...I couldn&#x2019;t even laugh. I just nodded after looking at Restore&#x2019;s actions. I then headed towards the exit. I had learned how to see through this white veil at this point, so I could tell generally what was around me.</p><p>&#x201C;Wow, he&#x2019;s ignoring me. Where do you think you&#x2019;re going?&#x201D;</p><p>Smelter blocked my path with a sword in his hand. The rest of the group surrounded me with their weapons in their hands as well.</p><p>What era was this supposed to be? Kids who haven&#x2019;t even graduated from high school were pointing weapons towards someone&#x2026; I pushed the sword away and walked forward. Smelter&#x2019;s body got pushed away with it, due to our differences in size.</p><p>&#x201C;Hah...&#x201D;</p><p>An annoyed laugh came out of Smelter&#x2019;s mouth. They should attack about now.</p><p>The sword in Smelter&#x2019;s hands began to arc towards my neck. I had expected the attack beforehand, so I dodged it easily, and turned to look at Smelter. I couldn&#x2019;t see his face, but judging from the trembling shoulders, I could tell that he was quite mad. When I was shooing him away with my hand, he shouted out in rage.</p><p>&#x201C;Minsung!&#x201D;</p><p>Steal More extended his hands towards me with his body lowered.</p><p>Why wasn&#x2019;t he using his knife...?</p><p>I dodged to the left. As I did this, Steal More&#x2019;s body, which had been coming towards me from the right, disappeared, only to appear to my left. Grand Cheat showed a satisfied grin. What just&#x2026;?</p><p>&#x201C;Caught you!&#x201D;</p><p>When Steal More&#x2019;s hand touched my left leg, I fell down powerlessly. Paralysis? I couldn&#x2019;t put any strength into my lefts.</p><p>&#x201C;You can&#x2019;t move, can you?&#x201D;</p><p>Was this one of their special abilities?</p><p>&#x201C;This is my power! [Endless Greed = Steal More]. I can steal anything aside from a person&#x2019;s power! Money, weapon, body, looks, and even strength!&#x201D;</p><p>What an idiot. Why was he going so far as to explain his abilities to me? With this, though, I learned that special abilities were referred to as &#x201C;power&#x201D; in this world, and also learned that my strength was what just got stolen from me. This meant that my special ability was [Gold Achieves All = Heart of Gold]. Was it an ability that allowed me to control gold? Or did the use of my ability require gold? I had no idea how to use it&#x2026;</p><p>&#x201C;Good job!&#x201D;</p><p>Smelter put his hand towards a statue on one side of the wall. The statue melted and out came a long chain.A Kusari-Fundo (&#x9396;&#x5206;&#x9285;). It was a chain that had weights added to it on each end.</p><p>So that was how they made their weapons? That must be why their weapons were so poorly made&#x2026; I wasn&#x2019;t planning on killing them before, but change of plans. Killing this kid is worth taking the risk. As I watched Smelter swing his weapon, I caught an arrow that was shot towards me from behind.</p><p>&#x201C;No way...&#x201D;</p><p>Ultimate Quiver covered her mouth in surprise.</p><p>I was planning on throwing it back at her after I grabbed it, but the arrow had turned to light particles before I could do so. So there wasn&#x2019;t any other advantages to these arrows other than being able to use it infinitely? Or maybe the ability hasn&#x2019;t been fully matured yet.</p><p>Now, there was two people left&#x2014; Grand Cheat and Restore. Grand Cheat probably tricks you in some way and Restore should just restore injuries.</p><p>The kusari-fundo flew towards my chest. It was such an obvious attack, which I almost instinctively dodged left, but remembered what had happened with Steal More. I lifted my arms to protect my chest and head.</p><p>Crack!</p><p>My left arm was hit and my balance was shaken as a result. The attack was coming straight towards my chest, but again it came from the side. This was probably the result of &#x300E;The Great Trick = Grand Cheat&#x300F;. It probably had the effect of &#x2018;changing A to B&#x2019;.</p><p>&#x201C;Are you a mannequin or something? At least resist. Try shaking your hand like before?&#x201D;</p><p>The Smelter smiled as if he had already won.</p><p>&#x201C;Hey guys, try cheering for him or something? Who knows, maybe he&#x2019;ll get an erection from it?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Should we?&#x201D;</p><p>Restore smiled, and began to clap.</p><p>&#x201C;Fight hard, you piece of shit!&#x201D;</p><p></p><hr><p></p>
