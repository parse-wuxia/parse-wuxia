<p>Chapter 52. Rewriting Fate - Round 4 (2)</p><p>&#x201C;Ten seconds?&#x201D;</p><p>The saint quickly got to work when I began the countdown. She happily muttered &#x201C;what do I choose&#x2026;?&#x201D; under her breath. The shoe that she chose in the end was a pair of high heels that didn&#x2019;t match her dress at all. The heels were high enough to raise her height by about seven centimeters. Was she she trying to look as tall as possible&#x2026;? I didn&#x2019;t know she longed for fresh air that much.</p><p>Even so, it looks like she might fall over with a pair of heels that high.</p><p>I looked around a bit and chose a smaller pair of shoes for her. They were a pair of a flat shiny white shoes that seemed to really match her white fleece skirt.</p><p>&#x201C;Isn&#x2019;t this better? I&#x2019;m not sure you can even walk in those.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Hah? What you just said was a very big insult to my womanhood!&#x201D;</p><p>Womanhood...? Does she want to grow that much? The saint became enraged and grabbed her high heels.</p><p>&#x201C;I can take a high heel you know? Even a keel heel is nothing to me! I can take keel heels and even area heals with ease!&#x201D;</p><p>Again with the wordplay. The saint laughed at me with the keel heel on and I just shook my head in response. Was she supposed to be a clown or what? She chose the high heels against everyone&#x2019;s will and took off her shoes.</p><p>Ah, was she&#x2026;</p><p>The saint put her hands in her skirt as everyone watched and took off her tights. The black cloth rolled away to reveal a white leg. She stood up like a crane on one leg and attempted to take off the other one from her other leg. Wasn&#x2019;t she embarrassed&#x2026;?</p><p>As I watched her in stupefaction, the saint laughed quietly to herself and stomped over to me.</p><p>&#x201C;To think you&#x2019;d look at me with those eyes&#x2026; As I thought, high school girls really are premium products. Right, I&#x2019;ll give this to you as a reward. Please treat it preciously. Ah! Maybe you can use this as your family heirloom.&#x201D;</p><p>She was trying to give me her stocking. It even smelled because of the summer heat.</p><p>&#x201C;I don&#x2019;t want it!&#x201D;</p><p>I threw it down on the ground as soon as I got it.</p><p>*</p><p>&#x201C;Nom!&#x201D;</p><p>The saint took a giant bite out of her pancake and had a smile on her face while putting her hands around her cheeks. A pancake topped with corn salad, a corn dog, along with ketchup and mustard. It was just $2.5 dollars. She downed it in two bites and began to search for her next target. The whole time she was doing this, she kept glancing at me with a guilty face.</p><p>&#x201C;Cah I hah oh moh pleh?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Swallow first. Don&#x2019;t speak with your mouth full.&#x201D;</p><p>She eats a lot. Why does it feel like I&#x2019;m raising a cow? The two of us went up to the seventh floor and I began to feed the saint out of curiosity just to see how much she could eat. The eighth floor is a cinema complex, so&#x2026; I guess we&#x2019;re going to watch a movie next?</p><p>Feels kind of boring.</p><p>I shoved bacon sticks and fries into her mouth as I thought about the movie we were going to watch.</p><p>Nom nom.</p><p>She really eats like a whale. Kinda like pacman. She probably would&#x2019;ve eaten my hand if I wasn&#x2019;t paying attention. The saint noticed that I was observing her curiously as I shoved more food into her and handed me a stick of roast meat.</p><p>&#x201C;Heh~ So you&#x2019;re finally feeling hungry, Mr. Murderer? You should eat. Ahh~&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Don&#x2019;t have to. I don&#x2019;t feel hungry and I can&#x2019;t taste anything anyways.&#x201D;</p><p>She kept trying to push it in despite me closing my mouth tightly. My face became covered with sauce thanks to that.</p><p>&#x201C;You&#x2019;ll be able to taste a little if I put a shining buster through your mouth.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Words can be violence too damn it!&#x201D;</p><p>She really did whatever she wanted. I ended up taking the stick and activated Heart of Gold. I bought the Devourer Ring from the special equipment section. It would look like a couple&#x2019;s ring if I put it on my ring finger, so I&#x2019;ll put it on my middle finger.</p><p>Well, we still look like a couple like this.</p><p>We just look like one of course.</p><p>I had zero feelings for the saint. I, who had no &#x2018;heart&#x2019; to begin with, would probably never end up loving someone. For now, I was planning on satisfying her, so that&#x2026; She wouldn&#x2019;t get in my way&#x2014; so that I could focus.</p><p>Her memory would reset by the end of the day.</p><p>In the end, all this was just being done to satisfy myself. To the saint, all this was completely meaningless.</p><p>Hm, in any case&#x2026;</p><p>&#x201C;Annoying.&#x201D;</p><p>I quietly looked at the people around us. No matter where we went, people followed. They weren&#x2019;t just following us either. They were taking pictures with their smartphones without trying to hide it. Did they really have that little to do? The saint slipped when she didn&#x2019;t pay attention falling down on the ground with a gasp. We were surrounded with the clamor of shutter sounds again.</p><p>As I thought, she wasn&#x2019;t used to the high heels. Why did she pick it then? The reason why people decorated themselves was to look good to a person. The conclusion I reached therefore, was obvious.</p><p>To look good in front of me.</p><p>No, that delusion is just too big. It shouldn&#x2019;t have hurt that much, but she was crying like a baby as she extended her arms at me. I remember something like this happening before. Back when we were setting the barrier to trap the Warrior.</p><p>I told her to get up on her own at the time, but&#x2026;</p><p>I grabbed her arms and helped her up. My hands caught fire when I grabbed hers and I was filled with pain. At the same time, I could feel her warmth along with the soft feeling of her hand.</p><p>&#x201C;What the, look! Look!&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Fire...&#x201D;</p><p>The audience muttered amongst themselves when they saw the holy flame. Well, it&#x2019;s not like it matters if they see it. I could just call it a magic trick.</p><p>&#x201C;...Than&#x2026; You.&#x201D;</p><p>She said thanks with an almost silent voice. She had turned beet red from embarrassment as she dusted off her clothes. Whatever happened to her crying earlier? Anyway, I suppose I should give her a new pair of shoes&#x2026; I snapped my fingers and asked the guard to take out the white flats. When I pushed the pair onto her, she ended up putting her feet towards me after a bit of initial resistance. Was she trying to be cinderella or something?</p><p>&#x201C;You wear it.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;You weren&#x2019;t going to put it on?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Why should I?&#x201D;</p><p>The saint&#x2019;s face turned even redder than before when I refused her outright. Well, it was obvious where this was all going. I refused her despite knowing that. After all, even it was me, putting on shoes for a woman was&#x2026; a little awkward.</p><p></p><hr><p></p>
