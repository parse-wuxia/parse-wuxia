<p><strong>Chapter 9. Heart of Gold</strong></p><p>&#x201C;Idiot saint.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Stupid murderer.&#x201D;</p><p>The conversation got nowhere, and I only got more annoyed. It wasn&#x2019;t like I could just keep glaring at her, though. Let&#x2019;s try to change the topic.</p><p>&#x201C;Fine, I&#x2019;ll apologize first. Let me just ask you something...&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;What is it?&#x201D;</p><p>She had a sour look on her face.</p><p>&#x201C;Oh~ so even a genius like you has things you don&#x2019;t know? As an idiot, I don&#x2019;t really know if I can answer you properly?&#x201D;</p><p>A high school girl who was unfazed by a murderer in front of her. Well, it was obvious that she wouldn&#x2019;t be afraid, really. After all, she beat me once already, and her HP pretty much forbid her from dying.</p><p>&#x201C;At least you can tell me where we are?&#x201D;</p><p>The saint pouted, and spoke in a sulky voice.</p><p>&#x201C;It&#x2019;s an underground containment room.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Containment room?&#x201D;</p><p>The saint pointed at me and shouted, as if she had been waiting for me to say that.</p><p>&#x201C;After all, you need to learn just what your power is! Of course, you have no choice in this matter!&#x201D;</p><p>I&#x2019;ve heard this several times already.</p><p>&#x201C;Are powers really that dangerous?&#x201D;</p><p>The saint put her finger on her chin, and made a thinking pose.</p><p>&#x201C;Mm~ I wonder? I almost got eaten once, and my neck got snapped that one other time, so against &#x2018;you people&#x2019;, it&#x2019;s pretty dangerous, I&#x2019;d say.&#x201D;</p><p>...You people?</p><p>&#x201C;But rather than dangerous&#x2026; I think the adjective &#x2018;useful&#x2019; is more fitting. Just look at my love &amp; peace! This room is only there for the exceptions!&#x201D;</p><p>She made a disgusted face as she pointed at me again.</p><p>&#x201C;You seem dangerous, so make sure you get locked up in a prison like this if you ever commit a crime. Ah, you said your power was called &#x2018;Heart of Gold&#x2019;, right? Seems quite terrifying.&#x201D;</p><p>The saint let out an exaggerated gasp, and made a fearful face.</p><p>&#x201C;Could it be&#x2026; an ability to make people turn into gold just by looking at them?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Who knows. We&#x2019;ll know when I use it.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Don&#x2019;t you look down on my guesses! I always get one out of ten powers right, you know?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;So you get nine wrong out of every ten guesses...&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Eh, it&#x2019;s good enough. Now, I&#x2019;ll teach you how to use your power, so just you wait!&#x201D;</p><p>The saint leapt over the sofa behind her, and ran away from me. She stopped in front of the steel door. She seemed to think that wasn&#x2019;t enough, and used her mana to create a shield around her.</p><p>&#x201C;The way to use your power is simple! Just think of the name of your power for three seconds!&#x201D;</p><p>It&#x2019;s that simple?</p><p>&#x201C;There&#x2019;s no ceremony or anything like that&#x2026;?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Nope!&#x201D;</p><p>Was she for real? I didn&#x2019;t fully trust her, but still followed her instructions.</p><p>[Gold Achieves All = Heart of Gold].</p><p>Ding.</p><p>A window that was about 32 inches big appeared in front of me. I thought it was a function of the skill Oracle for a second, but once I saw that &#x201C;Heart of Gold&#x201D; was written at the top with a list below it, I was rendered speechless. This&#x2026; is my power&#x2026;?</p><p>&#x201C;Did you succeed?&#x201D;</p><p>The saint asked me this from afar. I thought about lying for a second, but gave up on it immediately.</p><p>&#x201C;Well&#x2026; I don&#x2019;t know if this really counts as success, really...&#x201D;</p><p>The saint found my answer to be quite peculiar, and walked towards me. She sat down right next to me, and looked into the window with a guarded look.</p><p>&#x201C;This is&#x2026; internet shopping?&#x201D;</p><p>After thinking a little bit, the saint took out party poppers from somewhere, and popped them in front of me.</p><p>&#x201C;Congrats! Yay!&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Thanks.&#x201D;</p><p>I pinched the saint&#x2019;s cheeks with a smile.</p><p>&#x201C;U, uugh, please shtahp..!&#x201D;</p><p>My fingers caught fire. My body, which was only moving due to the effects of black magic, was capable of being purified just by touching the saint.</p><p>&#x201C;Dangerous? Terrifying? 10% chance of getting abilities right?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;It&#x2019;s not my fault! It&#x2019;s not my fault! Eii!&#x201D;</p><p>A little later. I looked carefully at the saint sitting on the other side of me. She took a sip of her tea, and smiled brightly.</p><p>&#x201C;Don&#x2019;t be so disappointed. Perhaps it was a disguise to hide your true power? It&#x2019;s only possible to get a clear idea of what your ability is after reading its description anyway. The analysis must&#x2019;ve been completed about now, so I suppose we can check it together?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Analysis?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Powers, skills, and items that have been recorded by the Oracle are analyzed by the skill for its users. New abilities take about five minutes to analyze, though.&#x201D;</p><p>When I thought of the word &#x201C;click&#x201D;, a mouse pointer of sorts appeared. Right, so this is how this works?</p><p>Click.</p><p>[Gold Achieves All = Heart of Gold]</p><p>- An ability to buy anything with money.</p><p>- [Lv.1] Trade (Buy, sell)</p><p>There wasn&#x2019;t enough information.</p><p>&#x201C;I clicked it.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Hold on.&#x201D;</p><p>The saint pressed something with her finger in the air.</p><p><span style="">&lt;Morto Hai has asked to party with you. Will you accept? Y/N&gt;</span></p><p>Was it possible to share information with those you partied with? YES.</p><p>The saint&#x2019;s eyes moved quickly, as if she was reading something.</p><p>&#x201C;It seems to be a manifestation of money worship of sorts, but&#x2026; Hm, [Whitehead] and [Menticide]...&#x201D;</p><p>It seemed that she was reading some other things as well. I, too, was looking into the saint&#x2019;s abilities.</p><p>[Complete remembrance = Total Recall]</p><p>- Perfect memory.</p><p>The descriptions were completely useless. Was it like photographic memory? I imagine this would come at a cost as well.</p><p>&#x201C;I&#x2019;ve confirmed it! Your ability seems to be a shopping ability!&#x201D;</p><p>That&#x2019;s it? After all that time of thinking?</p><p>&#x201C;Oh, I see&#x2026; is that what you thought I&#x2019;d saaaayyy!&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Puha!&#x201D;</p><p>When I reached out to grab her cheeks again, the saint sprayed out the tea in her mouth out of surprise.</p><p>&#x201C;Gah!&#x201D;</p><p>Hiss!</p><p>My hands and face caught on blue fire, and pain ran across it.</p><p><span style="">&lt;Jin has gotten a status effect.&gt;</span></p><p>&#x201C;My eyes&#x2026; my eyeesss..!&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Ahh! Uhh&#x2026; what do I do?!&#x201D;</p><p>To think the tea in her mouth would turn into holy water&#x2026; After rolling on the floor in pain for a while, I stood up as if nothing had happened once the fire dissipated.</p><p>&#x201C;Er...&#x201D;</p><p>The saint carefully opened her mouth as she handed me a handkerchief.</p><p>&#x201C;This...&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;I don&#x2019;t need it.&#x201D;</p><p>The saint hugged her chest with a shocked face.</p><p>&#x201C;Could it be&#x2026; you think it&#x2019;s too precious&#x2026;?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Precious? What&#x2019;s precious?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Holy water that sprayed out of a young female student?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Shut the hell up.&#x201D;</p><p>It seems that I am sort of a laughing stock for her.</p><p>&#x201C;So? Results?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;I don&#x2019;t know how to put it, but...&#x201D;</p><p>The saint looked away as she said this.</p><p>&#x201C;Now that you&#x2019;ve found out that your ability isn&#x2019;t combat oriented, why not give up?&#x201D;</p><p>This kid&#x2026; She was clearly holding back her laughter. Her shoulders were shaking as she said this.</p><p>&#x201C;It&#x2019;s just at level one? I think it&#x2019;d get better over time. Plus, it&#x2019;s an alright power. If I were to look at it with a positive light...&#x201D;</p><p>The saint&#x2019;s hand that was currently over her mouth trembled. Her face was beet red. Well, it was understandable. Humanity&#x2019;s worst murderer, menticide, the heartless monster&#x2026; has attained an internet shopping ability, after all.</p><p>&#x201C;I think it&#x2019;s pretty good.&#x201D;</p><p>And I wasn&#x2019;t lying. It had almost an infinite number of uses, and it allows the user to lower the risk for his ventures as much as he wanted. I just haven&#x2019;t leveled it up properly yet.</p><p>&#x201C;Even so, it&#x2019;s just a shopping ability&#x2026; Pft! Ahaha!&#x201D;</p><p>In the end, the saint let loose. And my patience ran out as well.</p><p>&#x201C;Gyaah!&#x201D;</p><p>Doesn&#x2019;t matter if my hands burn or not. I grabbed onto her cheek again. I can&#x2019;t take it unless I begin stretching that mochi-like cheek of hers.</p><p>&#x201C;Kya!&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Don&#x2019;t laugh at other people&#x2019;s abilities!&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;It hurs! It hurrrts! Ora! Shiniing-!&#x201D;</p><p>That again?!</p><p>A little later. I, who cleaned up the general mess in the room, looked into the eyes of the saint. The lecture began.</p><p>&#x201C;I&#x2019;ve said this multiple times already, Mr. Murderer. You touch the skins of little girls too easily.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;I&#x2019;m sorry...&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;You need to be more mature. I almost invoked the power of a cop within me, you know?&#x201D;</p><p>I, whose body was completely messed up due to the shining buster, bowed deeply.</p><p>&#x201C;I have nothing to say...&#x201D;</p><p>This is quite unfair, but let&#x2019;s stay still for now.</p><p>&#x201C;I think that, with this ability, it&#x2019;ll be&#x2026; quite hard to deal with the hero and his companions. Anyway, let&#x2019;s start again, shall we? Appearance isn&#x2019;t everything, after all.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Then...&#x201D;</p><p>[Heart of Gold]. A shopping window appeared in front of me.</p><p>&#x201C;Buy something, would you?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Alright.&#x201D;</p><p>I found an e-cigarette using the search bar, and put it in my cart. It cost $250. Alright. Checkout.</p><p><span style="">&lt;Unable to checkout.&gt;</span></p><p>&#x201C;I can&#x2019;t buy anything?&#x201D;</p><p>I stretched out my hand. The saint looked down at it curiously.</p><p>&#x201C;What is this?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;I need cash.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;To think you&#x2019;d ask for money like a pimp&#x2026; fine, I&#x2019;ll lend you some, so just take it. 10% interest per day.&#x201D;</p><p>High interest, huh. The saint took out a gold coin out of a wallet shaped like a frog.</p><p>&#x201C;Thank you for your donation.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;I&#x2019;m lending you!&#x201D;</p><p>I ignored it. Anyway, what should I&#x2026; I tried putting the gold coin on the shopping window.</p><p>Ka-ching!</p><p>The gold coin disappeared, and I had acquired $1500.</p><p>&#x201C;......&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Power&#x201D; was something that was akin to a manifestation of all the experiences of my life. Then this must mean that my &#x2018;true self&#x2019; spent quite a time working on this sound effect&#x2026; Was he that bored? When I pressed the checkout button again, I was told to type out an address.</p><p>&#x201C;Address.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;I don&#x2019;t know.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;You&#x2019;re no help.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Kuh&#x2026;!&#x201D;</p><p>I put in &#x201C;in front of customer&#x201D; instead of the actual address. It should come, right? ...Right? It was hard for me to look into the eyes of the saint. Time to press the confirm button.</p><p><span style="">&lt;Transaction has been completed. The delivery should take eight hours.&gt;</span></p><p>Mm&#x2026;</p><p>&#x201C;Apparently it takes eight hours.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Eight hours? How useless!&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;......&#x201D;</p><p>The saint put away her teacups, and stood up.</p><p>&#x201C;We&#x2019;ll end it here. We can meet tomorrow at the same time. Useless Mr. Murderer.&#x201D;</p><p>Looking at her tired face, it seemed that she was about to go to sleep.</p><p>&#x201C;Ah, just a second. Would you please bring a dictionary tomorrow?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;What? A dictionary?&#x201D;</p><p>There is no better way to learn about a world than through a dictionary. After all, a dictionary contains all the words in the world. I could buy it using my power, but that&#x2019;d be a waste of money.</p><p>&#x201C;A dictionary of this world. The biggest one, if possible. Ah, I also need a map and a history book.&#x201D;</p><p>The saint had a question mark above her head. No, it&#x2019;s not a metaphor. There was an actual question mark above her head. Probably done through the use of the Oracle.</p><p>&#x201C;What are you going to use it for?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Studying.&#x201D;</p><p>Just identifying the existence of these things is enough. I need to learn, research, and study in order to win. After all, this aspect of life should be a concurrent in all worlds.</p><p>&#x201C;...Hm. Alright. Anything else? No? Ok! I&#x2019;ll be going, then?&#x201D;</p><p>After talking to herself shortly, the saint yawned, and disappeared while waving her arms.</p><p></p><hr><p></p>
