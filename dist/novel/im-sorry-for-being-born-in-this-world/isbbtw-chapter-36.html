<p><strong>Chapter 36. The Night of The Broken</strong></p><p>The night of the Warrior&#x2019;s death was almost horrifyingly silent. The mission was a success, which called for a celebration, but I suppose that couldn&#x2019;t really be a thing with the amount of blood it took to achieve this. I stayed in the stables as usual, with a book in hand, until the saint came over to meet me with a body drenched in sweat.</p><p>&quot;Mr. Murderer? So you were here after all.&quot;</p><p>Something was off. But I really didn&#x2019;t care enough to find out more about it. Since I was born I had never taken interest in a person other than myself. Due to this, I wasn&#x2019;t very happy about the saint&#x2019;s surprise visit.</p><p>&quot;The way to find the right answer?&quot;</p><p>I answered her lazily as I kept reading.</p><p>&quot;Who knows. It&#x2019;d be different based on the problem at hand, wouldn&#x2019;t you think? The easiest method would be something close to the sieve of Eratosthenes. It&#x2019;s the easiest method of finding prime numbers. It&#x2019;s quite simple. You just net out the numbers that aren&#x2019;t prime numbers. You&#x2019;ll be left with the right answers by the end. Process of elimination works quite well.&quot;</p><p>Because I could not kill, I loosened the definition of death. I tried putting the societal death as a form of death. The only reason why this plan succeeded was luck.</p><p>As a person who chose to die, I didn&#x2019;t have any particular desire to live. This &quot;hero hunt&quot; was only a form of entertainment for me. The saint stayed silent even when I was thinking all this.</p><p>This is why conversations were boring. The responses of others were extremely slow compared to my thought process. It almost felt like I was living in a world of water. I saw the saint open her mouth and realized that she was about to ask another question.</p><p>&quot;If the Warrior didn&#x2019;t choose death&#x2026; What were you planning to do? Were you actually going to erupt the volcano&#x2026;?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Who knows? I couldn&#x2019;t even make the volcano erupt using the method I told him. I can&#x2019;t deliver things underneath the volcano.&quot;</p><p>If there was no empty space underground, the delivery wouldn&#x2019;t go through. Well, it&#x2019;s not like there was no way to make the volcano erupt, but still.</p><p>&quot;Then&#x2026; Would you have given up&#x2026;?&quot;</p><p>&quot;No. The reason why magma explodes is because there&#x2019;s pressure building up from the inside. It doesn&#x2019;t even have to be pressure from under the magma. I just need to apply sudden pressure to the magma. If I wanted the volcano to explode, I wouldn&#x2019;t have even ordered water.&quot;</p><p>The level one ability of Heart of Gold already had infinite possibilities. I could sink a ship by ordering a huge amount of goods on it, or I could destroy a building in a similar manner. I continued talking.</p><p>&quot;This is all just a theory in the end. The volcano might not have even erupted back then, causing my plans to be jeopardized. But I just need to change the equation a little bit or use a different method when something like that happens. In fact, I don&#x2019;t even need to cause the volcano to erupt.&quot;</p><p>&quot;&#x2026;There was no need?&quot;</p><p>I confessed everything to the frowning saint.</p><p>&quot;I could&#x2019;ve exploded a sector in the town with a bomb, then threatened the Warrior with the villagers. The result of this would&#x2019;ve been the same. I just used the volcano for artistic value.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Just for that&#x2026;&quot;</p><p>Because I could, I did. That was all.</p><p>&quot;&apos;Taking hostages&apos;. There really are no better ways to kill heroes, don&#x2019;t you think? People like the Warrior never hesitate to give their lives for other people. I don&#x2019;t understand it myself, but I assume there&#x2019;s some kind of logic involved with their line of thought. Well, but then again, they might not be thinking logically at all.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I see&#x2026;&quot;</p><p>The saint listened to me quietly, then declared something with a loud voice.</p><p>&quot;I forbid you from taking hostages from now on.&quot;</p><p>&quot;&#x2026;Why?&quot;</p><p>It wasn&#x2019;t like I&#x2019;d have any problems with that, but it didn&#x2019;t make sense. Even when I understood the thought process of the saint, I thought it was quite strange. The saint spoke to me with a desperate tone.</p><p>&quot;It&#x2019;s not right to play around with a person&#x2019;s life. Please stop it.&quot;</p><p>&quot;You&#x2019;re such a hypocrite. Didn&#x2019;t you take part in killing Romeo? Don&#x2019;t try to ignore your own sins.&quot;</p><p>The saint responded to my reproach as such.</p><p>&quot;Who&#x2019;s Romeo?&quot;</p><p>She asked me this with blurred eyes, as if she had become a different person altogether.</p><p>&quot;&#x2026;You sure you&#x2019;ve slept enough?&quot;</p><p>&quot;I&#x2019;m completely fine. Slept enough.&quot;</p><p>How strange. Her eyes were sick for a person who had slept, and her forehead had drops of sweat streaming down it.</p><p>&quot;Romeo Smith. That was the Warrior&#x2019;s name. Remember?&quot;</p><p>&quot;I don&#x2019;t know anyone like that&#x2026;&quot;</p><p>A blank response void of any emotion. I realized something was terribly wrong, and began to relay more information to her.</p><p>&quot;The undying. Sword dancer. The Warrior. His name was Romeo Smith. An American. He was one of the members of the hero&#x2019;s party, and was also your former comrade. The person who loved you.&quot;</p><p>&quot;You&#x2019;re saying quite a lot of strange things.&quot;</p><p>The saint smiled like a sickly patient.</p><p>&quot;You&#x2019;re the one who needs more sleep, huh, Mr. Murderer? The Warrior&#x2019;s name isn&#x2019;t Romeo Smith, it&#x2019;s &#x25CB;&#x25CB;&#x25CB; &#x25CB;&#x25CB;&#x25CB;.&quot;</p><p>&#x2026;What the hell is that name? I heard it, but I couldn&#x2019;t even begin to try to pronounce it. It was almost as if the translator was returning broken text back to me. I realized the weight of the situation, and contacted Necro immediately. A bit later, the man ran towards us with a clatter.</p><p>&quot;Morto&#x2026;&quot;</p><p>Necro uttered the saint&#x2019;s name with a saddened voice as he came up next to her. I could see that he was desperately trying to hide his face that seemed to be on the verge of tears.</p><p>This wasn&#x2019;t like him.</p><p>The saint didn&#x2019;t seem to notice that though, and asked an innocent question to Necro.</p><p>&quot;What is it?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Eh? It&#x2019;s nothing, it&#x2019;s nothing&#x2026;&quot;</p><p>Necro spoke to her with a soft and caring voice, as if he was taking care of a small child.</p><p>&quot;You must be tired. You should get some sleep.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I&#x2019;m not that sleepy&#x2026; I&#x2019;ve already slept enough as a matter of fact.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Still, go sleep some more.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Alright, then&#x2026;&quot;</p><p>The saint turned to me and waved her arms.</p><p>&quot;Mr. Murderer, please have a good night. I&#x2019;ll see you tomorrow.&quot;</p><p>I watched her quietly, then eventually waved back with a kind smile.</p><p>*</p><p>At a table on the first floor of the inn. Necro explained to me that this condition of hers began about two years ago.</p><p>&quot;Autobiographical memory distortion, was it? The condition is pretty damn strong for her, though.&quot;</p><p>&quot;&#x2026;Is that so?&quot;</p><p>Memory isn&#x2019;t perfect. Humans were made to remember only the happy things in life, and occasionally reformat certain memories in life. Then what about Morto&#x2019;s ability?</p><p>[Total Recall].</p><p>It was abnormal to have perfect memory as a human. It wasn&#x2019;t natural. Even my brain, the Palace of Memory, wasn&#x2019;t able to recall everything that I see and hear perfectly. The saint&#x2019;s ability was closer to an error in this world.</p><p>That was because perfect memory would make someone be able to recall the worst of the worst memories in perfect condition. This was both a great advantage and a disadvantage&#x2014;. No, it was a flaw that couldn&#x2019;t be fixed.</p><p>&quot;Just think about it. You can&#x2019;t forget horrid memories that you desperately want to forget. A person like that has no choice but to go crazy. Even meds can&#x2019;t fix something like this. Don&#x2019;t worry too much about it, I guess? This won&#x2019;t affect our mission one bit.&quot;</p><p>That horrid memory that Necro was talking about couldn&#x2019;t be Romeo Smith&#x2019;s death. It was something darker than that. Something that was dark and unsightly enough to render the saint into this state. I didn&#x2019;t bother asking any more though. A failure of a product like me never had any interest in other people in the first place. Such things were worthless. I just hoped that Necro would get done with this talk as fast as possible. I half-listened to Necro&#x2019;s story, then interrupted him in the middle of his story.</p><p>&quot;I get it. So it&#x2019;s a form of memory distortion?&quot;</p><p>The saint loses her memory of a person when someone close to her dies. Because the death of those she didn&#x2019;t know didn&#x2019;t make her sad. Because the deaths of those on the other side of the world didn&#x2019;t matter to her.</p><p>That&#x2019;s good.</p><p>Because I&#x2019;m already dead, because I&#x2019;m a dead person, she&#x2019;d never forget about me.</p><p>Well&#x2026;</p><p>I suppose that doesn&#x2019;t matter, does it.</p><p></p><hr><p></p>
