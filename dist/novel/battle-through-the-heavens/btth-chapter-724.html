<p><strong><u>Chapter 724: Dealing With The Misty Cloud Sect</u></strong></p><p>The open ground immediately became quiet when Xiao Yan&#x2019;s crimson eyes swept down. Some of the Misty Cloud Sect&#x2019;s disciples quietly swallowed a mouthful of saliva. They felt an uneasiness in their hearts. Now that the mysterious great demon had fled, it was likely the time to come and look for the Misty Cloud Sect to settle their debt.</p><p>Hai Bodong and the others were startled when they saw Xiao Yan&#x2019;s expression. They immediately moved their bodies and appeared beside Xiao Yan and stared at the area below with ill intent.</p><p>Yun Yun&#x2019;s pretty face changed slightly when she saw the lineup in the sky. She pressed her delicate hand down and suppressed the commotion on the open ground. Currently, Yun Shan was already dead. Therefore, she had once again become the person in charge of all matters within the Misty Cloud Sect. It was due to this that she could not just watch the Misty Cloud Sect be destroyed by Xiao Yan&#x2019;s hand.</p><p>&#x201C;You&#x2026; what exactly do you want to do? It&#x2019;s already at a time like this. Why don&#x2019;t you just speak forthright? What exactly do you want to do?&#x201D;</p><p>Yun Yun clenched her silver teeth. Her drifting eyes finally paused on Xiao Yan&#x2019;s unusually chilly face. Her emotions were extremely chaotic at this moment. Although her relationship with Yun Shan had become much paler over these few years, the latter was ultimately her teacher. Now that Yun Shan had died by Xiao Yan&#x2019;s hand, she ought to be helping him take revenge. However, given the various acts of Yun Shan during these few years, he could only blame himself for having come to such an end. This point was something that even Yun Yun could not refute.</p><p>Yun Shan died by Xiao Yan&#x2019;s hands. Reasonably speaking, he deserved to die. However, on the emotional side, Yun Yun held the responsibility to help take revenge for him as a disciple of the Misty Cloud Sect. However, forget about the issue about the Misty Cloud Sect being at a great disadvantage. Even if Yun Yun had the ability, it was extremely difficult for her to kill Xiao Yan and take revenge. Hence, Yun Yun&#x2019;s struggle was quite intense amid this hesitation.</p><p>Xiao Yan&#x2019;s face twitched upon hearing Yun Yun&#x2019;s voice. However, he lifted his head and laughed to the sky. The laughter was filled with a misery and fury, &#x201C;What do I want? The Misty Cloud Sect abducted my father then destroyed my Xiao clan. Now, it has even caused my teacher to be captured by the &#x2018;Hall of Souls&#x2019; with his fate unknown. You are still asking me what I want to do?&#x201D;</p><p>Yun Yun held her delicate hands tightly as she sensed the misery and fury within Xiao Yan&#x2019;s words. Her fingernails pierced her palm until it was painful. She was able to know the kind of fury and pain in the former&#x2019;s heart. She too had no excuse to give for the actions that the Misty Cloud Sect had done these few years.</p><p>&#x201C;The actions that teacher committed these couple of years indeed harmed you greatly. However, you have already turned the Misty Cloud Sect into such a state. Can&#x2019;t you just stop?&#x201D; Yun Yun&#x2019;s full breasts rose gently as she lightly bit her lower red lip. She finally involuntarily spoke a moment later. That voice contained a begging tone to it.</p><p>&#x201C;Stop? You are asking me to stop at such a time? Do you think it is possible?&#x201D; Xiao Yan let out a cold laugh. A fury surged into his crimson eyes as he thundered, &#x201C;I will not stop as long as the Misty Cloud Sect continues to exist within the Jia Ma Empire. Only blood can wash away the blood feud of my Xiao clan!&#x201D;</p><p>Yun Yun&#x2019;s bright eyes stared intently at Xiao Yan&#x2019;s face which had somewhat lost his sense of reasoning. A sadness surfaced on the corner of her mouth. Her voice was hoarse as she spoke, &#x201C;Must you really turn things to such a stage in order to be happy? The Misty Cloud Sect has currently paid for the blood debt. Can&#x2019;t you show mercy?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Ha ha! Ha&#x2026; ha&#x2026;&#x201D;</p><p>Xiao Yan merely laughed crazily when he heard Yun Yun&#x2019;s words. However, everyone could hear the fury within his laughter.</p><p>&#x201C;Show mercy? Did the Misty Cloud Sect show mercy when it crushed my Xiao clan? If not for the help of the Primer clan, it is likely that the members of my Xiao clan would have been completely wiped out by your Misty Cloud Sect. Did anyone show any mercy back then?&#x201D;</p><p>A paleness surfaced on Yun Yun&#x2019;s pretty face. Her lovely body trembled slightly. Each word that Xiao Yan spoke was sharp, causing her to lack any reason to retort. This was because all of these matters were all started by the Misty Cloud Sect. The Xiao clan had been the victim from the very start.</p><p>&#x201C;I know that the Misty Cloud Sect is at fault with regards to the matter of the Xiao clan. No matter how one put it, however, I am the Sect Leader of the Misty Cloud Sect. I will do my best to stop you if you want to destroy this sect. Even if I have to risk this life of mine&#x2026;&#x201D; Yun Yun&#x2019;s face was bitter as she inhaled a deep breath of air and slowly spoke.</p><p>Xiao Yan&#x2019;s fist trembled as it tightened when he watched the bitterness and determination on Yun Yun&#x2019;s face. A moment later, he furiously roared, &#x201C;Yun Yun, don&#x2019;t think that I will let the Misty Cloud Sect off because of this. I have said that between the Xiao clan and the Misty Cloud Sect, only one party can exist within the Jia Ma Empire. I will not change this for anyone, including you!&#x201D;</p><p>Yun Yun let out a bitter smile as her bright eyes stared at the young face which was covered with anger. She had caused him to be disappointed back then. Today, she was afraid that she would have to disappoint him once again.</p><p>&#x201C;Since that is the case, you should defeat me first. I think that it should be very easy given your strength now.&#x201D; Yun Yun tightened her delicate hand and a green-colored longsword flashed and appeared. She lifted her pretty face and spoke quietly.</p><p>&#x201C;Yun Yun! You better not go overboard!&#x201D;</p><p>Xiao Yan&#x2019;s heart was immediately furious when he saw that Yun Yun actually lifted her sword toward him. His face was ferocious as he cried out.</p><p>&#x201C;I&#x2019;m sorry&#x2026; sorry&#x2026;&#x201D; The back of Yun Yun&#x2019;s teeth bit her lower lip as she looked at the savage fury on Xiao Yan&#x2019;s face. She shook her head slowly, knowing that this action had caused Xiao Yan quite a lot of harm. However, she was the Sect Leader of the Misty Cloud Sect. Having the concept poured into her since she was young caused her to be unable to abandon it.</p><p>Xiao Yan&#x2019;s eyes furiously looked at the gently trembling lovely figure of Yun Yun. He clenched his teeth firmly. A moment later, he suddenly took out a large amount of medicinal pills from his storage ring and wildly threw them into his mouth. His weakened aura recovered a little as the medicinal pills entered his body. However, this kind of forceful overdraft method was not considered a good one. Once the medicinal strength was over, that weakness would increase by many times than what it was before. However, the current Xiao Yan was totally unconcerned about all this.</p><p>&#x201C;Xiao Yan, you should not fight. There are still us around&#x2026;&#x201D; Hai Bodong looked at Xiao Yan&#x2019;s action and hurriedly spoke. He clearly understood that this fellow was already somewhat irrational after having received so many blows.</p><p>&#x201C;I will do it myself!&#x201D; Xiao Yan&#x2019;s voice was hoarse as he spoke. His mouth did its best to chew the medicinal pills while his gaze firmly started at Yun Yun below.</p><p>Yun Yun also let out a bitter smile as she sensed the Dou Qi that was slowly surging out from Xiao Yan&#x2019;s body. Her hand clenched the longsword. What awaited her was the fight that she dreaded the most within her heart.</p><p>&#x201C;Teacher&#x2026;&#x201D; Nalan Yanran&#x2019;s body by the side flashed and appeared in front of Yun Yun when she saw the Dou Qi surging out from his body. She softly said, &#x201C;Allow me to do it&#x2026; things developed to this stage because of my stubborness back then.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;You are not wrong in not wanting to marry a person you did not like back then&#x2026;&#x201D; Yun Yun sighed.</p><p>&#x201C;However, I am at the very least a member of the Misty Cloud Sect. This disciple will naturally not sit idle if he wants to destroy the Misty Cloud Sect. Leave this battle to me.&#x201D; Nalan Yanran smiled toward Yun Yun before immediately raising her head to look at Xiao Yan in the sky. He clear voice sounded, &#x201C;Xiao Yan, I also regret what happened during these three years. However, I am also a member of the Misty Cloud Sect. Hence, if you want to destroy the Misty Cloud Sect&#x2026;&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;You should fight with me first!&#x201D;</p><p>Nalan Yanran inhaled a deep breath of air. A powerful Dou Qi suddenly surged out from Nalan Yanran&#x2019;s body!</p><p>&#x201C;Yanran! This is a matter between the Misty Cloud Sect and Xiao Yan. You should not meddle in other people&#x2019;s business!&#x201D; The expressions of Nalan Jie and Nalan Su in the sky immediately changed when Nalan Yanran stepped forward. They hurriedly cried out a warning. It was obvious that the current Misty Cloud Sect was in a precarious state. Given Xiao Yan&#x2019;s current strength, it was not difficult for him to destroy it. Nalan Yanran was naturally unable to win if she opposed him. If she was not careful, she might anger Xiao Yan once again and even cause the Nalan clan to suffer for it.</p><p>Nalan Yanran slowly shook her head as she raised it and looked at Nalan Jie and Nalan Su. A stubborness surfaced in her pretty eyes, &#x201C;All of my abilities are passed on to me by teacher and the Misty Cloud Sect. I will definitely not sit idly and watch at such a time!&#x201D;</p><p>Nalan Jie and Nalan Su were so angry at seeing Nalan Yanran being so stubborn that the two of them jumped on the spot. However, they did not have any choice. At this moment, the latter&#x2019;s strength had clearly exceeded theirs.</p><p>&#x201C;Mister Xiao Yan, please do not attack just yet. Allow the old me to properly pursuade this girl!&#x201D; Nalan Jie suddenly saw Xiao Yan&#x2019;s slowly darkening face and hurriedly spoke while he was jumping on the spot.</p><p>Xiao Yan waved his hand and interrupted the words from Nalan Jie&#x2019;s mouth. He did not even look at him. His gaze was focused intently on the stubborn-faced Nalan Yanran below. A silver glow flickered and appeared under her feet. An instant later, he flapped his wings and his figure transformed into a light figure that suddenly rushed down.</p><p>The frightening speed that Xiao Yan suddenly displayed caused Nalan Yanran&#x2019;s face to change slightly. Her hand immediately moved and a sharp sword aura shot out from her palm before piercing toward the blurry figure.</p><p>&#x201C;Chi! Chi! Chi! Chi! Chi!&#x201D;</p><p>The black figure moved strangely in the sky and immediately dodged that sword aura. The blackish-jade-green flame suddenly became darker and a faint thunder roar resounded in the sky. Immediately, the black figure that Xiao Yan had transformed into disappeared!</p><p>Nalan Yanran was startled by Xiao Yan&#x2019;s sudden disappearance. Shock immediately surfaced in her eyes. This speed&#x2026; how was it possible that an expert Dou Wang could possess it?</p><p>The space in front of her rippled unusually just as Nalan Yanran was absent-minded because of this. A ghost-like black figure suddenly appeared.</p><p>Nalan Yanran&#x2019;s eyes shrank slightly. She moved her hand and a powerful Dou Qi was ruthlessly shot out.</p><p>Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang!</p><p>A wisp of dark-green flames flashed and appeared. It collided with that Dou Qi and immediately burst apart amid a low, deep sound.</p><p>The two attacks swiftly annihilated each other. Nalan Yanran had just withdrawn when a black figure instantly penetrated the resistance of the air. He firmly grabbed her long neck, causing her lovely body to stiffen.</p><p>&#x201C;Although the both of us are at the peak of the Dou Wang class, I only need a few exchanges to kill you!&#x201D;</p><p>The cold voice slowly sounded before Xiao Yan&#x2019;s body appeared in front of Nalan Yanran like a ghost. At this moment, his hand was firmly grabbing the latter&#x2019;s throat. All he needed was to unleash a little force in order to break her neck!</p>
