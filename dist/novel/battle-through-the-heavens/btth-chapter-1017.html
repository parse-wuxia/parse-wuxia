<p><strong><u>Chapter 1017: Lightning Mountain</u></strong></p><p>Xiao Yan found a deserted spot on the mountain peak and landed on the ground. After which, he headed to the foot of the mountain. He helplessly shook his head when he saw the densely packed human flow outside of the Wind Lightning Mountain Range. It was likely that these people were all here because of the Four Pavilion Grand Meeting&#x2026;</p><p>&#x201C;I wonder if the Four Pavilion Grand Meeting has begun?&#x201D; Xiao Yan muttered softly to himself before he suddenly took out a thin transparent skin-like item from his Storage Ring. After which, he covered it over his face. Almost instantly, some changes occurred on the contours of his face. If one did not look carefully, it would likely be difficult for one to recognize him.</p><p>This item, that could slightly alter one&#x2019;s appearance, was a little thing the Little Fairy Doctor had given him when they headed to the Chu Yun Empire back then. It was unexpected that it would still be of use after so many years had passed.</p><p>He was hiding his appearance in order to save himself some trouble. Currently, everyone was aware of his enmity with the Wind Lightning Pavilion. If he were to openly appear in this place, it was likely that the Wind Lightning Pavilion would not simply stand idly by the side. There were many experts within the eastern pavilion. Moreover, the Wind Lightning Pavilion&#x2019;s chief resided here. Even though Xiao Yan had broken through to the Dou Zong class, he could only choose to avoid a head-on confrontation when meeting with an expert of this level.</p><p>The reason he had come to the Wind Lightning Mountain Range was to search for Feng zun-zhe. Unless he had no choice, he did not wish to expose himself. After all, he would place himself in a dangerous position if that occurred. Therefore, hiding his appearance was indeed necessary.</p><p>Xiao Yan rubbed his face after having altered his appearance. After which, he walked out of the dense forest, joined the human flow on the main road that led into the mountain range, and moved toward the Wind Lightning Mountain Range.</p><p>The various noises within the noisy human flow, which Xiao Yan had joined, caused his ears to feel a ringing sensation. However, Xiao Yan could only laugh as he forcefully endured it.</p><p>&#x201C;Dammit, there are too many people. Can the eastern pavilion accommodate so many people?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;The Grand Meeting is about to begin today. Naturally, there will be a lot of people. It is rumored that the people from the four pavilions have already arrived.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;The final victor in the last competition was the Wind Lightning Pavilion. I wonder just who will be the victor this time around?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;It is difficult to say. Feng Qing Er, Tang Ying, Wang Chen, and that Mu Qing Luan are no ordinary people. It is rumored that these four entered the Heaven Eye Mountain Range&#x2019;s Heaven Mountain Blood Pool some time ago. Their strength will definitely have improved. Hee hee, I wonder if any one of them borrowed the strength of the Blood Pool to break through the Dou Huang class?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;These four people have the strength at the peak of the Dou Huang class. Adding their tactics, they are even able to exchange blows with some expert Dou Zongs. Whoever is able to breakthrough during this period of time will definitely win.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Who knows. There are an unknown number of talented individuals in the Central Plains. There are always some dark horses appearing in each of the Four Pavilion Grand Meetings. I wonder just who will appear this time around?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Dark horse huh. Naturally, it is that young man called Xiao Yan, who has stirred an uproar within the northern region recently. Even the Wind Lightning Northern Pavilion&#x2019;s chief returned empty-handed after personally chasing him. One can just imagine how terrifyingly strong he is.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Qi&#x2026; Xiao Yan might be strong, but this place in the headquarters of the Wind Lightning Pavilion. Do you think that he dares to come here?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;...&#x201D;</p><p>Xiao Yan was involuntarily startled when he heard the conversation around him eventually talking about him. His hands could not help, but rub his face. It was unexpected that he possessed such a reputation in this northern region. However, this was not what he wanted. If his name were to spread to the ears of the &#x2018;Hall of Souls,&#x2019; it was likely that things would become even more troublesome.</p><p>Xiao Yan successfully entered through the entrance of the mountain range amid a terrible noise. There were disciples from the Wind Lightning Pavilion maintaining order around the entrance. Other than some special guests, ordinary people were not allowed to fly in the air above the Wind Lightning Mountain Range. This had resulted in Xiao Yan, who did not wish to expose his identity, being forced to walk in.</p><p>Upon entering the mountain range, Xiao Yan swiftly separated himself from most of the human flow. After which, he turned to a deserted forest, increased his speed, and swiftly rushed to the interior of the mountain range. From the information that he had heard earlier, today should be the start of the Four Pavilion Grand Meeting. Moreover, the thing that excited Xiao Yan most was that the people from the four pavilions had arrived, which meant Feng zun-zhe should have arrived.</p><p>&#x201C;If I really meet Feng zun-zhe, it is best to observe him quietly before making contact with him. Although teacher has said that I can trust him completely, it is always best to be careful.&#x201D; Xiao Yan&#x2019;s figure transformed into a blurry one that shuffled through the mountain range while this thought lingered in his heart.</p><p>The heavy burden of rescuing Yao Lao and his father were things that Xiao Yan needed to complete. Hence, he needed to ensure his safety. It was best to be cautious about any uncertain factors.</p><p>The Wind Lightning Mountain Range was extremely vast. Even with Xiao Yan&#x2019;s speed, he still spent nearly half an hour before reaching the middle of the mountain range. There was a magnificent and steep mountain located at that spot, Lightning Mountain!</p><p>Lightning Mountain was extremely tall. One was unable to see its peak when looking up from its base. The middle portion of the mountain was covered in a dense fog. This fog was a little dark, and it faintly contained lightning flashing within it. Looking from a distance, this mountain peak seemed to be covered by a countless number of bolts of lightning, making it appear extremely majestic.</p><p>Xiao Yan let out a praise for the towering Lightning Mountain before moving his body to land somewhere near its base. The top of the Lightning Mountain was the Wind Lightning Pavilion. The defenses of that place were unusually tight. Perhaps it was due to the Grand Meeting approaching, but the surrounding defenses had also been fortified. There would occasionally be human figures flapping Dou Qi wings in the sky. The Lightning Mountain had entered into a tight inspection network.</p><p>In order to not alert the experts in the Wind Lightning Pavilion, Xiao Yan would naturally not adopt such a brutal break in method. The line at the foot of the mountain might be long, but Xiao Yan still possessed a little bit of patience.</p><p>Xiao Yan advanced along with the group and finally came to a stop when he was about to ascend the mountain. At this moment, there were two rock roads that led up the mountain. One was provided for those people, who had come to watch the Grand Meeting, while the other was provided for some of the young experts who had come to participate in the Grand Meeting.</p><p>There were nearly a hundred armored disciples from the Wind Lightning Pavilion guarding the front of the two rock roads. Their stern expressions brought about some pressure. This resulted in no one daring to cause trouble. Additionally, there were two old people in front of these hundred disciples. One was a male while the other was a female. Xiao Yan&#x2019;s eyes solidified when his gaze swept over these two people because the two of them were the two who had accompanied Feng Qing Er to the Heaven Eye Mountain Range back then.</p><p>&#x201C;The strength of these two is quite impressive. I wonder if I will be able to pass through their inspection after having altered my appearance.&#x201D; Xiao Yan slightly frowned.</p><p>&#x201C;It is unexpected that the participants of this competition are filtered by the Huo Mu Elders of the eastern pavilion this time around. These two people hold quite a high position within the Wind Lightning Pavilion. The Wind Lightning Pavilion selections have always been harsh. After seeing this today, they do live up to their reputation. Fortunately, I am only here to watch the fun and need to pass through their verification&#x2026;&#x201D; A group of people in front of Xiao Yan softly conversed while he was frowning.</p><p>Xiao Yan&#x2019;s heart leaped when he heard this. It seemed that not everyone must be examined by these two people.</p><p>&#x201C;I think that everyone is aware of the rules of my Wind Lightning Pavilion. Anyone who wishes to participate in the Grand Meeting must first reach the strength of a three star Dou Huang or higher. Secondly, he or she must be less than thirty years old. Third, this person must last over five exchanges in the hands of the old me. Only by meeting these three conditions will one possess the qualification to participate. Of course, if you are only here to watch the fun, you can just climb the mountain using the left stone road.&#x201D; A red-clothed Elder Huo explained while everyone was engaged in private conversations.</p><p>Quite a big commotion was stirred when these words sounded. Just fulfilling one of these three criteria was not an easy matter, much less all three of them. It was really strict.</p><p>Most of the people chose the road on the left side under such strict criteria. Xiao Yan hesitated for a moment before following the human flow to the left rock road. His aim was merely to find Feng zun-zhe. He was not interested in fighting within the Wind Lightning Pavilion. Some trouble would be unavoidable if he ended up recognized by others.</p><p>While most people were climbing the rock road on the left side, there were also a couple of young people, who felt that they were quite strong, intending to attempt the right path. However, all of them were swept aside by Elder Huo without exception. These people might have barely met the requirement of a three star Dou Huang, but it was clear that they were those that relied on medicinal pills or some natural treasure to support them. Their fighting strengths were similar to that of a two star Dou Huang.</p><p>The Huo Mu Elders did not even raise their eyes when fighting these weak fellows. Xiao Yan by the side also laughed in his heart when he saw this. After which, he increased his speed and stepped onto the rock road on the left.</p><p>&#x201C;Wait!&#x201D;</p><p>Xiao Yan&#x2019;s feet had just stepped on the rock road when Elder Huo by the side suddenly turned his head before Xiao Yan could even climb up. Elder Huo frowned as he looked at Xiao Yan.</p><p>The fist under Xiao Yan sleeves was tightened when he heard this cry. He turned his head slowly and looked at Elder Huo.</p><p>Elder Huo&#x2019;s eyes slowly swept over Xiao Yan&#x2019;s face before faintly saying, &#x201C;You seem to have reached the qualification to participate in the competition. Why don&#x2019;t you give it a try?&#x201D;</p><p>Numerous gazes shot to Xiao Yan when these words sounded. There were many people earlier who had not passed the test, yet this fellow, who appeared ordinary, possessed such ability?</p><p>&#x201C;I am not interested in the Grand Meeting. The reason I have come here is to search for someone.&#x201D; Xiao Yan&#x2019;s voice appeared a little hoarse under his suppression. After saying these words, he ignored Elder Huo, turned around, and climbed to the top of the mountain, leaving behind a group of stunned gazes in the process.</p><p>&#x201C;This fellow&#x2026; is too arrogant, no?&#x201D;</p><p>The old woman beside Elder Huo knit her brows, glanced at Xiao Yan&#x2019;s back, and asked, &#x201C;Is there something wrong with that person?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;I don&#x2019;t know&#x2026; I only sensed the natural fire affinity energy suddenly fluctuate a little when he stepped onto the stone road. For some unknown reason, this person gives me a kind of inexplicable feeling&#x2026;&#x201D; Elder Huo knit his brows and bitterly laughed. He sighed, &#x201C;It is most likely just an illusion&#x2026;&#x201D;</p>
