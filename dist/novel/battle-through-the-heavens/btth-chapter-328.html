<p><strong><u>Chapter 328: Awakening of Yao Lao?</u></strong></p><p>Xiao Yan was in a rush as he left the Nalan clan. He wanted to quickly return to the inn where he stayed when he suddenly paused his footsteps. In order to refine the &#x2018;Seven Magical Green Spirit Saliva&#x2019; into liquid, he would naturally need a medicinal cauldron. That cauldron of his, however, had already been destroyed during the Grand Meeting&#x2026;</p><p>Xiao Yan shook his head. He hesitated for a moment before he hurriedly walked toward the Primer Auction House. As he was afraid that he would be delayed if he met Ya Fei, Xiao Yan simply bought a medicinal cauldron that was approximately the same tier as the one he previously had from the exterior of the auction house. He then hurried back to the inn he was staying at without stopping.</p><p>With complete focus, Xiao Yan rushed back to the inn, entered his room and turned his hand around to shut the door tightly. He strode into the interior of the room. Only after he exhaled a few coarse breaths did he finally take out the &#x2018;Seven Magical Green Spirit Saliva&#x2019; and place it on the table.</p><p>Sitting by the side of the table, Xiao Yan&#x2019;s gaze stared directly at this extremely beautiful plant for a long while before letting out a long sigh. After spending so much effort, he had finally got his hands on it. It was just that he did not know if it would be of any use to Teacher.</p><p>Xiao Yan slowly calmed his agitated feelings. He carefully shut all the windows before returning to the table side and attentively studied the &#x2018;Seven Magical Green Spirit Saliva&#x2019; that was repeatedly changing color. With the beckoning with his hand, a red colored medicinal cauldron appeared on the table.</p><p>As he placed his hand on the jade pot that contained the &#x2018;Seven Magical Green Spirit Saliva&#x2019;, Xiao Yan suddenly released a hidden strength in his palm. A &#x2018;crack&#x2019; was heard and crack lines that swiftly began spreading appeared like a spider web on the surface of the jade pot.</p><p>Xiao Yan&#x2019;s finger pressed on the jade pot that was filled with crack lines. Instantly, the latter completely broke apart, revealing the roots of the &#x2018;Seven Magical Green Spirit Saliva&#x2019; that were wrapped by the soil within it.</p><p>After musing for a while as he observed the moist soil, Xiao Yan&#x2019;s palm once again nestled close to it. A faint green colored flame seedling emitted a high temperature which quickly grilled the moist soil until it was dry. At this moment, his palm gently patted it and all the soil that was wrapped outside the &#x2018;Seven Magical Green Spirit Saliva&#x2019; began shedding itself, revealing the lower portion of the roots which were not the least bit damaged.</p><p>Xiao Yan&#x2019;s palm curled slightly and a gentle suction force slowly pulled up the &#x2018;Seven Magical Green Spirit Saliva&#x2019; which was then carefully placed into the medicinal cauldron.</p><p>His palm rotated slightly and a contracted green colored flame was spat out from it. Xiao Yan flicked his finger and the flame seedling was swiftly and abruptly inserted into the medicinal cauldron, revolving around the &#x2018;Seven Magical Green Spirit Saliva&#x2019; a couple of times.</p><p>When the green colored flame appeared, the high temperature that it carried caused the &#x2018;Seven Magical Green Spirit Saliva&#x2019;, which was originally like green jade, to quickly began to wither. Although the branches and leaves withered away, the seven-colored flower&#x2019;s color became increasingly brighter. The moment the branches and leaves completely turned into ashes and disappeared, the color of the flower was so bright that it caused the eyes of those who looked at it to feel a piercing pain. Additionally, a rich fragrance, much like that of a vintage wine that was buried underground for a long time, began to slowly seep out from the fire outlet of the medicinal cauldron.</p><p>Xiao Yan&#x2019;s entire spirit was stimulated as he inhaled a breath of the rich fragrance. He was surprised to realize that his tiredness, which was a lingering undesirable effect of the competition despite his rest during the daytime, had actually completely disappeared.</p><p>&#x201C;Tsk tsk. This is indeed something good. Just the fragrance from the flower has this strange effect comparable to a tier three medicinal pill. It is likely to have some effect on those exhausted spirits.&#x201D; Xiao Yan let out a praise as he threw his gaze to the medicinal cauldron. His finger moved slightly and the green colored flame which was surrounding the seven-colored flower, abruptly leaped forward, wrapping around the latter. After which, the flame began to violently burn it...</p><p>As the flame writhed, Xiao Yan, who was staring at the medicinal cauldron, abruptly let out a soft &#x2018;eh&#x2019;. He realized that when the &#x2018;Seven Magical Green Spirit Saliva&#x2019; was being calcined by the flame, the seven-colored light that was repeatedly changing was actually able to contend with the &#x2018;Green Lotus Core Flame&#x2019;, attempting to preserve its entire self within the flame.</p><p>&#x201C;Hei, this thing is indeed no ordinary thing. It is actually able to withstand the &#x2018;Heavenly Flame&#x2019; temperature for such a long time. But&#x2026; this is merely so.&#x201D; Xiao Yan softly laughed as he realized that as the &#x2018;Underground Green Lotus Flame&#x2019; repeatedly soared, the seven-colored light that was contending with it gradually weakened. From the looks of it, the energy that the seven-colored light could use was limited.</p><p>Xiao Yan waved his palm gently and another cluster of green-colored flame spewed into the medicinal cauldron. Immediately, the temperature of the green-colored flame once again surged. After a moment, it completely swallowed the resisting seven-colored glow in one swoop&#x2026;</p><p>Once the seven-colored glow disappeared, the seven-colored flower flower immediately became unbearably weak. With just a movement from the flame seedling, the flower petals swiftly withered. Droplets of seven-colored dew seeped out from the withering flower petals and flickered with a strange luster.</p><p>As the seven-colored flower was completely withered, the numerous tiny droplets of seven-colored dewdrops began to slowly merge together, much like a bright pearl emitting a seven-colored glow, appearing very attractive.</p><p>&#x201C;It should be like this, no?&#x201D; Xiao Yan muttered to himself. Not long after the seven-colored dew drop appeared, he withdrew the flame. He beckoned with his hand and the cover of the caudron was opened. The seven-colored dewdrop flew out and drew a rainbow arc in midair.</p><p>The seven-colored dewdrop that flew up was slowly suspended around half an inch from Xiao Yan&#x2019;s palm. As it moved the weak seven-colored glow quietly expanded and contracted.</p><p>&#x201C;This&#x2026; how do I use it?&#x201D; Xiao Yan blinked his eyes uncertainly. He had used his spiritual strength to sweep over it once, only to realize that the seven-colored dewdrop contained a type of strange energy that would cause the spirit to jump for joy. However&#x2026; what did he need to do in order to let Yao Lao absorb it?</p><p>Xiao Yan moved his right hand a little lower and shortened the distance between the seven-colored suspending dewdrop and the dark black ring on his left hand. With a bitter smile, he said, &#x201C;Don&#x2019;t tell me that I should just throw it in like this?&#x201D; Xiao Yan knew that this dark black ring also contained a storage ability similar to a storage ring. However, this thing appeared to only listen to Yao Lao&#x2019;s command. With Xiao Yan&#x2019;s Spiritual Strength it was impossible for him to enter.</p><p>Xiao Yan vexed over it for a while with a frown, but still did not have any idea how to proceed. He could only carefully stick the seven-colored dewdrop toward the dark black ring.</p><p>Following the shortening of the gap between the two things, Xiao Yan abruptly realized that the the dark black ring which had always appeared ancient and deep suddenly become much brighter!</p><p>&#x201C;It is indeed effective&#x2026;&#x201D; A great joy appeared in Xiao Yan&#x2019;s heart as he discovered this occurrence. He did not hesitate any longer. With a movement of his hand, the seven-colored dewdrop suddenly smashed against the ring.</p><p>The collision between the two of them did not cause the seven-colored dewdrop to slide off the ring. Instead, it strangely adhered to the surface of the ring. In a moment, the dark black ring appeared to have turned into something made of seven different colors.</p><p>As the seven-colored glow bloomed, a black-colored glow was gradually emitted from deep within the dark black ring. The seven-colored glow appeared to be swallowed by this black-colored glow that was shining onto it, becoming weaker at a speed that was visible to the naked eye. Following the weakening of the seven-colored glow, the black-colored one became increasingly dense.</p><p>Eyeing this strange occurrence that had happened on the ring, a wild joy surfaced on Xiao Yan&#x2019;s face. He could vaguely sense that there was a spirit which he was familiar with slowly recovering.</p><p>The dark glow on the black-colored ring was becoming increasingly dense. Finally, it appeared to be like a bottomless pit.. At one instance, the ring suddenly fell from Xiao Yan&#x2019;s finger and slowly suspended in front of the latter. The dark black glow was withdrawn and spat out while repeating this cycle tirelessly.</p><p>&#x201C;Teacher? Have you awakened?&#x201D; As he eyed the dark black ring in front of him, Xiao Yan could not resist asking in a somewhat agitated manner.</p><p>There was no reply to Xiao Yan&#x2019;s words. The dark black ring simply floated in this manner, but Yao Lao&#x2019;s figure did not appear as Xiao Yan had imagined.</p><p>&#x201C;What is happening?&#x201D; Xiao Yan parted his mouth slightly, feeling a little lost. He was about to extend his hand to retrieve the ring when the latter, which had been quiet all this while, suddenly trembled violently. A vast and terrifying Spiritual Strength suddenly turned into the form of ripples and burst apart with the ring at its center.</p><p>The Spiritual Energy Explosion that had suddenly appeared caused Xiao Yan&#x2019;s expression to change greatly. If this terrifying spiritual assaulting wave were to strike him, it was likely that his spirit would instantly be destroyed!</p><p>Xiao Yan&#x2019;s eyes stared intently at the Spiritual Energy ripples that had spread apart. He forcefully suppressed the panic in his heart. It was impossible for him to escape from attacks at this proximity. Moreover, he also believed that Yao Lao would not harm him.</p><p>The Spiritual Energy ripples surged out in a lightning like manner. Just before it came into contact with Xiao Yan, a certain region of the ripple suddenly paused and then disappeared...</p><p>The spiritual ripple attack leaped over Xiao Yan and violently surged toward the roof.</p><p>&#x201C;Glug&#x2026;&#x201D;</p><p>The vague spiritual ripple did not damage anything on the roof which was void of people. However, under a dark black spot, a human figure was suddenly catapulted out. A mouthful of fresh blood was involuntarily spat out. The moonlight scattering on the figure revealed an old face with a somewhat dark complexion.</p><p>&#x201C;This is bad. That fellow has awakened again&#x2026; In the future, I cannot be in such close proximity to him. This bastard. He knew that I don&#x2019;t have any evil intent, yet he still uses such a powerful attack!&#x201D; The black shadow wiped off the blood traces from the corner of his mouth as he scolded. His toes gently pressed on the empty space, and then his body disappeared far into the darkness in a few flashes.</p><p>In an isolated town tens of kilometers from the capital, Hai Bodong indifferently stared at a human ice sculpture below him. He carelessly threw a falling leaf onto the ice sculpture. The falling leaf floated in the air as it slowly descended.</p><p>TL: Yes, it&#x2019;s Yan Li.</p><p>&#x201C;Let&#x2019;s go.&#x201D; Hai Bodong raised his head and spoke to the two shadows on the tree branches above him with a smile.</p><p>&#x201C;Yes.&#x201D; Fa Ma and Jia Lao nodded slightly. They were just about to move when their faces suddenly changed. Suddenly, they turned their heads around and threw their gazes toward the distant huge capital.</p><p>&#x201C;What a strong spirit!&#x201D; An exclamation was simultaneously emitted from the mouths of the two of them without any prior planning. Immediately, the two of the exchanged glances and both were able to see a grave expression in both of their eyes.</p><p>&#x201C;Why is there such a strong person appearing in the capital? Why did we not hear of any news?&#x201D; Jua Lao said in a soft and deep voice. As the guardian of the Imperial family, he must immediately be aware of any strong person suddenly appearing in the capital.</p><p>&#x201C;I don&#x2019;t know. This spirit is far too strong, far from what I can compare with&#x2026;&#x201D; Fa Ma soft voice contained aghast.</p><p>On another tree, Hai Bodong also turned his head around and eyed the direction of the capital. His mouth widened slightly and a surprise gradually appeared in his eyes, &#x201C;This spiritual strength appears to be from within that little fellow, Xiao Yan&#x2019;s body? He&#x2026; has he recovered his strength?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Let&#x2019;s go. We should go back and take a look!&#x201D; Hai Bodong narrowed his eyes. He did not tell Fa Ma or Jia Lao about the origin of this Spiritual Strength. He simply randomly said something and in a flash, flew quickly toward the capital.</p><p>&#x201C;Yes.&#x201D; Fa Ma and Jia Lao nodded. Their bodies soared up and followed closely behind Hai Bodong.</p><p>As the three of them disappeared the floating, falling leaf finally landed on the ice sculpture. Immediately, a clear cracking sound appeared and the ice sculpture suddenly burst apart. Ice dust filled the sky before gradually disappearing under the glow of the moon...</p>
