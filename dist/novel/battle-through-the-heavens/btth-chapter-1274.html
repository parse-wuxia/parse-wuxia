<p><strong><u>Chapter 1274: Tian Class Dou Techniques</u></strong></p><p>Yao Lao sat on the leader&#x2019;s seat in the spacious large hall. His eyes were shut. Vast and mighty Spiritual Strength vibrated around his body, causing the surrounding space to form some slight distortion. The current Yao Lao might not have a much greater Spiritual Strength than before but the fluctuating Spiritual Strength gave one a feeling of being filled with life. It appeared as though it possessed an even greater liveliness than the Spiritual Strength of the past.</p><p>&#x201C;Teacher, is it possible for you to replenish your essence spiritual aura?&#x201D;</p><p>Xiao Yan, who had received the news, hurriedly walked into the large hall. His eyes glanced at Yao Lao on the leader&#x2019;s seat. With his current ability, Xiao Yan was naturally able to sense the change in Yao Lao&#x2019;s current Spiritual Strength. Immediately, he spoke in a joyous manner.</p><p>Yao Lao slowly opened his eyes. He looked at Xiao Yan, who was swiftly walking over before smiling and nodding his head. He said, &#x201C;The golden grade Soul Baby Fruit&#x2019;s medicinal effect is unexpectedly strong. My essence spiritual aura has once again recovered to the peak&#x2026;&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Then the matter of refining a body can begin right?&#x201D; Xiao Yan spoke somewhat anxiously.</p><p>&#x201C;Refining a body still requires various different ingredients&#x2026;&#x201D; Yao Lao smilingly replied.</p><p>&#x201C;You can rest assured. This disciple has already gathered all these ingredients during these years&#x2026;&#x201D; Xiao Yan smilingly said. He flicked his finger and a jade bottle appeared in his hand. A dragon eye large medicinal pill was rotating and dripping. A pill fragrance that was so rich, it was impossible to recover, spread out from within it. This caused one&#x2019;s mind to be braced.</p><p>&#x201C;This is&#x2026; tier 8 medicinal pill?&#x201D; A surprise immediately surfaced in Feng zun-zhe&#x2019;s eyes as he said when he looked at the medicinal pill.</p><p>&#x201C;Yes&#x2026; moreover, it is a tier 8 medicinal pill that has experienced five Pill Lightning.&#x201D; Yao Lao nodded slowly. He immediately revealed the number of pill lightning colors that this medicinal pill had experienced. Immediately, he looked at Xiao Yan in a pleased manner and said, &#x201C;Your alchemist skill has not be neglected during these years.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Ha ha, old fellow, you can rest assured about this. Xiao Yan is also a Pill Gathering champion. He is not any lousier than you when you were young.&#x201D; Feng zun-zhe fondled his beard and laughed out loud.</p><p>&#x201C;Teacher, this is the Bone Growing Blood Fusing Pill.&#x201D; Xiao Yan&#x2019;s finger was gently flicked onto the jade bottle and the latter slowly drifted in front of Yao Lao. Immediately, Xiao Yan took out another transparent jade bottle again. There was a couple of green-red drops of blood within the jade bottle. A frighteningly pure energy spread from within it.</p><p>&#x201C;This is the essence blood of a Heaven Demon Phoenix. It might lack in quantity but it will be of big use.&#x201D; Xiao Yan smilingly said. This was naturally the essence blood that Xiao Yan had refined from the Heaven Demon Phoenix bones back then.</p><p>&#x201C;As for a skeleton, I have one that belongs to the peak of the Dou Zong class&#x2026;&#x201D; Xiao Yan waved his hand randomly. A corpse that was sealed in ice appeared within the large hall. The only one amongst these three ingredients that Xiao Yan was dissatisfied with was this skeleton. If it was in the past, he might feel a little joy at the skeleton of someone at the peak of the Dou Zong class. However, with the rise in his level, a skeleton of such a strength was no longer able to attract Xiao Yan&#x2019;s notice.</p><p>&#x201C;Ke ke, if it is a skeleton, I do have one that belongs to a four star Dou Zun here&#x2026;&#x201D; Feng zun-zhe by the side laughed. He waved his sleeve and a coffin landed on the ground. There was a pale-gray skeleton within the coffin. A faint fluorescence was flowing over the body of the skeleton.</p><p>&#x201C;This is an enemy of mine in the past. He subsequently died in my hands. I was afraid that no one would deal with his corpse so I ended up helping him keep it.&#x201D;</p><p>Xiao Yan was involuntarily a little speechless when he heard Feng zun-zhe&#x2019;s casual tone. It seemed that Feng zun-zhe possess quite a great enmity with this person. Otherwise, he would not deal with the other person&#x2019;s corpse.</p><p>&#x201C;All of these three ingredients are of top quality. The materials that we refine from them should be able to allow Yao Chen to recover to his previous peak strength. However, I wonder if he will be able to break through the Dou Zun class and reach the Dou Sheng class&#x2026;&#x201D; Feng zun-zhe fondled his beard and voiced his thoughts.</p><p>&#x201C;Difficult&#x2026;&#x201D;</p><p>Yao Lao shook his head. Dou Zun and Dou Sheng were two completely different levels. An elite Dou Zun could be considered a true top tier expert in the continent. A Dou Sheng, on the other hand, stood at the peak of a golden pagoda. Given the foundation of the Central Plains, elite Dou Zuns could be considered few but they were not especially rare. However, an elite Dou Sheng was entirely different. Just take Xiao Yan as an example. Despite him having arrived at the Central Plains for so many years, he had yet to meet a genuine elite Dou Sheng!</p><p>Of course, the precondition of this was that one did not include the Dou Sheng skeleton that Xiao Yan had met in the ancient remains. That thing merely had a little remnant elite Dou Sheng spirit. It could not be considered a true expert. Even though this was the case, the skeleton that had lost traces of life caused Xiao Yan, old ghost Zhai Xing and the other experts to appear extremely miserable. They nearly ended up falling in an unexpected situation. Through this case, it was possible to vaguely observe just how frightening a genuine Dou Sheng was.</p><p>That level truly possessed the great might to destroy the heavens and earth.</p><p>&#x201C;Since the ingredients are all gathered, we should act tomorrow. The earlier Yao Chen recovers his peak strength, the less the Falling Star Pavilion needs to worry about the revenge by the Hall of Soul. A branch hall of the Hall of Soul was destroyed and it was taken advantage of within the ancient remains. Given the way the Hall of Soul does things, it would definitely not easily swallow such a great loss.&#x201D; Feng zun-zhe voiced his thoughts.</p><p>&#x201C;Yes&#x2026;&#x201D;</p><p>Xiao Yan and Yao Lao nodded. Currently, everything might appear calm but it was obvious that this was the calm before the storm&#x2026;</p><p>After deciding with Yao Lao on the time to refine a body, Xiao Yan returned to his quarters due to it being late. Once he returned to his room, he sat on the bed and mused for a moment. He flipped his hand and three jade white ribs appeared within his palm.</p><p>The three ribs were naturally those that Xiao Yan had ripped from the skeleton. Inside it hid the secrets of the Tian class Dou Technique. However, ever since he returned to the Falling Star Pavilion, he had yet to carefully observe it due to him busily removing the poison from Qing Lin. After hearing Feng zun-zhe mention the matter of the Hall of Soul taking revenge soon, his heart had also become a little pressured. When faced with such a large faction, he must ultimately raise his own combat strength&#x2026;.</p><p>The best method to raise one&#x2019;s fighting strength was naturally to practice high class Dou Techniques. The legendary Tian class Dou Technique was very strong. Even at this moment, Xiao Yan was unable to forget the terrifying strength that was created when the Dou Sheng skeleton had unleashed the Tian class Dou Technique back then&#x2026;</p><p>The ribs felt cool when it entered Xiao Yan&#x2019;s hands. It did not possess the kind of rough feeling of a bone. Instead, it appeared just like a perfect jade when one touched it, appearing smooth and cool, giving one an extremely wonderful feeling.</p><p>The ribs were covered by tiny mysterious characters. These characters were unusually mysterious. It gave one an obscure feeling.</p><p>Xiao Yan carefully observed the three ribs in detail. He remembered those mysterious characters in his mind but he was unable to decipher them&#x2026;</p><p>&#x201C;Looks like an ordinary method will not be able to open these ribs&#x2026;&#x201D; Xiao Yan&#x2019;s face revealed an expression of deep thought. A moment later, he placed the ribs gently on his forehead. Spiritual Strength spread out. However, it was directly reflected back when it touched the ribs. Xiao Yan was immediately startled before he sighed in relief.</p><p>&#x201C;There is actually a seal on the surface of the bone&#x2026;&#x201D;</p><p>Xiao Yan clenched his hand after he had this thought. Purple-brown flame curled and rose from his palm. After which, it wrapped around three white jade-like ribs. A frightening temperature swiftly caused the air within the room to become dry.</p><p>&#x201C;Sizzle sizzle!&#x201D;</p><p>The frightening flame crazily grilled the bone. However, this seemingly weak bone did not move even a little. Its color did not even change a little.</p><p>Xiao Yan was not surprised at this situation. If it was so easy to break a seal placed by an elite Dou Sheng, it would appear far too much like child&#x2019;s play.</p><p>Xiao Yan maintained a calm mood. He steadily allowed the Three Thousand Lotus Heart Flame to continue grilling the three ribs. He slowly shut his eyes and actually directly entered his training mode.</p><p>The purple-brown flame burned fiercely within the room. The three ribs within it also vaguely emitted a faint glow&#x2026;</p><p>This grilling continued from the evening to late into the night, lasting for nearly ten hours. Under the crazy burning by the Three Thousand Lotus Heart Flame, the three ribs gradually changed a little. The kind of jade white color also slowly became pale. A kind of deep dark golden colour replaced it. If one was to look carefully, one would find a strange ripple quietly spreading under the golden light.</p><p>&#x201C;Chi!&#x201D;</p><p>A strange sound of flowing liquid was suddenly emitted from within the quiet room. Xiao Yan&#x2019;s tightly shut eyes were also slowly opened at this moment. His eyes looked towards the flame in front of him before becoming startled.</p><p>The flame at this moment no longer had any traces of the ribs within. Only a strange dark golden liquid remained. The liquid slowly flowed within the flame. It appeared to possess its own intelligence and would occasionally gather into various strange shapes.</p><p>&#x201C;This&#x2026; was this the manner after the seal has been opened?&#x201D;</p><p>Xiao Yan muttered softly. He hesitated for a moment before inhaling a deep breath of somewhat dry air. His hand was gently extended. After which, it reached into the flame and paused for a moment. Finally, a finger was inserted into the dark golden liquid.</p><p>&#x201C;Sizzle sizzle!&#x201D;</p><p>Xiao Yan&#x2019;s finger was inserted into the liquid and a change occurred. One could see the liquid suddenly wiggling intensely. After which, it firmly winded around Xiao Yan&#x2019;s finger. It wrapped around his entire hand in an instant.</p><p>&#x201C;Hiss!&#x201D;</p><p>The dark golden liquid wrapped around Xiao Yan&#x2019;s right hand. An intense pain that could not be contained was suddenly transmitted from his palm. This caused Xiao Yan&#x2019;s face to twitch. After being wrapped by the dark golden liquid, his hand actually began to wiggle strangely. The sound of bone being pressed together that was also emitted.</p><p>&#x201C;My hand is about to be crippled!&#x201D;</p><p>The squeezing feeling became increasingly intense. Just when Xiao Yan thought that his hand would be squeezed until it was shattered, the intense pain suddenly came to a halt. The dark golden liquid also flowed into his hand like floodwater and swiftly disappeared.</p><p>Xiao Yan did not even have the time to be stunned by this strange scene before his head suddenly shook at this moment. A golden light vaguely surfaced in his eyes. A low and deep muttered sound was also emitted from his mouth.</p><p>&#x201C;This is&#x2026; Great Heaven Creation Palm!&#x201D;</p>
