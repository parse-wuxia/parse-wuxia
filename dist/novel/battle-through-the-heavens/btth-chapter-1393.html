<p><strong><u>Chapter 1393: Eight Coloured Origin Stone</u></strong></p><p>Yao Lao smiled upon seeing the stunned expressions of Xiao Yan&#x2019;s trio. He waved his hand and said, &#x201C;Let&#x2019;s enter&#x2026;&#x201D;</p><p>Xiao Yan and the other two nodded when they heard Yao Lao&#x2019;s suggestion. Their bodies moved, and they rushed toward the towering sand mountain. They had appeared in front of the spatial black hole within a couple of flashes. There were occasionally some figures rushing by when the four of them arrived. Their eyes paused on Xiao Yan&#x2019;s group before taking a second glance at Cai Lin and the Little Fairy Doctor. Those who could come to this place were no fools. They were clearly aware of the type of people who would come. Hence, rarely would any foolish people purposefully step forward and find trouble.</p><p>Yao Lao ignored these gazes. He stepped through empty air and walked into the spatial black hole. Xiao Yan&#x2019;s group followed close behind. The three of them felt an unusual strength sweeping over them when they entered the spatial black hole. There was no ill intention to this force. Instead, it seemed like it was probing&#x2026;</p><p>Everything turned momentarily black in front of Xiao Yan&#x2019;s group after they entered the black hole. Soon after, light and noise began to appear. They blinked their eyes. The world in front of them had changed into a small town. When one&#x2019;s eyes glanced toward the sky of the small town, one would find that it was completely gray. There was a wild and violent spatial ripple vaguely being emitted.</p><p>&#x201C;This is Space Town, the location where the spatial trade fair is held&#x2026; although this place is not as spacious as the Gu Realm, it is large enough to be used as a trading location&#x2026;&#x201D; Yao Lao looked at the busy streets and laughed.</p><p>Xiao Yan and the other two nodded. Being able to create a realm as a trading location was quite a grand thing to do. Although this realm was not large, it was not something that an ordinary person could create.</p><p>&#x201C;Let&#x2019;s randomly roam first. There are no inferior products here. All of them are rare items.&#x201D; Yao Lao laughed. After which, he took a step and walked toward a street. Xiao Yan&#x2019;s group followed behind him with curious faces. Their eyes continued to sweep around them.</p><p>Green stone platforms filled both sides of the street. Things like scrolls, jade bottles, weapons, and monster core, had been placed on them. A faint light was being emitted from these objects, indicating that they were not ordinary things. Some human figures were seated behind the stone platforms, and all of these people boasted strong auras. Clearly, they were not people that one could easily offend.</p><p>&#x201C;Earth Demon Kick, Di class High grade Dou Skill&#x2026;&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Great Mysterious Skill, Di class High grade Qi Method&#x2026;&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Body Transformation Pill, tier 7 high grade medicinal pill&#x2026;&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Ten Thousand Year Old Bloody Spiritual Ginseng&#x2026;&#x201D;</p><p>Various dazzling items continued to enter Xiao Yan&#x2019;s sight while his eyes continued to leap around. The rarity of some of the things caused an excitement to rise within Xiao Yan&#x2019;s heart despite his calmness. The pretty eyes of Cai Lin and the Little Fairy Doctor by the side also revealed an unusual glitter.</p><p>&#x201C;Earth Core Spirit Serum. The medicinal pill refined by it can attract a six-colored Pill Lightning&#x2026;&#x201D; Xiao Yan&#x2019;s eyes swept over the medicinal ingredients that were emitting a shocking energy. He softly inhaled a mouthful of cold air. It was unexpected that such a thing was also present in this place.</p><p>The street was not long, only a couple of hundred meters. When Xiao Yan discovered that they had reached the end, he finally withdrew his eyes while feeling not fully satisfied. His face was stunned. Just this street alone had over ten things that he was interested in. Although Xiao Yan was interested in them, they were of little use to him. Hence, after some brief inquiries, Xiao Yan decided to give up exchanging for them. The value of the things that these old cunning fellows wanted to exchange for was not the least bit inferior to the things they were selling.</p><p>Xiao Yan softly sighed in a somewhat regretful manner. He had just pulled Cai Lin to a deeper part of the town when he discovered that she had suddenly stilled. He quickly became startled. He looked in the direction that she was staring. There was a seven-colored stone there. This stone was around the size of half a fist. There were seven extremely clear lines on it, and a special energy was vaguely radiating from it.</p><p>&#x201C;Seven-Colored Origin Stone?&#x201D;</p><p>Xiao Yan&#x2019;s brows slightly twitched. He quietly came to a sudden understanding when he recognized this thing. This so-called Seven-Colored Origin Stone was a mutated Spiritual Stone. It possessed a unique relationship with the Seven-Colored Heaven Swallowing Python. It was rumored that a Seven-Colored Origin Stone would hardly ever appeared at the spot where a Seven-Colored Heaven Swallowing Python died. A Seven-Colored Origin Stone had absorbed the blood of a Heaven Swallowing Python to create a unique energy. This energy served as nourishment to a Seven-Colored Heaven Swallowing Python. No wonder Cai Lin would stop because of it.</p><p>Xiao Yan slowly stepped forward. His eyes drifted to the back of the stone platform. A shriveled old man was sitting weakly at that spot. He did not greet Xiao Yan&#x2019;s group, which had stopped in front of the stone platform.</p><p>&#x201C;This elderly sir, may I know what you want in exchange for this Seven-Colored Origin Stone?&#x201D; Xiao Yan did not mind the old man&#x2019;s attitude as he faintly smiled and asked.</p><p>That skinny old man finally lifted his eyes after hearing Xiao Yan&#x2019;s words. He slowly said, &#x201C;Two tier 8 medicinal pills with at least three-colored Pill Lightning.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;It seems a little expensive, no?&#x201D; Xiao Yan&#x2019;s hand rubbed the Seven-Colored Origin Stone. This thing might be rare, but it was not that rare. More importantly, its value was limited. It was only useful to a Seven-Colored Heaven Swallowing Python. It was pointless for anyone else to obtain it. Hence, its value was not equivalent to two tier 8 medicinal pills with three or more colors of Pill Lightning.</p><p>Yao Lao crossed his hands and stood by the side. He did not interrupt. All he did was smiled as he watched Xiao Yan bargain with that skinny old man.</p><p>&#x201C;Don&#x2019;t exchange for it if you think it is expensive&#x2026;&#x201D; That skinny old man was full of character as he rolled his eyes. His tone did not treat Xiao Yan as a customer.</p><p>Xiao Yan could only roll his eyes, but he did not reach the stage where he was about to erupt in anger. If he did not even have this patience, he would not have been able to endure those bitter trainings.</p><p>While Xiao Yan planned to continue bargaining with the other party, Cai Lin by the side suddenly grabbed Xiao Yan&#x2019;s hand. Her somewhat cold but delicate finger gently wrote a word on Xiao Yan&#x2019;s palm. &#x201C;Buy!&#x201D;</p><p>Xiao Yan was slightly startled by Cai Lin. He understood that Cai Lin was not a foolish woman. Moreover, a Seven-Colored Origin Stone might be rare, but it was not something that she must have at all costs, yet she continued to insist. She had even secretly passed such a message to Xiao Yan. In which case, it was worth deliberating about this matter.</p><p>Although Xiao Yan had received Cai Lin&#x2019;s message, he did not immediately change his words. He continued to bargain with that skinny old man. Once Xiao Yan became a little irritated, he throw a jade bottle over and grabbed the Seven-Colored Origin Stone before turning around with Cai Lin to leave.</p><p>That skinny old man was startled when he saw Xiao Yan&#x2019;s agile trade. He grabbed the jade bottle in front of him and checked its content, feeling a little stunned. A moment later, he frowned and looked at the backs of Xiao Yan&#x2019;s group, which were disappearing in the distance. He felt that something was amiss in his heart without understanding why.</p><p>&#x201C;Damn it, has the old me identified it wrong? But that is obviously a Seven-Colored Origin Stone. What is with that fellow?&#x201D; The skinny old man muttered doubtfully. However, there was no one there to unravel his doubt.</p><p>After grabbing the Seven-Colored Origin Stone, Xiao Yan&#x2019;s group quickly disappeared from the old man&#x2019;s sight. Only after taking a turn did Xiao Yan halt. He handed the Seven-Colored Origin Stone to Cai Lin and asked, &#x201C;Is there something wrong with this stone?&#x201D;</p><p>Yao Lao and the Little Fairy Doctor by the side were surprised as they waited for Cai Lin to explain. They quickly examined the Seven-Colored Origin Stone but were unable to detect a difference.</p><p>&#x201C;Ugh&#x2026;&#x201D;</p><p>Cai Lin received the Seven-Colored Origin Stone. A smile surfaced on her cold face as she said, &#x201C;An ordinary person only knows that the place where a Seven-Colored Heaven Swallowing Python died has a chance of forming a Seven-Colored Origin Stone. However, they are unaware that if a hundred or more Seven-Colored Heaven Swallowing Python die in the same spot, there is a chance an eight-colored or even nine-colored Origin Stone will form, but it is basically impossible for a hundred Seven-Colored Heaven Swallowing Python to die at the same spot. Hence, an ordinary person is only aware of the Seven-Colored Origin Stone not the eight or nine color stones&#x2026;</p><p>&#x201C;The true peak of the Seven-Colored Heaven Swallowing Python is not known by this name. Instead, it is called the Nine-Colored Heaven Swallowing Python, but only those Heaven Swallowing Python ancestors with the richest bloodline will be able to reach that level. This is a memory that is inherited from the bloodline of the Heaven Swallowing Python. An ordinary person, even people like you, do not know this.&#x201D;</p><p>Upon hearing these words, not only was Xiao Yan surprised, even Yao Lao was a little stunned. Clearly, they had never heard of this secret.</p><p>&#x201C;No wonder only you can recognize it&#x2026;&#x201D; Xiao Yan bitterly smiled and shook his head. He curiously asked, &#x201C;In that case, is this Origin Stone eight or nine colors?&#x201D;</p><p>Cai Lin&#x2019;s fingernail cut her finger. A drop of blood landed on the Origin Stone. One could see a slowly wiggling line appear behind the seventh line on the smooth surface of the rock&#x2026;</p><p>&#x201C;In order to see just how many colors this Origin Stone has, one must use the blood of a Seven-Colored Heaven Swallowing Python&#x2026;&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Eight-Colored Origin Stone&#x2026;&#x201D;</p><p>Xiao Yan felt a little pity when he saw this. If this was a Nine-Colored Origin Stone, Cai Lin would have gained a lot this time around. Of course, he was aware that this was his own greed. Eight colors was already not bad. If it was used properly, it would significantly increase Cai Lin&#x2019;s strength. The eight-colored stone might be different than the seven-colored stone by a color, but the energy that was contained in them was vastly different.</p><p>&#x201C;Hee, if that old fellow was aware of this, it is likely that he would spit out a mouthful of blood&#x2026;&#x201D; Yao Lao smiled. It was unexpected that they would find such a gain after having just arrived at the spatial trade fair.</p><p>&#x201C;Let&#x2019;s go, I will bring all of you to see a true treasure. The thing that we need is also there&#x2026;&#x201D;</p><p>Yao Lao waved his hand. After which, he turned his body and walked to one side of the street. Xiao Yan and the Little Fairy Doctor quickly followed. Finally, Cai Lin rubbed the Eight-Colored Origin Stone in her hand before she put it into her Storage Ring. She did not discover the extremely tiny line that quietly appeared behind the eighth line when she put the Origin Stone&#x2026;</p>
