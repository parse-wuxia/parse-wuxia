<p><strong><u>Chapter 347: The Appearance of The Seven-Colored Heaven Swallowing Python</u></strong></p><p>Just as Yun Leng was about to capture Xiao Yan in the distant sky, the latter&#x2019;s sleeve abruptly trembled. Immediately, a thick and large shadow shot forth. It instantly swung violently on Yun Leng&#x2019;s hand with a terrifying strength that actually shook the air until waves of sharp explosive sounds were emitted from the vibrations.</p><p>At the moment when the seven-colored figure appeared, Yun Leng also sensed something. His face immediately changed wildly, but before he could hurriedly pull himself back, that seven-colored figure had already swung heavily at his hand. A flush instantly surged onto Yu Leng&#x2019;s face and numerous soft muffled groans were spat from his throat. His body was like a rubber ball that had been sent flying as it was swiftly forced back.</p><p>The sudden change in situation in the sky directly caused Hai Bodong and those three Misty Cloud Sect&#x2019;s elders presently fighting in the square to involuntarily cease their attacks. Their gazes were stunned as they watched the direction which Xiao Yan was in. It was a little better for Hai Bodong, but those who were unfamiliar with Xiao Yan were so shocked that their jaws nearly fell. In the Misty Cloud Sect, other than Yun Yun, there were few others who could defeat Yun Leng, given his strength. However, the him earlier was actually forced back by Xiao Yan who was at the Da Dou Shi class?</p><p>&#x201C;What was that thing just now?&#x201D; Jia Xing Tian&#x2019;s mouth widened as he stood in the huge tree. His face was a little serious and at a loss as he asked. Due to the terrifying speed at which the shadow attacked, he could not see it clearly even with the abilities of his eyes. He could only vaguely sense that something appeared which shot out from Xiao Yan&#x2019;s sleeve. That Yun Leng was forced back by that thing.</p><p>&#x201C;It appeared to be a tail.&#x201D; Fa Ma hesitated for a moment and said in an uncertain manner.</p><p>&#x201C;Tail?&#x201D; Hearing this, Jia Xing Tian was stunned. He frowned intently while staring at Xiao Yan in the sky, &#x201C;It is another trump card that was never revealed? Don&#x2019;t tell me that this fellow is really that mysterious strong person who killed Mo Cheng?&#x201D;</p><p>In the face of Xiao Yan revealing trump cards which were increasingly shocking, Jia Xing Tian&#x2019;s heart also began to shake. The gaze which he used to look at Xiao Yan in midair began to have something more to it.</p><p>&#x201C;Brat, what is that in your sleeve?&#x201D; Yun Leng, who was forced back by tens of meters in the sky finally got rid of the terrifying force which had been transmitted to his palm. His lowered hand trembled slightly as he cried out loud while eyeing the distant Xiao Yan with an ugly expression.</p><p>The sudden turn of events also caused Xiao Yan to be startled. Quickly following this, however, he appeared to have understood something. A wild joy swiftly surfaced on his face. Before he spoke, his sleeve moved agitatedly and a seven-colored shadow shot out. As a clear hissing sound was emitted, a small seven-colored snake began to happily wander around Xiao Yan&#x2019;s body. The sunlight shone onto its small body, reflecting a seven-colored glow. At a glance, it appeared very beautiful.</p><p>The small seven-colored snake was naturally the &#x2018;Seven-Colored Heaven Swallowing Python&#x2019; which had been in a deep slumber. It was really unexpected that this little fellow had actually awakened when Xiao Yan was at his most pressing moment, helping him avoid disaster.</p><p>After the &#x2018;Seven-Colored Heaven Swallowing Python&#x2019; appeared, the expression of Yun Leng, who had been staring at this spot, became gloomy. It was likely that he had recognized that the thing which had forced him back a moment ago was this beautiful thing which appeared completely harmless.</p><p>&#x201C;A rank five Magical Beast. I didn&#x2019;t expect that you were hiding such a thing.&#x201D; Yun Leng twisted his wrist which was numb from the shock of the huge force, as he said with a cold smile.</p><p>Xiao Yan glanced at him, but chose to ignore his words. His hand gently rubbed the body of the &#x2018;Seven-Colored Heaven Swallowing Python&#x2019; whose body was as cool as jade. As he watched the pair of snake eyes which faintly had a flirtatious feeling to them, his heart trembled involuntarily. This little thing increasingly appeared to have a presence similar to Queen Medusa. Did the spirits of the two finally begin to merge?</p><p>Xiao Yan&#x2019;s rubbing caused the &#x2018;Seven-Colored Heaven Swallowing Python&#x2019; to seem extremely satisfied. It repeatedly used its small head to press against the former&#x2019;s palm. Its snake tongue repeatedly licked at the storage ring on Xiao Yan&#x2019;s hand. A covetous look, which Xiao Yan was familiar with, once again appeared in those coquettish snake eyes.</p><p>When he discovered the greedy action of it, Xiao Yan quietly sighed in relief within his heart. He flicked his finger and a bottle of &#x2018;Amethyst Lion Birth Essence&#x2019; appeared in his palm. His finger was extended into it and gently poked, allowing two drops to stick onto it. After which, he carefully allowed the &#x2018;Seven-Colored Heaven Swallowing Python&#x2019; to lick it clean.</p><p>After eating two drops of delicious &#x2018;Amethyst Lion Birth Essence&#x2019;, the &#x2018;Seven-Colored Heaven Swallowing Python&#x2019; closed its snake eyes and sensed the warm feeling emitted as the hot energy flowed within its body.</p><p>&#x201C;Hei, little thing, you need to work after eating.&#x201D; Xiao Yan&#x2019;s finger gently tapped the &#x2018;Seven-Colored Heaven Swallowing Python&#x2019;s&#x2019; head. His smiling manner was like a wicked uncle who was tempting an underage girl into do something wrong.</p><p>&#x201C;If you defeat him, I will give you more of this. What do you say?&#x201D; Xiao Yan shook the &#x2018;Amethyst Lion Birth Essence&#x2019; in front of the &#x2018;Seven-Colored Heaven Swallowing Python&#x2019; before immediately pointing toward Yun Leng in front of him and smiled as he said.</p><p>Perhaps it was due to Queen Medusa, but during this period of time, Xiao Yan could sense that the strength of this &#x2018;Seven-Colored Heaven Swallowing Python&#x2019; was growing increasingly strong despite this little thing being in a deep slumber. The strength which it had displayed when forcing Yun Leng back would not be weaker than a rank 5 Magical Beast. If that was translated to the classification of humans, it would be equivalent to a Dou Wang.</p><p>At this current moment, a helper who could contend with a Dou Wang was undoubtedly blessing sent by heaven for Xiao Yan, who had been chased until he was badly battered.</p><p>When it heard Xiao Yan&#x2019;s words, the &#x2018;Seven-Colored Heaven Swallowing Python&#x2019; widened its eyes and considered it for a moment. With its current intelligence it could naturally understand the meaning of Xiao Yan&#x2019;s words. After a brief hesitation, it finally could not resist the temptation of the &#x2018;Amethyst Lion Birth Essence&#x2019;, It shook its tail, turned around, and stared at the distant Yun Leng with its snake eyes. The seven-colored glow on its body abruptly soared. As the glow bloomed, the body of the &#x2018;Seven-Colored Heaven Swallowing Python&#x2019; actually became like a balloon which had air blown into as it swiftly became larger.</p><p>In front of the countless number of shocked eyes in the square, the &#x2018;Seven-Colored Heaven Swallowing Python&#x2019;, which was originally only a foot long, had turned into a huge being that was tens of feet long in just an instant.</p><p>The seven-colored huge snake floated in the air. Its snake scales reflected a seven-colored glow. If it&#x2019;s snake body possessed claws at this moment, it would be similar to a living dragon.</p><p>Following its body being enlarged, a powerful energy also slowly overflowed from within the body of the &#x2018;Seven-Colored Heaven Swallowing Python&#x2019;, causing the surrounding air to form a ripple much like a water wave.</p><p>The huge snake lingered in the sky. Its enormous body was something that stunned not only the people below, but even Xiao Yan himself. He did not expect that this little thing which had always been of small pocket sized being was actually able to transform into such an appearance which was extremely eye piercing.</p><p>The &#x2018;Seven-Colored Heaven Swallowing Python&#x2019; which had suddenly turned huge also caused Yun Leng to inhale a breath of cold air. His expression gradually became grave. Turning his head toward the battleground of Hai Bodong and the few others, he shouted, &#x201C;Yun Li, the few of you should temporarily stop Hai Bodong. Leave this thing to me! All the Misty Cloud Sect&#x2019;s deacons, think of ways to capture Xiao Yan!&#x201D;</p><p>After having come into contact with it earlier, Yun Leng had managed to vaguely estimate the &#x2018;Seven-Colored Heaven Swallowing Python&#x2019;s&#x2019; strength. Although the latter could also be considered a rank five Magical Beast, Yun Leng had quite a lot of confidence if they were to really start fighting. The high class Dou Techniques which he had trained with were sufficient enough to cause this strange Magical Beast of unknown origin to suffer greatly.</p><p>&#x201C;Hey, it is really unexpected that Xiao Yan was actually still hiding such a high rank pet. I actually didn&#x2019;t even know of it&#x2019;s existence.&#x201D; Hai Bodong could not resist smacking his lips and praising as his shocked gaze slowly moved away from the &#x2018;Seven-Colored Heaven Swallowing Python&#x2019;s&#x2019; body.</p><p>&#x201C;Yun Leng, today, you better not lose unexpectedly in front of the younger generation. Otherwise, you will really lose a lot of face.&#x201D; Hai Bodong laughed out loud as his gaze once again turned toward the serious looking Yun Leng. Immediately, he flapped that icy cold pair of wings on his back and charged violently toward the three Misty Cloud Sect&#x2019;s Elders who were solemnly waiting. He laughed coldly, &#x201C;Hee hee, since I don&#x2019;t have to worry about the situation there, let me completely try and see whether your merging Dou Techniques is stronger than the icy cold Dou Qi of this old man.&#x201D;</p><p>The corner of Yun Leng&#x2019;s eyes drifted toward Hai Bodong and the others who had once again started fighting like rocks colliding against each other. His gaze then swiftly turned toward the distant spot where the &#x2018;Seven-Colored Heaven Swallowing Python&#x2019; was located. His expression was serious and his hands were slowly extended out of his sleeves. A somewhat grayish white Dou Qi gradually appeared and finally covered his entire arm. At one glance, it appeared like a rock arm with an extremely great hardness.</p><p>&#x201C;Hiss hiss.&#x201D;</p><p>The forked snake tongue quietly extended and pulled back. After turning into a huge body, those snake eyes of the &#x2018;Seven-Colored Heaven Swallowing Python&#x2019;, which originally appeared somewhat bewitching, finally had some additional ferocity that was part of its nature. Poisonous fangs crossed each other within its huge mouth, emitting a thick cold glow.</p><p>Two strong presences in the sky were slowly being spread out from the human and the beast. Adding in the powerful force that was being emitted from the battleground where Hai Bodong was at, the faces of the Misty Cloud Sect disciples on the entire open ground twitched involuntarily. Who would have thought that in order to capture a little fellow who was merely of the Da Dou Shi class, they would end up provoking a strong Dou Huang and a rank five Magical Beast which was able to contend with a Dou Wang?</p><p>As he watched the person and the beast who had began to emit pressure with their presence, Xiao Yan flapped the pair of wings on his back and hurriedly retreated some distance. His heart also quietly sighed in relief. The appearance of the &#x2018;Seven-Colored Heaven Swallowing Python&#x2019; had really settled his predicament. From the looks of the situation now, the Misty Cloud Sect should no longer have any more Dou Wangs within it. In that case, as long as he carefully controlled his flying height, the strength of those deacons should not be able to capture him. When that time came, all he needed to do was to wait for Hai Bodong to finish off those three Misty Cloud Sect&#x2019;s Elders and he could completely extricate himself from this predicament today.</p><p>In the sky, a human and a beast faced each other from afar. Their imposing presence placed pressure on people, much like an imminent storm.</p><p>At a certain moment, the imposing presences which were spread all over became stagnant. Yun Leng&#x2019;s hands opened and closed and a large, gray-colored energy sword was extended out from his palm. The wings on his back were flapped and his body cut through the empty air, leaving behind a long scar in the sky.</p><p>At the moment Yun Leng&#x2019;s body moved, the &#x2018;Seven-Colored Heaven Swallowing Python&#x2019; also abruptly raised its head. It let out a clear hiss and its huge body displayed a terrifying speed, which shocked everyone.</p><p>A human and a beast cut through the long space and an instant later, collided with each other in front of everyone&#x2019;s eyes!</p>
