<p><strong><u>Chapter 1520: Final Reward</u></strong></p><p>&#x201C;Purifying Demonic Lotus Flame&#x2026;&#x201D;</p><p>Xiao Yan only suppressed the excitement in his heart while he stood in the sky. He exchanged glances with Xun Er. Only then did he carefully descend. He slowly came to a halt when he was around a couple dozen feet from the cream-white and pink fire lotus.</p><p>The current Purifying Demonic Lotus Flame was completely different than the one from earlier. The Purifying Demonic Lotus Flame was extremely violent while this one was peaceful and calm. It did not unleash an attack when Xiao Yan and Xun Er approached.</p><p>&#x201C;The Purifying Demonic Lotus Flame seems to be a little different than earlier&#x2026;&#x201D; Xun Er finally stated in a somewhat surprised voice after watching the fire lotus quietly float around.</p><p>&#x201C;The Purifying Demonic Lotus Saint has removed all of its old memories and intelligence. The current Purifying Demonic Lotus Flame is just like a baby who has just been born.&#x201D; Xiao Yan&#x2019;s face was filled with a heated expression. After having witnessed the brutal character of the Purifying Demonic Lotus Flame, he would not dare to refine it even after obtaining it. After all, even an ultimate expert as strong as the Purifying Demonic Lotus Saint had ended up dying because of the retaliation of the demonic flame. Even less needed to be said about a mere two star Dou Sheng like him.</p><p>However, such worry had completely vanished now. The Purifying Demonic Lotus Saint&#x2019;s remnant image and the Purifying Demonic Lotus Flame had vanished from the world. Only the pure baby-like demonic flame essence remained behind and it no longer possessed any violence like it did earlier.</p><p>&#x201C;Would doing this not end up damaging the spirituality of the Purifying Demonic Lotus Flame?&#x201D; Xun Er frowned and asked. The reason natural Heavenly Flames were unique was because they possessed a spirituality that an ordinary flame did not possess. If this spirituality had vanished, the Heavenly Flame would not longer possess that dazzling allure.</p><p>&#x201C;Given the Purifying Demonic Lotus Saint&#x2019;s skill, do you think that he would do something so foolish? This Purifying Demonic Lotus Flame is still filled with spirituality. However, some of the things that did not originally belong to it were snatched away by the Purifying Demonic Lotus Saint&#x2026;&#x201D; Xiao Yan shook his head and said. &#x201C;Currently, it appears as pure as it did when had just appeared in this world. It has not been influenced or contaminated by people&#x2026;&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Looks like this Purifying Demonic Lotus Saint has been a great help to us.&#x201D; Xun Er covered her mouth and softly laughed. This operation of theirs was about to end in failure, but the Purifying Demonic Lotus Saint had appeared halfway through and forcefully stripped the various negative emotions away from the Purifying Demonic Lotus Flame. This allowed them to taste some hope.</p><p>&#x201C;What should we do now? The spatial tunnel has already vanished. I gave it a try earlier, and I&#x2019;m afraid that given our current strength, we are unable to tear open the space here&#x2026;&#x201D; Xun Er hesitated before she once again spoke. Although both of them were elite two star Dou Shengs, this realm had been created by the Purifying Demonic Lotus Saint. There were still some seals existing in this realm, so it was not easy to tear through this space&#x2026;</p><p>Xiao Yan fondled his chin. His eyes returned to the fire lotus on the surface of the magma and laughed, &#x201C;Since we are temporarily unable to leave, I should refine the Purifying Demonic Lotus Flame here&#x2026;&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Are you confident?&#x201D; Xun Er knit her brows. Although the Purifying Demonic Lotus Flame had ceased randomly attacking, it was a terrifying existence ranked third on the Heavenly Flame Ranking regardless of how one put it. It would not be easy to refine.</p><p>&#x201C;Less than fifty percent&#x2026;&#x201D; Xiao Yan faintly smiled but did not hide anything. After having witnessed the might of the Purifying Demonic Lotus Flame, a fear had formed for this demonic flame. Moreover, there was definitely less than five people around the entire world who were absolutely sure that they could refine the Purifying Demonic Lotus Flame. Hence, how could he pat his chest and guarantee that he could?</p><p>A worry flashed through Xun Er&#x2019;s eyes after hearing his low chances.</p><p>&#x201C;There is no choice. If we bring the demonic flame essence out, countless of people will be tempted by it. At that time, even if I follow you to the Gu clan to hide, it will still bring trouble to the Sky Mansion Alliance. This demonic flame realm was personally created by the Purifying Demonic Lotus Flame. I think that even your father will not be able to barge in so easily. Otherwise, I&#x2019;m afraid that he would have already intervened and snatched away the demonic flame. Hence, we are safe in this realm. I will only be able to refine the Purifying Demonic Lotus Flame without being distracted here!&#x201D; Xiao Yan smiled and said. &#x201C;Other people might think that we have met with mishap if we remain here without leaving for a long time, but this will save a ton of trouble. Zi Yan and I have a dragon seal as a connection so there isn&#x2019;t too much to worry about on teacher&#x2019;s side.&#x201D;</p><p>Xun Er mused for a moment after hearing Xiao Yan&#x2019;s words. She could only nod her head in the end. What Xiao Yan had said was reasonable. Currently, there were many people within the central plains who had cast their eyes to the demonic flame realm. If other people discovered them taking the demonic flame essence out, even the might of the Gu clan would not be able to suppress the greed in those people&#x2019;s hearts, which means they would attack without care. At that time, they would end up in an endless amount of trouble even if they could deal with them. Moreover, there was the Hun clan watching with ill-intent by the side. There would be no time to quietly refine the demonic flame.</p><p>&#x201C;In that case, when do you plan to act?&#x201D; Xun Er&#x2019;s eyes softly rolled as she asked what he was planning to do.</p><p>&#x201C;Ha ha, there is no hurry to refine it now. We still have some time. Refining the Purifying Demonic Lotus Flame is not a simple matter. I must prepare some things&#x2026;&#x201D; Xiao Yan smiled and shook his head. His eyes became heated when he looked at the demonic flame lotus floating on the magma. He had thought that refining the Purifying Demonic Lotus Flame would not be difficult after reaching the Dou Sheng class, but the battle from earlier had allowed him to understand that if he did not prepare some things, the one who would end up being refined would be called into question.</p><p>The spatial distortion had completely vanished outside of the demonic flame realm. The terrifyingly high temperature that originally covered the land had gradually weakened. The magma desert below had ceased churning before it gradually solidified into many white rocks&#x2026;</p><p>Many figures were suspended in the surrounding sky. Their eyes were filled with an unwillingness as they stared back at the spatial tunnel. After the spatial tunnel scattered, they lost contact with that magma realm. Regardless of what kind of technique they unleashed, they could not make the realm to reappear.</p><p>&#x201C;Why is it that Xiao Yan and Xun Er are still not out?&#x201D; Ancestor Huo Yun stared at the sky with a grave expression. There had not been the slightest activity ever since they had escaped.</p><p>&#x201C;Young miss&#x2026;&#x201D; Gu Nanhai anxiously stared at the sky. Cold sweat covered his forehead. Xun Er&#x2019;s position in the Gu clan was extraordinary, but he had lost her. There was no telling how he would be reprimanded after returning to the Gu clan.</p><p>&#x201C;Elder, there is no need to blame yourself. Xun Er insisted on accompanying Xiao Yan. It is pointless even if you managed to react in time back then.&#x201D; Gu Qing Yang softly sighed. He also had not expected Xun Er to take such a big risk and remain in that magma realm with Xiao Yan.</p><p>&#x201C;Xiao Yan is extremely blessed. Nothing will happen to Xun Er either.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;What if something did?&#x201D; Gu Nanhai grit his teeth and asked. Even an expert like him could not remain in the demonic flame realm for long. Even less needed to be said about Xiao Yan and Xun Er.</p><p>&#x201C;Let&#x2019;s wait&#x2026;&#x201D; Yao Lao by the side sighed. It was pointless to say anything at this moment. The demonic flame realm had shut, and they were unable to enter it again. Hence, the only thing they could do was wait.</p><p>The remaining individuals quietly nodded after hearing Yao Lao&#x2019;s words.</p><p>&#x201C;Hee, the Gu clan seems to have suffered a great loss this time around. That Xun Er has an extraordinary talent. If she was given enough time, she probably would have become extremely terrifying. Although we did not manage to obtain the Purifying Demonic Lotus Flame, we have finished off two potential threats.&#x201D; The deputy hall chief a short distance away glanced at the Yao Lao&#x2019;s worried group while laughing in a strange low voice.</p><p>&#x201C;Xiao Yan has the remnant image of the Purifying Demonic Lotus Saint on him. There is no telling if an accident will occur&#x2026;&#x201D; The chief of the Hall of Souls merely frowned as he replied.</p><p>&#x201C;Xiao Yan is full of tricks. He does not appear to be someone with a short life.&#x201D; Hun Feng slowly commented.</p><p>&#x201C;We will wait a few days here. I want to see just what kind of tricks two juniors can pull!&#x201D; Old Man Hun Mo&#x2019;s eyes flickered slightly as he spoke in a low and deep voice.</p><p>The three remaining individuals nodded after hearing him speak. They did not add anything more.</p><p>Most of the people did not leave once the demonic flame realm closed. Instead, they chose to remain in the sky outside. Most people were unwilling to make a wasted trip, so they wanted to wait and see if any unexpected changes occurred.</p><p>Seven days passed in the blink of an eye as everyone waited. Not the slightest activity happened in this place during these seven days, not even the slightest heat was emitted. This caused many people to feel disappointed. Some people remained unsatisfied and left amid this disappointment.</p><p>&#x201C;It has been seven days&#x2026;&#x201D;</p><p>Gu Qing Yang bitterly laughed. He looked at Gu Nanhai in front of him, whose face seemed to have aged. He hesitated for a moment before asking, &#x201C;Elder, what is it?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;I don&#x2019;t know&#x2026;&#x201D; Gu Nanhai shook his head. His voice was a little hoarse.</p><p>Yao Lao&#x2019;s expression by the side revealed his fatigue. He was just about to speak when the space in front of him fluctuated. Zi Yan&#x2019;s figure appeared in a flash, but she shook her head after appearing and said, &#x201C;I am unable to find the demonic flame realm. There is a seal placed on this realm and I am unable to detect its location.&#x201D;</p><p>The expressions of Yao Lao&#x2019;s group appeared dark upon hearing this information.</p><p>&#x201C;However, Xiao Yan should be fine. The dragon seal will disappear if something happens to him.&#x201D; Zi Yan extended her hand. There was a pale-golden dragon seal on her palm. She turned her head to Gu Nanhai and smiled as she said, &#x201C;Elder Gu also need not be worried. Xiao Yan and older sister Xun Er are together. Given his character, he will definitely not allow anything to happen to her. He would also go crazy if anything happens to her, and if that happened, the dragon seal would not be this calm&#x2026;&#x201D;</p><p>Some life finally appeared on Gu Nanhai&#x2019;s face after he heard her words. He lifted his head and glanced at Yao Lao before sighing, &#x201C;Regardless of what the case is, this matter has already happened. I will need to return to the Gu clan to report on this matter&#x2026;&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;You can rest assured that I will dispatch people to constantly monitor this place. I will inform the Gu clan of any activity!&#x201D; Yao Lao replied in a deep voice.</p><p>&#x201C;In that case, I will thank you&#x2026;&#x201D; Gu Nanhai forcefully braced his attention. He cupped his hands to Yao Lao before staring deeply at distant space. Only then did he turn around and fly to the northern sky. Gu Qing Yang hurriedly followed behind him.</p><p>Yao Lao&#x2019;s group exchanged glances with each other seeing those two leave. They quietly sighed&#x2026;</p><p>While everyone was gradually scattering outside of the demonic flame realm, Xiao Yan, who had prepared for seven days inside the realm, slowly opened his eyes. He was finally going to start refining the Purifying Demonic Lotus Flame.</p><p>He had waited over a decade for this day!</p>
