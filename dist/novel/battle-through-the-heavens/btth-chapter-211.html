<p><strong><u>Chapter 211: Pill-King Gu He&#x2019;s Generous Offer!</u></strong></p><p>Eyeing Queen Medusa who had appeared in the sky, Gu He and Yan Shi, the one who spoke with a thunder like voice, involuntarily took a quiet step closer to the silent black-robed person. In this place, she was the only one who could match Queen Medusa, whose fierce reputation was feared throughout the Jia Ma Empire.</p><p>&#x201C;You are looking for me?&#x201D; In the sky, Queen Medusa lowered her head and looked at Gu He. A delicate and narrow angle was formed as she lifted her red lips. In that instant, her exquisite appearance was complemented by a bewitching aura. Her frown and her smile caused the Dou Lings around Gu He to instantly become absent minded.</p><p>Under the smiling gaze of Queen Medusa, Gu He took in a gentle breath and suppressed the emotion in his heart. He lifted his head and smiled, &#x201C;Queen Medusa, Your Majesty, I am honored to meet you. I am Gu He of the Jia Ma Empire.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Pill-King Gu He. I&#x2019;ve heard of you. A tier six alchemist is really extraordinary. You actually even managed to request the help of a Dou Huang.&#x201D; Queen Medusa eyes swept across the mysterious black-robed person at one side as she said with a smile.</p><p>&#x201C;Tell me, why are you here to look for me? Although your forceful entrance into the territory of my race is extremely rude, our Snake-People race is not a race that is unreasonable.&#x201D; Watching Gu He who appeared to quietly sigh in relief, a cunning glint flashed across Queen Medusa&#x2019;s limpid eyes. She said softly, &#x201C;Moreover, Pill-King Gu He&#x2019;s reputation as an alchemist is renowned throughout the Jia Ma Empire. When the time comes, you can randomly pledge something to repay these little losses. Am I right, Grandmaster Gu He?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Uh&#x2026;&#x201D; The smile on Gu He&#x2019;s face was a little embarrassed. However, Gu He was also someone who had a wide experience. He immediately had the magnanimity to be a sucker, proudly waved his head and smilingly said, &#x201C;It is indeed rude of us to forcefully enter into the territory of your race. These losses would be compensated byme.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Ge ge, Grandmaster Gu He is really open-minded.&#x201D; Queen Medusa touched her red lips and softly laughed. She blinked her long eyelashes and said with a soft laugh, &#x201C;Grandmaster, why don&#x2019;t you tell us the reason for you to invite so many friends and spend so much effort to arrive at the territory of our Snake-People race.&#x201D;</p><p>Hearing that the conversation was gradually moving into the main subject, a seriousness surfaced on Gu He&#x2019;s face. He was quiet for a moment as he considered his words. The laughing manner of Queen Medusa in front of him may have caused her to appear to be harmless, but he was extremely clear that this bewitching beautiful woman had turned three Dou Ling into meat pies that filled the sky when the Snake-People and the Jia Ma Empire were at war back then. Her vicious means were enough to chill those people who frequently licked the blood off their blades. Moreover, Gu He also knew that Queen Medusa&#x2019;s strength was among the top of those at the Dou Huang level. If not for the Jia Ma Empire having three Dou Huangs, the war might have gone differently.</p><p>Even though he had the mysterious black-robed person whom he invited by his side, Gu He clearly understood that he did not invite her to fight with Queen Medusa. She was the only one who could block Queen Medusa if the latter have any killing intent and able to prevent the people around him from being killed by Queen Medusa.</p><p>Gu He let out his breath slowly and raised his head. He eyed Queen Medusa in the air and said in a low voice, &#x201C;The purpose of my travelling here is the &#x2018;Heavenly Flame&#x2019; that Your Majesty obtained!&#x201D;</p><p>Gu He&#x2019;s deep voice gradually reverberated through the sky, causing the originally calm surroundings to suddenly become much quieter.</p><p>&#x201C;Hu&#x2026; this guy has also come here because of the &#x2018;Green Lotus Core Flame&#x2019;.&#x201D; Within the pile of rocks below, Xiao Yan gently sighed and softly said with a bitter smile.</p><p>&#x201C;&#x2018;Heavenly Flame&#x2019;? When has Her Majesty obtained something like a &#x2018;Heavenly Flame&#x2019;?&#x201D; Hearing Gu He&#x2019;s words, The faces of Mo Basi and Yue Mei on the city wall were stunned. Clearly, they did not know about Queen Medusa obtaining the &#x2018;Green Lotus Core Flame&#x2019; from outside of Rock Desert City half a year ago.</p><p>&#x201C;For what purpose did Queen Medusa obtain the &#x2018;Heavenly Flame&#x2019; for?&#x201D; Yue Mei was at a loss as they blinked their eyes. A moment later, she appeared to have remembered something. Her expression changed drastically as she suddenly turned around and exchanged a glance with Mo Basi. She said in a soft shocked voice, &#x201C;Don&#x2019;t tell me it&#x2019;s&#x2026;&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Should be. Otherwise Queen Medusa would not spend so much effort to search for the &#x2018;Heavenly Flame&#x2019;. Besides planning to do that thing, there should not be any other intention.&#x201D; Mo Basi softly said after taking in a gentle breath.</p><p>&#x201C;But&#x2026; god. The chances of failure of that thing are extremely high! Once any accident happens to Her Majesty, then our Snake-People race&#x2026;&#x201D; Yue Mei&#x2019;s hands waved randomly in front of her as she said with a bitter smile.</p><p>&#x201C;Ugh&#x2026; Her Majesty has been at the Dou Huang level for many years. Perhaps she&#x2019;s feeling a little impatient. Although she usually appears to be not too concerned about these things, I know very well that she wants to become stronger. Once she becomes a Dou Zong, the strength of our Snake-People race would also swiftly increase. In the future, we would not need to be trapped in this never ending desert. We may have adapted to it over so many years but this isn&#x2019;t the place for us Snake-People. Our blood is cold after all.&#x201D; Mo Ba Si gently sighed.</p><p>Yue Mei also gently sighed. She raised her head and shifted her bitterly smiling eyes toward Queen Medusa in midair whose smile on her pretty face was gradually transforming into one of indifference.</p><p>&#x201C;&#x2018;Heavenly Flame&#x2019;? How did you obtain news of me obtaining a &#x2018;Heavenly Flame&#x2019;?&#x201D; Queen Medusa&#x2019;s delicate finger smoothed over the fallen black hair in front of her forehead. Her slightly purple-colored pretty eyes flashed with a little iciness.</p><p>&#x201C;Half a year ago, I was also in the desert searching for a medicinal ingredient and coincidentally sensed the presence of the &#x2018;Heavenly Flame&#x2019;. I chased after it. Although I did not discover Your Majesty&#x2019;s figure, I picked up a few pieces of seven-colored snake scales with blood on them&#x2026; Seven-colored snake scales are strange scales that would only appear on Your Majesty&#x2019;s body when you use your full strength to fight. On those snake scales, I also sensed the scent of a &#x2018;Heavenly Flame&#x2019;. I&#x2019;m guessing that Your Majesty was hurt by the &#x2018;Heavenly Flame&#x2019; when you took it away.&#x201D; Gu He said softly.</p><p>Queen Medusa gently licked her moist red lips. Her pair of strange pupils with a faint coldness lingering in it was intently focused on Gu He.</p><p>Seemingly sensing the ill intention in Queen Medusa&#x2019;s eyes, Gu He carefully retreated behind the black-robed person. He smiled bitterly and said, &#x201C;Your Majesty, I do not have any other intention. I think Your Majesty should be extremely clear of how important a &#x2018;Heavenly Flame&#x2019; is to an alchemist. In order to obtain a &#x2018;Heavenly Flame&#x2019;, I have visited many different strange places in the Jia Ma Empire&#x2026; The blood of the Snake-People is cold. The &#x2018;Heavenly Flame&#x2019; does not bring you much benefit. Therefore, I hope that Your Majesty would allow me to use other things to exchange for the &#x2018;Heavenly Flame&#x2019; in your hands.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Exchange?&#x201D; Hearing this, Queen Medusa lifted the corner of her eyes in mockery. She laughed faintly, &#x201C;Since you are an alchemist, you should be more clear of the strength of a &#x2018;Heavenly Flame&#x2019; compared to me. You tell me, what kind of things do you need to take out in order to match the value of it?&#x201D;</p><p>Gu He frowned slightly and mused for awhile. A rare painful expression appeared on his face. He then raised his head and said in a deep voice, &#x201C;I am willing to use two tier six &#x2018;Fighting Spirit Pills&#x2019;... and a tier seven &#x2018;Body Transformation Pill&#x2019; to exchange for the &#x2018;Heavenly Flame&#x2019;! What does Your Majesty think?&#x201D;</p><p>When Gu He&#x2019;s words escaped his mouth, the surrounding Yan Shi and the others widened their eyes and looked at Gu He with stunned faces. Even the black-robed person beside him also tilted her head over and a dumbfounded gaze shot out from under it. It was clear that even she did not expect that Gu He would be so generous because of the &#x2018;Heavenly Flame&#x2019;.</p><p>A tier six &#x2018;Dou Ling Pill&#x2019; was a medicinal pill that was sufficient to cause any Dou Wang to covet over it. The effect of this type of medicinal pill was simple but caused others to be envious. Its effect was to enable a Dou Wang level person who consumed it to raise their strength by one star!</p><p>In other words, if a two star Dou Wang was to consume a &#x2018;Fighting Spirit Pill&#x2019;, they would be able to leap to a three star Dou Wang in a mere few days! It should be known that when one reaches the Dou Wang level, the gaps between each star are extremely large. Many Dou Wangs remain stagnant at the same star after training hard for a few years. From this, it can be seen just how precious a &#x2018;Fighting Spirit Pill&#x2019; was.</p><p>A &#x201C;Fighting Spirit Pill&#x201D;&#x2019;s effect may be something that people coveted but for those that have taken it once, they gain an extremely high immunity to it. As long as a person had consumed one pill, a second &#x2018;Fighting Spirit Pill&#x2019; had basically lost its effect. In other words, a Dou Wang can only use one &#x2018;Fighting Spirit Pill&#x2019; in their lifetime.</p><p>Even though this was so, the &#x2018;Fighting Spirit Pill&#x2019; remained one of the most coveted medicine among the strong. Many people were willing to pay an enormous price in order to obtain a &#x2018;Fighting Spirit Pill&#x2019;!</p><p>Compared to the tier six &#x2018;Fighting Spirit Pill&#x2019;, the tier seven &#x2018;Body Transformation Pill&#x2019;... was something that caused people to feel shocked.</p><p>This medicinal pill was sufficient to cause countless Dou Huang level Magic Beasts to go wild over it. This was because as long as they had this medicinal pill, they would be able to entirely break away from their beast body and from then on possess the lifespan of a Magic Beast and the training talent of a human. The beast that had the superposition of these two special abilities may well have the potential to become a Dou Zhong or even a Dou Sheng level being!</p><p>The two things that Gu He took out seemed to have reached the stage where some people would go crazy over. No wonder the nearby Yan Shi and the others felt a sense of disbelief.</p><p>&#x201C;Dammit&#x2026; this guy, isn&#x2019;t he too generous?&#x201D; From the pile of rocks, Xiao Yan was stunned as he gazed at Gu He in the sky. A long while later, he gradually recovered and mumbled in his heart, &#x201C;He really lives up to being the number one person among the Jia Ma Empire&#x2019;s Alchemists. He even possess such a rare and valuable &#x2018;Body Transformation Pill&#x2019;. Looks like he really intends to obtain the &#x2018;Heavenly Flame&#x2019;.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;He is indeed very generous. However, with his current alchemy level, he has an extremely low chance of successfully refining the &#x2018;Fighting Spirit Pill&#x2019;. As for that &#x2018;Body Transformation Pill&#x2019;, it would be impossible for him to refine it.&#x201D; Yao Lao sighed emotionally before he said with some disdain. Back then, he had personally refined the &#x2018;Body Transformation Pill&#x2019; and naturally knew the extent of how difficult and troublesome it was to refine this kind of medicinal pill. Back then, if he did not have the help from the &#x2018;Heavenly Flame&#x2019;, he might have found it extremely difficult to succeed in refining it.&#x201D;</p><p>Xiao Yan nodded his head. He lifted it to watch Yue Mei and Mo Basi. Clearly, these two people were also shocked at the price Gu He announced. Their stunned expressions were quite funny.</p><p>Xiao Yan gaze gradually shifted to Queen Medusa in the sky. Clenching his fist tightly, he whispered, &#x201C;Will she agree?&#x201D;</p><p>The people who possessed a similar thought as Xiao Yan, which included Gu He, turned their anxious gaze onto the silent Queen Medusa, waiting for her to speak.</p><p>In the sky, Queen Medusa was quiet for a long time while being stared at by a countless number of gazes. She finally sighed softly, pursed up her sexy red lips and looked at Gu He with pretty eyes that carried some regret. Using a helpless voice, she said, &#x201C;I have to admit that your terms are extremely attractive, but&#x2026;&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;I&#x2019;m sorry, I will not exchange with you!&#x201D;</p>
