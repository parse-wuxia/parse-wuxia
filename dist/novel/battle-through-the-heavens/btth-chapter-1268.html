<p><strong><u>Chapter 1268: Bloody Battle</u></strong></p><p>The brilliant crystal layer hand was suspended on Xiao Yan&#x2019;s palm. Powerful energy pressure spread out from it, causing the space around to tremble intensely&#x2026;</p><p>&#x201C;Go!&#x201D;</p><p>Xiao Yan inhaled a deep breath of air as he flicked his finger gently. That crystal handprint shook and a fine low cry was being emitted. Immediately, it carried a tail of light as it tore through the distance and darted out explosively. In a flash, it violently collided with the large star hand.</p><p>&#x201C;Shatter it!&#x201D;</p><p>Old ghost Zhai Xing&#x2019;s face was ferocious. A thought passed through his mind and the large star hand smashed ruthlessly against the crystal light. This crystal light might be quite strong but he possessed quite a great confidence towards this attack of his. Given Xiao Yan&#x2019;s strength, as long as he did not use that frightening fire lotus, old ghost Zhai Xing had complete confidence that he could suppress the former until he was unable to retaliate!</p><p>However, at this moment, he had forgotten that the current Xiao Yan was no longer the nine star Dou Zong from back then. Although the strength of a three star Dou Zun still had some gap with old ghost Zhai Xing, this gap was no longer one that could not be make up for.</p><p>&#x201C;Bang!&#x201D;</p><p>The large hand and the light seal, which were of completely different size, suddenly collided under the many gazes. A shocking voice immediately resounded over this space.</p><p>&#x201C;Bang!&#x201D;</p><p>The two collided and a frightening energy ripple suddenly swept apart like a stormy sea. The space at the middle of the energy storm also collapsed and formed a large dark black hole at this moment. That deep darkness caused one&#x2019;s heart to feel a little chilled.</p><p>At the empty sport within the dark black space, the large star hand and the light seal were emitting a glaring intense light. Wild and violent energy eroded each other crazily. They were just like two wild beast that were doing their best to swallow the other party.</p><p>&#x201C;Chi!&#x201D;</p><p>The large star hand and the crystal light seal continued to emit a wild and violent energy. However, at a certain instant, the two, which were dramatically opposing each other, were finally annihilated at the same time. That manner was as though they were fire seedlings that were suddenly extinguished&#x2026;</p><p>With the annihilation of the two, the energy storm that swept apart also suddenly come to a halt. After which, they swiftly scattered amidst many stunned gazes.</p><p>&#x201C;This brat has actually forcefully blocked the Dense Net Great Star Hand of the old me?&#x201D;</p><p>Old ghost Zhai Xing&#x2019;s expression immediately became gloomy when he saw this scene. At this moment, he finally began to feel that things were a little troublesome. Although this Xiao Yan&#x2019;s actual strength was only that of a one star Dou Zun, he seemed to possess an endless number of high grade Dou Skills. Their strength were so great that it was frightening. Adding the help from the Heavenly Flame, even old ghost Zhai Xing would have some trouble finishing him off&#x2026;</p><p>&#x201C;This brat has just broken through to the Dou Zun class for a short while, yet he is already this strong. If he is allowed to continue training, would it not mean that the old me will not be a match for him?&#x201D; Old ghost Zhai Xing&#x2019;s shrivelled tree bark like face twitched for a moment. An unusually dense desire to kill suddenly erupted within his heart. His expression was gloomy as his empty sleeve suddenly began to move. Immediately, many dark black chains that appeared like poison snakes, Finally, they entangled with each other and directly agglomerated into a hand that was completely made from metal chain.</p><p>The metal chain hand was clenched gently. Old ghost Zhai Xing&#x2019;s face became dense. His shoulders shook and his body become a little illusionary. At a glance, he appeared like a dull fog. His body moved and directly disappeared in a strange fashion.</p><p>Xiao Yan frowned slightly when old ghost Zhai Xing&#x2019;s body disappeared. Vast and mighty spiritual strength swiftly spread out from between his brows. Immediately, his expression suddenly changed and his body abruptly pulled back!</p><p>An illusory figure quickly appeared just as Xiao Yan&#x2019;s body had just pulled back. The metal hand that was created from the dark black chains directly carried a sharp, dark and cold wind that smashed furiously towards Xiao Yan&#x2019;s head.</p><p>&#x201C;Bang!&#x201D;</p><p>Xiao Yan&#x2019;s arms hurriedly blocked in front of him as he looked at the metal fist that was rapidly expanded in front of his eyes. He forcefully received the attack. However, that frightening strength directly shook Xiao Yan&#x2019;s hands until they become numb. His body also stepped back unsteadily. Xiao Yan was naturally no match for old ghost Zhai Xing when it came to head on Dou Qi clash.</p><p>&#x201C;Chi!&#x201D;</p><p>Old ghost Zhai Xing laughed coldly after forcing Xiao Yan&#x2019;s back with a punch. His body trembled and he appeared to have teleported as he once again appeared in front of Xiao Yan.</p><p>Seeing old ghost Zhai Xing closely chasing from behind, Xiao Yan hurriedly activated the Three Thousand Lightning Movement to its limit. Numerous afterimages surfaced in the sky. His body also swiftly rushed backwards.</p><p>&#x201C;The illusory ghost agility skill of the old me is not something that the Three Thousand Lightning Movement of yours can compare with!&#x201D;</p><p>A cold laughter was being emitted from the empty space. Xiao Yan&#x2019;s eyes became dazzled. All he could see was that old ghost Zhai Xing had once again appeared in front of him. Those afterimages did not pose any obstruction to him!</p><p>&#x201C;This old ghost is really fast&#x2026;&#x201D;</p><p>Xiao Yan&#x2019;s expression changed slightly when he saw old ghost Zhai Xing adhering to him like a maggot in one&#x2019;s bones. He had already used the Three Thousand Lightning Movement to its limit but was actually still unable to match old ghost Zhai Xing. It seemed that the level of this so called illusory ghost agility skill was of a higher level than the Three Thousand Lightning Movement.</p><p>&#x201C;Go and die!&#x201D;</p><p>Old ghost Zhai Xing laughed in a savage fashion. This illusory ghost agility skill was one of his ultimate skills. He had never used it against anyone below a five star Dou Zun level. Today, however, he was forced to use all of his strength to deal with Xiao Yan.</p><p>&#x201C;Bang! Bang! Bang!&#x201D;</p><p>Old ghost Zhai Xing had a dense and cold face. His palm wind was just like a storm that came pouring down. It appeared to violently smash towards Xiao Yan in a violent fashion. Under this crazy attack, the space itself was being forcefully pressured into a concave form. A sonic boom sound continued to resound across the sky.</p><p>Xiao Yan continued to be forced back in defeat under this attack of old ghost Zhai Xing. Although he ended up in a disadvantage, Xiao Yan&#x2019;s expression still remained calm. The purple brown flame rapidly rotated after forcefully receiving the attacks from old ghost Zhai Xing. Waves after waves of strange energy spread out and swiftly healed Xiao Yan&#x2019;s injuries.</p><p>The undying and recovery ability of the Three Thousand Burning Flame was finally being displayed to its greatest degree. As long as the flame was not extinguished, Xiao Yan was able to continuously recover from his injuries&#x2026; of course, the precondition was that he possessed sufficient Dou Qi to be squandered by the Three Thousand Burning Flame.</p><p>Following this continuous cycle of being injured and healed, Xiao Yan had also started to become wilder because of the fight. At the end, he had basically given up all of his defence. He actually directly chose the most dangerous head on collision method. Each time old ghost Zhai Xing struck him with a punch, he would also unceremoniously return a punch to the other party. In any case, he had the Three Thousand Burning Flame to preserve his life. Although Xiao Yan had to endure quite a great amount of pain, he would not need to worry about his life being in any danger. Of course, the precondition was that he was not struck until even the Three Thousand Burning Flame did not have the time to heal him&#x2026;</p><p>&#x201C;Bang bang bang!&#x201D;</p><p>Everyone were stunned when they saw the two people in the sky having become distorted into a chaotic battle. A one star Dou Zun actually dared to engage in such a crazy collision with a five star Dou Zun. This was something that they had never heard of&#x2026;</p><p>&#x201C;This bastard&#x2026;&#x201D;</p><p>The crazy battle continued. However, old ghost Zhai Xing became increasingly frightened the more he fought. Xiao Yan had basically forcefully endured dozens of his punches. Logically speaking, forget about a one star Dou Zun, even a genuine three star Dou Zun would likely have long since been defeated after suffering from serious injuries. Yet, other than appearing a little miserable looking, Xiao Yan in front of him was just like a cockroach, becoming increasingly powerful the longer the fight dragged on.</p><p>&#x201C;It&#x2019;s the Three Thousand Burning Flame!&#x201D;</p><p>The experience of this old ghost Zhai Xing was also quite great. Upon seeing the purple brown flame that was lingering on Xiao Yan&#x2019;s body, he suddenly understood the reason. His face quickly turned green. With the Three Thousand Burning Flame protecting Xiao Yan&#x2019;s body, the latter appeared just as though he was carrying a high quality healing medicine with him. With just a thought, the Three Thousand Burning Flame would swiftly heal the spot where he was injured. Who would dare to compare with him in terms of endurance in this kind of rogue battle.</p><p>Old ghost Zhai Xing did not dare to continue fighting when he thought of this. Although the Three Thousand Burning Flame exhausted quite a lot of Dou Qi to heal an injury, Xiao Yan&#x2019;s appearance of being full of energy did not look like a person who was about to exhaust all of his Dou Qi.</p><p>&#x201C;Use the Dou Technique. Kill him in one attack!&#x201D;</p><p>Old ghost Zhai Xing&#x2019;s expression sunk. His body swiftly became illusory. After which, he disappeared once again.</p><p>&#x201C;Is he competing in terms of speed again&#x2026;&#x201D;</p><p>Xiao Yan, whose clothes was in tatters, parted his mouth when he saw old ghost Zhai Xing&#x2019;s body disappeared. An unusually dense pain was seeping out from every part of his body. Almost all of old ghost Zhai XIng&#x2019;s punches had landed on flesh. Although his injuries had been quickly recovered due to the Three Thousand Burning Flame, the pain appeared to have been magnified by dozens of times at this moment. This caused the muscles all over Xiao Yan&#x2019;s body to tremble involuntarily.</p><p>&#x201C;The Dou Qi exhaustion is too great. I cannot continue to drag it out like this with him. Otherwise, the first one to fall will definitely be me&#x2026;&#x201D;</p><p>Xiao Yan inhaled a deep breath of air. He suppressed the intense pain that was being transmitted from all over his body. The seal formed by his hands changed. After which, the clothes on his back moved. Immediately, he heard a tearing sound as a pair of bone wings suddenly shot out.</p><p>The bone wings had a jade like colour. It was crystal clear. Numerous strange green red lines spread within this crystal, giving it an extremely mysterious appearance.</p><p>This bone wings was naturally something that Xiao Yan had used the Heaven Demon Phoenix wings to refine and create. However, due to him being afraid that the Heaven Demon Phoenix tribe would pester him and that he did not possess the qualification to fight with the Heaven Demon Phoenix tribe, he had been hiding it within his body. Yet, he had no choice but to use it today. In any case, the current Heaven Demon Phoenix tribe did not display any friendly intention towards him. In that case, he no longer needed to hide.</p><p>&#x201C;Chi!&#x201D;</p><p>Old ghost Zhai Xing&#x2019;s figure surfaced in a ghost like manner in the empty sky. His hands formed some seals with lightning like speed. Vast and mighty energy swiftly surged.</p><p>&#x201C;Boom!&#x201D;</p><p>The energy had just been gathered when a hot sharp wind suddenly struck. It caused old ghost Zhai Xing&#x2019;s expression to change. His body hurriedly pulled back. However, he had just done so when the sharp wind strangely turned towards his back. After which, it violently landed on his back.</p><p>&#x201C;Groan!&#x201D;</p><p>The sudden heavy attack had directly shook old ghost Zhai Xing until he continued to be forced back. A muffled moan was being emitted from his throat. He suddenly raised his head and looked at Xiao Yan, who was flapping a pair of jade bone wings. A disbelief surfaced within his eyes. The speed of the latter had basically soared to a frightening stage that even he could not sense.</p><p>&#x201C;Old ghost, try and receive another fire lotus from me!&#x201D;</p><p>The bone wings were flapped gently as Xiao Yan let out a cold laughter. He flicked his finger and three clusters of Heavenly Flames surfaced in front of him. After which, they collided with lightning speed due to a thought of his.</p><p>The expression of old ghost Zhai Xing suddenly changed drastically when he saw that Xiao Yan was intending to merge the Heavenly Flames again. His body flashed and he whisked towards Xiao Yan with lightning like speed.</p><p>&#x201C;Your current speed&#x2026; is insufficient.&#x201D; Xiao Yan smiled when he saw this. He flapped the bone wings and his body swiftly pulled back like a meteorite, abandoning old ghost Zhai Xing far behind him. With the bone wings aiding him, his speed could already overlook most elite Dou Zuns.</p><p>&#x201C;If he isn&#x2019;t sufficient, will it be sufficient if I am added in?&#x201D;</p><p>Xiao Yan&#x2019;s words had just sounded when a shady cold laughter suddenly resounded over the sky. Immediately, two blurry figures rushed passed the empty space. In almost an instant, they had appeared a short distance in front of Xiao Yan.</p><p>The sudden appearance of the human figures also caused Xiao Yan&#x2019;s face to change a little. His eyes swept over the two figures. His heart suddenly sunk when he saw that the backs of these two individuals had a pair of wings.</p><p>&#x201C;Heaven Demon Phoenix tribe?&#x201D;</p>
