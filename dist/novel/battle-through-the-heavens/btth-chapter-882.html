<p><strong><u>Chapter 882: Once And For All</u></strong></p><p>The bone wings were gently flapped. The sound they carried was like muffled lightning with a wild whistling. After sensing the energy that was contained within the bone wings, Xiao Yan stored them away while feeling pleased.</p><p>The bone wings swiftly shrank amid a slight glow. Finally, they transformed into two fine lines that shot into Xiao Yan&#x2019;s body and disappeared.</p><p>After the bone wings entered his body, Xiao Yan sensed them before involuntarily letting out a slight smile. The Gold Geese Sect did not rely on luck in order to become the overlord of their empire. The so-called Sky Bird Nine Flying Wings was indeed mysterious. It was top notch when it came to fleeing for one&#x2019;s life. If Medusa had not taken advantage of when Luo Yan Tian was fooling around with a woman, it was likely that she would not have been able to kill him so easily.</p><p>Now that the bone wings had been successfully refined, Xiao Yan had also gained an additional guarantee. If he were to meet an expert whom he had difficulty contending with in the future, he would at least be able to flee even if he could not beat him. With his current speed and these bone wings, it was likely that he could rival the speed of an extremely strong Dou Zong.</p><p>Xiao Yan let out a soft sigh after having returned the bone wings to his body. After which, he slowly walked to the room&#x2019;s door and opened it.</p><p>&#x201C;Creak&#x2026;&#x201D;</p><p>A warm glaring sunlight seeped in like mercury as the door to the room was slowly opened, causing Xiao Yan&#x2019;s eyes to naturally narrow. A moment later, he got used to the light, so he slowly stepped out of the room.</p><p>&#x201C;You have finally come out&#x2026;&#x201D; A clear female voice was transmitted from within the small yard in front of Xiao Yan after he stepped out. The latter raised his head, only to see an elegant white figure sitting beside a rock table. Other than the Little Fairy Doctor, who else could that demeanor belong to?</p><p>Xiao Yan smiled. He walked into the small yard and sat beside the Little Fairy Doctor. He then said, &#x201C;Are you used to this Inner Academy?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Yes.&#x201D; Little Fairy Doctor smiled and nodded. She softly replied, &#x201C;I have never enjoyed such an atmosphere. It is really quite likable.&#x201D;</p><p>Xiao Yan was silent as he heard the sadness in the Little Fairy Doctor&#x2019;s tone. He knew that the Little Fairy Doctor&#x2019;s life had been harsh ever since she was young. She had walked to this point alone. If she had been able to stay in the Jia Nan Academy for a period of time when she was young, her character might not be so eccentric. Unfortunately, the &#x2018;Woeful Poison Body&#x2019; of hers had caused her to live her life in loneliness.</p><p>&#x201C;How has your &#x2018;Woeful Poison Body&#x2019; been recently?&#x201D; Xiao Yan softly coughed after sensing the somewhat incorrect atmosphere. He hurriedly changed the topic and made an inquiry.</p><p>&#x201C;It is fine. I am barely able to suppress it. However, according to my expectations, I should be able to endure for another year. At that time, if I am unable to completely control this &#x2018;Woeful Poison Body,&#x2019; perhaps&#x2026; it will completely erupt.&#x201D; The Little Fairy Doctor smiled slightly, braced her attention, and spoke.</p><p>&#x201C;Over a year huh&#x2026;&#x201D; Xiao Yan&#x2019;s expression was somewhat solemn as he muttered. He nodded and replied in a deep voice, &#x201C;Relax, the Bodhisattva Body Transformation Saliva has already landed in my hands. All I need is to obtain the final Monster Core in order to control your &#x2018;Woeful Poison Body.&#x2019; In the future, you will no longer need to worry about harming the people beside you unintentionally.&#x2019;</p><p>&#x201C;Yes&#x2026; I believe you.&#x201D; The Little Fairy Doctor&#x2019;s voice was gentle as she spoke. A moment later, she seemed to have recalled something and said, &#x201C;That&#x2019;s right, First Elder Su Qian has said that you should go and find him in the Meeting Room if you come out. They are discussing how to settle the matter regarding the Blazing Sky Qi Refining Tower.&#x201D;</p><p>Xiao Yan smiled and nodded after hearing this. He waved his hand toward the Little Fairy Doctor and said, &#x201C;Let&#x2019;s go together&#x2026;&#x201D; After saying this, he took the lead to stand up, and walked out of the small yard before heading in the direction where the Elders Meeting Room was located. The Little Fairy Doctor behind him hesitated for a moment before following.</p><p>&#x201C;Creak&#x2026;&#x201D;</p><p>The door to the Meeting Room, filled with a solemn atmosphere, was suddenly opened. Two figures slowly walked in. The few Elders who had been engaged in a discussion hurriedly stood up when they saw them.</p><p>&#x201C;He he, we have waited for you for two days already&#x2026;&#x201D; Su Qian looked at the Inner Academy Elders who had cupped their hands when they saw Xiao Yan. He involuntarily fondled his beard and laughed.</p><p>&#x201C;I&#x2019;m sorry, there was an urgent matter to attend to. Thus, I was delayed.&#x201D; Xiao Yan smiled somewhat apologetically. After which, he led the Little Fairy Doctor to randomly find a seat to sit. He smiled and looked at Su Qian before saying, &#x201C;First Elder, when should I replenish the Heart Flame of the Blazing Sky Qi Refining Tower? All you need to do is say the word. Xiao Yan will definitely do my best.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;There is no rush&#x2026;&#x201D; Su Qian waved his hand as he replied, &#x201C;An ordinary Heart Flame replenishment would be extremely incredible if it could at the very most enable the Blazing Sky Qi Refining Tower to last for two to three years. However, you are going to the distant Central Plains in the future. At that time, you will not be able to come and go like you can now. Therefore, we must find a long term guarantee this time around.&#x201D;</p><p>Xiao Yan nodded slightly when he heard this. He was naturally alright with this outcome if it was possible. After all, he also clearly knew that he would not be able to make a trip to the Inner Academy every two to three years. At that time, if the Fallen Heart Flame were to lose its effect, who would come to replenish it?</p><p>&#x201C;What kind of method does First Elder have in mind?&#x201D; Xiao Yan knit his brows slightly and asked.</p><p>&#x201C;There is indeed a method. However, it would be a burden on you&#x2026;&#x201D; Su Qian smiled and nodded. He immediately flicked his finger on his Storage Ring. A strangely shaped item that had been created by transparent glass appeared on the table&#x2019;s surface. He pointed at this empty crystal item and laughed, &#x201C;This thing was created by a Hall Guardian of the Inner Academy. He calls this a &#x2018;Flame Gathering Pot.&#x2019; If you are able to insert a thread of genuine Fallen Heart Flame essence into it, it would be able to unceasingly produce Heart Flame as long as someone repeatedly poured Dou Qi into it in the future. Of course, the effect of this kind of Heart Flame is naturally not comparable to the extremely powerful effect of the Heart Flame created by the actual body of the Fallen Heart Flame. However, it still possesses some effect on increasing one&#x2019;s training speed.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;However, splitting a thread of essence Fallen Heart Flame would cause you great harm. It is likely that you will need to recuperate for a period of time in order to recover. After all, this needs the essence Heart Flame, not a Heart Flame that was created by the essence flame&#x2026;&#x201D;</p><p>Xiao Yan&#x2019;s gaze observed the strange crystal item with great interest after he heard Su Qian speak. His expression immediately became somewhat unusual. Other than a long funnel above this thing, Xiao Yan really could not discover any part of it that was like a pot. He really did not understand why the Hall Guardian Elder wanted to call this a pot&#x2026;</p><p>&#x201C;The Fallen Heart Flame is something that was originally owned by the Inner Academy. Having it fall into my hand has caused the inconvenience for the Inner Academy. I will definitely not reject such a small matter.&#x201D; Xiao Yan withdrew his comical gaze. His expression had become much solemn as he cupped his hands toward Su Qian and spoke with a deep voice.</p><p>&#x201C;He he, a unique natural object is something that anyone with affinity can obtain. Our Inner Academy has sealed the Fallen Heart Flame for many years since no one could subdue it. Being able to subdue it shows your affinity and ability. There is no need to feel guilty. Moreover, if not for you, it is likely that the Inner Academy would have long been met with a great calamity.&#x201D; Su Qian laughed. After which, he waved his sleeves gently and skillfully delivered the &#x2018;Flame Gathering Pot&#x2019; in front of Xiao Yan. He smiled and said, &#x201C;You should keep this thing first. It is not too late to do it when you are free. In any case, we are not anxious at this time.&#x201D;</p><p>Xiao Yan did not stand ceremony after hearing this. He placed the &#x2018;Flame Gathering Pot&#x2019; into his Storage Ring. Being able to permanently resolve the matter of the Inner Academy&#x2019;s Blazing Flame Qi Refining Tower would allow him to toss aside a big burden within his heart. It would also avoid the need for him to think about it all the time which had started to interfere with his training mental state.</p><p>&#x201C;He he, you should bring your friend and walk around the Jia Nan Academy during this period of time. You can tell me if there is anything that you need. Our Jia Nan Academy does welcome those experts from outside the &#x2018;Black-Corner Region.&#x2019;&#x201D; Su Qian also sighed in relief after settling the matter of the Blazing Sky Qi Refining Tower. After which, he turned his head and smiled as to spoke to the Little Fairy Doctor beside Xiao Yan.</p><p>&#x201C;In that case, we will trouble First Elder&#x2026;&#x201D; The Little Fairy Doctor hesitated for a moment before smiling with a nod. Although she liked silence and did not usually socialize with others, she did not pose much of a threat to Su Qian because of the clearly good relationship between him and Xiao Yan. Her attitude was also much better.</p><p>Su Qian fondled his beard and smiled. He did indeed possess some intention of befriending the Little Fairy Doctor. It was the first time in his many years that he had seen such a young Dou Zong. Her future was definitely going to be extraordinary. It was definitely not a bad thing for the Jia Nan Academy to possess such a friend. However, he also knew that the reason the Little Fairy Doctor was displaying such an attitude toward him was mostly because of Xiao Yan.</p><p>After completing the discussion of the formal matters, the atmosphere within the Meeting Room became much more relaxed. Quite a number of Elders within the Inner Academy were old acquaintances of Xiao Yan. It was naturally unavoidable for some polite words to be exchanged that they had met again. Perhaps it was because of Xiao Yan&#x2019;s status as a tier 6 alchemist but quite a number of Elders attitudes toward him caused even Xiao Yan to be somewhat unable to endure. An alchemist was really an extremely popular occupation.</p><p>The laughing and chatting continued in the Meeting Room for around half an hour or so. Just when Xiao Yan was about to take his leave, the tightly shut door was suddenly and violently pushed opened. Immediately, a cold and stern faced Xiao Li swiftly walked in.</p><p>Everyone in the hall was stunned when they saw Xiao Li&#x2019;s expression. Su Qian immediately frowned slightly and asked, &#x201C;What happened?&#x201D;</p><p>Xiao Li&#x2019;s eyes wandered all around the room. After which, they paused on Xiao Yan and Su Qian. He hesitated for a moment before saying in a deep voice, &#x201C;According to the information that I have obtained, the Demon Flame Valley seems to have quite a lot of activity recently. It seems that the bastard Han Feng has invited the Old Ground Demon Ghost to come out&#x2026;&#x201D;</p><p>Everyone&#x2019;s expression in the hall suddenly changed the moment these words sounded.</p>
