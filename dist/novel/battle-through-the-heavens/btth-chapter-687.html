<p><strong><u>Chapter 687: The Shock of the Misty Cloud Sect</u></strong></p><p>&#x201C;This aura&#x2026;&#x201D;</p><p>Yun Shan&#x2019;s eyes were filled with disbelief. He suddenly stood up and muttered with his mouth, &#x201C;How can it be? This little fellow is actually still alive&#x2026;&#x201D; The muttering had just sounded when Yun Shan seemed to recall something. His expression suddenly changed. His body flashed and disappeared from this training room in a ghost-like manner.</p><p>The direction he had sensed the eruption of this aura earlier was clearly that of the capital. At this moment&#x2026; there was a large unit that the Misty Cloud Sect had sent to the capital!</p><p>The grand hall of the Misty Cloud Sect was completely chaotic. Various noises mixed with panicked voices. Finally, they lingered within the hall, causing one&#x2019;s head to expand with giddiness.</p><p>Yun Shan also knit his brows because of this chaos when his body flashed into the grand hall. He cried out in a deep stern voice, &#x201C;Quiet down. What a scandal to be in such confusion!&#x201D;</p><p>The noise within the hall immediately began to quietly disappear when everyone saw Yun Shan who had suddenly appeared. It was finally completely quiet a moment later.</p><p>Yun Shan coldly snorted only after seeing that the grand hall had recovered its silence. He sat down in the leader&#x2019;s seat and asked, &#x201C;What happened? Is there any news from Yun Du and the others?&#x201D;</p><p>Upon hearing Yun Shan voice his question, an old man in the hall quickly walked over and spoke respectfully while wearing a somewhat pale expression, &#x201C;Reporting to Sect Leader, the spiritual tablet of Yun Fu and three other Elders have suddenly burst apart a moment ago. The spiritual tablet of Yun Sha and the other few elders have also become extremely dim. From the looks of the situation, they have obviously suffered serious injuries!&#x201D;</p><p>The faces of everyone within the grand hall including Yun Shan twitched intensely when the old man&#x2019;s words sounded. The experts whom they had dispatched to the capital were basically over half the strength of the current Misty Cloud Sect. Everyone present believed that there was not a single faction within the Jia Ma Empire, with the exception of the Misty Cloud Sect, who could block such a large lineup. However, the truth that was currently placed in front of them had ruthlessly thrown them a slap on their faces, causing them to be at a loss.</p><p>&#x201C;Elder Yun Cha, have you made a mistake?&#x201D; The silence continued within the grand hall for a moment before dry laughter finally sounded.</p><p>&#x201C;I hope that&#x2019;s the case too&#x2026;&#x201D; The Elder who was addressed as Yun Cha laughed bitterly. He flipped his hand and a pile of broken jade tablets appeared on the table in front of him. The expressions of those people who originally had some doubts within their hearts became ugly when they saw these familiar jade tablets.</p><p>&#x201C;How is this possible. That is two Dou Huangs and seven Dou Wangs. Which faction within this capital had the ability to eat up all of them? By just relying on that Primer clan?&#x201D; An Elder who seemed to have quite a high status furiously spoke with a changing face.</p><p>&#x201C;Don&#x2019;t tell me that the three large clans and the imperial family joined hands?&#x201D; A person suddenly suggested, causing quite a number of people to quietly nod their heads. From the looks of it now, it seemed that this guess was the most reliable one.</p><p>&#x201C;Since they actually dared to join hands and provoke us, the Misty Cloud Sect, I would like to impeach Sect Leader to give the order to completely eradicate the three large clans and the imperial family from the Jia Ma Empire!&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;That&#x2019;s right. Sect Leader, the Misty Cloud Sect will definitely not endure this kind of provocation! We must let them pay the price in blood!&#x201D;</p><p>Yun Shan&#x2019;s face was gloomy as his gaze swept toward the group of agitated Elders and deacons. A moment later, his palm suddenly slammed violently on the table. The intense sound immediately shocked everyone within the hall. Their eyes fearfully looked at Yun Shan and did not quite understand why the latter would be this furious.</p><p>&#x201C;It is not whatever nonsense three large clan joining hands!&#x201D; Yun Shan stood up and spoke in a dark, solemn voice. &#x201C;That little bastard from the Xiao clan has returned.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Xiao clan?&#x201D;</p><p>Everyone was startled when they heard this. They were all at a loss. The small Xiao clan was now lingering on its last breath. How could they have the ability to defeat that large lineup of the Misty Cloud Sect?</p><p>The fury in Yun Shan&#x2019;s heart grew even more intense when he saw the lost expressions on everyone&apos;s faces. However, just as he was unable to control himself and was about to burst out in anger, an exclamation finally sounded in the hall.</p><p>&#x201C;Don&#x2019;t tell me it&#x2019;s that Xiao Yan?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Xiao Yan?&#x201D; The name that was deep within their memories set off the memory that had been hidden in everyone&#x2019;s mind for three years within a short instant. Three years ago, that young man who was not even twenty years old had ascended the Misty Cloud Mountain by himself. He had relied on his own strength to contend with the entire Misty Cloud Sect. Although he ended up being chased out of the Jia Ma Empire, that ferocious wolf-like young man left behind a deep memory that was difficult to remove within a countless number of people from the Misty Cloud Sect.</p><p>The lack of any news of him during these three years had caused everyone to gradually forget about that name and young man. However, by mentioning this name today, the scene from three years ago began to gradually surface in the minds of every single person&#x2026;</p><p>&#x201C;Isn&#x2019;t that fellow dead?&#x201D; The shock persisted for a moment before there was finally someone who muttered with some surprise.</p><p>&#x201C;Who told you that he had died?&#x201D; Yun Shan looked at everyone coldly. His voice was dark and chilly, &#x201C;I sensed his aura earlier. It seems that that fellow should be back. Yun Du and the others might have met with him.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Even if Elder Yun Du&#x2019;s group was to met with that fellow, but&#x2026; but it is not possible for them to suffer such deaths and injuries right? That place has two Dou Huangs and seven Dou Wangs&#x2026; they would not be so quickly defeated even if they were to meet three or four elite Dou Huangs! Don&#x2019;t tell me that Xiao Yan has broken through to the Dou Zong class within these short three years?&#x201D; An Elder involuntarily spoke doubtfully. He had yet to complete his sentence when he began to scoff at his own words.</p><p>&#x201C;Although he might not have broken through to the Dou Zong class, from that aura of his earlier, it is likely that he has reached the Dou Huang class.&#x201D; Yun Shan slowly spoke. His eyelids involuntarily twitched when he spoke until this point. Dou Huang&#x2026; given his current strength, he was naturally aware that although Xiao Yan&#x2019;s fighting strength back then was powerful, his true strength was at the very most that of a Da Dou Shi or a Dou Ling. However, only after a short three years, that fellow had actually reached the Dou Huang class? This speed&#x2026; was indeed frightening!</p><p>A commotion immediately surged within the grand hall when Yun Shan&#x2019;s voice sounded. Even that Elder from earlier revealed a dull face. Advancing to the Dou Huang class in three short years&#x2026; this training talent could only be described as frightening. Looks like, allowing that brat to flee back then was indeed a most regretful matter.</p><p>In three years, he was able to reach the Dou Huang class. It was difficult to imagine what would happen if he was given another three years&#x2026;</p><p>As he thought until this point, even someone as sophisticated as Yun Shan could not help but feel a coldness surging into his heart.</p><p>Yun Shan inhaled a deep breath of air. His eyes were lowered and a wave of killing intent that was difficult to keep in check suddenly swept out from his heart in all directions. He must not allow that person to remain alive. Otherwise, that person would eventually become a big trouble that he would have difficulty finishing off! In the future, the Misty Cloud Sect might really be completely destroyed by that person&#x2019;s hands like what those fellows had said.</p><p>&#x201C;Little bastard. Back then, you can be considered lucky to have fled. However, don&#x2019;t blame the old me for being vicious since you have come looking for me this time around!&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Sect Leader, what should we do now? Should we send someone to go and rescue Elder Yun Du and the others?&#x201D; A person in the grand hall finally recalled Yun Du and the others who were on the brink of death.</p><p>Yun Shan mused for a moment after hearing this. He was just about to nod his head when the expression of Elder Yun Cha, who was managing the spiritual tablets of the many Elders in the sect, changed. His voice was hoarse as he spoke, &#x201C;I think that it is not necessary. Their spiritual tablets&#x2026; have all burst apart.&#x201D;</p><p>The entire place was shocked when these words were spoken. Their heads immediately felt giddy. That was two Dou Huangs and seven Dou Wangs. This lineup had actually completely fallen within a short few hours. Such losses were something that the Misty Cloud Sect had difficulty enduring.</p><p>&#x201C;That bastard. He&#x2019;s too ruthless!&#x201D; Furious curses repeatedly sounded within the hall. However, when they spoke these words, all of them had forgotten that they did not show any mercy when they had attacked the Xiao clan back then.</p><p>The gloominess on Yun Shan&#x2019;s face was abnormally withdrawn in the face of such great losses. He waved his hand with an expressionless face and suppressed the commotion within the grand hall. His gaze flickered for a moment before he spoke in an indifferent voice, &#x201C;There is no longer a need to send anyone to the capital. That little bastard will come looking for us himself. Since that is the case, we shall quietly wait&#x2026;&#x201D;</p><p>Everyone was startled when they heard these words from Yun Shan. Although there was an unwillingness in their hearts, they did not dare to object against Yun Shan&#x2019;s decision. Hence, all they could do was respond respectfully.</p><p>&#x201C;Tell everyone that the Misty Cloud Sect will enter a high alert state from now on. Kill anyone who privately ascends the mountain!&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Yes sir!&#x201D;</p><p>Everyone felt a chill all over their bodies when they heard the dark chilly killing intent in Yun Shan&#x2019;s words as they hurriedly responded. Yun Shan immediately waved his hand and all of them swiftly swarmed out of the grand hall&#x2026;</p><p>The hall was once again completely silent after everyone had left.</p><p>&#x201C;Tsk tsk, how is it? I have just told you some time earlier that Xiao Yan had survived very well within the &#x2018;Black-Corner Region&#x2019;. Looks like the Misty Cloud Sect will be faced with quite the trouble with his return this time around&#x2026;&#x201D; The silence continued for a long time before a cluster of black fog suddenly and strangely appeared in the shadows of the grand hall. It immediately lingered in the large hall as an unusual laugh sounded from within it.</p><p>Yun Shan&#x2019;s face twitched. A ferocity flashed across his eyes as he spoke in a dense manner, &#x201C;He is but a little bastard. Even though he currently possesses the strength of a Dou Huang, this ancestor (refer to rank Dou Zong) can still kill him easily. Once I capture him, I will let him taste a feeling that is worse than death!&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;I am unconcerned about the grudge between the two of you. Coincidentally, he has returned. In that case, most of the members of the Xiao clan have been gathered. It also saves us the trouble of going to the &#x2018;Black-Corner Region&#x2019; to search for him.&#x201D; The black fog moved and a voice once again sounded, &#x201C;According to our information, Xiao Yan has the spiritual body of Yao zun-zhe within his body. It is likely that he has borrowed the help of Yao Chen&#x2019;s spirit in order to kill an expert Dou Wang with his Da Dou Shi&#x2019;s strength. Leave Yao Chen for me to deal with the next time around. All you need to do is to capture Xiao Yan&#x2026;&#x201D;</p><p>TL: zun-zhe - respectful term for a Dou Zun</p><p>Yun Shan nodded slowly. A savage look surged onto his face as he spoke sinisterly, &#x201C;Relax, I will cripple that little bastard&#x2019;s Dou Qi before handing him to you&#x2026;&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Hopefully. However, I would like to remind you that it is best not to underestimate your opponent. Otherwise, your ending at that time might be exceptionally miserable&#x2026;&#x201D;</p><p>The black fog moved slightly as that unusual laugher was once again emitted. Immediately, it strangely and slowly disappeared from within the grand hall, leaving behind the cold smile and savage face of Yun Shan...</p>
