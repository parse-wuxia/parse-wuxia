<p><strong><u>Chapter 1078: Sky Poison Dragon Scorpion Beast</u></strong></p><p>Poison fog lingered deep within the Fallen God Stream. Even the air contained a little stench. It would be quite troublesome if it was absorbed into one&#x2019;s body.</p><p>The interior of the Fallen God Stream was filled with a countless number of enormous dark-black crevices. Occasionally, numerous roars would be emitted from these fissures. All the living creatures in this place seemed to possess a lethal poison after years of evolution. If one were careless, one would fall in the most unexpected place.</p><p>The faint sound of rushing wind suddenly appeared in this desolate region. Immediately, a couple of figures rushed over from the distance. Their figures flashed a couple of times and appeared a hundred meters away. It was only possible to see their appearance once they approached. Naturally, they were Xiao Yan&#x2019;s group, searching for the Sky Poison Dragon Scorpion Beast.</p><p>Xiao Yan&#x2019;s figure gently landed beside a black rock. His eyes looked into the distance, but his sight was severely impeded due to the poison fog.</p><p>&#x201C;Little Fairy Doctor, where is the Sky Poison Dragon Scorpion Beast?&#x201D; Xiao Yan turned his head and looked behind him, where the Little Fairy Doctor and Xin Lan were located.</p><p>The Little Fairy Doctor looked around her after hearing his question. She slightly shut her eyes. Being in possession of the Woeful Poison Body, she appeared to be exceptionally sensitive to certain poison creatures. After sensing for a moment, she once again opened her eyes and pointed to the north. She softly answered, &#x201C;That way. We should arrive soon. I am able to smell the poison on that fellow&#x2019;s body from a great distance.&#x201D;</p><p>Xiao Yan tilted his head. He glanced at the Earth Demon Puppet, following close beside him, and immediately inhaled a gentle breath. It seemed that a fierce battle was unavoidable today. With the strength of an eight star Dou Zong and the powerful physical body of a Magical Beast, this Sky Poison Dragon Scorpion Beast would definitely be an extremely troublesome opponent&#x2026;</p><p>&#x201C;Xin Lan, you should hide further away when the fight begins. Do not get involved in it&#x2026;&#x201D; Xiao Yan instructed Xin Lan before moving his body. He rushed in the direction the Little Fairy Doctor had pointed out.</p><p>Xin Lan nodded. With her strength, it was obvious that she did not have the qualification to participate in a fight of this level. Hence, it was best that she hid far away.</p><p>&#x201C;Let&#x2019;s go, you have consumed the Poison Avoiding Pill that Xiao Yan gave you. As long as you do not take the initiative to disturb those fierce poison beings, they will not come and look for you&#x2026;&#x201D; The Little Fairy Doctor smiled to Xin Lan. After which, she pulled her along and swiftly followed Xiao Yan in front.</p><p>While Xiao Yan&#x2019;s group began to hurry toward the area where the Sky Poison Dragon Scorpion Beast was hiding, the entrance of the Fallen God Stream had become unusually lively because of the arrival of a group of people.</p><p>A large group of white-clothed human figures, containing a shockingly cold aura around their bodies, filled the entrance of the Fallen God Stream. The temperature of this place seemed to have be affected by them as it descended.</p><p>There were four old figures standing with their shoulders bent right at the front. These four figures randomly stood. There were three majestic, ice-cold auras slowly spreading apart among them, giving one a kind of extremely pressurizing feeling.</p><p>The person who attracted the most attention among the four of them was an elder. This old man had white hair and was holding a walking stick with a snake head that appeared to be made from white jade. The snake head&#x2019;s large, savage mouth was widened, and it had a pair of snake eyes which emitted a dark, cold aura. He appeared exceptionally ordinary compared to the three elders beside him. Not even a little energy seeped out of his body. Even that elderly face appeared exceptionally shriveled. His narrowed eyes appeared turbid. His appearance was no different from that of an ordinary old man.</p><p>The thing that surprised others was that this old man, who did not seem special, was actually standing at the middle of this group of people. Even the three white-clothed, old men with majestic auras remained half a step behind him. Their brows revealed a respectful expression.</p><p>There were many people currently watching the show around the Fallen God Stream&#x2019;s entrance. They were startled when they saw this lineup, especially when they saw the special snow flower image on the clothes of these people. A commotion was stirred as a result.</p><p>&#x201C;They are people from the Ice River Valley?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;The one leading them are four expert Dou Zongs? Heavens, what does this Ice River Valley intend to do?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;According to rumors, Bing Fu along with two other Ice River Valley&#x2019;s Elders and some disciples have all died in the hands of the Woeful Poison Lady. From the looks of it, the Ice River Valley is really angered this time around. If I have guessed correctly, that old man holding the walking stick should be that Elder Tian She from the Ice River Valley&#x2026; even in the Ice River Valley, he is considered an important person ranked among the top three&#x2026;&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Elder Tian She? It is actually him? It is unexpected that the Ice River Valley has even dispatched him this time around&#x2026; that Woeful Poison Lady will likely have a difficult time escaping this time around.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;......&#x201D;</p><p>The surrounding private conversations did not disturb this white-clothed group. The white-haired, old man holding a walking stick made in the shape of a snake opened his somewhat turbid eyes. He faintly asked, &#x201C;Is everyone here?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Everyone is here and waiting for Elder Tian She&#x2019;s orders.&#x201D; A white-clothed, old man by the side hurriedly replied.</p><p>The old man called Elder Tian She nodded slowly. He extended his hand and a coldness lingered over it. After which, an ice mirror was formed. A picture was present on the ice mirror. Coincidentally, the images of Xiao Yan, the Little Fairy Doctor, the Earth Demon Puppet, and even Tian Huo zun-zhe were present in the picture.</p><p>&#x201C;These are the remnant figures found in the damaged souls of the Ice River Valley&#x2019;s disciples. However, it is unexpected that the Woeful Poison Lady had external reinforcements. However, these few people are extremely foreign to the old me. It is likely that they are people from outside the Pill Region&#x2026; Ke ke, the Ice River Valley has not met such a challenge for many years. The hands of the old me are almost rusty&#x2026;&#x201D; The old man holding the snake walking stick swept his turbid eyes over the ice mirror and laughed. His laughter was just like that of an owl, giving one goosebumps.</p><p>A chill surfaced on the skin of the three white clothed elders when they heard this laugh. They knew that the happier the laugh of this person, the denser the killing intent was in his heart.</p><p>&#x201C;Let&#x2019;s go, the old me really wishes to meet this group of foreign experts soon. The might of the Ice River Valley cannot be challenged&#x2026;&#x201D;</p><p>The old man gently waved his hand. After which, he lifted the snake walking stick and slowly walked into the Fallen God Stream. All the disciples from the Ice River Valley followed close behind them. They did not create even the slightest sound when they walked, displaying an appearance of being well-trained.</p><p>Numerous gazes looked at the people from the Ice River Valley as they gradually disappeared from their sight. They looked to each other and a fiery heat appeared in their eyes. All of them knew that this Fallen God Stream would likely cease to be calm&#x2026;</p><p>&#x2026;</p><p>&#x201C;We have arrived&#x2026; that rock fortress is where our target is located.&#x201D;</p><p>Xiao Yan&#x2019;s footsteps paused suddenly when he heard this. After which, he raised his head, narrowed his eyes and looked into the distance. He could see a large, white-colored rock fortress vaguely visible under the cover of the dense fog.</p><p>&#x201C;The Sky Poison Dragon Scorpion Beast is in that place?&#x201D;</p><p>Xiao Yan rubbed his hands. A heat surfaced in his eyes. After searching the Black-Corner Region all the way to the Central Plains, he had finally found a living Sky Poison Dragon Scorpion Beast.</p><p>The Little Fairy Doctor smiled and nodded. She said, &#x201C;I think that it is likely that it has sensed my presence. It seems that a poison beast that has reached such a rank also possesses a sensitivity to this Woeful Poison Body of mine&#x2026;&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;In that case, let us see just what this so-called ancient poison beast looks like. Xin Lan, you should remain here. Do not follow us.&#x201D; Xiao Yan smiled before instructing Xin Lan.</p><p>&#x201C;Understood.&#x201D; Xin Lan nodded before reminding, &#x201C;All of you should be careful.&#x201D;</p><p>Xiao Yan grinned. His toes pressed on the ground and his body turned into a black line that rushed toward the rock fortress. The Little Fairy Doctor and the Earth Demon Puppet followed close behind him.</p><p>With the speed of the three of them, they had appeared within a thousand meters of the rock fortress after a short moment. Following their approach, they were finally able to sense just how large this rock fortress was. The place appeared exceptionally vast and mighty.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>Just when these three people stepped into a thousand meter radius of this rock fortress, the land suddenly began to shake. Immediately, a soul-stirring dragon roar was emitted from the rock fortress, and a violent storm swept over, sending the rock fragments on the ground flying!</p><p>&#x201C;Ha ha, little beauty. It is unexpected that you have come looking for me. In that case, you should obediently stay behind and be my woman. This king wants that Woeful Poison Body of yours to give birth to perfect descendants with the purest bloodline!&#x201D;</p><p>The dragon roar resounded over the place as a loud laugh was emitted from the rock fortress. After which, the roar spread apart like a wave.</p><p>One could hear the sharp sound of rushing wind appearing after the loud laugh rang out. A blood-red figure rushed out of the rock fortress in a lightning-like manner. A pair of hundred-foot-large dragon wings were extended from his back. A blood-colored scorpion tail, over ten meters long, was behind it. The tip of the tail contained a sharp, cold glow.</p><p>The figure remained suspended in the sky with the round moon located behind it. Both of its wings were extended and its poison tail appeared just like a snake. It hissed to the sky while a monstrous fog spread.</p><p>Xiao Yan&#x2019;s group slowly stopped. They looked at the human figure with its dragon wings in the distant sky. They sensed the monstrous aura and surprise flashed across their eyes. Was this that legendary Sky Poison Dragon Scorpion Beast?</p><p>&#x201C;It is indeed very strong&#x2026; however, its Monster Core and Essence Blood are ours&#x2026;&#x201D;</p>
