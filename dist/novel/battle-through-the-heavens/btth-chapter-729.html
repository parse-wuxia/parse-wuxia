<p><strong><u>Chapter 729: Poison Sect</u></strong></p><p>Xiao Yan&#x2019;s eyes flicked around when he saw Hai Bodong&#x2019;s smiling manner. A moment later, he narrowed his eyes and nodded slightly. He spoke in a deep voice, &#x201C;In that case, I would need to trouble Old Hai to help me contact chairman Fa Ma and the heads of the few other large clans once I completely recover from my injuries. It is also time for the sky of the Jia Ma Empire to change!&#x201D;</p><p>Hai Bodong grinned and nodded upon hearing this. He ultimately believed that Xiao Yan&#x2019;s footsteps should not stop in the Jia Ma Empire. The enormous Dou Qi Continent would be the place for him to play in.</p><p>Xiao Yan did not go out during the period after he and Hai Bodong had finished their discussion. Instead, he quietly remained in the Xiao Mansion and focused on recuperating from his injuries. If he wanted to build a faction that was even stronger than the Misty Cloud Sect in this Jia Ma Empire, he would need to have a sufficient strength to deter all the factions and experts within the empire. Otherwise, it would merely just be a joke in the end.</p><p>During the time that Xiao Yan was calmly recuperating, the Misty Cloud Mountain had finally been completely emptied. After many Misty Cloud Sect&#x2019;s disciples left, some people within the Jia Ma Empire, who thought that the news was a rumor, finally began to believe that the enormous sect, that had dominated the Jia Ma Empire for a few hundred years, was truly about to disappear from this empire.</p><p>Following the dismissal of the Misty Cloud Sect&#x2019;s disciples, the situation within the empire also became somewhat strange. In the past, the overlord of the Jia Ma Empire was undoubtedly the Misty Cloud Sect. Now that the Misty Cloud Sect had toppled, that position naturally caused many factions to have red eyes as they coveted after it. Of course, they might have red eyes but there was not a single person who was foolish enough to step forward and announce that they would replace the Misty Cloud Sect. This was because everyone knew that the only person within the Jia Ma Empire who had the qualification and ability to do so was the third young master of the Xiao clan. The person who had defeated Yun Shan, Xiao Yan!</p><p>Everyone was waiting for the next course of action from that young man who chose silence.</p><p>Jia Xing Tian and Princess Yao Ye were seated in a quiet hall within the Jia Ma Imperial City. They would occasionally frown a little as they conversed softly.</p><p>&#x201C;Yun Yun has already dismissed all of the disciples from the Misty Cloud Sect. This Misty Cloud Sect will become history within the Jia Ma Empire in the future.&#x201D; Yao Ye rubbed her forehead. She had been observing each and every single action of the Misty Cloud Sect during these few days. Only after seeing that Yun Yun had really acted according to the agreement did she sigh in relief. The imperial family had been worried and afraid of this enormous being, that had been close to the imperial city for an unknown number of years. They were naturally not going to give it any chance to make a comeback now that they had the opportunity to topple it.</p><p>Jia Xing Tian nodded slightly. However, there was no much smiles on his face. His gaze passed through the window and swept in a certain direction in the capital before muttering, &#x201C;Although we have gotten rid of this ferocious tiger known as the Misty Cloud Sect, another even stronger and younger mighty lion has arrived. I wonder if this is a blessing or a curse to the Jia Ma imperial family.&#x201D;</p><p>Yao Ye was silent. She immediately let out a soft sigh and said, &#x201C;This is something that we have no choice in. It was impossible for us to overthrow the Misty Cloud Sect with just our strength. Everyone was aware of the Misty Cloud Sect&#x2019;s wild ambition. If we were to allow them to continue developing, they would definitely have acted against our imperial family. At that time, I&#x2019;m afraid that Yun Shan alone would be able to easily wipe out everyone within our imperial family.&#x201D;</p><p>Jia Xing Tian&#x2019;s expression was solemn as he slowly said, &#x201C;I have received news. I&#x2019;m afraid that Xiao Yan has the intention to establish a faction within the empire. At that time, there might be another &#x2018;Misty Cloud Sect&#x2019;. Tell me, what should we do about this?&#x201D;</p><p>Yao Ye&#x2019;s expression also became much more grave as she heard this. She mused for a long time before shaking her head and laughing bitterly once again. She said, &#x201C;Xiao Yan&#x2019;s current strength is already not any weaker than the Misty Cloud Sect. Even without mentioning his existence, which was one that could contend against an elite Dou Zong, there was still a genuine elite Dou Zong by his side. That Queen Medusa caused us to suffer great losses back then. If we were to reveal even a little enmity to him, it is likely that we would end up courting disaster instead.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Don&#x2019;t tell me that we must just open our eyes and watch Xiao Yan establish his faction?&#x201D; Jia Xing Tian frowned and said.</p><p>&#x201C;Xiao Yan&#x2019;s character is not as vicious as Yun Shan. He is also someone who values relationships. One would only end up suffering if one takes the hard approach against such a person. Hence, it is likely that we can only go about in a roundabout gentle manner.&#x201D; Yao Ye thought for a moment before slowly speaking.</p><p>&#x201C;Gentle?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Xiao Yan is a person who will return more respect if someone respects him. If you quietly possess ill will to him and he were to discover it, he would immediately turn against you. He would also be merciless in his attack.&#x201D; Yao Ye voiced her thoughts, &#x201C;Since our current strength is unable to pose much of a hindrance to him, why don&#x2019;t we help move things along. If our imperial family were to follow, we might gain some benefits.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;You mean that we should not only not stop him from establish a faction but should also lend him a hand?&#x201D; Jia Xing Tian was stunned as he asked in an incredulous manner.</p><p>&#x201C;There is no other method than this.&#x201D; Yao Ye helplessly nodded. There were many experts around Xiao Yan. If they were to anger him, he could dispatch Medusa over. How many experts in this imperial city could contend with her? Since they could not use force, what other method could they use other than the soft approach?</p><p>Jia Xing Tian knit his brows tightly. His hand gently tapped on the surface of the table before sighing a moment later. He said, &#x201C;Alright, we will do as you say and give it a try first. Hopefully, this fellow will not be like Yun Shan in wanting to replace our imperial family. Otherwise, I will not let him off easily even if I have to fight until the both of us are seriously injured.&#x201D;</p><p>Yao Ye smiled slightly when she saw Jia Xing Tian nodded. She mused for a moment before suddenly speaking, &#x201C;Actually, our Jia Ma Empire also suffers quite a lot of drawbacks with the disappearance of the Misty Cloud Sect. Having lost them, our Jia Ma Empire would not even have the qualification to participate in the future northwestern Great Meeting of Fractions. In this way, it is likely that we would be ridiculed by our neighboring countries. That&#x2019;s right&#x2026; I heard that there is quite a lot of activity in the Chu Yun Empire recently. Originally, the country had many large and small factions. However, they were repeatedly destroyed during these few years. Currently, the country possesses an enormous faction.</p><p>&#x201C;Aye, I have also heard of it. That faction seems to be called the &#x2018;Poison Sect&#x2019;. Not only is it mysterious and unpredictable, but according to our information, the mysterious Sect Leader of the &#x2018;Poison Sect&#x2019; might well have a frightening strength that could contend against an elite Dou Zong. They might well leap and become a powerful faction that could contend with the &#x2018;Sky Serpent Mansion&#x2019; and the &#x2018;Thunderbolt Sect&#x2019; in the next &#x2018;Great Meeting of Factions&#x2019;. At that time, the Chu Yun Empire might become even more arrogant&#x2026;&#x201D; Jia Xing Tian&#x2019;s expression sank slightly at the mention of this. The Chu Yun Empire and the Jia Ma Empire were like water and fire. Almost every year, some conflict would erupt at their borders. Both parties could not see eye to eye with each other.</p><p>&#x201C;Therefore, if our Jia Ma Empire is unable to produce a powerful faction and experts that are not an embarrassment, it is likely that our position in this northwestern region would sink even lower.&#x201D; Yao Ye sighed as she spoke.</p><p>Jia Xing Tian nodded his head. His gaze flickered for a moment before he spoke in a deep voice, &#x201C;Looks like we must still rely on Xiao Yan. Alright. I shall trust this little fellow once again!&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Great-grandfather will not be disappointed.&#x201D; Yao Ye smiled. She was usually good at judging people. Xiao Yan was a person who valued relationships greatly. He would definitely be unable to do something like repaying a favor with malice.</p><p>&#x201C;You are so confident in him?&#x201D; Jia Xing Tian&#x2019;s face immediately revealed a strange expression. He swept over Yao Ye&#x2019;s pretty face before suddenly speaking with a smile, &#x201C;Yao Ye, don&#x2019;t tell me that you have a crush on that little fellow?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Great-grandfather, what nonsense are you talking!&#x201D; Yao Ye&#x2019;s face immediately turned flushed red upon hearing Jia Xing Tian&#x2019;s words as she spoke in a pampered manner.</p><p>&#x201C;That fellow&#x2019;s talent is the most frightening one that I have seen in so many years. His appearance is also quite good. His character is cold and stern but he greatly values relationships. He is quite a good catch. If you really like him, great-grandfather can help you mention it to him. I would also be able to completely be at ease if our two families can be related by marriage.&#x201D; Jia Xing Tian just continued speaking as though he did not see the flushed redness on Yao Ye&#x2019;s face.</p><p>&#x201C;You can forget about it. There is even someone like Medusa whose beauty could bring disaster to a country or city beside that fellow. Even if you wish to marry Yao Ye away, he might not even be willing to accept me.&#x201D; Yao Ye rolled her eyes at Jia Xing Tian and helplessly shook her head as she replied. Although she did admire Xiao Yan greatly, being a princess of an imperial family and the future Queen, who would control the Jia Ma Empire, her haughty self would naturally be unwilling to share her husband with other women regardless of how outstanding he was.</p><p>Jia Xing Tian knit his brows when he heard this. He also nodded helplessly. It seemed that the fellow really had a little too many women beside him. Moreover, the most important thing was that he seemed to have no other thoughts toward Yao Ye. This caused him to feel extremely helpless. All he could do was abandon the thought in his heart.</p><p>&#x201C;Forget it. I will represent the imperial family to express our concerns once that fellow has recuperated from his injuries, and let slip some of the imperial family&#x2019;s thoughts to him. The Jia Ma Empire does indeed need a powerful faction and experts that it can take out. From the looks of it now, only this fellow is most suitable.&#x201D; Jia Xing Tian waved his hand, stood up, and slowly walked out while he spoke.</p><p>Yao Ye nodded slightly as she looked at Jia Xing Tian&#x2019;s back.</p><p>&#x201C;That&#x2019;s right, you should try your best to send more spies to investigate the &#x2018;Poison Sect&#x2019; from the Chu Yun Empire. There would be no negative impact on us by gaining more information.&#x201D; Jia Xing Tian seemed to have remembered something after he reached the door. He paused his footsteps as he spoke.</p><p>&#x201C;Hence, you should pay a little more attention on this matter. I keep having the feeling that there is something not quite right with this &#x2018;Poison Sect&#x2019;. Being able to destroy all the large and small factions within the Chu Yun Empire is not something that an ordinary person could do. However, within the Chu Yun Empire&#x2026; there does not seem to be such an expert right?&#x201D; Jia Xing Tian&#x2019;s face was filled with doubt. He could only sigh and shake his head a moment later. He spoke, &#x201C;Ugh, looks like the Chu Yun Empire is quite chaotic during these few years. Just what is the origin of that &#x2018;Poison Sect&#x2019;?&#x201D;</p><p>Jia Xing Tian could only give up his futile thoughts. He sighed and walked out of the hall.</p><p>Yao Ye also laughed bitterly as she looked at Jia Xing Tian&#x2019;s disappearing back. She had long since dispatch a large number of spies. However, that &#x2018;Poison Sect&#x2019; acted extremely strange. It was extremely difficult to inquire about news within the sect. Moreover, their interior was also tightly-guarded. Even if a spy could sneak in, it was still extremely difficult to make contact with their core within a short period of time. The most recent information she had received from the Chu Yun Empire only contained two short words.</p><p>Poison Woman!</p><p>&#x201C;Poison Woman?&#x201D; Yao Ye softly muttered the words in the hall. Her voice was filled with doubt and ignorance.</p>
