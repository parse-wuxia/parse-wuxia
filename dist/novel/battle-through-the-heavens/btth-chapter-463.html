<p><strong><u>Chapter 463: Training Accelerator</u></strong></p><p>Just as Xiao Yan&#x2019;s feet landed inside the tower&#x2019;s entrance, his entire body suddenly solidified. His delicate and handsome face was like burning charcoal and waves of faint, white-colored fog, that carried a &#x2018;chi chi&#x2019; sound of meat being grilled, emitted from within his body.</p><p>Beside Xiao Yan, Wu Hao, who had similarly entered the tower at the same time, had a face that was similarly flushed red at this moment. White-colored fog also began to be emitted from his body like a rut.</p><p>The two of them stood at the door of the tower without moving. Some of the older students, who were entering from behind, originally rebuked them. However, when they saw Xiao Yan&#x2019;s and Wu Hao&#x2019;s situation, they immediately stopped the scolding and laughingly said in a gloating manner, &#x201C;Looks like these two should be new students who just entered the Inner Academy. They actually dared to have no defense when they entered the &#x2018;Blazing Sky Qi Refining Tower&#x2019; for the first time. Serves them right&#x2026;&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Quickly go and inform the Elder in the tower. If they don&#x2019;t have an Elder supporting them when they enter the &#x2018;Blazing Sky Qi Refining Tower&#x2019; for the first time, it is likely that they will be disintegrated from the inside out.&#x201D;</p><p>Of course, the current Xiao Yan and Wu Hao were naturally unable to hear the words of these older students. They were now feeling shocked and were busy because of the sudden strange situation that had appeared within their bodies.</p><p>&#x201C;Dammit. What exactly is happening?&#x201D;</p><p>Xiao Yan&#x2019;s mind carried some alarm as he eyed a cluster of some strange fire which had absurdly appeared within his body. His heart could not help but become a little flustered. This cluster of flame was so strange that it was a little beyond common sense. There was no other reason except that this cluster of flame was actually formless and invisible. If it were not because of the fact that Xiao Yan was well versed in controlling flames and knew about fire, it was likely that he would not treat this cluster of somewhat twisted and invisible mysterious thing as a kind of flame.</p><p>This cluster of invisible fire seedling was not considered to be overly strong. However, the interior of one&#x2019;s body was ultimately the weakest point of a person&#x2019;s body. In here, even if one was a strong Dou Huang, one would not dare to randomly allow some unknown energy to charge in. As long as a tiny bit of injury occurred in here, the loss that resulted would be difficult to estimate. It might even be permanent.</p><p>Ever since this cluster of invisible flame seedling appeared, the high temperature emitted from it began to cause the veins, bones, muscles, and other various organs in his body to feel piercing pain. Xiao Yan, who frequently played with fire, knew that this was the omen of being incinerated by high temperatures. If he were to continue in this manner, it was likely that not long later, the Qi Paths and other vital parts within his body would lose function under this damn flame. Once his Qi Paths lost their circulatory function, to a practitioner, he would be reduced to a useless person!</p><p>&#x201C;Calm down, calm down!&#x201D;</p><p>Xiao Yan inhaled a deep breath within his heart. He did his best to suppress his somewhat flustered heart that was a result of this sudden situation. A moment later, his mind moved. One could see the green-colored flame was swiftly swarming out from the space of the small Acceptance Spirit in the middle of the vortex. Finally, following Xiao Yan&#x2019;s command, it swiftly passed through one vein after another as it came in all directions in an encirclement manner as it surrounded the invisible flame of unknown origins within it.</p><p>As the &#x2018;Green Lotus Core Flame&#x2019; showed itself, the high temperature, that was seeping out from the invisible flame, was finally completely isolated. At this point, Xiao Yan signed in relief. Fortunately, he had the &#x2018;Green Lotus Core Flame&#x2019; to protect his body.</p><p>&#x201C;This damn thing. How did it enter my body?&#x201D; Xiao Yan began to have doubts after the danger being removed. He did not touch anything after he entered the &#x2018;Blazing Sky Qi Refining Tower&#x2019;. Moreover, there was still Dou Qi that was continuously circulating within his Qi Paths to act as a defense. It was impossible for this wisp of flame to enter into his body without any noise...</p><p>However, seeing the manner in which this strange flame had appeared, it was as though the flame was already in his body rather than barging in from the outside.</p><p>&#x201C;How could it already be present within my body? The &#x2018;Green Lotus Core Flame&#x2019; within my body acts as protection. It should be impossible for ordinary flames to enter!&#x201D; Xiao Yan shook his head and swiftly killed off the thought that flashed in his heart.</p><p>&#x201C;Huh? Invisible flames?&#x201D; Just as Xiao Yan was puzzled despite much pondering, an old surprised voice was suddenly emitted from within his heart.</p><p>&#x201C;Teacher?&#x201D; Xiao Yan was immediately filled with great joy when he heard this voice.</p><p>&#x201C;Invisible and colorless, borrowing the heart to appear, no traces found. This, this&#x2026; this?&#x201D; Yao Lao muttered to himself. A moment later a wild joy surfaced in his shocked voice.</p><p>&#x201C;This is the Fallen Heart Flame?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Fallen Heart Flame?&#x201D; Xiao Yan&#x2019;s mind suddenly trembled. At this instant, he seemed to have an excitement that caused him to be unable to control his emotions. The green-colored flame, which was wrapping around the invisible flame also soared intensely and even nearly caused it to disappear.</p><p>&#x201C;Don&#x2019;t get so excited. Don&#x2019;t get so excited&#x2026; huh?&#x201D;</p><p>Yao Lao hurriedly said in a pacifying manner as he sensed Xiao Yan&#x2019;s agitated heart. He waited until he saw that the green-colored flame had gradually calmed down before he once again placed his attention on that cluster of invisible flame. A moment later, he suddenly emitted a doubtful &#x2018;huh&#x2019; sound.</p><p>&#x201C;What is it? Teacher?&#x201D; Xiao Yan&#x2019;s mind was staring intently at the invisible flame. He hurriedly asked when he heard Yao Lao&#x2019;s surprised &#x2018;huh&#x2019; sound.</p><p>&#x201C;That&#x2019;s not right&#x2026;&#x201D; Yao Lao doubtfully muttered, &#x201C;This kind of form is indeed something displayed by the &#x2018;Fallen Heart Flame,&#x2019; but it should not be so weak&#x2026; yes, yes&#x2026; this wisp of flame&#x2026; does not seem to be from the original body of the &#x2018;Fallen Heart Flame.&#x2019; Instead, it is a split body that was shot into the heart because of one being close to the actual body.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;What do you mean?&#x201D; Xiao Yan was at a greater loss when he heard Yao Lao&#x2019;s words.</p><p>&#x201C;This wisp of invisible flame seedling is not the true &#x2018;Fallen Heart Flame,&#x2019; but merely a split body flame that was shot into your heart by the &#x2018;Fallen Heart Flame.&#x2019; It would not be possible to achieve the effect of evolving the &#x2018;Flame Mantra&#x2019; by swallowing this split body.&#x201D; Yao Lao said in a deep voice.</p><p>Hearing this, Xiao Yan started to understand a little and was immediately very disappointed.</p><p>&#x201C;What is there to be disappointed about? Since the &#x2018;Fallen Heart Flame&#x2019; is able to throw a split body flame into your heart, it means that its distance isn&#x2019;t very far away&#x2026; Moreover, I can also clearly tell you now that the &#x2018;Fallen Heart Flame,&#x2019; which you are pursuing should be within this &#x2018;Blazing Sky Qi Refining Tower!&#x2019; It is really unexpected that the Jia Nan Academy has actually hidden the &#x2018;Heavenly Flame&#x2019; in such a place. No wonder it was so difficult to find.&#x201D; Yao Lao laughed out loud. There was a joy that was difficult to hide within his laughter.</p><p>&#x201C;The &#x2018;Fallen Heart Flame&#x2019; is within this tower?&#x201D; When he heard these words, Xiao Yan, who was a little disappointed moments before, once again became alert.</p><p>&#x201C;This is the only way one can explain why the students of the Inner Academy would be able to train at such rapid speed within this tower.&#x201D; Yao Lao smiled as he explained.</p><p>&#x201C;This is also related to the &#x2018;Fallen Heart Flame?&#x2019;&#x201D; Xiao Yan asked in a startled manner.</p><p>&#x201C;It is naturally related&#x2026; you, remove the &#x2018;Green Lotus Core Flame.&#x2019; Circulate your Dou Qi and pass it through that wisp of invisible flame. Try and see what reaction there will be.&#x201D; Yao Lao instructed.</p><p>Xiao Yan hesitated a little when he heard this. He immediately clenched his teeth and moved his mind. That green-colored flame, which was heavily covering that invisible flame seedling, made a &#x2018;whoosh&#x2019; sound as it swiftly withdrew back into the &#x2018;Acceptance Spirit.&#x2019;</p><p>As the &#x2018;Green Lotus Core Flame&#x2019; left, the high temperature once again spread out from the invisible flame seedling causing a faint piercing pain to be emitted from his Qi Paths and bones.</p><p>Xiao Yan forcefully endured the piercing pain as his mind moved a little. The thumb-sized rhombus shaped Dou Crystal within the vortex trembled slightly. Waves of green-colored Dou Qi swarmed out. Finally, under his control, it passed through a few veins and came to the place where the invisible flame was.</p><p>&#x201C;Pass through it.&#x201D;</p><p>Xiao Yan fiercely gave the order. One could see Dou Qi being abruptly spewed out and immediately rushed through that wisp of invisible flame under the focus of Xiao Yan&#x2019;s mind.</p><p>The size of the invisible flame was extremely small. Hence, it did not even take one second for the green-colored Dou Qi charging into the flame to pass through it and come out from the other side.</p><p>&#x201C;This&#x2026;&#x201D;</p><p>Xiao Yan&#x2019;s mind tightly controlled that green-colored Dou Qi that passed through the invisible flame. He was stunned to realize that the originally strong Dou Qi had actually shrunk to nearly half its size after passing through the interior of the invisible flame!</p><p>While it may have shrunk to half its size, the green-colored Dou Qi, which had become much smaller, gave Xiao Yan a somewhat condensed and real feeling. This kind of feeling was as though the invisible flame had twisted the somewhat scattered Dou Qi tightly together after the Dou Qi passed through it. With this, the energy that the Dou Qi, whose size had become smaller, could emit was definitely even greater than that turbulent Dou Qi from earlier!</p><p>Xiao Yan could not help but rejoice as he clearly sensed this kind of change within his Dou Qi. He hurriedly controlled his Dou Qi as it continuously passed through that wisp of invisible flame. However, just as the fifth string of Dou Qi passed through it, the wisp of invisible flame began to quiver a little. Quickly following this, the flame became even more illusionary. Its temperature became increasingly lower. A moment later, it finally completely disappeared silently, in a manner similar to when it appeared.</p><p>&#x201C;It disappeared?&#x201D;</p><p>Xiao Yan could not help but feel stunned as the Dou Qi passed through empty space. He could sense that the hot feeling in his body had already began to swiftly become faint.</p><p>&#x201C;This is a cluster of extremely weak split body that was thrown into you. The purification energy that it created is very small. Hence, it can only support you purifying Dou Qi.&#x201D; Yao Lao smiled as he replied, removing the doubt that Xiao Yan had.</p><p>Xiao Yan finally came to a sudden understanding as he heard this. He shook his head somewhat pitifully. His mind moved and he once again poured the few strands of Dou Qi, which had been purified, into the Dou Crystal within the vortex.</p><p>As his mind looked at the rhombus shaped Dou Crystal, Xiao Yan realized that after the bit of purified Dou Qi was poured into the Dou Crystal, the thumb-sized Dou Crystal appeared to have become slightly larger...</p><p>&#x201C;This &#x2018;Fallen Heart Flame&#x2019; actually has such a mysterious effect. Just a mere cluster of weak split body flame that was thrown out was able to slightly enhance my Dou Qi. If I can swallow the original body then&#x2026;&#x201D; Xiao Yan swallowed a mouthful of saliva when he thought of this. His heart could not resist leaping intensely. This &#x2018;Fallen Heart Flame&#x2019; was an accelerator that could increase the speed of one&#x2019;s training. The training speed of whoever was able to obtain it would likely enter a kind of extremely frightening stage!</p><p>&#x201C;Why? Little fellow, are you interested?&#x201D; Yao Lao teasing voice sounded.</p><p>Xiao Yan smiled and did not even hide the slightest bit of yearning in his heart.</p><p>&#x201C;Teacher, the benefits that &#x2018;Fallen Heart Flame&#x2019; can bring me might well be even greater than the &#x2018;Green Lotus Core Flame.&#x2019; Hence&#x2026; no matter what happens, I must definitely obtain it!&#x201D;</p>
