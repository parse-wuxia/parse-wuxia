<p><strong><u>Chapter 1214: Obtaining Information</u></strong></p><p>Xiao Yan faintly grinned as he watched the green-faced Yi Chen throw up a mouthful of fresh blood. Xiao Yan&#x2019;s finger gently rubbed a blood-colored Storage Ring in his hand. This was something that he had snatched from Yi Chen&#x2019;s finger when they had exchanged blows earlier. Since the other party had cursed Xiao Yan and had lost the battle, it was natural that the other party would have to leave something behind.</p><p>&#x201C;Hand over the Storage Ring!&#x201D;</p><p>Yi Chen rubbed away the blood trace on the corner of his mouth. His eyes were scarlet as he stared at Xiao Yan. His fierce manner was just like that of a wild beast.</p><p>&#x201C;Treat this as a little interest.&#x201D; Xiao Yan laughed softly before speaking in a calm voice, &#x201C;You have already lost this stage match. Take your people and leave.&#x201D;</p><p>Yi Chen&#x2019;s face was distorted. His eyes were dark and ruthless as he stared at Xiao Yan. The desire to kill surged within his eyes. Clearly, he was unwilling to simply admit defeat. From the way he saw it, the reason he had lost to Xiao Yan was because he had made a mistake in the way he had attacked. If he had been prepared, he would not have ended up defeated in such an ugly fashion.</p><p>A denseness also surged onto the face of Chen Tian Nan while Yi Chen&#x2019;s face was green. He had underestimated Xiao Yan. It was unexpected that even Demon Yi from the Profound Sky Sect, whose reputation was extremely fierce, would end up being defeated by Xiao Yan&#x2019;s hands. Looking at it this way, Xiao Yan could be considered outstanding even among the younger generation across the Central Plains region.</p><p>Moreover, no one would forget this young man, who had defeated Yi Chen, also possessed superb alchemist abilities that surpassed many Elders within the Pill Tower.</p><p>Although Xiao Yan was not the only one who had managed to obtain such results in both Dou Qi and alchemist skills, he was definitely an extremely rare existence by being able to reach this stage at such a young age.</p><p>&#x201C;This person must not be allowed to live. Otherwise, he will definitely cause trouble in the future.&#x201D;</p><p>A dense killing intent flashed across Chen Tian Nan&#x2019;s heart. His eyes were rotated as he suddenly stepped forward. With a flash, his body had appeared around ten feet in front of Xiao Yan. A cold cry exploded within the square like thunder. &#x201C;Uneducated brat. You actually snatched someone else&#x2019;s thing when sparring. Did your teach not teach you the necessary etiquette?&#x201D;</p><p>Chen Tian Nan&#x2019;s large hand penetrated through empty space after his cry sounded. He mercilessly grabbed at Xiao Yan&#x2019;s head. Looking at this situation, Xiao Yan&#x2019;s head would burst apart with a &#x2018;bang&#x2019; like a watermelon if it was firmly grabbed by him.</p><p>&#x201C;Chen Tian Nan!&#x201D;</p><p>Qiu Ling&#x2019;s expression changed as he stood outside of the stone stage. He yelled Chen Tian Nan&#x2019;s name in anger.</p><p>Chen Tian Nan acted as though he did not hear the furious cry of Qiu Ling. At this moment, his desire to kill Xiao Yan had already reached a peak. If he did not personally kill Xiao Yan today, it was likely that he would have difficulty sleeping and eating in peace in the future.</p><p>&#x201C;Brat, repay my son&#x2019;s life!&#x201D;</p><p>Chen Tian Nan revealed a ferocious face. Just when his palm was about to make contact with Xiao Yan, a cold smile surfaced on Xiao Yan&#x2019;s face. Xiao Yan flicked his finger and a dark-golden figure suddenly appeared in front of him.</p><p>&#x201C;Clang!&#x201D;</p><p>Chen Tian Nan&#x2019;s hand heavily slammed into the dark-golden body. A clear metallic sound appeared. The frightening destructive force on his hand did not cause the golden body to shake even a little.</p><p>Chen Tian Nan&#x2019;s palm fell. Waves of a numbing feeling were suddenly transmitted from his palm, causing his expression to immediately change. He raised his eyes, only to see an expressionless hole of a face. After which, the figure&#x2019;s dark-golden fist scattered the air. A punch without any fancy moves smashed toward Chen Tian Nan&#x2019;s head.</p><p>Faced with this bright-golden fist, the pores all over Chen Tian Nan&#x2019;s body suddenly stood up. His mighty Dou Qi gathered on his palm as it hurriedly met with the fist.</p><p>&#x201C;Bang!&#x201D;</p><p>A low, deep sound appeared in the air as an invisible wind fluctuation spread out with lightning-like speed. The stone stage, which had turned into rock fragments, burst apart and formed a layer of dust on the ground.</p><p>The fist and palm crossed each other. One could watch as Chen Tian Nan immediately flew backwards. He quickly landed, and his feet took over a dozen heavy steps back. Only then did he raise his head in shock and look at the dark-golden puppet in front of Xiao Yan. The waves of numbness being transmitted from his hand caused a monstrous wave to surge in his heart. With his eyesight, he was naturally able to tell that the dark-golden human figure was a puppet. However, the strength of this puppet&#x2026; caused his entire body to feel an icy-chill.</p><p>A Dou Zun class puppet?</p><p>Chen Tian Nan felt a dryness surging into his mouth when he thought of this. An ordinary person was unable to reach this stage even after training for all one&#x2019;s life. However, a puppet of this fellow actually possessed such a frightening strength?</p><p>&#x201C;Clang clang!&#x201D;</p><p>Chen Tian Nan withdrew in a deflated manner. The group of experts from the Profound Xuan Sect immediately drew shiny weapons from their Storage Rings. Their faces were filled with murderous desire as they stared at Xiao Yan. From their appearance, it seemed that they would charge forward and turn Xiao Yan into mincemeat once Chen Tian Nan gave the order.</p><p>&#x201C;Swoosh!&#x201D;</p><p>Two figures slowly appeared beside Xiao Yan while these people drew their weapons. Their ice-cold eyes swept over the square. The vast and mighty Dou Qi that vaguely spread from them caused these fierce, evil people to withdraw two steps in shock.</p><p>&#x201C;Two Dou Zuns?&#x201D;</p><p>The ones who had appeared beside Xiao Yan were naturally the Little Fairy Doctor and Tian Huo zun-zhe. The two of them had not intervened earlier because they were aware that Xiao Yan could deal with the so-called Demon Yi. However, they had not expected Chen Tian Nan to suddenly attack.</p><p>Chen Tian Nan&#x2019;s face underwent a slight change as he watched the Little Fairy Doctor and Tian Huo zun-zhe appear. He was naturally able to sense the strengths of the two. They were genuine Dou Zuns. Moreover, the most frightening thing was that the young, beautiful, white-clothed lady vaguely gave him a dangerous feeling when he looked at her.</p><p>Additionally, the thing that really caused his heart to sink was the Sky Demon Puppet that stood in front of Xiao Yan without moving. After the earlier exchange, Chen Tian Nan clearly understood in his heart that if they were to really fight, just the puppet alone was going to give him a difficult time.</p><p>&#x201C;This brat is really mysterious. There are so many experts beside him. Even without the protection of the Pill Tower, these people who have come today wouldn&#x2019;t be able to do anything to them.&#x201D;</p><p>Chen Tian Nan&#x2019;s mouth twitched a little. After weighing the situation repeatedly, his face became green. He realized that the people he had brought would likely be killed by the other party should a battle really break out. Three elite Dou Zuns. Even with the great foundation of his Profound Xuan Sect, he was unable to produce a lineup that could compare to it.</p><p>Faced with this sudden change in situation, Chen Tian Nan ended up feeling a little embarrassed. His group was unable to fight with the other party. What could he do?</p><p>Yi Chen&#x2019;s expression had also changed because of this scene. Although there were very few people among the younger generation who could surpass him, he still had to hold back his arrogance in the face of an expert Dou Zun. The peak of the Dou Zong class and the Dou Zun class were two completely different concepts. It was difficult to measure their gap.</p><p>Currently, three elite Dou Zuns had suddenly appeared by Xiao Yan&#x2019;s side. It was likely that Chen Tian Nan&#x2019;s aim in maneuvering such a large number of people was not going to be fulfilled.</p><p>Any words were useless in front of true strength. If they had been able to take out ten elite Dou Zuns, there was no need for them to even say anything. They could simply attack and capture Xiao Yan. Unfortunately, the number of Dou Zuns they currently had not only was not ten but was even a little less compared to Xiao Yan&#x2019;s side. How were they going to fight?</p><p>&#x201C;Sect Leader Chen, you have made enough of a fuss today. If this continues, it is likely that even the three association heads will not be able to overlook this matter!&#x201D;</p><p>Qiu Ling&#x2019;s expression was dark and solemn. Chen Tian Nan had come to create trouble at the entrance of the Pill Tower. It would not benefit the Pill Tower if word of this spread. However, it was fortunate that Xiao Yan was full of abilities. Not only did he successfully withstand this calamity, but he had even violently slapped the Profound Xuan Sect.</p><p>Chen Tian Nan&#x2019;s expression slightly changed upon hearing Qiu Ling&#x2019;s words. The eyes of Yi Chen became cold as he spoke in a dense chilly voice, &#x201C;Could it be that Elder Qiu thinks that it is so easy to take the things of my Profound Sky Sect?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;This is called the spoils of a fight.&#x201D; Xiao Yan smiled and corrected. His smiling face caused Yi Chen&#x2019;s eyes to appear as though they were about to spit out flames.</p><p>&#x201C;Brat, you better not use the glib of tongue on the old me&#x2026;&#x201D; Chen Tian Nan coldly laughed. However, before he could finish speaking, an ice-cold voice suddenly resounded over the entire square.</p><p>&#x201C;Sect leader Chen, it is time that this farce ends today. If you continue with your trouble, you should not blame the Pill Tower for not giving you face. Moreover, Yi Chen, if you represent the Profound Sky Sect as enemies of the Pill Tower, you can return immediately. I want to see just how Tian Ming Zi will reply to you!&#x201D;</p><p>The space in front of Xiao Yan slowly distorted when that icy-cold voice sounded. Immediately Xuan Yi slowly walked out of the distortion. Her eyes contained a fierceness. There was an incredible amount of prestige in her stare.</p><p>Qiu Ling by the side hurriedly bowed and greeted Xuan Yi when he saw her appearing at this moment. The faces of Chen Tian Nan and Yi Chen drastically changed. Xuan Yi&#x2019;s status and reputation far surpassed theirs. Even if the chief of the Profound Sky Sect, Tian Ming Zi, were here, it was likely that he would have to be polite to her. In an instant, even someone as proud as Yi Chen felt perspiration pouring down like rain. He might have spoken in a mighty manner earlier, but he also understood that the Profound Sky Sect would definitely not offend the Pill Tower over Xiao Yan&#x2026;</p><p>&#x201C;Since association head Xuan Yi has stepped forward, the matter today shall end here for now. However, if the old me discovers the truth, I will definitely not just leave the matter as it is.&#x201D;</p><p>The mouth of Chen Tian Nan trembled for a moment. Finally, he clenched his teeth and threw out some ruthless but superficial words. He then swung his sleeve and directed his group to leave in a dispirited manner. He did not expect even a giant head of the Pill Tower to personally step forward because of a Xiao Yan.</p><p>Watching Chen Tian Nan withdraw, Yi Chen could only grit his teeth unwillingly. His eyes were dark and dense as he glanced at Xiao Yan. After which, he swung his sleeves and left. His back was accompanied by a miserable appearance.</p><p>Xiao Yan involuntarily shook his head as he watched these people leave in a dispirited manner. He tossed the blood-red Storage Ring in his hand and spoke with a faint smile, &#x201C;A group of people who only knows how to bully others by using another&#x2019;s strength&#x2026;&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Why did you show yourself in the face of such matters? Qiu Ling would naturally have helped you avoid them&#x2026;&#x201D; Xuan Yi turned around and involuntarily reprimanded Xiao Yan.</p><p>&#x201C;The other party even set up a battle stage and issued a challenge. Could I shrink back?&#x201D; Xiao Yan laughed.</p><p>&#x201C;Forget it, I&#x2019;m too lazy to argue with you. Your character is the same as that old fellow&#x2026;&#x201D; Xuan Yi helplessly shook her head. She turned around and walked to the Pill Tower. When passing by Xiao Yan, a soft voice was transmitted into his ear.</p><p>&#x201C;Come in. We have obtained information related to the place where Yao Chen is imprisoned&#x2026;&#x201D;</p><p>The smile on Xiao Yan&#x2019;s face slowly disappeared when he heard her words. Replacing it was a stern, densely cold face.</p>
