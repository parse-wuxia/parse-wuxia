<p><strong><u>Chapter 745: Pill Formed</u></strong></p><p>The purple-colored glow on the surface of the light cocoon alternated between bright and dark. It was just like the beating of a heart and possessed a rhythm. If a person with sharp senses was present, he would be able to sense that each time the glow on the light cocoon changed, the natural energy within the valley would slightly fluctuate. The great amount of energy would be absorbed into the light cocoon, causing the light on the body of the cocoon to become even brighter.</p><p>Medusa was seated cross-legged on a huge rock not far from the light cocoon. Her gaze was focused intently on the activity of the light cocoon. It was a long while later before she relaxed a little. She turned her gaze and observed the mountain cave under the mountain wall where a rich pill fragrance continued to flow out of. She helplessly shook her head. It had been a month since Xiao Yan had entered the cave to refine medicinal pills. However, from the looks of it, it seemed that there was no sign of it ending. At the same time, Zi Yan ceased having any other response after transforming into a light cocoon three days ago. She was repeatedly absorbing the surrounding natural energy every day. However, there was not the slightest change in her body. Looking at this situation, it seemed that the time that Zi Yan needed to advance would likely not be short.</p><p>One person was refining pills while another had transformed into a cocoon to advance her rank. In this way, only Medusa was guarding this mountain valley. She was naturally somewhat bored because of this. However, Xiao Yan and Zi Yan could not be distracted at this moment. Should they be disturbed during this period of time, the problems could be disastrous. Hence, she could only guard this valley all day. Even when she occasionally left the place, she had try her best to hurry back as soon as possible. This kind of dull guarding caused her to feel extremely helpless.</p><p>This kind of dull guarding continued for around five days before it was broken by an unusual activity transmitted from the mountain cave.</p><p>On this day, Medusa was still training with her eyes shut as she had always done. She naturally diverted some of her attention to the light cocoon while she was training. It was at this moment that the cave, which had been silent, suddenly emitted an earth-shaking explosion. The entire valley shook under this explosion.</p><p>Medusa opened her eyes in shock. She looked at the cave, only to see that smoke was repeatedly escaping from the cave. Immediately, a somewhat miserable figure slowly walked out from it while letting out an intense cough.</p><p>Xiao Yan walked out of the cave which was permeated with smoke. The glaring sunlight that scattered down from the sky caused Xiao Yan to instinctively cover his eyes. After getting used to it for a moment, he finally opened his eyes, lowered his head, and looked at his tattered clothes. He could not help but let out a bitter laugh. The medicinal effect of this &#x2018;Mighty Huang Pill&#x2019; was too overbearing. The refining process was filled with wild and violent medicinal strength. If one were even a little careless during this refinement, one would cause the medicinal pill to self-detonate. The might of this kind of explosion was quite strong and was comparable to a strike with the full force of an expert Dou Wang. When Xiao Yan was refining this pill during his few attempts earlier, he would swiftly scatter the flame the moment the medicinal strength within the medicinal pill showed signs of being unstable. Although this would cause the medicinal ingredients in the cauldron to be destroyed, it was at least superior in terms of it being safe. Little trouble had occurred during the few attempts of Xiao Yan to refine the &#x2018;Mighty Huang Pill&#x2019; under such extreme caution.</p><p>A couple of days ago, the three &#x2018;Mighty Huang Pills&#x2019; that Xiao Yan needed had been successfully refined by Xiao Yan. In order to refine these three &#x2018;Mighty Huang Pills&#x2019;, Xiao Yan was basically left with hardly any of the medicinal ingredients that he had prepared. Despite this, Xiao Yan&#x2019;s aim this time around had been achieved. While he was sighing in relief, he saw these remaining medicinal ingredients and a thought struck him. He wanted to help himself refine a &#x2018;Mighty Huang Pill&#x2019; for future use. The problem laid here. Due to there being only enough medicinal ingredients to refine one &#x2018;Mighty Huang Pill&#x2019;, Xiao Yan was unwilling to waste this last set of medicinal ingredients when the medicinal pill once again showed signs of violent activity while it was being refined. After which, he forcefully tried to refine it. Of course, the final result was naturally the earth-shaking explosion he created...</p><p>If the extraordinary crimson cauldron had not blocked most of the force from this big explosion, it was likely that Xiao Yan would not merely be facing the problem of his clothes being shattered.</p><p>Xiao Yan felt somewhat lucky when he thought of this. His defense at that time was not strong. If he were to be struck by this enormous force head-on, it was likely that he would add new injuries to the old injuries on this body of his.</p><p>Xiao Yan wiped the ashes off his face with his sleeve before sweeping his eyes over the valley. After which, he paused with surprise on the enormous purple-colored light cocoon that was extremely eye-catching. It was only a moment later before he turned his gaze toward Medusa by the side. He asked, &#x201C;This is?&#x201D;</p><p>Medusa was also startled when she saw the miserable appearance of Xiao Yan. She immediately smiled a little and responded softly, &#x201C;This is Zi Yan&#x2019;s transformation.&#x201D;</p><p>Xiao Yan was surprised upon hearing this. He rejoiced a moment later, &#x201C;She is about to advance her rank?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;That should be the case. However, it has been a couple of days since she has transformed into a cocoon, but there is no activity even until now. It seems that this advancement will require quite some time.&#x201D; Medusa nodded as she replied.</p><p>Xiao Yan smiled but was not surprised. In most cases, a Magical Beast required quite a long time to advance. Moreover, Zi Yan&#x2019;s original form was not an ordinary being. It was naturally a little more difficult for her to evolve.</p><p>&#x201C;Have you succeeded in your medicinal pill refinement?&#x201D; Medusa&#x2019;s pretty eyes swept over Xiao Yan as she asked.</p><p>&#x201C;Yes.&#x201D; Xiao Yan nodded. He immediately laughed bitterly, &#x201C;However, I was a little greedy. Otherwise, I would not have ended up in this state.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Your aura is also becoming increasingly unstable. It is alternating between being strong and weak. There is also a faint feeling of the Dou Qi within your body seeping out. Looks like you should be breaking away from the Dou Wang class very soon.&#x201D; Medusa&#x2019;s eyes paused on Xiao Yan&#x2019;s body. She sensed the powerful Dou Qi that seeped out from the latter&#x2019;s body while she spoke in surprise.</p><p>&#x201C;Soon. The pill refinement this time around did benefit me quite a bit. According to my estimation, this moment will arrive within ten days.&#x201D; Xiao Yan smiled. His eyes also contained a gratification.</p><p>&#x201C;The gap between a Dou Wang and a Dou Huang is extremely large. Normally speaking, even if one possessed the strength to breakthrough, one would require half a year or even a year in order to truly be able to undergo the transformation. Looks like you will need to undertake a deep retreat next.&#x201D; Medusa lowered her eyes and slowly replied.</p><p>Xiao Yan nodded slightly. He was also aware that his retreat this time around might be quite long.</p><p>&#x201C;The pill refinement this time around only lasted for a month. I think that the person that big brother has sent has already reached the place where I indicated we would meet. I will return to undertake a deep retreat once I deliver the medicinal pills. I will not leave this retreat until I breakthrough to the Dou Huang class!&#x201D; Xiao Yan laughed faintly. His hand gently touched the white fire seal on his forehead. He only sighed in relief after sensing the faint warmth that was being emitted from the fire seal. He muttered in his heart, &#x201C;Teacher, wait for me. Your disciple will raise his strength as quickly as possible and rescue both you and father!&#x201D;</p><p>Medusa nodded while she observed the dark chill that had flashed across Xiao Yan&#x2019;s eyes. She randomly said, &#x201C;Relax. I will help protect you while I am watching Zi Yan.&#x201D;</p><p>Xiao Yan smiled when he heard this. He immediately cupped his hands toward Medusa and softly laughed, &#x201C;Since this is the case, I shall give you my thanks. I will deliver the medicinal pills first, and will begin my deep retreat after a short rest upon my return.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Yes.&#x201D; Medusa eyes turned to the light cocoon. Her clean nose that stuck out emitted a slight sound.</p><p>Xiao Yan did not say anything more when he saw this. He walked one round around the light cocoon. Only after discovering that there was nothing wrong did he put down the worry in his heart. He leaped up and flew out of the valley by himself.</p><p>Xiao Yan&#x2019;s figure paused in the sky after leaving the valley. His gaze looked in all directions. After identifying his bearings, the fire wings on his back were flapped and he transformed into a ray of light that flew toward the northern sky in a lightning-like manner.</p><p>This flight continued for a moment before Xiao Yan slowed down. He swept his gaze around before immediately pausing it on a mountain peak. There was the faint trace of humans moving about at that spot.</p><p>With a thought, Xiao Yan appeared above that mountain peak within a couple of breaths. He had just appeared when he sensed the ten plus auras on the mountain peak below suddenly become extremely faint.</p><p>&#x201C;Show yourselves.&#x201D; Xiao Yan glanced over as he softly commanded.</p><p>A commotion was immediately emitted from the mountain peak the moment Xiao Yan&#x2019;s voice sounded. Dozens of figures flashed and appeared immediately. An old man who was leading them looked at Xiao Yan in the sky. Joy surfaced on his old face as both of his kneels fell to the ground and he respectfully said, &#x201C;Greetings Chief.&#x201D;</p><p>The dozens of people behind the old man orderly feel on both knees. An orderly deep sound resounded over the mountain forest.</p><p>Xiao Yan&#x2019;s gaze swept over these people. Finally, his eyes paused on their chests. There was a jade-green badge was present there, and an exquisite fire lotus was drawn on the badge.</p><p>Xiao Yan slowly landed as he asked indifferently, &#x201C;Are you people the one&#x2019;s whom Big Brother sent?&#x201D;</p><p>The old man quickly bowed and stepped forward when he heard this. He took out a scroll from his storage ring and handed it over with both hands while speaking respectfully, &#x201C;Chief, this old man is called Bai Lisheng. I am currently the deacon of the Yan Alliance. I was indeed dispatched by Elder Xiao Ding this time around.&#x201D;</p><p>Xiao Yan received the scroll and slowly scanned it. Only then did he nod slightly while he smiled with a deeper meaning, &#x201C;I will trouble you then. I still have some matters to do and cannot return to the capital. Hence, your group will be responsible for escorting these things back. There is my Spiritual Imprint within these things. I will naturally have the ability to find them should you have the misfortune of being robbed along the way.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Ke ke, chief, you can rest assured. There is really no one within this Jia Ma Empire who would dare touch the things that belong to our &#x2018;Yan Alliance&#x2019;.&#x201D; Bai Li Sheng hurriedly nodded and replied. He was naturally clearly aware of the other meaning within Xiao Yan&#x2019;s words.</p><p>&#x201C;Yes. Since that is the case, you should hurry up and leave. Inform Big Brother after you return that I will be undertaking a retreat for half a year or a year. Tell him to make the decisions for all the matters of the Yan Alliance during this period of time.&#x201D; Xiao Yan waved his hand and commanded.</p><p>&#x201C;Yes!&#x201D;</p><p>A respectful response was emitted within a fifty kilometer radius. The old man immediately withdrew. Only after he withdrew a couple of dozens of meters did he wave his hand and led a few dozen people, who were quite strong, into the forest in a well trained manner. Finally, they swiftly left the mountain under the cover of the sea of trees.</p><p>Xiao Yan sent off this group of escorts with his eyes. He nodded slightly. The strongest person among them was that old man who was at the peak of the Dou Ling class. However, their overall quality still caused Xiao Yan to be satisfied.</p><p>&#x201C;Since I have already settled the matter about the medicinal pills, the next thing I need to do is to return and undertake the deep retreat&#x2026;&#x201D; Xiao Yan softly mumbled. His body had just risen into the sky and was about to return to the valley when a sudden soft &#x2018;what&#x2019; sounded. His eyes swept toward a spot that was over fifty kilometers away. A Spiritual Imprint that he had left behind was being transmitted from there.</p><p>&#x201C;That place is&#x2026;&#x201D; Xiao Yan&#x2019;s eyes flickered slightly. A moment later, he whispered, &#x201C;Qingshan Town&#x2026;&#x201D;</p>
