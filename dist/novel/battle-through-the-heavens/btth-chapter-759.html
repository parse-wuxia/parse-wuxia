<p><strong><u>Chapter 759: Big Battle!</u></strong></p><p>The vast, endless plains possessed two towering mountain ranges that stood with their peaks piercing the sky. Such a tall mountain range was a place that an ordinary person would have difficulty climbing. An incomparably huge fortress guarded the gap between these two mountain ranges like a fierce prehistoric beast, protecting the main road that lead into and out of the Jia Ma Empire. This fortress was the most important defensive line in the hearts of the people of the Jia Ma Empire. If this defensive line was torn apart, the three empires armies would march straight into the Jia Ma Empire!</p><p>The size of the fortress was so large that it left one speechless. Compared to the Zhen Gui Pass that Xiao Yan had visited back then, it was undoubtedly a junior meeting a senior. The walls of this fortress was completely built from the dark-black volcanic rock. It had an unusually frightening toughness. Such a wall would likely be able to hold out for a long time even against the attacks of an elite Dou Huang.</p><p>Densely packed soldiers could be seen all over the fortress&#x2019; wall. There were also countless number of enormous ballistas faintly present. Steel arrows that were as thick as one&#x2019;s thigh had been loaded onto the ballistas and were ready to unleash a frightening strength at any moment. This defensive line was worthy of being as firm as metal under the protection of a countless number of soldiers. Even the three empire alliance would have to pay a hefty and bloody price in order to forcefully attack and tear this defensive line apart.</p><p>Over ten human figures with quite a great reputation within the empire stood on the middle of the city wall. At this moment, their gazes carried a thread of worry as they looked at an extremely far spot from the fortress. Densely packed armies rolled out like dark clouds from that spot. At a glance, one could see an endless number of them. From the looks of the large flags that the armies carried, they were the alliance military from the three large empires.</p><p>Of course, the thing that caused them the most worry was not these ordinary soldiers. Instead it was the three elite Dou Zongs who were hidden within the army. In the eyes of a truly strong person, an ordinary army did not pose much of a threat. As long as one was an expert Dou Wang, one would be able to easily defend against a ten thousand man strong army. This was also the reason why the strong possessed a position that exceeded that of royalty on this continent!</p><p>The strong reigned supreme in the Dou Qi continent. Royal authority was second!</p><p>&#x201C;Ugh, I heard that the ones who have led everyone over this time around are Yan Luo Tian and the three Elders from the Mulan Valley&#x2026; although the most troublesome Sect Leader of the Poison Sect will not appear, this is already enough to feel an extremely great pressure. After all, this is equivalent to two elite Dou Zongs.&#x201D; Hai Bodong&#x2019;s gaze stared into the distance for a moment before withdrawing it and sighing.</p><p>The current Hai Bodong had truly reached the peak of the Dou Huang class where he was comparable to Jia Lao after the repeated big fights during the past year. Breaking through to the Dou Zong class was only one step away. Of course, the distance of this one step was such that it was an ordinary thing for one to be unable to cross in one&#x2019;s lifetime if one did not have the opportunity. After all, there were an unknown number of people on the Dou Qi continent who had ended up stopping at this stage.</p><p>Despite this, a Dou Huang was ultimately a Dou Huang. Unless one possessed some unusual abnormal Dou Skills, it was basically impossible to leap across the class and challenge an elite Dou Zong. After all, not everyone was like Xiao Yan. He not only possessed the mysterious &#x2018;Flame Mantra&#x2019; Qi Method but also unique treasures like three &#x2018;Heavenly Flames&#x2019; and the &#x2018;God Seal Skill&#x2019;.</p><p>&#x201C;I have already dispatched some people to the &#x2018;Black-Corner Region&#x2019; to search for Second Brother. He will definitely come and lend a hand if he receives the news. However&#x2026; a distant water source cannot quench one&#x2019;s immediate thirst. It is likely going to be a different situation by the time he leads people over.&#x201D; Xiao Ding, who was seated on a wheelchair, softly sighed. During this period of time, he had spent a great amount of effort and thought in order to deal with the attacks of the three sects. However, the other party had people who were equivalent to three elite Dou Zongs. This was ultimately a huge weight that was pressing on the hearts of everyone in the Jia Ma Empire.</p><p>&#x201C;Your Majesty, are your injuries alright?&#x201D; Xiao Ding&#x2019;s hand patted gently on his wheelchair before he turned his head to look at the cold pretty face of the bewitching lady beside him. Her moving appearance was indeed a rare beauty in this kind of place that was filled with blood and killing.</p><p>Perhaps it was due to Xiao Ding&#x2019;s relationship with someone but the coldness on Medusa&#x2019;s bewitching face, which was staring into the distance with cold eyes, slowly became warmer. She said, &#x201C;I have consumed the medicinal pill that the Yan Alliance alchemists have refined and recovered quite a bit. Although my fighting strength is slightly weakened, there are no serious problems.&#x201D;</p><p>Xiao Ding laughed bitterly and nodded slightly. He said, &#x201C;It&#x2019;s been tough on you.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;I am also thinking of the Snake-People Race. Now that everyone&#x2019;s relationship is one where the death of anyone will cause the other to suffer, the losses from any single side will result in a destructive end.&#x201D; Medusa shook her head. She turned her head slightly as her eyes looked toward the distant Magical Beast Mountain Range. She clenched her silver teeth and sighed within her heart, &#x201C;Have you not come out of your retreat? If you are a little later, it is likely that the Jia Ma Empire will really be destroyed&#x2026;&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Ugh, I wonder how third brother doing. His retreat actually took an entire year. It is best that no accident has happened to him&#x2026;.&#x201D; Xiao Ding also understood what Medusa was thinking when he saw her gaze. He rubbed his forehead and bitterly laughed.</p><p>&#x201C;This little bastard always plays it like this&#x2026; if he does not return soon, this Yan Alliance will be finished.&#x201D; Hai Bodong by his side could not resist opening his mouth to speak when he heard Xiao Ding&#x2019;s words.</p><p>&#x201C;I think it should be soon. As long as we are able to endure until he comes out from his retreat, the situation will be much better. After all, that fellow may be a Dou Huang but if he unleashes his full strength, he is able to contend against an elite Dou Zong. At that time, our side will have two elite Dou Zongs. Even the people from the three sects would not dare to act rashly. If we were to really go into an all out fight, this Queen would at the very least be able to drag one of them down even if I end up dying!&#x201D; Medusa voiced her thoughts. A dense chill immediately flashed across her pupils.</p><p>&#x201C;That Sect Leader of the Poison Sect, Yan Luo Tian from the Gold Geese Sect, and the three Elders from the Mulan Valley are afraid that you will do this. Hence, they have not been engaging in a deathmatch with you. However, this time, it is likely that they have made preparations when they join hands. Your Majesty, you should be more careful.&#x201D; Jia Xing Tian by the other side spoke in a deep voice while wearing a respectful expression.</p><p>Medusa nodded slightly. She was about to speak when a thunder-like drumbeat began to spread over from far away in a mighty manner. It immediately affected the entire fortress.</p><p>&#x201C;They are about to begin their attack!&#x201D; The expressions of Medusa and the others were tense as they heard this hurried drumbeat.</p><p>The ground began to tremble not long after the drumbeat sounded. The enormous endless sea of people in the distance began to rush over toward the fortress like ocean waves. The orderly bang as their feet landed on the ground resounded over this place like a thunderous roar, giving people a heavy feeling within their hearts.</p><p>&#x201C;All the experts Dou Wangs from the Yan Alliance and the Snake-People Race, spread yourself all over the defensive lines. Tightly guard against the enemy&#x2019;s expert Dou Wangs!&#x201D; Xiao Ding&#x2019;s expression gradually became solemn as he turned his head and spoke in a stern manner.</p><p>A large number of people responded behind him upon hearing the order. Immediately, numerous human figures flew out in a lightning-like manner.</p><p>&#x201C;Everyone, today&#x2019;s big battle affects the survival of our Jia Ma Empire and the Snake-People Race. Therefore, let&#x2019;s go all out!&#x201D; Xiao Ding&#x2019;s gaze slowly swept over everyone as he spoke in a deep voice.</p><p>Everyone nodded their heads heavily with a solemn expression when they heard his words. This battle concerned their survival!</p><p>While the fortress entered into a battle ready mode, the black masses of human heads began to flood over amid the loud battle cries that soared to the sky. Numerous rays of light flew through the air above this sea of people. These were the experts from the three sects, the figures who caused the pressure on the Black Mountain Fortress to soar.</p><p>When the endless black masses of human flow were still around a thousand meters from the fortress, a killing aura surged to the sky with a loud stomping sound. It spread out before covering the entire Black Mountain Fortress into it!</p><p>The rays of light flew across in the sky while numerous people with Dou Qi wings on their backs appeared. Their gazes carried cold smiles as they observed the tightly guarded Black Mountain Fortress.</p><p>&#x201C;Ke ke, it is really unexpected that your Jia Ma Empire is so stubborn. You are actually able to endure for nearly a year in the face of our three empire alliance. Even though your Jia Ma Empire will be completely defeated in this battle, your Jia Ma Empire&#x2019;s reputation could be considered to have soared in this northwestern region.&#x201D; A powerful wild laugh suddenly sounded while the armies faced each other. Finally, it resounded over the sky.</p><p>&#x201C;Yan Luo Tian!&#x201D; The face of Medusa and the others in the fortress immediately turned cold upon hearing the laughter. Their mouths spat out a name that was incomparably prestigious within the Luo Yan Empire.</p><p>A bright golden glow suddenly shot into the sky from the large army after the laughter sounded. It immediately stayed suspended in the sky. Everyone&#x2019;s eyes drifted over, only to see a man who was wearing golden clothes floating in the sky. A pair of unusually large gold-colored goose wings flickered, appearing much like a divine being.</p><p>The black masses of soldiers immediately erupted into an earth-shaking cheer when this gold-clothed man appeared. Clearly, this Yan Luo Tian possessed an extremely high reputation among them.</p><p>Medusa&#x2019;s face was icy-cold as she looked at Yan Luo Tian. Her body moved and she was already in the sky outside of the fortress the next time she appeared. Her gaze swept over Yan Luo Tian only to laugh, &#x201C;A mere two star Dou Zong also dares to act presumptuous in front of this Queen?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Hee hee, Medusa&#x2019;s beauty has been spread among a number of countries around. You really live up to your reputation. This ancestor (refer to himself as a Dou Zong) knows that I alone will be no match for you. Hence, I am naturally not intending to fight alone&#x2026;&#x201D; A cold smile surfaced on the corner of Yan Luo Tian&#x2019;s mouth as he slowly spoke.</p><p>&#x201C;Ha ha, you are indeed worthy of being Queen Medusa. You are really a hero among women. Today, allow the three of us and the Geese Sect&#x2019;s Leader to exchange blows with you&#x2026;&#x201D; Three different rays of light shot out from the army below just after Yan Luo Tian&#x2019;s voice sounded. Finally, three smiling Elders appeared in the air.</p><p>Medusa&#x2019;s eyes shrank slightly as she looked at the three old men. Her face was icy as she emphasized every word with a pause.</p><p>&#x201C;Mulan. Three. Elders.&#x201D;</p>
