<p><strong><u>Chapter 609: Terrified</u></strong></p><p>The dark, cold killing intent that suddenly filled the sky also caused the expressions of quite a number of people to change. Although they were uncertain about what had exactly happened, it was clear by looking at Han Feng&#x2019;s appearance that he had truly formed the thought that Xiao Yan must be killed.</p><p>Su Qian waved his sleeves and forced back the Gold Silver Brothers who were pouncing over like vicious wolves. He tilted his head and watched the black-robed, young man in the air and a strange feeling flashed across his eyes. &#x201C;This feeling&#x2026;&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Xiao Yan, hold him off for a while. I will come and help you after finishing off these two old fellows.&#x201D; Su Qian&#x2019;s eyes gradually recovered after a flicker gradually flashed past it. His loud laughter resounded through the sky.</p><p>&#x201C;Ke ke, First Elder need only deal with them. Xiao Yan is not that weak.&#x201D; Xiao Yan cupped his hands toward Su Qian as he laughed out loud.</p><p>&#x201C;Hee hee, you got guts. Everyone has underestimated you, little fellow.&#x201D; Su Qian laughed in a manner that suggested the presence of a deeper meaning before Dou Qi erupted from Su Qian&#x2019;s body in all directions. He immediately watched the serious faces of the Gold Silver Brothers with an icy-cold expression. With a cold laugh, his body flashed and charged forward in a ghost-like manner. Seeing this sharp attack of his, the Gold Silver Brothers did not dare to underestimate it. They hurriedly joined hands to meet their opponent.</p><p>Xiao Yan withdrew his gaze from Su Qian&#x2019;s body. He let out a cold smile as he faced Han Feng on the opposite side who had killing intent on his face. With a flick of his finger, a wisp of green flame began to dance playfully in front of him, appearing like a spirit. He watched the flame and laughed softly, &#x201C;You want to kill me?&#x201D;</p><p>Han Feng&#x2019;s face twitched slightly. He forcefully halted his impulse to immediately charge over and cause Xiao Yan to disappear from this world. His voice was dry and ear-piercing, &#x201C;You&#x2026; where did you get this Qi Method from?&#x201D;</p><p>Xiao Yan smiled. He had yet to reply when a powerful spiritual strength suddenly entered his body. The instant that Spiritual Strength entered his body, Xiao Yan could clearly sense that the strength that he could control had once again soared greatly.</p><p>&#x201C;Teacher&#x2026; you?&#x201D; The sudden change also caused Xiao Yan to be startled. Would Han Feng on the opposite side not discover after Yao Lao poured all of his strength into Xiao Yan at this moment?</p><p>&#x201C;Ke ke, he will discover it sooner or later. Since that is the case, let&#x2019;s give him a &#x2018;surprise&#x2019;.&#x201D; Yao Lao&#x2019;s faint laughter sounded in Xiao Yan&#x2019;s heart. However, the last few words appeared somewhat ice-cold.</p><p>Xiao Yan hesitated slightly before nodding his head. The seal on his hand moved and completely undid the suppression of that enormous Spiritual Strength and allowed it to merge with his body.</p><p>With all of Yao Lao&#x2019;s Spiritual Strength being loaned to Xiao Yan, the turbulent green-colored flame on the latter&#x2019;s body also became increasingly energetic, repeatedly emitting a &#x2018;hu hu&#x2019; sound as it swiftly writhed.</p><p>The aura that suddenly soared over Xiao Yan caused Han Feng&#x2019;s expression to change slightly. His gaze stared intently at the former&#x2019;s body. A moment later, his body shrank abruptly. He seemed to be able to faintly sense a familiar strength as the green flame rose...</p><p>He searched his mind swiftly before finally focusing on an elderly human figure that was in the deep recesses of his mind.</p><p>An instant later, shock and panic immediately spread from deep within Han Feng&#x2019;s heart. The memory that came from long ago once again surfaced in his eyes, causing his entire body to tremble intensely.</p><p>His face that was filled with killing intent had been replaced by a strange paleness. Shock filled Han Feng&#x2019;s eyes as he watched Xiao Yan on the opposite side. A moment later, he appeared to have used all of his strength in order to emit an extremely shocked and panic-filled voice, &#x201C;You&#x2026; You didn&#x2019;t die! How is that possible?&#x201D;</p><p>Xiao Yan&#x2019;s gaze was indifferent as he stared at Han Feng whose face had suddenly become white. He responded, &#x201C;All thanks to you, I was given the chance to meet Teacher. Otherwise, this training journey of mine might have been much less interesting.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Teacher?&#x201D; Han Feng&#x2019;s eyes slightly narrowed. His gaze stared unblinkingly at Xiao Yan. The paleness that had just appeared on his face gradually reduced. Those eyes flickered and an even denser killing intent surfaced on his face. The news that Yao Lao did not die was like thunder to him. As Yao Lao&#x2019;s former disciple, he clearly knew just what kind of gathering ability that Yao Lao possessed on the continent back then. Even until now, those experts who were truly at the peak still had great memories of the &#x2018;Yao zun-ze&#x2019; who had shaken the continent back then. Han Feng did not doubt just how many strong people at the peak would come if news were to spread that Yao Lao was still alive.</p><p>Most importantly, Yao Lao had quite a good relationship with those experts at the peak. For example, the so called Feng zun-ze was in Yao Lao&#x2019;s debt for having been reborn. Hence, even after Yao Lao had disappeared for so many years, this person was still searching for traces of Yao Lao without stop. He had even investigated Han Feng a couple of times. Since he did not have the slightest evidence, he was unable to do anything to Han Feng. However, Yao Lao did not disappear with the wind like Han Feng had imagined. Instead, Yao Lao had survived. Han Feng did not dare to imagine just what kind of terrible state he would descend into if Yao Lao quietly spread the news of Han Feng murdering him back then!</p><p>At that time, it was likely that the so called Feng zun-ze would slice his skin open and pull out his ligaments. A legendary expert of the Dou Zun class was something that the current Han Feng did not dare provoke.</p><p>Han Feng&#x2019;s expression became volatile as this thought rolled in his heart. In the end, he finally decided on being savage, dark and cold. If he wanted to live, he must force Xiao Yan and Yao Lao to shut their mouths forever. Only a dead person could truly be trusted.</p><p>Killing intent surged on Han Feng&#x2019;s face. He was just like a poisonous snake hidden in a dark corner as he spoke with a hoarse voice, &#x201C;Old man who won&#x2019;t die, today, I will get both of you to to shut your mouths forever regardless of whether you are dead or alive.&#x201D;</p><p>Xiao Yan was expressionless. He flipped his hand and an even more ferocious green flame surged out from within his body. Finally, it lingered and whizzed like a tornado above his head.</p><p>&#x201C;I&#x2019;m afraid that you don&#x2019;t have the ability.&#x201D; Green flame danced on Xiao Yan&#x2019;s finger as his voice was like an old well without ripples, much like his current expression.</p><p>&#x201C;Hee hee, so the reason why you are this strong is because you have borrowed the Spiritual Strength of this old fellow who won&#x2019;t die. However, it is really unexpected that the &#x2018;Flame Mantra&#x2019; that he refused to pass to me despite having bitterly begged for it back then now actually belongs to a little brat like you. Does he think that you are better than me?&#x201D; Han Feng gave a dense smile. His voice faintly contained a jealously and hatred that was difficult to hide.</p><p>The corner of Xiao Yan&#x2019;s mouth was lifted into a faint cold smile. However, he did not say any other unnecessary words.</p><p>&#x201C;If he had passed the &#x2018;Flame Mantra&#x2019; to me back then, I would still treat him with respect. However&#x2026; who could blame the poor eyesight of that old man who won&#x2019;t die? Did he not understand my talent?&#x201D; Han Feng&#x2019;s face was somewhat flushed and he was a little agitated. He had always thought that if Yao Lao was willing to hand the &#x2018;Flame Mantra&#x2019; to him back then, the entire situation would be completely different.</p><p>Xiao Yan acted as though he did not hear anything when faced with Han Feng&#x2019;s hissing exhaustive roar. However, the flickering killing intent in those dark-black eyes grew increasingly dark and cold&#x2026; The green flame that was churning over his head suddenly surged down and agglomerated into a huge green-colored fireball on Xiao Yan&#x2019;s right hand. His left hand immediately began to spread slowly. Finally, he summoned a cluster of dense white flame under Han Feng&#x2019;s shocked gaze as the latter abruptly ceased speaking.</p><p>Han Feng&#x2019;s face completely solidified following the appearance of this dense white-colored flame. A moment later, both his eyes turned completely red as he hissed, &#x201C;&#x2018;Bone Chilling Flame&#x2019;... that old fellow who won&#x2019;t die even handed this to you? On what grounds?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;A bastard who devours his teacher actually has the qualification to say such things?&#x201D; Xiao Yan laughed softly and shook his head. The green and white flames on both his hands slowly approached. Finally, they began to make contact under Han Feng&#x2019;s stunned gaze.</p><p>The two colors intertwined and an unusual temperature immediately spread over the sky. Threads of flame-like lightning flickered at the point where the two clusters of &#x2018;Heavenly Flame&#x2019; made contact. The contact of these two &#x2018;Heavenly Flames&#x2019; caused space to shake at this very moment.</p><p>Han Feng temporarily withdrew the jealousy and fury within his heart as he watched Xiao Yan&#x2019;s actions. Even with Han Feng&#x2019;s experience, he also had difficulty understanding it. Did Xiao Yan not know the characteristics of &#x2018;Heavenly Flames&#x2019; not being able to merge? Although he was puzzled in his heart, Han Feng did not simply sit back and watch. He clenched his fist and the dark-blue flame swiftly agglomerated. Finally, it solidified into a substance-like dark-blue trident.</p><p>Han Feng held the fire trident that was over twenty feet in size. The confidence in his heart once again soared a little. His gaze was dark and cold as he glared at Xiao Yan who was doing his best to control the two kinds of &#x2018;Heavenly Flame&#x2019;. &#x201C;Old man who won&#x2019;t die. I know that you are in his body. However, today, I will no longer give you any chance to escape alive!&#x201D;</p><p>An extremely majestic blue-colored flame suddenly surged out from Han Feng&#x2019;s body in all directions as the voice sounded. The flame churned immediately, and it smashed down with a bang, like an enormous wave. Finally, it completely poured into the fire trident.</p><p>With the pouring in of such majestic flame, the fire trident instantly soared by dozens of feet. The hot dark-blue flame writhed unceasingly over it and the repeated bang of the waves rang beside one&#x2019;s ears.</p><p>&#x201C;Junior, this Senior will allow you and teacher to be buried here forever!&#x201D; The enormous fire trident surfaced on Han Feng&#x2019;s hand. He involuntarily moved his mouth as he sensed the majestic strength contained within it. A slight voice that carried a dark coldness was transmitted into Xiao Yan&#x2019;s ear,</p><p>Xiao Yan lifted his brows slightly. His eyes still paused on the intertwining &#x2018;Heavenly Flames&#x2019; on his hand. An instant later, his eyes suddenly became stern as his palms slammed together violently. These two kinds of &#x2018;Heavenly Flame&#x2019; that refused to merge even after a long while finally maintained an equilibrium. A bright intense light was immediately emitted from it, appearing much like a sun as it attracted the attention of many.</p><p>The intense light that suddenly appeared caused quite a number of gazes to be thrown over. A moment later, the intense light was weakened and the scene was finally clearly viewed by one&#x2019;s eyes.</p><p>A black-robed, young man was suspended in mid-air with a two foot wide green-white lotus slowly suspended above his palm. This green-white lotus was not very conspicuous. Compared to the green-purple flame that Xiao Yan had used, this flame appeared to be much more reserved. There was basically no energy that seeped out from it. However, as long as one had sharp eyes, one would discover that as the green-white lotus slowly rotated, the surrounding space would become strangely distorted.</p><p>Moreover, an ordinary person may not be able to sense how terrifying the fire lotus was but Su Qian and the Gold Silver Brothers who were engaged in the full swing of battle at a certain spot in the sky, suddenly halted their fight without any prior agreement. They suddenly turned their heads and immediately threw their eyes toward the green-white lotus in Xiao Yan&#x2019;s hand. Their eyes were filled with a terror that was difficult to hide.</p><p>This strength was something that caused even them to feel a kind of&#x2026; terror!</p>
