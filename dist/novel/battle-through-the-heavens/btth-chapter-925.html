<p><strong><u>Chapter 925: The Woeful Poison Body Erupting Ahead of Time</u></strong></p><p>By the time Xiao Yan rushed to the Little Fairy Doctor&#x2019;s residence, he had discovered that the place had already been completely sealed by an energy light barrier that originated from the top down. Some of the Inner Academy Elders had stopped at this place with solemn faces, and chased away some curious students who had arrived.</p><p>A black figure approached from the distant and appeared outside of the light curtain an instant later. The few Inner Academy Elders were about to stop him when they saw this person&#x2019;s face. Only then did they sigh in relief. They cupped their hands to Xiao Yan and moved their bodies aside. &#x201C;First Elder is inside. You should quickly go in. Be careful of the poison gas.&#x201D; An Elder swiftly said after seeing Xiao Yan.</p><p>The anxiety within Xiao Yan&#x2019;s eyes became even denser when he heard this. He nodded and a jade-green flame surged from his body. He immediately entered the light barrier.</p><p>A grayish air that carried some stench pounced toward him after he entered the light barrier. However, when it reached the jade-green flame, it was grilled by the high temperature into nothingness, emitting waves of chi chi sound.</p><p>Xiao Yan ignored the grayish air that lingered around him and swiftly passed through the courtyard. His footsteps paused when he saw First Elder Su Qian pacing back and forth at the entrance. He hurriedly asked, &#x201C;First Elder, what has happened?&#x201D;</p><p>Su Qian hurriedly turned around when he heard Xiao Yan&#x2019;s voice. He immediately sighed in relief. Pointing to the interior of the house, he spoke with a bitter smile, &#x201C;I am also unaware of what has happened. Today, an Elder suddenly came and report that this place was emitting a poison gas. Quite a few students have accidentally become unconsciousness from the poison. I can only seal this place. Originally, I wanted to head in and investigate, but the poison gas inside is too dense. Its corrosive strength is extremely great. If I were to forcefully enter, I&#x2019;m afraid&#x2026;&#x201D;</p><p>Xiao Yan&#x2019;s heart tightened. An uneasiness surged forth. He inhaled a deep breath and swiftly walked forward. When he was about to push open the door, Su Qian by the side hesitated a little and held back his hand that was about to halt Xiao Yan. He sighed, &#x201C;Be careful.&#x201D;</p><p>With a nod, Xiao Yan pushed open the door. The jade-green flame curled and rose, wrapping all around his body without letting even a little air pass through. After which, he slowly walked into the room saturated by the grayish-purple poison.</p><p>A thread of grayish-purple poison fog scattered out when the door was opened. Su Qian hurriedly used his Dou Qi to wrap it up. After which, he carefully refined it. With a wave of his sleeve, the opened door was once again tightly shut. He cried out loud, &#x201C;Xiao Yan, shout out loud if any situation occurs!&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;First Elder, relax. It is fine if you seal this place. Do not allow anyone else to enter.&#x201D; Xiao Yan&#x2019;s solemn voice was transmitted from the room.</p><p>Su Qian nodded. He slowly stepped back and looked at the house. After a brief hesitation, the seal on his hand suddenly moved and a Dou Qi pillar shot out. Immediately, it scattered down from the sky and wrapped the house within it. After doing all this, he still appeared to feel somewhat uneasy. He used his spatial strength to add another layer of defense outside of the Dou Qi barrier.</p><p>One could not blame Su Qian for being this careful. Even he was extremely afraid of the poison gas within the Little Fairy Doctor&#x2019;s body. If this poison gas was allowed to spread, it was likely that not a corpse would be left with the entire Inner Academy.</p><p>&#x201C;Ugh, hopefully, Xiao Yan is able to resolve this matter.&#x201D; Su Qian only sighed in relief after doing all this. He looked at the tightly shut room and muttered with a bitter smile.</p><p>One&#x2019;s sight was greatly hindered within the room where the poison gas originated. However, by borrowing the slight breathing sound that was transmitted over, Xiao Yan was able to vaguely locate the Little Fairy Doctor.</p><p>Layers upon layers of grayish-purple poison fog lingered within the room. Following each approaching step, the surrounding poison fog was filled with waves of ripples. However, it was fortunate that he had the Glazed Lotus Core Flame protecting his body. With the help of the high temperature isolation, the poison gas was unable to cause him much harm.</p><p>Xiao Yan took around a dozen steps before a pink bed appeared in front of his eyes. A lovely figure was gently curled up on the bed. A tightly wrapped thin quilt faintly outlined the graceful figure under it. The dense poison fog that permeated the room poured unceasingly from her body&#x2026;</p><p>The figure within the quilt trembled slightly appearing to have sensed the sound of footsteps. Immediately, a pair of grayish-purple eyes that appeared to be suffering shot out from within. The eyes looked at the black-robed, young man who had walked to the side of her bed. Her soft voice contained a suffering that was difficult to hide, &#x201C;The &#x2018;Woeful Poison Body&#x2019; appears to be about to erupt ahead of time.&#x201D;</p><p>Although Xiao Yan had long anticipated this, his face still involuntarily changed when he heard these words. He looked at the pain and paleness on her moving face and hurriedly sat down beside her bed. He softly comforted her, &#x201C;Relax, everything will be fine. There&#x2019;s still me around.&#x201D;</p><p>Xiao Yan&#x2019;s heart clearly understood that with the Little Fairy Doctor&#x2019;s strength, she would at the very least be able to suppress the &#x2018;Woeful Poison Body&#x2019; for a year. However, during this period of time, she had undone the seal of the &#x2018;Woeful Poison Body&#x2019; a couple of times. This had significantly brought forward the time of the eruption&#x2026;</p><p>&#x201C;Give your hand to me.&#x201D; Xiao Yan said. He might be beating himself in his heart, but he did not dare delay things any longer.</p><p>The Little Fairy Doctor hesitated a little when she heard him, but she extended her long delicate arm from the under quilt. At this moment, her hand was faintly emitting a strange purple color, causing the solemness in Xiao Yan&#x2019;s eyes to become denser.</p><p>Xiao Yan&#x2019;s hand was placed on Little Fairy Doctor wrist. A slight wisp of flame followed the point of contact and seeped in. After which, it swiftly entered the Little Fairy Doctor&#x2019;s body.</p><p>Xiao Yan&#x2019;s expression gradually become much uglier after the flame seeped in. At this moment, the Little Fairy Doctor&#x2019;s body seemed to have completely infused with the poison gas. Moreover, this poison gas appeared to be rising and entering her head. Xiao Yan knew that if this poison gas were to enter her brain, the Little Fairy Doctor&#x2019;s consciousness would gradually blur. At that time, it was likely that she would become like the past owners of the &#x2018;Woeful Poison Body,&#x2019; waiting for the miserable final step. Born from woe, and dying in woe!</p><p>The Little Fairy Doctor&#x2019;s intelligent eyes slowly became much dimmer as she looked at Xiao Yan&#x2019;s gradually uglier expression. The back of her teeth bit her lower lip as she softly said, &#x201C;Xiao Yan, I have been very happy following you during this period of time. You are my first friend and might also be my last. If I really reach that step, I hope that you will not hold back. I love the academy in this place very much. After I lose consciousness, I don&#x2019;t wish to&#x2026;&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Shut up! What nonsense are you spouting?&#x201D; Hearing the Little Fairy Doctor&#x2019;s saying her last words, Xiao Yan immediately frowned and reprimanded her.</p><p>Despite being reprimanded, the Little Fairy Doctor was not angry. She instead revealed a faint moving smile on her face. Her head was tilted slightly as she leaned against the pillow on her back. A pair of bewitching grayish-purple eyes gently stared at Xiao Yan&#x2019;s repeatedly changing face. This feeling of someone being concerned and anxious about her was something that she had not enjoyed much of. It seemed that this feeling was very nice&#x2026;</p><p>Xiao Yan did not have the time to bother about the Little Fairy Doctor&#x2019;s gaze at this moment. He tightly knit his brows and descended deep into thought. The so-called Poison Pill method to completely control the &#x2018;Woeful Poison Body&#x2019; still lacked the &#x2018;Sky Poison Dragon Scorpion Beast&#x2019; Monster Core. It was one of the key ingredients of the Poison Pill and could not be left out. Otherwise, if one were to attempt to forcefully make it, it would only end up wasting the Bodhisattva Body Transformation Saliva that he had obtained after much effort.</p><p>Xiao Yan&#x2019;s mind churned with all its might, attempting to find a kind of method to temporarily suppress the &#x2018;Woeful Poison Body&#x2019; from the medicinal formulas that Yao Lao had left behind. However, the result left him disappointed. The &#x2018;Woeful Poison Body&#x2019; was extremely rare. It was impossible for Yao Lao to purposefully find some method to deal with this kind of thing. Hence, Xiao Yan&#x2019;s search was futile.</p><p>Just when Xiao Yan was anxious and helpless that his face was covered with perspiration, an old voice suddenly carried a little surprise as it sounded from within his heart, &#x201C;&#x2018;Woeful Poison Constitution?&#x2019; Hei, it is unexpected that the old me is able to see this thing twice in my lifetime. I am really lucky.&#x201D;</p><p>A wild joy immediately surged into Xiao Yan&#x2019;s heart when he heard this voice. He appeared to be grabbing onto his last straw as he hurriedly inquired, &#x201C;Old mister Yao, do you also know about the &#x2018;Woeful Poison Body?&#x2019; Do you have a method to temporarily suppress it?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Haha, the &#x2018;Woeful Poison Body.&#x2019; Who among the older generation does not know of such a name?&#x201D; Tian Huo zun-zhe laughed faintly, &#x201C;However, this friend of yours seems to be in the last stages of the &#x2018;Woeful Poison Body&#x2019; eruption. If it is not sealed and the poison gas enters her brain, the result&#x2026;&#x201D;</p><p>Xiao Yan was startled when he heard this. He inhaled a deep breath of air and asked, &#x201C;Does old mister Yao know a method to suppress this &#x2018;Woeful Poison Body&#x2019;?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Consider yourself lucky that you have met the old me at this time. It is likely that there are extremely few people who know about this sealing method in this continent. Back then, I also possessed a friend with the &#x2018;Woeful Poison Body.&#x2019; This sealing method was created for him. Unfortunately, this seal can only be used once and, at the very most, only last three years. Three years later, I still failed to find a method to overcome the &#x2018;Woeful Poison Body,&#x2019; hence&#x2026;&#x201D; Tian Huo zun-zhe softly sighed.</p><p>Xiao Yan was also startled when he heard his words. This world was indeed full of strange coincidences. After sighing emotionally, he also exhaled in relief, feeling as though he had removed a heavy burden. A three year seal was already sufficient. He did not believe that he would not be able to obtain the so-called Sky Poison Dragon Scorpion Beast Monster Core within three years.</p><p>&#x201C;This seal is called the &#x2018;All Day Fire Seal.&#x2019; It borrows the positive violence in a fire affinity Qi Method to suppress the poison gas. Currently, the &#x2018;Heavenly Flame&#x2019; you possess within your body is able to optimize the effects of the seal. Below is the sealing method.&#x201D; Tian Huo zun-zhe&#x2019;s voice had just sounded when a message surged into Xiao Yan&#x2019;s mind. He swiftly received it.</p><p>Xiao Yan shut his eyes tightly. A moment later, he finally began to slowly open them. His expression gradually recovered its normal appearance. He lifted his eyes, glanced at the Little Fairy Doctor on the bed, and laughed softly, &#x201C;There is a method to suppress it.&#x201D; The Little Fairy Doctor was startled when she heard this. Joy flowed from her face.</p><p>Xiao Yan also smiled when he saw her reaction. After which, he appeared to have recalled something and involuntarily and dryly coughed. He haltingly said, &#x201C;In order to use this seal, you will need to remove your clothes.&#x201D; Xiao Yan&#x2019;s words had just sounded when the pretty face of the Little Fairy Doctor abruptly turned into a burning hot one. She turned her head to one side and did not dare look at Xiao Yan.</p>
