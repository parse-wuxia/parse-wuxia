<p><strong><u>Chapter 218: Reining In The Green Lotus Core Flame</u></strong></p><p>Seeing the seven-colored small snake&#x2019;s action, Xiao Yan&#x2019;s mouth opened and smiled bitterly in his heart. &#x201C;I bet that this snake is definitely not Queen Medusa, With her haughty character, she would not be like this&#x2026; The current her, seems to be no different than a small snake that has just been born. The only difference is that its intelligence is much higher.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Don&#x2019;t tell me that the evolution destroyed its old memories?&#x201D; Yao Lao was also very confused with regards to this.</p><p>&#x201C;Huh&#x2026;&#x201D; Xiao Yan stilled for a moment and narrowed his eyes. An unknown meaning flashed from within them as he smiled and said, &#x201C;She seems to be interested with something in my ring.&#x201D;</p><p>As he spoke, Xiao Yan&#x2019;s finger gently tapped on his storage ring. A couple of things appeared on his palm. The small seven-colored snake moved closer. It swept its gaze across and swayed its snake tail while repeatedly shaking its head. Clearly, the thing it wanted was not among these items.</p><p>Xiao Yan stored the things back into the storage ring. He was not frustrated as he patiently took out more things, one by one, out of the storage ring. A moment later, when he once again took out a small jade bottle that was filled with a purple-colored liquid, the small snake which had curled up in midair immediately appeared at where his palm was as though it had teleported. It extended its small snake tongue into the jade bottle and used took a few ferocious licks.</p><p>&#x201C;This is&#x2026; Amethyst Lion Birth Essence. I did not expect that what it wanted is this thing.&#x201D; Eyeing the Amethyst Lion Birth Essence which had swiftly been reduced by nearly a tenth, a painful feeling surfaced on Xiao Yan&#x2019;s face. However, it appeared that this little creature knew about the power of the Amethyst Essence. It did not greedily absorb any more. After taking a few licks, it pulled its head out. Its crystal clear snake pupils danced with excitement and satisfaction.</p><p>&#x201C;The Seven-Colored Heaven Swallowing Python&#x2019; is also an exotic beast which is of the fire affinity. Naturally, it has a great liking for the Amethyst Essence which is filled with pure fire type energy.&#x201D; Yao Lao said with a smile as he watched the small seven-colored snake&#x2019;s excitement.</p><p>Xiao Yan nodded his head and painfully returned the somewhat diminished Amethyst Essence to his storage ring.</p><p>It seemed that since the snake had absorbed the Amethyst Lion Birth Essence, there was less caution within the eyes of the small seven-colored snake as they looked at Xiao Yan.</p><p>Clearly sensing the change in the small snake&#x2019;s gaze, Xiao Yan&#x2019;s heart moved slightly. He carefully extended his hand and gently caressed its small body.</p><p>Seeing Xiao Yan&#x2019;s action, the small seven-colored snake twisted its body. It then gave up avoiding Xiao Yan&#x2019;s hand, twisted its small head and lazily rubbed itself on Xiao Yan&#x2019;s hand.</p><p>Eyeing the action of the small snake that did not have the slightest enmity, an unusual glint in his eyes suddenly grew.</p><p>&#x201C;Hehe, boy, are you planning to keep this thing by your side?&#x201D; Seemingly clearly understanding Xiao Yan&#x2019;s thoughts, Yao Lao&#x2019;s voice immediately sounded in his heart.</p><p>&#x201C;Hehe.&#x201D; Xiao Yan let out two dry chuckles. He licked his lips and said with an excited voice in his heart, &#x201C;This is an ancient exotic beast with limitless potential. If I keep it for myself, it won&#x2019;t lose to me controlling a &#x2018;Heavenly Flame&#x2019; in value.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;The &#x2018;Seven-Colored Heaven Swallowing Python&#x2019; is indeed very strong, but the current her is clearly only at a baby stage. Her body does indeed contain an extremely enormous energy, but she must undergo honing for an unknown amount of time before it can completely master it.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Moreover, you should know that regardless of how docile the &#x2018;Seven-Colored Heaven Swallowing Python&#x2019; is now, I dare to bet that her original body is definitely that of Queen Medusa. Perhaps, she has now become like this because of some unknown reason but no one can say for certain that she will not suddenly recover her memories in the future. When that time comes&#x2026;&#x201D; Yao Lao said gravely, &#x201C;You should know very well the arrogance and viciousness of Queen Medusa. For you who dares to take the opportunity of becoming her owner, she might as well butcher you on the spot with her character.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Uh&#x2026;&#x201D; The palm which was rubbing the small seven-colored snake stiffened. Xiao Yan frowned and mused for a long while. Finally, he sighed gently and whispered, &#x201C;But what if she doesn&#x2019;t regain her memories? The current her is just like a small beast which has just been born. I am also the first person she saw. Regardless of what happens, I think that she should not have too much enmity toward me. Otherwise, she wouldn&#x2019;t stay by my side looking for food the moment she appeared&#x2026; This is an extremely good opportunity&#x2026; An ancient exotic beast that may be able to contend with the legendary Dou Sheng in the future. That is a fatal attraction.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;You are gambling&#x2026;&#x201D; Yao Lao helplessly sighed.</p><p>&#x201C;Haha, what&#x2019;s wrong with gambling once in a while for an extremely strong bodyguard in the future. If that kind of situation were to occur in the future, isn&#x2019;t there still Teacher? When that time comes, if we can&#x2019;t beat her&#x2026; then we will flee.&#x201D; Xiao Yan laughed.</p><p>&#x201C;Ugh, I hope you will not burn yourself by playing with fire.&#x201D; Yao Lao said with a bitter smile.</p><p>Xiao Yan smiled gently and carefully carried the small seven-colored snake with both hands. The small seven-colored snake did not resist his gentle action. It swung its tail and curled around Xiao Yan&#x2019;s wrist. After which, it swung its body, much like playing on a swing.</p><p>&#x201C;Little thing, do you want to leave with me?&#x201D; Putting the small snake in front of him, Xiao Yan said softly as he smiled. That expression was the same expression that many would use for trying to dupe a little girl who was lost by the roadside.</p><p>Opening its purple-colored snake eyes, the small seven-colored snake stared at the young man&#x2019;s face. An extremely human like feeling of being at a loss flashed across its pupils. It straightened its body and blankly stared at Xiao Yan in this manner.</p><p>Seeing the strange action of the small seven-colored snake, Xiao Yan&#x2019;s heart pounded. The smile on his face was somewhat embarrassing. He seemed to faintly sense that a matured and haughty spirit within the small seven-colored snake&#x2019;s body was coldly glaring at his inferior performance.</p><p>Xiao Yan coughed lightly, rotated his eyes and tapped his finger on the storage ring. A bottle of Amethyst Lion Birth Essence appeared in his palm. After taking out a small white jade stick, he placed a few drops of Amethyst Essence on it and waved it gently in front of the small seven-colored snake.</p><p>When the Amethyst Essence appeared, the snake eyes of the small seven-colored snake glowed brightly. That human like feeling of loss swiftly disappeared. Opening its mouth, it extended its snake&#x2019;s tongue toward Xiao Yan much like it was begging for it.</p><p>&#x201C;Hee hee&#x2026;&#x201D; Following the small seven-colored snake&#x2019;s action, the matured and haughty spirit in its body seemed to once again become quiet. Immediately, a smile was lifted from the corner of Xiao yan&#x2019;s mouth. Regardless of whether Queen Medusa spirit was present or not, the current &#x2018;Seven-Colored Heaven Swallowing Python&#x2019; at the very least, did not possess the ability to resist the attraction brought about by the Amethyst Essence.</p><p>After Xiao Yan dropped the Amethyst Essence into the small snake&#x2019;s mouth, the latter smacked its lips with satisfaction. A moment later, the snake&#x2019;s tail coiled around Xiao Yan&#x2019;s wrist and then it entered into his sleeves before gradually entering into a deep sleep.</p><p>&#x201C;Ha ha!&#x201D; Eyeing the &#x2018;Seven-Colored Heaven Swallowing Python&#x2019;, Xiao Yan opened his mouth and instantly let out a loud laugh. With the help from the Amethyst Essence, he and the snake had swiftly became close. If this kind of situation continued, Xiao Yan believed that he could turn their relationship into an extremely firm one before she became mature and started possessing a human-like intellect.</p><p>Xiao Yan gently patted his sleeve with his palm. The joy on his face was difficult to conceal. Licking up the little bit of Amethyst Essence on the white jade stick, Xiao Yan allowed the hot energy to surge in his body as he opened his mouth and laughed. Xiao Yan took a few steps forward as he lifted his head to eye the cluster of green-colored flame in midair and smiled. After a few twists and turns, this &#x2018;Green Lotus Core Flame&#x2019; had finally appeared in front of him.</p><p>Although he was extremely anxious in his heart, Xiao Yan did not make any reckless moves. This thing known as a &#x2018;Heavenly Flame&#x2019; was like a bomb. If one were not careful, a destructive force would suddenly erupt from it, just like what happened a moment ago. He was not Queen Medusa who may have been able to withstand the force of the flame by a little but if it were him instead, he would be completely turned into nothingness in less than ten seconds.</p><p>&#x201C;Teacher&#x2026; now, how do we rein it in?&#x201D; Eyeing the &#x2018;Heavenly Flame&#x2019; in midair with a yearning clearly evident on his face, Xiao Yan hurriedly inquired.</p><p>&#x201C;Reining in the &#x2018;Heavenly Flame&#x2019; is not very easy. It will incinerate anything that comes close to it into nothingness. This includes energy. Other than some special objects, you can only use a never ending supply of energy to forcefully wrap around it and take it away. I think, Queen Medusa used this method back then.&#x201D; Yao Lao voiced his thoughts, &#x201C;But that method exhausts an extremely large amount of energy. With your current self, you would not be able to move this flame off of this small island even if you let out all the Dou Qi within the vortex.</p><p>&#x201C;Uh&#x2026; then what do we do?&#x201D; Hearing this, Xiao Yan&#x2019;s expression immediately collapsed as he inquired in a devastated manner.</p><p>&#x201C;Ke ke, naturally we cannot adopt Queen Medusa&#x2019;s method. Neither one of us can afford it.&#x201D; Yao Lao grinned and said, &#x201C;What I have said before applies to others. But you are different, you have a tool that can easily bring the &#x2018;Green Lotus Core Flame&#x2019; away.&#x201D;</p><p>Xiao Yan was at a loss momentarily. He blinked his eyes and a moment later, he suddenly said, &#x201C;You are referring to the Green Lotus Lotus&#x2019;s Seat?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Haha, precisely. The Green Lotus Seat and the &#x2018;Green Lotus Core Flame&#x2019; originate from the same source. If you use the seat to carry the flame, not only will it suppress the &#x2018;Heavenly Flame&#x2019; to the lowest temperature such that it will not spill out but it will also be much safer in comparison to using energy to wrap around it.&#x201D; Yao Lao said with yet another smile.</p><p>Xiao Yan nodded his head and quickly tapped on the storage ring with his finger. Instantly, a green-colored glow slowly rose from the storage ring and was suspended in front of Xiao Yan. Within the green-colored glow, there was a Green Lotus Seat that was as perfect as a piece of art. It rotated slightly and released a faint energy.</p><p>Pulling the Green Lotus Seat with his hand, Xiao Yan threw it gently over the &#x2018;Heavenly Flame&#x2019; in midair. A faint green-colored glow was emitted from the Green Lotus Seat when it reached the bottom of the flame. Finally, it quietly wrapped around the &#x2018;Green Lotus Core Flame.&#x201D;</p><p>As the green-colored glow diminished in size, the &#x2018;Heavenly Flame&#x2019; gradually fell into the core of the lotus without any resistance. A strange green-colored flame immediately rose within the empty core of the Lotus.</p><p>&#x201C;Success&#x2026;&#x201D; The process of obtaining the Heavenly Flame was so smooth that Xiao Yan was surprised. He eyed the &#x2018;Green Lotus Core Flame&#x2019; that had been stored into the Green Lotu Seat with a face that was filled with joy. Xiao Yan carefully held the bottom of the Green Lotus Seat as he stared intently at the cluster of green-colored flame in the middle. An excitement flashed involuntarily in his dark black eyes.</p><p>&#x201C;Next, hurry and leave this city. Find a quiet place and swallow the &#x2018;Heavenly Flame&#x2019;! Remember, do not store the &#x2018;Heavenly Flame&#x2019; in the storage ring during this period of time. Otherwise, the things inside will be incinerated into nothingness.&#x201D; Yao Lao warned with a grave voice.</p><p>&#x201C;Yes!&#x201D; Xiao Yan&#x2019;s body trembled as he nodded his head seriously. The Purple Cloud Wings extended from his back while his hand grabbed an &#x2018;Energy Recovery Pill&#x2019; and stuffed it into his mouth. After which, he gravely raised his head and watched the purple light curtain that was imminently disappearing.</p><p>The purple-colored light curtain flickered and at some point in time, it finally turned into tiny lights that filled the sky after a &#x2018;bang&#x2019;.</p><p>When the purple-colored light curtain exploded, Xiao Yan&#x2019;s feet suddenly and violently pushed off the ground. His body shot to the sky as he carried the Green Lotus Seat, rushing with all his might to get out of the city.</p>
