<p><strong><u>Chapter 1229: Falling Star Pavilion</u></strong></p><p>The Falling Star Pavilion was situated at the southern region of the Central Plains. Amongst the so called four pavilions, the Falling Star Pavilion had the least number of disciples. Of course, their numbers might not make it but it was fortunate that the Falling Star Pavilion could pass in terms of quality. One must not underestimate a disciple from the Falling Star Pavilion due to the latter&#x2019;s young age should one end up meeting him. This was because the Falling Star Pavilion never recruit mediocre people&#x2026;</p><p>The Falling Star Pavilion did not only possess the least number of disciples amongst the four Pavilions but it was also the most mysterious one. The other three pavilions built their headquarters in an extremely grand manner, causing one to be able to sense the great strength of this sect from a glance. However, the Falling Star Pavilion was different. Unless it was someone who had a great understanding of the Falling Star Pavilion, otherwise, it was likely that one would have difficulty even finding the location of the sect. This caused the Falling Star Pavilion to possess an additional mysterious feel to it from other people&#x2019;s perspective.</p><p>The Pill Region was at a greatest distance from the southern region. Even with the speed of Yao Lao&#x2019;s group, they had spent nearly half a month before truly entering the boundary of the southern region. After which, they spent another seven to eight days before coming to a stop after reaching the exterior area of the Sky Star Mountain Range in the southern region.</p><p>&#x201C;The Falling Star Pavilion is located within the Sky Star Mountain Range. Ha ha, the place is a little unique. If one did not possess a special entry method, even an elite Dou Zun would not be able to enter it.&#x201D; Feng zun-zhe also sighed in relief as he watched the familiar lush green mountain range. He turned his head and smilingly spoke to the weary Little Fairy Doctor&#x2019;s group.</p><p>&#x201C;Sky Star Mountain Range&#x2026; it is been many years that I haven&#x2019;t visited this place.&#x201D; Yao Lao looked at the continuous mountain range and sighed.</p><p>&#x201C;The Falling Star Pavilion was established by the two of us back then. However, you end up being an absent leader. Everything was done by me. It had caused me to end in a terrible state back then.&#x201D; Feng zun-zhe shook his head and said.</p><p>&#x201C;Ha ha.&#x201D; Yao Lao laughed. &#x201C;I do not like these things. Back then, I have established this Falling Star Pavilion because I was a little interested&#x2026;&#x201D;</p><p>Feng zun-zhe could only shake his head helplessly when he heard this. After which, he turned around and waved towards everyone. Next, he rushed hurriedly towards the mountain range. Little Fairy Doctor and the rest followed closely behind.</p><p>The group flew for over ten minutes within this vast mountain range before Feng zun-zhe at the front finally came to a slow halt. Little Fairy Doctor and the others behind were startled. Their eyes swept in all directions but they only end up discovering that this place was still a lush green forest. Their surroundings did not possess any buildings nor was there any mountains. It was completely just an ordinary sea of trees.</p><p>&#x201C;Ke ke, this is the Great Falling Star Formation of the Falling Star Pavilion. This great formation is not man made. Instead, it is naturally formed&#x2026;&#x201D; Feng zun-zhe smiled slightly. An old jade appeared in his hand. After which, he flew out and a tread of strange star light spread out from within it. Light spread and the space in front actually became gradually distorted. Finally, it formed a large spatial door in front of the stunned gazes of Little Fairy Doctor&#x2019;s group.</p><p>&#x201C;Let&#x2019;s go. Inside this place is the true headquarters of the Falling Star Pavilion&#x2026;&#x201D; Feng zun-zhe smiled and took the lead to step into that large spatial door. Little Fairy Doctor and the rest behind hesitated for a moment before following him. After everyone entered, that large spatial door was finally turned invisible again&#x2026;</p><p>...</p><p>Little Fairy Doctor and the others sensed that the area in front of them became blurry for a moment after entering the large spatial door. The world in front of them appeared to have travelled through time as it suddenly changed. The originally endless sea of trees currently had a tall mountain appearing. There were some buildings that could be seen on the top of the mountain. One could even vaguely hear the cries from sparing.</p><p>&#x201C;This is strictly speaking a realm that is created from the star strength of the meteorite. Ke ke, of course, it cannot be compared with those large realms created by those elite Dou Shengs. The size of this place is merely similar to that of a city&#x2026;&#x201D; Feng zun-zhe laughed. &#x201C;However, due to this place being naturally formed, its ability to hide is extremely great. Even an elite Dou Zun would have difficulty sensing the profoundness of this place should they fly pass it.&#x201D;</p><p>Little Fairy Doctor and the rest were also amazed when they heard this. Only Zi Yan curled her little lips. She already knew that this place had some mysteriousness to it when she looked over from outside earlier. Of course, she was the only one in this group who possessed such an ability.</p><p>&#x201C;Sceech!&#x201D;</p><p>Soon after everyone had appeared in this realm, over a dozen large white cranes suddenly flew over from the distant mountain top. There were some human figures standing on those cranes. A green figure, who led them, rushed over. After which, the figure appeared in front of everyone. It was surprisingly Mu Qing Luan, whom Xiao Yan had met once.</p><p>&#x201C;Teacher&#x2026;&#x201D;</p><p>Mu Qing Luan sighed in relief when she saw that the person who had come was Feng zun-zhe. She waved her hand and asked those white crane lingering in the midair to withdraw.</p><p>&#x201C;Yes.&#x201D; Feng zun-zhe smilingly nodded. After which, he pointed towards Yao Lao beside him and said, &#x201C;Quick, come and greet the pavilion chief of our Falling Star Pavilion.&#x201D;</p><p>Mu Qing Luan was startled when she heard this. She glanced at Yao Lao and suddenly discovered that the latter looked exactly the same as the drawing of the founder within the sect. Immediately, she understood that Feng zun-zhe was not joking and hurriedly spoke in a respectful manner, &#x201C;Qing Luan greets&#x2026; hall chief.&#x201D;</p><p>Yao Lao helplessly shook his head and spoke in fashion where he could neither laugh nor cry, &#x201C;You old fellow, you are purposefully trying to embarrass me&#x2026;&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;You are originally the hall chief of the Falling Star Pavilion, how could it embarrass you&#x2026;&#x201D; Feng zun-zhe smiled. He turned his head towards Mu Qing Luan and said, &#x201C;With Yao zun-zhe here in the future, all of you people are going to be blessed.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Yao zun-zhe?&#x201D;</p><p>Mu Qing Luan&#x2019;s heart was quite shaken when she heard these words. Yao Lao&#x2019;s name back then was basically known by everyone within the Central Plains. She had occasionally heard Feng zun-zhe mention about him. However, she did not expect that she was actually able to meet him in person today.</p><p>&#x201C;Forget it, don&#x2019;t listen to this old fellow talk nonsense. Let&#x2019;s settle Xiao Yan down first&#x2026;&#x201D; Yao Lao waved his hand and said.</p><p>Mu Qing Luan&#x2019;s eyes moved when she heard this and saw Xiao Yan on the back of Xiong Zhan. She was involuntarily shocked when she saw the latter covered in fresh blood with only a breath left. Although she could not be said to have an extremely good understanding of Xiao Yan, she also understood that this fellow was not an ordinary person. Who could turn such a shrewd fellow into this manner.</p><p>&#x201C;Let&#x2019;s go. This little fellow engaged in a head on clash with a five star Dou Zun. Although he broke one of the other party&#x2019;s arm, he had also been beaten until he is seriously injured.&#x201D; Feng zun-zhe sighed and explained.</p><p>&#x201C;Buzz!&#x201D;</p><p>The head of Mu Qing Luan by the side began to buzz when Feng zun-zhe&#x2019;s sigh fell. She stared at Xiao Yan in a stunned manner. This fellow actually dared to exchange blow with an elite Dou Zun. Moreover, it was someone who had reached the level of a five star Dou Zun? This strength was something that even her teacher, Feng zun-zhe had never reached&#x2026; moreover, the thing that really caused the corner of her mouth to twitch was that this fellow had actually even broken one of the other party&#x2019;s arm?</p><p>Mu Qing Luan wiped off some cold sweat. A moment later, she finally recovered gradually. A bitter laughter appeared in his heart. Just what did this fellow do during this one year? Back then, just a northern pavilion chief of the Wind Lightning Pavilion had already managed to chase after him until he fled in all directions like a dog which had lost its home. Yet, within this short one year, his opponent had already directly leaped from the Dou Zong class to the Dou Zun class.</p><p>Mu Qing Luan turned her body around while her head was still a little dazzled. She led the group to head up to the mountain top. After which, she obeyed Feng zun-zhe&#x2019;s instruction and arrange for Little Fairy Doctor and the others to settle down. After doing all these, she finally recovered from the shock that Feng zun-zhe&#x2019;s words brought. A strange thought suddenly rose within her heart.</p><p>&#x201C;If that Feng Qing Er was to meet Xiao Yan now, I wonder just what kind of interesting expression she will have.&#x201D;</p><p>After settling the weary Little Fairy Doctor&#x2019;s group down, Yao Lao and Feng zun-zhe carried Xiao Yan and directly rushed to the back mountain. A moment later, a dark black stone tower appeared in their sight.</p><p>This stone tower was built in an extremely crude manner. It was described as a stone tower but it looked more like an ugly black stone pillar. Although its exterior appearance was ugly, this rock pillar was the place with the strongest star strength within this area. This was because this was coincidentally the point where that meteorite from space gathered the star strength.</p><p>Feng zun-zhe carried Xiao Yan and leaped onto the top of the stone tower. This top level was around thirty to forty feet wide. There was a black stone stage within it. The top of the stone stage was only five feet wide. If one looked through the space, one would coincidentally be able to see that clear sky. This meteorite not only gathered star strength but it was also able to absorb the star strength from space. This stone stage was the gathering spot for these two strength that were absorbed&#x2026;</p><p>Feng zun-zhe carefully placed Xiao Yan on the stone stage. At this moment, the latter had both of his eyes shut tightly. There was barely any breath left. Even the sound of his breathing was unusually weak. His entire person was no different from that of a dying person.</p><p>Xiao Yan&#x2019;s body had just lied on the stone stage when a wave of dense star strength permeated out from the stone platform. After which, it continued to gather into his body. Purple-brown flame curled and rose at this moment. It transformed into a circular fire barrier that covered the entire of Xiao Yan&#x2019;s body.</p><p>Feng zun-zhe and Yao Lao rejoiced instead of being shocked when they saw this scene. At this moment, the Three Thousand Burning Flame was increasing dense. Xiao Yan&#x2019;s injuries would thus recover increasingly quickly.</p><p>&#x201C;This Falling Star Stage is indeed not bad&#x2026;&#x201D; Yao Lao sighed in his heart and softly said.</p><p>&#x201C;Ke ke, there is no need to be worried. As long as there is sufficient star strength to support it, the Three Thousand Burning Flame will never be extinguished. Xiao Yan would also make a complete recovery from his injuries&#x2026;&#x201D; Feng zun-zhe laughed.</p><p>Yao Lao nodded gently.</p><p>&#x201C;Let&#x2019;s go. Allow him to stay here alone quietly and recuperate. This recuperation period will likely be long. We can only wait&#x2026;&#x201D;</p><p>Yao Lao smiled and nodded. It did not matter how long or short it would take. As long as Xiao Yan was able to recover the injuries within his body, the length of time needed did not matter&#x2026;</p><p>&#x201C;Little fellow, take care. Teacher is still waiting for you to help me refine a body&#x2026;&#x201D;</p><p>Yao Lao smiled slightly as he watched the pain on Xiao Yan&#x2019;s face reduce a little when the flame rose. Only then did he wore a tired expression between his brows and quietly withdraw from this stone tower with Feng zun-zhe.</p><p>This place became completely silent after these two people withdrew. Only that purple-brown flame burned fiercely in a tireless manner. Xiao Yan, who was within the flame, was just like a phoenix bath in a flame, waiting for the moment that he would be reborn&#x2026;</p>
