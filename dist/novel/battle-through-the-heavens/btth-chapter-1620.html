<p><strong><u>Chapter 1620: Re-entering the Magma World</u></strong></p><p>Everyone make some brief introductions within the Meeting Room before taking their seats.</p><p>&#x201C;There have already been many factions within the Black-Corner Region, which had been turned into a bloodbath by the Hall of Soul. However, those fellows have already been eliminated.&#x201D; Xiao Yan looked at everyone before he slowly opened his mouth and said.</p><p>The face of Su Qian&#x2019;s group involuntarily twitched upon hearing this. Given these people&#x2019;s terrifying strength, it was not impossible to exterminate the entire Black-Corner Region.</p><p>&#x201C;The Black-Corner Region does not have a great enmity with them, does it?&#x201D; Su Qian laughed bitterly. The Hall of Soul was a faction of the Central Plains. There is seldom any interaction between this place and the Central Plains. Hence, they were unable to imagine why the Hall of Soul would do such a thing.</p><p>Xiao Yan exchanged glances with Mang Tian Chi before nodding his head. After which, he opened his mouth and summarised the occurrence on the Central Plains. This also included the current fight between the alliance and the Hun clan&#x2026;</p><p>&#x201C;You are really extraordinary. In over a decade, you have actually already reached this level.&#x201D; Su Qian&#x2019;s eyes watched Xiao Yan in surprise. Although Mang Tian Chi had only briefly mentioned some matter, Su Qian was still able to sense the soul-stirring incidents that had occurred.</p><p>Old Qian, Old Bai, Wu Hao and the others involuntarily nodded. When Xiao Yan had left back then, he was merely at the Dou Huang class. Now, however&#x2026; it was likely extremely hard to find any expert in this world who could match Xiao Yan.</p><p>This achievement really caused one to be amazed.</p><p>&#x201C;Base on what headmaster had said, the reason that the Black-Corner Region has end up attracting such a disaster is actually because of the magma world under our academy?&#x201D; Old Qian and Old Bai looked at each other before speaking with startled faces.</p><p>&#x201C;The bottom of the magma might have something that the Hun clan required.&#x201D; Mang Tian Chi nodded and replied, &#x201C;The Hun clan is usually ruthless. In order to successfully obtain what they want, they will kill all life within this Black-Corner Region. This is not a difficult task for them.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;The ones who had come this time around are merely the vanguard. Soon, it is likely that the Hun clan army will also arrive. At that time, there will definitely be an earthshaking big battle in this place. These students must not remain here.&#x201D; Xiao Yan said.</p><p>Su Qian and the others looked at each other and laughed bitterly. It was really a big trouble that had appeared from nowhere. This place was merely quietly teaching students. Who could have expected that it would attract such trouble. Moreover, the source of the trouble was actually the strongest faction on the Dou Qi continent&#x2026;</p><p>&#x201C;If it is not because all of you had arrived in time, it is likely that blood will really flow like river across the Black-Corner Region.&#x201D; Su Qian sighed quietly. They had also witnessed the techniques to those fellows from the Hun clan earlier. If it was not because Xiao Yan had appeared earlier, a mountain of corpses and a sea of blood would likely have been formed here.</p><p>&#x201C;First Elder, relax. The Hun clan might be powerful but my alliance army is not afraid of them. We will not allow them to easily destroy the Jis Nan Academy&#x2026;&#x201D; Xiao Yan smiled slightly and comforted.</p><p>&#x201C;The academy is a small matter. It is fine as long as everyone is alright.&#x201D; Su Qian shook his head. Immediately, his eyes looked towards Xiao Yan. There was a gentle and pleased expression in them as he said, &#x201C;After so many years of experience, that young fellow from back then had finally become a true expert&#x2026;&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Xiao Yan will always remember how First Elder has taught me back then.&#x201D; Xiao Yan softly said. His tone was sincere. From a certain point of view, Su Qian could be considered half of his teacher.</p><p>When the youth had arrived at the academy back then, Su Qian had given him much help in many matters. At that time, Xiao yan was merely a youth, who had carried some hatred and miserably fled from the Jia Nan Academy&#x2026;</p><p>&#x201C;Ha ha, since you have come to my academy, it is something that I ought to do.&#x201D; Su Qian waved his hand and laughed.</p><p>&#x201C;Hee hee, this little fellow is currently on equal terms as the clan head. Now that we put it this way, it seems that I am a little superior to him here.&#x201D; Mang Tian Chi by the side laughed strangely. He had already treated Xiao Yan as a monster. The first time they met was at the Empty Realm Lightning Pool. At that time, Xiao Yan was merely at the Dou Zun class. However, no one could imagine that within a short few years, the latter had already surpassed him the next time they met.</p><p>This speed caused even him to laugh bitterly and exclaim. After all, the name of the top person amongst the younger generation of the continent was definitely not an empty one. When he thought of how this top person had actually come from the Jia Nan Academy, Mang Tian Chi involuntarily felt a joy in his heart.</p><p>Xiao Yan shook his head helplessly. His expression was solemn as he said, &#x201C;Old Chi, you should pay more attention during this period of time. Once you discover the appearance of any experts from the Hun clan, you will issue a warning. The reinforcement of the alliance will gradually hurry over.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Xiao Yan ge-ge?&#x201D; Xun Er blinked her eyes and said.</p><p>&#x201C;I will head to the magma world.&#x201D; Xiao Yan&#x2019;s eyes hardened as he spoke in a deep voice. He must confirm just what strange aspect was present in the magma world below!</p><p>Su Qian was startled after hearing that Xiao Yan was about to venture deep into the magma world. However, he quickly relaxed the moment he thought of the terrifying strength of the former. Although the magma world was mysterious and unfathomable, it should not be difficult for her to escape unhurt with his strength.</p><p>&#x201C;Xiao Yan ge-ge, why don&#x2019;t I go down together with you?&#x201D; Xun Er knitted her brow and spoke in a somewhat worried manner. If the Ancient God Mansion was really present below, it would be difficult to predict the danger involved. After all, anything a Dou Di left behind would not be simple.</p><p>&#x201C;There are hardly any of us here. All of you should take care of the academy.&#x201D; Xiao Yan shook his head and smiled. &#x201C;Relax&#x2026;&#x201D;</p><p>With his current strength, even if there was really an expert comparable to Hun Tiandi at the bottom of the magma, he should be able to escape even if he could not defeat the other party.</p><p>Xun Er did not say anything more after seeing Xiao Yan&#x2019;s insistence. She simply nodded gently and voiced some reminders.</p><p>&#x201C;Let&#x2019;s not delay. I will leave immediately&#x2026;&#x201D;</p><p>Xiao Yan was someone who acted with lightning like speed. Since they had already made their decision, there was no need to waste time. Hence, he directly stood up.</p><p>Su Qian and the others exchanged glances upon seeing this before nodding slowly.</p><p>The bottom of the Blazing Sky Qi Refining Tower in the Inner Academy.</p><p>Xiao Yan stood at the entrance into the magma world. He suddenly beckoned with his hand and many invisible flames suddenly flew out from the Blazing Sky Qi Refining Tower before gathering into a cluster of invisible flame in his hand.</p><p>&#x201C;Falling Heart Flame. Ha ha, it has been so many years and it has grown quite a lot.&#x201D; Xiao Yan smiled as he looked at this invisible flame in his hand. This thing was the baby formed Fallen Heart Flame that he had found within the magma world back then. However, after growing for over a decade, it was clearly much stronger as compared to back then.</p><p>&#x201C;This little thing had consumed a great amount of our effort.&#x201D;</p><p>Su Qian laughed. In order to groom this Fallen Heart Flame, they had put in a great amount of hard work during these years. Fortunately, it was all worthwhile. The current Blazing Sky Qi Refining Tower was much more effective compared to back then. After all, that matured Fallen Heart Flame from back then would not listen to their orders. On the other hand, this current Fallen Heart Flame did not feel any resistance to their orders due to it being groomed by them over a prolong period of time.</p><p>Xiao Yan smiled and nodded. He flicked his finger and sent this Fallen Heart Flame, which was quivering in his hand, flying away. After which, he once again looked at Xun Er and the others. He said, &#x201C;Wait for me to return.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Aye. Be careful.&#x201D; Xun Er softly instructed after hearing this.</p><p>Xiao Yan smiled and did not continue to hesitate. His body flashed and turned into a black light which directly rushed into the magma world through the tunnel below.</p><p>The magma world was stilled completely crimson even after so many years. At a glance, one was still unable to see an end to it.</p><p>Xiao Yan was suspended above the magma. He lifted his hand to look at a dug out cave a short distance below. A smile was revealed on the corner of his mouth. It seemed that he had recalled the bitter days of training he had experienced in this place back then.</p><p>&#x201C;I have finally returned. However, this time around, I wish to see just what exactly is below!&#x201D;</p><p>A flash passed through Xiao Yan&#x2019;s eyes as he looked at the sea of magma below. The Purifying Demonic Lotus Flame surged out from within his body. Finally, it turned into a fire glow that rushed into the magma with a splash. It stirred waves of magma waves as it entered the magma.</p><p>&#x201C;Splash!&#x201D;</p><p>Xiao Yan swiftly ventured deep into the magma after Xiao Yan entered the magma. The surrounding magma would automatically be vaporised when they entered a five feet radius around him. With the might of the Purifying Demonic Lotus Flame, it was clear that these magma did not have the qualification to pose any obstruction.</p><p>Xiao Yan&#x2019;s current speed was many times faster compared to back then. Within less than ten minutes, he had gradually ventured deep into the magma. At the same time, his body had also become much slower. His expression was calm as he watched the surrounding of the magma. It was possible for him to sense that there was quite a lot of obscure auras swiftly approaching him.</p><p>&#x201C;That kind of magma creature huh&#x2026;&#x201D;</p><p>Xiao Yan smiled indifferently. His foot gently pressed under him. Immediately, a vast and mighty spiritual fluctuation surged from his brow. In an instant, the surrounding magma was blasted apart. Many figures hidden within the magma suddenly emitted a sharp miserable screech&#x2026;</p><p>&#x201C;Chi cui!&#x201D;</p><p>The magma fluctuation around Xiao Yan became even more intense after these screech sounded. After which, Xiao Yan saw the densely packed bright red figures rushing over from all directions and completely surrounding him.</p><p>Xiao Yan&#x2019;s eyes swept over these lizard like magma creatures. Finally, they paused at a spot a short distance away. Two completely cream white lizard people were standing there. They appeared much older than the other lizard people. The most surprising thing was that the strength of these two lizard people had actually reached the Ban Sheng class!</p><p>&#x201C;No wonder Tian Huo zun-zhe had ended up dying here back then. There are actually such existences amongst the lizard people.&#x201D; A sudden comprehension rose in Xiao Yan&#x2019;s eyes as he looked at the two lizard people. Immediately, he rejoiced slightly. Fortunately, he did not meet these people back then. Otherwise, it was likely that just a slap from these two would be able to kill him at that time.</p><p>&#x201C;Human, this is the tomb of the God. It is not a place where you should venture. Quickly return. Otherwise, you will end up dying here if you awaken its guardian!&#x201D;</p><p>One of the two white lizard people actually began to speak the human tongue while Xiao Yan was quietly feeling shocked. Although it appeared to be unfamiliar with the language, those words were still transmitted into Xiao Yan&#x2019;s ears.</p><p>&#x201C;Tomb of the God? Guardian?&#x201D;</p><p>Xiao Yan&#x2019;s eyes flashed upon hearing these two terms.</p>
