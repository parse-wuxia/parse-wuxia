<p><strong><u>Chapter 848: Old Man Ying Shan</u></strong></p><p>&#x201C;Old Ying Shan&#x2026;&#x201D;</p><p>Xiao Yan slowly inhaled a breath of air as his mouth softly emitted these words. The fists under his sleeves suddenly clenched. It was unexpected that he was unable to move the Black Emperor Sect despite having taken out a medicinal pill at the tier of the Zong Breaking Pill.</p><p>&#x201C;It seems that the item that that person took out is even more valuable than your Zong Breaking Pill.&#x201D; The Little Fairy Doctor by his side whispered with some surprise. It was unexpected that this inconspicuous old fellow would actually be able to take out something of this level.</p><p>Xiao Yan faintly nodded. Under the black robe, his gaze contained joy as it slowly shot toward the eagle-nosed old man. He frowned. Old Ying Shan? Was this the person&#x2019;s title within the &#x2018;Black-Corner Region&#x2019;? It was likely that he was an expert of the older generation. Otherwise, it was not possible for Xiao Yan to not have heard of him.</p><p>The silence within the large hall continued for a moment before a crushing uproar suddenly appeared. Countless numbers of stunned gazes looked at the gray-haired eagle-nosed old man who was seated in a corner. Numerous surprised cries involuntarily sounded within the auction grounds.</p><p>&#x201C;Old Ying Shan? The Old Ying Shan who was one of the top three on the Black Ranking back then? He is actually still alive?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;He never died. All he did was hide and undertake a retreat. Unexpectedly, we are able to see this strong person from the older generation who had shaken the &#x2018;Black-Corner Region&#x2019; back then. We have not wasted this trip.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;He was an expert at the peak of the Dou Huang class back then. After so many years, he definitely would make the breakthrough to the Dou Zong class, right?&#x201D;</p><p>Compared to the nosiness behind, the atmosphere in the VIP seats was covered in an unusual pressure. Numerous dense gazes were shot over from all directions. They immediately gathered onto old Ying Shan. Although the latter had quite a great reputation within the &#x2018;Black-Corner Region&#x2019;, any opponent would be ignored by them with the attraction of the Bodhisattva Body Transformation Saliva.</p><p>Old Ying Shan&#x2019;s expression did not change by even a little in front of the surrounding unfriendly gazes. His body gently leaned against the backrest of his chair while his expressionless old face revealed a fierce and brutal look. There was no soft person in a place like the &#x2018;Black-Corner Region&#x2019;. In order for him to become one of the top three peak experts on the Black Ranking back then, a countless number of people died by his hand. The Old Ying Shan back then was a person who had quite the fierce reputation. Although his fierce reputation had slightly reduced after he had undertaken a retreat in isolation for so many years, anyone who treated him as a softie who could be pinched would likely have to pay a hefty price.</p><p>Mo Tian Xing was still full of smiles as he stood on the auction stage. He acted like he was unable to feel a kind of strange atmosphere in the VIP seats as he smiled and said, &#x201C;Now that the Bodhisattva Body Transformation Saliva has an owner, this auction that my Black Emperor Sect has organized can smoothly come to a close. In the next few days, the Black Emperor Sect will hold a large banquet. Those who are interested can stay behind and join the fun. As for the customers who have bought something, my Black Emperor Sect will deliver the auction items to everyone without opening them during the next one to two days.&#x201D;</p><p>Old Ying Shan slowly stood up after Mo Tian Xing&#x2019;s voice sounded. After which, he slowly walked out of the VIP exit with an expressionless face in front of the rest of the VIPs.</p><p>People began to stand up from the VIP seats one after another after Old Ying Shan movement. All of them headed out of the auction ground. With his outstanding Spiritual Perception, Xiao Yan could sense that at least half of the people in the VIP seats had revealed some dark, cold killing intent.</p><p>&#x201C;The true goods show begins only now. It is likely that this subsequent period of time will be the real bloody storm&#x2026;&#x201D; Xiao Yan softly laughed. He immediately stood up and walked to the exit. The Little Fairy Doctor and Zi Yan followed close behind.</p><p>&#x201C;Ha ha, this friend.&#x201D; A laughter suddenly sounded from behind Xiao Yan just as he was about to exit.</p><p>Xiao Yan paused his footsteps. His black-robed body turned back and his indifferent gaze hidden by the black robe glanced at the people from the Demon Flame Valley who were walking toward him. A somewhat hoarse voice was immediately emitted, &#x201C;Is there something a matter?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Ha ha, the old me is the First Elder of the Demon Flame Valley, Fang Yan. May I inquire about this friend&#x2019;s name?&#x201D; Fang Yan smiled as he quickly walked forward. He cupped his hands to Xiao Yan before speaking in a friendly manner.</p><p>&#x201C;My first name is Yan. Does First Elder Fang Yan need something?&#x201D; Xiao Yan faintly inquired.</p><p>&#x201C;Ha ha, mister Yan&#x2019;s medicinal refining skills can be considered the best in this &#x2018;Black-Corner Region,&#x2019; right? The old me has only come to inquire if mister Yan also possesses an interest in the Bodhisattva Body Transformation Saliva?&#x201D; Fang Yan laughed. The topic immediately changed as he asked with a deep voice and overcast eyes.</p><p>&#x201C;Why?&#x201D; Xiao Yan&#x2019;s eyes under the black robe narrowed as he calmly asked.</p><p>&#x201C;If mister Yan also has some interest in the Bodhisattva Body Transformation Saliva, we might be able to cooperate. That Old Ying Shan is an expert in the &#x2018;Black-Corner Region&#x2019; from the older generation. He is extremely strong. If you were to act alone, it is likely that you will have difficulty snatching the Bodhisattva Body Transformation Saliva from that old fellow even if this young lady by your side intervenes.&#x201D; Fang Yan softly said.</p><p>The corner of Xiao Yan&#x2019;s mouth hidden by the black robe was lifted in ridicule. He immediately shook his head and said, &#x201C;I am not very interested in First Elder Fang Yan&#x2019;s suggestion. I&#x2019;m sorry&#x2026;&#x201D; Xiao Yan ceased speaking with Fang Yan after his words sounded. His gaze scanned the mysterious gray-robed person behind Fang Yan without anyone noticing. After which, he turned around and walked out of the tunnel.</p><p>A chill flashed across Fang Yan&#x2019;s eyes when he saw that Xiao Yan had completely rejected his suggestion.</p><p>&#x201C;This fellow is too arrogant. Does he think that he can defeat old Ying Shan alone by just possessing a Dou Zong by his side?&#x201D; The Elders from the Demon Flame Valley spoke somewhat angrily as they glared at Xiao Yan&#x2019;s back. Given the Demon Flame Valley&#x2019;s prestige within the &#x2018;Black-Corner Region&#x2019;, they had seldom received such treatment.</p><p>Fang Yan&#x2019;s expression sank. He immediately turned his head and looked at the mysterious gray-robed person. He inquired respectfully, &#x201C;Mister, what should we do now?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Everyone is targeting the Bodhisattva Body Transformation Saliva in this kind of situation. Hence, you can forget about having anyone trust and cooperate with you. You can only rely on yourselves. Although Old Ying Shan might be powerful, it is not as though we are helpless against him. Dispatch people to keep an eye on him during these two days. Prepare to act the moment he leaves the Black Emperor Sect!&#x201D; The gray robe trembled slightly as an illusionary aura and indifferent voice sounded.</p><p>Fang Yan nodded slightly upon hearing this. His gaze suddenly glanced at Xiao Li&#x2019;s and First Elder Su Qian&#x2019;s groups behind before softly asking, &#x201C;What about the people from &#x2018;Xiao Gate&#x2019; and the Jia Nan Academy?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Ignore them for now. The most important thing is the Bodhisattva Body Transformation Saliva.&#x201D; The gray-robed person spoke in an indifferent voice.</p><p>&#x201C;Yes&#x2026;&#x201D; Fang Yan nodded and ceased speaking any additional words. He waved his hand and lead his group of people slowly away from this enormous auction.</p><p>The atmosphere of the Black Emperor City seemed to have become more jubilant after the perfect end to the auction. Under the great banquet of the Black Emperor Sect, the entire city seemed to be covered in a joyous atmosphere. However, some sensitive people could faintly sense that an imminent bloody storm was surging under this joy.</p><p>Some factions did not leave after the auction ended. Instead, they quietly remained within the Black Emperor City. It seemed that they were enjoying the banquet of the Black Emperor Sect, but their gazes were quietly gathered on a single place, the living quarters of Old Ying Shan.</p><p>Xiao Yan&#x2019;s group appeared quite calm amid this anxious atmosphere which lingered in the shadows. They also aimed to get this Bodhisattva Body Transformation Saliva at all costs. However, they were not worried that Old Ying Shan would suddenly disappear. Under this kind of intense scrutiny, even an elite Dou Zong could not simply disappear without anyone noticing.</p><p>While they quietly waited for the situation to change, Xiao Yan lead the Little Fairy Doctor and Zi Yan over to the pickup location of the Black Emperor Sect the next day.</p><p>Mo Tian Xing naturally revealed his greatest warmth when Xiao Yan&#x2019;s group visited. He invited the three of them into the sect and served them in the grandest manner. That warmth caused Xiao Yan to feel somewhat uncomfortable.</p><p>After both parties had a brief chat, Mo Tian Xing seemed to have also sensed XIao Yan&#x2019;s impatience and immediately ceased saying any nonsense. He clapped his hands and brought out all of the items that Xiao Yan bought in the auction one at a time, including the Magical Beast corpse.</p><p>&#x201C;Ha ha, mister Yan Xiao, all the items that you have auctioned for are located here. Please check them yourself.&#x201D; Mo Tian Xing smiled as he spoke. He glanced at the Magical Beast corpse that had occupied over half of the hall.</p><p>Xiao Yan did not show any pretence as he nodded. After which, he carefully examined all of the auctioned items once. This was especially the case for that Magical Beast corpse. He had spent quite a lot of time on it but did not find anything wrong. Only then did he nod his head. He slowly took out the gold coins and medicinal pills from his Storage Ring before gently placing them on the table.</p><p>&#x201C;Sect leader Mo, please check these things.&#x201D;</p><p>Mo Tian Xing took a glance before waving his large hand while he smiled and said, &#x201C;There is no need to check. The old me trusts mister Yan Xiao.&#x201D;</p><p>Xiao Yan smiled faintly after hearing this. He said, &#x201C;In that case, I will bid you goodbye.&#x201D; Xiao Yan turned around and left after speaking. Mo Tian Xing hurriedly stepped forward when he saw this. He dryly laughed, &#x201C;Mister Yan Xiao, please wait for a moment.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;What is it?&#x201D; Xiao Yan knit his brows slightly, turned around, and asked.</p><p>&#x201C;Ha ha&#x2026;&#x201D; Mo Tian Xing awkwardly smiled. He immediately rubbed his hands and said, &#x201C;Mister Yan Xiao, may this old me inquire if I can exchange for that Zong Breaking Pill in your hands?&#x201D;</p><p>The corner of Xiao Yan&#x2019;s mouth was immediately lifted into a cold smile when he heard this. This old fellow was indeed having some thoughts about the Zong Breaking Pill in his possession.</p>
