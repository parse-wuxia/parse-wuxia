<p><strong><u>Chapter 872: Reaching Peace Town</u></strong></p><p>A quiet, small town was located on the intersection between the &#x2018;Black-Corner Region&#x2019; and the Jia Nan Academy. The sunlight from the sky scattered down and lit up the horizontal inscription on the board that hung above the entrance of the small town. Three somewhat ordinary words that did not have any murderous aura appeared under the sunlight, allowing one to feel calm.</p><p>&#x201C;Peace Town!&#x201D;</p><p>The hearts of Xiao Yan&#x2019;s group appeared to have released a large rock as they ascended a hill and looked down on the small town below. A long breath was slowly exhaled from his mouth before gradually turning into nothingness. This journey was really somewhat tortuous.</p><p>&#x201C;Let&#x2019;s go, there will no longer be anyone giving chase after we enter Peace Town&#x2026; the Jia Nan Academy has already received the message, and there are quite a number of experts in the small town prepared to receive us.&#x201D; Su Qian&#x2019;s gaze was slowly withdrawn from the small town as he spoke with a smile.</p><p>Xiao Yan gently nodded. He turned his head slightly to look back. There were still human figures drifting not far behind as numerous greedy and dissatisfied glances were shot from the dark corners.</p><p>&#x201C;This is really a group of people who have quite the perseverance.&#x201D; A cold smile surfaced on Xiao Yan&#x2019;s mouth as he shook his head. He ignored them as he waved his hand. His body leaped down from the hilltop, and transformed into a black shadow that took the lead to rush toward Peace Town. Following behind him, the experts from &#x2018;Xiao Gate&#x2019; and the Jia Nan Academy emitted numerous laughs. Those fellows behind them had caused them to feel disgust and irritation throughout the journey.</p><p>Numerous dissatisfied gazes watched as Xiao Yan&#x2019;s group rushed over to the small town. However, all they could do was grit their teeth before gradually scattering. Only some stubborn fellows continue to dwell in this place. They hoped a special situation would occur to allow them to gain some advantage.</p><p>However, the situation they hoped for did not happen. Xiao Yan&#x2019;s group successfully entered Peace Town before disappearing from their sight&#x2026;</p><p>A gray-robed, human figure stepped on tree branches and stood in the air atop an enormous tree. The dense eyes under the gray robe focused on Xiao Yan&#x2019;s group backs, which had become distant. A moment later, the figure raised his head slightly and revealed a dark, cold yet familiar face. It was surprisingly Han Feng.</p><p>&#x201C;My good junior. This senior will not give up so easily. Just wait. After killing the Demon Flame Valley&#x2019;s three Elders, your good days have already come to an end. For now&#x2026; I will allow you to enjoy your time!&#x201D; A dense chill lifted the corners of Han Feng&#x2019;s mouth as he coldly laughed in a soft voice.</p><p>A strange smile that could penetrate a person was also revealed under the gray robe after the cold laughter sounded. However, the human figure slowly became illusionary and finally scattered into nothingness.</p><p>Xiao Yan&#x2019;s group had just entered &#x2018;Peace Town&#x2019;, when the sound of humans moving through the air appeared. Within a short moment, the top of the buildings where Xiao Yan&#x2019;s group had appeared were filled with cautious people. The caution on these human figures&#x2019; faces swiftly scattered when they saw Su Qian, and a joy that was difficult to hide replaced it.</p><p>&#x201C;Its First Elder and the others. They are back!&#x201D;</p><p>The joyous cry swiftly spread through the small town. Immediately over ten human figures with powerful auras rushed out of the small town. They appeared in front of Xiao Yan&#x2019;s group in the blink of an eye. Looking at the badges on their chests, they were surprisingly Elders of the academy.</p><p>&#x201C;Old fellow, you are finally back. If we did not hear any information from you within two days, I was planning to lead some people into the &#x2018;Black-Corner Region&#x2019; to search for you.&#x201D; An old yet powerful voice suddenly sounded from behind after the appearance of these ten plus Elders. Immediately, a lively old man took big strides forward. The surrounding Elders who saw him hurriedly made a path.</p><p>&#x201C;Hu Gan, why is it that you are still so unceremonious&#x2026; if you don&#x2019;t control your temper, you will have to wait an unknown amount of time before you advance to the Dou Zong class.&#x201D; Su Qian smiled and replied when he saw this old fellow whom Xiao Yan was quite familiar with.</p><p>&#x201C;Chi, what does advancing to the Dou Zong class have to do with temper.&#x201D; Hu Gan curled his mouth. His gaze immediately paused on Xiao Yan. He observed him a little before letting out a praise from his mouth, &#x201C;How unexpected. Little fellow, when you had first entered Peace Town back then, you were merely a Da Dou Shi. Within a couple of years, you have actually become an expert Dou Huang&#x2026; this training speed, it is unlikely that there is anyone who could surpass you even in the Jia Nan Academy.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Xiao Yan greets deputy headmaster.&#x201D; Xiao Yan smiled when he heard this. He quickly cupped his hand to Hu Gan and respectfully responded.</p><p>&#x201C;Alright, why are you acting like an outsider? Moreover, with your current ability, I am not worthy of you being so polite.&#x201D; Hu Gan might have spoken in this manner but from the look of the smiling expression on his face, it was clear that he was pleased with Xiao Yan&#x2019;s manners. He fondled his chin, and turned his head to the people on the roof, who were sweeping the place with curious gazes, before crying out loud, &#x201C;Little brats, this is the chief of &#x2018;Pan&#x2019;s Gate&#x2019;, Xiao Yan, from the Inner Academy, whom all of you have frequently mentioned. However, he is a genuine expert Dou Huang. Do you know &#x2018;Xiao Gate&#x2019;? The faction that has frequently dispatched experts to protect all of you each time you head to the &#x2018;Black-Corner Region&#x2019; to train? That is also something that he established. He is different from you people who still need others to protect you.&#x201D;</p><p>All the people on the roofs were startled when they heard Hu Gan&#x2019;s voice. A strong glint suddenly erupted from their eyes as their gazes carefully weighed Xiao Yan. Private conversations repeatedly spread like a pile of houseflies.</p><p>&#x201C;Is he senior Xiao Yan? He is indeed extremely young. Moreover, he looks quite handsome, and is better looking than the statute.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Hee hee, do you have a crush? However, there are quite a number of people within the academy who possess good feelings mixed with curiosity for this mysterious senior. This sister of yours is also your greatest competitor.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Chi&#x2026;&#x201D; Waves of lovely silver-bell-like laughs erupted while these two young ladies, who looked quite similar, were arguing. Their extremely pretty waistlines, that became visible during their laughter, caused quite a number of male students to throw their gazes over.</p><p>&#x201C;It is unexpected that senior Xiao Yan has become an expert Dou Huang at such a young age. He is indeed worthy of being the founder of &#x2018;Pan&#x2019;s Gate&#x2019;&#x2026;&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Currently, &#x2018;Pan&#x2019;s Gate&#x2019; is the strongest faction within the Jia Nan Academy. Over thirty spots on the Inner Academy&#x2019;s top fifty Strong Ranking belong to the members of &#x2018;Pan&#x2019;s Gate&#x2019;. Moreover, even a couple of Elders held positions in &#x2018;Pan&#x2019;s Gate&#x2019;. This strength is something that not a single faction can surpass even now&#x2026;&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;...&#x201D;</p><p>Even with Xiao Yan&#x2019;s thick skin, his face involuntarily turned a little red when he heard the many private conversations and felt the unusual gazes thrown over. This was especially because of the sparkling fiery eyes of some young girls and their appearance of being unable to contain themselves, wanting to throw themselves over. It was unexpected that there were still some people in the Jia Nan Academy who remembered him after having been gone for two years. However, his tensed heart had quietly relaxed when he sensed the vigor and liveliness from those young men and women. His heart involuntarily let out a quiet sigh, &#x201C;It is good to be young&#x2026;&#x201D;</p><p>When he spoke these words, he seemed to have forgotten that he was actually not much older than these young men and women.</p><p>&#x201C;Hee hee, little fellow, in the many years since the establishment of the Jia Nan Academy, there have been very few people who have achieved such respect in this place where the talented gather. You have also lived in this place for a couple of years and should know that the students here are elites who have come from many different places. All of them are haughty in nature. It is quite difficult to gain such approval from them.&#x201D; Hu Gan patted Xiao Yan&#x2019;s shoulder and laughed.</p><p>Xiao Yan could only smile awkwardly in the face of Hu Gan&#x2019;s words.</p><p>Hu Gan sighed to himself, appearing to have not seen Xiao Yan&#x2019;s expression, &#x201C;When you arrived at the Jia Nan Academy back then, the old me had sensed that you were not an ordinary person. Looking at it now, it seems that my eyesight is as sharp as it has always been.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Old fellow, stop trying to boast&#x2026;&#x201D; Su Qian helplessly shook his head by the side. He waved his hand and said, &#x201C;Let&#x2019;s return to the Jia Nan Academy first. Instruct the Law Enforcement Unit to tighten our defenses during this period of time. There is no need to report anyone who tries to forcefully enter from the &#x2018;Black-Corner Region.&#x2019; Just attack them.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;This order has long since been given. The allure of the Bodhisattva Body Transformation Saliva is really quite great&#x2026; this is?&#x201D; Hu Gan nodded his head before his eyes suddenly turned to the Little Fairy Doctor beside Xiao Yan. The vague aura that seeped out of the latter&#x2019;s body caused him to feel somewhat pressured. This kind of feeling was something that he had only occasionally sensed from Su Qian. However, it was far from this intense. Hence, Hu Gan immediately smiled as he inquired in a random manner.</p><p>&#x201C;She is called the Little Fairy Doctor, my friend.&#x201D; Xiao Yan smiled as he replied.</p><p>Hu Gan was startled when he heard this. He immediately let out a bitter laugh and sighed, &#x201C;You little fellow. Even the people around you are not ordinary individuals. You are indeed no longer that tender little fellow from back then&#x2026;&#x201D; Hu Gan sighed emotionally and turned his head before yelling at all the people on the roof. &#x201C;All right, all of you can disperse. The people from the Law Enforcement Unit will stay behind and patrol.&#x201D;</p><p>The many students scattered somewhat unwillingly after hearing Hu Gan shout. However, their gazes still paused a little longer on Xiao Yan before they left. Only after that did they disperse.</p><p>&#x201C;Let&#x2019;s go. Follow me back to the Jia Nan Academy. The Inner Academy&#x2019;s &#x2018;Blazing Sky Qi Refining Tower&#x2019; still requires you to activate it once again. Moreover, I think that you should also go and take a look at your &#x2018;Pan&#x2019;s Gate&#x2019; after your two year absence. After all, you are its founder.&#x201D; Su Qian finally sighed in relief as he watched everyone leave, feeling that things had become much quieter. After which, he turned his head and spoke with a smile to Xiao Yan.</p><p>Xiao Yan smiled and nodded. He raised his head and looked to the location of the Jia Nan Academy in the distance. His heart also let out a quiet sigh. After two years, he had finally returned to this place where he had gradually transformed from a tender, young man into an expert&#x2026;</p><p>&#x201C;&#x2018;Pan&#x2019;s Gate&#x2019;, I wonder how it is?&#x201D;</p><p>Xiao Yan&#x2019;s heart quietly became fiery hot as he thought of this young faction he had established.</p>
