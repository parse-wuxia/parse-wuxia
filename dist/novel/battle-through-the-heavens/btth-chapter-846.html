<p><strong><u>Chapter 846: Each Revealing One&#x2019;s Capital</u></strong></p><p>The enormous auction ground descended into an unusual silence after Mo Tian Xing&#x2019;s words sounded. A countless number of eyes swept over those in the VIP seats. Everyone knew that given the great value of this Bodhisattva Body Transformation Saliva, it was naturally impossible for an ordinary person to obtain. Those who had the qualification and ability to obtain it were the experts and ancient factions present in the VIP seats.</p><p>The VIP seats were strangely quiet. Even those large factions, that were ready to create trouble earlier, did not open their mouths in a frantic manner. Instead, their bodies leaned gently against the backrest of their chairs as their fingers gently knocked on their armrests. They did not open their mouths to say anything.</p><p>&#x201C;Ha ha, it is this old me who has not made myself clear.&#x201D;</p><p>Mo Tian Xing was also startled by this unusual silence. Immediately, he appeared to have recovered as he softly laughed and said, &#x201C;Due to this Bodhisattva Body Transformation Saliva being far too valuable, the auctioning method will also be somewhat different. Next, I will like to invite those friends who are interested to enter the auction stage alone and take out the item they wish to use in exchange for the old me to take a look. After which, the old me will complete this transaction with the person who has taken out an item of the greatest value.&#x201D;</p><p>Quite a number of people were stunned when they heard Mo Tian Xing&#x2019;s words. Plenty of people immediately became displeased. Despite being displeased, they were clear that given the value of this Bodhisattva Body Transformation Saliva, the items that these large factions would take out to exchange for it would also be extremely valuable. As the saying went, money cannot be revealed to anyone. This point was something that even commoners knew, much less these large factions and experts who shook the &#x2018;Black-Corner Region&#x2019;.</p><p>Xiao Yan was similarly startled by this rule. However, he recovered quickly and nodded. In this way, he would be able to save some trouble. After all, if the thing that one took out was so valuable that the people beside them started to covet it, it might end up attracting quite a lot of unnecessary trouble.</p><p>Those people who had similar thoughts as Xiao Yan, revealed a more relaxed expression on their faces. They nodded after Mo Tian Xing&#x2019;s words sounded.</p><p>Mo Tian Xing glanced at the atmosphere that had relaxed a little. Only then did he vaguely smile. His hand suddenly moved and the surrounding light circle around the auction stage suddenly became denser. With the increase in density of the color, the situation within the stage grew increasingly blurrier. In the end, one could not make out anything on the stage.</p><p>Mo Tian Xing&#x2019;s loud and clear laughter was transmitted as the auction stage was being covered by a dense light pillar, &#x201C;Everyone, I think you should be able to rest assured now, right? In that case, please start bidding. However, everyone should follow the rules. It is sufficient to enter alone. Do not enter in groups. Of course, I think that everyone need not worry that the old me will mess about in front of everyone.&#x201D;</p><p>Quite a number of people faintly smiled when they heard these words of Mo Tian Xing. If the Black Emperor Sect dared to mess around in this kind of place, it was likely that they did not wish to continue muddling along in the &#x2018;Black-Corner Region&#x2019;? Some of the factions seated had a background that was not weaker than the Black Emperor Sect. If the latter were to annoy them, the Black Emperor Sect&#x2019;s could only end up being destroyed should all of them form an alliance.</p><p>A middle-aged man in a VIP seat took the lead to stand not long after Mo Tian Xing&#x2019;s words sounded. His face was filled with a fiery heat as his body moved and rushed forward. Finally, he entered into the light pillar.</p><p>Xiao Yan, who was under the black robe, could not resist playing with the Storage Ring on his finger as he watched the middle-aged man disappear into the light pillar. He had spent all his effort to prepare for this Bodhisattva Body Transformation Saliva. However, he did not know whether his fortune would be able to obtain it from the hands of so many experts who had clearly come prepared.</p><p>&#x201C;Why don&#x2019;t I go in later?&#x201D; The Little Fairy Doctor by his side suddenly whispered to Xiao Yan. She was knitting her brows while staring at the dense light pillar.</p><p>&#x201C;It&#x2019;s fine, the Black Emperor Sect doesn&#x2019;t have the guts to mess around here&#x2026; moreover, given my strength, even if Mo Tian Xing were to attack in person, he would have difficulty getting me to stay without revealing some ability.&#x201D; Xiao Yan faintly smiled. He naturally knew what the Little Fairy Doctor was worried about. However, as long as that Mo Tian Xing was somewhat rational, he would not commit a foolish act in front of so many people&#x2019;s eyes.</p><p>The Little Fairy Doctor could only nod her head when she saw Xiao Yan&#x2019;s persistence. She softly said, &#x201C;In that case, we&#x2019;ll do as you say. However, you should remember that I will force my way in if you did not come out within five minutes.&#x201D;</p><p>Xiao Yan was startled before he immediately smiled and nodded.</p><p>Around three minutes later, the large middle-aged man walked out of the pillar in front of the countless numbers of gazes in the auction. He helplessly shook his head and returned to his seat with a bitter face. From the looks of it, the item he had taken out was not approved by Mo Tian Xing.</p><p>The people in the VIP seats who felt uncertainty in their hearts finally let it go after seeing the first person successfully walk out. Next, a yellow-clothed, old man with a shadowy expression swiftly stood up and rushed into the light pillar.</p><p>The remainder of the auction was unusually smooth after its bumpy start. People repeatedly entered the light pillar one after another. However, most people ended up coming out with a somewhat gloomy expression. It seemed that their things also failed to satisfy Mo Tian Xing. Of course, this was not the case for everyone. There was a small number of people who walked out with smiles on their faces. It seemed that they possessed a lot of confidence in the things that they had taken out.</p><p>Xiao Yan was not in a hurry to enter the light pillar. Instead, he quietly sat in his chair, and watched the progress of the event.</p><p>The eagle-nosed gray-haired old man, who had purchased the &#x2018;Dark Shadow Skill&#x2019; earlier, slowly stood up while Xiao Yan quietly waited.</p><p>Xiao Yan&#x2019;s heart shivered a little when he saw the old man act. The latter was one of the few people in the auction ground whom he could not see through. Therefore, his heart had automatically classified him among his greatest competitors.</p><p>This eagle-nosed gray-haired old man seemed to possess some reputation among the older generation of the &#x2018;Black-Corner Region&#x2019;. Hence, the expressions of the people from the Demon Flame Valley, First Elder Su Qian and the others, who had yet to step forward, changed slightly the moment the former stood up. Their gazes were quickly shot over.</p><p>The eagle-nosed old man was unconcerned with these surrounding gazes. His body shook and he disappeared from the spot in a ghost-like manner. This speed caused Xiao Yan&#x2019;s eyes to shrink. At this moment, he was certain that this old man, whose aura was different from an ordinary Dou Zong, was definitely an elite Dou Zong!</p><p>&#x201C;The &#x2018;Black-Corner Region&#x2019; is indeed a place where dragons and tigers hide. I never heard of this person in the past. It is unexpected that his strength is this great&#x2026;&#x201D; Xiao Yan&#x2019;s face became solemn under the black robe while he muttered in his heart.</p><p>The space where the eagle-nosed old man had disappeared from shook slightly just as this thought flashed across Xiao Yan&#x2019;s heart. One could see that his body flashed and appeared once again. His face contained a faint smile. From the looks of it, it seemed that he had great confidence in his bidding price.</p><p>After having flashed and returned, the eagle-nosed old man continued to ignore the surrounding gazes as he returned to his seat. After which, he shut his eyes to recuperate.</p><p>Quite a number of people frowned when they saw his laid back movements&#x2026;</p><p>First Elder Fang Yan from the Demon Flame Valley finally stood up after this mysterious eagle-nosed old man&#x2019;s turn. His face carried a smile as he slowly walked out a moment after entering the light pillar. From the looks of it, he seemed to have also brought along a true treasure.</p><p>Xiao Yan studied Fang Yan with an indifferent expression as the latter returned to his seat. He was just about to stand up when he saw Xiao Li, a short distance away, got up before him. After which, the latter&#x2019;s body moved and he rushed into the light pillar.</p><p>Xiao Yan was immediately stunned upon seeing this scene. The aim of &#x2018;Xiao Gate&#x2019; this time around was also the Bodhisattva Body Transformation Saliva? However, given the foundation of &#x2018;Xiao Gate,&#x2019; how was it able to take out something that could interest Mo Tian Xing? Xiao Yan&#x2019;s eyes suddenly glanced at First Elder Su Qian as this doubt flashed across his heart. He immediately nodded his head, having come to a sudden understanding.</p><p>Xiao Li walked out after having entered the light pillar for three to four minutes. His appearance did not reveal a bitter expression nor too many smiles. It seemed that the Black Emperor Sect did not evaluate the thing that they had taken out very highly.</p><p>Xiao Yan slowly stood up as this thought flashed through his heart.</p><p>Being a target who was always paid attention to, Xiao Yan&#x2019;s actions naturally pulled over many gazes that contained various expressions.</p><p>These gazes were naturally not something that Xiao Yan was bothered with. His body moved and he gently floated through the air before landing in the light pillar.</p><p>The intense light when Xiao Yan&#x2019;s body entered the light pillar caused his eyes to narrow before he opened them with caution a moment later. He coincidentally saw Mo Tian Xing smiling on the auction stage. There was a red-faced old man behind the latter. He was Qi Shan, whom Xiao Yan had some conflict with.</p><p>&#x201C;Ha ha, mister Yan Xiao. The old me has finally waited for you to step forward.&#x201D; Mo Tian Xing smiled as he spoke. He studied Xiao Yan. The gaze he used to look at the latter was no different than one used to look at a big fat goat.</p><p>Xiao Yan quietly and coldly laughed at Mo Tian Xing&#x2019;s eyes. His gaze immediately turned to the crystal box by the side without drawing attention. Surprise flickered in his eyes when he saw the thick liquid within it. It seemed to possess a lifeforce of its own. He muttered, &#x201C;Is this the Bodhisattva Body Transformation Saliva?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Ha ha, this is the Bodhisattva Body Transformation Saliva. My Black Emperor Sect does not dare to create a fake of this thing.&#x201D; Mo Tian Xing smiled and nodded. He immediately laughed, &#x201C;May I know what does mister Yan Xiao intend to use to exchange for this Bodhisattva Body Transformation Saliva?&#x201D;</p><p>Xiao Yan withdrew his gaze. He mused for a moment under Mo Tian Xing&#x2019;s somewhat fiery hot gaze. With a flick of his finger, a white jade bottle appeared in his hand. There was a large dragon-eye-sized medicinal pill partially visible in the jade bottle.</p><p>&#x201C;This is a top grade tier 6 medicinal pill, Zong Breaking Pill. I think that sect leader Mo has heard of it. I shall not say anything more about its effect.&#x201D;</p><p>Xiao Yan flicked his finger and the jade bottle slowly flew toward Mo Tian Xing while Xiao Yan spoke.</p><p>&#x201C;Zong Breaking Pill?&#x201D;</p><p>Mo Tian Xing and Qi Shan behind him trembled upon hearing this name. A joy that was difficult to hide immediately surfaced in their eyes.</p>
