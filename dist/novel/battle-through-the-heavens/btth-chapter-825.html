<p><strong><u>Chapter 825: Red-Faced Elder</u></strong></p><p>&#x201C;It is indeed worthy of being the &#x2018;Black-Corner Region&#x2019;... within a day, two alchemists of such tier have appeared&#x2026; it looks like I really did not come here for nothing today.&#x201D;</p><p>The appearance of this red-faced elder caused the voices of the many alchemist in the hall to become much softer. Some of those whose abilities were a little stronger displayed somewhat unnatural expressions.</p><p>Owner Yao on the stage was slightly startled. A warm smile was immediately pushed onto her face as she hurriedly descended the stage and headed to the red-faced elder. Her mouth laughed in a loving manner, &#x201C;Old Qi is honoring us with his presence. This time around, the Black Emperor City is holding a large-scale auction and I thought that Old Qi will not have the spare time to come&#x2026;&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Hee hee, what is Owner Yao saying? The quality of the medicinal ingredients in the Thousand Medicinal House is extraordinary. Even the old me cannot help but feel interested. Moreover, this Pill Exchange Gathering is not frequently held. Therefore, the old me will definitely come over and take a look regardless of how busy I am.&#x201D; The old man who was addressed as Old Qi laughed out loud. His voice was extremely clear. When he laughed loudly, quite a number of people within the hall knit their brows. However, due to the former&#x2019;s position and background within the Black Emperor City, no one dared to voice their thoughts.</p><p>&#x201C;Qie-shen is extremely happy that Old Qi is able to come visit this store. Fortunately, this Pill Exchange Gathering has yet to formally start. Old Qi, please take a sit.&#x201D; Owner Yao smiled as she spoke. She immediately inclined her body and made a respectfully inviting stance.</p><p>TL: Qie-shen - A humble way in which a woman calls herself. For simplicity, it can be taken as the word I/me</p><p>Seeing this, the red-faced elder bluntly let out a loud laugh and unceremoniously headed to the row in front of the stage. After which, he sat down on a chair at the most important spot. His faint gaze took one look around before finally pausing for a moment on Xiao Yan, who was a short distance away. After which, he immediately withdrew his gaze.</p><p>Owner Yao let out a soft sigh without anyone noticing after seeing that the red-faced elder had sat down. Her heart quietly cursed, &#x201C;Each time this old fellow comes, he always rely on his background within the Black Emperor City which causes the other competitors to be afraid of bidding against him.&#x201D;</p><p>This red-faced elder had quite the powerful background. He was the top alchemist within the Black Emperor Sect. It was rumored that he had reached the 6th tier not long ago. He could be considered to be the person who had the greatest medicinal refining ability within the Black Emperor City. Moreover, by relying on the strength of the Black Emperor Sect, he could be considered an important person whose words mattered greatly to everyone in the Black Emperor City. An ordinary person naturally did not dare to bid against him. In this way, it was undoubtedly not something good from the Thousand Medicinal House point of view. After all, they required both parties to bid against each other in order to maximize their profits. The actions of the former undoubtedly broke the rules.</p><p>Although Owner Yao felt dissatisfaction, she did not dare to say too much because of the influence of the red-faced elder within the Black Emperor City. Therefore, she did not feel much joy for this big fellow who had come uninvited.</p><p>&#x201C;This old fellow has sharp eyes. I wonder what medicinal ingredient he will take away this time around&#x2026;&#x201D; Owner Yao&#x2019;s hand involuntarily tightened under her sleeves. These medicinal ingredients were obtained after their Thousand Medicinal House had risked the lives of quite a number of medicinal harvesters. That price was quite great&#x2026;</p><p>Owner Yao shook her head slightly as these thoughts flashed across her heart. She suppressed the emotions in her heart before swiftly walking back to the tall stage. A smile once again surged onto her face as she began to host this Pill Exchange Gathering.</p><p>Xiao Yan&#x2019;s group sat at a spot toward the back. The medicinal ingredients that had appeared earlier were not those that he needed, and his gaze had paused on the red-faced elder most of the time. From the expressions of the surrounding alchemists when this old man appeared earlier, it seemed that he possessed quite a high position within the Black Emperor City. Another thing was that this person did not seem likable. However, many people did not dare to voice their anger due to some reason.</p><p>By relying on his outstanding Spiritual Perception, Xiao Yan could sense that this red-faced elder&#x2019;s alchemist tier was likely a little higher than Yan Alliance&#x2019;s Fa Ma. However, when compared to Gu He, he would likely appear a little weaker. He could be considered a genuine alchemist grandmaster that would be greatly sought after by many competing factions within the &#x2018;Black-Corner Region&#x2019;.</p><p>The so-called Pill Exchange Gathering had formally began while these thoughts lingered in Xiao Yan&#x2019;s heart. Some of the alchemists&#x2019; gazes swept over the medicinal ingredients on display. Should they discover anything suitable, they would step forward. However, in order to take the medicinal ingredients they were interested in, they would need to pay with a medicinal pill that was of similar value to the medicinal ingredient.</p><p>Xiao Yan faintly understood something as he observed this Pill Exchange Gathering. He discovered that the value of these medicinal ingredients was about half or less of the value of the medicinal pill that they could be refined into. For example, if it was a medicinal ingredient that could refine a tier 4 medicinal pill, one would need a tier 3 medicinal pill in order to successfully exchange for it. However, what kind of tier 3 medicinal pill was decided by the Thousand Medicinal House. If the person had already prepared it for the business, that person could just exchange for the medicinal ingredient. If he had not, there was a medicinal cauldron of quite a high grade prepared for them on a rock platform by the side. Clearly, it was for people to refine the pill on the spot.</p><p>The first batch of medicinal ingredients did not enter Xiao Yan&#x2019;s discerning eyes. However, there were still quite a number of tier 3 and tier 4 alchemists who were interested in them. After which, they began the exchange according to the rules. If these people did not possess a ready-made medicinal pill, some of the alchemists would resort to refining them on the spot. In an instant, the temperature of the hall rose. Some of the people who were not interested in the first batch of medicinal ingredients merely turned their eyes to the flame rising in the medicinal cauldron. They would observe the refining methods of other people while feeling bored.</p><p>Xiao Yan&#x2019;s group randomly watched the other alchemists refining pills on the spot in their boredom. Not long after that, Xiao Yan withdrew his gaze and shook his head. With his current ability, the refining methods of the alchemists at these tiers appeared very simple and crude in his eyes. There was not the slightest thing for him to learn from them.</p><p>There were also quite a number of alchemists who sat in the hall without moving. The ability of these people could be considered the middle to upper levels of this place. Therefore, their sights were placed a little higher. This first batch of lower quality medicinal ingredients obviously could not attract them. The ones who felt the greatest leisure among them was naturally that red-faced elder. His face was nearly filled with impatience while viewing these medicinal ingredients that he was completely uninterested in. From his appearance, it was as though he could not wait for the Thousand Medicinal House to immediately take out the highest quality medicinal ingredients.</p><p>Following the slow flow of time, these lower quality medicinal ingredients were gradually selected and taken away. After which, more medicinal ingredients continued to appear. Their quality became better and better. Those somewhat stronger alchemists who were originally sitting in their seats without moving finally began to show interest. They started to move forward to negotiate the exchange of items.</p><p>The medicinal ingredients on the rock platform diminished as time passed. However, from the dense medicinal fragrances that was seeped from these jade boxes, one could tell that the medicinal ingredients were of a high quality. Some of those even caused the red-faced elder to be moved. However, he did not do anything. From the looks of it, he seemed to have come prepared this time around.</p><p>When the medicinal ingredients on the rock platform were reduced to less than ten boxes, there were only a few people left still sitting in their seats without moving. This included Xiao Yan and that red-faced elder.</p><p>The red-faced elder was startled when he saw that Xiao Yan&#x2019;s group did not move. He immediately frowned and glanced at Xiao Yan.</p><p>Xiao Yan turned his head slightly when he sensed that gaze being shot over. Their eyes made contact. A moment later, Xiao Yan turned away as though nothing had happened. His face did not even reveal the slightest fear that the other alchemists displayed when they looked at the red-faced elder.</p><p>This calm attitude of Xiao Yan caused the red-faced, old man to be startled. His heart gained some fury. With his current ability and reputation, it had been a long time since he had tasted the feeling of being ignored by another.</p><p>The alchemists who had obtained the medicinal ingredients that they needed did not leave the hall. Instead, they glanced at Xiao Yan and the red-faced elder who were still seated in their seats with interested gazes. Normally speaking, the last part of this kind of Pill Exchange Gathering was the true high point&#x2026;</p><p>&#x201C;He he, next will be a batch of medicinal ingredients that is of the highest quality within my Thousand Medicinal House. Our Thousand Medicinal House has paid an extremely great price for these medicinal ingredients&#x2026;&#x201D; Owner Yao smiled as she looked at the few remaining jade boxes on the rock platform. She softly clapped her hands, and a couple of female servants hurried out. After which, they removed the remaining jade boxes and brought over five emerald-jade boxes.</p><p>A dense medicinal fragrance suddenly drifted over the large hall when these five jade boxes appeared. Quite a number of alchemists gently inhaled as surprise surged onto their faces.</p><p>The red-faced elder, who was leaning against his chair, stood up at this moment. His eyes were somewhat fiery hot as he looked at the jade boxes.</p><p>Owner Yao&#x2019;s eyes swept over the hall and immediately paused on Xiao Yan. She laughed, &#x201C;If the few of you are interested in these five medicinal ingredients, please bid for them.&#x201D;</p><p>Xiao Yan&#x2019;s gaze was currently staring intently at three jade boxes on the stage. Within his eyesight, he was naturally able to see that the interior of these three jade boxes were the targets of his trip. They were the last three medicinal ingredients needed to refine the &#x2018;Heaven Soul Blood Bone Pill&#x2019;.</p><p>Xiao Yan inhaled a deep breath of air and stood up under the gaze of everyone in the hall. Finally, he strode over to the rock platform.</p><p>The gazes in the hall immediately gathered on Xiao Yan after seeing this action of his. The quality of these few medicinal ingredients were extremely high. If one wanted to exchange for them, it was likely that one must take out a tier 4 or tier 5 medicinal pill. Could this fellow who seemed extremely young take out a medicinal pill of such tier?</p><p>Xiao Yan stopped in front of the rock platform in front of the many gazes. He smiled toward the slim and attractive Owner Yao before slowly pulling three jade boxes in front of him. He said, &#x201C;Owner Yao, please tell me just what kind of medicinal pill I need to create in order to exchange for these three medicinal ingredients.&#x201D;</p><p>Owner Yao smiled sweetly when she heard this. She nodded and was just about to speak when her face slightly changed.</p><p>A large hand was suddenly extended toward Xiao Yan while her face was changing. It rudely pressed against one of the three jade boxes. His loud voice resounded over the hall.</p><p>&#x201C;This Jade Bone Fruit&#x2026; I want it.&#x201D;</p>
