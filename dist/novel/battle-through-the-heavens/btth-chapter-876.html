<p><strong><u>Chapter 876: News of a Heavenly Flame</u></strong></p><p>&#x201C;Finding another &#x2018;Heavenly Flame?&#x2019;&#x201D;</p><p>Su Qian was immediately startled when he heard Xiao Yan&#x2019;s words within the Meeting Room. His face was stunned. He was naturally aware of the rarity of a &#x2018;Heavenly Flame.&#x2019; Had it not been by chance and the reliance on the strength of the headmaster, it would naturally would have been impossible for the Jia Nan Academy to find the &#x2018;Fallen Heart Flame&#x2019; and seal it within the Inner Academy.</p><p>Xiao Yan expression became increasing solemn as he studied Su Qian&#x2019;s stunned face. He said in a deep voice, &#x201C;That&#x2019;s right, perhaps First Elder should also be aware that the Qi Method that I practice is able to obtain some strength from the &#x2018;Heavenly Flame.&#x2019; Therefore, if I am able to obtain a kind of &#x2018;Heavenly Flame,&#x2019; I should be able to rely on the wonder of the &#x2018;Heavenly Flame&#x2019; to completely resolve this &#x2018;Demon Poison Spot.&#x2019;&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;&#x2018;Heavenly Flame&#x2026;&#x2019; it is easier said than done when it comes to obtaining this thing&#x2026; the attraction of the &#x2018;Heavenly Flame&#x2019; in the Dou Qi continent is even greater than the so-called Bodhisattva Body Transformation Saliva. Basically, if some rumors were to spread, it would invite a countless number of experts to look into it. Moreover, the &#x2018;Heavenly Flames&#x2019; that exist on the Dou Qi continent are so few that they are countable. Forget about obtaining one, even just searching for one would require an endless amount of time and effort.&#x201D;Su Qian smiled bitterly, and shook his head as he replied.</p><p>Xiao Yan also sighed. He softly said, &#x201C;However, I currently only possess this method. Therefore, regardless of how difficult it is, I must still go and look for it. The reason I have come to the Jia Nan Academy this time around is to inquire if you know any information regarding other &#x2018;Heavenly Flames.&#x2019; After all, First Elder&#x2019;s understanding of the Dou Qi continent is much greater than me.&#x201D;</p><p>Su Qian also helplessly shook his head as he watched Xiao Yan&#x2019;s anticipating gaze. He mused, &#x201C;Why don&#x2019;t you ask your teacher, Yao zun-zhe (Dou Zun), about this? With him being an alchemist grandmaster, his understanding of the &#x2018;Heavenly Flames&#x2019; is far from what I can compare with. I think that he should be aware of something.&#x201D;</p><p>Xiao Yan&#x2019;s eyes shrank slightly when he heard this. He softly said, &#x201C;Teacher has already fallen into the hands of the &#x2018;Hall of Souls.&#x2019; One of the reasons that I am so anxious to search for &#x2018;Heavenly Flame&#x2019; is because of the poison within my body. The other is that I wish to obtain strength from the &#x2018;Heavenly Flame&#x2019; and rescue teacher from the hands of the &#x2018;Hall of Souls.&#x2019;&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Yao zun-zhe (Dou Zun) has fallen into the hands of the &#x2018;Hall of Souls?&#x2019;&#x201D; Su Qian involuntarily cried out loud. His expression changed slightly when he heard Xiao Yan speak.</p><p>Xiao Yan nodded his head bitterly. The fist under his sleeve slowly tightened.</p><p>Su Qian also sighed softly as he looked at Xiao Yan&#x2019;s manner. He frowned and said, &#x201C;I wonder just why that mysterious faction needs so many powerful spiritual bodies. They are a group of stealthy fellows. Back then, the headmaster did have some conflict with them and had a big fight with an expert from the &#x2018;Hall of Souls&#x2019; who had become a Zun Elder. However, he did not manage to gain much of an upper hand.</p><p>&#x201C;Zun Elder?&#x201D; The corner of Xiao Yan&#x2019;s mouth lifted when he heard this term. He knew that the &#x2018;Hall of Souls&#x2019; had people who possessed this form of address and that there were some ultimate experts at the Dou Zun class. The current him did not have the slightest ability to resist an expert at that class now.</p><p>&#x201C;Currently, you can also be considered to have become enemies with this mysterious faction. You should be more careful in the future. Before you have absolute confidence, it is best that you do not easily head to find Yao zun-zhe. Otherwise, it is likely that you will just deliver yourself to be killed. This &#x2018;Hall of Souls&#x2019; has an extremely great strength. Even the headmaster was extremely fearful of this mysterious organization when he mentioned them to me back then.&#x201D; Su Qian reminded in a deep voice.</p><p>Xiao Yan nodded slightly. He was naturally aware of just how strong the &#x2018;Hall of Souls&#x2019; was. Just some protectors were already able to turn him into a miserable state. If the stronger so-called Zun Elder were to arrive, it was likely that Xiao Yan would have no other choice but to turn around and flee.</p><p>&#x201C;However, Yao zhu-zhe had many friends back then. Quite a number of powerful fellows on the Dou Qi continent that had some relationship with me. Although these people might not oppose the &#x2018;Hall of Souls&#x2019; because of you, they are still a hidden strength. Of course, if it is possible, it is best that you find someone. This person would be a great help to you when you attempt to rescue Yao zun-zhe.&#x201D; Su Qian crossed his fingers and slowly explained.</p><p>&#x201C;Who?&#x201D; Xiao Yan asked in a startled manner.</p><p>&#x201C;Feng zun-zhe.&#x201D; Su Qian spoke in a deep voice. His tone contained a little respect when he spoke these three words.</p><p>&#x201C;Feng Zun Zhe?&#x201D; Xiao Yan&#x2019;s heart leaped slightly after hearing this name again. This was not the only time that he had heard this name. He didn&#x2019;t know much about the owner of the name. However, there were two things that he was aware of. The first was that this person&#x2019;s relationship with teacher was extremely deep. The second was that this person was a genuine Dou Zun.</p><p>&#x201C;That&#x2019;s right. Feng zun-zhe&#x2026; He is your teacher, Yao zun-zhe&#x2019;s, close confidant. Back then, Yao zun-zhe had disappeared for no reason and Han Feng announced that he had burned to death while refining a pill. However, Feng zun-zhe adopted a doubtful attitude toward this kind of far-fetch reason. During these years, he has roamed all over the continent searching for information relating to Yao zun-zhe. It was because Han Feng was worried that Feng zun-zhe would discover something that he ended up hiding in the &#x2018;Black-Corner Region&#x2019; for so many years. During Feng zun-zhe&#x2019;s search all over the place, he fought quite a number of times with the &#x2018;Hall of Souls.&#x2019; However, I am not very clear about the exact reason&#x2026;&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;If you are able to find him, he would definitely treat you like his own disciple given your status as Yao zun-zhe&#x2019;s disciple. The treatment might even exceed this. Honestly speaking, a person who is not involved is really not certain why Yao zun-zhe and him have such a deep relationship. It is likely that even some blood related brothers are not at this level.&#x201D; Su Qian sighed before immediately saying with a smile, &#x201C;I have said all of this in order to tell you that if you are able to find Feng zun-zhe, he would definitely be a great help. Moreover, this help comes from someone whom you can completely trust.&#x201D;</p><p>Xiao Yan nodded slightly. He immediately bitterly smiled and said, &#x201C;The Dou Qi continent is so huge. It is easier said than done if one wishes to find an elite Dou Zun from nowhere.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;This will depend on your luck&#x2026; Feng zun-zhe is extremely strong. Even the headmaster praises him highly. It will be quite beneficial to you if you find him. You would not need to worry about the &#x2018;Hall of Soul&#x2019; seeking revenge in the future.&#x201D; Su Qian spread his hand. He did not have an exact method to allow Xiao Yan to swiftly find Feng zun-zhe. If he had released some information, it was likely that before Feng zun-zhe could hurry over, the omnipresent &#x2018;Hall of Souls&#x2019; and some of Yao zun-zhe&#x2019;s enemies would have arrived first&#x2026;</p><p>&#x201C;I will try my best&#x2026;&#x201D; Xiao Yan helplessly shook his head. His eyes looked to Su Qian as he said, &#x201C;However, I feel that I should inquire about a little more information related to the &#x2018;Heavenly Flames&#x2019; before this. Regardless of what kind of help I can find, I feel that raising my own strength is the most important thing.</p><p>&#x201C;First Elder, you have extraordinary experience and would more or less know some of the issues on the Dou Qi continent. If you have any clues related to a &#x2018;Heavenly Flame,&#x2019; please inform me regardless of how low the chances of success are. This is extremely important to me.&#x201D;</p><p>Although Xiao Yan had three &#x2018;Purifying Demonic Lotus Flame&#x2019; map fragments within his Storage Ring, he did not take them out to ask Su Qian about them. It was that he could not trust First Elder Su Qian, it was just that the allure of this Purifying Demonic Lotus Flame was really too frightening. Back then, when he had obtained the first map fragment Yao Lao had solemnly told him that he must definitely not allow anyone to know about this matter. Hence, Xiao Yan had kept this a secret even when he had obtained the map fragment from Hai Bodong&#x2019;s hands back then, Until now, he had tried to hide this matter in his heart and not allow anyone to know about it unless he was forced to reveal it.</p><p>Su Qian sighed softly as he looked at Xiao Yan&#x2019;s sincere face. His body leaned against the backrest of his chair. He narrowed his eyes slightly as his finger gently tapped on the table. This continued for awhile before he managed to pick out a memory from his mind that had been buried by time, &#x201C;I do indeed know something related to other &#x2018;Heavenly Flames.&#x2019;&#x201D;</p><p>Hearing this, the eyes that Xiao Yan used to look at Su Qian immediately became extremely heated.</p><p>&#x201C;I wonder if you have heard of a faction called the Burning Flame Valley?&#x201D; Su Qian raised his eyes and asked.</p><p>&#x201C;Burning Flame Valley?&#x201D; Xiao Yan immediately became momentarily startled when he heard this name. This faction&#x2019;s name was not something that he had heard for the first time. This was because the &#x2018;Sky Fire Three Mysterious Flames&#x2019; that he practiced was a Secret Technique, unique to this faction. Moreover, he also faintly recalled something. It seemed that Yao Lao had said back then that this faction on the Dou Qi continent was in control of a kind of unknown &#x2018;Heavenly Flame.&#x2019;</p><p>&#x201C;This faction has a kind of &#x2018;Heavenly Flame&#x2019; in its lineage since ancient times. This kind of &#x2018;Heavenly Flame&#x2019; is called the &#x2018;Nine Dragon Lightning Flame.&#x2019; It is ranked twelfth on the &#x2018;Heavenly Flame Ranking.&#x2019; If one were to discuss it, it is even higher than the &#x2018;Fallen Heart Flame&#x2019; in the ranking. However, I am not too certain about its exact use. Nevertheless, it is definitely not weaker than the &#x2018;Fallen Heart Flame&#x2019; by virtue of it possessing a higher ranking on the &#x2018;Heavenly Flame Ranking.&#x2019;&#x201D; Su Qian slowly explained.</p><p>Xiao Yan curled his lips slightly when he heard this. He remembered that Yao Lao mentioned that the Burning Flame Valley possessed a &#x2018;Heavenly Flame.&#x2019; However, he had been unaware of the exact details. Moreover, he also clearly understood that the strength of this Burning Flame Valley was extremely strong. Attempting to obtain the so-called Nine Dragon Lightning Flame from them would definitely not be an easy matter.</p><p>Su Qian laughed bitterly as he looked at Xiao Yan&#x2019;s changing face, &#x201C;This is the only information of a &#x2018;Heavenly Flame&#x2019; that I know about a little more in detail. If you have the ability, you can indeed target it. However, you must definitely be careful. The people from the Burning Flame Valley are all people with hot tempers. If you are caught, you would definitely form an enmity with them that would be difficult to resolve.&#x201D;</p><p>Xiao Yan nodded slightly. That Nine Dragon Lightning Flame could basically be considered the lifeblood of the Burning Flame Valley. If he were to snatch it away, they would definitely not rest until they died. However&#x2026; in order to rescue Yao Lao and his father&#x2026; there are somethings that he could not avoid even if they were unethical!</p><p>Xiao Yan inhaled a deep breath and a dense coldness suddenly rose within his dark-black eyes. However, before he was about to nod his head, a cool and indifferent voice suddenly sounded within the room.</p><p>&#x201C;Although the Nine Dragon Lightning Flame is a &#x2018;Heavenly Flame,&#x2019; an extremely special blood spiritual imprint had been placed on it after the repeated refinement by the Burning Flame Valley over a couple hundred years. Unless one is someone who practices the Burning Flame Valley&#x2019;s Qi Method, it is impossible for one to truly possess it as his own even if one were to obtain the Nine Dragon Lightning Flame.</p><p>Xiao Yan&#x2019;s and Su Qian&#x2019;s expressions changed slightly upon hearing this voice that had suddenly appeared. The Xiao Yan suddenly turned around and curled his hand which was facing the door. A wild suction force surged out. The door burst apart and a blue-clothed lady was forcefully sucked into the room amid an exclamation. Finally, her delicate neck was firmly held in Xiao Yan&#x2019;s hand.</p><p>Xiao Yan&#x2019;s gaze, which was filled with some killing intent, shot to the lady&#x2019;s face as his hand firmly grabbed the lady&#x2019;s snow-white neck. After which, he became stunned.</p><p>&#x201C;Why is it you?&#x201D;</p>
