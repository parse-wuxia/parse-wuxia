<p><strong><u>Chapter 1224: Situation</u></strong></p><p>Xiao Yan&#x2019;s body did not pause even a little despite hearing the furious roar that was transmitted over from a great distance. Purple-brown flame lingered over his body, causing him to appear like a fire beast on a rampage. Those remaining guards within the Hall of Soul hurriedly dodge when they saw this fiend charging out. Those Protectors that had been killed in Xiao Yan&#x2019;s hands earlier had caused them to be completely frightened. Who would dare to step forward and stop him now?</p><p>Without anyone stopping him, Xiao Yan&#x2019;s speed was also raised to its peak. He could sense that old ghost Zhai Xing was swiftly giving chase. Clearly, that old fellow had been truly infuriated after being fooled by his Three Thousand Lightning Illusionary Body.</p><p>&#x201C;This old bastard&#x2026;&#x201D;</p><p>Xiao Yan cursed quietly within his heart. If it was not because of this old ghost Zhai Xing, this trip would have progressed extremely smoothly. Unfortunately&#x2026; the peak of a fifth class Dou Zun&#x2019;s strength was sufficient to cause a reversal in the strength of the lineup from both parties this time around.</p><p>Xiao Yan cursed a little in his heart. After which, he raised his head and looked at the exit a short distance away. His feet suddenly stomped onto the ground and his body turned into a purple-brown light that shot out with a &#x2018;swoosh&#x2019; sound.</p><p>A couple of extremely fierce and violent force in the sky was violently smashed down as Xiao Yan rushed out of the Hall of Souls. This shocked Xiao Yan while he hurriedly dodge them. His body moved and he quickly rushed to the midair. Only then did he have the free time to watch the situation outside of the Hall of Soul.</p><p>Currently, the valley was a complete mess. Enormous crack lines like huge savage mouths covered the entire valley. Some of the crack lines even climbed up the mountain slope. Large rocks continuously rolled down from the surrounding cliffs, smashing the valley until it shook continuously, appearing as though an earthquake had occurred.</p><p>Human figures crossed each other in the midair of the valley. Vast and mighty Dou Qi permeated the sky. Ten powerful and frightening auras fluctuated in the sky. In the face of this unprecedented intense battle, the space of this place had become unusually unstable. Numerous crack lines surfaced like large pythons, causing those Hall of Souls Protectors to feel a palpitation within their hearts. They did not dare to intervene in a battle at this level.</p><p>Other than the five extremely intense battles in the sky, there was another battleground that had attracted Xiao Yan&#x2019;s attention. It was the spot where Zi Yan was located. No elite Dou Zun went to disturb this little girl. Hence, she could only go and find some Hall of Soul&#x2019;s Protectors to vent her anger. The strength of this little girl had undoubtedly soared greatly after being missing for a period of time. However, the strange thing was that Xiao Yan was actually unable to tell Zi Yan&#x2019;s actual strength with his Spiritual Perception. That manner was as though there was something that had completely hid this girl&#x2019;s strength.</p><p>Although Xiao Yan usually unable to sense it, from the way Zi Yan use a palm to strike a Protector that had reached the strength of a six star Dou Zong until he spat out blood and flew backwards, the strength of this girl should be quite strong.</p><p>Xiao Yan&#x2019;s eyes swiftly swept over the situation in this area. He let out a sigh. From this manner, it seemed that Xiao Yan&#x2019;s group had not fallen into a disadvantage. The five Dou Zuns on the Hall of Soul&#x2019;s side had the strength of three stars or so. Hence, other than Tie Jian zun-zhe, who was barely able to hang on, the remaining four all firmly took the upper hand.</p><p>&#x201C;The person has been rescued. Scatter!&#x201D;</p><p>In this situation, Xiao Yan no longer had the time to explain anything. He let out a loud cry after discerning the situation.</p><p>Upon hearing Xiao Yan&#x2019;s cry in the sky, a joy surged up the face of Feng zun-zhe and the others. However, their opponents had unleashed a wild attacks at this moment, firmly pestering them and causing them to be unable to escape.</p><p>Xiao Yan frowned tightly as he watched the extremely chaotic battlegrounds in the sky. This kind of situation was far more complicated than what he had expected.</p><p>&#x201C;Chi chi!&#x201D;</p><p>Xiao Yan had naturally attracted the attention of some Hall of Soul experts around when he appeared. They might not possess the qualification to participate in the fight above but they thought that it was possible to use their numbers to delay Xiao Yan. Hence, three figures rushed over. The black chains in their hands were like straight sharp spears which pierced explosively towards Xiao Yan&#x2019;s head.</p><p>&#x201C;Get lost!&#x201D;</p><p>Xiao Yan&#x2019;s expression turn cold as he sensed the attacks of these three Hall of Soul&#x2019;s Protectors. His hand was suddenly extended and he directly grabbed the three chains. His hand shook and purple-brown fire dragons roared from his sleeves. After which, they rushed through the chain and heavily struck onto the chest of the three Hall of Soul&#x2019;s Protectors.</p><p>The bodies of the three Protectors immediately flew backwards after suffering such heavy blow. Finally, they violently collided onto a stone pillar by the side. The black fog that lingered over their bodies became much thinner in an instant.</p><p>Those experts from the Hall of Souls around Xiao Yan also had faces filled with shock when they saw the latter randomly defeating the three Protectors. Their forward charging bodies hurriedly halted and they no longer dared to easily charge forward.</p><p>&#x201C;Since you have come, you can forget about leaving!&#x201D;</p><p>Xiao Yan had just stepped back after forcing away the three Protectors when the roof of the enormous hall suddenly burst apart. A figure rose to the sky as a dense cold laughter resounded over the place.</p><p>&#x201C;This is bad. That old ghost has come chasing!&#x201D;</p><p>Xiao Yan&#x2019;s expression immediately changed upon hearing this cold laughter.</p><p>&#x201C;Spatial Barrier. Seal!&#x201D;</p><p>Old ghost Zhai Xing swept his dark dense eyes over those battlegrounds from the sky. After which, they paused on Xiao Yan&#x2019;s body. The denseness of his face became even riches. Both of his hands swiftly formed some strange seals as he cried out in a deep voice.</p><p>After old ghost Zhai Xing&#x2019;s cry sounded, the space of the valley suddenly began to fluctuate intensely. After which, circular folds spread. They became like clothes stacked onto each other as they were suspended in the empty sky.</p><p>&#x201C;Old ghost Zhai Xing?&#x201D;</p><p>Feng zun-zhe, who was being entangled with his opponent, also discovered old ghost Zhai Xing. His face changed drastically as he involuntarily cried out.</p><p>&#x201C;Feng Xian, you really won&#x2019;t give up. This time around, you have even barge into my Hall of Soul!&#x201D; Old ghost Zhai Xing&#x2019;s eyes were sinister as he glanced at Feng zun-zhe and said.</p><p>Feng zun-zhe&#x2019;s expression was gloomy. His palm violently struck onto the Honorable Elder of the Hall of Soul in front of him, who had reached the strength of a three star Dou Zun, and forced the latter to take a step back. The current situation had somewhat exceeded their control. The appearance of this old ghost Zhai Xing could have considered to have turn the situation of this place around. If something went wrong, it was likely that quite a lot of deaths would occur in this group of theirs today.</p><p>&#x201C;Once the old me has finished off this little fellow, I will let all of you know that my Hall of Soul is not a place where you can come and go as you please!&#x201D; Old ghost Zhai Xing laughed coldly. Immediately, his dark and dense eyes were turned towards Xiao Yan below. His voice was dense as he spoke, &#x201C;You dare to fool the old me with just the strength of a Dou Zong. This is the first time that the old me has met with such a thing!&#x201D;</p><p>Old ghost Zhai Xing stepped gently onto the empty air after his words sounded and walked towards Xiao Yan. Black fog surged out from within his body in all directions. That might caused one to feel shock. The strength of a five star Dou Zun was indeed unusually frightening.</p><p>Xiao Yan&#x2019;s expression also changed slightly as he looked at old ghost Zhai Xing, who was stepping over the black fog that permeated the sky and arrive with great killing intent. This old fellow was obviously planning to personally kill him. However, with Xiao Yan&#x2019;s current strength, it was impossible for him to truly be a match for old ghost Zhai Xing even if he used the Skyfire Three Mysterious Change&#x2026;</p><p>Of course, this did not mean that Xiao Yan was completely just a pile of meat on a chopping board waiting to be slaughtered. The current him had already completely subdue the Three Thousand Burning Flame. He could be considered to be in possession of four types of Heavenly Flame. If he used four types of Heavenly Flames to merge into an Angry Buddha Lotus Flame, that might would definitely be far from what the Annihilation Lotus Flame that was created from the Life Transforming Flame could compare with&#x2026;</p><p>However, Xiao Yan required sufficient time to use this thing. With the strength of old ghost Zhai Xing, he would definitely not provide Xiao Yan with sufficient time to prepare that kind of great killing weapon.</p><p>Currently, the elite Dou Zuns on their side had already been held back by the Honorable Elders from the Hall of Souls. The only one who was still free to act was Zi Yan. This girl&#x2019;s strength might have currently soared and that her actual form was an Ancient Void Dragon but she was still young. It was impossible for her to be a match for old ghost Zhai Xing.</p><p>&#x201C;Let me help you hold him back.&#x201D;</p><p>While Xiao Yan&#x2019;s eyes were flickering, Zi Yan, who was a short distance away, appeared to have sensed his thoughts. Her delicate small body leaped over the midair and appeared in front of Xiao Yan. Her small face was filled with seriousness as she spoke.</p><p>&#x201C;Can you do it?&#x201D; Xiao Yan hesitated for a moment before asking in a worried manner.</p><p>&#x201C;Can you still find someone else now?&#x201D; Zi Yan replied without even turning her head.</p><p>Xiao Yan was speechless. He could only clench his teeth and speak in a deep voice, &#x201C;Help me buy some time. Be careful. Pull back if you are really unable to do it!&#x201D;</p><p>Zi Yan nodded her small head slightly. Her little hands suddenly formed a couple of strange seals. Immediately, an intense purple light surged out from within her body. Under this purple light, Zi Yan&#x2019;s lovely little body suddenly grew rapidly. Within a short couple of breaths, she had turned from a little girl into a tall purple-haired great beauty who appeared extremely sexy. That alluring manner was actually the same as the one that Xiao Yan had seen in the small valley back then.</p><p>Zi Yan pulled a tread of purple hair behind her ear after transforming into this appearance. She turned her head, only to see Xiao Yan&#x2019;s stunned manner. Her pretty face reddened and she immediately glared viciously at him. However, she had forgotten that she was no longer that little girl from earlier. By performing such an expression, she had instead appear extremely bewitching, causing one&#x2019;s heart to pound.</p><p>&#x201C;You have really undergone a big change&#x2026;&#x201D;</p><p>Xiao Yan laughed bitterly and shook his head. He immediately inhaled a deep breath of air and swiftly pulled back. His voice was deep as he said, &#x201C;I&#x2019;ll leave him to you. Be careful!&#x201D;</p><p>Xiao Yan pulled his hands back while he withdrew. The purple-brown flame appeared. After which, they separated, turning into three clusters of different coloured Heavenly Flames that suspended in front of him&#x2026;</p><p>While Xiao Yan had moved his hand and prepared a great killing weapon, Zi Yan&#x2019;s pretty eyes had also become unusually grave. She firmly stared at old ghost Zhai Xing a short distance away. It was possible for her to sense a truly dangerous aura on the latter&#x2019;s body. This time around, it was no longer just a game.</p><p>In this current situation, Zi Yan was also clearly aware that this old ghost Zhai Xing was the greatest variable. Little Fairy Doctor and the rest were current unable to free themselves. If he was allowed to charge into those battlegrounds, Little Fairy Doctor and the rest would definitely be swiftly defeated. At that time, everything would truly be over.</p><p>Therefore, no matter what happened, she must hold this old fellow back. She needed to delay him until Xiao Yan successfully unleash that great killing weapon. Only then would they be able to safely withdraw from this rescue operation today. Otherwise&#x2026; their group would truly suffer heavy casualties.</p><p>All the hope was on whether she could buy sufficient time for Xiao Yan!</p>
