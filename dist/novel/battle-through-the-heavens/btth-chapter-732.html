<p><strong><u>Chapter 732: Parting Ways</u></strong></p><p>Nalan Yaran flew in a certain direction out of the city once she left the Xiao clan. Xiao Yan knit his brows slightly and followed close behind.</p><p>Her speed was not reduced even after flying out of the capital. Instead, she flew in the direction of the Misty Cloud Mountain. Xiao Yan pondered for a moment when he saw this before continuing to follow. With his current strength, he need not be worried that Nalan Yanran might play a trick. Although the latter was also at the peak of the Dou Wang class, Xiao Yan had the confidence to kill her within ten exchanges if they were to really fight.</p><p>They flew above the enormous plains as though they were chasing after the stars and moon until the Misty Cloud Mountain, that penetrated the sky, appeared in his sight. Xiao Yan&#x2019;s speed was increased. A moment later, he followed close behind Nalan Yanran and appeared on the Misty Cloud Mountain.</p><p>Xiao Yan&#x2019;s figure was standing in the air. His gaze swept over the empty sect below. At this moment, there was not even a little of the liveliness of the past in the current Misty Cloud Sect. Not even half a human figure could be seen as the autumn wind blew past. The open ground was messy and especially desolate-looking.</p><p>During the time that Xiao Yan&#x2019;s gaze swept past this scene, Nalan Yanran&#x2019;s gaze was looking below with a startled look. A moment later, she sighed and immediately could not resist looking at Xiao Yan with a furious look. She spoke in a deep voice, &#x201C;Are you only satisfied after turning things into this manner?&#x201D;</p><p>Xiao Yan&#x2019;s gaze was cold as he glanced at the somewhat angry Nalan Yanran. His voice was calm as he said, &#x201C;Would you still say this if you saw how my Xiao clan was killed by the Misty Cloud Sect until nothing was left?&#x201D;</p><p>Nalan Yanran paused and didn&#x2019;t say anything. She heard from Yun Yun about how bloody and savage the Misty Cloud Sect was. However, when she saw that the once busy sect became desolate, her heart didn&#x2019;t feel too great.</p><p>Nalan Yanran&#x2019;s pupils paused on Xiao Yan&#x2019;s young, delicate, peaceful face. A slight ripple appeared in her eyes. He seemed to have become much more matured and colder compared to three years ago. It is likely that he had experienced quite a lot during these three years.</p><p>Nalan Yanran&#x2019;s mind was somewhat absent-minded as she looked at the black-robed, young man in front of her. She suddenly recalled the matter that changed the relationship between the two of them a couple of years ago.</p><p>That day, she relied on the might of the Misty Cloud Sect to ruthlessly trample on his little remaining pride because his Dou Qi had dissipated.</p><p>She was still clearly able to remember her fury and the vicious, cold, naive words she said back then. However, those naive words from back then had currently been completely realized.</p><p>A bitterness seemed out from the corner of Nalan Yanran&#x2019;s mouth as she thought until this point. She mocked herself, &#x201C;Actually, I currently feel quite regretful about that matter back then. If I did not head to the Xiao clan in my willfulness, it is likely that the Xiao clan and the Misty Cloud Sect would all be fine.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Unfortunately, there is no medicine for regret in this world.&#x201D; Xiao Yan inhaled a deep breath of air. He immediately waved his hand with some agitation and said, &#x201C;Bring me to see Yun Yun. Those matters have already been dealt with. There is no way to change it no matter what happens. Hence, there is no need to mention them.&#x201D;</p><p>The bitterness on the corner of Nalan Yanran&#x2019;s mouth became even more intense upon seeing this manner of Xiao Yan. The back of her teeth gently bit her lower red lip. This could be considered a bitter fruit that she had planted. A bitterness had indeed seeped deep into her heart now that she had eaten it.</p><p>&#x201C;I am not thinking of getting you to forget about those matters back then. It is just that I want to say that I, Nalan Yanran, did indeed have the short-sightedness of a mouse. Given the current situation, I can be considered to have sought my own bitterness.&#x201D; Nalan Yanran mocked herself before immediately turning around and swiftly flying to the backside of the mountain. &#x201C;Follow me.&#x201D;</p><p>A glow flickered in Xiao Yan&#x2019;s eyes as he looked at the graceful figure in front of him. A moment later, he flapped the fire wings on his back and swiftly followed.</p><p>Xiao Yan followed Nalan Yanran to the back of the mountain and passed through some dense forest along the way. Finally, they stopped at a precipitous mountain cliff.</p><p>&#x201C;Teacher is on the top of the cliff. You can go by yourself. After today, teacher and I will leave the Jia Ma Empire. We might seldom return in the future.&#x201D; Nalan Yanran pointed to the top of the cliff and spoke in a soft voice as her body paused in front of the cliff.</p><p>&#x201C;Leave?&#x201D; Xiao Yan was startled when he heard this. He immediately asked in a deep voice, &#x201C;Where?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;We still don&#x2019;t know. The Dou Qi continent is so huge and I have long thought of going out to experience it. This time around, I will accompany teacher and leave. We might well not have gain another chance to meet in the future.&#x201D; Nalan Yanran let out a somewhat melancholy sigh. She immediately turned around and walked down the cliff.</p><p>Xiao Yan&#x2019;s face was slightly solemn as he watched Nalan Yanran&#x2019;s back. He clenched his teeth and swiftly rushed to the mountain cliff. A moment later, he appeared on the cliff. His eyes looked at the edge of the precipitous mountain cliff. There was a white-clothed woman standing elegantly at that spot. She had smooth black hair that fell down along her shoulder. It drifted just as the breeze blew, appearing refined and quiet.</p><p>&#x201C;You have arrived.&#x201D;</p><p>The lady spoke in a soft voice. She suddenly let out a distant sigh after having heard that slight footsteps.</p><p>&#x201C;You are intending to leave the Jia Ma Empire?&#x201D; Xiao Yan&#x2019;s expression was somewhat ugly as he slowly walked forward and questioned in a deep voice.</p><p>The lady slowly turned around and revealed that pretty face. She was naturally Yun Yun. At this moment, her pretty eyes glanced at Xiao Yan as she said, &#x201C;The Misty Cloud Sect has already ceased to exist. There is no longer any point in me remaining. I have been trapped within this Jia Ma Empire for so many years and it is good to be able to leave.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;There are many experts on the Dou Qi continent with a danger that is beyond compare. As a lady, going out to experience it is no different for asking to suffer. This Jia Ma Empire may not be as interesting as the outside world but it can protect you.&#x201D; Xiao Yan clenched his teeth and spoke. He studied Yun Yun. She was wearing a dispirited look between her eyebrows.</p><p>Yun Yun immediately revealed a smile upon hearing Xiao Yan&#x2019;s words. Although her smile was short-lived, it caused one to be dazzled.</p><p>&#x201C;No matter how one puts it, I have the strength of someone at the peak of the Dou Huang class. How can I be some weak woman without even the strength to restrain a chicken.&#x201D; Yun Yun shook her head slightly. Her bright eyes looked at Xiao Yan as she softly said, &#x201C;You have already turned the Misty Cloud Sect into this manner. I know that you are doing this for revenge after the Misty Cloud Sect attempted to exterminate your Xiao clan. The disbanding of the Misty Cloud Sect now can be considered retribution. I do not hate you even though teacher has died in your hands.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Then why are you still leaving?&#x201D; Xiao Yan knit his brows. He hesitated a little before speaking, &#x201C;I am currently lacking some powerful experts beside me. If you really do not hate me, you can stay behind and help me.&#x201D;</p><p>The glow in her bright pupils started intently at Xiao Yan. It only turned away after the latter&#x2019;s face turned slightly red. Yun Yun&#x2019;s voice was gentle as she spoke, &#x201C;Indeed, I do not hate you. However, I am ultimately the Sect Leader of the Misty Cloud Sect&#x2026; even though the Misty Cloud Sect is already non-existent.&#x201D;</p><p>Xiao Yan clenched his fist tight. A fury surfaced within his eyes. He understood Yun Yun&#x2019;s meaning. She did indeed not hate him for destroying the Misty Cloud Sect. However, due to her unique status, she could not remain by his side.</p><p>&#x201C;Given my status and position, I should be doing my best to take revenge. However, you should know that even if I have that ability, I do not have the heart to act&#x2026; since this is the case, it is best to leave.&#x201D; Yun Yun&#x2019;s voice was despondent as she responded.</p><p>Xiao Yan&#x2019;s expression was dark. This woman was always so stubborn!</p><p>&#x201C;I heard that you are intending to establish a faction within the Jia Ma Empire. What the Misty Cloud Sect has collected over the many years is in here. It no longer has much use to me now. I shall give it to you.&#x201D; Yun Yun smiled as she looked at Xiao Yan&#x2019;s expression. She slowly stepped forward, carrying a fragrant wind. She immediately placed that dark-green ring in Xiao Yan&#x2019;s hand.</p><p>Xiao Yan held the storage ring tightly. His gaze stared intently at this woman who had left him a deep memory during the first time that he had left to train. He asked in a deep voice, &#x201C;Must you leave?&#x201D;</p><p>Yun Yun looked at the delicate, handsome, young face from close proximity. A gentleness surfaced within her eyes. There was a little less tenderness and more maturity within it compared to three years ago.</p><p>&#x201C;Little fellow, you really have grown up. Ke ke, now that the Misty Cloud Sect has turned into this manner, I also wish to go out and take a walk around. Perhaps I will return once again when I manage to settle the matter in my heart. At that time, it is likely that I will not reject you if you still wish for me to stay and help you.&#x201D; Yun Yun slowly extended her delicate hand and gently fondled Xiao Yan&#x2019;s face while she spoke in a gentle voice.</p><p>Xiao Yan&#x2019;s face also gradually turned gentler as he sensed the soft touch that was transmitted from her hand. It was not like he did not have the slightest feeling toward this woman in front of him.</p><p>&#x201C;Sometimes, I think that if you were a little bolder in the mountain cave back then and ignored my threats, now might&#x2026;&#x201D; Yun Yun suddenly laughed softly as her eyes stared at Xiao Yan.</p><p>Xiao Yan suddenly extended his hand as his eyes flickered. He hugged that delicate waist and whispered, &#x201C;Are you implying something?&#x201D;</p><p>A faint bright-redness surfaced on Yun Yun&#x2019;s pale snow-like face upon being forcefully hugged by Xiao Yan. She gently struggled for a moment but she was hugged even more tightly by Xiao Yan.</p><p>Yun Yun could only give up her struggle after a futile attempt to break away. She flipped her hand and a deep-blue inner vest appeared in her hand. She gently pressed the vest against Xiao Yan&#x2019;s chest and softly spoke, &#x201C;This is the first thing that I gave you. Originally, it was tattered but I have carefully mended it. Even though it no longer has much use to you now, you can still carefully hold on to it. Otherwise, don&#x2019;t blame me for falling out with you should you be unable to take it out when I return to the Jia Ma Empire in the future.&#x201D;</p><p>Xiao Yan was startled as he looked at the vest pressed against his chest. The events surrounding her in the past also began to flash one at a time in Xiao Yan&#x2019;s head in a torrent-like manner. His gaze was slightly lowered as he looked at the gentle-feeling that was contained in her pretty moving eyes. An impulse surged within his heart. He forcefully held the latter&#x2019;s skinny snow-white chin. After which, his mouth was imprinted on her tender, beautiful dripping-red lips.</p><p>Yun Yun only had the time to emit a soft hoot upon being sneakily attacked by Xiao Yan before she was stopped. Her delicate hand knocked against the front of his chest but it was soft and weak. There was not even the slightest force within it.</p><p>&#x201C;Forget it. In any case, I am about to leave. I shall just do as you want for once&#x2026;&#x201D; Yun Yun softly sighed in her heart as she shut her eyes. Her tightly closed mouth was slowly opened and allowed the other party&#x2019;s domineering attack in.</p><p>A man and woman were in a tight embrace on the cliff of a mountain. They were emitting a feeling that would cause one&#x2019;s heart to feel a fiery heat.</p><p>Nalan Yanran&#x2019;s delicate hand gently leaned against the rock wall on one side of the mountain cliff. Her gaze was complicated as she looked at the man and woman who were hugging in the distance. A moment later, she let out a smile of melancholy as she quietly withdrew.</p>
