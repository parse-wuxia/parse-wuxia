<p><strong><u>Chapter 194: The Mysterious Creature In The Magma</u></strong></p><p>Fiery red magma was slowly flowing within the enormous crypt. Occasionally, there would be huge bubbles of air floating out from within it. A moment later, there would be a soft &#x2018;bang&#x2019; as the bubbles burst apart. The hot magma would shoot out from within, appearing as beautiful as a fiery, red firework.</p><p>Standing at the end of the small tunnel, Xiao Yan, Xiao Ding, and Qing Lan stared at the never ending magma world. Other than being shocked, they all involuntarily swallowed their saliva.</p><p>&#x201C;I didn&#x2019;t expect&#x2026; that hidden under Rock Desert City, there would be such a terrifying place.&#x201D; With a layer of dark green colored light on his body, Xiao Ding wiped the perspiration from his face and sighed with shock.</p><p>&#x201C;Yes, what a majestic underground magma world&#x2026;&#x201D; Xiao Yan&#x2019;s body was similarly covered by a layer of a Dou Qi cloak. Despite this, the surrounding temperature also caused his entire body to feel hot.</p><p>&#x201C;Where do we go now? There isn&#x2019;t any path left. Moreover, I trained using a wood type Qi Method, which is subdued by the fire type energy. If I did not possess the strength of a five star Dou Shi, I think that I wouldn&#x2019;t have been able to reach here. However&#x2026; this is my limit.&#x201D; Xiao Ding smiled bitterly at Xiao Yan.</p><p>Xiao Yan nodded his head. If his affinity was not of the fire element, he would not have been able to endure being grilled by the high temperature and would have given up. Moreover, ever since they had arrived at the dead end, Xiao Yan clearly realized that the fire type energy here was hotter and wilder than how it was in the tunnel.</p><p>&#x201C;Hu&#x2026;&#x201D; Exhaling gently, Xiao Yan lowered his head and watched Qing Lin who had been following behind him. He could not help but become stunned. Compared to the perspiration filled faces of Xiao Yan and Xiao Ding, Qing Lin appeared much more relaxed. It should be known that Qing Lin did not possess much strength and was quite weak.</p><p>After calming his heart, Xiao Yan, who was staring intently at Qing Lin, could feel that the latter&#x2019;s body was emitting a never ending amount of chilling energy. It was largely due to this energy that Qing Lin could continue following them until the end of the tunnel.</p><p>&#x201C;This girl really does have some strange points. Was this due to the Snake-People bloodline in her? But even if a true Snake-Person were to arrive at such a place, they would also wail and choose to withdraw.&#x201D; Xiao Yan knitted his eyebrows together, feeling some suspicion in his heart.</p><p>&#x201C;What do you want to do now?&#x201D; Xiao Ding stared at the rolling magma world before tilting his head and asking.</p><p>&#x201C;I want to go in and take a look&#x2026;&#x201D; Xiao Yan mused for awhile before whispering.</p><p>&#x201C;Go in? Entering that magma? There isn&#x2019;t any path left. Don&#x2019;t tell me you want to swim over?&#x201D; Hearing the words, Xiao Ding&#x2019;s expression changed as he reproved slightly.</p><p>&#x201C;Haha. Naturally it is not possible to swim over. With the temperature here, even steel would melt, much less me,&#x201D; Xiao Yan smiled and shook his head. He removed the Heavy Xuan Ruler from his back and stored it in the storage ring. His body trembled slightly and the Purple Cloud Wings shot out from his back.</p><p>&#x201C;This is? &#x2026;&#x201D; Eyeing the pair of wings that had suddenly popped out of Xiao Yan&#x2019;s back, Xiao Ding&#x2019;s eyes narrowed. An instant later, he exclaimed in shock, &#x201C;Dou Qi transformation wings? Dou Wang? How is this possible?&#x201D;</p><p>Even though Xiao Ding was extremely confident about Xiao Yan&#x2019;s training talent, he would never believe that Xiao Yan would be able to become a Dou Wang before he was even twenty. It should be known that the total number of Dou Wangs in the Jia Ma Empire would not exceed twenty. Those were also well known strong people that had many stories; he had never heard of anyone who had achieved such an achievement before they were twenty.</p><p>Seeing Xiao Ding&#x2019;s shocked expression, Xiao Yan smiled and shook his head. His palm gently touched the Purple Cloud Wings as he said with a smile &#x201C;This is not a Dou Qi transformation wing. It is but a very rare flying type Dou Techniques. The flying speed is far inferior to a true pair of wings agglomerated from Dou Qi. However&#x2026; it can at least fly.&#x201D;</p><p>Hearing Xiao Yan&#x2019;s explanation, Xiao Ding heaved a sigh of relief. Staring at Xiao Yan with a somewhat strange gaze, he said, &#x201C;You little boy. Just how many secrets are you hiding?&#x201D;</p><p>Xiao Yan smiled, shook his head and changed the topic. &#x201C;Later, I will independently go in and take a look. Big Brother, you should bring Qing Lin along and take the same path back.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Wait. Even if you have the help of this pair of wings, the temperature in this crypt is also extremely terrifying. With your strength, how can you withstand it for a very long time?&#x201D; Xiao Ding cautiously said as he extended his hand to halt Xiao Yan.</p><p>&#x201C;Haha. Believe me. Nothing will happen.&#x201D; Xiao Yan laughed softly and said.</p><p>Xiao Ding frowned and stared intently at Xiao Yan. A long while later, he helplessly nodded and said, &#x201C;Be careful. If there are any changes, hurry out.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Yes.&#x201D; Xiao Yan smiled and nodded. He was just about to turn his body around and take action when an icy cold small hand suddenly pulled at him.</p><p>&#x201C;Young Master, wait&#x2026; there seems to be something in the magma!&#x201D;</p><p>Qing Lin hurriedly said as she grabbed Xiao Yan tightly. Her dark green eyes stared at the never ending fiery red magma.</p><p>&#x201C;What?&#x201D; Hearing this, Xiao Yan and Xiao Ding beside him were startled. They immediately swept their eyes hurriedly over the magma but did not discover anything other than a few huge rocks.</p><p>&#x201C;Qing Lin, what did you sense?&#x201D; In such a dangerous place, Xiao Yan did not dare to be careless even though he had Yao Lao to protect him. He immediately inquired seriously.</p><p>&#x201C;Within the magma, there seems to be something existing. I can sense its small veiled Qi&#x2026; it is very strong&#x2026;&#x201D; Qing Lin&#x2019;s gaze was totally focused as she stared deep into the repeatedly rolling magma. A glow surfaced in her deep green eyes. It was as though she had passed through the obstruction of the magma and was seeing the mysterious thing hidden under it.</p><p>&#x201C;There&#x2019;s a living creature?&#x201D; Xiao Yan&#x2019;s face was shocked. There was actually a living creature under this magma which was so hot that it could melt steel? This was something that Xiao Yan had difficulty believing.</p><p>&#x201C;Yes.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Is this the Qi that you sensed half a year ago?&#x201D; Xiao Ding asked in a deep voice while frowning as he watched the rolling bubbles in the flowing magma.</p><p>&#x201C;No&#x2026; that Qi was even stronger than this one.&#x201D; Qing Lin shook her head and said.</p><p>&#x201C;Its strength is slightly greater than Luo Bu from the Sand Mercenary Company.&#x201D; Qing Lin gestured with her small hand as she softly said. She had lived her entire life within the Rock Desert City. The strongest person she had seen was Luo Bu at the Da Dou Shi level. Thus, she could only use him as a reference of comparison.</p><p>&#x201C;Slightly stronger than Luo Bu&#x2026;&#x201D; Xiao Yan mumbled. His voice was a little heavier on the word &#x2018;slightly&#x2019;. From this kind of comparison by Qing Lin, Xiao Yan could roughly guess the strength of the thing that was hiding in the magma. Back then, that mysterious Qi was at least above that of a Dou Wang. Thus, Qing Lin described Luo Bu as being much, much weaker than it. According to this reasoning, the living creature in the magma should have the strength of a Dou Ling or more&#x2026;</p><p>Of course, this was Xiao Yan&#x2019;s guess. Whether he was right or not, even he was not too certain. If there really was a living creature that could live within the magma, then it&#x2019;s strength in this environment would be on par with a Dou Wang!</p><p>&#x201C;Hu&#x2026;&#x201D; Xiao Yan narrowed his eyes and exhaled his breath. He mused for a moment before he shook his head helplessly. With a grave voice, he said, &#x201C;Regardless of whether there is something hiding underneath, I must go in and take a look. The thing I need should be in this magma.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Big Brother, leave with Qing Lin. I will give it a try!&#x201D; Turning his head around, Xiao Yan gave his request to Xiao Ding. Without waiting for a response, his body leaped off the cliff toward the magma below. The pair of wings flapped and his body gradually floated over ten meters above the magma.</p><p>Seeing Xiao Yan flying in midair, Xiao Ding could only helplessly nod his head. However, he remained worried and did not immediately leave. Instead, he pulled Qing Lin back into the tunnel while his gaze stared intently at Xiao Yan&#x2019;s body flying above the magma.</p><p>Xiao Yan slowly flew above the magma. The Purple Flame Dou Qi encased the entire surface of his body within it. His Spiritual Perception also passed through his body and spread out as Xiao Yan cautiously scanned his surroundings. It appeared that the hidden living creature that Qing Lin had mentioned gave Xiao Yan quite a bit of pressure. In this kind of harsh environment, he really had to focus his attention to handle the different kinds of dangers that could suddenly occur.</p><p>Within the crypt, the temperature was extremely terrifying. Xiao Yan&#x2019;s body was of the fire affinity and he had support from the Purple Flame Dou Qi, but the faint fog that was emitted from the bubbles in the magma were both hot and accompanied by a type of fire poison. Thus, even though Xiao Yan had taken an antidote earlier, he still did not dare to carelessly breath in the surrounding air. Only when he reached his limit did he carefully let some air in to breath.</p><p>Xiao Yan may have only breathed in a small amount of air each time but the poison air that entered his body still caused his mind to feel giddy. If he had not taken an antidote earlier, he might not have been able to endure it and would have fallen into the hot magma.</p><p>Due to the many obstacles present, Xiao Yan did not dare fly very quickly. He hovered above the magma and slowly swept his gaze across it. Naturally, he did not dare make even the slightest noise as he flew, fearing that he may end up attracting an attack from the mysterious living creature in the magma.</p><p>As he flew through the air, Xiao Yan increasingly felt that the crypt was huge. The surrounding flow of magma had already aggregated here to form an enormous magma lake. Occasionally, with a hot wave of air surging upwards, a fiery red magma pillar would suddenly shoot up. Each time this happened, it would frighten Xiao Yan greatly who was flying above.</p><p>The lava world in the crypt was a world of death. Xiao Yan flew above the magma lake. Each time he flew for a short distance, he would feel his heart quiver. If his Dou Qi suddenly became exhausted here&#x2026; he might not even have a corpse remaining to tell the tale.</p><p>As Xiao Yan flew above the magma, his skin glowed faintly red. The clothes on his body also became particularly dry. If there were a spark now, his clothes would immediately combust.</p><p>After flying forward for some distance, Xiao Yan turned his head back slightly. He realized that the already small exit had already become even smaller. At the exit of the crypt, two tiny figures were staring intently at him.</p><p>Seeing the two figures, Xiao Yan helplessly shook his head. He was about to wave his hand to show that he was fine when Qing Lin&#x2019;s sharp voice suddenly screamed, &#x201C;Young Master! It is following you! Hurry back here!&#x201D; Hearing the sharp scream, Xiao Yan felt his head prickle. His body did not hesitate and changed directions in an instant. Flapping his pair of wings, he flew with all his might toward the tunnel exit.</p><p>Just as Xiao Yan&#x2019;s body moved, the calm magma lake under him suddenly let out a muffled sound. Numerous beams of hot magma violently shot out in an instant.</p><p>As the magma was flying in all directions, a mysterious living creature with a huge body suddenly burst fiercely out from the magma. In a lightning like manner, it turned its body toward the fleeing Xiao Yan and bit at him.</p>
