<p><strong><u>Chapter 1153: Xuan Kong Zi</u></strong></p><p>When Xiao Yan walked out of his room the next day, he coincidentally found Ye Zhong standing in the courtyard. Ye Zhong sighed in relief after seeing Xiao Yan exit the room. Immediately, he revealed how ashamed he was. Given the matter that had happened yesterday, he failed to provide proper protection.</p><p>&#x201C;Mister Xiao Yan, I have already dispatched people. They have worked through the night and obtained information about the location of the Profound Xuan Sect members&#x2026;&#x201D;</p><p>Xiao Yan was startled when he heard this. He looked at Ye Zhong&#x2019;s somewhat tired face. Clearly, he had worked through the night because of what happened last night. Immediately, Xiao Yan smiled, patted Ye Zhong&#x2019;s shoulder, and said, &#x201C;What happened last night is not your fault. Even the Little Fairy Doctor and old mister Yao failed to detect the threat&#x2026;&#x201D;</p><p>Ye Zhong bitterly smiled and nodded. He said, &#x201C;The members of the Profound Xuan Sect are in a manor on the southern side of the Holy Pill City&#x2019;s outer city. They are indeed the group in conflict with us at the alchemist trade fair. That white-clothed, young man is the son of the Profound Xuan Sect&#x2019;s leader, Chen Xian&#x2026; he is also an alchemist. It is rumored that he intends to participate in the Pill Gathering during this trip of his to Holy Pill City. The gray-clothed, old man by his side is the renowned Xuan zun-zhe of the Profound Xuan Sect. He is extremely strong. Additionally, there are two other Elders, whose strengths have reached the peak of the Dou Zong class, accompanying him&#x2026;&#x201D;</p><p>A fierce glint flashed across Xiao Yan&#x2019;s eyes as he nodded. Originally, he had not wished to form an enmity with the Profound Xuan Sect. However, the other party had come and provoked him. They should not blame him for being vicious.</p><p>&#x201C;Mister Xiao Yan, do you intend to attack them?&#x201D; Ye Zhong hesitated for a moment after seeing the way Xiao Yan acted before inquiring.</p><p>&#x201C;Once is enough given what happened yesterday&#x2026;&#x201D; Xiao Yan softly replied.</p><p>Ye Zhong licked his lips. He mused for a moment before saying, &#x201C;I think that now is not the best opportunity to attack them&#x2026; this place is, after all, Holy Pill City. That Chen Xian is also an alchemist recognized by the Pill Tower. Attacking them would inevitably attract the attention of the Pill Tower. Moreover, there are many experts beside Chen Xian. You will need to act stealthily when you attack or you will need to kill every single person accompanying him&#x2026; otherwise if word of this leaks, it will definitely stir the anger of the Profound Xuan Sect. At that time, you might face a lot of trouble. After all, behind the Profound Xuan Sect, there is still the great Profound Sky Sect&#x2026;&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Is Elder Ye Zhong&#x2019;s intention to treat what happened last night as though nothing has occurred?&#x201D; Xiao Yan frowned and asked.</p><p>&#x201C;Of course not&#x2026;&#x201D; Ye Zhong hurriedly shook his head. He said, &#x201C;It is just that you should be aware of how difficult it is to kill an elite Dou Zun. Once Xuan zun-zhe escapes, turbulent times will follow&#x2026; the one who is in charge of this group of people from the Profound Xuan Sect is likely Chen Xian. I think that selling information about us to the black-robed person from last night was his idea&#x2026;</p><p>&#x201C;The Pill Gathering will be held soon. All the competitors who have passed the selection will enter a special realm during the Pill Gathering. That place will be the best place for you to act&#x2026;&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;There is always a large number of people that end up remaining in that realm forever after each Pill Gathering. Therefore, even if Chen Xian really meets with an accident there, the Profound Xuan Sect would be hard-pressed to investigate&#x2026;&#x201D;</p><p>Xiao Yan&#x2019;s frowning eyebrows finally relaxed upon hearing this information. What Ye Zhong said was not without reason. The Profound Xuan Sect would not be easier to deal with than the Ice River Valley, much less the even more powerful Profound Sky Sect behind it. Once word of what happened leaked, it would likely end up attracting a lot of trouble. He had already provoked the Hall of Souls. If additional factions were to be added to his list of enemies, it would definitely end up making his situation a lot worse.</p><p>&#x201C;Elder Cheng from the Pill Tower has already arrived at the Ye manor. The reason he has hurried over so early is probably because he is worried that you will attack the people from the Profound Xuan Sect. After all, this is Holy Pill City. He needs to maintain the stability&#x2026;&#x201D; Ye Zhong said.</p><p>&#x201C;Elder Cheng is here?&#x201D; Xiao Yan was surprised.</p><p>&#x201C;That&#x2019;s right, he arrived very early this morning. However, he said that there was no need to wake you&#x2026;&#x201D;</p><p>Xiao Yan slightly knit his eyebrows. Elder Cheng&#x2019;s early arrival clearly hinted at the upper echelons of the Pill Tower. They did not wish him to fight all out with the Profound Xuan Sect at this moment. However, he understood them after some thought. Being the party that held the Pill Gathering, the Pill Tower did indeed hold the responsibility of maintaining order. The intervention of that expert from the Pill Tower last night should also be due to this reason.</p><p>&#x201C;Let&#x2019;s head to the front yard and meet Elder Cheng. I&#x2019;ll temporarily put this matter aside. Once I enter the realm you mentioned, I will seek Chen Xian out. I cannot simply treat this kind of thing like it never happened.&#x201D; Xiao Yan mused for a moment and gradually became much calmer. With a wave of his hand, he took the lead and walked to the front yard.</p><p>Ye Zhong sighed in relief upon hearing that Xiao Yan did not intend to attack at this moment. He hurriedly followed Xiao Yan after his sigh</p><p>When Xiao Yan and Ye Zhong hurried to the front yard, they coincidentally saw Elder Cheng seated in the leader&#x2019;s spot. The Little Fairy Doctor, Tian Huo zun-zhe, and Xin Lan were seated by his side.</p><p>&#x201C;Ke ke, you are finally here&#x2026;&#x201D; Elder Cheng laughed when Xiao Yan walked into the large hall. After which, he stood up and said, &#x201C;I think that Ye Zhong has informed you why the old me has come here. Let&#x2019;s not say any more unnecessary words. All of you should follow me to the Pill Tower. There will also be other Elders who will go and knock on the doors of the fellows from the Profound Xuan Sect. If you still feel uncomfortable in your heart, you will have opportunities in the future. At that time, the Pill Tower will not intervene or ask about the matter. However, this is a unique period of time. Hopefully, you will endure a little on account of the Pill Tower&#x2026;&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Elder Cheng really knows how to joke. Since you have already put it this way, the little me will naturally obey you&#x2026;&#x201D; Xiao Yan smiled. Currently, Holy Pill City was filled with people. All sorts of people were gathered in this place. Naturally, it would appear a little chaotic. If a fuse were to be lit during this period, trouble would explode forth. Hence, Xiao Yan understood the difficulty the Pill Tower faced.</p><p>&#x201C;Relax, we will not allow you to be wronged for nothing. Aren&#x2019;t you interested in Cao Ying&#x2019;s Spiritual Handprint. The Elder Seats have already discussed the matter. When you arrive at the Pill Tower, we will allow you to ponder that Soul Skill&#x2026;&#x201D; Elder Cheng smiled as he spoke.</p><p>Xiao Yan was initially startled when he heard Elder Cheng&#x2019;s words. Joy immediately surged into his eyes as he hurriedly cupped his hands together to thank Elder Cheng. That Spiritual Handprint might not be very high level, but it was suitable for him, who was a beginner when it came to Soul Skills. Moreover, the Spiritual Handprint he had learned from Cao Ying was incomplete. It would really benefit him if he could study it completely.</p><p>&#x201C;Since there is no problem, let&#x2019;s get moving. The association head wishes to meet you after we arrive at the Pill Tower&#x2026;&#x201D;</p><p>Elder Cheng smiled and took the lead to walk out of the Ye manor. Xiao Yan&#x2019;s group exchanged glances with each other before following him.</p><p>The Pill Tower was located in the center of Holy Pill City. This area was the one true holy ground in the hearts of countless numbers of alchemists. Due to Holy Pill City being filled with all sorts of people, the defenses in the inner region had become extremely tight, ready to deal with any sudden changes.</p><p>Xiao Yan&#x2019;s group followed Elder Cheng as they walked through Holy Pill City for nearly half an hour, but they gradually arrived at the inner area. The noise significantly diminished when Xiao Yan&#x2019;s group stepped through a gate to the inner region&#x2026;</p><p>Usually, only those factions with a strong relationship with the Pill Tower or high tier alchemists were allowed to stay in the inner region of the Holy Pill City. Hence, the quality within the inner region was completely different with that of the outer region.</p><p>Xiao Yan&#x2019;s group lifted their heads after stepping into the inner region. Their eyes paused on the thing in the center of the inner region. A thousand-foot-tall black tower stood at that spot. It appeared just like a small mountain peak, giving one a towering and magnificent feeling.</p><p>The top of the enormous tower penetrated through the cloud layer. At a glance, one was unable to see the peak. The cloud lingered over it, causing it to appear exceptionally mysterious&#x2026;</p><p>&#x201C;That is the Pill Tower huh&#x2026;&#x201D;</p><p>As Xiao Yan looked at the sky-supporting pillar of a tower, even he could not help but reveal a face that was filled with amazement. Compared to this Pill Tower, the lightning tower he had seen back at the Wind Lightning Pavilion was like a little child standing at the feet of a giant man&#x2026;</p><p>Elder Cheng smiled and nodded. He brought Xiao Yan&#x2019;s group into the human traffic on the main road, walking to the Pill Tower.</p><p>With Elder Cheng leading them, Xiao Yan&#x2019;s group passed through strict examination stations in an extremely smooth manner and entered the interior of the enormous Pill Tower&#x2026;</p><p>Elder Cheng first settled the Little Fairy Doctor and the rest in after having entered the Pill Tower. After which, he led Xiao Yan as they hurried to the top levels of the enormous tower. It was a long while later before they stopped in front of an extremely spacious hall.</p><p>&#x201C;Association head Xuan Kong is inside. He and your teacher were good friends back then. You should be respectful when you meet him&#x2026;&#x201D;</p><p>Xiao Yan&#x2019;s face became serious. He nodded when he heard Elder Cheng&#x2019;s reminder.</p><p>Elder Cheng only felt assured when he saw Xiao Yan nod his head. Elder Cheng tidied his clothes, took two steps forward, and respectfully pushed the door open. After which, he threw a look at Xiao Yan.</p><p>Xiao Yan slightly nodded and slowly entered...</p><p>The large hall was filled with many bookshelves. At a glance, it gave one a disorderly feeling. Many different-colored flames filled the hall. Under the mixture of these many colors of light, one would feel as though one was in a blurry dream state.</p><p>Xiao Yan&#x2019;s footsteps gently landed on the stone floor. His eyes swept around before pausing in front of a bookshelf a moment later. A white-clothed, old man was carefully dusting the bookshelf.</p><p>That white-clothed old man did not have the slightest aura seeping out of him. He appeared just like an extremely ordinary, old man. However, when Xiao Yan used his Spiritual Perception, he was startled to realize that the area in front of him was completely empty. The white-clothed, old man appeared as though he did not exist&#x2026;</p><p>&#x201C;Ha ha, you must be Xiao Yan right? That old fellow&#x2019;s eyesight really causes others to feel envious&#x2026;&#x201D;</p><p>The white-clothed, old man ceased dusting when Xiao Yan was respectfully standing a short distance behind him. An old voice filled with vicissitude suddenly resounded over the interior of the hall.</p>
