<p><strong><u>Chapter 1254: Reunion of Old Friends</u></strong></p><p>The Triple Jade-Green Snake Flower Pupils was an extremely mysterious pair of eyes in this world. In terms of rarity, it was likely even rarer than Little Fairy Doctor&#x2019;s Woeful Poison Body. Xiao Yan had merely seen the Triple Jade-Green Snake Flower Pupils once during all these years. That was during the time when he was within the mercenary company that his big and second brother had established while he was training within the Jia Ma Empire. However, the owner of the Triple Jade-Green Snake Flower Pupils that time was merely a timid little girl. She was a pitiful little female servant who had been mocked and viewed with great discrimination because of her Snake-Person bloodline.</p><p>Back then, Xiao Yan had never viewed this little girl as a servant due to him pitting the miserable past that she had. Not only did he help her walk out from her timidness but had also provided her with much care. After he had returned from his training within the desert, he had discovered that this little girl was already captured by the Mo clan. In order to rescue her, Xiao Yan had used many tactics and create a great mess in the Mo clan before he eventually rescued her. At the last moment, however, the members of the so called Sky Serpent Mansion finally intervened and snatched her away. Although Yao Lao had said that the Sky Serpent Mansion would definitely treat her well, Xiao Yan&#x2019;s heart had always remembered that timid young girl during these years&#x2026;</p><p>The name of that little girl was Qing Lin. At the same time, she was also the owner of the Triple Jade-Green Snake Flower Pupils!</p><p>That girl was also startled upon hearing the exclamation from Xiao Yan&#x2019;s mouth. Her eyes were extremely surprised as she looked at him and asked, &#x201C;You&#x2026; how do you know my name?&#x201D;</p><p>The surprise in Xiao Yan&#x2019;s eyes became even denser when he heard this. He had never expert that this opponent, whom he was greatly afraid of, would actually be that little female servant from back then.</p><p>Xiao Yan&#x2019;s expression involuntarily became a little strange when he thought of this. After having not met her for so many years, the gentle and weak little girl from back then had grown up to be slim and tall. She could be considered a great beauty. One was also no longer able to see her timidness from back then.</p><p>&#x201C;What is it?&#x201D;</p><p>Little Fairy Doctor and the others also flashed over. Their eyes swept over the two of them in a strange manner and asked.</p><p>&#x201C;Chi!&#x201D;</p><p>Xiao Yan involuntarily laughed as he stared intently at the exquisite melon face that was filled with doubt. He shifted away the Heavy Xuan Ruler from Qing Lin&#x2019;s throat and slammed it heavily onto the ground. He laughed, &#x201C;Little girl, do you still recognise this ruler?&#x201D;</p><p>Qing Lin blinked her eyes. Her gaze looked at the large Heavy Xuan Ruler in front of her. Her eyebrows were bunched up. This thing gave her a familiar feeling. Even this smiling young man in front of her caused her to feel a familiarity. It appeared that these things had been present deep within her memories.</p><p>&#x201C;Jia Ma Empire, Vast Tager Desert, Desert Metal Mercenary Company&#x2026;&#x201D;</p><p>Xiao Yan smilingly looked at Qing Lin in deep thought and laughingly reminded.</p><p>Qing Lin&#x2019;s body suddenly trembled when she heard these three sentences. Her eyes immediately widened. She looked at Xiao Yan in front of her with great disbelief. After which, she stammered, &#x201C;Xiao&#x2026; young master Xiao Yan?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;You have finally remembered huh&#x2026;&#x201D; Xiao Yan smiled and involuntarily rubbed Qing Lin&#x2019;s head. He sighed, &#x201C;We have not met for so many years. You have really grown up&#x2026;&#x201D;</p><p>Qing Lin&#x2019;s face and eyes immediately turned red and moist when her head was being rubbed by Xiao Yan. Her heart clearly understood how Xiao Yan treated her back then. After having been brought to the Sky Serpent Mansion, she was also aware of just how Xiao Yan took a great risk to head to the Mo clan to rescue her. She had cried for a long time because of this back then. At that time, she was still a timid little girl. She had always thought of herself as Xiao Yan&#x2019;s female servant. However, she did not expect that Xiao Yan was actually willing to take such a risk for her, a lowly female servant. In the heart of this little girl, who had experienced the cool indifference of the world, it was a matter that she could not imagine.</p><p>Little Fairy Doctor and the rest by the side saw this situation that had completely taken a turn around. All of them were unable to recover. Amongst those present, only Little Fairy Doctor was acquainted with Xiao Yan earlier than Qing Lin. However, at that time, she had went to the Chu Yun Empire alone. Naturally, she had also not seen Qing Lin.</p><p>&#x201C;What situation is this?&#x201D; Zi Yan muttered.</p><p>Zi Yan and the rest also shook their heads. They were also uncertain just how this dramatic scene had come about.</p><p>&#x201C;You are not injured, are you?&#x201D; Xiao Yan recalled the timid little female servant from back then as he looked at Qing Lin. He involuntarily spoke in a gentle voice.</p><p>&#x201C;Aye&#x2026; I&#x2019;m fine.. Xiao Yan&#x2026;&#x201D; Qing Lin spoke in a somewhat hurried manner. Due to the memories left behind in her youth being too deep, even though she currently possessed the powerful strength of a top tier expert in the continent, she still felt a kind of restraint under the smile of Xiao Yan for some unknown reason. It was just like a child meeting a stern parent.</p><p>&#x201C;If you don&#x2019;t mine, you can call me big brother Xiao Yan.&#x201D; Xiao Yan thought that Qing Lin was unable to say the words &#x2018;young master&#x2019; that she had smoothly uttered back then when he saw this manner of Qing Lin. He immediately laughed. Currently, Qing Lin was no longer that young female servant from back then. With her matured Triple Jade-Green Snake Flower Pupils, it was likely that no one on this continent could take her in as a female servant.</p><p>&#x201C;No no&#x2026; I will still&#x2026; still call you young master Xiao Yan. I like to call you this.&#x201D; Qing Lin hurriedly shook her head when she heard this. Her hands were anxiously crossed together. How did this manner of hers look like the murder that had turned rhe Nine Serene Deep Ground Python tribe upside down?</p><p>Xiao Yan smiled but did not mind. His eyes stared at Qing Lin as he said, &#x201C;Back then, you were rescued from the hands of the Mo clan but was finally being brought away by the people from the Sky Serpent Mansion. How did they treat you?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Aye, they treat me very well and even intends for me to helm the Sky Serpent Mansion. However, the Elders which to match me with the eldest son of the previous chief. I was unwilling so I ended up secretly running away&#x2026;&#x201D; Qing Lin nodded. However, she did not say everything. After having secretly run away, she had first made a trip to the Jia Ma Empire. However, everything was already different. After some inquiry, she finally became aware that Xiao Yan had headed to the Central Plains. Since she had nothing to do, she also travelled a great distance to this place. Part of the reason was to tour and gain experience but most of it was because she wanted to find a certain person who had left a deep impression in her heart.</p><p>Due to the Triple Jade-Green Snake Flower Pupils, her status during these years was different. There were also many people around her who began to court her favour. However, the one whom she really could not forget was the young master, who was also quiet young, while she was still a helpless young female servant back then. He would actually take such a big risk to rescue her.</p><p>The thing that was most worthwhile to recall is the events and people they experience and met when they were at their lowest point in life. This was because the people and events at that time were truly able to leave behind an impression that could not be removed deep within one&#x2019;s hearts.</p><p>Fortunately, the heavens rewarded those who were resolute. The person whom she was finding these years had finally appeared in front of her when she least expected it.</p><p>&#x201C;That&#x2026; young master Xiao Yan, this&#x2026;&#x201D;</p><p>Qing Lin crossed her hands. A green light suddenly flashed within her eyes. A snow white little beast had once again appeared in her hand. The latter immediately widened its stride and rushed into Xiao Yan&#x2019;s embrace once it was released. It trembled and revealed a frightened expression in its eyes as it looked at Qing Lin.</p><p>Xiao Yan rubbed the Pill Beast in his embrace and involuntarily laughed. He asked, &#x201C;Do you need the Pill Beast?&#x201D;</p><p>Qing Lin hurriedly shook her head when she heard this. However, after being stared at by Xiao Yan&#x2019;s gaze, she finally muttered, &#x201C;I wanted to use the blood of the Pill Beast to remove the poison within my body.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Remove poison?&#x201D; Xiao Yan&#x2019;s heart sunk. He extended his hand and said, &#x201C;Give your hand to me. I&#x2019;ll take a look.&#x201D;</p><p>Qing Lin hesitated for a moment before extending her delicate hand. After which, she placed it into Xiao Yan&#x2019;s palm. The warm large hand of the latter caused her to become flush.</p><p>Xiao Yan did not pay attention to all of these. A thought passed through his mind and a wisp of Spiritual Strength entered Qing Lin&#x2019;s body from her hand. After a careful observation, he involuntarily tightened his brows. He discovered that Qin Ling&#x2019;s body and even her blood were all mixed with poisonous Qi. This kind of poisonous Qi was dark and icy. It appeared to be intending to freeze one&#x2019;s blood and was extremely vicious.</p><p>&#x201C;What poison is this?&#x201D; Xiao Yan frowned and asked.</p><p>&#x201C;This is the Emperor Python Heart Eroding Poison of the Nine Serene Deep Ground Python tribe. It is one of the top mysterious poison in this world. It is rumoured to be without any antidote.&#x201D; Qing Lin said.</p><p>&#x201C;There is nothing certain in nature. Positive and negative, Yin and Yang, these are the rules of nature. If there is poison, there will be an antidote. Those that are said to be without antidote are those which antidote had yet to be found.&#x201D; Xiao Yan shook his head. His expression had become a little serious when he spoke until this point. It was likely that he had had also heard of this so called Emperor Python Heart Eroding Poison.</p><p>&#x201C;It is rumoured that the blood within the bodies of those medicinal pills that could turn into a beast can cure most poisons. Therefore, I have come here to try my luck. Unexpectedly, I have really met it&#x2026;&#x201D; Qing Lin glanced at the snow white little beast in Xiao Yan&#x2019;s embrace and said.</p><p>&#x201C;A medicinal pill of this quality is indeed able to resist quite a number of poisons. However, just this alone is insufficient to completely remove the blockage within your body.&#x201D; Little Fairy Doctor by the side also opened her mouth and said. She was an expert in using poison. Naturally, she had the right to speak.</p><p>&#x201C;Aye. However, it is not too much of a problem. With the help of the blood of a Pill Beast, it is not impossible to remove this Emperor Python Heart Eroding Poison despite its lethality.&#x201D; Xiao Yan nodded. He immediately frowned slightly and asked, &#x201C;Why would you offend the Nine Serene Deep Ground Python tribe? They are not a group that one can easily offend.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;I am not the one who offend them. They are the ones who had come and offend me.&#x201D; Qing Lin was a little wronged as she said, &#x201C;When I had come to the Beast Region back then, I was merely intending to find some powerful snake form Magical Beast. How could I expect to end up meeting an Elder of the Nine Serene Deep Ground Python tribe. He had recognised my eyes and intend to capture me. I could only retaliate. Finally, I end up controlling him. However, he had released some news at the last moment and caused the entire Nine Serene Deep Ground Python tribe to come and capture me. Finally, I can only capture some unlucky fellows&#x2026;&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;The Triple Jade-Green Snake Flower Pupils is the nemesis of all snake form Magical Beast. Other than those few snake form Magical Beasts that possess pure ancient bloodlines like Cai Lin jie-jie&#x2019;s Seven-Coloured Heaven Swallowing Python, the others will be in great danger when facing the Triple Jade-Green Snake Flower Pupils. It will be strange if others do not capture you, given you possess such a thing.&#x201D; Zi Yan curled her mouth. She still felt some grudge because of the night that Qing Lin attacked her.</p><p>Xiao Yan smiled. He patted Qing Lin&#x2019;s shoulder and said, &#x201C;It&#x2019;s fine. There is no need to be worried. Although this poison is troublesome, it is not impossible to cure. However, this place is currently not the best place to remove the poison. Once we leave the remains, I will think of a way to help you expel the poison. Why don&#x2019;t you follow beside me before this.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Aye.&#x201D; Qing Lin&#x2019;s face reddened as she nodded gently.</p><p>Xiao Yan smiled and stood up. With such a great helper by their side, their lineup had once again swiftly strengthen a little. Should they meet Feng Qing Er&#x2019;s group again, just this lineup would be able to suppress them!</p>
