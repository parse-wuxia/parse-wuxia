<p><strong><u>Chapter 25<u><strong>:</strong>&#xA0;</u>I&#x2019;ll Pay for It</u></strong></p><p>After he sneaked back into his room, Xiao Yan quickly closed the door and went to the corner of the room, before finally taking out a bunch of medical herbs and magic crystals. He carefully placed them in the cabinet and deeply sniffed the smell of herbs as he smiled with relief.</p><p>To practice uninterrupted, Xiao Yan had purchased the amount of herbs needed for 8 months of usage, allowing him to practice non-stop for the rest of the year.</p><p>As he affectionately patted the cabinet, his lips cracked open and he lazily goes on the side of his bed, putting his head down. Today&#x2019;s activities had made him really tired</p><p>&#x201C;Yan Er, are you there?&#x201D; A mumbled voice and a knock pass through his door..</p><p>Opening his blurry eyes, Xiao Yan hurriedly jumped out of his bed, then opened his room&#x2019;s door, looking at Xiao Zhao outside of the door and asked: &#x201C;Father, do you need something?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Can&#x2019;t I see for you even if I don&#x2019;t need anything from you? You kid, you hid from me for 2 months.&#x201D; Xiao Zhan reprimanded as he rubbed Xiao Yan&#x2019;s head affectionately.</p><p>Looking at Xiao Zhan&#x2019;s warm smiling face, Xiao Yan&#x2019;s was moved as he pumped his sore nose, not knowing what to say.</p><p>&#x201C;Are you still feeling responsible for that ? Haha, if she can&#x2019;t take a liking to my son, it is her loss. You don&#x2019;t have to be sad. Why should a great man act like a little kid? I know that this son of Xiao Zhan, is not a cripple.&#x201D; Xiao Zhan boldly said.</p><p>&#x201C;Haha father, after 3 years, Yan Er will go to the Faction of Misty Clouds personally.&#x201D; Xiao Yan said in a soft voice with a smile.</p><p>Xiao Zhao&#x2019;s smiling face became more serious, as he stared at Xiao Yan. After a while, he said with some hesitation: &#x201C;Father feels fine, but&#x2026; are you really going to? Father isn&#x2019;t saying that you can&#x2019;t reach Nalan Yanran, but the strength of the Faction of Misty Clouds&#x2026;&#x201D;</p><p>Xiao Yan smiled as he nodded, his thin lips forcing a somewhat stubborn line: &#x201C;Father, that there are some things, that as a man, I have to bear.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Aha, this temper of your resembles mine much, if your two big brothers knew that you thought like this, they would probably be very happy&#x201D;, Towards Xiao Yan&#x2019;s dedication, Xiao Zhan smiled pleased before sighing and nodded heavily: &#x201C;Good, father waits for his son to give him some face, I want the old bastard Nalan Shu to beg me to remake that marriage promise.&#x201D;</p><p>Xiao Yan nodded and couldn&#x2019;t help but laugh.</p><p>&#x201C;Hey, I&#x2019;ll give you this, consider it as your father&#x2019;s support.&#x201D; He handed to Xiao Yan a very familiar white bottle.</p><p>Looking at this elixir that went back to his own hands, Xian Yan didn&#x2019;t know whether to laugh or to cry. But on his face, he maintained a puzzled expression : &#x201C;Father, this is?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Foundation Elixir, it&#x2019;ll accelerate your Dou Qi cultivation, I just bought it today.&#x201D; Xiao Zhan&#x2019;s mouth smiled.</p><p>&#x201C;You must have spent a lot of money for this right?&#x201D; As he received the white jade bottle, Xiao Yan&#x2019;s heart felt warm.</p><p>&#x201C;40 000 gold coins, but if it can be of use to you, it is worth its price &#x201D; Xiao Zhan smiled as though he didn&#x2019;t care.</p><p>&#x201C;You spent 40 000 gold coins for buying me this foundation spirit elixir? Won&#x2019;t the elders perhaps cause trouble to you using this excuse?&#x201D; Xiao Yan smiled bitterly.</p><p>&#x201C;Tssk, I am the Clan Leader, they can at most utter some words&#x201D; Xiao Zhan said coldly.</p><p>&#x201C;Father, thank you, during the adult ceremony in one year, I will make them shut their mouth completely&#x201D;. Xiao Yan calmly laughed as he said that.</p><p>&#x201C;Good, I am waiting for my son to transform once more !&#x201D; Although he didn&#x2019;t know from where Xiao Yan&#x2019;s confidence came from, Xiao Zhan was very happy seeing his son&#x2019;s confident appearance.</p><p>&#x201C;Alright, I won&#x2019;t disturb your rest. If there are any problems come and see your father, as a family member, I cannot let you be disgraced.&#x201D; Waving his hand, Xiao Zhan turned around, as he took big strides leaving the front yard.</p><p>&#x201C;Shit, I also have to face these old fools now. I only spent 40 000 Gold Coins, but they will act like I had spent the money that was supposed to be used for buying their coffins.&#x201D; From the night, Xiao Zhan&#x2019;s mutters floated to Xiao Yan.</p><p>Looking at his father vanish into the darkness, Xiao Yan touched his nose and smiled while saying in a low voice:&#x201D;Relax, father, I will use reality to make these people quiet. 3 years before, I could make them look up at me, 3 years after, I will still be able to !&#x201D;</p><p>After standing at his door for a while, Xiao Yan put away the white jade bottle. Then, he shot a look at the corner of the room, teasing: &#x201D;Girl ! Is it fun to eavesdrop on people?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Xiao Yan ge-ge, that was keen from you&#x2026;&#x2026;.&#x201D; From the corner, a pretty young girl wearing a purple skirt came out elegantly. Leaning her little head, a big smile was revealed on her beautiful face.</p><p>Looking at the mischievous girl&#x2019;s face, Xiao Yan helplessly shook his head.</p><p>&#x201C;Where did Xiao Yan ge-ge go this afternoon?&#x201D; Xun Er came forward, walked up lightly and asked with a smile.</p><p>&#x201C;I was just on a little stroll.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Is that so?&#x201D; Her eyes looking up and down, Xun Er suddenly took a step forward and bent slightly. Her nose wrinkled while she said: &#x201C;I smell the fragrance of a woman.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;*Cough*, come on, why would I have a woman&#x2019;s fragrance.&#x201D; Xiao Yan&#x2019;s immature face suddenly blushed, but in the dark, his as well as the girl&#x2019;s face couldn&#x2019;t be seen clearly.</p><p>&#x201C;Hee hee.&#x201D; Seemingly liking this predicament Xiao Yan was in, Xun Er laughed and a moment later, stopped laughing. Before quietly saying : &#x201D;A moment ago, I also heard Xiao shu-shu&#x2019;s words, I believe that Xiao Yan ge&#x2013;ge, yup&#x2026;&#x2026;. In the future, you really want to go to the Faction of the Misty Clouds, Xun Er will come with you, to help you&#x2026;&#x2026;&#x201D;</p><p>Hearing this, Xiao Yan blinked and tightly stared at the young girl&#x2019;s beautiful small face.</p><p>Under Xiao Yan&#x2019;s unrestrained vision, Xun Er&#x2019;s her face flushed a little from shyness as she whispered :&#x201D;Xiao Yan ge-ge, what are you looking at&#x2026;..&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Hehe, Xun Er can also blush, such a rare sight.&#x201D; Xiao Yan unexpectedly said with a smile.</p><p>Xun Er coldly glanced at Xiao Yan and she muttered under her breath: &#x201D;And you can also glance at people this way.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Good, good, have confidence in ge-ge, although the Faction of Misty Clouds is formidable, I am still young. This Yun Yun who spoils that girl Nalan Yanran, definitely isn&#x2019;t too great of a teacher.&#x201C; Xiao Yan smiled as he rubbed the black hair of the young girl. &#x201C;Well, it is late, head back for a rest.&#x201D;</p><p>Looking at Xiao Yan waving, Xun Er shakes her head reluctantly. And went into the darkness under his sight.</p><p>After turning a corner, sounds could be heard from a quarrel between Xiao Zhan and the several elders. The topic of the quarrel: how the 40 000 gold coins were used.</p><p>Stopping, Xun Er&#x2019;s little eyebrows wrinkled and she lets out a small sigh while a purple card appeared between her slim fingers.</p><p>Her fingertips flicking the purple colored gold-card, making the purple-gold card flash into golden light as it soared towards the room where the elders are quarrelling with Xiao Zhan.</p><p>The room suddenly became silent while Xun Er faintly said: &#x201D;This is the money for the Foundation Elixir. In this card there are 100,000 gold coins, now that I&#x2019;ve given you this, I hope that you elders won&#x2019;t continue to give uncle Xiao trouble.&#x201D;</p><p>The room was completely silent before the &#x201C;yes&#x201D; acknowledgments from the three elders came through.</p><p><br></p><hr><p><br></p>
