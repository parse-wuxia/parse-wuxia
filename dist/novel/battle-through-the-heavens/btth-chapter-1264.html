<p><strong><u>Chapter 1264: Fighting for the Skeleton</u></strong></p><p>During the time that Xiao Yan&#x2019;s breathing had become heavier because of the Dou Sheng skeleton, old ghost Zhai Xing on the square also revealed a wild joy that could not be hidden on his face. The residue spiritual imprint that the elite Dou Sheng had left behind also completely disappeared. Currently, this skeleton no longer possess any offensive abilities.</p><p>Although his heart understood that the bones currently did not possess any danger, old ghost Zhai Xing did not immediately act despite being filled with anxiety due to the frightening palm from earlier.</p><p>&#x201C;Are you alright?&#x201D;</p><p>Xiao Yan stood up from the ground. Little Fairy Doctor&#x2019;s group hurried over and asked in a worried manner.</p><p>Xiao Yan smiled and shook his head. He saw that those in front of him were not injured and his heart sighed in relief.</p><p>&#x201C;Fortunately, you have warned us in time. Otherwise, the result will be unpredictable. That palm from the Dou Sheng skeleton was really too frightening. It was likely that no one here could receive it&#x2026;&#x201D; Tian Huo zun-zhe&#x2019;s eyes had some shocked expression. It was the first time that he had seen such a frightening Dou Technique.</p><p>&#x201C;This should be the legendary Tian class Dou Technique. Moreover, this was the destructive force created by a residue soul that the elite Dou Sheng had left behind. If it was to be unleashed by a genuine elite Dou Sheng, it was likely that the large hall would not be the only thing that disappeared. Instead, it would be the entire remains or even&#x2026; half of the Bone Mountain Range.&#x201D; Little Fairy Doctor spoke softly.</p><p>Xiao Yan nodded. He had personally experienced the strength of this thing. If it was not because he had reacted quickly earlier, it was likely that he would be turned into a powder like existence after having been absorbed into the black light circle.</p><p>&#x201C;Hee hee, quite a number of people here are unlucky&#x2026;&#x201D; Zi Yan laughed quietly in a somewhat gloating manner.</p><p>Xiao Yan&#x2019;s eyes swept over the square and did indeed discovered that the originally large crowd currently only had a few people remaining. Moreover, most of these people, who had survived, had a horror that covered their faces. Cold sweat soaked their clothes. These people could really be considered to have been completely frightened.</p><p>&#x201C;Unfortunately, those scrolls have also been destroyed&#x2026;&#x201D; Qing Lin spoke in a somewhat regretful manner.</p><p>&#x201C;The treasure in this place is not those scrolls. Instead, it is that Dou Sheng skeleton.&#x201D; Xiao Yan smiled. His fiery hot eyes looked towards the jade white skeleton that was suspended on the enormous deep pit. The skeleton not only hid the Tian class Dou Technique on it but its body itself possessed a shocking amount of allure. Anything left behind by an elite Dou Sheng were all top tier treasure.</p><p>&#x201C;Most of those who has survived until now are experts with some abilities. However, it is fortunate that they were all injured. From the looks of it, the strength of our side is the preserved most completely.&#x201D; Tian Huo zun-zhe spoke softly.</p><p>Xiao Yan smiled slightly and softly said, &#x201C;There is no need to hurry. Someone will eventually act from impatience.&#x201D;</p><p>Little Fairy Doctor&#x2019;s group was startled when they heard Xiao Yan&#x2019;s words. His gaze glanced towards the direction where old ghost Zhai Xing was located. He could see that this old ghost current had a face with a wild joy that could not be hidden.</p><p>&#x201C;This damn thing has killed so many experts from my Hall of Soul. Today, the old me shall act and turn this skeleton into dust!&#x201D;</p><p>Old ghost Zhai Xing suddenly stood up when they eyes of Little Fairy Doctor&#x2019;s group glanced over. He cried out in a righteous manner. After which, his body moved, transforming into a blurry figure that rushed over towards the Dou Sheng skeleton in the air above the deep hole.</p><p>&#x201C;Humph, do you really treat us as fools? We have scattered the residue soul within the Dou Sheng skeleton after much hard work. Will we allow you to gain such a great reward?&#x201D; Huang Xuan, Tang Zhen and Bing He zun-zhe let out a cold snort when old ghost Zhai Xing&#x2019;s body moved. With their eyesight, they were naturally able to tell that this Dou Sheng skeleton was extraordinary. How would they allow old ghost Zhai Xing to obtain such a treasure for no reason?</p><p>The three of them moved their bodies at the same time when their cry sounded. With a couple of flashes, they had caught up with old ghost Zhai Xing. Each of them threw a palm towards the air. The frightening wind directly tore three dark black crack lines in the air.</p><p>The fierce attack that rushed over from behind also caused old ghost Zhai Xing&#x2019;s face to change. The strength of Feng Xuan&#x2019;s group was similar to his. Currently, the three of them had attacked together. How could he forcefully receive it? His body twisted strangely and a couple of afterimages appeared in the midair and narrowly dodged the three wind. Their speed also end up being reduced.</p><p>Huang Xuan and the two others rushed out after having blocked old ghost Zhai Xing. After which, they flew over the latter&#x2019;s head. Their large hands directly grabbed onto the Dou Sheng skeleton in a violent manner.</p><p>&#x201C;Bastards, you are seeking death!&#x201D;</p><p>Old ghost Zhai Xing&#x2019;s face was filled with fury when he saw this scene. The feelings from having joined hands earlier had already completely vanished. His hand grabbed across the space and a suction force erupted from it. It had actually directly stiled the three figures in the midair for an instant. He also took the chance to flash his body. He took a step forward ahead of the others, grabbed with his large hand and caught an arm of the Dou Sheng skeleton in the process. Before he could pull with his strength, however, an incomparably sharp wind violently hacked towards his head from behind.</p><p>Upon sensing this sharp wind from behind, the hand of old ghost Zhai Xing, which was grabbing onto the Dou Sheng skeleton, was suddenly swung. He directly used to skeleton to block his back. It was forcefully being used to block the palm wind from Huang Xuan trio.</p><p>&#x201C;Bang!&#x201D;</p><p>Powerful wind exploded on his bones. A strong force shook old ghost Zhai Xing until he was being forced back. However, with the defence of the skeleton, he was not hurt.</p><p>The wild joy on old ghost Zhai Xing&#x2019;s face became increasingly dense as he grabbed the Dou Sheng skeleton. He did not say anything as he held the skeleton and fled.</p><p>&#x201C;Hee, you wish to escape?&#x201D;</p><p>A ghost like figure appeared in front of old ghost Zhai Xing just as he turned around. An enormous ruler that was accompanied by a fierce wind directly hacked viciously at him.</p><p>&#x201C;Clang!&#x201D;</p><p>The heavy ruler hacked onto the skeleton. Numerous sparks erupted. Xiao Yan&#x2019;s arm was also shaken until it became numb. Fortunately, that force also shook old ghost Zhai Xing until he took a step back. At this moment, Huang Xuan trio had once again caught up. They similarly remained silent. However, Dou Qi violently attacked the fatal spots all over old ghost Zhai Xing&#x2019;s body in an extremely ruthless manner.</p><p>Everyone on the square were stunned as they looked at the five people, who had suddenly end up in a life and death battle because of a skeleton. With their eyesight, they were naturally able to tell that every strike from these people were ruthless. Clearly, they intended to kill the other party.</p><p>&#x201C;It looks like that Dou Sheng skeleton is the treasure. Otherwise, it will not cause experts like old ghost Zhai Xing to go all out to snatch it.&#x201D;</p><p>Those who could still survive after experiencing the various danger were naturally not some ordinary character. They understood the reason with just the blink of an eye. Immediately, his eyes flickered. Some of the bolder individuals involuntarily stood up and showed signs of intending to intervene.</p><p>&#x201C;Humph, I advice those whose strength has yet to reach that of a three star Dou Zun to forget about such thoughts!&#x201D;</p><p>When these fellows were about to act, the experts from the Heaven Demon Phoenix Tribe, Ice River Valley and the Burning Flame Valley stood in front of the large pit with icy cold expressions. Powerful aura spread swiftly.</p><p>The faces of quite a number of people changed slightly upon seeing this. The combined strength of these few large fractions possessed quite a powerful strength. Even though they had some skills, they were unable to finish off all of these factions. Moreover, there were still a couple of genuine top expert in the midair. Even if they could charge over, it was likely that they would be unable to fight with them.</p><p>These people could only shake their heads unwillingly when they thought of this in their heart. They abandon the greedy thought within his heart. Natural treasures were things obtained by those with ability. They were only a source of trouble for those without any ability.</p><p>Little Fairy Doctor&#x2019;s group sighed in relief when he saw that these fellows were deterred. They similarly did not wish for anyone else to intervene in the fight for the skeleton. Should that occur, it would only end up causing the situation to be even more chaotic.</p><p>............</p><p>Old ghost Zhai Xing appeared quite miserable when he was surrounded and attacked by the three experts with similar strength. Old ghost Zhai Xing was also quite miserable. After enduring for over a dozen exchanges, he finally began to feel a little tired and chose to pull back.</p><p>Although he wished to pull back, Huang Xuan&#x2019;s group did not give him the chance to do so. After a fight, the three of them found an opportunity. Vast and mighty Dou Qi directly struck violently on the shoulder of the Dou Sheng skeleton.</p><p>Three waves of vast and mighty Dou Qi struck onto the same spot of the skeleton at the same time. The strength could split the mountain and burn the sea.</p><p>&#x201C;Crack!&#x201D;</p><p>The Dou Sheng skeleton was indeed extremely hard. However, it was also unable to endure this kind of all out destruction. Immediately, a crack sound appeared. Old ghost Zhai Xing grabbed firmly on the Dou Sheng bones. Its left hand had actually directly being broken by Huang Feng and the two others!</p><p>&#x201C;Bastard!&#x201D;</p><p>The bone in old ghost Zhai Xing&#x2019;s hand was flung off. His face was green as he grabbed onto the jade white broken arm and roared furiously. His body flashed and flew towards the skeleton that</p><p>had been flung off. However, his body had yet to reach it when a young figure appeared earlier than him. It grabbed the Dou Sheng skeleton with a broken left arm in his hands.</p><p>&#x201C;Xiao Yan, you are seeking death!&#x201D;</p><p>Old ghost Zhai Xing immediately became furious when he saw the skeleton being obtained by Xiao Yan.</p><p>Xiao Yan ignored old ghost Zhai Xing&#x2019;s roar. His gaze swept over the place and other than Tang Zhen, both Huang Xuan and Bing He zun-zhe had also charged over with killing intent on their faces. Purple-brown flame hurriedly lingered within his palm. He grabbed the three ribs with strange hidden characters from the skeleton&#x2019;s stomach. After which, he pulled violently with all his strength!</p><p>&#x201C;Crack!&#x201D;</p><p>The Dou Sheng skeleton was extremely hard. Xiao Yan had used all of his strength in order to barely break the three somewhat weak ribs.</p><p>A coolness spread over Xiao Yan&#x2019;s hands when the ribs landed in it. They appeared just like the best quality jade. His eyes swiftly glanced over, only to see unusual characters covering the ribs. An extremely faint luster flickered from these characters. At a glance, they appeared alive and were slowly wiggling.</p><p>Xiao Yan did not observe them carefully at this moment. He kept them into his Storage Ring almost immediately. At the same time, his heart was also pounding intensely because of the excitement. Regardless of what happened, he had obtained this precious object. Since he had already obtained it, everyone could forget about getting him to spit it out today.</p><p>The Tian class Dou Technique belonged to Xiao Yan!</p>
