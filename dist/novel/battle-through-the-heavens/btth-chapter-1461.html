<p><strong><u>Chapter 1461: Yao Xiaotian</u></strong></p><p>Xiao Yan extended his hand and received the blood coloured crystal body suspended in front of him. A frighteningly dark and cold force spread from his hand. It immediately began to freeze one of Xiao Yan&#x2019;s hands.</p><p>&#x201C;It is indeed the Spring Blood Crystal. This dark and cold force is really frightening&#x2026;&#x201D;</p><p>Xiao Yan nodded joyously after seeing this crystal. He shook his hand and the ice crystal cracked. After which, he put the blood crystals into his Storage Ring. He looked at that Yao Ming and asked, &#x201C;How can I rescue you? Do I destroy these four metal chains?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;There is no need for that. These metal chains are not the ones things that restrain me. Instead, it is the Yellow Spring Yin Rock attached to the ends of the chains. There is an endless dark and cold force surging from it that exhausts the Dou Qi within my body, causing me to remain in a weak state&#x2026; there is an elaborate switch hidden between the metal chain and the mountain body. Once you shatter it, these metal chains will no longer be able to trap me despite being made of a unique material.&#x201D; Yao Ming shook his head and replied.</p><p>&#x201C;Oh?&#x201D;</p><p>Xiao Yan slightly lifted his eyebrows. He moved and appeared at the end of a metal chain. He saw that the metal chain was indeed deeply inserted into a dark-black mountain-like outcropping. This mountain-shape was not large. It was only over a hundred feet in size, but the dark and cold force contained within it caused Xiao Yan to involuntarily shudder despite having the protection of a Heavenly Flame.</p><p>&#x201C;Is this the Yellow Spring Yin Rock?&#x201D;</p><p>Xiao Yan clenched his fist as he looked at the dark-black mountain. A vast and mighty Dou Qi surged and ruthlessly smashed into the mountain body.</p><p>&#x201C;Bang!&#x201D;</p><p>An enormous water wave spread with a rumble from the spot where Xiao Yan&#x2019;s fist landed. However, that dark-black mountain merely trembled. Xiao Yan&#x2019;s punch, which could seriously injure an elite Ban Sheng, failed to even leave behind a slight imprint on this rock.</p><p>&#x201C;The Yellow Spring Yin Rock has been refined by the dark and cold force in the spring for an uncountable number of years. It is extremely hard, possibly even indestructible. Even if I recover my strength, it would still be extremely difficult for me to destroy it.&#x201D; Yao Ming spoke in a hoarse voice after seeing the commotion that Xiao Yan stirred.</p><p>Xiao Yan slightly knit his brows. He suddenly grabbed a metal chain with his hand and a sizzling white fog was emitted. He quickly removed his hand. A thick white frost had already spread across his palm. The interior of this metal chain seemed to be a void that was filled with a dark and cold force. Only now did he understand why this Yao Ming had been locked in this place for centuries&#x2026;</p><p>Yao Ming&#x2019;s shriveled face revealed some disappointment after seeing that Xiao Yan&#x2019;s many attempts were futile.</p><p>&#x201C;The things in this Nine Serene Spring are indeed extraordinary&#x2026;&#x201D; Xiao Yan shook his head. He ceased doing anything pointless. He curled two fingers and an extremely pressurized wisp of his Heavenly Flame rose. It acted like a needle as it was gently inserted into the point where the metal chain had been inserted into the mountain body. A long while later, he finally touched an unusually hard circular object. He increased the force from his finger and the fire needle was ruthlessly inserted into that hard pellet-like object.</p><p>&#x201C;Crack!&#x201D;</p><p>The moment the fire needle pierced the pellet, Xiao Yan quickly sensed an unusual ripple that was emitted from the outcropping. That enormous metal chain actually broke apart.</p><p>&#x201C;He has actually succeeded?&#x201D;</p><p>Yao Ming, who was feeling a little disappointed in his heart, lifted his head. He looked at Xiao Yan with eyes that were filled with wild joy.</p><p>While Xiao Yan was breaking Yao Ming&#x2019;s seal, it was extremely lively within a magnificent palace in the underground Serene Snake network. The leaders of the many Snake-People tribes had gathered there as their laughter echoed through the large hall.</p><p>A black-clothed man was seated on the throne within the palace. He appeared quite handsome, but there was a dark chillness, which could not be hidden, on his brow. Both of his eyes were slightly shut. A glint flickered in them. His eyes appeared like poisonous snakes that could kill a person in an instant, leaving a chill in one&#x2019;s heart.</p><p>Two ladies with enchanting figures carefully massaged the man&#x2019;s body as his large hand continuously roamed over the soft lovely bodies of the two ladies, causing their eyes to appear a little lost. The both of them appeared unusually enchanting.</p><p>&#x201C;Huh?&#x201D;</p><p>The shut eyes of the black-clothed man were suddenly opened. A shocked expression was present in his eyes, &#x201C;The seal has been broken?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Tribe chief, what is it?&#x201D; An old man with a completely bright-red poisonous snake on his shoulders frowned and asked a question.</p><p>&#x201C;The seal suppressing Yao Ming has been broken&#x2026;&#x201D; The black-clothed man suddenly stood up. His expression was dark and cold as a faint voice was transmitted into the elder&#x2019;s ear.</p><p>&#x201C;What? How is that possible?&#x201D; That elder&#x2019;s face drastically changed after hearing this news. He hurriedly withdrew the emotions on his face as glanced at those Elders and leaders of the various tribes within the large hall. After which, he softly said, &#x201C;You should head over quickly. It will be over for the both of us if Yao Ming manages to escape. I will stabilize the situation here before hurrying over to support you&#x2026;&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Relax, he will not be able to rise again.&#x201D;</p><p>The black-clothed old man sinisterly smiled. After which, his body moved, and he disappeared from the throne.</p><p>&#x201C;Ha ha, there is an Elder who wishes to report something. The tribe chief has gone over to meet him. Everyone, please continue&#x2026;&#x201D; That elder stood up and smiled. He calmed everyone in the large hall when they saw the black-clothed man disappear.</p><p>&#x201C;Clang!&#x201D;</p><p>Xiao Yan broke the final metal chain seal. After which, he dispersed the fire needle. He waved his sleeve and a gentle force supported Yao Ming, who was about to fall. &#x201C;You have only just managed to escape and the Dou Qi within your body is completely exhausted. At this moment, even an expert Dou Zong can kill you.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Ha ha, it is unexpected that I, Yao Ming, can really endure until this day. Young friend, may I know your name?&#x201D; Yao Ming&#x2019;s body was extremely weak. Clearly, he was extremely excited. His eyes landed on Xiao Yan as he laughed.</p><p>&#x201C;Xiao Yan.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Young friend Xiao Yan, I, Yao Ming, will never forget how you have rescued me. As long as I am able to get my revenge, I will use the strength of the entire Nine Serene Deep Ground Python tribe to help fulfill any request you make!&#x201D; Yao Ming&#x2019;s eyes stared intently at Xiao Yan as he spoke in a deep voice.</p><p>Xiao Yan smiled upon hearing this offer. He could sense the extremely dense gratitude in Yao Ming&#x2019;s words. Although this gratitude was a result of his hatred for Yao Xiaotian, this person was not the type who would harm someone who had helped him. Xiao Yan sighed in relief after determining this person&#x2019;s character. He flicked his finger and a medicinal bottle flew toward Yao Ming. He said, &#x201C;Consume some medicinal pills to recover your Dou Qi first. We cannot remain for too long here. Let&#x2019;s quickly leave this Nine Serene Spring. We will go and find trouble with Yao Xiaotian after you regain your strength.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Aye, young friend Xiao Yan is right!&#x201D; Yao Ming nodded and unceremoniously swallowed the bottle of medicinal pills into his stomach. He understood that it was impossible for him to be a match for Yao Xiaotian in his current condition.</p><p>&#x201C;Let&#x2019;s go!&#x201D;</p><p>Xiao Yan waved his sleeve after having rescued Yao Ming. After which, both of them turned into two water arrows that shot up with lightning-like speed.</p><p>Since Xiao Yan had stayed within the Nine Serene Spring for quite a long while, he had exhausted a significant part of the Dou Qi within his body. Hence, he swiftly took out a couple of medicinal pills and stuffed them into his mouth as a precaution while he hurried out of the spring.</p><p>Xiao Yan ended up meeting those endless number of strange snakes on the way back. Fortunately, Yao Ming seemed to possess a method to control them. All of the strange snakes fled into the distance after he emitted a strange sound, and Xiao Yan avoided the trouble of fighting with these strange snakes.</p><p>Xiao Yan and Yao Ming&#x2019;s speed increased significantly in the absence of any obstruction. Within less than ten minutes, he saw some light in the distance and sighed in relief. Xiao Yan waved his sleeve and suddenly sped up.</p><p>&#x201C;We are about to exit!&#x201D;</p><p>Xiao Yan smiled as he traveled closer to the surface of the lake. His body shook as he grabbed Yao Ming. They broke through the surface of the water and landed on the lake.</p><p>&#x201C;Bang!&#x201D;</p><p>A muffled sound was suddenly emitted from the air above after Xiao Yan stabilized his body. A figure fell from the sky as the sharp sound of rushing wind continuously appeared.</p><p>&#x201C;Cai Lin?&#x201D;</p><p>Xiao Yan&#x2019;s expression changed after seeing that figure. He waved his sleeve and a gentle force surged out. This force received her before Xiao Yan grabbed with his hand and pulled Cai Lin beside him.</p><p>&#x201C;You have finally come out.&#x201D; Cai Lin sighed in relief after landing beside Xiao Yan. Her hand hurriedly rubbed away the blood on the corner of her mouth.</p><p>Xiao Yan&#x2019;s eyes became cold after seeing the trace of blood on the corner of Cai Lin&#x2019;s mouth. He did not open his mouth to ask anything. Instead, he slowly lifted his head. There was a black-clothed person suspended in the air. The black-clothes person was looking at Xiao Yan with an unusually dark and vicious pair of eyes.</p><p>&#x201C;This person suddenly arrived and dragged the three of us out. Qing Lin and the Little Fairy Doctor have been wounded by him&#x2026;&#x201D; Cai Lin clenched her teeth as she spoke.</p><p>Xiao Yan looked at a spot a short distance from the spring. Both Qing Lin&#x2019;s and the Little Fairy Doctor&#x2019;s auras were a little chaotic. They had both suffered a serious injury. His eyes became even icy.</p><p>That black-clothed man in the sky looked at Xiao Yan and the skeleton-like Yao Ming with an extremely dense eyes. A vicious smile surfaced on his face.</p><p>&#x201C;Little bastard, since you dare to spoil my plans, this king shall bury you in this spring regardless of where you come from! This king will help you take care of these three beauties. This is the price that you will have to pay for your recklessness!&#x201D;</p>
