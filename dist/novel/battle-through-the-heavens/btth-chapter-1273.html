<p><strong><u>Chapter 1273: Ancient Heaven Serpent</u></strong></p><p>Xiao Yan finally sighed in relief as the gradual disappearance of the brutal feeling within his heart. He hesitated for a moment before his eyes once again carefully turned towards Qing Lin&#x2019;s back. This time, however, he was much more careful. He locked his mind and a purple-brown flame slowly spread from within his body.</p><p>The mysterious tattoo on Qing Lin&#x2019;s smooth back within the faint rise hot fog of the pool also became partially visible. The snake eyes of the nine-headed snake were once again shut. Hence, the kind of unexpected change from earlier did not appear once again.</p><p>Xiao Yan knitted his brows slightly. He focused intently on the mysterious tattoo. The tattoo should be quite big as only a portion of the nine-headed snake&#x2019;s body was revealed above the surface of the water. Clearly, its curled body was still under the water.</p><p>Xiao Yan focused on this mysterious nine-headed snake. His heart felt quite lost. He had never heard of a Magical Beast of such a shape in this current continent. Moreover, from the fierce aura that seemed to spread from this Magical Beast that caused him to be without any defense when he was caught off-guard, it was obvious that this was not an ordinary Magical Beast.</p><p>&#x201C;This thing&#x2026; just what exactly it is?&#x201D;</p><p>Xiao Yan knitted his brows tightly. However, he was still at a loss a moment later. This strange shape&#x2026; even a Nine Serene Deep Ground Python did not look like this, no?</p><p>Xiao Yan could only helplessly shake his head and suppress his doubt within his heart after thinking for a long time in a futile manner. When Qing Lin wakes up, he could ask her. She should be aware of the exact situation.</p><p>This thought flashed across Xiao Yan&#x2019;s heart and he also ceased these futile thoughts. He glanced at the color within the pool and once again took out a small jade bottle from his Storage Ring. He poured out some pale-red liquid from within.</p><p>Attempting to completely remove the Emperor Python Heart Eroding Poison from Qing Lin&#x2019;s body involved quite a complicated process. Fortunately, Xiao Yan was currently considered a true alchemist guru. Should it be someone else, it was likely that the person might really not possess the ability to help Qing Lin remove the poison.</p><p>Although Xiao Yan was clearly aware that attempting to get rid of the Emperor Python Heart Eroding Poison was extremely troublesome and time exhausting, he did not expect that he would spend four days.</p><p>Xiao Yan had remained within the cave during these four days. The number of medicinal ingredients that had been thrown into the pool had numbered to over a couple hundred. A frighteningly pure energy permeated the pool. Finally, even the fog itself became viscous.</p><p>Although time and medicinal ingredients were greatly exhausted, Qing Lin&#x2019;s expression had become increasingly lively under the hot rising energy fog. The slight black vapor that remained between one&#x2019;s brows had also gradually scattered. All of these indicated that the Emperor Python Heart Eroding Poison within her body was swiftly being removed.</p><p>During these few days that Xiao Yan had taken care of the poison removal within Qing Lin&#x2019;s body, Xiao Yan had also paid attention to the mysterious tattoo on her back. After a couple of days&#x2019; of observation, he discovered that there seemed to be an increasing amount of energy being poured into Qing Lin&#x2019;s body. That mysterious nine-headed snake tattoo had also become increasingly clear. Even the snake eyes of the nine heads had slowly opened a little. It was this slight opening of the snake eyes that would cause Xiao Yan to unwittingly sense a trace of violence being spread within his heart. Fortunately, his mental strength was strong and he could ignore the effects of the unusual nine-headed snake.</p><p>After experiencing these changes, Xiao Yan also became increasingly curious towards the mysterious tattoo. This thing ought to be something from the ancient times. However, it was likely that the current Dou Qi continent no longer had such a Magical Beast. Otherwise, Xiao Yan would definitely have at least heard something about it.</p><p>While Xiao Yan was curious, he also understood that the most important thing was to resolve the poison within Qing Lin&#x2019;s body first. Hence, he calmed his heart and continued to wait. This kind of bitter care continued for three days more before those eyes of Qing Lin, which had been shut for seven days, finally showed some activity.</p><p>&#x201C;Blub blub&#x2026;&#x201D;</p><p>The faint red pool water continued to emit water bubbles within the pool. Hot air rose and one could vaguely see a lovely graceful figure. During these ten years, the little girl from back then had already become a vibrant and alluring person&#x2026;</p><p>Xiao Yan sat on a rock beside the pool. His shut eyes were also slowly opened. He could sense that a slight unusual activity had appeared within the pool at this moment.</p><p>&#x201C;Is it about to complete&#x2026;&#x201D;</p><p>Xiao Yan softly muttered to himself. He suddenly heard a splashing water sound being emitted from the pool. Immediately, he became stunned and was just about to stand up when the entire gave suddenly shook intensely.</p><p>&#x201C;What happened?&#x201D;</p><p>Xiao Yan&#x2019;s expression changed slightly. He hurriedly stood up and his eyes paused on the pool that was covered by fog. The activity was emitted from that spot.</p><p>Xiao Yan narrowed his eyes. He stared intently at the interior of the pool. There seemed to be an enormous outline that was vaguely visible within the fog&#x2026;</p><p>Xiao Yan frowned slightly as he sensed this kind of unusual change. The Dou Qi within his body was circulated rapidly.</p><p>The spreading energy fog suddenly wiggled when the Dou Qi was being circulated within Xiao Yan&#x2019;s body. Immediately, a head sized strange eye appeared out of nowhere. Three small dots were enlarged within the eye that was filled with green light. Finally, they transformed into three demonic like emerald flowers that surrounded the eyes and rotated rapidly.</p><p>&#x201C;Triple Jade-Green Snake Flower Pupils!&#x201D;</p><p>Xiao Yan&#x2019;s heart tightened immediately upon seeing the appearance of the demonic eye. His body suddenly rushed backward in a reflex-like action.</p><p>&#x201C;Puff!&#x201D;</p><p>Xiao Yan&#x2019;s body had just pulled back when that demonic eye suddenly exploded. An enormous figure rushed out from within the pool. It pounced towards Xiao Yan with lightning-like speed.</p><p>Xiao Yan immediately inhaled a breath of cold air as he looked at the enormous figure that pounced over. It was an enormous snake that possessed nine savage snake heads. The body of the snake head was dark red in color. It was just like fresh blood that had been sedimented for a countless number of years. At a glance, a ferocious aura that was difficult to describe spread out from it.</p><p>The enormous snake shook its nine ferocious heads. The eighteen demonic eyes of the snake head had actually become blood red in color at this moment. Moreover, the most mysterious thing was that the interior of these blood red eyes was actually the same as the Triple Jade-Green Snake Flower Pupils that Qing Lin used.</p><p>Xiao Yan focused intently on the nine-headed snake that charged over explosively towards him. His eyes flicked. A moment later, he suddenly cried out sternly when the snake was about to pounce onto his body, &#x201C;Qing Lin!&#x201D;</p><p>This cry of Xiao Yan was accompanied by Dou Qi. It was just like a thunder that exploded within the cave, causing the cave to shake violently.</p><p>The enormous body of the nine headed snake also trembled under this cry. A struggling expression suddenly surfaced within its blood red eyes. A moment later, the blood redness actually rapidly faded. An emerald green color slowly recovered.</p><p>&#x201C;Chi!&#x201D;</p><p>Following the appearance of that jade green color, the enormous body of the nine head snake suddenly erupted into a wave of powerful glow. Its body also shrunk rapidly. Immediately, it transformed into a small body that violently fell from the midair.</p><p>Xiao Yan&#x2019;s body flashed when he saw Qing Lin&#x2019;s body falling. He grabbed the tiny waist of Qing Lin. That soft boneless feeling caused his heart to fluctuate a little. He hurriedly calmed his mind before looking at Qing Lin, who was awakening in a lost manner, and said, &#x201C;Are you alright?&#x201D;</p><p>Qing Lin, who was slowly opening her eyes, looked at Xiao Yan, who was within close proximity. She was initially startled. The feeling that was transmitted from her body caused her face to redden with a thump sound. She hurriedly escaped from Xiao Yan&#x2019;s hand and hid behind a stone pillar with a flash.</p><p>Xiao Yan involuntarily rubbed his nose when he heard the shuffling sound that was emitted from behind the stone pillar. He felt a little embarrassed.</p><p>Only after Qing Lin wore her clothes did she walk out from behind the stone pillar with a reddened face. Xiao Yan coughed dryly when he saw her fiery red earlobes. He hurriedly asked with a serious expression, &#x201C;What happened back then? That thing&#x2026;&#x201D;</p><p>Qing Lin was startled when she heard this, Immediately, she crossed her small hands together and spoke timidly, &#x201C;That is the soul of the Ancient Heaven Serpent.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Ancient Heaven Serpent?&#x201D;</p><p>Xiao Yan was stunned. He had heard of the Ancient Heaven Serpent. It was rumored that this was one of the ancient snake Magical Beast ancestors. It possessed the ability to destroy the world. It was rumored that it was a Magical Beast that could be considered on the same level as the Ancient Heaven Phoenix. However, the number of this Ancient Heaven Serpent was smaller than even the Heaven Phoenix. Hence, it had been extinct since the ancient times. There was even less need to mention about it now.</p><p>&#x201C;That is not right&#x2026; I remember that the ancient books do not mention that this Ancient Heaven Serpent possesses nine heads&#x2026;&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;This is a mutated Ancient Heaven Serpent. I am also unaware of why it is like this. When I have arrived at the Central Plains back then, I had accidentally entered an ancient mountain range and found the skeleton of an Ancient Heaven Serpent. In my curiosity, I end up using the Triple Jade-Green Snake Flower Pupils. How could I expect that I would actually summon a spiritual body&#x2026;&#x201D; Qing Lin&#x2019;s small face was bitter as she said, &#x201C;It is very difficult to tame this thing. It does not listen to me even though I have used the Triple Jade-Green Snake Flower Pupils. At times, it will come out and cause trouble. Fortunately, with the increase in my strength, the resistance of this thing is also becoming increasingly weak. It is likely that I will easily be able to control it very soon&#x2026;&#x201D;</p><p>Xiao Yan&#x2019;s face was stunned. Controlling a mutated Ancient Heaven Serpent? This thing&#x2026; it was an existence that was comparable to the Ancient Heaven Phoenix. Should it grow in the future, it would even be able to fight against an elite Dou Sheng.</p><p>&#x201C;Didn&#x2019;t you say that your Triple Jade-Green Snake Flower Pupils is unable to control those snake form Magical Beasts that possess an ancient bloodline?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;If this Ancient Heaven Serpent possessed a body, I will indeed be unable to control it. However, this fellow is merely a spirit. Moreover, it is not that I have taken the initiative to control it. Instead, it wishes to stay on me&#x2026;&#x201D; Qing Lin spoke helplessly. &#x201C;There are only two types of top-tier snake form Magical Beast that truly possess a royal bloodline during the ancient times. One is the Ancient Heaven Serpent while the other is the Heaven Swallowing Python. The current Nine Serene Deep Ground Python is merely their descendants.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Heaven Swallowing Python?&#x201D;</p><p>Xiao Yan lifted his eyebrows almost immediately when he heard this name. He seemed to remember that after Cai Lin&#x2019;s evolution, she appeared to be a Seven Coloured Heaven Swallowing Python?</p><p>&#x201C;The poison within your body should have been resolved right?&#x201D; Xiao Yan shook his head, glanced at Qing Lin and asked.</p><p>Qing Lin nodded. She smilingly said, &#x201C;Currently, my strength has also reached that of a one star Dou Zun. If I use the Triple Jade-Green Snake Flower Pupils, it is likely that I would be able to control a snake form Magical Beast that has reached the strength of a four-star Dou Zun.&#x201D;</p><p>Xiao Yan involuntarily shook his head helplessly when he heard this. This girl&#x2019;s Triple Jade-Green Snake Flower Pupils was indeed too frightening. Even without mentioning its ability to control snake form Magical Beast, just smoothly controlling that Ancient Heaven Serpent&#x2019;s spirit alone in the future would definitely greatly strengthen her fighting strength.</p><p>&#x201C;Since the poison has been resolved, let&#x2019;s leave&#x2026;&#x201D;</p><p>Xiao Yan waved his hand. He turned his body and walked towards the exit of the cave. Since Qing Lin&#x2019;s problem was resolved, it should be time to begin refining a body for Yao Lao&#x2026;</p>
