<p><strong><u>Chapter 1210: Fungus Green Pill</u></strong></p><p>After chatting with the three great heads a little longer, Xiao Yan&#x2019;s group finally bid them farewell and returned to their room.</p><p>&#x201C;Has anything happened during this period of time?&#x201D; Xiao Yan randomly asked after having entered the room.</p><p>&#x201C;Due to the Ye clan having many matters to deal with, Ye Zong could only return to Ye City with Xin Lan in disappointment after waiting hopelessly for a long time.&#x201D; The Little Fairy Doctor politely informed him.</p><p>&#x201C;Yes.&#x201D; Xiao Yan slightly nodded. The current Ye clan was in a bad state. Being the First Elder if the clan, Ye Zhong was unable to wait around Holy Pill City. Being able to wait for about half a year was enough to let Xiao Yan know Ye Zhong was sincere.</p><p>&#x201C;Additionally, people from the Profound Xuan Sect came to find trouble once during this period of time. Their so-called junior sect leader and two Elders went missing within the Pill Realm together. It is likely that they had met with some mishap. They think that you are the one responsible. Hence, they would frequently come to find trouble. However, Cao Ying was a witness and said that the one who had killed the people from the Profound Xuan Sect was Old Mu Gu. Adding in Pill Tower&#x2019;s mediation, the other party unwillingly left.&#x201D; The Little Fairy Doctor slightly frowned and said. &#x201C;However, from the way I see it, they still hate you. If they were to obtain news that you left the Star Region in one piece, they will definitely come and find trouble.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;What a bunch of stubborn people.&#x201D;</p><p>Xiao Yan knit his eyebrows. He immediately waved his hand and said, &#x201C;Just leave them be. If they really come looking for trouble, there is no need for us to be polite. These people are not good people either.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Yes.&#x201D;</p><p>Xiao Yan sat in a chair. His eyes swept over the Little Fairy Doctor&#x2019;s lovely body and surprise flashed within them. He said, &#x201C;Your aura seems to have also become much stronger during this period of time.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;The Poison Dan in my body possesses a miraculous effect to my training. I have improved quite significantly during this one year&#x2019;s time.&#x201D; The Little Fairy Doctor curled her mouth into a smile as she replied.</p><p>&#x201C;What significantly. Ugh, your current strength has likely reached the peak of a three star Dou Zun. With this training speed, it is likely that very few people within the Dou Zun class can compete with you. A completely controlled Woeful Poison Body is indeed terrifying&#x2026;&#x201D; Tian Huo zun-zhe by her side bitterly laughed. His tone was also quite complicated. His strength had also advanced a little during this period of time. However, it was far inferior when compared to the Little Fairy Doctor&#x2019;s increase.</p><p>&#x201C;Peak of the three star Dou Zun huh&#x2026;&#x201D; surprise flashed across Xiao Yan&#x2019;s face. If the current Little Fairy Doctor&#x2019;s Woeful Poison Body were to completely erupt, it was likely that she could even fight against the valley chief of the Ice River Valley. This Woeful Poison Body was indeed mysterious.</p><p>&#x201C;Old Mister Yao need not belittle yourself. You have stabilized yourself at the peak of a one star Dou Zun within a short year. Breaking through to a two star Dou Zun or even recovering to your previous peak is merely a matter of time.&#x201D; The Little Fairy Doctor smiled as she responded.</p><p>&#x201C;Difficult. Being able to recover to the strength of a Dou Zun has already exceeded my expectations. I was merely at the level of a five star Dou Zun back at my peak&#x2026;&#x201D; Tian Huo zun-zhe bitterly laughed. He naturally understood just how difficult it was for him to recover to his peak. Every level within the Dou Zun class was unusually difficult to advance to. Spending decades or even centuries was not a rare occurrence. This reason was why he felt shocked and envious at the Little Fairy Doctor&#x2019;s training speed.</p><p>&#x201C;That may not be certain&#x2026;&#x201D; Xiao Yan&#x2019;s finger gently knocked on the table. He mused for a moment before slowly saying, &#x201C;One will indeed need quite a long time to return to one&#x2019;s peak through normal training. However, other methods can drastically reduce this period of time.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;You mean&#x2026; relying on medicinal pills?&#x201D;</p><p>Tian Huo zun-zhe&#x2019;s shriveled hand tightened around the teacup he was holding. His bitterly smiling face had a fiery heat flashing over it. At his level, only medicinal pills that had reached the eighth tier could aid him&#x2026;</p><p>&#x201C;May I know if old mister Yao has ever heard of a medicinal pill called the &#x2018;Fungus Green Pill&#x2019;?&#x201D; Xiao Yan smiled and asked.</p><p>&#x201C;Fungus Green Pill?&#x201D; Tian Huo zun-zhe was startled. The fiery heat within his eyes surged. An excited expression also flashed across his face. &#x201C;The Fungus Green Pill rumored to be able to allow one whose strength has deteriorated to return to one&#x2019;s peak?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Ke ke, the Fungus Green Pill does indeed have some use. However, it cannot allow you to return to your peak strength as you have described. That is merely a rumor. Based on my estimates, if old mister Yao consumes this medicinal pill, you should be able to recover to the three star Dou Zun level.&#x201D; Xiao Yan smiled and shook his head as he cleared up some myths.</p><p>&#x201C;Three star&#x2026; that is also sufficient.&#x201D; Tian Huo zun-zhe was not disappointed. Being able to leap from one star to three stars was also an extremely swift improvement.</p><p>&#x201C;However&#x2026; this Fungus Green Pill is a tier 8 medicinal pill. It is extremely troublesome to refine. Even an ordinary tier 8 alchemist guru would find it difficult to successfully refine&#x2026;&#x201D;</p><p>Xiao Yan involuntarily smiled and continued after seeing Tian Huo zun-zhe&#x2019;s hesitant expression, &#x201C;Leave this matter to me. Old mister Yao has helped me plenty. Now, I should reimburse you a little.&#x201D;</p><p>No matter how one put it, Tian Huo zun-zhe had indeed been Xiao Yan&#x2019;s a good assistant during this period. They had made an agreement in the past that as long as Xiao Yan helped refine a body that could accommodate Tian Huo zun-zhe&#x2019;s soul, he would become Xiao Yan&#x2019;s guard for a year. Currently, one year&#x2019;s time was already up. Xiao Yan would naturally need to help him out a little more if Xiao Yan wanted the other party to stay.</p><p>Moreover, he would likely have to head to the Hall of Souls to rescue Yao Lao very soon. At that time, it was naturally best for his lineup to be as strong as possible. By helping Tian Huo zun-zhe raise his strength, it would raise their chances of success.</p><p>&#x201C;This&#x2026; ugh, saying thanks does not do such a big favor justice. The old me will remember this favor in my heart.&#x201D;</p><p>Tian Huo zun-zhe widened his mouth. His courteous words circulated in his mouth before being swallowed into his stomach. He nodded and uttered those words in a deep voice.</p><p>&#x201C;Ke ke, once I have rested a couple more days, I will try to help old mister Yao refine a Fungus Green Pill before the Pill Tower manages to obtain any information&#x2026;&#x201D; Xiao Yan grinned. He stood up and walked to his room. He said, &#x201C;It is already quite late. All of you should rest early. Inform me if the Pill Tower has any news. I might undertake a retreat for a couple of days.&#x201D;</p><p>The Little Fairy Doctor and the other two nodded when they heard his commands. Only Zi Yan muttered some dissatisfied words related to a retreat within her mouth.</p><p>&#x2026;&#x2026;&#x2026;&#x2026;</p><p>Xiao Yan sat on the bed within a room lit with a warm light. He clenched his hand and a scroll appeared in his hand. It was the remaining three seals of the God Seal Skill that Xun Er had given to him before she left.</p><p>Xiao Yan&#x2019;s heart was clearly aware of the might of the God Seal Skill, a full set of Di class high level Dou Techniques. Even if one were to split every seal within it, it would definitely still be stronger than ordinary Di class high level Dou Techniques. If the five seals were to stack on each other, its might would be comparable to a Tian class Dou Technique. By being able to become one of the ultimate skills of the Gu clan, it definitely did not possess an empty name.</p><p>The God Seal Skill was divided into five seals. However, Xiao Yan had only learned the first two seals. In the past, the might of the first two seals had been enough for him. However, as the experts he came into contact with became stronger, the Open Mountain Seal and the Sea Flipping Seal were gradually becoming clumsy. Hence, before he made the trip to rescue Yao Lao, Xiao Yan needed to learn the remaining God Seal Skills. At that time, he would have gained some additional tactics.</p><p>The scroll that Xun Er had left behind recorded the training methods for the last three seals, the Overturning Land Seal, Sky Burying Seal, and the Ancient God Seal. With Xiao Yan&#x2019;s current strength, it was more than sufficient for him to practice the Overturning Land Seal while it would be a little strenuous for him to practice the Sky Burying Seal. He would be helpless to practice the final Ancient God Seal. Based on what was recorded on the scroll, seldom anyone managed to successfully master the last Ancient God Seal even within the Gu clan. From this, one could tell just how difficult it was to practice this thing.</p><p>However, Xiao Yan was not greedy. He understood that one could not gain everything in one go. Being able to successfully learn the Overturning Land Seal and the Sky Burying Seal was already enough to greatly strengthen his combat strength.</p><p>Xiao Yan made up his mind within his heart. He did not delay any longer as he remembered all the information within the scroll in his mind. After which, he slowly shut his eyes and began to form some unfamiliar and complicated hand seals in front of him.</p><p>The level of the God Seal Skill was quite high. It could also be considered one of the profound Dou Techniques within the Gu clan. The difficulty in practicing it was quite great. Fortunately, Xiao Yan could no longer be considered a novice. He possessed the experience from practicing the first two seals. At this moment, he might not be able to successfully master the seals, but they would become familiar more quickly.</p><p>A young man sat cross-legged within a quiet room. His hands continued to switch between numerous dazzling hand seals. While the hand seals changed, threads of strange ripples quietly spread from them&#x2026;</p><p>Five days swiftly passed while Xiao Yan was practicing the God Seal Skill. During this period of time, Xiao Yan had used the Overturning Land Seal and the Sky Burying Seal countless numbers of times. During this training where he forgot to eat and rest as well as Xiao Yan&#x2019;s past experience, he gradually became familiar with the Overturning Land Seal. He also got a glimpse at the Sky Burying Seal. Based on this speed, it was likely only a matter of time before Xiao Yan mastered them.</p><p>This tireless training by Xiao Yan continued for seven days. However, it was suddenly broken by the Little Fairy Doctor. Just when he was rejoicing because he thought that the Pill Tower had managed to obtain news about Yao Lao, the Little Fairy Doctor informed him that trouble had come knocking on his door.</p><p>Xiao Yan was startled when he heard the Little Fairy Doctor&#x2019;s words. A dark chill immediately flashed across his eyes.</p><p>&#x201C;Profound Xuan Sect?&#x201D;</p><p>The Little Fairy Doctor slightly nodded. She softly said, &#x201C;Moreover, quite a number of people have come. This time around, it looks like the chief of the Profound Xuan Sect wants to take your life for his son&#x2019;s life.&#x201D;</p><p>Xiao Yan was expressionless. He got down from the bed and faintly said, &#x201C;In that case, let&#x2019;s just see if he is qualified&#x2026;&#x201D;</p><p>Xiao Yan took the lead to walk out of the room after his voice sounded. The other party had stepped over their heads. If they were to choose to hide and not meet them, it was likely that the name of the Pill Gathering champion would really become a joke.</p>
