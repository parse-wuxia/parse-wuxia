<p><strong><u>Chapter 423: Xun Er&#x2019;s Strength</u></strong></p><p>As the three of them reached an agreement, Wu Hao and Hu Jia waved their hands. Both of them brought each of their four remaining competitors as they slowly walked in the direction which Xiao Yan and Xun Er were at.</p><p>A dark coldness swept through Bai Shan&#x2019;s eyes when he saw the actions of the two of them. He turned around and viciously stared at Xiao Yan, who had his eyes closed. After which, his gaze once again stopped at the young lady, who was standing prettily in front of Xiao Yan, some intoxication surface on his face. He clenched his fist tightly and softly muttered, &#x201C;You are mine!&#x201D;</p><p>Bai Shan grasped the handle of his lance and strode toward where Xiao Yan and Xun Er were at.</p><p>The movement of everyone in the arena did not escape Xun Er&#x2019;s notice. When she saw the three groups actually choosing to come over at the same time, she appeared to have understood something. For the first time, a faint coldness appeared on her elegant and exquisite face. She waved her sleeves gently and golden-colored Dou Qi swiftly surged forth. A force that was not weaker than a seven star Da Dou Shi erupted explosively from Xun Er&#x2019;s body without being held back. The golden-colored Dou Qi agglomerated into two clusters of golden light in her palms, much like small suns, appearing attractive to people&#x2019;s eyes.</p><p>&#x201C;What? Do you want to combine forces and attack together?&#x201D; Xun Er watched the eleven people, who were coming closer as she asked faintly.</p><p>&#x201C;Hee hee, Xun Er, relax, we will not hurt you. It is just that I must get rid of that fellow.&#x201D; Hu Jia pointed at the closed eyed Xiao Yan as she spoke with a smile.</p><p>&#x201C;You can come and try.&#x201D; Xun Er replied in an ice cold manner. At the same time, the two clusters of intense golden light in her palms became more and more eye-piercing. Bai Shan, Hu Jia, Wu Hao and another eight competitors, who were at the peak of the Dou Shi class, this line-up was sufficient to cause her to feel extremely troubled to deal with. Moreover, she still needed to pay attention to Xiao Yan in order to protect him.</p><p>&#x201C;Ah, Xun Er, don&#x2019;t you understand my feelings toward you? What is so good about these stinky men?&#x201D; Hu Jia&#x2019;s watery pupils, which contained a cunningness, stared at Xun Er in a pitiful manner. Her warm voice caused the expression of Bai Shan by her side to appear a little unnatural. Was it not better to allow him to be the one who said these words?</p><p>Xun Er shook her head and ignored Hu Jia. She took a step back and placed Xiao Yan behind her, using her actions to announce her intent to Hu Jia and the others.</p><p>&#x201C;Junior Xun Er, it is just as Hu Jia has said. We will not harm you. We only want you to not interfere with us.&#x201D; Bai Shan smiled as he spoke to Xun Er.</p><p>Xun Er coldly looked at him. This time around, she was too lazy to even talk to him. She did not feel how abominable this fellow was in the past. During these short few days, however, Xun Er&#x2019;s hatred for Bai Shan had reached the extreme.</p><p>The ice cold gaze of Xun Er once again caused Bai Shan to tremble slightly. He inhaled a deep breath of air and tried his best to force a smiling face. He then spoke to Hu Jia and Wu Hao, &#x201C;Let&#x2019;s act. We cannot delay any longer. Otherwise, Xiao Yan will successfully advance.&#x201D;</p><p>Hu Jia and Wu Hao nodded their heads when they heard Bai Shan&#x2019;s urging. Dou Qi slowly surged out of their bodies, and in an instant, the arena was divided and occupied by a few strong forces.</p><p>The change that occurred in the arena similarly caused a wave to rise in the viewing gallery. From the looks of the actions of Bai Shan and the others it was clear that they wanted to fight three against one. This kind of method, where a larger group bullied the smaller one, caused waves of uproars to sound from the viewing gallery. However, when these people recalled that this competition method did not lean toward absolute fairness, they could only helplessly shrink back.</p><p>&#x201C;Aren&#x2019;t these fellows too despicable? To actually fight three against one?&#x201D; Xiao Yu&#x2019;s face could not help but flush as she cried out angrily when she saw the situation in the arena, which had reached the point where Xun Er was surrounded.</p><p>&#x201C;Ah, the rules of this competition this time around did not disallow using such a method. Therefore, we can&#x2019;t do anything about it.&#x201D; Instructor Ruo Ling sighed gently. The phalanx of her finger under her sleeves had turned slightly white because she had clenched her fist too tightly, &#x201C;Hopefully, Xun Er can hold out for ten minutes. As long as Xiao Yan completes his advancement, everything will be fine.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Hu Gan, looks like this attempt of yours has too many loopholes. Even something like three against one can actually appear.&#x201D; Old Huo frowned slightly as he faintly spoke, while looking into the arena. There was some ridicule within his voice.</p><p>At this moment, Hu Gan&#x2019;s expression was a little ugly. He could only laugh bitterly when he heard these words of Old Huo before sighing, &#x201C;This kind of competition is indeed very chaotic. I have already said at the beginning of the competition that they are not breaking the rules by doing this. You should not think that I have chosen to turn a blind eye to this because Hu Jia is participating. That was her own decision and I will not interfere even a little. Similarly, if she fails or some other thing happens, I will also not interfere. All of these are issues that belong to them, the young people. I will definitely not interfere.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Hopefully.&#x201D; Old Huo nodded and spoke faintly as he once again threw his gaze into the arena.</p><p>Under a countless number of gazes, the encirclement in the arena finally locked onto Xun Er. Eight participants, who were at the peak of the Dou Shi class, were the first to attack. The eight figures directly carried a fierce force as they shot toward Xiao Yan behind Xun Er.</p><p>&#x201C;Guardian Trigram Palm!&#x201D;</p><p>Xun Er&#x2019;s pretty face became cold. The golden glow within her body surged and her legs actually left the ground by a distance of half an inch. Her long hair, which extended down her back to her waist, moved automatically without wind. The golden glow in her palm surged and eight palms struck out in succession. One could see the afterimages of the eight palms pausing in midair before they immediately left a golden-colored energy trail as they shot out in a lightning-like manner. Finally, they heavily imprinted themselves into the chests of the eight competitors, who could not dodge in time. In an instant, the eight of them vomited a mouthful of fresh blood and were directly knocked out of the competition arena by this one strike of Xun Er&#x2019;s, under a countless number of stunned gazes.</p><p>&#x201C;So strong&#x2026;&#x201D; One move and she settled eight people at the peak of the Dou Shi class. Numerous people in the viewing gallery inhaled a deep breath of cool air. Within Jia Nan Academy, Xun Er had seldom used her true strength. Currently, because of Xiao Yan&#x2019;s matter, the actions of Bai Shan and the others had clearly enraged her, touching her bottom line. Finally, she ceased holding back. Therefore, she used such a powerful strike when she attacked!</p><p>The golden glow in front of them had just disappeared when a bloody aura suddenly pounced over. A blood-colored human figure flashed in a bizarre manner as it advanced. As Wu Hao waved his hand, he carried a blood-colored fog and attacked Xun Er.</p><p>&#x201C;Bang, bang, bang!&#x201D;</p><p>Xun Er&#x2019;s expression did not fluctuate in the slightest when faced with Wu Hao&#x2019;s frontal attack. Her hands, which were shrouded by a golden light, chose to meet the attack head on and collided with Wu Hao. Each time their hands struck against each other, an ear-piercing energy explosion would appear.</p><p>Only after they exchanged nearly ten blows did Xun Er&#x2019;s lovely figure sway slightly and took half a step back. On the other hand, Wu Hao took a full three steps back.</p><p>Wu Hao had just stepped back, when the figure of a whip, carrying a thundering noise, fell from the sky. Xun Er turned her hand and raised it. A golden glow shot out explosively and knocked away the long whip which Hu Jia had lashed over. At the same time, Xun Er&#x2019;s toes suddenly pulled her body back as she gave a violent kick behind, pushing back Bai Shan, who had wanted to make a detour to launch a sneak attack on Xiao Yan from behind.</p><p>Within less than two minutes, Xun Er used her own strength to defeat eight people at the peak of the Dou Shi class and forced back Bai Shan, Hu Jia, and Wu Hao, whose strength were not far from hers. Although this was because the three of them did not really use their trump cards, her skill was still really shocking.</p><p>After the first exchange, Bai Shan, Hu Jia, and Wu Hao also had a rough outline of Xun Er&#x2019;s strength. Some seriousness immediately surfaced on their faces. They exchanged glances with one another and the Dou Qi within the three of them began to surge simultaneously. Immediately, the three figures launched their fiercest attacks toward Xun Er at the same time.</p><p>One could only see human figures flashing as they heard the loud noises erupting from the collision of Dou Qi and watched energy ripples form within the arena. Bai Shan and the two others used all their tactics with the intention of attacking Xiao Yan, while Xun Er was like an enormous mountain that blocked the three of them. Any attack that was shot toward Xiao Yan would be accurately blocked by her. That intuition, which was nearly abnormal, gave Bai Shan and the two others an extremely great headache.</p><p>&#x201C;Bang!&#x201D;</p><p>Xun Er&#x2019;s two hands once again collided with Bai Shan&#x2019;s and Hu Jia&#x2019;s attack. The three of them took a few short steps back. Xun Er had just pulled back to defend Xiao Yan when she suddenly sensed a bloody aura flowing from her right. When she turned around to take a look, she realized that Wu Hao had actually taken advantage of the time when she was fighting with Bai Shan and Hu Jia to approach Xiao Yan without her knowing.</p><p>A fury flashed across Xun Er&#x2019;s face as she watched Wu Hao approaching Xiao Yan. Her toes pressed gently against the ground and her body instantly appeared in front of Wu Hao. The golden glow on her right palm surged and it immediately carried a powerful force to slam ferociously at Wu Hao&#x2019;s chest.</p><p>This attack of Xun Er was something that even Wu Hao did not dare to slight. He immediately and hurriedly met the blow with a palm which was shrouded by a bloody aura.</p><p>&#x201C;Bang!&#x201D; The two palms smashed together and the rock surface under Wu Hao&#x2019;s feet was shattered into powder.</p><p>&#x201C;Chi!&#x201D; Xun Er had just exchanged blows with Wu Hao, when rushing wind appeared behind her. Her eyebrows were slightly knit together. Her right hand carried a ferocious golden glow as she thrust it over.</p><p>&#x201C;Bang!&#x201D; The glowing golden palm, which she had just shot over, was blocked by Hu Jia. In the arena, Xun Er actually relied on just herself to handle two strong opponents without showing any signs of being defeated. This kind of strength could be called terrifying.</p><p>&#x201C;Hei, Junior Xun Er, I&#x2019;m sorry. This fellow must be kicked out of the arena today.&#x201D; Just as Xun Er was tied up by Hu Jia and Wu Hao, a cold laugh suddenly rang out from behind her. She hurriedly turned her head behind, only to see that Bai Shan was using a leg to viciously kick at the closed eyed Xiao Yan.</p><p>&#x201C;Bai Shan, you dare!&#x201D; An ice cold killing intent flashed across her face for the first time in all these years. The golden glow surged explosively from Xun Er&#x2019;s body. She shook both her hands and actually managed to force both Wu Hao and Hu Jia back with just her own strength. Her body immediately flashed and she appeared in front of Xiao Yan. She extended her arms and hugged Xiao Yan into her chest. However, by doing so, she coincidentally exposed her back to Bai Shan. That leg of his was heavily swung at her shoulder. Immediately, Xun Er&#x2019;s face became slightly red as a faint blood trace surfaced at the corner of her mouth, which she swiftly wiped away.</p><p>&#x201C;Bai Shan! You dare to hurt her!&#x201D; When he saw a blood trace that flashed and disappeared from the corner of Xun Er&#x2019;s mouth, Wu Hao, who was extremely sensitive toward fresh blood, could not help but become furious as he turned his body and shouted angrily at Bai Shan. Some fury was also present on Hu Jia&#x2019;s pretty face by his side.</p><p>&#x201C;I only wanted to get Xiao Yan out of the arena. It is Junior Xun Er who got herself injured in order to protect him. How can you blame me?&#x201D; Bai Shan coldly shouted.</p><p>&#x201C;You don&#x2019;t need to continue to be a hypocrite. Bai Shan, if you are able to leave the competition ground unscathed, I, Xiao Xun Er, will no longer need to continue staying at Jia Nan Academy.&#x201D; An ice cold voice was suddenly emitted from Xun Er&#x2019;s mouth. She slowly stood up. Her autumn water eyes were suddenly, yet gradually, covered by a golden glow. Following the appearance of the golden glow in her eyes, an extremely powerful energy radiated out from Xun Er&#x2019;s body. Her long hair, which extended to her waist, had also begun to grow longer with the increase of energy. From her appearance, it seemed that she was activating a certain Secret Technique.</p><p>However, just as Xun Er&#x2019;s growing long hair was about to extend across her buttocks, a white hand suddenly extended out from behind her. It immediately grabbed onto Xun Er&#x2019;s arm and that familiar faint voice caused Xun Er&#x2019;s wildly growing black hair to swiftly shrink. It also caused a smile to surface on her ice cold face.</p><p>&#x201C;Alright, let me handle the rest.&#x201D;</p>
