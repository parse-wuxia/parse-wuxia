<p><strong><u>Chapter 289: Liu Ling</u></strong></p><p>In the spacious room, Xiao Yan was frowning slightly as he eyed the spot where his finger touched Nalan Jie&#x2019;s back. With his previous experience, he could clearly sense the flame was doped with some unknown things which were in turn absorbed into his body the instant the green colored flame was withdrawn.</p><p>&#x201C;A mutation of the &#x2018;Searing Poison&#x2019; is indeed scary. Even with my current flame controlling ability, I am unable to completely incinerate it. Ugh, it is likely that only Yao Lao&#x2019;s &#x2018;Bone Chilling Flame&#x2019; can completely remove it.&#x201D; Xiao Yan slowly removed his finger, shook his head and sighed softly in his heart.</p><p>&#x201C;We will stop here for this poison removing session. After a couple more times, I think that the poison in your body will be completely removed.&#x201D; Xiao Yan retracted his finger into his sleeves, then eyed Nalan Jie, whose expression was much improved since the last time, and said.</p><p>&#x201C;Thank you very much Little Brother Yan Xiao. I am able to sense that the &#x2018;Searing Poison&#x2019; in my body is gradually decreasing.&#x201D; Nalan Jie wiped off the perspiration on his forehead. The intense pain each time the poison was expelled was very exhausting, similar to him having gone through a battle with a strong person of the same class. He turned his head around and thanked Xiao Yan, whose face showed slight exhaustion.</p><p>&#x201C;It is just that each of us are holding what the other requires.&#x201D; Xiao Yan indifferently shook his head. His mind scanned the interior of his body a couple of times. He knit his eyebrows even deeper as he realized that the &#x2018;Searing Poison&#x2019; appeared to have become even more dense in his body after this poison removing session.</p><p>&#x201C;Ah&#x2026; this thing. I wonder if it is a blessing or trouble. It would be good if Teacher was here. With the experience of his elderly self, I would not need to blindly worry about such matters&#x2026;&#x201D; Xiao Yan softly sighed and could only speak with a bitter smile in his heart.</p><p>&#x201C;Haha, Little Brother Yan Xiao. It must have been hard on you for these past two days. If you need any medicinal ingredients or other things, you can tell us. These are all small matters. Just let our Nalan clan go and settle it. You just need to rest.&#x201D; Seeing Nalan Jie&#x2019;s increasingly ruddy complexion, the smile on Nalan Su&#x2019;s face also increased. He took two steps forward and said with the smile still on his face to Xiao Yan.</p><p>Hearing this, Xiao Yan hesitated for a moment. He conveniently took out a paper and pen from the storage ring. After which, he swiftly wrote some rare and precious medicinal ingredients that were rarely seen in the market. After which, he handed it over to Nalan Su. Since the other party was a big fat sheep, it would be a waste not to slaughter. In any case, with the financial strength of the Nalan clan, this little bit was an insufficient amount that wouldn&#x2019;t even make their hearts ache.</p><p>TL: Fat sheep = lot of resources, Slaughter = take a generous cut</p><p>Nalan Su received the paper and took a glance at it. His expression did not have the slightest change because of the valuable medicinal ingredients on it. He called out and got a female servant to follow what was written on it and take them out from the clan&#x2019;s warehouse. During the whole process, Nalan Su&#x2019;s response did not have the slightest hesitation, acting in an ostentatious manner.</p><p>&#x201C;Haha, Little Brother Yan Xiao, why don&#x2019;t we go to the living room to take a seat first. The things that you need will immediately be brought over.&#x201D; Seeing that the female servant had exited from the room, Nalan Jie, who had finished wearing his clothes, smiled and said to Xiao Yan.</p><p>&#x201C;Okay.&#x201D; Xiao Yan nodded slightly and lifted his leg to follow Nalan Jie and Nalan Su in front of him.</p><p>After exiting the door, they passed through a quiet corridor before the three of them walked into the luxurious living room. They had just taken their seats when the female servant at the side hurriedly served them fragrant tea. After which, she bowed her body and stepped back.</p><p>&#x201C;Little Brother Yan Xiao, I assume that the purpose of you coming to the capital this time around would be to participate in the Alchemist Grand Meeting, right?&#x201D; Nalan Jie lifted his teacup, took a slow sip and asked with a smile.</p><p>&#x201C;Yes.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Ke ke, all the mighty people have gathered for this Grand Meeting. It seems that there will be a good show to watch.&#x201D; Nalan Su seated by his side smiled and said.</p><p>&#x201C;I am only here to join the fun and don&#x2019;t have much ability to compete with the others.&#x201D; Xiao Yan smiled and replied.</p><p>&#x201C;You are really modest. Possessing something as unique as a &#x2018;Heavenly Flame&#x2019;, it would be impossible for you not to display your splendor.&#x201D; Nalan Jie shook his head and immediately laughed, &#x201C;Before the Grand Meeting, there is definitely a need for some practice. If Little Brother Yan Xiao needs any medicinal ingredients, you can just mention them to me. As long as our Nalan clan has it, we will definitely not be stingy.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;So you want to win me over early&#x2026;&#x201D; Xiao Yan sipped his tea, slightly shook his head and whispered in his heart.</p><p>The kind of prospects that an alchemist who possessed a &#x2018;Heavenly Flame&#x2019; was something that a strong person like Nalan Jie was extremely clear of. Therefore, Xiao Yan might only be a tier two alchemist now but Nalan Jie still had put in all his effort to win the former over. As the saying goes, &#x2018;one&#x2019;s mouth will be shorter after eating other people&#x2019;s things&#x2019;. If Xiao Yan really did as he had said and randomly took the medicinal ingredients from the Nalan clan, it would not be easy for Xiao Yan to reject Nalan Jie when he invited Xiao Yan to be an alchemist for the Nalan clan in the future.</p><p>&#x201C;I will come and find the two of you when I require them.&#x201D; Xiao Yan did not immediately reject him. However, his vague words did not agree either.</p><p>As a person who had become wise with age, Nalan Jie naturally could hear Xiao Yan&#x2019;s vague meaning. He smiled and his face did not have any disappointed emotion. With a smile, he diverted their topic of conversation and began to randomly inquire about some other information about Xiao Yan.</p><p>&#x201C;Haha. May I ask who is Little Brother Yan Xiao&#x2019;s teacher? I am able to recognize over half of the Jia Ma Empire&#x2019;s well known alchemists. However, I have never heard of any one of their students possessing a &#x2018;Heavenly Flame&#x2019; at such a young age.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Teacher doesn&#x2019;t like to reveal himself. He has been living in isolation. Before I left, his elderly self had instructed me not to reveal any information about him.&#x201D; Xiao Yan shook his head and said.</p><p>&#x201C;Since it&#x2019;s like this, I will not make things difficult for you.&#x201D; Hearing the words, Nalan Jie smiled and nodded. His heart, however, muttered, &#x201C;A strong person hidden from the world? With Yan Xiao&#x2019;s age, it is naturally impossible for him to rein in the &#x2018;Heavenly Flame&#x2019; by himself, I think that his Teacher should have given quite a lot of help on this. A strong person who could rein in a &#x2018;Heavenly Flame&#x2019; should at least be a Dou Huang. Looks like the strength behind this little fellow cannot be underestimated. If I can win him over, there would be many benefits&#x2026;&#x201D;</p><p>Following Xiao Yan&#x2019;s casual reply, time slowly passed by. The female servant that had gone to obtain the medicinal ingredients carried a silver plate and walked into the living room with a curled posture. She then respectfully placed the plate on the table beside Xiao Yan.</p><p>Glancing at those perfectly preserved medicinal ingredients on the silver plate, Xiao Yan nodded his head slightly. It looked like the Nalan clan had quite a number of skilled people who knew how to take care of their medicinal ingredients.</p><p>Xiao Yan cautiously stored the medicinal ingredients into his storage ring. Not intending to wait, Xiao Yan didn&#x2019;t continue to stay any longer. Immediately, he stood up and bid the other two goodbye.</p><p>&#x201C;Hehe, let us see Little Brother Yan Xiao off.&#x201D; Seeing Xiao Yan stand up, Nalan Jie also hurriedly did the same. After which, he and Nalan Su walked shoulder to shoulder out of the living room.</p><p>Once they were out of the room, they walked along a small path. The Nalan clan members who were coming and going hurriedly greeted them. They waited until the three of them walked away before facing each other in shock. Immediately afterwards, they threw their curious and surprised gazes at Xiao Yan. In the whole of the Jia Ma Empire, there were no more than five people who had the qualification for both, the old grandfather of the Nalan clan and the clan head to respectfully send someone off together. Yet this young person who appeared only around twenty years old actually possessed the qualification to enjoy such a respectful treatment?</p><p>Under the surprised and strange gazes throughout the journey, the three of them finally came to the main door. Xiao Yan bowed slightly toward Nalan Jie and Nalan Su. He was just about to leave when the corner of his eye suddenly stiffened at the sight of two human figures who were slowly walking over to the Nalan clan.</p><p>Of the two human figures, one was a male and the other was a female. The lady was wearing a moon white colored robe with trailing spacious sleeves. Her elegant footsteps caused people to have an extremely pleasing beautiful feeling. Her pretty face, which carried a little smile, hooked the gazes of the surrounding men as she passed by.</p><p>The man was wearing an alchemist long robe. His age was also quite young and his figure was tall and straight, appearing only slightly over twenty years old. His handsome face had lines that seemed to be carved by a knife, emitting a somewhat feminine feeling. The gentle smile on his face also had an easy time moving some ladies&#x2019; hearts. When comparing the appearance of this person to Xiao Yan&#x2019;s disguised appearance, it was like two polar regions that were extremely far apart.</p><p>Of course, the thing that attracted the most attention was still the alchemist badge on the young man&#x2019;s chest. On it, three silver colored ripples reflected an eye-piercing glow under the sunlight. Those passersby, whose heart originally had contained a sour feeling because of the other party having the company of such a beautiful woman, felt dull initially upon seeing the three silver colored ripples that represented his status. Immediately, the unhappiness in their eyes automatically turned into one of respect that one used when faced with a strong person.</p><p>The man and the lady slowly walked over. A talented man and a beautiful woman, a perfect couple. They attracted the attention of quite a number of eyes on the street. Immediately, numerous amazed and envious gazes were thrown over as two of them suddenly became the focus of attention on the street.</p><p>At the moment when Xiao Yan&#x2019;s gaze paused on the two of them, Nalan Jie and Nalan Su beside him also noticed the two people walking over. When their gazes swept onto the man by Nalan Yanran&#x2019;s side, each of their expressions were somewhat different.</p><p>Staring at the two of them who were slowly walking over, Xiao Yan lowered his head slightly. For some unknown reason, his heart faintly had a hint of anger. A long while later, he inhaled a breath of icy cool air. He understood that although he no longer had those feelings for the lady in front of him, she was still someone who had nearly become his wife regardless of all that had happened. Now that he saw her conversing and laughing with another man as they walked together, he would naturally feel a knot in his heart.</p><p>Xiao Yan raised his head. The emotions in his eyes were completely withdrawn by him as he calmly watched the two people who had arrived in front of him.</p><p>&#x201C;Mister Yan Xiao, we have troubled you again today.&#x201D; As the two people reached the main door, Nalan Yanran greeted Nalan Jie and Nalan Su before she smiled and spoke to Xiao Yan.</p><p>Xiao Yan did not open his mouth to speak. He merely shook his head. His face, which was covered by the icy silk mask, appeared slightly cold.</p><p>Having known Xiao Yan for a day, Nalan Yanran also knew about his indifferent character and was unconcerned with it. She pointed to the man by her side and said with a smile, &#x201C;Mister Yan Xiao, this is my friend, Liu Ling. He is also an alchemist.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Nice to meet you, Mister Yan Xiao.&#x201D; That handsome man extended his hand as he smiled and greeted Xiao Yan. His smile was extremely gentle, appearing quite sincere.</p><p>&#x201C;Nice to meet you.&#x201D; Xiao Yan extended his hand and held the other party&#x2019;s hand as he spoke calmly. His eyes watched Liu Ling. Ever since he had left Wu Tan City, the young man in front of him was the first young person who caused Xiao Yan to actually pay close attention to. Being able to become a tier three alchemist at such a young age, his talent was definitely not weaker than Xiao Yan.</p><p>&#x201C;Hey, Liu Ling boy, why have you run over here instead of learning refining skills from your teacher?&#x201D; Nalan Jie glanced at this man who was extremely outstanding. He sighed slightly in his heart. Liu Ling was the most outstanding young man that he had seen during these last few years. If one were to discuss about talent and ability, he was a man who was a good match to Nalan Yanran. He also knew that his extremely haughty granddaughter may also have a favorable impression of this very outstanding young man who was at her age. Although this small favorable impression was far from having any feelings, Liu Ling was one of the few males of her age who had given her a favorable impression in many years.</p><p>While Liu Ling was indeed very outstanding, the agreement with his old friend back then had always been in Nalan Jie&#x2019;s heart. Just thinking about the little fellow from the Xiao clan whose engagement was broken off, his heart was filled with regret and helplessness. Therefore, he had some resistance to Liu Ling and Nalan Yanran becoming too close. He was still trying to think up ways to rescue the already shattered pre-arranged marriage.</p><p>&#x201C;The Grand Meeting is about to begin soon. The Grand Meeting has gathered countless strong people in the empire&#x2019;s alchemist scene. There is always someone better than one. Therefore, Teacher has asked me to descend from the mountains and experience it for myself. Additionally, Teacher also asked me to send his regards to Old Sir.&#x201D; Liu Ling bowed slightly and replied with a smile.</p><p>&#x201C;Mister Yan Xiao, I didn&#x2019;t expect that you were able to help Old Sir remove the &#x2018;Searing Poison&#x2019; at such a young age. It really surprises people. Back then, Teacher had also come and taken a look, but did not have the slightest solution. Ha ha, I think that Mister Yan Xiao should be in possession of the legendary &#x2018;Heavenly Flame&#x2019;, right?&#x201D; Liu Ling turned his gaze to Xiao Yan by the side and laughed.</p><p>Xiao Yan&#x2019;s eyes narrowed as he probed Liu Ling and asked, &#x201C;Who is your teacher?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;My teacher is Gu He.&#x201D; Liu Ling gently smiled and said. Although he hid the pride in his smile very deeply, some of it still seeped out.</p><p>&#x201C;So it is Pill-King Gu He&#x2026;&#x201D; Xiao Yan muttered softly in his heart. He nodded, but the indifferentness on his face did not move because of this name that had once shaken the entire Jia Ma Empire.</p><p>Xiao Yan&#x2019;s calm manner caused Liu Ling to be startled; being able to become Pill-King Gu He&#x2019;s personal disciple had always been something that he was very proud of. However, in the eyes of the young man in front of him, it seemed to be nothing at all. Immediately, his eyebrows were pressed together slightly without being noticed before they immediately quickly relaxed. He smiled and asked Xiao Yan, &#x201C;May I know the name of Mister Yan Xiao&#x2019;s teacher?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Teacher is just an idler in the mountain and does not have a great reputation like the Pill-King Gu He has. He is not worth mentioning.&#x201D; Xiao Yan smiled and answered faintly. His very calm manner caused Nalan Jie, Nalan Yanran and the others to give him a sidelong glance.</p><p>&#x201C;Mister Yan Xiao is really humble. Even if we don&#x2019;t mention the &#x2018;Heavenly Flame&#x2019;, you have become a tier two alchemist at such an age. Your teacher&#x2019;s ability is naturally not weak in order to be able to teach a student like you.&#x201D; Nalan Yanran at the side covered her mouth and laughed.</p><p>&#x201C;I have no choice. This was all forced by someone&#x2026;&#x201D; Xiao Yan stared at Nalan Yanran&#x2019;s pretty face and suddenly mocked himself as he spoke softly.</p><p>Nalan Yanran was at a momentary loss. For some unknown reason, the eyes of the other party caused her heart to quiver without realizing it. She gently shook her head and was just about to say something when Xiao Yan cupped his hands together and shook them at everyone. He smiled faintly and said, &#x201C;I&#x2019;m sorry. I still have something to do and won&#x2019;t be able to accompany everyone to chat. Goodbye.&#x201D;</p><p>Once he said those words, Xiao Yan walked toward the street. After which, he gradually disappeared into the sea of people in front of the eyes of Nalan Yanran&#x2019;s group.</p><p>&#x201C;Yanran, does he really possess a &#x2018;Heavenly Flame&#x2019;?&#x201D; Seeing that Xiao Yan had disappeared, Liu Ling could not help but inquire again.</p><p>&#x201C;Yes. Mister Yan Xiao&#x2019;s ability is quite good. His flame controlling ability would not be lousier than yours. In terms of refining pills, he is the only one of similar age whom I have met in so many years that I think may actually exceed you.&#x201D; Nalan Yanran nodded her head. Her pretty eyes watched the end of the street and she felt a little absentminded. For some unknown reason, this cold young man kept giving her an extremely strange feeling. This kind of feeling was something that she had never felt from Liu Ling.</p><p>Liu Ling frowned as he eyed Nalan Yanran who was staring at the end of the street in a somewhat absentminded manner. His fist tensed slightly without him noticing while a faint sourness appeared in his heart...</p>
