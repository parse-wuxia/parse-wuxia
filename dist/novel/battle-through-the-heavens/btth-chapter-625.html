<p><strong><u>Chapter 625: Solving the Trouble</u></strong></p><p>&#x201C;First Elder, the heart flame inside the &#x2018;Blazing Sky Qi Refining Tower&#x2019; is indeed being gradually reduced. At this rate, it is likely that all of it will completely disappear not long later.&#x201D;</p><p>The expression on Su Qian&#x2019;s face became interesting after he had heard the result of an investigation by an Elder in the spacious hall. He clenched his teeth violently before becoming hopelessly depressed a moment later. His heart laughed bitterly. It was unexpected that the &#x2018;Heavenly Flame&#x2019; was not snatched by someone else, but was actually directly refined by this fellow.</p><p>The importance of the &#x2018;Blazing Sky Qi Refining Tower&#x2019; toward the Inner Academy was naturally extremely great. Otherwise, it would not cause Su Qian and the rest to guard it with their lives. Now, however, with the disappearance of the &#x2018;Fallen Heart Flame&#x2019;, its effect of raising one&#x2019;s training speed would also gradually weaken until it disappeared. In other words, there would no longer be much meaning to the existence of the &#x2018;Blazing Sky Qi Refining Tower&#x2019;.</p><p>Having lost the &#x2018;Blazing Sky Qi Refining Tower&#x2019;, the system of grooming strong people that the Inner Academy was proud of might well have been broken. The subsequent results would be extremely serious.</p><p>The atmosphere was a little quiet in the hall. All the Elders were also helpless as they watched the despondent expression of the First Elder. Now that the &#x2018;Fallen Heart Flame&#x2019; had already been refined by Xiao Yan, they could not simply just ask him to spit it out no? It was still fine if Xiao Yan was an enemy. They could forcefully capture him and remove the &#x2018;Fallen Heart Flame&#x2019;. However, the most troublesome thing was that this fellow had done quite a big favor for the Inner Academy. If Xiao Yan had not defeated those two Dou Huangs in the great battle two years ago, it was likely that the Inner Academy would have suffered severe losses in that fight.</p><p>Xiao Yan was also somewhat embarrassed as he sensed the atmosphere in the hall. Honestly speaking, he still felt a little apologetic toward Su Qian. After all, he had had intentions toward the &#x2018;Fallen Heart Flame&#x2019; from the moment he had entered Jia Nan Academy. Although he appeared to have been a great help to the academy in that great battle, his hidden motive was to try his best to have a bigger chance of obtaining the &#x2018;Fallen Heart Flame&#x2019;.</p><p>&#x201C;First Elder, is there any other method to remedy the situation?&#x201D; Xiao Yan carefully inquired. It was somewhat impossible for him to hand over the &#x2018;Fallen Heart Flame&#x2019; now that things had developed to this point. However, he also felt somewhat uneasy if he simply just watched the Inner Academy suffer such a great loss.</p><p>&#x201C;Ugh, from the looks of things now, it seems that we can only use a man-made &#x2018;Fallen Heart Flame&#x2019;. Otherwise, the effects of the &#x2018;Blazing Sky Qi Refining Tower&#x2019; will disappear completely.&#x201D; Su Qian was silent for a long time after hearing Xiao Yan&#x2019;s words. Only then did he sigh and said helplessly.</p><p>&#x201C;A man-made &#x2018;Fallen Heart Flame&#x2019;?&#x201D; Xiao Yan was startled. A &#x2018;Heavenly Flame&#x2019; could actually be man-made?</p><p>&#x201C;Creating this thing is not considered very difficult. Back then, the headmaster left behind a back-up &#x2018;Fallen Heart Flame&#x2019; container before he had left. As long as one pours some &#x2018;Fallen Heart Flame&#x2019; within it, it is still able to enable the &#x2018;Blazing Sky Qi Refining Tower&#x2019; to possess the effect of raising one&#x2019;s training speed. However, the effect will be a little worse than before.&#x201D; Su Qian looked at Xiao Yan before continuing, &#x201C;This requires your help. Separate a little of the &#x2018;Fallen Heart Flame&#x2019; and hand it to us. This should not be a problem right?&#x201D;</p><p>Xiao Yan quietly sigh in relief when he heard this. The &#x2018;Fallen Heart Flame&#x2019; had already been refined by him into an essence flame seed. As long as the Dou Qi in his body was not exhausted, it would be able to create an endless amount of it for use. Separating a little of it out may exhaust his Dou Qi, but he was already extremely satisfied that there was a method which achieved the best of both worlds.</p><p>&#x201C;However, that kind of summoned &#x2018;Fallen Heart Flame&#x2019; poses many limitations. Once my Dou Qi disappears, the flame will automatically disappear&#x2026;&#x201D; Xiao Yan could not help but speak with hesitation when he recalled this.</p><p>&#x201C;The container was created personally by the headmaster. You need not be concerned about this type of problem. However, this container can only attain a delaying effect. Hence, it is likely that you must periodically come to the Inner Academy to help replenish the flame of the &#x2018;Blazing Sky Qi Refining Tower&#x2019;...&#x201D; Su Qian mused out loud.</p><p>&#x201C;Periodically returning to the Inner Academy?&#x201D; Xiao Yan was a little startled as he laughed bitterly, &#x201C;Is there an exact timeframe for this &#x2018;periodically&#x2019;? If I leave the Inner Academy in the future, I won&#x2019;t have to return to this place once every half a month or month right?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;This is something that I&#x2019;m not very certain. However, as long as you leave enough flame for us to store, it should not be a problem maintaining it for one to two years.&#x201D; Su Qian thought for a moment before speaking.</p><p>&#x201C;That&#x2019;s good&#x2026;&#x201D; Xiao Yan sighed and nodded with a smile, &#x201C;Alright, I&#x2019;ll do as First Elder recommends.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Ugh, brat, you got it cheap. It is really unexpected that the thing which Han Feng failed to obtain despite putting in so much effort was easily obtained by you. Our Inner Academy has protected it with great difficulty for so many years only to benefit you, little fellow.&#x201D; Su Qian rolled his eyes. His voice was somewhat sour as he spoke. He naturally understood the effect of the &#x2018;Fallen Heart Flame&#x2019; best. Xiao Yan had refined it. Therefore, his originally frightening training speed would likely soar greatly in the future. Such a temptation was extremely great to anyone.</p><p>Xiao Yan smiled awkwardly before immediately knitting his brows together. He slowly asked, &#x201C; Han Feng&#x2026; is currently still in the &#x2018;Black-Corner Region&#x2019; right?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Aye.&#x201D;</p><p>Su Qian narrowed his eyes. A faint cold glint flashed past them. He firmly remembered the matter of Han Feng gathering a large group of experts to attack the Inner Academy in his heart even now.</p><p>&#x201C;Ke ke, that is even better. There are some matters that I should look for him to settle.&#x201D; Xiao Yan crossed his fingers and laughed. His smile emitted threads of dense coldness. That fellow had luckily escaped back then. Now that he was able to come out from that lifeless magma area, the first thing he needed to do was naturally finish off the matter with this &#x2018;Senior&#x2019;. Otherwise, how would he account to Yao Lao who was currently in a slumber.</p><p>&#x201C;Although your strength has soared greatly. It is likely a little difficult to do so by yourself.&#x201D;</p><p>Su Qian shook his head and voiced his thoughts, &#x201C;Han Feng has established a &#x2018;Black Alliance&#x2019; in the &#x2018;Black-Corner Region&#x2019;. Quite a number of relatively strong factions have joined it. Currently, the number of strong people in the &#x2018;Black Alliance&#x2019; are as numerous as the clouds. Even I have a never ending headache because of it. During the two years in which you were not around, the Inner Academy has gone to find trouble with those fellows a couple of times. However, most of them were blocked by the &#x2018;Black Alliance&#x2019;.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Black Alliance?&#x201D; Xiao Yan knit his brows. His finger gently knocked against the surface of the table. A moment later, he finally spoke, &#x201C;In that case&#x2026; does First Elder not want to get back at them?&#x201D;</p><p>A fierce glint flashed across Su Qian&#x2019;s eyes as he spoke ferociously, &#x201C;Why would I not want to? The Inner Academy&#x2019;s reputation cannot worsen in my hands. Otherwise, how will I account to the headmaster when he returns in the future?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Ke ke, that&#x2019;s good. First Elder, you should gather some people. We will head to the &#x2018;Black-Corner Region&#x2019; in three days!&#x201D; Xiao Yan&#x2019;s finger paused before he stood up and laughed.</p><p>&#x201C;Alright, since you are interested, our Inner Academy will join the fun!&#x201D; Su Qian&#x2019;s palm heavily slammed on the table as he also laughed out loud. Now that he had the participation of Xiao Yan, this extremely strong fellow, it was likely that they would be able to break the stalemate with the &#x2018;Black Alliance&#x2019; during these two years.</p><p>&#x201C;I will gather all the helpers in three days. After that, it is time to completely end our conflict with the &#x2018;Black Alliance&#x2019;!&#x201D;</p><p>Xiao Yan smiled and nodded.</p><p>&#x201C;However&#x2026;&#x201D; Su Qian appeared to have recalled something as he frowned a little. He looked at Xiao Yan and spoke, &#x201C;Before this, I think that you should settle the conflict with that expert Dou Zong who has come and looked for trouble with you. Otherwise, if she comes and intervenes during that great battle&#x2026; you should also be clearly aware just what kind of fighting strength a Dou Zong possesses. If she were to join the &#x2018;Black Alliance&#x2019;, we would suffer great losses even if our entire army isn&#x2019;t destroyed.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;She will definitely not join the &#x2018;Black Alliance&#x2019;.&#x201D; Xiao Yan smiled as he observed Su Qian&#x2019;s stern face. He sighed, &#x201C;Alright, I will settle the problem with her first.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Do you need our help?&#x201D; Su Qian hesitated for a moment before asking.</p><p>&#x201C;Ke ke, relax. The presence of more people will not help the problem between her and me.&#x201D; Xiao Yan laughed bitterly as he cupped his hands toward Su Qian. He said, &#x201C;Since I have already accounted for most of the things, I should return first.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Wait.&#x201D;</p><p>Su Qian mused for a moment after seeing Xiao Yan turned around. After which, he slowly said, &#x201C;I think I should tell you something.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;What is it?&#x201D; Xiao Yan turned his head doubtfully.</p><p>&#x201C;Your second brother is in the &#x2018;Black-Corner Region&#x2019; right?&#x201D; Su Qian&#x2019;s voice had just sounded when he sensed the aura all over Xiao Yan suddenly rose. A pair of old eyes which were filled with surprise were raised as he watched the young man whose face had instantly become dark and cold.</p><p>&#x201C;What has happened to my second brother?&#x201D; Xiao Yan&#x2019;s voice was as cold as ice and void of any emotion.</p><p>&#x201C;Currently, nothing has happened to him.&#x201D; Su Qian suppressed the surprise in his heart and widened his hands. He said, &#x201C;I have sent some people to quietly protect him after you had been dragged underground by the &#x2018;Fallen Heart Flame&#x2019;. He was merely quietly training for the first half of the year. However, one year later he was chased into the deep mountains by some people who were after his life. It was two months later when he next appeared. At that time, his strength had suddenly and strangely soared to the Dou Wang class. I am not certain what happened to him in the deep mountains.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;According to the information gathered, he has quietly established an extremely secretive organization within the &#x2018;Black-Corner Region&#x2019;. This organization currently has quite a strong reputation within the &#x2018;Black-Corner Region&#x2019; because they purposefully pick members of the &#x2018;Black Alliance to kill&#x2019;. Moreover, they kill whoever they meet. Clearly, your second brother is taking revenge for you.&#x201D;</p><p>Xiao Yan&#x2019;s face recovered its calmness as he quietly nodded. It was good that nothing had happened to second brother.</p><p>However, his expression had just calmed down when Su Qian&#x2019;s subsequent words caused it to become completely dark.</p><p>&#x201C;Due to your second brother killing the members of the &#x2018;Black Alliance&#x2019; for a long time, he has aroused the anger of the &#x2018;Black Alliance&#x2019;. According to the information I got, it seems that a few factions who are quite strong have begun encircling your second brother and his organization. It is likely that his current condition is not very good.&#x201D;</p><p>At this moment, the face of the black-robed young man was frighteningly dark and cold. It even contained a faint savageness. The icy-cold voice of his contained an incomparable amount of killing intent.</p><p>&#x201C;Do you have my second older brother&#x2019;s location?&#x201D;</p>
