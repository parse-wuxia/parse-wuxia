<p><strong><u>Chapter 517: Reappearance of Queen Medusa</u></strong></p><p>Xiao Yan flew down from the top of the mountain dome, and once again found himself beside the green rock. His gaze eyed the creamy-white liquid within the notch. Although this had already been diluted, its effect was still quite good. Even if it could not achieve the effect of washing and refining the bones, it also had quite a great refining effect on the body.</p><p>&#x201C;You can also collect some of this. Perhaps, you might be able to use it when you refine pills in the future.&#x201D; Yao Lao&#x2019;s voice sounded above Xiao Yan&#x2019;s head.</p><p>Xiao Yan nodded when he heard this. He took out two jade bottles from within his storage ring and carefully filled them with the cream-colored &#x2018;Core Quenching Body Milk.&#x2019; After filling the two jade bottles, there was nearly less than half of the cream liquid remaining in the notch.</p><p>Xiao Yan glanced at the remaining liquid. He mused for a while, but did not completely take it all away. Lin Xiu Ya and the others might well come and take this &#x2018;Core Quenching Body Milk&#x2019; in the future. If they returned empty-handed after toiling for half a day, they would undoubtedly have some doubts about someone else taking the thing away. Moreover, only the few of them and himself knew that there was a unique treasure in this place. Although Xiao Yan was not afraid of their suspicions, this &#x2018;Core Quenching Body Milk&#x2019; was ultimately something that Han Yue had discovered no matter how one put it. Xiao Yan had gained a great bargain for no reason. It would indeed be somewhat overboard for him to be greedy and take everything away.</p><p>Xiao Yan stored the two bottles of diluted &#x2018;Core Quenching Body Milk&#x2019; into his storage ring as these thoughts circulated in his heart. After which, he no longer paused as he turned his body and swiftly flew along the path which he had taken. Since he had already familiarized himself with the path before, Xiao Yan had reduced quite a lot of time when he exited this time around. In merely less than twenty minutes, he exited the mountain cave.</p><p>With a flap of his wings, Xiao Yan flew toward the exit of the valley. His gaze eyed the area a distance away. He was still able to see the vaguely visible seven-colored glow and the thunder-like energy explosions within the dark night.</p><p>Xiao Yan only sighed in relief when he saw that the seven-colored glow was still bright. He swiftly flapped his wings and his body transformed into a black shadow which shuttled through the dark night without any noise. Some time later, his body paused as it appeared in the air above the mountain valley. His gaze glanced at the battleground outside, and he could not help but be a little speechless.</p><p>At this moment, the entrance to the valley had been damaged until it appeared completely different. The originally flat ground was covered by enormous craters while enormous rocks that fell from the mountain wall were spread all over the place. The forest on both sides were also wrecked; trees laid horizontally and even covered half of the path into the valley.</p><p>The &#x2018;Heaven Swallowing Python&#x2019; was still curled up as it lingered in the air within this battleground. Seven-colored glows surged out of its body unceasingly. The powerful suppression caused all the Magical Beasts hidden in a five kilometer radius to shiver. Although the Qi of the &#x2018;Heaven Swallowing Python&#x2019; was still powerful, one was still able to see some deep claw scars on the seven-colored snake&#x2019;s scales if one were to look carefully. Clearly, the former was not in an undefeatable position in its fight with the &#x2018;Snow Demon Sky Ape.&#x2019;</p><p>Xiao Yan&#x2019;s gaze drifted down. When he eyed the &#x2018;Snow Demon Sky Ape&#x2019; on the ground, a stunned look involuntarily flashed across Xiao Yan&#x2019;s face. At this moment, over half of the snow white fur on the beast was corroded by the snake&#x2019;s saliva with its strong acidic properties. Fresh blood flowed on its enormous head, causing the originally terrible looking head to appear even more savage. Scars from being struck by powerful energy could be seen everywhere on its body. Some fear and weariness appeared within those originally large, lantern-like bright-red eyes. Clearly, the &#x2018;Snow Demon Sky Ape,&#x2019; which was already in a weakened state, had already completely lost its fighting spirit when faced with a strong opponent like the &#x2018;Heaven Swallowing Python&#x2019;.</p><p>Compared to the miserable appearance of the &#x2018;Snow Demon Sky Ape,&#x2019; the little injuries on the &#x2018;Heaven Swallowing Python&#x2019; appeared to be insignificant.</p><p>&#x201C;It is really unexpected that this little fellow is actually this strong. It is really worthy of being a unique beast from ancient times.&#x201D; Xiao Yan eyed the difference in the injuries of both parties and involuntarily muttered in surprise within his heart.</p><p>Xiao Yan&#x2019;s appearance similarly attracted the attention of both the &#x2018;Heaven Swallowing Python&#x2019; and the &#x2018;Snow Demon Sky Ape.&#x2019; The former extended its snake&#x2019;s tongue somewhat excitedly at Xiao Yan. On the other hand, the latter emitted a furious roar somewhat restlessly.</p><p>&#x201C;Little fellow, go!&#x201D; Xiao Yan ignored the &#x2018;Snow Demon Sky Ape&#x2019; which was roaring while facing the sky. He cried out to the &#x2018;Heaven Swallowing Python&#x2019; before immediately flapping his wings. His body flew swiftly in the direction of the deep mountains.</p><p>The &#x2018;Heaven Swallowing Python&#x2019; hesitated a little behind him before swinging its enormous tail. The seven-colored glow which intensified around its body swiftly shrunk. After which, it transformed into a tiny light shadow that swiftly rushed toward Xiao Yan. Finally, the two figures gradually disappeared in the black night, leaving behind the furious but helpless &#x2018;Snow Demon Sky Ape&#x2019; who was in a frenzied state.</p><p>A large and small figure suddenly descended from the sky within the dark night. Finally, they landed on a mountain peak. Xiao Yan turned around and eyed the mountain valley which had already disappeared from the edge of his sight. Only then did he sigh in relief.</p><p>Xiao Yan turned his head over and eyed the &#x2018;Heaven Swallowing Python&#x2019; suspended in front of him. At this moment, the glow of the seven-colored scales had quietly become dimmer. From the looks of it, its exhaustion from the intense fight with the &#x2018;Snow Demon Sky Ape&#x2019; earlier was very great. Xiao Yan&#x2019;s hand gently rubbed the small head of the &#x2018;Heaven Swallowing Python.&#x2019; He took out a bottle of &#x2018;Amethyst Essence&#x2019; from his storage ring and smiled as he said, &#x201C;Come, little fellow. You have done well tonight. This time around, I will let you eat until you are full.</p><p>If it was in the past, it was likely that the &#x2018;Heaven Swallowing Python&#x2019; would immediately pounce over when it saw Xiao Yan take out the &#x2018;Amethyst Essence.&#x2019; However, the &#x2018;Heaven Swallowing Python&#x2019; strangely stopped in air without moving. A pair of bewitching snake eyes glanced at Xiao Yan. Just as a feeling of something being wrong appeared in Xiao Yan&#x2019;s heart, an icy-cold voice was suddenly emitted from the mouth of the &#x2018;Heaven Swallowing Python,&#x2019; &#x201C;You are actually really treating me as a pet to rear?&#x201D; The voice may have been ice-cold, but it contained a numb feeling that caused a nefarious flame to rise in Xiao Yan&#x2019;s heart.</p><p>Just as the nefarious flame rose within Xiao Yan&#x2019;s lower abdomen, he suddenly felt a coldness seeping out from his heart. His eyes suddenly stared at the &#x2018;Heaven Swallowing Python&#x2019; in front of him, and he was stunned for an instant. His body hurriedly withdrew in a lightning-like matter as he uttered in shock, &#x201C;Queen Medusa?&#x201D;</p><p>During the time that Xiao Yan was rushing back, the &#x2018;Heaven Swallowing Python&#x2019; once again emitted a faint seven-colored glow. Its body also gradually moved. An instant later, it transformed into an enchanting and alluring being that could basically cause a man to instantly turn into a beast.</p><p>Although Xiao Yan clearly knew in his heart that this was a beautiful human snake that could eat people in front of him, he was still unable to help but feel a little distracted. However, this distracted feeling immediately disappeared when a pair of cold ice-like pupils glanced over, leaving behind only his guard and caution.</p><p>Xiao Yan&#x2019;s gaze finally stopped on the ice-cold bewitching face, which one could not find any flaws. He laughed dryly, only to realize that his voice had turned somewhat hoarse.</p><p>&#x201C;Your Majesty, what a coincidence. We meet again.&#x201D; The extremely stupid greeting was sufficient to show just what degree of anxiety Xiao Yan felt within his heart. The fear he had for this woman in front of him was even stronger than what he felt for Yun Shan from the Misty Cloud Sect.</p><p>&#x201C;What a coincidence. However, I must thank you for that. If you did not let the &#x2018;Heaven Swallowing Python&#x2019; fight with &#x2018;Snow Demon Sky Ape&#x2019; and exhaust a great amount of energy in the process, I would still be suppressed by it.&#x201D; Queen Medusa glanced at Xiao Yan. The corner of her sleek, red mouth was lifted into a mocking manner.</p><p>Xiao Yan parted his mouth and could not resist thinking of giving himself a slap. It was unexpected that the culprit was himself&#x2026;</p><p>&#x201C;Have you gathered all the medicinal ingredients to refine the &#x2018;Thawing Spirit Spill?&#x2019;&#x201D; Queen Medusa ignored Xiao Yan&#x2019;s ugly expression as she asked in an indifferent manner.</p><p>The corner of Xiao Yan&#x2019;s eyes twitched as he laughed bitterly in his heart. What gather them all? He had never put this matter in his heart. Just settling his own things had already made him terribly busy. Where did he get the time to help her search for the medicinal ingredients for the &#x2018;Thawing Spirit Pill?&#x2019; Moreover, even if he did have the time, he would definitely delay it as long as he can. Otherwise, once this woman obtained the &#x2018;Thawing Spirit Pill&#x2019; and merged her spirit with that of the &#x2018;Heaven Swallowing Python,&#x2019; the first person to be unlucky was likely himself. This damn woman had never hidden her killing intent for him from the start.</p><p>However, he did understand her after thinking a little. With Queen Medusa&#x2019;s noble identity and her haughty character, how would she be able to endure being turned into a pet and fighter that Xiao Yan was currently rearing? If it were not because of the &#x2018;Thawing Spirit Pill&#x2019; and the repeated rebound of the spirit of the &#x2018;Heaven Swallowing Python,&#x2019; it was likely that she would have long since used a few slaps to tear Xiao Yan apart.</p><p>A cold smile and killing intent gradually surfaced on Queen Medusa&#x2019;s face when she saw Xiao Yan&#x2019;s silent and speechless manner. &#x201C;Looks like you did not put this matter in your heart. Since this is the case, what is the use of leaving you around?&#x201D;</p><p>Queen Medusa suddenly waved her delicate hand when she said this. Following the waving of her hand, Xiao Yan was shocked to realize that the surrounding space had solidified at this moment. His body was locked within it, and he was unable to move.</p><p>&#x201C;Is this the true strength of an elite Dou Zong? They can actually solidify space by just raising their hands?&#x201D; Shock flashed across Xiao Yan&#x2019;s heart. His knowledge of the strength of an elite Dou Zong became much deeper.</p><p>Queen Medusa coldly eyed Xiao Yan as he struggled with all his strength. She moved her feet, one after the other, and slowly walked toward Xiao Yan. She lifted her hand vertically and a faint seven-colored glow gathered on her palm. Finally, it agglomerated into a sharp seven-colored longsword.</p><p>Xiao Yan used all his strength to struggle, but the surrounding space did not move even a little. Just as he was about to helplessly give up, a familiar, powerful Spiritual ripple finally swarmed out from the black-colored ring on his hand. Under the undulation of this Spiritual ripple, the surrounding cage-like solidified space suddenly shattered. Xiao Yan&#x2019;s body obtained freedom at this moment.</p><p>&#x201C;Ke ke, being able to solidify space after just advancing to the Dou Zong class. You are really worthy of being Queen Medusa. However, who are you to just kill the disciple of Yao Chen just because you want to?&#x201D; An old laugh slowly sounded. Yao Lao&#x2019;s illusionary body rose out from the dark-black ring. Finally, he was suspended beside Xiao Yan as he indifferently watched Queen Medusa on the opposite side.</p>
