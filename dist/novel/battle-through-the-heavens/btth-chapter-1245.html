<p><strong><u>Chapter 1245: Ancient Forest</u></strong></p><p>The process of subduing the Earth Demon Puppets was far smoother than what Xiao Yan had expected. This was because he did not discover even a trace of spiritual imprint in the body of these Earth Demon Puppets. This kind of situation also caused Xiao Yan to feel quite lost. Perhaps it was because the countless amount of time had eroded the spiritual imprint or perhaps that Dou Sheng class ancient expert did not possess much interest in these puppets that he had randomly created and was even too lazy to place even a trace of spiritual imprint.</p><p>Regardless of what the reason was, when Xiao Yan&#x2019;s Spiritual Strength invaded the bodies of these Earth Demon Puppet, he had discovered that he had already established a relationship with them. This process was without even the slightest difficult. Even if some other random person was to give it a try, he would be immediately able to control them.</p><p>Therefore, Xiao Yan&#x2019;s expression had become quite strange after having kept all these puppets into his Storage Ring. His eyes glanced towards the gray clothed old man, who was being beaten to the point of vomiting blood earlier. He quietly thought in his heart about whether this old fellow would vomit blood from anger should he be aware that the method to pass through this place was so simple that it caused one to feel a disbelief?</p><p>&#x201C;This little fellow&#x2026; he has actually subdued those puppets.&#x201D;</p><p>Everyone on the square was looking at Xiao Yan in a speechless manner while that strange thought rose within Xiao Yan&#x2019;s heart. It had only been two to three minutes but the ten peak Dou Zong class powerful puppet, which could even fight against a two star Dou Zun with their combined strength, had actually landed in Xiao Yan&#x2019;s hands. For a moment, the expressions of quite a number of people became exceptionally interesting. The envy and jealousy within their eyes could not be hidden. A puppet that had the strength equivalent to a two star Dou Zun. This was sufficient to stir the envy of anyone regardless of where one placed it.</p><p>These people, especially those who had some grudge with Xiao Yan like Lei zun-zhe, Bing He zun-zhe and the rest, were envious and unwilling to resign to the situation. The stronger the strength around Xiao Yan meant that the threat towards them would be greater.</p><p>Xiao Yan merely took a glance and withdrew his sight in the face of the gazes from these fellows. No matter how these fellows view him with dislike, they would not dare to attack him here. The motive of this trip of theirs was the Tian class Dou Skill within the remains. How would they dare to engage in a life and death battle with Xiao Yan&#x2019;s group before they obtain it?</p><p>&#x201C;Creak&#x2026;&#x201D;</p><p>Soon after Xiao Yan kept those ten puppets into his Storage Ring, the tightly shut stone door emitted a creaking mechanical sound. That heavy thick stone door was also slowly opened to reveal a hole&#x2026;</p><p>A desolate ancient aura slowly drifted out following the gradual opening of the stone door. This caused quite a number of people to adopt a solemn expression. An item from the ancient times was quite scared to quite a number of people.</p><p>Upon seeing the opening stone door, Xiao Yan&#x2019;s figure moved and gently drifted backwards. After which, he once again returned to his position from earlier. The corner of the mouth of quite a number of people twitched upon seeing this action of his. They quietly cursed &#x2018;crafty brat&#x2019; in their hearts. It was obvious that Xiao Yan did not wish to be the first to enter this mysterious remains&#x2026;</p><p>The main door was slowly completely opened and the creaking sound also gradually halted. Everyone on the square looked at each other. However, no one took the lead to walk in.</p><p>Xiao Yan ignored the silence on the square. He rubbed the Storage Ring with his finger. The smile on the corner of his mouth was quite brilliant. It was unexpected that he had obtained such a treasure after just having entered the remains. This was considered good luck&#x2026;</p><p>There were occasionally some experts who would hurry over from outside of the square. Clearly, they were experts who had discovered the secret of the fire path. Upon seeing an increasing number of experts gathering at this place, those experts and factions that were the first to arrive became a little impatient. A moment later, there was finally someone who could not endure it any longer and took the lead to slowly walk into the stone door. Fortunately, no miserable cry appeared this time around.</p><p>Everyone suddenly sighed in relief upon seeing that nothing happened to the leading goat.</p><p>&#x201C;Let&#x2019;s go.&#x201D;</p><p>Xiao Yan smiled slightly. He let out a low cry as his foot stomped onto the ground. His body transformed into a black shadow that rushed into the remains behind the stone door with lightning like speed. Little Fairy Doctor and the rest quickly followed behind him.</p><p>&#x201C;This cunning fellow!&#x201D;</p><p>Quite a number of people cursed in their hearts when they saw Xiao Yan moving immediately after seeing that there was no danger. They also quickly moved their bodies and raised their speed to the maximum. All of them flooded into the large hall like floodwater.</p><p>Xiao Yan&#x2019;s group was quick to charge in. In the blink of an eye, they had already entered the stone door. After which, their speed was reduced. Their eyes were stunned as they watched the scene that appeared in front of them.</p><p>The thing that appeared in front of them was an incomparably large hall. A person would feel exceptionally tiny when standing in this large hall. Everyone looked around them and discovered that there were quite a number of deep corridors around the large hall that extended to an unknown location. At this moment, there were already quite a few factions and experts who had charged in. They had began to separate and rush towards those pathway.</p><p>&#x201C;Zi Yan, can you sense something?&#x201D; Xiao Yan knitted his eyebrows as he looked at these pathways with ends that could not be seen. He turned towards Zi Yan by the side and asked. This place was still the entrance area of the large hall. Its interior would definitely be even more complicated. They would really have a tough time searching if they charged around randomly.</p><p>&#x201C;I am able to sniff some scent of medicinal ingredients. However, it is very vague&#x2026;&#x201D; Zi Yan twitched her nose and said.</p><p>&#x201C;Lead the way.&#x201D; Xiao Yan hurriedly said with some joy.</p><p>&#x201C;Understood.&#x201D;</p><p>Zi Yan nodded. She identified their direction before rushing towards a path at the left of the large hall. Xiao Yan&#x2019;s group hurriedly followed.</p><p>The pathway of the large hall was extremely wide. The couple of them appeared just like little birds flying within it. It was also possible to see some other experts coming to seek for treasures along the way. Fortunately, they did not head over and disturb Xiao Yan&#x2019;s group.</p><p>There were occasionally some rooms located at the two side of this path. At times, a large group of people would swarm over like bandits and began to thoroughly search the rooms. Although this action was very barbaric, there were indeed some lucky fellows who had found some Qi Method and Dou Skills. However, their class were not very high. The best of of all them had only reached the Di class. Even though this was the case, the one who obtained the treasure would still end up attracting quite a number of fiery hot gazes.</p><p>While Xiao Yan&#x2019;s group was following the medicinal ingredient scent in their search, they would occasionally barge into a couple of rooms but they did not obtain anything useful. It was likely that the true treasures were not kept in these places.</p><p>Seeing that these rooms would not provide much reward, Xiao Yan&#x2019;s group also completely withdrew their attentions from them. They focused on following behind Zi Yan. After they had flew for around fifteen minutes or so in the corridor, Zi Yan at the front gradually came to a halt.</p><p>The eyes of Xiao Yan&#x2019;s group were instantly thrown towards the front after seeing Zi Yan coming to a halt. There was an extremely ancient stone door at that spot. A great amount of moss had climbed over the stone door, allowing one to sense just how long had passed.</p><p>&#x201C;This place has the densest scent of medicinal ingredient. It is likely this is where the medicinal ingredients are stored. I wonder if they are spoilt after so many years.&#x201D; Zi Yan pointed at the stone door and said.</p><p>&#x201C;Unlikely. An elite Dou Sheng has many ways to preserve medicinal ingredients forever.&#x201D; Xiao Yan shook his head. He slowly stepped forwards and carefully checked the place. Only after discovering that there was no trap did he use his strength to push the stone door open.</p><p>&#x201C;Rumble!&#x201D;</p><p>Amidst a low and deep noise, the mossed covered thick heavy stone door was being slowly pushed open. Waves of rich medicinal fragrance that had been hidden for countless number of years immediately surged out. It caused the mind of everyone to be braced.</p><p>A surprise also flashed across Xiao Yan&#x2019;s eyes when he sniffed this fragrance. He increased the strength on his hand and the stone door was completely pushed opened.</p><p>A glaring bright light shot out the instant the stone door was fully opened. This caused the eyes of Xiao Yan&#x2019;s group to be narrowed. They swiftly took two steps back and the Dou Qi within their bodies also swiftly began to circulate. They were prepared to intervene in any sudden unexpected situations.</p><p>The light gradually weakened and everyone&#x2019;s eyes were once again opened. Immediately, they gently inhaled a breath of cool air.</p><p>Behind the stone door was not a stone room as everyone had expected. Instead, it was a forest&#x2026; an ancient forest that was completely made up of various rare and precious medicinal ingredients!</p><p>&#x201C;Damnit&#x2026; compared to the medicinal ingredients here, the Ten Thousand Medicinal Mountain Range of mine is really nothing&#x2026;&#x201D; Xiong Zhan looked at these many medicinal ingredients that were extremely rare in the outside world. His face was completely stunned.</p><p>&#x201C;Hu&#x2026;&#x201D;</p><p>Xiao Yan was also violently stunned by this ancient forest, which was completely made up of rare and precious medicinal ingredients. It was a long time later before he gradually recovered. He swiftly pulled everyone in before shutting the stone door behind them. Although he knew that this was not very useful to those bandit like fellows, this would at least cause some people to miss it. Such a frightening medicinal ingredient reserve definitely possessed an allure that could not be resisted to some factions.</p><p>&#x201C;Wow, this is a good place!&#x201D;</p><p>Zi Yan&#x2019;s eyes appeared to have countless number of tiny stars in them at this moment. She wiped off her saliva and finally leaped without being able to control. After which, she reached into some ganoderma with an extremely rich energy and grabbed it. She subsequently stuffed it into her mouth. The medicinal ingredients here had an exceptionally dense energy after having grown for countless of years. This was a great nourishment for Zi Yan. Although its taste was a little inferior before having undergone Xiao Yan&#x2019;s refinement, the rich energy was able to allow Zi Yan to bolt out the taste.</p><p>Xiao Yan felt neither able to laugh nor cry when he saw this action of hers. His gaze swept around him and forcefully endured the impulse to place all the medicinal ingredients in this forest into his Storage Ring. With a wave of his hand, he walked towards the deep parts of the forest. Currently, there was not much time for him to take all of the medicinal ingredients here with him.</p><p>&#x201C;Let&#x2019;s go and find the Soul Baby Fruit first!&#x201D;</p><p>Little Fairy Doctor&#x2019;s group nodded. After which, she pulled Zi Yan, who was lying within the medicinal ingredient pile and refusing to move, up. Next, they followed Xiao Yan and walked into this ancient forest.</p>
