<p><strong><u>Chapter 715: Explosion of the Fire Lotus</u></strong></p><p>Yun Shan&#x2019;s expression immediately became ugly when his gaze swept over the three different colored fire lotus that was suspended above Xiao Yan&#x2019;s palm. The frightening energy that seeped out from that strange fire lotus was something that caused even him to feel a kind of unusual pressure.</p><p>&#x201C;How can this bastard perform such a powerful attack with his strength?&#x201D; Yun Shan furiously roared within his heart. His forward charging figure immediately paused before his body swiftly rushed backward. A majestic deep-green Dou Qi suddenly surged out from his body like a torrent when he was hurrying away. His hair was all standing straight, appearing as though he had been electrocuted. In a mere instant, that powerful Dou Qi formed a green-colored tornado that was over a hundred feet large in the sky. His body was completely covered by that tornado.</p><p>Numerous gazes on the open ground looked at Yun Shan who managed to rely on his own powerful Dou Qi to agglomerate such a large tornado within a short period of time. They could not help but whistle a praise. He was indeed worthy of being an expert at the Dou Zong class. This skill alone was something that not a single elite Dou Huang present could display.</p><p>The enormous green-colored tornado covered Yun Shan&#x2019;s entire body, whizzing as it rotated at a fast speed. Wild wind raged and blew quite a number of people below until they were falling in all directions. Some of the weaker people ended up moving back continuously before eventually being pushed to the ground. Their faces were filled with shock as they looked at the large tornado that basically covered the entire sky. This kind of frightening nature-like strength was summoned using Yun Shan&#x2019;s own strength. It was indeed terrifying.</p><p>The whistling wild wind raged in the sky above the Misty Cloud Mountain. The sea of trees on the mountain range had begun to suddenly sway along with the wind. Waves of green-colored tree waves appeared from the middle before forming a circular shape that swept in all directions.</p><p>Xiao Yan was also startled when he saw Yun Shan suddenly create such a large commotion. A cold smile immediately surfaced on his pale-white face. He lowered his head and glanced at the three different colored fire lotus that was suspended in his hand. This kind of &#x2018;Angry Buddha Lotus Flame&#x2019; that was formed from the merger of three kinds of &#x2018;Heavenly Flame&#x2019; did not achieve a perfect stage during this short period of time. However, with the help of his outstanding Spiritual Strength, he was able to barely maintain it at an equilibrium. The wild, violent energy contained within was naturally many times stronger compared to the two &#x2018;Heavenly Flames&#x2019; fire lotus of the past.</p><p>Just by merging the three types of heavenly flames had nearly used up all of Xiao Yan&#x2019;s Dou Qi to the point where even his spiritual strength started to dry up slightly. The three colored fire lotus might have an impressive amount of strength, it also took a scary amount to form. Thus, even with Xiao Yan&#x2019;s current strength, he could only barely maintain the three types of heavenly flames at an equilibrium with all of his strength.</p><p>F</p><p>Xiao Yan&#x2019;s eyes stared intently at the enormous tornado that had spread over the entire sky. The tearing force that was emitted from within still caused Xiao Yan&#x2019;s body to sway a little despite him being located quite far away. Of course, this was naturally also because of his body being extremely weary after having forcefully merged the three kinds of &#x2018;Heavenly Flame&#x2019;.</p><p>The blackish-green wings on Xiao Yan&#x2019;s back had become much thinner at this moment. All of this proved that at this moment, Xiao Yan was completely spent!</p><p>Despite this, the fire lotus held in his hand that contained an unusually frightening energy caused even an expert like Yun Shan to be afraid of taking the initiative to attack. Instead, he hurriedly activated his firmest defense. He was afraid that should the fire lotus attack, he would be the first to perish under that fire.</p><p>The three different colored fire lotus slowly rotated above Xiao Yan&#x2019;s hand. Borrowing this momentary period of rest, the &#x2018;Flame Mantra&#x2019; Qi Method within Xiao Yan&#x2019;s body also began to hurriedly absorb some of the natural energy. After which, it acted in concert with the medicinal strength that had not been completely digested within his body. The energy was swiftly refined before finally transforming into pure Dou Qi that flowed within his exhausted Qi Paths.</p><p>Xiao Yan used the gap where the Dou Qi in his body was recovering as he carried a gaze with deep thought and swept over the battleground that Yao Lao and Protector Wu were located. This was the first time that Xiao Yan had witnessed Yao Lao truly using his spiritual body to fight with someone. Although a spiritual body was unable to use Dou Qi, that majestic Spiritual Strength of his was not in any way inferior to the strength of Dou Qi. Moreover, it was without form or color and its attacks were strange and unpredictable.</p><p>Of course, an ordinary Spiritual Strength attack would have its strength greatly reduced for some unknown reason when used against an expert from the &#x2018;Hall of Souls&#x2019;. However, Yao Lao was not an ordinary spiritual body. Being in possession of the &#x2018;Bone Chilling Flame&#x2019;, not only did he not need to fear the strange chain attacks of Protector Wu but the special effect of the &#x2018;Heavenly Flame&#x2019; also caused that Protector Wu to appear quite miserable when dealing with it. The black fog that spread all over his body repeatedly fluctuated under that unusual temperature that appeared both hot and cold.</p><p>That Protector Wu clearly appeared as though he did not expect Yao Lao&#x2019;s strength. After chasing spiritual bodies for so many years, he had seldom failed. Hence, regardless of how strong those spiritual bodies were when they were alive, once they lost their physical body, they would appear to be like fierce tigers that had lost their fangs in the eyes of their &#x2018;Hall of Souls&#x2019;. These spiritual bodies were entirely under the control of them. After this continued for a long time, it was unavoidable that they would have difficulty taking any of those spiritual bodies seriously. This time around, he had ended up paying a hefty price because of his underestimation.</p><p>The attacks that Yao Lao used were all fatal moves. His attacks were skillful and vicious. Under his nearly perfect control, the &#x2018;Bone Chilling Flame&#x2019; caused Protector Wu to have problems keeping track of it. There were even a couple of times when the &#x2018;Heavenly Flame&#x2019; came close to him. If not for his strong strength, it was likely that the &#x2018;Bone Chilling Flame&#x2019; would have invaded his body and vigorously destroy it earlier.</p><p>However, despite him being able to occasionally dodge the attack, Protector Wu descended into a greater disadvantage following Yao Lao&#x2019;s increasingly sharper attacks. In the end, he was actually only able to defend and could no longer split his attention to launch a counterattack against Yao Lao.</p><p>Protector Wu&#x2019;s heart was filled with anger from the humiliation in the face of this situation in which he was becoming increasingly more disadvantaged. This was the first time he had been forced to such a miserable state after capturing spiritual bodies all these years. If this were to be transmitted back to the &#x2018;Hall of Souls&#x2019;, it was likely that those fellows who had been eyeing his position for a long time would trumpet this matter. The hall leader might really end up removing his protector position in his intolerance. He would really be somewhat miserable that way.</p><p>Protector Wu clenched his teeth violently as this thought flashed across his heart. Over ten dark-black chains suddenly surged out from his body and immediately pierced toward Yao Lao from all directions. From the looks of his manner, it seemed that he wanted to engage in a desperate fight.</p><p>Xiao Yan put down the large rock that was suspended in his heart after seeing that Yao Lao had already successfully obtain the upper hand in the battle. He raised his gaze and placed his mind entirely on the enormous green-colored tornado that had agglomerated in the distance. What he needed to do now was kill this old fellow Yun Shan and end the various grudges from the past.</p><p>The somewhat illusionary blackish-green wings on Xiao Yan&#x2019;s back were flapped slightly, suspending Xiao Yan&#x2019;s body steadily in the sky. An instant later, he gently raised his hand and the three different colored fire lotus was slowly raised in front of the numerous gazes focusing on it in the open ground.</p><p>Yun Shan, whose body was hidden within the enormous tornado, saw this action of Xiao Yan in the distance and felt his heart slightly tighten. He let out a low cry in his heart and all the surging Dou Qi within his body flowed out, causing the enormous tornado&#x2019;s color to become even deeper.</p><p>Xiao Yan shook his somewhat giddy head as a result of the over exhaustion of his Spiritual Strength. He silently gasped in his heart. It seemed that he could not delay any longer. He could rely on the &#x2018;Flame Mantra&#x2019; to recover his exhausted Dou Qi but he could only slowly recuperate his Spiritual Strength. If he did not swiftly finish off Yun Shan today, it was likely that he would be the first to end up falling unconscious.</p><p>This thought flashed across Xiao Yan&#x2019;s heart as a ruthless glint flashed through Xiao Yan&#x2019;s somewhat blurry vision. Both of his hands suddenly began to move.</p><p>Following the change in the seal on Xiao Yan&#x2019;s hands, the three different colored fire lotus suspended in front of Xiao Yan immediately unleashed a glaring three different colored strong glow as it hung in the sky like a bright sun.</p><p>&#x201C;Go!&#x201D;</p><p>Xiao Yan flicked his finger as he suddenly let out a stern cry!</p><p>The three different colored lotus flame that was slowly rotating immediately turned into a blurry ray of light that rushed out in a lightning-like manner when his cry sounded.</p><p>Although the fire lotus contained a majestic, frightening, wild, violent energy, it was unusually quiet when it cut through the air. It did not even cause the slightest energy ripple. However, it was this completely silent manner that caused a chill to appear in people&#x2019;s hearts.</p><p>Yun Yun&#x2019;s eyes, as she stood by the wedding stage, remained unblinking as she looked at the blurry light figure that flashed across the sky. Although her Dou Qi was sealed, her perception as a Dou Huang was still present. Hence, she sensed a little of the terrifying energy within that fire lotus. Some panic and uneasiness immediately surged onto her pretty face. Her delicate jade-like hands were tightly clenched. In her heart, she clearly knew that Xiao Yan and Yun Shan had used their true killing moves. Next, it was likely going when the victor of this fight would be determined!</p><p>The fire lotus rushed through the sky in front of a countless number of eyes that contained various emotions. Finally, it was like a tiny falling star as it collided with the enormous tornado that was rotating in a crazy manner.</p><p>The tiny size of the fire lotus was on a completely different scale compared to that enormous tornado. That collision was just like a bird colliding into a mountain wall, an act that would not cause the latter to tremble even a little. However, not everything could be merely judged by its size&#x2026;</p><p>&#x201C;Boom!&#x201D; &#x201C;Boom!&#x201D; A loud sound was transmitted over&#x2026;</p><p>The fire lotus collided head on with the enormous tornado and a cold indifferent sound immediately resounded over the sky like thunder!</p><p>Bang! Bang! Bang!...</p><p>The sound resonated across the sky. Soon after, a three colored firework suddenly erupted in the tornado. A shocking explosion that was enough to make one completely deaf suddenly reverberated across the sky.</p><p>The explosion resounded across the sky. An extremely frightening energy storm instantly swept out from the point where the tornado and the fire lotus collided. It immediately spread over a radius of a hundred meters!</p><p>Under this kind of frightening energy storm, everyone present, including Yao Lao and Protector Wu, who were engaged in a desperate fight, became extremely surprise. Their eyes revealed a horror and an astonishment as they suddenly turned their heads.</p><p>&#x201C;It is really unexpected that an &#x2018;Angry Buddha Lotus Flame&#x2019; that is formed from the merger of three kinds of &#x2018;Heavenly Flame&#x2019; would have a strength that was actually this terrifying&#x2026; God! Just what kind of dreadful Dou Skill did this little fellow create?&#x201D;</p>
