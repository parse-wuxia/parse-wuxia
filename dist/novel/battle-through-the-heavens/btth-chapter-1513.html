<p><strong><u>Chapter 1513: Xiao Chen&#x2019;s Intervention</u></strong></p><p>Xiao Yan reached out with his hand in front of the many pairs of eyes while he stood in the sky. Subsequently, he firmly grabbed the black light pillar with his hand. The moment his hand touched the light pillar, he was able to sense a slight heartbeat being emitted from within. This heartbeat seemed as though there was a living creature within the light pillar&#x2026;</p><p>&#x201C;This Purifying Demonic Lotus Flame has actually reached such a level. It is really no different than an ordinary human.&#x201D;</p><p>Surprise flashed across Xiao Yan&#x2019;s heart as he sensed the heartbeat being emitted from the Purifying Demonic Lotus Flame sealed in the light pillar. He was about to quickly turn around and withdraw when the surrounding space suddenly began to fluctuate. A figure broke out of this space. His large hand was extended and all of Xiao Yan&#x2019;s paths of retreat were sealed.</p><p>&#x201C;The Purifying Demonic Lotus Flame is not something that you can take!&#x201D;</p><p>Xiao Yan&#x2019;s heart quivered after hearing this dense cry appear beside his ear. &#x201C;Chief of the Hall of Souls? This fellow has recovered really quickly!&#x201D;</p><p>Xiao Yan swiftly lifted his head while feeling shocked. He could see the chief of the Hall of Souls pouncing over like an enormous eagle. A dark-black Dou Qi quietly gathered on his hand before it ruthlessly grabbed toward Xiao Yan&#x2019;s head. From the looks of it, he was intent on delivering a fatal strike.</p><p>The speed of the chief of the Hall of Souls was as quick as lightning. Adding to the stillness of the surrounding space, Xiao Yan was unable to dodge at this moment.</p><p>&#x201C;There is no demonic flame, but there is a fire lotus. I shall give it to you!&#x201D;</p><p>Xiao Yan did not panic at this critical moment. His many years of training had allowed him to experience all sorts of situations. It was impossible for him to lose himself to panic because of the chief of the Hall of Souls. His body pulled back while an extermination-like energy fluctuation suddenly appeared from his sleeve. Xiao Yan&#x2019;s sleeve was suddenly turned into dust due to this fluctuation. A five-colored fire lotus appeared in Xiao Yan&#x2019;s palm!</p><p>The five-colored fire lotus was an Extermination Fire Lotus made up of five genuine Heavenly Flames!</p><p>Xiao Yan did not slight an opponent as strong as the chief of the Hall of Souls. He had used his strongest attack as his first strike. It was fortunate that Xiao Yan&#x2019;s strength had soared. Otherwise, he would not have been able to perfectly merge five types of Heavenly Flames in such a short amount of time.</p><p>After the fire lotus was formed, Xiao Yan&#x2019;s expression remained indifferent as he stared at the rapidly growing human figure in front of his eyes. At this moment, his heart had become unusually calm. The lightning fast figure of the chief of the Hall of Soul gradually became clear in his eyes.</p><p>&#x201C;I&#x2019;ll give it to you!&#x201D;</p><p>The chief of the Hall of Souls was so fast that it was terrifying. In a flash, he had appeared in front of Xiao Yan. At this moment, Xiao Yan&#x2019;s body tensed like a pulled bow. It erupted in an instant and the Extermination Fire Lotus in his hand was thrown in front of the hall chief.</p><p>&#x201C;Explode!&#x201D;</p><p>A ruthlessness flashed across Xiao Yan&#x2019;s eyes as he tossed the fire lotus out. He did not pull back. Instead, he explode the Extermination Fire Lotus. The speed of the chief of the Hall of Souls was too quick. As long as the chief of the Hall of Souls was given the time to catch his breath, he might be able to escape the area where the fire lotus was the strongest.</p><p>&#x201C;Lunatic!&#x201D;</p><p>Xiao Yan&#x2019;s act of risking it all caused the chief of the Hall of Souls to furiously curse. His body finally revealed some signs of sluggishness as it suddenly shot back. However, the fire lotus exploded while he did&#x2026;</p><p>&#x201C;Bang!&#x201D;</p><p>A loud shocking sound caused one&#x2019;s ears to become momentarily deaf as it echoed through the distant sky. The sky seemed to have sank into a mysterious silence after that extremely powerful noise was emitted. A ten-thousand-foot-large fire storm swept over the sky. One side of the storm was connected to the sea of magma below while the other extended to the sky itself. It seemed as though space itself had emitted a cracking sound from not being able to bear the strength of the rotating storm&#x2026;</p><p>Many stunned eyes watched this storm. They were as tiny as ants beneath this large and overbearing firestorm&#x2026;</p><p>&#x201C;This person&#x2026;&#x201D; Hun Feng&#x2019;s expression was a little grave as he stared at this firestorm. Even at his full strength, he might not be able to receive such a terrifying attack.</p><p>&#x201C;Will anything happen to the hall chief?&#x201D; The deputy hall chief of the Hall of Souls flashed down and asked in a deep voice.</p><p>&#x201C;The strength from the merger of Heavenly Flames might be quite strong, but Xiao Yan&#x2019;s actual strength is far too weak. It will not be an easy matter to kill the hall chief.&#x201D; Hun Feng faintly replied. &#x201C;Prepare yourself. We will immediately act and snatch the Purifying Demonic Lotus Flame once we have the opportunity to do so!&#x201D;</p><p>The deputy chief of the Hall of Souls nodded. His eyes observed the sky with caution.</p><p>The enormous firestorm raged for ten minutes before it gradually scattered. A hundred-thousand-foot-large seemingly bottomless pit appeared in the sea of magma below after the storm scattered. Looking from a distance, it appeared like the large mouth of an unfathomable demon&#x2026;</p><p>&#x201C;Chi!&#x201D;</p><p>The space a short distance away became distorted after the firestorm disappeared. Two figures appeared. One was a somewhat pale Xiao Yan while the other was Zi Yan.</p><p>&#x201C;You are really too crazy. If you ended up getting caught in it, you would also have been destroyed by the fire lotus&#x2026;&#x201D; Zi Yan parted a lock of purple hair in front of her forehead as she glared at Xiao Yan and furiously chided him.</p><p>Xiao Yan smiled, but he did not say anything. He lifted his head and scanned the spot where the firestorm had disappeared. There was a human figure stepping through the empty air and slowly walking away from that spot.</p><p>&#x201C;He is indeed not dead, huh&#x2026;&#x201D;</p><p>Xiao Yan involuntarily shook his head upon seeing this human figure. He appeared somewhat disappointed.</p><p>&#x201C;No wonder you are someone who has managed to cause my Hall of Souls to repeatedly fail. You do deserve to be looked at in a better light.&#x201D; The human figure slowly walked out of the smoke and revealed a pale face. That figure was surprisingly the chief of the Hall of Souls. He had managed to survive the Extermination Fire Lotus, but from the hint of blood on the corner of his mouth, he was not in a good state after suffering such a fire lotus strike.</p><p>&#x201C;Swoosh swoosh!&#x201D;</p><p>The expressions of Xun Er&#x2019;s group changed when they saw that the chief of the Hall of Souls was still alive. They quickly moved their bodies and surrounded Xiao Yan. Their eyes cautiously stared at the hall chief in the process.</p><p>&#x201C;Do the both of you think that you have fully grasped my strength when we cooperated earlier? If that is really the case, the both of you might perhaps be shocked now&#x2026;&#x201D;</p><p>The chief of the Hall of Souls glanced at Xun Er&#x2019;s group. After which, his eyes paused on both Zi Yan and Gu Nanhai. He gave a strange smile before lifting his hands and gently forming a seal. Following the formation of this hand seal, the aura of the hall chief suddenly soared in front of many shocked pairs of eyes. Within a short dozen plus seconds, he had broken through the barrier of the advanced fourth star of the Dou Sheng class and vaguely reached the initial fifth star of the Dou Sheng class!</p><p>&#x201C;Five star Dou Sheng?&#x201D;</p><p>The expression of Xiao Yan&#x2019;s group immediately became ugly upon sensing the aura of the chief of the Hall of Souls, which had suddenly become powerful. This hall chief had been hiding his strength?</p><p>&#x201C;You dare to intervene even after reaching the fifth star of the Dou Sheng class? Looks like you have treated the agreement between the ancient clans as nothing&#x2026;&#x201D; Gu Nanhai spoke in a deep voice. If the chief of the Hall of Souls had merely been an advanced four star Dou Sheng, there was no need to fear him if he cooperated with Zi Yan. However, if the other party was a five star Dou Sheng, the both of them would have little chance of a victory&#x2026;</p><p>&#x201C;Ha ha, I have merely luckily taken half a step into the fifth star of the Dou Sheng class. Honestly speaking, I am not really a five star Dou Sheng. Hence, the agreement has not been broken&#x2026;&#x201D; The chief of the Hall of Souls faintly smiled. After which, he stepped through empty space without uttering any unnecessary words as he slowly walked toward Xiao Yan&#x2019;s group. &#x201C;Hand over the demonic flame essence.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;In your dreams!&#x201D;</p><p>Zi Yan&#x2019;s eyes were slightly cold. She took a step forward and golden light surged. It agglomerated into a large golden dragon that wildly shot toward the chief of the Hall of Souls.</p><p>&#x201C;Shatter!&#x201D;</p><p>However, the chief of the Hall of Souls slowly shook his head when he sensed Zi Yan&#x2019;s attack. He pressed his finger gently against the air. One saw the big golden dragon burst apart when it was a hundred feet in front of him.</p><p>&#x201C;Hmph!&#x201D;</p><p>Zi Yan softly moaned and staggered back since she had a connection to the exploding golden dragon.</p><p>Everyone involuntarily felt their expressions change when they saw Zi Yan suffer a serious injury from just one strike. The gap between a five star Dou Sheng and an advanced four star Dou Sheng was this wide. If this had occurred earlier, the chief of the Hall of Souls would not have been able to defeat Zi Yan with such ease&#x2026;</p><p>&#x201C;Both Zi Yan and I are exhausted. It seems that this fellow has been able to recover extremely quickly. Even if both Zi Yan and I are to work together, we will still not be a match for him.&#x201D; Gu Nanhai stated in a deep voice.</p><p>&#x201C;Although an Ancient Void Dragon is extremely powerful, attempting to challenge someone of a high level is difficult&#x2026; hand over the demonic flame essence. This chief shall allow all of you to leave in peace on account of our cooperation earlier.&#x201D; The chief of the Hall of Souls placed both of his hands behind him. Hun Feng and the deputy hall chief had rushed behind him. Their eyes were sinister as they stared at Xiao Yan&#x2019;s group.</p><p>Xiao Yan&#x2019;s eyes flickered. Veins appeared on his arm as he tightened his grip on the black light pillar. The chief of the Hall of Souls was too strong. Even using the Extermination Fire Lotus had not seriously injured him, but it was impossible for Xiao Yan to abandon the demon flame essence!</p><p>&#x201C;I have long since heard that you are as cunning as a fox. However, this chief will not give you an opportunity to escape today!&#x201D;</p><p>The chief of the Hall of Souls merely laughed while Xiao Yan&#x2019;s eyes flashed. He suddenly stepped through empty air as his body slipped by a couple of people in a ghost-like fashion. He appeared in front of Xiao Yan as his palm reached for the top of Xiao Yan&#x2019;s head.</p><p>&#x201C;Young fellow, die!&#x201D;</p><p>The chief of the Hall of Souls unleashed his full strength with this attack. An ordinary person only saw space fluctuate before the hand of the hall chief was only an inch away from the top of Xiao Yan&#x2019;s head.</p><p>&#x201C;How can my descendant be killed just because you say so?&#x201D;</p><p>A skinny hand suddenly appeared above Xiao Yan&#x2019;s head just as the chief of the Hall of Souls was about to grab Xiao Yan. A finger was flicked and the hand of the hall chief was sent flying. At the same time, a somewhat hoarse voice slowly echoed across the re</p>
