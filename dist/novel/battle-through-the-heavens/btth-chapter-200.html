<p><strong><u>Chapter 200: Green Lotus Core Flame</u></strong></p><p>&#x201C;Green Lotus Core Flame?&#x201D;</p><p>Hearing Yao Lao&#x2019;s voice, Xiao Yan&#x2019;s mind recalled some of the information about the &#x2018;Heavenly Flames&#x2019; on the &#x2018;Heavenly Flame&#x2019; ranking that Yao Lao had once told him.</p><p>&#x201C;&#x2018;Green Lotus Core Flame&#x2019; is nineteenth on the &#x2018;Heavenly Flame&#x2019; ranking. It is formed deep underground and has experienced the polishing, fusion, pressure, and carving from the planet&#x2019;s flame&#x2026; It forms a spirit in ten years, takes shape in a hundred years and turns into a lotus in a thousand years. When it is completely formed, its color would slant toward the greenish side and the lotus core would form a cluster of green flame, named as &#x201C;Green Lotus Flame&#x2019; or &#x2018;Green Lotus Core Flame&#x2019;. The strength of this flame is unpredictable. When it is near volcanoes, it can cause volcanoes to erupt, forming a mayira; destructive strength.</p><p>This information swiftly flashed in Xiao Yan&#x2019;s mind. A wild joy instantly covered his face. Shaking his body, Xiao Yan pulled away from the Flame Spirit Serpent as his eyes stared intently at the large rich green light a short distance away.</p><p>&#x201C;Hiss&#x2026;&#x201D; Beside him, a sharp sound was emitted from the Flame Spirit Serpent. Xiao Yan turned around and found that within this huge beast&apos;s eyes, there was a faint fear as it stared at the cluster of green light. Its huge body also shrank and trembled.</p><p>Ignoring the Flame Spirit Serpent&#x2019;s action, Xiao Yan licked his lips and said excitedly in his heart, &#x201C;Teacher! Have we found it?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Ke ke, it looks like it. How unexpected, we really found a &#x2018;Heavenly Flame&#x2019;... although the &#x2018;Green Lotus Core Flame&#x2019; is only ranked nineteenth on the &#x2018;Heavenly Flame&#x2019; ranking, it is the perfect flame for you now. After all, the few things that I have prepared for you can only increase the chances of success for absorbing &#x2018;Heavenly Flames&#x2019; that are ranked sixteenth and below. Thus, this &#x2018;Green Lotus Core Flame&#x2019; is suitable!&#x201D; Yao Lao&#x2019;s laughter held signs of being pleased. There was finally the first reward for these few years of hard work.</p><p>Inhaling a few long excited breaths, Xiao Yan could not wait any longer as he said, &#x201C;Shall we go over and take a look?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Yes, let&#x2019;s go and take a look. I will increase the degree of protection!&#x201D;</p><p>Xiao Yan nodded his head. His gaze glanced at the Two-Headed Flame Spirit Serpent that was so afraid that it did not dare take another step forward. Xiao Yan curled his lips and kicked his feet within the magma. Like a small fish in a lake, his body swiftly swam toward the region that was covered by the green colored light.</p><p>As the distance between his body and the green colored flame decreased, Xiao Yan could clearly feel that the temperature around him had suddenly increased.</p><p>Closing his somewhat dry lips tightly, Xiao Yan clenched his teeth and took another step. His body finally charged into the region covered by the green colored light.</p><p>As his body entered the green colored light, he realized that it was not as hot as he had imagined. Instead, the surrounding temperature had strangely decreased drastically.</p><p>Regarding this somewhat strange phenomenon, Xiao Yan&#x2019;s face was completely stunned. A moment later, he finally recovered as his gaze hurriedly swept across his surroundings. Finally, he was looking at the green colored lotus at the middle.</p><p>The green colored lotus had eight leaves. These eight green colored leaves were like the most perfect green jade that was naturally formed. At a glance, it appeared crystal clear, giving people a desire to hold and not release it.</p><p>Within the lotus, there seemed to be a small lotus platform that was around two to three feet. A small fluorescent light was emitted from some small holes on the lotus platform. This light appeared to be coming from lotus seeds that were formed from the purest fire type energy agglomerating together.</p><p>On the lower portion of the green colored lotus, there was a very narrow and long stem and root. The stem and root were covered with extremely tiny tentacles. As these tentacles were swaying around, Xiao Yan could clearly feel their greed, unrestrainedly absorbing the surrounding wild fire type energy.</p><p>This green colored lotus was simply suspended in this never ending magma. It was like a duckweed on the vast ocean, wandering everywhere. If Xiao Yan did not have the Flame Spirit Serpent to lead the way, he would not have been able to search for this comparatively small green colored lotus in this enormous crypt with his ability, even if he were to search till death&#x2026;</p><p>&#x201C;Be careful. Don&#x2019;t get caught by those tentacles. Otherwise the Dou Qi in your body will be completely absorbed in the blink of an eye.&#x201D; Yao Lao warned, causing Xiao Yan to quickly abandon his thought of going closer to take a look.</p><p>&#x201C;Let&#x2019;s go. Be careful as you go over. Looking at the shape of the lotus, it obviously had lived through many thousands of years. It should have already agglomerated and formed the &#x2018;Green Lotus Core Flame&#x2019;.&#x201D; Yao Lao said with a smile.</p><p>&#x201C;Yes.&#x201D; At this moment, Xiao Yan&#x2019;s body was so excited that it trembled. His crossed his hands and bafflingly prayed. He then swallowed his saliva as his body gradually swam toward the green colored lotus.</p><p>As his distance from the green colored lotus grew closer, Xiao Yan could feel its beauty. This kind of thing that was so close to perfection could only be created from being honed by nature for a long period of time.</p><p>Carefully avoiding the swaying tentacles, Xiao Yan slowly arrived at a spot above the green lotus. His excited gaze swept through its interior and his body suddenly stiffened&#x2026;</p><p>In the middle of the small lotus platform within the lotus, there was a small hole around the size of a fist. However, at this moment&#x2026; that hole was empty!</p><p>Seeing that empty lotus core, Xiao Yan&#x2019;s head immediately became dim. He muttered, &#x201C;How can this be? Why isn&#x2019;t it there? From the shape of this green lotus, it should have formed the &#x2018;Green Lotus Core Flame&#x2019; long ago.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Why is it not here?&#x201D; The corner of Xiao Yan&#x2019;s mouth twitched. He was briefly silent. Suddenly, he began yelling loudly at the lotus platform. His young and handsome face appeared a little hideous at the moment.</p><p>&#x201C;Quiet! Calm down now!&#x201D; Just as Xiao Yan lost his sense of reasoning in anger, Yao Lao&#x2019;s deep cry appeared like a clock chime in his head.</p><p>&#x201C;If there isn&#x2019;t, then we&#x2019;ll just have to continue to look for it. The Dou Qi continent is so big. It&#x2019;s not like the &#x2018;Heavenly Flame&#x2019; is only present here!&#x201D; At the space where Xiao Yan&#x2019;s shoulder was at, Yao Lao&#x2019;s head that was formed by the cohesion of the thick white flames reprimanded.</p><p>&#x201C;But&#x2026; but I spent so much effort&#x2026; do I just end up going back empty handed?&#x201D; Xiao Yan violently swung his head and said in an extremely dissatisfied manner.</p><p>&#x201C;In this world, there are thousands and thousands of people persevering and searching for a &#x2018;Heavenly Flame&#x2019;. But after paying the ultimate price, they never even get to see what a &#x2018;Heavenly Flame&#x2019; looks like. Many people would envy you for being able to reach this place.&#x201D; Yao Lao softly comforted. He turned around, eyed the empty lotus core and sighed gently in his heart. It was a lie if he said that it was not disappointing. The &#x2018;Heavenly Flame&#x2019; that he thought he could easily obtain had suddenly bafflingly grown wings and escaped. If he did not have such a strong mental strength, he might have already lose his temper.</p><p>&#x201C;Huh? What is this?&#x201D;</p><p>As his gaze swept the lotus platform in detail, Yao Lao suddenly let out a surprised sound. He waved the hand that was covered in a thick white flame. Instantly, a seven colored light shot out from the lotus platform and fell into Yao Lao&#x2019;s hand.</p><p>&#x201C;What is this thing?&#x201D; Tilting his head in a listless manner, Xiao Yan eyed the thing in Yao Lao&#x2019;s hand. He stilled slightly and said in a stunned voice, &#x201C;Scale?&#x201D;</p><p>The thing in Yao Lao&#x2019;s hand was about half a palm in size. Its entire body was covered in seven colors. Glancing at it, the luster from the seven colors was beautiful and colorful.</p><p>&#x201C;This is&#x2026; a Seven-Colored Snake Scale?&#x201D; Yao Lao squinted his eyes as a cold smile was lifted from the corner of his mouth.</p><p>&#x201C;Seven-Colored Snake Scale?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;I was wondering why there isn&#x2019;t any &#x2018;Green Lotus Core Flame&#x2019; in the lotus. It was actually taken by someone else.&#x201D; Yao Lao threw the Seven-Colored Snake Scale toward Xiao Yan and laughed coldly.</p><p>Xiao Yan received the scale and felt the spot on his hand which came into contact with it turn cold. Waves of cold air continued to enter his body. If Xiao Yan did not have the protection from Yao Lao&#x2019;s &#x2018;Bone Chilling Flame&#x2019;, he would likely not even dare to touch this thing.</p><p>&#x201C;Did the owner of this scale take the &#x2018;Green Lotus Core Flame&#x2019; away?&#x201D; Xiao Yan said with a frown as he tightly held the Seven-Colored Scale.</p><p>&#x201C;There is only one person in the entire Tager Desert who possesses the Seven-Colored Scale. That is the Queen Medusa from the Snake-People Race. Looks like the mysterious Qi Qing Lin sensed from half a year ago should be that of Queen Medusa&#x2019;s.&#x201D; Yao Lao voiced his thoughts.</p><p>&#x201C;Ugh. So what if it is her? It has been half a year. The &#x2018;Green Lotus Core Flame&#x2019; must have been absorbed by her&#x2026;&#x201D; Thinking of this possibility, Xiao Yan immediately said dispiritedly.</p><p>&#x201C;You have really become muddle headed&#x2026; Queen Medusa has the Snake-People blood flowing in her body. She is naturally inclined toward the dark and cold. Absorbing the &#x2018;Heavenly Flame&#x2019;? Has she become tired of living?&#x201D; Hearing this, Yao Lao threw a look of disdain at Xiao Yan as he reprimanded.</p><p>&#x201C;Since her attributes clash with the &#x2018;Heavenly Flame&#x2019;, then did she have nothing better to do then to come here and snatch the &#x2018;Heavenly Flame&#x2019;? Moreover, Qing Lin had said that she was even injured when she took the &#x2018;Heavenly Flame&apos; away? Why would she spend so much effort if she did not have a reason?&#x201D; Xiao Yan laughed bitterly.</p><p>&#x201C;That may be so&#x2026;&#x201D; Yao Lao waved his hand and voiced his thoughts, &#x201C;Looks like we still have to make a trip to the inner regions of the Tager Desert. I don&#x2019;t know what exactly she wants to do but I can definitely tell you that she would not absorb the &#x2018;Heavenly Flame&#x2019;. Thus&#x2026; we might have a chance to get the &#x2018;Heavenly Flame&#x2019; again.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Go and find Queen Medusa to snatch the &#x2018;Heavenly Flame&#x2019;? She&#x2019;s of the Dou Huang class. Back then, even that Ice Huang, whose name shook the Jia Ma Empire, ended up in that miserable state because of her. For us to go and search&#x2026;&#x201D; Xiao Yan rubbed his forehead and smiled bitterly.</p><p>&#x201C;Having a target is better than us randomly running around to search. Moreover&#x2026; the one who would fight at that time would be me, not you. Although the fierce name of Queen Medusa is renowned throughout the Dou Qi continent, I am not afraid of her.&#x201D; Yao Lao curled his lips and said.</p><p>Xiao Yan bitterly smiled and could only sigh and nod his head. Immediately, his head turned with his body and prepared to leave.</p><p>&#x201C;Hey, what are you doing?&#x201D; Seeing Xiao Yan&#x2019;s action, Yao Lao appeared somewhat stunned as he said.</p><p>&#x201C;Going back&#x2026; Should I stay here and eat magma?&#x201D; Xiao Yan impolitely replied.</p><p>&#x201C;You&#x2026; you fool.&#x201D; Hearing the words, Yao Lao was immediately angered and knocked Xiao Yan&#x2019;s head a few times. His finger pointed to the green colored lotus and furiously said, &#x201C;This thing is a unique treasure that requires a thousand years in order to take shape. You child want to abandon it here?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;What?&#x201D; Xiao Yan blinked his eyes in shock. He turned around and eyed the green colored lotus and asked in a confused state, &#x201C;What use does this thing have?&#x201D;</p><p>Rolling his eyes, Yao Lao had difficulty swallowing these words of Xiao Yan&apos;s. He drew his beard and said irritably, &#x201C;This green colored lotus platform is formed from the agglomeration of the planet&#x2019;s flame for a thousand years. As long as you remove it and sit on it to train in the future, your training speed may not be able to increase by ten times but an increase of three to four times should be possible. Moreover, you can activate it using your Dou Qi when you meet an enemy and release the Core Flame contained within it. If you meet a person at the Dou Ling level, you may not be able to defeat him but you should meet no resistance when fleeing.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;And there&#x2019;s the lotus seeds in the lotus platform. This Core-Fire Lotus Seed that is known as the essence of flame spirits is something that requires a hundred years to form. If you go out and shout that you have a Core-Fire Lotus Seed, I dare to guarantee that even a Dou Huang would use all his might to exchange with you. Of course&#x2026; this is excluding those who prefer a more direct method like killing and robbing you.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;If you take any of these things out, you would turn the Jia Ma Empire into an upheaval. You child dare to refuse it?&#x201D; Having spoken until this point, Yao Lao spoke as if Xiao Yan was completely useless.</p><p>&#x201C;...&#x201D; Hearing the mouthwatering explanation of Yao Lao, Xiao Yan&#x2019;s eyes grew increasingly bright. By the time Yao Lao had finished, Xiao Yan&#x2019;s eyes were fiery red as he pounced onto the lotus platform.</p><p>&#x201C;Dammit, consider all this all interest&#x2026;&#x201D;</p>
