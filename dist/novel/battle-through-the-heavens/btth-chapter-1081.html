<p><strong><u>Chapter 1081: Kill</u></strong></p><p>After the enormous body of the Sky Poison Dragon Scorpion Beast smashed into the ground, the entire land trembled. It was as though an earthquake had occurred as numerous arm-thick cracks spread from the spot where it had landed&#x2026;</p><p>The body of the Sky Poison Dragon Scorpion Beast formed an enormous pit in the ground. The intense pain that was transmitted from its eye caused it to emit a painful roar. Fresh blood flowed out of its shattered eye like a small stream. The punch from the Earth Demon Puppet earlier had really caused it to suffer.</p><p>&#x201C;Bastard, this king will tear all of you into a thousand pieces!&#x201D;</p><p>The Sky Poison Dragon Scorpion Beast roared furiously at the sky. Its voice was filled with an incomparable amount of killing intent and fury. This very day was likely the only time he had ever become so miserable since he had taken the form of a human.</p><p>The Sky Poison Dragon Scorpion Beast widened its enormous mouth after it had let out that furious roar. Dense, blood-colored energy swiftly agglomerated. Within a short moment, it transformed into a blood-colored light pillar that was half a foot wide. The frightening energy contained within the light pillar caused the surrounding air to form waves of intense ripples.</p><p>&#x201C;Chi!&#x201D;</p><p>Its savage head was swung as the blood-colored light pillar cut through the air with a &#x2018;swoosh&#x2019; sound. It was just like reverse lightning as it rushed to the sky.</p><p>&#x201C;Be careful!&#x201D;</p><p>Tian Huo zun-zhe revealed a sober expression when he saw the blood-colored light pillar. This Sky Poison Dragon Scorpion Beast was about to go crazy. Anyone present would likely not have an easy time if they were to endure such a powerful attack.</p><p>Xiao Yan had immediately sensed danger from the blood-colored light pillar. Before Tian Huo zun-zhe issued his warning, he had activated the Three Thousand Lightning Movement. Numerous afterimages were left behind in the sky while his actual body strangely disappeared.</p><p>The blood-colored light pillar possessed a lethal force, and it appeared like a cannon attempting to blast a fly in the face of Xiao Yan, who was as slippery as a loach. Moreover, the Sky Poison Dragon Scorpion Beast had difficulty precisely controlling the attack due to the intense pain. Therefore, this blood-colored light pillar cut through the air and shot into the distant sky. After which, it disappeared from everyone&#x2019;s sight.</p><p>&#x201C;Xiao Yan, I will trap it. You should command the Earth Demon Puppet to strike its head!&#x201D;</p><p>Tian Huo zun-zhe ordered with a deep voice. His expression became a little grave after having dodged the Sky Poison Dragon Scorpion Beast&#x2019;s fierce counter attack.</p><p>&#x201C;Understood.&#x201D; Xiao Yan hurriedly nodded when he heard him. This Sky Poison Dragon Scorpion Beast was indeed very troublesome to deal with. Two experts who had both reached the strength of an eight star Dou Zong were unable to do anything to it within a short while. Moreover, this was with Xiao Yan aiding them on the side. If Xiao Yan had not destroyed the poison cloud earlier, it was likely that the current situation would have ended up completely different.</p><p>Tian Huo zun-zhe&#x2019;s face was serious. A vast and mighty Spiritual Strength surged out of his body without holding back. While his hands moved, this Spiritual Strength transformed into a thousand-foot-large invisible net.</p><p>&#x201C;Go!&#x201D;</p><p>Tian Huo zun-zhe waved his sleeves. The enormous net, formed from the Spiritual Strength, immediately whizzed down. After which, it trapped the large body of the Sky Poison Dragon Scorpion Beast.</p><p>The large Spiritual net had just made contact with the body of the Sky Poison Dragon Scorpion Beast when wave after wave of sizzling sounds appeared. This kind of spiritual net could ignore the beast&#x2019;s powerful physical body and restrain its soul&#x2026;</p><p>This sudden restraint shocked the Sky Poison Dragon Scorpion Beast. It hurriedly struggled, but no matter how it moved, the enormous spiritual net appeared just like the maggots in one&#x2019;s bones. It firmly adhered to its body, binding it firmly in the process.</p><p>&#x201C;Do it!&#x201D; Tian Huo zun-zhe sternly cried.</p><p>Xiao Yan nodded once. He curled his finger and the Earth Demon Puppet, that had remained in air, rocketed down from the sky. After which, it viciously smashed into the body of the Sky Poison Dragon Scorpion Beast like a cannonball. Its frightening forward momentum caused the beast&#x2019;s body to collapse.</p><p>&#x201C;Roar!&#x201D;</p><p>The frightening force that was transmitted from the puppet&#x2019;s body caused the Sky Poison Dragon Scorpion Beast to emit a crazy and furious roar. Its enormous tail was swung, transforming into a black glint as it shot toward the Earth Demon Puppet on its back.</p><p>Xiao Yan coldly laughed when he saw this from the sky. His hand seal changed and the fire wolf in the sky, that had been formed from the Glazed Lotus Heart Flame, rushed down with lightning-like speed. After which, it ruthlessly bit the scorpion tail that was about to strike the Earth Demon Puppet. Immediately, wave after wave of sizzling sounds appeared.</p><p>The fire wolf pounced down and caused a white fog to rise over the body of the Sky Poison Dragon Scorpion Beast. Its terrifyingly high temperature cause the beast to feel wave after wave of intense searing pain.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Under the dual suppression of the enormous spiritual net and the fire wolf, the Sky Poison Dragon Scorpion Beast was unable to move for a moment despite its large size. It could only struggle, causing the ground to tremble. Crack lines swiftly spread all over it&#x2026;</p><p>Bang!</p><p>A silver glow flashed and appeared on the head of the Sky Poison Dragon Scorpion Beast. Its bright silvery fist struck out without mercy, firmly landing on the beast&#x2019;s head.</p><p>The fighting strength of the Earth Demon Puppet was largely determined by its physical body, which had undergone many refinements. Despite its physical body being unable to use any Dou Qi, its destructive strength was still terrifying. With this punch from it, even this Sky Poison Dragon Scorpion Beast, which possessed the strength of an eight star Dou Zong, ended up emitting a miserable wail. Its body struggled, and it started to go crazier.</p><p>Waves of corrosive strength and dense blood fog swiftly flowed out of the body of the Sky Poison Dragon Scorpion Beast as it was wildly struggling to escape. The spiritual net of Tian Huo zun-zhe began to emit a &#x2018;chi chi&#x2019; sound when this strange blood fog formed...</p><p>Bang! Bang! Bang!</p><p>Xiao Yan&#x2019;s expression sank when he saw this scene. The fist of the Earth Demon Puppet was once again tightly clenched. After which, it threw one punch after another, acting like a pile driver as it mercilessly smashed into the same spot on the Sky Poison Dragon Scorpion Beast&#x2019;s head.</p><p>A &#x2018;chi chi&#x2019; sound was emitted when the strange blood fog adhered onto the body of the Earth Demon Puppet. The shriveled surface of the puppet&#x2019;s body formed some lines because of this corrosion&#x2026;</p><p>Xiao Yan&#x2019;s expression slightly changed when he sensed the transformation of the Earth Demon Puppet. It was unexpected that the poison vapor in the Sky Poison Dragon Scorpion Beast was this fierce. Even the tough physical body of the Earth Demon Puppet was unable to withstand it.</p><p>A ruthless expression flashed across Xiao Yan&#x2019;s eyes. He really did not believe that the Sky Poison Dragon Scorpion Beast would be able to turn things around in the face of this lineup of theirs!</p><p>An order was released from Xiao Yan&#x2019;s heart and a bright-silver glow erupted from the body of the Earth Demon Puppet, barely blocking the blood fog. His fist was like a great storm as it landed on the head of the Sky Poison Dragon Scorpion Beast in a crazy manner. The low, deep sounds appeared as though it was beating a drum, causing one&#x2019;s heart to tighten as it did so.</p><p>With the current physical strength of the Earth Demon Puppet, a single punch could cause an ordinary elite Dou Zong to spit out blood. However, this Sky Poison Dragon Scorpion Beast was relying on its thick hide to endure dozens of punches. Even though this was the case, the crust on the top of its head had finally cracked apart. Fresh blood wildly surged out. One could even vaguely see the whitish organs in its head&#x2026;</p><p>Along with this intense pain, the Sky Poison Dragon Scorpion Beast was shocked to realize that a helpless feeling was slowly spreading out of its heart. Its life appeared to be swiftly leaving its body.</p><p>At this moment, it finally began to feel afraid. If this continued, it was likely that he would have difficulty escaping this catastrophe!</p><p>&#x201C;Stop! What exactly do you want? I am a member of the Scorpion Dragon Tribe. They will not let you off if you kill me!&#x201D; The Sky Poison Dragon Scorpion Beast&#x2019;s single eye turned red as it furiously roared. This time around, there was an additional fear in its roar.</p><p>&#x201C;We want your Monster Core.&#x201D;</p><p>Xiao Yan faintly smiled. He did not give the Sky Poison Dragon Scorpion Beast even a moment to catch its breath. He clearly understood that if he made even the slightest mistake in the face of a Magical Beast as strong as the Sky Poison Dragon Scorpion Beast, it was likely that everything would come to naught. They had spent such a great amount of effort to capture this fellow. If it were allowed to escape, Xiao Yan would really end up losing more than he would gain.</p><p>Hence, even while Xiao Yan was speaking, the Earth Demon Puppet remained a tireless slaughtering machine as its fist viciously smashed down again and again. Each time it swung its fist, it would cause a fluctuation to spread across space. A circular invisible ripple would spread each time its fist landed. This kind of spreading force shattered the flesh on the surface of the Sky Poison Dragon Scorpion Beast.</p><p>Even with the tough body of the Sky Poison Dragon Scorpion Beast, it was somewhat unable to endure any longer after forcefully receiving so many heavy blows from the Earth Demon Puppet. An aura of death covered its heart.</p><p>In the face of this kind of feeling of death, a viciousness surged into the remaining eye of the Sky Poison Dragon Scorpion Beast that was staring at Xiao Yan. A moment later, it finally spoke in a dense voice, &#x201C;I, Mo He, shall use the bloodline of the Scorpion Dragon Tribe to swear that you will have to flee for the rest of your life while being chased by my Scorpion Dragon Tribe!&#x201D;</p><p>The final blood-red eye of the Sky Poison Dragon Scorpion Beast fell out of its face after its words were voiced. After which, it exploded. A tiny blood glow penetrated the air at a shocking speed before entering Xiao Yan&#x2019;s body in a lightning-like manner.</p><p>The speed of this blood glow was extremely frightening. Even Xiao Yan could only blink his eyes. He did not possess any ability to dodge it.</p><p>&#x201C;The Scorpion Dragon Tribe will not let you off. You will not be able to escape&#x2026;&#x201D; The Sky Poison Dragon Scorpion Beast viciously laughed. Two blood streams flowed out of its enormous eyes, giving it an extremely frightening appearance.</p><p>Xiao Yan&#x2019;s expression became gloomy. He moved his hand seal and the body of the Earth Demon Puppet immediately unleashed an extremely bright-silver glow. It gathered all of its strength before smashing its fist down!</p><p>Following this punch, one could see space crack apart. A half-foot-wide dark-black hole formed!</p><p>Bang!</p><p>The frightening punch contained a shocking strength as it ruthlessly smashed the head of the Sky Poison Dragon Scorpion Beast. Under this frightening strength, its large head let out a &#x2018;boom&#x2019; sound as it transformed into a countless number of bloody pieces of flesh!</p><p>The innumerable number of beasts lingering in the distance immediately ceased their uproar after the head of the Sky Poison Dragon Scorpion Beast exploded. A moment later, they scattered. Their fleeing speed was even faster than when they were charging here&#x2026;</p>
