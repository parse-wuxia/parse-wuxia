<p><strong><u>Chapter 942: Rank 6</u></strong></p><p>The numerous gazes on the street were immediately turned up when they heard the rumbling somber voice that was transmitted from the blue sky. Exclamations quickly sounded on the street.</p><p>&#x201C;It is actually the ancestor of the Luo clan?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;He has actually personally come? It looks like this old fellow really dotes on Luo Xiao Yao.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Looks like there will be a nice show today&#x2026;&#x201D;</p><p>While everyone was noisy, the gray and white old men became startled when they saw the person who had arrived. They hurriedly and respectfully said, &#x201C;Welcome ancestor.&#x201D;</p><p>The hearts of the two laughed bitterly while they spoke with their mouths. They never expected the eldest young lady to break her Heart Blood Jade Pendant. That thing was something the ancestor had personally made for her. She was told not to use it unless it was a critical moment. It was unexpected that she actually took this thing out over such a small matter. No wonder the ancestor had come so quickly. It was likely that he thought that this young lady had met with a life-threatening situation.</p><p>A blue-robed old man stood in the empty sky. His face was somewhat broad, giving him a mighty appearance even without the presence of anger. Clearly, he was someone who had occupied a high position for a long time. He merely nodded randomly at the greetings of the two before his gaze immediately turned to the red-clothed, young lady. He sighed in relief when he saw the purple-red fingerprint on her face. At the same time, a fury flashed across his eyes. His gaze turned to Xiao Yan&#x2019;s group as he slowly said, &#x201C;The few of you look really foreign. You should be people from outside of Horizon City, no?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Grandpa&#x2026; they are bullying granddaughter. You must seek justice for me!&#x201D;</p><p>Before waiting for Xiao Yan&#x2019;s group to speak, the red-clothed, young lady&#x2019;s small mouth immediately became deflated upon seeing the blue-robed, old man. Tears rolled down her cheeks. The grievances she had felt today were more than any previous years. Since when did a tender girl like her receive such a treatment. Moreover, the ice-cold killing intent in the Little Fairy Doctor&#x2019;s eyes also caused her to feel goosebumps all over her body. She seemed to possess a support now that she saw the old man appear. Her finger was pointing toward Xiao Yan.</p><p>&#x201C;You don&#x2019;t want your finger?&#x201D;</p><p>The Little Fairy Doctor faintly asked when she saw this action of the red-clothed, young lady.</p><p>Fear flashed across the red-clothed, young lady&#x2019;s face when she heard this. She hurriedly withdrew her hand, finally feeling a little afraid of the merciless Little Fairy Doctor.</p><p>Chi! Chi!</p><p>Quite a number of rushing wind sounds appeared during this delay. Immediately, over ten figures appeared on top of the buildings on both sides of the street. All of these people respectfully greeted the blue-robed, old man the moment they revealed themselves. After which, they saw the current situation. With some thoughts, they understood what had happened. Immediately, one of them coldly cried out, &#x201C;Your guts are really quite great for you to dare attack a member of our Luo clan in Horizon City!&#x201D;</p><p>Xiao Yan&#x2019;s expression finally began to slowly turn cold in the face of these experts from the Luo clan. Originally, he had no intention of offending the factions in this place. Today&#x2019;s matter had originally been an inconsequential little thing. However, the other party wanted to make it into such a big one. Moreover, they had repeatedly challenged his patience. Although this ancestor of the Luo clan was an elite five star Dou Zong, he did not pose much of a threat to Xiao Yan. Forget about the Little Fairy Doctor being able to fight him. His Storage Ring also possessed an Earth Demon Puppet that could contend with a six star Dou Zong. If the other party wished to push their luck, they should not blame him for being too vicious.</p><p>&#x201C;By teaching such an unreasonable younger generation, you elders are likely no better.&#x201D; The Little Fairy Doctor glanced at the middle-aged man who had spoken earlier as she coldly laughed. She took a step forward and a majestic aura that was not inferior to the ancestor of the Luo clan suddenly erupted like a mountain rising from the plains, causing the faces of a countless number of people to change.</p><p>&#x201C;An elite Dou Zong?&#x201D;</p><p>Numerous exclamations sounded in the street. Stunned gazes immediately looked back to the plain-clothed lady. It was the first time that they had seen such a young elite Dou Zong. At this moment, the face of the red-clothed, young lady paled a little. She understood just how powerful an elite Dou Zong was. Even with their Luo clan&#x2019;s strength, they were unable to easily offend one.</p><p>Compared to the shock of everyone else, the expression of the Luo clan&#x2019;s ancestor changed even more drastically. He clearly sensed that the strength of this lady was not the least bit weaker than him. There was even a strange, dark coldness within her aura. If they were to exchange blows, it was likely that he would not have a high chance of victory.</p><p>&#x201C;Dammit, since when did such an expert appear in Horizon City. This girl Xiao Yao is really becoming more and more overboard. Looks like I will need to properly discipline her in the future. Otherwise, if she were to offend an opponent that cannot be offended, it would definitely be a calamity for our Luo clan!&#x201D;</p><p>The gaze of the ancestor of the Luo clan looking at the red-clothed, young lady had suddenly become much sterner as his expression changed. Immediately, he turned his gaze and looked to Xiao Yan&#x2019;s group. His tone had become gentler without him realizing it. &#x201C;Everyone, today&#x2019;s matter is indeed Xiao Yao&#x2019;s fault. I, Luo Cheng, will apologize on behalf of her.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Hmph, the grand-daughter of a little Luo clan has actually been taught to be more unruly than me&#x2026;&#x201D; Zi Yan glanced at the ancestor of the Luo clan before snorting. She had disliked that red-clothed, young lady from the beginning. It should be known that even she had never scolded Xiao Yan in such a manner. What right did this girl, with big breasts and no brain, have?&#x201D;</p><p>The ancestor of the Luo clan turned his gaze to Zi Yan. A solemness also flashed across his eyes. Dou Huang? A Dou Huang that appeared to be around fourteen or fifteen years old? Why did this girl appear to be even more frightening than that white-clothed, young lady?</p><p>This thought flew through the heart of the Luo clan&#x2019;s ancestor. He no longer dared to look down on the other side. From the flow of his thoughts, it was difficult to reach this stage at such a young age with just talent alone. Hence, they should have an extremely powerful faction supporting them from behind. Therefore, they were people that could not be easily offended&#x2026;</p><p>&#x201C;We have been a laughing stock in front of the few of you. The old me will disciple this grand-daughter properly in the future.&#x201D; The ancestor of the Luo clan sighed awkwardly before waving his hand. He solemnly ordered, &#x201C;Bring Xiao Yao back!&#x201D;</p><p>The experts from the Luo clan did not dare to speak when they saw the somewhat ugly expression of Luo Cheng. They were not fools. Naturally, they could tell that this seemingly young group possessed an extremely strong strength. Even the ancestor was unwilling to easily offend them.</p><p>&#x201C;Looks like the suffering the girl has endured today has been for nothing, but it&#x2019;s just as well. Treat it as a lesson learned&#x2026;&#x201D; The couple of experts from the Luo clan interacted with each other. They let out a bitter laugh before flashing forward to forcefully grab the red-clothed, young lady. Aware that she had caused a lot of trouble, the red-clothed, young lady did not dare to even grumble as she allowed herself to be brought away by the few people without daring to resist.</p><p>&#x201C;Go!&#x201D;</p><p>Xiao Yan&#x2019;s expression was calm as he watched this enactment. Only after the red-clothed, young lady was brought away did he speak in a faint voice. After speaking, he headed to the outside of the street. The Little Fairy Doctor and the other two followed close behind.</p><p>Luo Cheng&#x2019;s eyes solidified when he saw this scene. Clearly, it appeared that the black-robed, young man was the one in charge of this person group. The remaining people, whether it was the white-clothed woman or the somewhat strange purple-haired little girl, all obeyed him.</p><p>&#x201C;Ke ke, this friend, may I get you to stay awhile?&#x201D; A thought appeared in Luo Cheng&#x2019;s heart as he hurriedly descended and appeared in front of Xiao Yan. After which he spoke in a smiling manner.</p><p>&#x201C;Is there a matter?&#x201D; Xiao Yan&#x2019;s footsteps paused as he randomly asked.</p><p>&#x201C;Friends, have you come to Horizon City because of the Wormhole?&#x201D; Luo Cheng smiled as he inquired. His face was quite courteous. This caused the people watching the scene to be at a loss for words. The number of people who could be treated by the ancestor of the Luo clan in this manner could be counted with one&#x2019;s fingers.</p><p>&#x201C;I am aware that the Wormhole of Horizon City has some problems. Old mister Luo has also come because of this, right?&#x201D; Xiao Yan smiled faintly and asked.</p><p>&#x201C;It is really refreshing to speak to someone who understands. The old me shall not beat around the bush. The problem of the Horizon City&#x2019;s Wormhole this time around is quite great. It is difficult to repair with my strength alone. Hence, I wish to ask this young lady to lend a hand. Is that possible?&#x201D; Luo Cheng&#x2019;s gaze turned to the Little Fairy Doctor, cupped his hands together, and made a request.</p><p>The Little Fairy Doctor did not reply when she heard this. She merely turned her eyes to Xiao Yan.</p><p>&#x201C;Reward.&#x201D; Xiao Yan uttered a simple word.</p><p>Luo Cheng was choked by Xiao Yan&#x2019;s direct request. He bitterly smiled and said, &#x201C;If the Wormhole can be repaired, the few of you will also be able to successfully enter it. Otherwise, there is no second Wormhole within a thousand kilometer radius of this place.&#x201D;</p><p>Xiao Yan shook his head. If the matter earlier had not happened, it would have been fine to lend a hand depending on the situation. However, with the experience earlier, he would really be unhappy if he did not get the other party to bleed a little.</p><p>Luo Cheng appeared to be aware of the thoughts in Xiao Yan&#x2019;s heart after seeing the way he acted. His bitter smile grew even denser. After hesitating for a moment, he finally clenched his teeth and said, &#x201C;Why don&#x2019;t we do it like this. My Luo clan is renowned for trading Monster Cores. If this young miss can really help the old me repair the Wormhole, the old me shall gift her a rank 7 Monster Core. As long as my Luo clan possesses it, you will be allowed to choose the affinity of the Monster Core and the species it belonged to. What do you say?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Rank 7 Monster Core?&#x201D; Xiao Yan&apos;s heart was attracted the moment he heard this. His finger gently rubbed his Storage Ring, and he glanced at the Little Fairy Doctor before randomly asking, &#x201C;May I know if your clan possess the Monster Core of the Sky Poison Dragon Scorpion Beast?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Sky Poison Dragon Scorpion Beast?&#x201D; Luo Cheng was startled. He mused for a moment before shaking his head and saying, &#x201C;This kind of Magical Beast is a unique beast from ancient times. It is extremely difficult to obtain its Monster Core. My Luo clan really does not possess a rank 7 Sky Poison Dragon Scorpion Beast&#x2019;s Monster Core.&#x201D;</p><p>Although Xiao Yan did not hold much hope, disappointment still involuntarily flashed across his eyes. During his disappointment, Luo Cheng hesitated for a moment before probingly asking, &#x201C;My Luo clan does not have the Monster Core of a rank 7 Sky Poison Dragon Scorpion Beast. However, it has a rank 6 one. May I know if it will do?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Rank 6?&#x201D;</p><p>The somewhat disappointed eyes of Xiao Yan earlier had suddenly become heated upon hearing these words.</p>
