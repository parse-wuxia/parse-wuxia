<p><strong><u>Chapter 1212: Fight</u></strong></p><p>Yi Chen&#x2019;s pretty face did not reveal any surprise as he watched the young figure slowly appear in front of Qiu Ling. He gently smiled and asked, &#x201C;You are that Xiao Yan?&#x201D;</p><p>Xiao Yan did not reply. His eyes were calm as he stared at this handsome man in front of him. The rich bloody scent on the Yi Chen&#x2019;s body caused his brows to slightly twitch. This person was clearly vicious. Just how much blood must his hands be dyed with in order to obtain such a powerful stench.</p><p>&#x201C;Xiao Yan, do not be provoked by him. This Yi Chen is not a friendly character!&#x201D;</p><p>Qiu Ling behind Xiao Yan slowly informed him.</p><p>&#x201C;The other party has already put up a challenge. Can I still reject the battle?&#x201D; Xiao Yan slightly smiled as he wondered aloud.</p><p>Qiu Ling was momentarily dull upon hearing this. He also understood that it was impossible to mediate this matter. Although Xiao Yan might appear gentle on the surface, the pride within his heart was quite great. It would be alright if one treated him politely. However, if one were to display a mocking enmity, the attitude that the person would receive would likely not be good.</p><p>&#x201C;Do your best, Xiao Yan.&#x201D;</p><p>A lovely laugh that caused one&#x2019;s bones to grow numb suddenly sounded behind Qiu Ling. Everyone looked over, only to see the long absent Cao Ying standing beautifully beside Qiu Ling. Her ample, extremely well-proportioned yet delicate body caused the eyes of a countless number of men to reveal a trace of fiery heat. The allure of this enchantress was really too shocking.</p><p>&#x201C;Hee hee, there is a good show today. The battle between the champion of the Pill Gathering and the demon of the Profound Sky Sect. This can be considered an extremely rare top level battle between members of the younger generation. I wonder just who will be victorious&#x2026;&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;I think that Xiao Yan will likely lose. This Yi Chen might only be at the peak of the Dou Zong class, but I have heard that this fellow has successfully escaped from some Dou Zun experts a couple of times. It is likely impossible for him to do so if he does not possess some genuine ability.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;That&#x2019;s right, Xiao Yan specializes in pill refinement after all and not in this kind of Dou Qi battle.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Chi, that may not be the case. Xiao Yan was able to remain in the Star Region for over half a year. Who dares to say that he does not possess any trump cards?&#x201D;&#x2019;</p><p>Seeing the two similarly outstanding young people in the square, the surrounding crowd immediately erupted into waves of private conversations. Clearly, they were anticipating this big battle.</p><p>A dense smile appeared on Yi Chen&#x2019;s handsome face in the face of the voices being emitted. An unusually bright-red tongue gently licked his lips. At a glance, he appeared to be just like a wild beast that was about to have its meal, causing one&#x2019;s pores to open.</p><p>&#x201C;Uncle Chen, I will represent you in the fight. This is alright, no?&#x201D; Yi Chen turned his head, glanced at Chen Tian Nan by his side, and smiled as he asked.</p><p>&#x201C;As long as you can kill this brat, the Profound Xuan Sect will definitely stand on your side during the chief selection in the future.&#x201D; A ferocious expression flashed across Chen Tian Nan&#x2019;s eyes as he spoke in a dark, dense voice.</p><p>The smile on Yi Chen&#x2019;s face became even richer when he heard Chen Tian&#x2019;s promise. He softly laughed, &#x201C;I&#x2019;ll do as you wish. Moreover, I am also extremely interested in the flesh of this Pill Gathering champion&#x2026;&#x201D; Yi Chen&#x2019;s gently stepped forward in front of everyone&#x2019;s eyes after his words sounded. After which, he walked to the middle of the square. His eyes contained a bloody glow as they stared at Xiao Yan as he said, &#x201C;One&#x2019;s limbs has no eyes during a battle. Come if you are mentally prepared. Of course, you can find an excuse and hide under the protection of the Pill Tower. If this is the case, I might not be able to do anything to you today.&#x201D;</p><p>Xiao Yan smiled upon hearing Yi Chen&#x2019;s words. He said, &#x201C;There is no need to say such provoking words. Since I have already revealed myself, I will naturally not shrink back.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Good, you are worthy of being the Pill Gathering champion. This demeanor is something that no one can compare with.&#x201D; Yi Chen laughed. However, his laughter contained a bloodiness.</p><p>Xiao Yan ignored Yi Chen&#x2019;s wild-beast-like eyes. He gently shifted his feet and walked to the middle of the square. Xiao Yan had yet to fight since he had left the star Region. If someone were to deliver himself to be a test subject, he would naturally not reject him.</p><p>The name Demon Yi was one that Xiao Yan had heard of. Moreover, from the way this person had reached the peak of the Dou Zong class at this age, Xiao Yan could tell that his fierce reputation was indeed not obtained from mere boasting. However, this person, whom others saw as holding sway among the younger generation, did not appear to have reached the stage where he could dominate the younger generation from Xiao Yan&#x2019;s point of view.</p><p>He had seen too many geniuses over the years.</p><p>&#x201C;Ha ha&#x2026;&#x201D;</p><p>The smile on Yi Chen&#x2019;s face became even richer when he saw Xiao Yan walking over. His foot stomped on the ground and an unusual force surged. Immediately, the ground trembled. The surrounding people hurriedly retreated.</p><p>Following the retreat of these people, a stone stage, around two hundred feet in size, rose from the ground. After which, it slowly came to a stop when it was five feet above the ground.</p><p>&#x201C;We will use this as the boundary. Whoever leaves it will have lost.&#x201D; Yi Chen laughed.</p><p>&#x201C;Agreed.&#x201D; Xiao Yan gently nodded.</p><p>A crimson color flashed across Yi Chen&#x2019;s eyes when he saw Xiao Yan nod. What he wanted to do was not force Xiao Yan out of the stone stage. Instead, Yi Chen wanted to kill him. The reason he was doing this was to allow Xiao Yan and Qiu Ling to relax a little. He would never stop a battle with anyone unless he saw blood. Otherwise, the name Demon Yi would really be nothing but child&#x2019;s play.</p><p>&#x201C;Relax, I will allow you to quickly forget about pain. You will thank me&#x2026;&#x201D;</p><p>A savage smile was lifted on Yi Chen&#x2019;s face as he looked at Xiao Yan a couple dozen feet away from him. Immediately, his feet stomped on the ground. One could hear a &#x2018;zoom&#x2019; sound as his body disappeared.</p><p>&#x201C;What rapid speed!&#x201D;</p><p>Waves of exclamations sounded from outside the stone stage when everyone saw Yi Chen disappear.</p><p>Xiao Yan in the arena did not move. An instant later, his eyes became chilly. A swinging kick that possessed great strength cut through the air and violently flew toward a certain space behind him.</p><p>&#x201C;Bang!&#x201D;</p><p>The leg brought about numerous afterimages as a figure strangely appeared when it landed on that space. The figure raised his hand and forcefully received this kick from Xiao Yan. After which, he let out a furious cry as his hand turned into a claw. A majestic blood-red Dou Qi surged out his body in all directions at this moment. This fellow had used all his strength at the beginning of the fight. From the looks of it, it was obvious that he intended to use his fastest speed to kill Xiao Yan.</p><p>Yi Chen&#x2019;s hand grabbed Xiao Yan&#x2019;s leg and a ferocious smile was immediately lifted on his face.</p><p>&#x201C;Allow me to try whether your flesh is different from that of an ordinary person!&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Devouring Blood Bone Transforming Hand!&#x201D;</p><p>A cold cry sounded and an extremely frightening suction force suddenly erupted from Yi Chen&#x2019;s hand. Under this suction force, the blood within Xiao Yan&#x2019;s body had become a little chaotic. It appeared as though it was about to break away his body.</p><p>Xiao Yan&#x2019;s eyes became slightly cold upon sensing this. His heart let out a cold cry and the Three Thousand Lotus Heart Flame circulated around his body. After which, it followed that suction force and surged out.</p><p>&#x201C;Chi chi!&#x201D;</p><p>Waves of white fog suddenly erupted from the hand Yi Chen was using to grab Xiao Yan&#x2019;s leg. Yi Chen&#x2019;s expression drastically changed. He hurriedly withdrew his hand and pulled back. Lowering his head, he saw that his palm had been charred black. If not for his vast, mighty Dou Qi defense, it was likely that his hand would have been crippled.</p><p>&#x201C;This is a Heavenly Flame, huh&#x2026;&#x201D;</p><p>Yi Chen&#x2019;s bright-red tongue licked his lips. His heart let out a cold snort. He aimed his hand at Xiao Yan and suddenly clenched it.</p><p>&#x201C;Blood Explosion!&#x201D;</p><p>A dense blood glow suddenly erupted from Yi Chen&#x2019;s palm when his cry sounded. Immediately, an unusual ripple spread from it.</p><p>That strange ripple spread extremely quickly. Within the blink of an eye, it had completely wrapped around Xiao Yan, who had suddenly sensed it. At this moment, the blood within his body had a boiling feeling with the intention of bursting his blood vessels.</p><p>&#x201C;This person is filled with evil skills. He does possess such ability&#x2026;&#x201D;</p><p>Xiao Yan&#x2019;s arm shook abruptly when he sensed the change of the blood within his body. A purple-brown flame swiftly surged out and wrapped around him. The unusual fluctuation scattered upon coming into contact with the Three Thousand Lotus Heart Flame.</p><p>A solemness also flashed across Yi Chen&#x2019;s eyes when he saw that Xiao Yan did not show the slightest activity. This attack of his was such that experts who had reached the five star Dou Zong level would have their blood forcefully pulled out if they were careless. However, it did not even manage to affect Xiao Yan&#x2019;s body even a little.</p><p>&#x201C;No wonder he is able to become the champion of the Pill Gathering. He does have some ability&#x2026; forget it, it is best not to let it drag on for too long. I&#x2019;ll finish him off. Otherwise some other situation might occur.&#x201D;</p><p>A bloodthirsty crimson color flashed across Yi Chen&#x2019;s face when this thought flashed across his heart. He inhaled a deep breath of air, and his hand seal suddenly changed.</p><p>Following the rapid change of Yi Chen&#x2019;s hand seal, his body gradually shrank in front of the many stunned gazes present. Waves of Blood Qi gushed out of all his pores, causing his entire being to look like a blood person. His appearance was terrifying.</p><p>&#x201C;Xiao Yan, be careful. This is the Great Blood Agglomeration Skill of the Profound Sky Sect. It relies on the evaporation of one&#x2019;s blood to temporarily strengthen oneself!&#x201D; Cao Ying outside of the stone stage became worried when she saw Yi Chen&#x2019;s appearance. She hurriedly cried out in a delicate voice.</p><p>&#x201C;Xiao Yan, it ends here!&#x201D;</p><p>The corner of Yi Chen&#x2019;s mouth revealed a ferocious smile while the Dou Qi in his body swiftly soared. Having used the Great Blood Agglomeration Skill, it was hard for him to find anyone who could match him below the Dou Zun class. It would be an easy matter to finish Xiao Yan off!</p><p>&#x201C;Bang!&#x201D;</p><p>Yi Chen&#x2019;s foot stomped on the ground. Numerous arm-thick cracks swiftly spread out. Within the blink of an eye, they had covered the entire stone stage. The space in front of Yi Chen became distorted as he once again disappeared.</p><p>Xiao Yan&#x2019;s brows twitched when Yi Chen&#x2019;s body disappeared. His feet swiftly took two steps back and a redness immediately flashed across his eyes. Yi Chen was just like a blood-red ghost that flashed and appeared in front of Xiao Yan. Yi Chen&#x2019;s five fingers formed a claw-like shape. His sharp nails were just like blades filled with a densely cold aura.</p><p>&#x201C;Hand your flesh to me!&#x201D;</p><p>Yi Chen revealed a bloodthirsty and cruel expression to Xiao Yan, who was in close proximity. Yi Chen&#x2019;s hand claw violently grabbed at the lethal point on Xiao Yan&#x2019;s heart.</p><p>&#x201C;Get lost!&#x201D;</p><p>Xiao Yan&#x2019;s eyes revealed a chill as he looked at Yi Chen, who was filled with a bloodiness. A thunder-like explosive cry erupted from the tip of his tongue. Immediately, a nine star Dou Zong aura that was boosted from the Flame Mantra and the Heavenly Flames finally erupted at this moment without holding back!</p>
