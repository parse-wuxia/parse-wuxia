<p><strong><u>Chapter 1419: Five Ban Shengs!</u></strong></p><p>&#x201C;Bodhisattva Ancient Tree?&#x201D;</p><p>Xun Er and the rest discovered the ancient tree in the distance while Xiao Yan was feeling stunned. Many exclamations were emitted from their mouths with some shock. This thing, which only existed in legends, was something that even they, from the ancient clans, had only been able to see in some ancient books.</p><p>&#x201C;What a large tree&#x2026;&#x201D;</p><p>The Little Fairy Doctor muttered. Even though they were extremely far from the Bodhisattva Ancient Tree, they were still able to sense just how enormous it was. Tree shadows spread and covered the ground, giving it the appearance of an ancient monster that stood between the sky and the earth. An extremely old and experienced feeling radiated from it.</p><p>&#x201C;The members of the Hun clan are likely already there. We should hurry up.&#x201D;</p><p>Xiao Yan suppressed the fiery heat within his heart. He waved his hand and took the lead to rush toward the ancient tree in the distance. Xun Er and the rest behind him could not be bothered with resting as they quickly followed.</p><p>Some commotion was once again transmitted from the beast tide behind after Xiao Yan&#x2019;s group moved. A couple of groups charged out in a miserable manner before they landed in this empty area.</p><p>&#x201C;That is the Bodhisattva Ancient Tree?&#x201D;</p><p>These people were still staggering on the ground when they saw the ancient tree that stood between the sky and the earth. A red color suddenly surged into their eyes. This color was reinforced when they saw Xiao Yan&#x2019;s group hurrying over. They were unable to remain still. Even the usually calm Jiu Feng frowned. He could not be bothered with resting as he commanded in a deep voice, &#x201C;Follow them!&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Understood!&#x201D;</p><p>The experts from the Heaven Demon Phoenix tribe clenched their teeth and nodded when they heard his order. Their bodies rushed forward and they hurriedly chased after Xiao Yan&#x2019;s group.</p><p>&#x201C;These people&#x2026;&#x201D;</p><p>Xiao Yan coldly laughed in his heart when he heard the sound of rushing wind transmitted from behind. He did not reduce his speed as he lifted his head and looked at the Bodhisattva Ancient Tree, which was growing larger in his eyes. A faint fear and respect rose from within his heart. No one would be able to remain calm in front of this divine being that had existed for an unknown amount of time.</p><p>Xiao Yan&#x2019;s group was extremely quick. The tens of thousands of feet of distance was covered within a short few minutes. When Xiao Yan&#x2019;s group was about a thousand feet away from the Bodhisattva Ancient Tree, a group of people suddenly appeared in their line of sight.</p><p>&#x201C;Hun Yu?&#x201D;</p><p>Xiao Yan&#x2019;s group was startled when they saw this group. These people had remained here and waited for the others?</p><p>&#x201C;Be careful&#x2026;&#x201D;</p><p>Xiao Yan softly warned. His speed gradually slowed. After which, he slowly landed a short distance behind Hun Yu. His eyes swept over the group. Subsequently, he lifted his eyes and looked at the Bodhisattva Ancient Tree a short distance away.</p><p>Being this close to the Bodhisattva Ancient Tree was undoubtedly shocking. It looked like a towering pillar that supported the sky. Its trunk radiated an ancient aura. The branches of the Bodhisattva Ancient Tree were huge and could cover half of a city. Wave after wave of rich fresh air spread from the ancient tree. This caused the sky to occasionally form many mysterious phenomenons.</p><p>Sunlight was currently scattering down from the sky. It landed on the ancient tree and gave it a somewhat crystal clear appearance. A powerful life force that shocked Xiao Yan&#x2019;s group spread over&#x2026; [a][b]</p><p>Xiao Yan&#x2019;s eyes stared intensely at the indescribable Bodhisattva Ancient Tree. The clear air caused one to feel carefree and untroubled, but he vaguely felt an uneasiness for no reason.</p><p>This uneasiness originated from Xiao Yan&#x2019;s powerful soul. He wasn&#x2019;t able to detect any immediate danger since the uneasiness that he sensed was extremely obscure. One would not be able to sense it if one did not carefully feel for it.</p><p>&#x201C;A natural treasure like the Bodhisattva Ancient Tree can be ranked top three across the Dou Qi continent. It would be impossible if it did not radiate any danger. Additionally, if this ancient tree has really survived for a countless number of years, it should have already formed its own consciousness&#x2026;&#x201D; Xiao Yan revealed an expression of contemplation. If this Bodhisattva formed a conscious and trained, it would undoubtedly be one of the most terrifying creatures within the Dou Qi continent. The people here would likely be no match for it.</p><p>&#x201C;Swoosh!&#x201D;</p><p>The sound of rushing wind followed close behind while Xiao Yan&#x2019;s group was pondering some thoughts. The Heaven Demon Phoenix tribe and the other few groups hurried over. Finally, they looked at Xiao Yan&#x2019;s and Hun Yu&#x2019;s group before slowly landing.</p><p>&#x201C;Hey, it was extremely difficult to come here. Why has everyone stopped?&#x201D; Jiu Feng slowly walked forward and faintly laughed.</p><p>Xiao Yan glanced at Jiu Feng but did not speak. On the other hand, Hun Yu, who was in front of them, turned around. His original frown was relaxed as he laughed, &#x201C;Ha ha, everyone is finally here. Since everyone&#x2019;s aim is the Bodhisattva Ancient Tree, I naturally waited for everyone.&#x201D;</p><p>Everyone present smiled when they heard his words. Those who were able to arrive were extraordinary people. They had already seen through Hun Yu. This person might appear friendly on the surface, but his very bones were filled with a ruthlessness. Those who believed his words had remained in the beast tide. They had been turned into shattered meat before being devoured into the ferocious beasts&#x2019; stomachs.</p><p>Hun Yu was indifferent when he saw everyone&#x2019;s superficial smiles. A smile still appeared on his face. He pointed to the Bodhisattva Ancient Tree behind him and said, &#x201C;This is our aim. Although we have broken through the beast tide, the most difficult thing to deal with is still the Bodhisattva Ancient Tree..&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Oh?&#x201D; Everyone&#x2019;s heart shook when they heard his words. Their eyes paused on Hun Yu&#x2019;s face.</p><p>&#x201C;There is a record on a scroll within our Hun clan that an ancestor had once come to the Bodhisattva Ancient Tree. However, contact with him was eventually lost. By the time the experts from my clan had received news, both he and the Bodhisattva Ancient Tree had completely disappeared&#x2026;&#x201D; Hun Yu laughed. &#x201C;Although I do not know what happened to that ancestor, he most likely died. It is likely that he fell to the hands of the Bodhisattva Ancient Tree&#x2026;&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Additionally, the strength of this ancestor was a Ban Sheng.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Ban Sheng?&#x201D;</p><p>The expressions of Xiao Yan&#x2019;s group changed. Even a Ban Sheng expert had gone missing because of this Bodhisattva Ancient Tree?</p><p>&#x201C;Therefore, everyone should not underestimate this Bodhisattva Ancient Tree&#x2026; the most dangerous thing during this trip will be that.&#x201D; Hun Yu slowly explained.</p><p>&#x201C;The reason that you are waiting here is because you do not wish to head there alone, right?&#x201D; Gu Qing Yang glanced at Hun Yun and remarked.</p><p>Hun Yu smiled but did not deny Gu Qing Yang&#x2019;s words. He rotated his body and slowly walked toward the enormous Bodhisattva Ancient Tree. Since everyone had arrived, they would all get to see the mysteries of this Bodhisattva Ancient Tree. Hun Yu was not afraid that the others would not follow because he understood the allure of the Bodhisattva Ancient Tree.</p><p>&#x201C;Be careful.&#x201D;</p><p>Xiao Yan&#x2019;s eyes swept over Hun Yu&#x2019;s back and the distant Bodhisattva Ancient Tree. He softly uttered those words before lifting his leg to follow. Regardless of whether Hun Yu was speaking the truth, it was impossible for them to give up so easily after spending so much to reach this place.</p><p>Everyone nodded. After which, they followed Xiao Yan. Dou Qi quietly began to circulate around his body.</p><p>Jiu Feng and the other few groups behind Xiao Yan hesitated for a moment before choosing to follow. Their thoughts were the same as Xiao Yan&#x2019;s. They had spent so much effort to arrive.</p><p>Gaps formed between the various groups as they traveled across the spacious grassy plains. They adopted a similar pace as they slowly headed toward the towering tree.</p><p>&#x201C;Young master Xiao Yan, something is not quite right with the Bodhisattva Ancient Tree. That clear air, which seems to be filled with life, hides a somewhat dark and chilly miasma. It&#x2019;s filled with many negative emotions similar to those of humans&#x2026;&#x201D; Qing Lin suddenly spoke with a grave face as the group walked closer to the Bodhisattva Ancient Tree.</p><p>Xiao Yan&#x2019;s footsteps momentarily paused when he heard her words. His eyes narrowed. He was naturally unable to sense such a thing, but Qing Lin possessed the Triple Jade-Green Snake Flower Pupils. Hence, Xiao Yan did not doubt her words, and he was able to vaguely sense the uneasy feeling from earlier become more prominent as he approached the Bodhisattva Ancient Tree.</p><p>While the caution within Xiao Yan&#x2019;s heart soared, Hun Yu&#x2019;s group at the front suddenly halted. They stood quite close to the Bodhisattva Ancient Tree. The towering, vast, lush, and green tree covered the sky above them. Only after getting this close, did Xiao Yan&#x2019;s group gradually feel an extremely obscure chill slowly seep into their bones.</p><p>Xiao Yan lifted his head. His eyes focused on the enormous Bodhisattva Ancient Tree. Its tree branches were a thousand feet in size with a bright cluster near the center. This light cluster looked like a ten-foot-large energy heart. A powerful heartbeat was vaguely emitted from the light cluster.</p><p>&#x201C;Bodhisattva Heart!&#x201D;</p><p>Many eyes gathered on the light cluster that was hidden by the body of the enormous tree. Their hearts violently pounded at this moment.</p><p>&#x201C;Crash!&#x201D;</p><p>After the words &#x201C;Bodhisattva Heart&#x201D; were emitted from the mouths of some people, the Bodhisattva Ancient Tree, which had been standing quietly within this grassland, suddenly emitted a crashing sound. Everyone watched as the tree branches twined together before being lowered. These tree branches slowly split apart upon making contact with the ground, and five expressionless figures slowly stepped away from them.</p><p>The very space around them began to fluctuate after these five figures stepped forward. A frightening pressure suddenly spread from them!</p><p>&#x201C;Elite Ban Shengs&#x2026;&#x201D;</p><p>The faces of everyone present became ugly when they sensed this pressure because they had discovered that these five figures were actually all elite Ban Shengs!</p><p>[a]What is being carved out?</p><p>[b]Mistake</p>
