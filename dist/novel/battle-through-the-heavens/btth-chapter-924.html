<p><strong><u>Chapter 924: Soul Cultivating Saliva</u></strong></p><p>&#x201C;Sky Demon Puppet?&#x201D;</p><p>Xiao Yan&#x2019;s eyes solidified as he looked at the three large blood-red words. His heart immediately carried a slight doubt as he slowly opened the bamboo scroll. Some more blood-red words, that contained a bloodthirstiness were imprinted into his eyes.</p><p>&#x201C;Sky Demon Puppet. This skill is not a Qi Method nor is it an ordinary Dou Technique. Instead, it is a puppet skill that has been passed down from ancient times. One must gather three items in order to refine the Sky Demon Puppet. A corpse, a spirit, and a Monster Core. The corpse is the device, the spirit is the guide and the Monster Core is the heart. This, accompanied by many other ingredients will ultimately form a Demon Puppet. The Demon Puppet is divided into three levels, Sky, Ground, and Man. The differences between them are determined by the ingredients and the flame used during the refinement. A Demon Puppet possesses an unending amount of strength, and does not have any emotion nor does it feel any pain. It is basically a killing machine.&#x201D;</p><p>The surprise on Xiao Yan&#x2019;s face became denser as his gaze slowly swept across the blood-red words on the bamboo scroll. This so-called Puppet skill was something that he had heard of before. However, it was unexpected that it was actually this mysterious.</p><p>When Xiao Yan&#x2019;s gaze shifted away from the final blood-red word, he also let out a long breath. His heart was extremely interested in the so-called &#x2018;Sky Demon Puppet.&#x2019; If he refined one, it was likely that he would have an additional bodyguard by his side that only obeyed his orders&#x2026;</p><p>Xiao Yan sighed and shook his his head. He handed the bamboo scroll to Su Qian and the others beside him. Their faces also revealed some surprise after they received and carefully read through it.</p><p>&#x201C;This kind of puppet skill is something that I occasionally saw in some ancient books. However, I had never come across a refining method. It is unexpected that the Old Ground Demon Ghost actually possessed such a collection. It is likely that the rank 7 fire affinity Monster Core from earlier is something that was obtained by this old fellow in order to refine the &#x2018;Sky Demon Puppet&#x2019;.&#x201D; Su Qian clicked his tongue and sighed after he finished reading the scroll.</p><p>Xiao Yan smiled and nodded. He extended his hand and took out the fiery-red Monster Core. Xiao Yan stroked it with his hand. The smile that was on his face became wider as he sensed the majestic energy contained within it.</p><p>&#x201C;However, this &#x2018;Sky Demon Puppet&#x2019; refining method does indeed show a bloodthirstiness. Taking a person&#x2019;s corpse and spirit, and then mixing them with a Monster Core. Gathering all three items and coordinating them with their own unique refining method. Perhaps the strength of the thing that is refined would really be extremely shocking.&#x201D; Su Qian shook his head and returned the bamboo scroll. He said, &#x201C;You should keep this thing. It would not be good for such a thing to appear within the academy. Since you are about to roam the Central Plains, it is more suitable for you.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Thank you First Elder.&#x201D;</p><p>Xiao Yan smiled upon receiving the scroll. He did not put on an act. This &#x2018;Sky Demon Puppet&#x2019; really interested him. Moreover, other than some of the special ingredients, he basically had all of the basic parts written on it: corpse, spirit, and Monster Core. He might really be able to refine the so-called &#x2018;Sky Demon Puppet&#x2019;.</p><p>Xiao Yan stored the bamboo scroll and the Flame Creation Skill into his Storage Ring. He looked all around him. The other Qi Methods and Dou Techniques around this place could no longer satisfy him. Only the rare medicinal ingredients that were perfectly preserved had some use to him. Hence, when he grabbed things, he also took some of the medicinal ingredients that might be useful to him in the future.</p><p>After grabbing all of the things he needed, Xiao Yan finally stopped without feeling completely satisfied. Few of the remaining things within the warehouse could meet his eyes. However, it was an enormous windfall to Xiao Gate. Xiao Gate had been established for a short period of time and had a weak foundation. It did not have many Qi Methods nor Dou Techniques for its members to practice. Now that they had raided the Demon Flame Valley stores, they were ultimately able to resolve this trouble.</p><p>Xiao Li also smiled when he saw Xiao Yan stop. He summoned some members of Xiao Gate and used some Storage Rings to move everything After which, everyone looked at the empty warehouse, laughed dryly with dark faces and left&#x2026;</p><p>After having raided the Demon Flame Valley, Xiao Yan left a couple of members of Xiao Gate to stand guard before everyone else flew toward the Inner Academy. At this moment, there were many things that Xiao Yan needed to do. Forget about the matter of refining the &#x2018;Sky Demon Puppet.&#x2019; The most important matter was to refine a kind of medicinal pill that could nourish one&#x2019;s spirit within ten days. Otherwise, if Tian Huo zun-zhe spirit quietly scattered, the fierce spirit sealed within the ring would likely rush out again. Of course, compared to fighting the fierce spirit, the most serious matter was losing the enormous help that Tian Huo zun-zhe could provide in the future. Xiao Yan clearly knew just what kind of benefit he would enjoy once Tian Huo zun-zhe&#x2019;s strength recovered. At that time, it was likely that he would have some confidence even when facing the &#x2018;Hall of Souls&#x2019; head-on. After all, according to what he knew, above the Protectors were Honorable Elders. These Honorable Elders were likely only a little lower than the mysterious Hall Chief. From this, one could tell that even the &#x2018;Hall of Souls&#x2019; had experts at the Dou Zun class.</p><p>Moreover, he was about to head to the Central Plains soon. The experts there were as numerous as the clouds. Moreover, the people who had the ability to participate in the &#x2018;Pill Gathering&#x2019; would likely not have a weak background or strength. If he did not possess some trump cards, it was likely that he would be eaten by others until even his bones disappeared. The weak were mere meat to be eaten by the strong. This was a rule that would not change no matter where one was.</p><p>Hence, Xiao Yan must prepare all of his trump cards during the remaining time. He also needed to learn more about the Central Plains in order to prepare himself mentally.</p><p>Xiao Yan entered the place where medicinal ingredients were stored after having returned to the Inner Academy. He had to grab every minute and second in order to refine the medicinal pill that nourished one&#x2019;s spirit.</p><p>Ten days time was a little tight. It was basically an impossible task to complete for the past Xiao Yan. However, it was fortunate that Yao Lao had left behind a rich collection for Xiao Yan when he was captured. This collection was full of the many medicinal formulas that Yao Lao had learned during his lifetime. With these medicinal formulas, Xiao Yan was able to find the right solution. There was no need for him to hurriedly go everywhere in search of medicinal formulas at the last minute.</p><p>A medicinal pill for the nourishment of a spirit was pretty uncommon. Hence, it was quite rare. However, Yao Lao was indeed worthy of his name as Yao zun-zhe. Xiao Yan took only an hour of searching before he finally found a suitable medicinal pill for the current Tian Huo zun-zhe from the many medicinal formulas.</p><p>&#x201C;Soul Cultivating Saliva.&#x201D;</p><p>This small thing&#x2019;s tier was not considered too high. It was coincidentally around a tier 5 pill and was not too troublesome to refine. However, the only flaw was that the medicinal ingredients required were far too unusual. It was fortunate that Xiao Yan&#x2019;s current collection was extremely rich. Additionally, the Inner Academy had a store that had been stocked for many years. Hence, it did not cause Xiao Yan too much of a headache.</p><p>After gathering the many necessary medicinal ingredients to refine the &#x2018;Soul Cultivating Saliva,&#x2019; Xiao Yan sighed in relief. After which, he summoned his medicinal cauldron. His flame slowly drifted from his hand, and began to work hard to refine a pill during the countdown of the scattering of Tian Huo zun-zhe&#x2019;s spirit. Perhaps it was because he was pressed for time but Xiao Yan&#x2019;s heart had become a little more anxious. Hence, he failed his first two attempts at refinement. However, it was fortunate that Xiao Yan had understood the source of the problem after failing twice. He slowly calmed himself down. The refinement process gradually took the right path.</p><p>The refinement this time around did not end even after continuing for three full days. Although this &#x2018;Soul Cultivating Saliva&#x2019; might not appear difficult to refine, it consumed an exceptional amount of time. After the lesson earlier, Xiao Yan&#x2019;s heart did not form any anxiety. He continued to maintain a warm flame, slowly refining the cluster of emerald-like liquid within the medicinal cauldron.</p><p>With this calm attitude, no other trouble occurred during the refinement. When the refinement reached the fifth day, Xiao Yan, who had his eyes tightly shut, finally opened them. He beckoned with his hand and a cluster of liquid emitting an emerald-like luster shot out of the medicinal cauldron. After which, it remained suspended in front of him.</p><p>Xiao Yan sighed in relief as he looked at this cluster of emerald liquid as life force permeated from it. He slowly raised his finger with the white-colored ring. The finger beckoned and the liquid drifted down. Finally, it fell on the ring and slowly seeped into it.</p><p>The white-colored ring, that had been quiet for a the last couple of days finally emitted a bright luster after this &#x2018;Soul Cultivating Saliva&#x2019; entered it. Xiao Yan was able to sense the spirit, that had laid in slumber, slowly awaken.</p><p>When the final drop of &#x2018;Soul Cultivating Saliva&#x2019; completely entered the ring, the spirit within the ring emitted some life. An old voice that was filled with gratitude could be heard.</p><p>&#x201C;Ke ke, Xiao Yan, your kindness is too great for mere thanks. This time around, you can consider the old me owing you a favor.&#x201D;</p><p>Xiao Yan let out a long breath as though he had released a heavy burden upon hearing this familiar voice. He wiped off the cold sweat on his forehead and smiled as he said, &#x201C;What is Old mister Yao saying. If you had not intervened and settled that fierce spirit, I would have been unlucky.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;I settled that fierce spirit because I wished to snatch its Spiritual Strength. Therefore, it has nothing to do with you. You need not say anything more. The old me is not someone who cannot differentiate between kindness and resentment.&#x201D; Tian Huo zun-zhe&#x2019;s laughter was transmitted from the ring.</p><p>Xiao Yan could only spread his hands upon hearing this. He would naturally not reject an elite Dou Zun owing him a favor.</p><p>Xiao Yan extended his hand and returned the medicinal cauldron to his Storage Ring. He tidied up the place a little before walking out of the warehouse. He said while walking, &#x201C;Old mister Yao has just woken up, you should rest first. There is no need to hurry over the matter of the fierce spirit.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Yes, with my current condition, it would be difficult to refine it.&#x201D; Tian Huo zun-zhe agreed with him.</p><p>Xiao Yan smiled. He pushed open the door and slowly walked in the glaring sunlight. However, he had just walked out when he saw Xiao Li pacing back and forth outside of the warehouse. He was involuntarily startled as he smiled and asked, &#x201C;Second brother, why are you here?&#x201D;</p><p>Xiao Li hurriedly turned his body around when he heard this voice. He involuntarily sighed in relief when he saw Xiao Yan walk out. His expression became solemn as he said, &#x201C;You have finally come out. Quick! Quickly go and take a look at the Little Fairy Doctor. Something has happened to her!&#x201D;</p><p>The smile on Xiao Yan&#x2019;s face suddenly stiffened. Without waiting for Xiao Li to react, he transformed into a blurry black figure that charged away in a lightning-like manner. Xiao Li smiled bitterly and sighed before quickly following the figure.</p>
