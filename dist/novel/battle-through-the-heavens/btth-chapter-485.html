<p><strong><u>Chapter 485: Green Ganoderma Fire Spirit Ointment, Swift Wind Spirit Pill</u></strong></p><p>After parting ways with Lin Yan, Xiao Yan hurried to the &#x2018;Blazing Sky Qi Refining Tower&#x2019; located on the northern side of the Inner Academy. The doors to the tower had long been opened by this time. Thus, it saved him some waiting time.</p><p>Xiao Yan did not stay in the first level for long after he entered the tower. Instead, he directly went to the second level. Perhaps it was because there were more people training during the day, but all the high and middle grade training rooms in the second level were occupied by others. Seeing this, Xiao Yan, who originally intended to head directly to the third level, mused for a moment and randomly searched for a small-sized low grade training room.</p><p>This low grade training room which Xiao Yan had found was the smallest kind of size. It could only accommodate one person within it. Moreover, from the looks of the dust that had accumulated within the training room, it was obvious that it belonged to the category of those rooms which people seldom used. After all, the Heart Flame within this kind of training room could not even be compared with some of the middle grade training rooms on the first level. Therefore, an ordinary person would not purposefully come to this kind of training room unless there was really no other place to train.</p><p>However, Xiao Yan&#x2019;s intention of searching for this kind of single person training room was not for the sake of training. He merely wanted to find a quiet place to refine some medicinal pills he needed for his retreat.</p><p>After entering the training room, Xiao Yan shut the door tightly. He did not enter that extremely small black stone platform. Instead, he sat cross-legged on the ground. With a wave of his hand, the medicinal cauldron which had just entered his storage ring a short time ago was summoned out once again.</p><p>Xiao Yan slowly closed his eyes after placing the medicinal cauldron in the proper position. He began to search the medicinal formulas that Yao Lao had given him&#x2026; five minutes after he shut his eyes, the former opened them. A faint joy was contained in his eyes.</p><p>&#x201C;Green Ganoderma Fire Spirit Ointment. The ingredients needed to refine it are a Three Leaves Green Ganoderma, Fire Lotus Fruit, Thousand Spirit Grass, Fire Affinity Monster Core&#x2026;&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Swift Wind Spirit Pill. The ingredients needed to refine it are Rapid Dragon Saliva, Night Spirit Leaf, Wind affinity Monster Core&#x2026;&#x201D;</p><p>Although the tier of both kinds of medicinal pills were not very high, they belonged to the species with extremely unique effects. The rarity of these kinds of unique medicinal formulas did not lose to that of a Sonic Dou Technique among the Dou Techniques .</p><p>The first kind, the Green Ganoderma Fire Spirit Ointment, could be rubbed on one&#x2019;s body when one trains and allowed a person&#x2019;s skin to be extreme sensitivity to natural fire energy and possessed a unique suction strength. After rubbing this kind of &#x2018;Green Ganoderma Fire Spirit Ointment,&#x2019; even if one did not voluntarily circulate one&#x2019;s Qi Method to absorb energy, the fire affinity energy between the Heavens and the Earth would still be towed and unceasingly pulled into one&#x2019;s body automatically. Of course, this kind of Fire Spirit Ointment also had one kind of drawback. It would cause the person who applied it to their skin to feel a numb and itchy feeling. If it was a person who did not have a firm mind, it was likely that the person would not be able to maintain their training state, much less absorb energy.</p><p>The second kind of medicinal pill, the Swift Wind Spirit Pill, was even rarer. It would allow a person to increase the circulation of Dou Qi within their body upon consumption. This was like adding a wild gale to a windmill, causing its circulating self to circulate much fiercer and faster. However, everything had its rules. This kind of increase in the circulation of one&#x2019;s Dou Qi was like an overdraft. Once the increase in the Dou Qi speed lasted for a while, the inside of one&#x2019;s body would descend into a sluggish period. If one were to meet an enemy during this period, it was likely that one would only be able to unleash half of one&#x2019;s strength.</p><p>The effects of the two kinds of medicinal pills were strange. Under normal circumstances, it was likely that not many people would pay attention to them. However, for the current Xiao Yan, they were extremely useful things. In this &#x2018;Blazing Sky Qi Refining Tower,&#x2019; the fire affinity energy was so rich that it left one speechless. With the help of the Green Ganoderma Fire Spirit Ointment, his absorption speed would undoubtedly be raised by a few folds.</p><p>Moreover, if the speed of circulation of Dou Qi could suddenly become faster when the Heart Flame rose in his body, it would undoubtedly increase his training speed&#x2026; Hence, it was not an exaggeration to say that these two kinds of medicinal pills were currently the things that Xiao Yan needed the most.</p><p>The tier of these two medicinal pills was not very high. Although the coordination of the various ingredients was a little strange, refining them was merely a problem of time to Xiao Yan with his current alchemist skills.</p><p>After he revised the degree of merging and the control of the fire to refine the first kind of medicinal pill within his heart, Xiao Yan flicked his finger. A wisp of green flame once again shot into the medicinal cauldron. The raging intense flame immediately caused the temperature of the training room to climb by quite a bit.</p><p>Xiao Yan sat cross-legged in front of the medicinal cauldron. He waved his hand and a pile of various medicinal ingredients appeared on the ground. His eyes stared intently at the flame in the middle of the cauldron. The green-colored flame was reflected within his dark black eyes. The dark black and green color mixed, appearing somewhat strange.</p><p>Xiao Yan&#x2019;s body did not move even a little. His expression was serious. Occasionally, he would wave his hand and a skillful wind would wrap around the medicinal ingredients on the ground and throw them into the medicinal cauldron one at a time, repeatedly undergoing refining and merging&#x2026;</p><p>The first refinement lasted for a total of nearly half an hour. Only then did it gradually end. When Xiao Yan stored a large cluster of extremely viscous red-colored paste into a jade bottle, the refinement of the first kind of medicine, the Green Ganoderma Fire Spirit Ointment, was successfully completed.</p><p>......</p><p>After the Green Ganoderma Fire Spirit Ointment was successfully refined, Xiao Yan did not start refining the second Swift Wind Spirit Pill. Instead, he swallowed an energy recovery pill and chose to sit cross-legged to recover his Dou Qi. Although refining the Green Ganoderma Fire Spirit Ointment did not consume a lot of Dou Qi, this habit had become second nature. Xiao Yan always liked to refine medicinal pills in his best condition. Being in his best condition allowed his Spiritual Perception and his degree of flame control to be in their peak states. If he refined medicinal pills at such a moment, it was undoubted that his success rate would reach its highest level.</p><p>Xiao Yan sat cross-legged and merely rested for over ten minutes before he opened his eyes with a face that revealed a faint red glow. He sensed the slightly stronger Dou Qi in his body after undergoing one round of refining medicine and involuntarily smiled. With a wave of his hand, the green-colored flame once again rose within this training room.</p><p>Perhaps it was because the Swift Wind Spirit Pill needed to be formed into a pill shape, hence the time needed for its refinement was nearly twice that of the Green Ganoderma Fire Spirit Ointment .</p><p>Over an hour later, Xiao Yan suddenly opened his tightly shut eyes. His eyes were shining as he eyed the flame rising within the cauldron. As the flame curled up, one could even vaguely see the outline of a few partially visible rounded medicinal pills.</p><p>Xiao Yan exhaled a breath of air. He flicked his finger gently and a wisp of wind shot out, opening the cover of the cauldron. He beckoned with his hands and a few pale green-colored medicinal pills flew out from within the cauldron. Finally, they were sucked into Xiao Yan&#x2019;s palm.</p><p>Xiao Yan opened his palm. Five thumb-sized pale-green-colored medicinal pills that contained some warmth lay within it. A faint medicinal fragrance was emitted from them. When he inhaled this medicinal scent, Xiao Yan sensed that the speed of the Dou Qi flowing within the Qi Paths of his body increased slightly.</p><p>&#x201C;Hee hee, they are indeed effective.&#x201D;</p><p>A joy involuntarily flashed across Xiao Yan&#x2019;s face as he sensed the increased circulation speed of Dou Qi in his body. He took out a jade bottle from within his storage ring and carefully threw the medicinal pills into it. After doing all of this, he stored the medicinal cauldron in front of him into his storage ring. He then patted his buttocks and stood up.</p><p>&#x201C;I have already prepared the things I need. Now, let&#x2019;s enter the third level and prepare to undertake a retreat to train&#x2026;&#x201D; Xiao Yan muttered in his mouth. He arranged his clothes before pushing open the door and walking out.</p><p>After exiting the training room, the coming and going human flow appeared before Xiao Yan&#x2019;s eyes. He hesitated for a moment before pulling a student walking past in front of him, and inquired about the direction in which one could descend to the third level.</p><p>Having suddenly been pulled by someone, the student felt somewhat impatient and angry. However, when he heard Xiao Yan&#x2019;s question, he involuntarily shut his mouth. One would need at least the strength of a three star Da Dou Shi in order to enter the third level to train. He weighed Xiao Yan up and down before courteously pointed in the north-west direction.</p><p>Xiao Yan voiced his thanks before he opened his stride and swiftly walked in the north-west direction. After nearly ten minutes, a spiral staircase that was similar to the entrance to the second level appeared in front of him. However, there were two men who were clearly instructors, standing at the area by the staircase. Xiao Yan saw that the students who entered it had to take out their own Fire Crystal Card before they were allowed to enter.</p><p>Doubt flashed across Xiao Yan&#x2019;s heart. As he slowly walked nearer, the two instructors glanced at him. One of them said in a faint voice, &#x201C;If you want to enter into the third level to train, you need to possess a blue-colored Fire Crystal Card, and a strength above that of a three star Da Dou Shi.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;So, they are inspecting&#x2026;&#x201D;</p><p>Xiao Yan came to a sudden understanding when he heard the words of the instructor. He took out his green Fire Crystal Card before handing it over.</p><p>&#x201C;Green Fire Crystal Card?&#x201D; Seeing the crystal card in Xiao Yan&#x2019;s hand, surprised voices were immediately emitted from the mouths of the two instructors. Immediately, they eyed Xiao Yan with astonished expressions.</p><p>&#x201C;Can I enter?&#x201D; Xiao Yan smiled and asked when he saw the astonished manner of the two of them.</p><p>&#x201C;The green Fire Crystal Card is sufficient to enter into the sixth level to train. It is naturally qualified to enter the third level.&#x201D; An instructor smiled and nodded. There was an additional politeness in his smile. No matter what kind of status one had, it was easy for a person who had great strength to receive courteous treatment from others.</p><p>Xiao Yan received the green Fire Crystal Card that the instructor returned and cupped his hands toward the latter. After which, he entered the spiral staircase and disappeared in front of many envious gazes...</p><p>&#x201C;Tsk tsk, having obtained a green Fire Crystal Card at such an age. This is the first time that I have seen such a thing in many years.&#x201D; The instructor earlier could not help but say in a surprised manner.</p><p>&#x201C;That&#x2019;s right&#x2026; but looking at his aura, he appears to be still at the Da Dou Shi class. Why would he possess a green Fire Crystal Card?&#x201D; The other instructor was somewhat uncertain. There was no more than fifty students within the Inner Academy who possessed a green Fire Crystal Card. Those people who had the qualification to possess it were mostly the experts on the &#x2018;Strong Ranking,&#x2019; and their strength were at the Dou Ling class.</p><p>&#x201C;It seems like a few new student representatives this year obtained the reward of a green Fire Crystal Card by Elder Su?&#x201D; The instructor by the side hesitated for a moment before he suddenly spoke.</p><p>&#x201C;Uh&#x2026; then that little fellow earlier&#x2026; don&#x2019;t tell me he is the person whom the First Elder instructed to give special care to&#x2026; Xiao Yan?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;It seems&#x2026; to be so?&#x201D;</p><p>The two instructors at the entrance to the third level looked at one another while feeling at a lost. A long while later, they finally nodded and smiled bitterly.</p>
