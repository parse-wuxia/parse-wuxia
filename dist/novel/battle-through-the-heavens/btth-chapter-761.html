<p><strong><u>Chapter 761: Fighting Mulan Three Elders</u></strong></p><p>Hai Bodong and the others in the fortress sighed. Medusa had already been injured. Now, she still needed to fight two people on her own. How can this situation be good? However, in this situation, who else could they rely on but her?</p><p>The big fight in the sky abruptly erupted while they sighed quietly in their hearts. Just as both parties&#x2019; energies were about to pull at each other, a faint thunderous roar whizzed down from the sky. A clear laugh mightily resounded.</p><p>&#x201C;Ha ha, how can I, the chief of Yan Alliance, be missing from this big battle?&#x201D;</p><p>A vast and mighty laugh resonated over the sky before finally spreading all over like furious rolling-thunder. It reverberated beside the ears of a countless number of people.</p><p>Xiao Ding and the others on the fortress were initially startled upon hearing this somewhat familiar laughter. A wild joy immediately surged within their eyes.</p><p>&#x201C;It&#x2019;s Xiao Yan! This fellow has finally hurried back!&#x201D; Hai Bodong could not control the excitement in his heart as he laughed out loud.</p><p>Jia Xing Tian beside him also quietly wiped off the cold sweat from his forehead. This fellow always liked to appear at the last moment. However, it was fortunate that he had made it in time.</p><p>Xiao Ding slowly sagged against the backrest of his wheelchair. He let out a long breath as he said, &#x201C;We are finally able to resolve this big battle&#x2026;&#x201D;</p><p>Everyone by his side also sighed in relief and nodded their heads. With Xiao Yan&#x2019;s ability, he would be able to block Yan Luo Tian or the three Mulan Elders if he were to unleash his full strength. Given Medusa&#x2019;s strength, it would not be difficult to defeat the remaining person. Once these two elite Dou Zongs were defeated, the morale of the Jia Ma Empire would definitely soar. They would also truly possess a trump card to contend with the three sects in the future.</p><p>That thunderous roar once again sounded while everyone was conversing. Three rays of light rushed over from the sky in front of the eyes of a countless number of people. They appeared in the air above the fortress within a short couple of breaths.</p><p>The first of the three people who had appeared was a black-robed, young man. Behind him was a lovely, pretty little girl who had long purple-colored hair as well as a female Snake-Person. They were naturally Xiao Yan, Zi Yan, and Yue Mei who had rushed over.</p><p>The fortress immediately erupted into an earth-shaking cheer as they looked at the black-robed, young man in the sky, who had arrived at such a crucial moment. Being people from the Jia Ma Empire, not a single one of them was unfamiliar with this name. Although the Jia Ma Empire had been repeatedly defeated during the big fights in the past year, many people did not give up. This was because they held a faint hope within their hearts. That was the chief of the Yan Alliance, Xiao Yan!</p><p>Many placed their hope this young man, who had repeatedly created miracles. They hoped that he would appear and lead the empire out of its plight of destruction.</p><p>Now that the person whom they had placed their hopes on in their hearts had appeared, how could these people, who had been pressured by potential destruction until they could hardly breathe, not be crazily excited?</p><p>Medusa was startled as she looked at the black-robed, young man who had flashed and appeared. A moment later, she let out a long sigh within her heart. This fellow had finally hurried over&#x2026; Medusa&#x2019;s body moved while she sighed in relief, appearing beside Xiao Yan. Her eyes swept over the latter as she asked, &#x201C;Have you broken through?&#x201D;</p><p>Xiao Yan smiled and nodded. He softly questioned, &#x201C;You are slightly injured?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;It is merely a small injury. It&#x2019;s nothing.&#x201D; Medusa&#x2019;s tone was quite careless. Her gaze glanced at Yan Luo Tian and the Mulan Three Elders who had ceased their attacks because of Xiao Yan&#x2019;s appearance. She asked, &#x201C;Do you have the confidence to stop one of them? Of course, those three old men can only be considered as one.&#x201D;</p><p>Xiao Yan smiled when he heard this. He raised his head. His narrowed dark-black pupils swept over Yan Luo Tian&#x2019;s group as he smiled and said, &#x201C;Aye. You can just relax and choose one. I will take care of the other&#x2026;&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Ke ke, what arrogant words. A mere Dou Huang actually dares to make such a bold and outrageous statement in front of us. Aren&#x2019;t you afraid of biting your tongue?&#x201D; Yan Luo Tian on the other side trembled and laughed coldly upon hearing these words of Xiao Yan.</p><p>&#x201C;Brat, who are you? I advise you not to get involved in a fight of this class. Us three Elders have seen quite a number of haughty young heroes. Unfortunately, none of them have had a good ending.&#x201D; The Mulan Valley Elder who had transformed into a tiger-headed person swept his bloody gaze over Xiao Yan&#x2019;s body. Perhaps it was because their Qi Method had bestowed them an instinct that was even sharper than others of similar class, but he kept feeling that this young man in front of them was unusual. Hence, he could only suppress the bloodthirstiness within his heart and open his mouth to speak in a dark, solemn manner.</p><p>Surprise flashed across the eyes of Yan Luo Tian by the side when he heard the words that this tiger-headed Elder said. He immediately re-evaluated Xiao Yan before speaking with a slight frown, &#x201C;Chief Yan? Are you that chief of the Yan Alliance who has been hiding for an entire year?&#x201D;</p><p>Xiao Yan&#x2019;s finger gently flicked on his sleeves. It was unexpected that his one year retreat was actually seen as miserable hiding in the eyes of the people from the three sects. It seemed that he had the duty of strengthening his name today&#x2026;</p><p>&#x201C;The two of you should withdraw first.&#x201D; Xiao Yan turned his head over and spoke to Yue Mei and Zi Yan behind him.</p><p>&#x201C;You&#x2026; can you do it? The other party is equivalent to two elite Dou Zongs.&#x201D; Zi Yan did not hesitate when she heard Xiao Yan&#x2019;s words. She turned around and rushed to the fortress. Yue Mei, on the other hand, hesitated for a moment before speaking. It seemed that from the way she saw it, even though Xiao Yan&#x2019;s strength was quite strong, his was ultimately facing an elite Dou Zong. The gap between a Dou Huang and a Dou Zong&#x2026;</p><p>Xiao Yan merely smiled and waved his hand in the face of Yue Mei&#x2019;s uneasiness. He said, &#x201C;Relax&#x2026;&#x201D;</p><p>Yue Mei could only helplessly nod her head when she saw his insistence. When she was withdrawing, her gaze swept over Medusa respectively while her heart quietly wondered why Her Majesty would trust that this fellow could handle an elite Dou Zong.</p><p>&#x201C;Leave Luo Yan Tian to me to deal with. You can block these Mulan Three Elders. Be careful, they know a combined fighting method. When they join together, they are not weaker than an elite Dou Zong.&#x201D; Medusa uttered. Her gaze turned to Yan Luo Tian on the other side after seeing Zi Yan and Yue Mei withdrawing.</p><p>Although Yan Luo Tian and the Mulan Three Elders had the strength to be able to fight against an elite Dou Zong, the former ultimately had genuine strength while the latter could only rely on their Qi Method in order to mysteriously merge their strength. If one were to compare them, the latter were undoubtedly easier to deal with. Hence, Medusa also handed this slightly easier opponent to Xiao Yan.</p><p>&#x201C;Yes.&#x201D; Xiao Yan smiled and nodded. He glanced at the three Mulan Elders. They wore three ferocious and savage beast heads over their human heads. He said, &#x201C;You can just relax and deal with that Yan Luo Tian. These three people will no longer bother you even a little.&#x201D;</p><p>Yan Luo Tian&#x2019;s face clearly trembled upon seeing Medusa&#x2019;s gaze locking onto him. He immediately laughed dryly, &#x201C;Since you wish to allow this youngling to go and court death, we will accept it reluctantly.&#x201D; He turned his head to the three Mulan Elders after saying this and spoke with a sinister voice, &#x201C;Three Elders, it should not be too much of a problem dealing with a little Dou Huang brat, right?&#x201D;</p><p>That tiger-headed Elder hesitated for a moment when he heard this. Finally, he nodded and said, &#x201C;Although this brat is a little strange, we should be able to finish him off within ten exchanges. After which, we will help you deal with Medusa.&#x201D;</p><p>Although Xiao Yan in front of them gave them an unusual feeling, the former was a Dou Huang no matter how one put it. In these many years, the number of elite Dou Huangs who were killed by their hands was something that they could not count even with two hands. Hence, they did not truly place Xiao Yan in their hearts.</p><p>Yan Luo Tian finally nodded with satisfaction when he heard the tiger-headed Elder&#x2019;s words. His gaze swept toward Medusa as he coldly laughed. A majestic Dou Qi explosively surged out from his body and the large goose wings on his back were flapped. He actually took the lead to attack Medusa.</p><p>&#x201C;Be careful.&#x201D; Medusa&#x2019;s face was serious when she saw Yan Luo Tian&#x2019;s actions. She turned her head and reminded Xiao Yan before suddenly rushing out. When her body was rushing past Xiao Yan, she clearly sensed a round object being stuffed into her palm. Xiao Yan&#x2019;s laughter sounded beside her ear while she was hesitating, &#x201C;Consume it. It will allow you to recover from your injuries at a faster pace. You will also be less worried when you fight.&#x201D;</p><p>Medusa was slightly stunned. A smile that was undetectable immediately surfaced on her cold pretty face. She swiftly stuffed the medicinal pill into her mouth and her eyes once again returned to being sharp and stern. Her body shot out and met with Yan Luo Tian.</p><p>A powerful energy ripple erupted when the two figures made contact. Perhaps it was because both of them wanted to pull their battle circle away, but their two bodies drifted for some distance during their lightning-like exchange, leaving behind sufficient space for Xiao Yan and the three Mulan Elders.</p><p>Xiao Yan&#x2019;s gaze swept over the battleground where a frighteningly powerful ripple was spreading. He immediately glanced at the three Mulan Elders in front of him as a bizarre look flashed across his eyes. The Gold Silver Brothers from the &#x2018;Black-Corner Region&#x2019; were able to rely on their seamless Qi Method to battle an elite Dou Zong because they were twins. Yet, these three people in front of them had clearly acquired the skill from training. However, this kind of fighting method had extremely harsh training requirements. It was also unusually troublesome to groom. One must overcome various limitations. However, if one managed to groom a group, their fighting strength would indeed be extremely frightening.</p><p>&#x201C;Hee hee. It is unexpected that a little brat like this is actually the chief of the Yan Alliance. No wonder the Jia Ma Empire ended up in such a state&#x2026;&#x201D; The lion-headed Elder&#x2019;s dark, cold gaze swept over Xiao Yan. He involuntarily shook his head and let out a cold laugh.</p><p>&#x201C;Don&#x2019;t waste your breath. Quickly finish him off. Yan Luo Tian alone will have difficulty dealing with Medusa.&#x201D; The tiger-headed Elder spoke in a deep voice.</p><p>The other two Elders nodded. They laughed coldly and their strengths began to merge together. A majestic Dou Qi immediately erupted and swept over the sky.</p><p>&#x201C;It is indeed a Dou Zong class aura&#x2026;&#x201D;</p><p>Xiao Yan raised his brows as he sensed this aura. He did not expect that he would meet such a strong person just after he had broken through to the next class. The other party was really a good opponent.</p><p>The people on the fortress held their breaths as they stared at both parties who were facing off against each other in the sky. Xiao Yan&#x2019;s ability to delay the three Mulan Elders would be the most crucial factor of this battle!</p>
