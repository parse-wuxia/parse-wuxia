<p><strong><u>Chapter 1355: Ban Sheng Energy Body</u></strong></p><p>A faint energy fog slowly drifted with the breeze above a desolate grayish-brown land. The hazy world caused one to feel an additional mysteriousness. It appeared that even the concept of time was lost to this quiet world.</p><p>A couple of figures were seated around a bonfire at a certain spot within this land. The flame lit up the faces of the few of them. They were Xiao Yan and Xun Er&#x2019;s group. However, they appeared to be even closer at this moment than in the past.</p><p>&#x201C;If I have guessed correctly, we should be reaching the deepest parts of the third region. If we are still going to travel tomorrow, all of us should be a little more careful. The deepest parts of the third level are the most dangerous place within the Heavenly Tomb.&#x201D; Gu Qing Yang lifted his head, glanced at the dim region around them, and spoke with a smile.</p><p>&#x201C;We have not meet anyone else during these three months. It looks like they have found spots to quietly train&#x2026;&#x201D; Xun Er softly commented.</p><p>Xiao Yan slowly nodded. Three months had passed since they had entered the third level. During these three months, their group had been hurrying to the deepest parts of the Heavenly Tomb. However, due to some powerful energy bodies blocking them along the way, they were finding it difficult to travel. Fortunately, the few of them had successfully charged in after joining hands.</p><p>&#x201C;Ugh, this Heavenly Tomb is indeed not as simple as I had imagined. The last time, I had nearly lost my life&#x2026;&#x201D; Gu Hua randomly tossed the tree branch beside him into the pile of fire and helplessly lamented. There was a scar on his face. It was left behind when their group had met with a group of energy bodies with an average strength of eight stars. That battle was miserable to the point of exceeding everyone&#x2019;s expectations. Fortunately, no deaths had occurred despite them suffering some injuries.</p><p>&#x201C;Further in will be even more troublesome than what we have meet with before. Therefore, everyone should be mentally prepared.&#x201D; Gu Zhen grinned as he spoke.</p><p>&#x201C;Allow me to continue the remaining journey&#x2026;&#x201D; Xiao Yan hesitated for a moment before speaking. Even with the six of them joining hands, it was quite difficult for them to survive. If they were to enter the deepest regions, there was no telling just what kind of trouble they would end up meeting. After this period of living together with Gu Qing Yang&#x2019;s group, Xiao Yan had formed a good impression of them. He did not want an accident to occur to them because of him.</p><p>&#x201C;You should tell Xun Er these words&#x2026;&#x201D; Gu Qing Yang smiled and replied.</p><p>&#x201C;We have already come this far, so let&#x2019;s not say such disheartening words&#x2026; as long as we are careful, there will likely not be any problems.&#x201D; Xun Er&#x2019;s pretty eyes stared at Xiao Yan as she gently responded.</p><p>&#x201C;Hopefully&#x2026;&#x201D;</p><p>Xiao Yan could only bitterly smile and nod his head when he heard her reply. After which, he lifted his eyes and looked into the grayish dark distance. The far end was where his target was located. It appeared as though he could sense the blood within his body flowing at a much faster rate.</p><p>&#x201C;A north-western direction. There are traces of four energy bodies present there. Three of them are around that of eight star Dou Zuns while one is at the ninth star&#x2026;&#x201D; Xiao Yan&#x2019;s shut eyes were slowly opened while he was behind a large rock. After which, he softly uttered this information to the group beside him.</p><p>They had formally entered the deepest parts of the Heavenly Tomb. The six of them had involuntarily become cautious despite their strength. They carefully picked their paths as they traveled. Even when they met energy bodies they could easily deal with, they would deliberate before attacking. After all, the energy bodies in were too frightening. No one knew if they would end up attracting even more powerful energy bodies once a fight begun. At that time, the energy bodies would surround them. The price they would have to pay was no longer just some injuries.</p><p>&#x201C;Gu Hua and Gu Zhen have already gone out to investigate. They should be returning soon&#x2026;&#x201D; Gu Qing Yang nodded and replied.</p><p>&#x201C;Chi!&#x201D;</p><p>Gu Qing Yang&#x2019;s words had just sounded when two black figures adhered to the ground. They used the enormous stone and the shadows of some trees as cover before swiftly appearing beside Xiao Yan&#x2019;s group. They were Gu Hua and Gu Zhen, who had gone out to investigate.</p><p>&#x201C;There are traces of activities by quite a number of energy bodies to the south and west, and we have also sensed some extremely powerful pressures. We cannot take these two routes.&#x201D; Gu Zhen and Gu Hua slowly sighed in relief before speaking.</p><p>&#x201C;In that case, we can only head to the north-west&#x2026;&#x201D; Xiao Yan frowned as he replied.</p><p>&#x201C;The western direction also possesses an extremely powerful pressure. This pressure has surpassed that of an ordinary nine star Dou Zun. However, there is still a gap to the Dou Sheng level&#x2026;&#x201D; Xun Er suddenly whispered at this moment.</p><p>Xiao Yan&#x2019;s group became quiet after hearing her words, stronger than a nine star Dou Zun while weaker than an elite Dou Sheng. It seemed&#x2026; it should be at the Ban Sheng class. This was also an extremely troublesome existence.</p><p>They were aware that the Ban Sheng energy bodies would possess many energy bodies guarding it. The Ban Sheng that they had met this time around only had four energy bodies around it. This was considered quite a small number.</p><p>&#x201C;What should we do? None of the three directions are easy to charge through. However, the north-western direction is a little easier. There are fewer energy bodies in that direction. It will not be easy to attract other energy bodies even if we end up fighting. If it is the other two areas, we will likely end up being surrounded once a battle erupts&#x2026;&#x201D; Gu Hua surmised the situation.</p><p>Xiao Yan revealed an expression contemplation. He exchanged glances with Gu Qing Yang, and his eyes shifted to the north-west. Their only option now was to take this route&#x2026;</p><p>&#x201C;Let&#x2019;s get moving. Try to be careful. Do not disturb the Ban Sheng class energy body. Although the Ban Sheng energy core is extremely alluring, we cannot lose our lives because of it&#x2026;&#x201D; Gu Qing Yang softly sighed.</p><p>&#x201C;Aye.&#x201D;</p><p>Xiao Yan also slowly nodded. After which, he exchanged looks with Xun Er. His body moved, and he transformed into a blurry figure that carefully rushed to the deepest parts of the Heavenly Tomb. Gu Qing Yang and the rest also followed behind. Their careful manner appeared to be a little comical.</p><p>The group of them quietly walked for a thousand feet within the energy fog before their footsteps slowly came to a halt. Four energy bodies were seated on a large rock a short distance in front. The figure at the middle appeared to be exceptionally powerful. It was a nine star energy body.</p><p>Xiao Yan&#x2019;s eyes were narrowed as they swept over these four energy bodies. After which, he turned and looked at Gu Qing Yang&#x2019;s group. They quietly made some hand gestures. After a couple of months of joining hands, the coordination between them had already become quite good.</p><p>The group nodded when they saw Xiao Yan&#x2019;s hand gesture. Their bodies slowly separated.</p><p>&#x201C;Attack!&#x201D;</p><p>Xiao Yan suddenly waved his hand when he saw that everyone was awaiting orders. At the same time, his body suddenly rushed forward. Within a flash, he had appeared in front of an eight star energy body. His fist, which contained a dense purple-brown flame, violently penetrated the energy body. It shattered the body into nothingness in an instant.</p><p>&#x201C;Bang!&#x201D;</p><p>When Xiao Yan&#x2019;s lightning-like attack struck the eight star energy body, the remaining two figures also burst apart. These energy bodies might be at the eight star level, but their actual strength was not at this level. Otherwise, they would not have been able to win.</p><p>&#x201C;Roar!&#x201D;</p><p>That nine star energy body appeared to have sensed something when the three energy bodies were killed. It suddenly opened both of its eyes. However, a furious roar had just been emitted from its mouth when four figures surrounded him in a triangular [a][b]formation. A mighty Dou Qi swiftly surged. After which, they turned into lightning that ruthlessly struck this nine star energy body.</p><p>&#x201C;Chi!&#x201D;</p><p>Faced with the combined attacks of Gu Qing Yang&#x2019;s group, this nine star energy body had just emitted a roar when a &#x2018;puff&#x2019; sound appeared, and it was transformed into nothing. A bright energy core dropped from it, abd Xun Er swiftly grabbed it.</p><p>The group faced each other and smiled when they saw that their sneak attack had succeeded. After which, they swiftly suppressed their voices because of Xiao Yan&#x2019;s hand signal and then quickly rushed into the distance.</p><p>The subsequent journey was smoother after they killed those four energy bodies. However, this smoothness did not continue for long. Xiao Yan&#x2019;s group&#x2019;s expressions had gradually become more solemn because they had began to sense a pressure slowly spreading from a short distance in front of them.</p><p>&#x201C;Ban Sheng&#x2026;&#x201D;</p><p>The brows of Xiao Yan&#x2019;s group were knit when they sensed this kind of pressure. Their speed also gradually slowed. If they were unable to pass through this obstruction, they would need to cease mentioning Xiao Xuan&#x2019;s tomb&#x2026;</p><p>&#x201C;Everyone, be careful&#x2026;&#x201D;</p><p>Xiao Yan softly said. He once again walked some distance forward. His body was hidden in the shadows of a large rock. His eyes narrowed as he looked forward.</p><p>The area where Xiao Yan&#x2019;s sight could reach was covered by an energy fog. This energy fog was not dense. A gust of wind blew over and caused the fog to scatter. Following the scattering of this energy fog, a thousand-foot-tall stone mountain suddenly appeared in view.</p><p>Xiao Yan&#x2019;s group&#x2019;s eyes locked on the top of the mountain when it appeared. That place possessed an enormous stone seat. A figure was quietly sat on it. A dark-red scimitar had been placed in front of him, and a dense bloody scent radiated from the large scimitar. It appeared like the fog that had lingered over this mountain.</p><p>&#x201C;What an overbearing aura&#x2026;&#x201D;</p><p>The expressions of Xiao Yan&#x2019;s group slowly became solemn when they sensed the overbearing aura that was spreadimg from those figures. Was this the energy body that had reached the Ban Sheng class? It was indeed powerful.</p><p>While Xiao Yan&#x2019;s group wore solemn expressions, that figure on the enormous stone mountain suddenly got up, and a bloody scent suddenly surged.</p><p>&#x201C;We have been discovered. There is no need to hide. Be careful&#x2026;&#x201D;</p><p>Xiao Yan gently exhaled when he saw the energy body stand. His heart was unafraid as a fiery heat surged within it. Fighting an elite Ban Sheng, this would be the first time in his life.</p><p>[a]A four figure triangle?</p><p>[b]well, one corner might have 2 people.</p>
