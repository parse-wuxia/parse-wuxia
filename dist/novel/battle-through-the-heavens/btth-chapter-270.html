<p><strong><u>Chapter 270: Purple Flame Pill</u></strong></p><p>Within the room, Xiao Yan slowly rubbed his chin, his face was filled with an expression of contemplation. A long while later, he flipped his hand and a transparent bottle appeared in his palm. A bottle full of Amethyst Essence was contained within the bottle.</p><p>Xiao Yan opened the bottle cap and extended his finger into it. As he carefully dipped a little of it, a stinging pain was immediately transmitted from his finger.</p><p>After withdrawing his hand, Xiao Yan&#x2019;s eyes stared intently at the drop of Amethyst Essence on the tip of his finger. The Dou Qi in his body flowed, seeped through his finger and gently touched the drop of purple colored Amethyst Essence. Immediately, a soft muffled &#x2018;bang&#x2019; sounded. A thread of tiny purple colored flame rose from his finger. The hot temperature caused Xiao Yan&#x2019;s eyes to narrow.</p><p>&#x201C;The temperature is not bad&#x2026; but unfortunately, the purple flame that a drop of Amethyst Essence can create is really too little.&#x201D; Xiao Yan smiled and nodded his head before he immediately said somewhat regretfully.</p><p>&#x201C;I don&#x2019;t have much Amethyst Essence stored. If a drop of it can only create this small bit of a Purple Flame, my losses would be far greater than my gain.&#x201D; Xiao Yan stared at the bottle of Amethyst Essence and said with his eyebrows knit together.</p><p>&#x201C;But this little fellow also did not absorb much of it. How did it spit out fire like a flamethrower?&#x201D; Xiao Yan slowly tilted his head and eyed the &#x2018;Heaven Swallowing Python&#x2019; who was enjoying itself greatly spitting out flames as he asked himself with uncertainty in his voice.</p><p>Xiao Yan&#x2019;s gaze was intently staring at the &#x2018;Heaven Swallowing Python&#x2019;. A long while later, he gently lifted his eyebrow. After some observation, he realized that at the moment when the &#x2018;Heaven Swallowing Python&#x2019; was about to spit out the Purple Flame, some saliva seemed to seep out between its fangs in its mouth. When the tiny purple colored flame seedlings came into contact with this saliva, its size suddenly expanded by over ten times.</p><p>&#x201C;Is it because of the saliva?&#x201D; Xiao Yan muttered softly in his mouth. He smiled slightly and as he flipped his palm, an empty bottle appeared in it. Immediately, he walked slowly over to the &#x2018;Heaven Swallowing Python&#x2019; with a smile on his lips.</p><p>&#x2026;&#x2026;</p><p>After a frustrating toss and turn that caused him to be covered in perspiration, Xiao Yan finally obtained slightly less than half a bottle of pale green colored saliva from the &#x2018;Heaven Swallowing Python&#x2019;s&#x2019; fangs under its resentful gaze. He placed it under his nose and sniffed the saliva which had a faint fragrance. Xiao Yan&#x2019;s face was strange as he shook his head. Glancing at the &#x2018;Heaven Swallowing Python&#x2019; on the bed, Xiao Yan muttered in his heart, &#x201C;This fellow, Don&#x2019;t tell me it is also a female?&#x201D;</p><p>Xiao Yan gently set the two bottles in his hand down as he mused for a moment. Suddenly, he beckoned with his palm and pulled out a dark red colored cauldron from his storage ring, which he then placed on the table. His finger flicked gently. A few wisps of a green colored flame shot out and a hot flame immediately rose within the medicinal cauldron.</p><p>Watching the writhing flame within the medicinal cauldron, Xiao Yan gently rubbed his storage ring and obtained a few completely red plants which with one glance, one would be able to tell that they contained fire type energy. Waving his palm, he threw them all into the medicinal cauldron. He then controlled the green colored flame and repeatedly refined them, turning them into a large pile of red colored powder.</p><p>Once the red colored powder appeared, Xiao Yan used two needle tubes that had hollow centers to suck a drop of Amethyst Essence and the saliva of the &#x2018;Heaven Swallowing Python&#x2019; respectively. After which, he cast them into the medicinal cauldron.</p><p>Eyeing the flame that was soaring within the medicinal cauldron, Xiao Yan smiled slightly. His ten fingers nimbly leaped about and the temperature of the green colored flame repeatedly rose and fell, changing with his thoughts. Although this kind of swift changing of the flame temperature was extremely testing on the flame controlling ability of an alchemist, the current Xiao Yan after he consumed the &#x2018;Fire Lotus Seed&#x2019; already possessed the ability to easily overcome these kinds of troublesome steps.</p><p>Within the medicinal cauldron, the green colored flame danced enchantingly. A long while later, the hot temperature gradually faded away. The turbulent flame also slowly disappeared. Finally it passed through the flame outlet, turned into a tiny wisp of flame and entered into Xiao Yan&#x2019;s finger.</p><p>&#x201C;Although a large amount of it was depleted during the refining of medicine, being able to retrieve a little is somewhat nice.&#x201D; Xiao Yan smiled as he eyed the wisp of green colored flame that had entered his body. He flicked his finger and a gentle breeze shot down the cover of the cauldron. He then beckoned with his hand and three red colored pills flew out before steadily landing in Xiao Yan&#x2019;s palm.</p><p>Xiao Yan played with these three Danwan and a smile involuntarily surfaced on the corner of his mouth. This kind of Danwan could not be called a medicinal pill. This was because they did not possess any unique properties like a medicinal pill. Anyone who swallowed this thing into their stomach would not only not receive the slightest benefit, but instead sink into a miserable state.</p><p>(L: Danwan is like a pill but it does not help any human who consumes it</p><p>After twisting a red colored Danwan between his fingers, Xiao Yan threw it into his mouth. He chewed it slightly and waited until he sensed the hot energy swiftly spreading in his mouth. At that moment, the Dou Qi in his body quickly swarmed up and collided with the hot energy.</p><p>At the moment of collision, Xiao Yan opened his mouth slightly. A cluster of hot purple colored flame was suddenly spit out. After which, it steadily landed on his palm that was wrapped with Dou Qi. It burnt with a rage and still had considerable might.</p><p>Xiao Yan gently breathed out a mouthful of hot air before lowering his head to eye the purple colored flame rising in his palm. The amount of Purple Flame this time around was about enough needed to merge with the &#x2018;Green Lotus Core Flame&#x2019;. At that moment, Xiao Yan heaved a sigh of relief. A drop of Amethyst Essence, a drop of the &#x2018;Heaven Swallowing Python&#x2019;s&#x2019; saliva and some fire type medicinal ingredients. The ability of these few things to achieve such an effect had satisfied Xiao Yan.</p><p>&#x201C;Let&#x2019;s call this thing &#x2018;Purple Flame Pill&#x2019;...&#x201D; Tossing the two red colored Danwan in his hand, Xiao Yan opened his mouth and laughed. The current him really wanted to try and see just how great the strength of the &#x2018;Angry Buddha Lotus Flame&#x2019; created from the merger of the &#x2018;Green Lotus Core Flame&#x2019; and the Purple Flame would be.</p><p>&#x201C;It looks like I need to find a flesh target&#x2026;&#x201D;</p><p>A smile surfaced on Xiao Yan&#x2019;s face as he eyed the &#x2018;Purple Flame Pill&#x2019;. He turned around and placed the &#x2018;Heaven Swallowing Python&#x2019; which had fallen asleep after becoming tired from spitting out flames. After which, he smiled and walked out of this shaking room, which appeared about to fall, to find a live target to test just how strong this imitated version of the &#x2018;Angry Buddha Lotus Flame&#x2019; was&#x2026;</p><p>Currently, it was the time of daily training at the &#x2018;Desert Metal Mercenary Company&#x2019; training ground. Therefore, many mercenaries were gathered on the training ground. They withstood the hot sun and were covered in perspiration as they sparred and compared their skills. On a shaded area on the open ground stood Xiao Ding and a few others. Their gaze occasionally swept across the training ground and nodded slightly.</p><p>&#x201C;Mister Luo Bu, looks like the brothers from the &#x2018;Sand Mercenary Company&#x2019; are getting along quite well with the others. You have worked hard during this period of time.&#x201D; Xiao Ding turned his head around and said with a smile to Luo Bu beside him as he eyed the mercenaries from both troops whose entanglement had clearly been significantly eliminated because of this period of adapting with one another.</p><p>&#x201C;These are all methods that Compay Leader Xiao Ding thought off. I have only executed them out.&#x201D; Luo Bu shook his head, the corner of his eye carried great respect as he glanced at Hai Bo Dong by the side. On one occasion, he had seen this old man fight. Therefore, he clearly knew just what kind of strength this inconspicuous old man had. Luo Bu&#x2019;s heart also became a little more afraid of Xiao Yan who was able to invite Hai Bo Dong to live in this Mercenary Company . When he noticed Xiao Ding ask this question, he hurriedly gave a polite reply.</p><p>Xiao Ding naturally knew the fear in Luo Bu. Immediately, he smiled and conversed a little with him before he turned around and glanced at Hai Bo Dong who was leaning against a tree trunk and pulling a long face. He said with a smile, &#x201C;Ke ke, Old Mister Hai, does the medicinal shop not have the medicinal ingredients that you need? Relax, I have already sent people to help you search in the neighbouring cities. If they obtain any news, they will report back very soon.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;At least you, little fellow, have put in some effort. That guy Xiao Yan has withdrawn into that courtyard ever since he told me about these medicinal ingredients and has not come out again.&#x201D; Hearing this, a weak smile appeared on Hai Bo Dong face as he replied to Xiao Ding.</p><p>&#x201C;Badmouthing people behind their backs is not a good thing&#x2026;&#x201D; A faint laugh was suddenly emitted from behind everyone. The familiar voice caused the few people to hurriedly turn their heads around and eye the smiling Xiao Yan who was walking over.</p><p>&#x201C;Is your injury completely healed?&#x201D; Eyeing Xiao Yan, whose presence clearly had greater vitality compared to the past, surprise flashed across Hai Bo Dong&#x2019;s old face as he asked in a stunned voice.</p><p>&#x201C;Yes.&#x201D; Xiao Yan smiled and nodded his head.</p><p>&#x201C;Ugh, what an abnormal person. Making a complete recovery in less than a month with that kind of serious injury&#x2026;&#x201D; Seeing Xiao Yan nodding his head, Hai Bo Dong immediately smiled bitterly and shook his head. At the same time, his heart was shocked by the means Xiao Yan had displayed.</p><p>Xiao Yan smiled and shook his head. He smiled and conversed with Xiao Ding and the others for a while before his gaze suddenly drifted to Luo Bu by the side. He smiled slightly, but the smile caused the latter to feel somewhat scared.</p><p>&#x201C;Company Leader Xiao Yan.&#x201D; Seeing Xiao Yan slowly walking over, Luo Bu hurriedly greeted.</p><p>&#x201C;Mister Luo Bu, are you getting used to being in the &#x2018;Desert Metal Mercenary Company&#x2019;?&#x201D; Xiao Yan inquired with a smile.</p><p>Seeing Xiao Yan&#x2019;s smile, Luo Bu hurriedly nodded his head. Currently, the news of the death of the First Elder in the Mo clan had almost spread throughout the eastern region of the Jia Ma Empire. Although other people may not be clear about who the killer was, Luo Bu knew very clearly in his heart that the person who did it was definitely this young man in front of him who appeared totally harmless.</p><p>&#x201C;Mister Luo Bu. Since you are idling around with nothing to do, can you help me with an experiment?&#x201D; Xiao Yan asked with another smile. He did not wait for Luo Bu to nod his head. Instead, he immediately lifted his feet and walked out of the shaded place. Although Xiao Yan&#x2019;s current strength had already returned to the Dou Shi class, Xiao Yan knew clearly that when dealing with a person like Luo Bu, Luo Bu would immediately be suspicious if someone was to suddenly become friendly with him.</p><p>Hearing Xiao Yan&#x2019;s words, Luo Bu was at a loss. Instantly, he smiled bitterly and shook his head before lifting his feet to follow.</p><p>Standing off to the side, Xiao Ding and Xiao Li saw this strange action, and could not help but exchange glances. After which, they also followed with curiosity.</p><p>Xiao Yan slowly came to a stop at a corner of the training ground. He faced Luo Bu who was somewhat uneasy and said with a slight smile, &#x201C;You should use all your strength to defend. I want to try to figure just how much strength the thing that I have just modified has.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Huh?&#x201D; Hearing this, the corner of Luo Bu&#x2019;s mouth quivered. His expression became somewhat purple. Xiao Yan had actually planned to use him as a target.</p><p>Xiao Ding and the others were all part of the upper echelon of the Desert Metal Mercenary Company. When the other company members in the training ground saw them gathering, they immediately began surrounding the place as they curiously watched Xiao Yan and Luo Bu at the middle of it.</p><p>&#x201C;Be careful.&#x201D;</p><p>Xiao Yan reminded Luo Bu, whose expression was both green and purple before he shook his finger. A red colored Danwan appeared, which he threw into his mouth in front of everyone&#x2019;s gaze. He chewed slightly and a moment later, opened his mouth. A cluster of hot purple colored flame was spit out and steadily landed on his hand which was isolated by Dou Qi.</p><p>Xiao Yan gently tossed this cluster of purple flame and smiled. Then he extended his right hand and a green colored flame slowly rose&#x2026;</p><p>Eyeing the two different colored flame on his two hands, Hai Bo Dong was at a loss momentarily. His expression immediately changed as he muttered, &#x201C;Damn it. Is this little guy planning to use that trick again?&#x201D;</p><p>As fear gradually rose in Hai Bo Dong&#x2019;s eyes, Xiao Yan, who was in the training ground, actually began to slowly place his two palms together&#x2026;</p><p>Seeing this action of Xiao Yan, Hai Bo Dong&#x2019;s expression finally changed completely. His feet suddenly stomped on the ground and shot up into the air in a lightning like manner in front of everyone&#x2019;s stunned gaze. He stomped and sharply said, &#x201C;Xiao Yan, you lunatic! The last time you almost killed yourself. You still want to try again?&#x201D;</p><p>Xiao Yan lifted his head and watched Hai Bo Dong in midair who had flown into a rage. His face was completely stunned. He had not expected that this old fellow would be so terrified of his &#x2018;Angry Buddha Lotus Flame&#x2019;...</p>
