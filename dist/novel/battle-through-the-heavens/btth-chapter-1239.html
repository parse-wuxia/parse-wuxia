<p><strong><u>Chapter 1239: Black Shadow Person</u></strong></p><p>Elder Hu smiled as he looked at the surprised expression of Xiao Yan and Mu Qing Luan. He said, &#x201C;This matter has caused an uproar all over the place recently. Many people were very curious just what kind of great being that murderer is. He actually dares to attack the Nine Serene Deep Ground Python, the local ruler of this Beast Region. It was really touching something that one should not touch.&#x201D;</p><p>Xiao Yan nodded slightly. By being able to become one of the three great tribes in the Magical Beast world, it was sufficient to indicate the strength of the Nine Serene Deep Ground Python tribe. As the saying went, a powerful dragon did not suppress the local snake. Even the renown great factions on the Central Plains would give the Nine Serene Deep Ground Python tribe some face in this place. Unless one&#x2019;s mind was a little mad, otherwise, one would not easily offend them. It was also because of this that Xiao Yan would feel so surprised when he heard that there was actually someone who was finding trouble with the Nine Serene Deep Ground Python in the Bone Mountains.</p><p>&#x201C;Perhaps it is just some enemies from the past&#x2026;&#x201D; Mu Qing Luan hesitated before commenting.</p><p>&#x201C;Who knows&#x2026; if it is an enemy, he would definitely eradicate the Nine Serene Deep Ground Python tribe. However, from the rumours that had spread during this period of time, the opponent of that fellow was completely the strongest experts within the Nine Serene Deep Ground Python. The lives of some of the weaker ones were not taken even when they met that mysterious killer.&#x201D; Elder Hu laughed bitterly. He was also extremely confused about this strange tactic of the mysterious killer.</p><p>Xiao Yan also frowned slightly upon hearing this. This person was indeed quite strange. As the saying went, it is easy to pinch a soft persimmon. However, this person did things in an opposite fashion. He purposefully find the troublesome opponents. Was this not trying to make things difficult for himself?</p><p>&#x201C;Those Nine Serene Deep Ground Python experts who had met that mysterious killer had all disappeared without exception. It was impossible to even find their corpse. This was the aspect that caused the Nine Serene Deep Ground Python tribe to panic a little. The most important thing of a tribe was its bloodline. No one knew if that mysterious killer is preparing for something by gathering so much Nine Serene Deep Ground Python blood&#x2026;&#x201D; Elder Hu said.</p><p>&#x201C;Forget it, this matter is unrelated to us. Let&#x2019;s quietly stay on this mountain top for these few days and constantly monitor the activity of the ancient remains. Additionally, tell everyone not to walk around the place. The Bone Mountain Range is currently very chaotic. It would be troublesome if some matter is created&#x2026;&#x201D; Xiao Yan mused for a moment. After failing to gain any conclusion, he could only shake his head. His thoughts were turned away from this matter as he opened his mouth and said.</p><p>&#x201C;Understood..&#x201D;</p><p>Elder Hu hurriedly replied in a respectful voice when he heard this.</p><p>&#x201C;Next, we shall wait for the ancient remains to open&#x2026;&#x201D;</p><p>Xiao Yan&#x2019;s eyes leaped over the many mountain tops, looked towards the somewhat distorted space at the middle of the mountain range and softly muttered.</p><p>After driving away the people from the Wind Lightning Pavilion, Xiao Yan&#x2019;s group settled down and set up tent on this mountain top once again. During the subsequent few days, the disciples from the Falling Star Pavilion had obeyed Xiao Yan&#x2019;s orders. None of them left the mountain top. They spent their day training and sparring. In any case, the size of the mountain top was quite large. It was sufficient for their activities.</p><p>During this quiet wait, Xiao Yan&#x2019;s group was also able to discover that the number of experts gathering at this Bone Mountain Range was also increasing. At the end, this entire mountain range was still lively even deep in the night. The noise directly charged to the clouds.</p><p>Three days passed in the blink of an eye amidst this kind of wait.</p><p>During these three days, the Wind Lightning Pavilion, which was thrust away in a miserable manner, did not come and seek trouble. Although Xiao Yan&#x2019;s group understood that Lei zun-zhe would definitely not be able to easily swallow this anger, he was at the very least aware that before he possessed the strength to defeat four Dou Zuns, he would not foolishly come and seek his own humiliation.</p><p>Everyone had been passing these three days on the mountain top. They did not disturb anyone nor did anyone disturb them. The laid back waiting was undoubtedly much better than the surrounding mountain range that was filled with fiery hot conflict.</p><p>With the gradual passage of the three days, the distorted space within the middle of the mountain range also became increasingly thin. Clearly, the spatial seal that had existed for countless number of years was about to disappear.</p><p>The thinning seal also caused the atmosphere of the entire mountain range to become unusually fiery hot. Under the allure of the ancient remains, it appeared that everyone was much more hot-tempered. Even the slightest conflict would immediately be escalated to a life and death battle.</p><p>Base on the rate at which the seal was changing, the seal would completely disappear in at the very most two days&#x2019; time. At that time, the ancient remains that had existed for countless number of years would be once again revealed in this world&#x2026;</p><p>The night was as cool as water. The icy cold moonlight scattered down from the sky and shone onto the well lit mountain range. It added a layer of mysterious yarn over the entire mountain range.</p><p>Xiao Yan was seated on a large rock at the edge of the mountain top. From this spot, he was coincidentally able to overlook more than half of the mountain range. He could still see quite a number of human figures and torch light flashing at the foot of the mountain.</p><p>Xiao Yan raised his head and looked at the bright moon in the sky. His mind became a little absent minded. An elegant and beautiful fit looking figure vaguely appeared in front of him, appearing just like the fairy in the moon.</p><p>&#x201C;Xun Er&#x2026; wait for me. Once I have resolved the issue of teacher&#x2019;s body, I will begin travelling to the Gu clan!&#x201D;</p><p>Xiao Yan&#x2019;s fist was clenched slowly. A determination flashed across his eyes. Regardless of just how mysterious and powerful the Gu clan was, it would definitely not hinder he and Xun Er from being together!</p><p>The current Xiao Yan could already be truly considered as a top tier expert in the Dou Qi continent. It was difficult for him to find any opponents from the same age group. With this hard work and achievement, he believed that he would definitely not lose even when faced with those young outstanding individuals from the Gu clan, who possessed the bloodline of a Dou Di!</p><p>Xiao Yan gently exhaled a breath. That graceful figure in his mind suddenly fluctuated without any warning. Immediately, a bewitching icy cold pretty face suddenly appeared.</p><p>&#x201C;Cai Lin&#x2026;&#x201D;</p><p>A complicated bitter smile surfaced on Xiao Yan&#x2019;s face as a beautiful and alluring face flashed across his mind. He softly muttered, &#x201C;I wonder&#x2026; that child in her womb&#x2026; has he/she been born&#x2026;&#x201D;</p><p>The moment he thought of this, Xiao Yan felt as though a tight string deep within his heart had been touched. Unexpectedly, the current him was soon about to become a father. He wondered if his father would wear his happiness on his brows if he was aware of this&#x2026;</p><p>&#x201C;Chi!&#x201D;</p><p>A slight sound of wind being split suddenly resounded in the night sky while Xiao Yan was feeling absent minded. This sound might be faint but it was still sensed by Xiao Yan, who had an extremely sharp awareness. Immediately, he turned his head and saw a black figure diving down from the night sky like an old eagle. Both of this person&#x2019;s hands were placed together and a tent emitted a sound of being burst apart.</p><p>After the tent burst apart, it revealed Zi Yan, who was in a deep sleep within it. However, the latter&#x2019;s perception was quite strong. She suddenly widened her eyes just when the tent was torn apart. A shock was felt when she looked at the black shadow pouncing over. Subsequently, she swiftly withdrew with her small feet.</p><p>&#x201C;Who are you, thief?&#x201D;</p><p>Xiao Yan was startled. A fury immediately surged up his eyes. His hand slammed the large rock under his body. After which, his body flew out like a large bird and pounced towards the black shadow person.</p><p>When Xiao Yan approached, he began to gradually realise that the size of the black shadow was clearly delicate and small. One could even vaguely see some curves formed by her clothes. It indicated her background. A ferocious ghost like mask was worn on her face, causing her to appear exceptionally mysterious.</p><p>That black shadow appeared as though she did not hear Xiao Yan&apos;s cry. A strange green light was suddenly erupted from under the ghost mask. This green light flashed and shone onto the face of Zi Yan, who was pulling back.</p><p>Zi Yan felt her sight become blurry when the light shone over. Even her mind had become a little absent minded.</p><p>&#x201C;Roar!&#x201D;</p><p>A purple Qi suddenly surged over her face while Zi Yan&#x2019;s mind was absent minded. A half a foot long purple dragon surfaced. Immediately, it curled and rose while roaring furiously towards the sky!</p><p>The dragon roar rose in a majestic manner and the green light collapsed almost instantly.</p><p>&#x201C;Ugh&#x2026; why is it not a snake?&#x201D;</p><p>That black shadow with a ghost mask was immediately stunned when she saw the purple dragon on Zi Yan&#x2019;s face. Immediately, a slight dumbfounded voice sounded.</p><p>&#x201C;Bang!&#x201D;</p><p>The three tents around the entire place immediately burst apart while the black shadow was startled. Little Fairy Doctor, Tian Huo zun-zhe and Xiong Zhan flashed and appeared. They saw the black shadow person attacking Zi Yan with a glance. All of their expressions immediately changed slightly.</p><p>&#x201C;Watch after Zi Yan!&#x201D;</p><p>Xiao Yan cried out in a deep voice. His body moved and he appeared in front of the black shadow person. He clenched his hand and the purple-brown flame was agglomerated into a large hand that violently slammed towards the latter&#x2019;s head.</p><p>The black shadow figure hurriedly withdrew when faced with this ferocious attack by Xiao Yan. An unusual green glow flashed under the ghost mask. It easily received the large fire hand. Immediately, the figure moved and swiftly rushed out of the mountain top. Clearly, she was also aware that it was pointless to stay any longer.</p><p>&#x201C;You wish to leave?&#x201D;</p><p>Xiao Yan&#x2019;s face sunk when he saw this. This person was too unusual. Moreover, her target was clearly Zi Yan. If he did not capture and interrogate her, there would definitely be much trouble in the future.</p><p>Silver light flashed under Xiao Yan&#x2019;s feet while this thought flashed across his heart. After which, it swiftly chased that black shadow person. His body moved and he appeared on the latter&#x2019;s head. Flame spread over his fist as it was once again violently smashed down.</p><p>Upon sensing the fierce wind that erupted over from above her head, the green light under the ghost mask of the black shadow person once again flashed. Immediately, a strong black shadow suddenly appeared behind her in a strange fashion. Dark black water covered the fist of this figure as it immediately threw a violent punch that collided with the fire punch of Xiao Yan.</p><p>&#x201C;Bang!&#x201D;</p><p>A frightening storm spread when the two fists collided. Xiao Yan&#x2019;s body shook and he took a couple of steps back. That strong human figure took two continuous steps back before his body shook and once again disappeared in a strange manner. By the time Xiao Yan had recovered, that black shadow person had already rushed into the vast deep mountains. With the cover from the night, she disappeared within the blink of an eye.</p>
