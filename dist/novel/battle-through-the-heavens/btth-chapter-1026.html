<p><strong><u>Chapter 1026: Peak Level Fight Among the Younger Generation</u></strong></p><p>Feng zun-zhe was slightly startled when he saw that Xiao Yan did not show any signs of being timid. An admiration that was difficult to detect flashed over his face. He did not know how Xiao Yan had been accepted as a disciple of Yao zun-zhe, who was extremely picky. However, at the very least, this courage was sufficient to get others to view him in a better light.</p><p>With Feng zun-zhe&#x2019;s old, sharp eyes, he was naturally able to tell that Feng Qing Er was extremely strong. Although Xiao Yan had broken through to the Dou Zong class, it was difficult to tell just who would win this battle.</p><p>Feng zun-zhe had also heard some of the rumors about some of the things that Xiao Yan had done. However, he had heard that this was because there was a powerful soul within his body. Lei zun-zhe had already taken the lead to prevent him from using it in this match. Thus, Xiao Yan&#x2019;s fighting strength would be significantly reduced.</p><p>Feng zun-zhe swept his gaze over Xiao Yan. He could vaguely sense the existence of a powerful spiritual body. However, he was disappointed that this spiritual ripple was not something that belonged to Yao Lao.</p><p>&#x201C;Be careful. If I guessed correctly, this woman&#x2019;s strength should have already advanced to the Dou Zong class after having soaked in the Heaven Mountain Blood Pool. Moreover, along with the fighting strength of her avatar, her strength has far exceed that of an ordinary Dou Zong&#x2026;&#x201D; Feng zun-zhe turned his head and instructed him.</p><p>&#x201C;If you are no match for her, there is no need to clash with her. Feng Qing Er&#x2019;s talent is indeed top notch among the younger generation I have met over these years. Even Qing Luan does experiences a gap with her. It is not embarrassing to lose to her.&#x201D;</p><p>Xiao Yan was startled when he heard this. Immediately, he smiled and nodded. That Wang Chen was able to borrow the help of the Heaven Mountain Blood Pool to reach half a foot into the Dou Zong class. With Feng Qing Er&#x2019;s even more terrifying talent, it was not an impossible task to breakthrough to the Dou Zong class in one go. However, the avatar that was mentioned from Feng zun-zhe&#x2019;s mouth caused him to feel a little surprised&#x2026;</p><p>Of course, Xiao Yan nodded on the surface. However, his body had quietly straightened a little. Feng Qing Er possessed her haughtiness while Xiao Yan similarly possessed his pride. He had just met Feng zun-zhe. Although the other party was indeed doing his best to protect him, Xiao Yan himself needed to perform in a way that was worthy of being valued by others. Xiao Yan did not flaunt anything through such a performance. All he wanted was to get other people to acknowledge Yao Lao&#x2019;s eyesight&#x2026; this was especially the case in front of Feng zun-zhe.</p><p>Xiao Yan gently inhaled a breath of air. He clenched his hand, and an enormous dark-black Heavy Xuan ruler flashed and appeared. Since his identity had been exposed, he was also able to use this Heavy Xuan Ruler as he pleased.</p><p>Xiao Yan&#x2019;s feet stepped through the empty air. He slowly walked down in front of the countless numbers of gazes. After which, his feet gently landed in the arena. He raised his eyes, looked at the colorfully clothed, haughty girl in front before using some strength to pick up the ruler&#x2019;s hilt.</p><p>The surrounding atmosphere had gradually become tense following Xiao Yan landing in the arena. Anyone could sense the swords drawn atmosphere within the stadium.</p><p>Feng Qing Er&#x2019;s name had reached the peak of the younger generation within the northern region of the Central Plains. No one could compare with her even among the four Pavilions. It was rumored that this lady had once exchanged blows with an Elder of the Wind Lightning Pavilion, who had reached the level of a two star Dou Zong, and ended up in a draw. At that time, she had yet to breakthrough the Dou Huang class. This battle result was something that one could be quite proud of. Moreover, the current her had already formally stepped into this level. Her fighting strength would naturally be even stronger!</p><p>Of course, Feng Qing Er might have a reputation of being strong, but Xiao Yan was not weak either. He might have swiftly rose recently, but the things he had done had caused others to feel extremely shocked. Ever since he had arrived in Tian Bei City, he defeated the genius of the Hong clan, Hong Chen, and had killed Chen Yun and Hong Tian Xiao, two genuine Dou Zong class experts as well as forcefully broke the Nine Heavenly Lightning Prison Formation that was set up by the three great Elders of the Wind Lightning Northern Pavilion. In the end, he even successfully fled from Fei Tian&#x2019;s hands. Each of these actions could only be described as startling from an observer&#x2019;s point of view. Although most of the people knew that all of this was done with the help of a powerful spiritual body from the rumors, this did not completely erase Xiao Yan&#x2019;s abilities&#x2026;</p><p>Currently, these two people from the younger generation, who possessed a great reputation, were meeting on this Lightning Mountain. The tit for tat atmosphere was something that could be clearly sensed by even those in the stands. Naturally, this exchange would undoubtedly become the most attractive battle since the beginning of this season&#x2019;s Four Pavilion Grand Meeting. It was likely that not a single person present did not wish to know just who the final victor would be in this battle between two top members from the younger generation in the northern region..</p><p>Quite a number of people felt their blood boil when they thought of this. Xiao Yan and Feng Qing Er might represent the peak level fighting strength between the younger generation of the northern region.</p><p>Although Fei Tian felt extremely unwilling after hearing Lei zun-zhe&#x2019;s words, he could only viciously slare at Xiao Yan, turn around, and return to his seat while feeling some anger.</p><p>Lei zun-zhe ignored Fei Tian, who was filled with anger. His gaze indifferently swept over Xiao Yan. Immediately, he glanced at Feng zun-zhe and his eyebrows were involuntarily knit. Until this moment, he could not understand why Feng zun-zhe would suddenly step forward and back Xiao Yan. Moreover, he was exceptionally insistent on his safety. There was basically no room for any negotiation</p><p>&#x201C;Just who is this brat to Feng zun-zhe?&#x201D;</p><p>Lei zun-zhe muttered in his heart while feeling lost. He turned his head and glanced at Fei Tian by the side. He spoke in a faint voice, &#x201C;What is there to be angry about? Qing Er is fighting in place of you, and even helped you avoid a bad reputation.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;That brat is extremely abominable. Even Elder Chen Yun has died by his hands. Don&#x2019;t tell me that we will just leave something like that be?&#x201D; Fei Tian spoke in a solemn voice.</p><p>&#x201C;If you feel that starting a war with the Falling Star Pavilion benefits us, we can also not let this matter rest&#x2026;&#x201D; Lei zun-zhe coldly chided.</p><p>Fei Tian was dull when he heard this. Immediately, he unwillingly grit his teeth. Feng zun-zhe&#x2019;s appearance had completely halted the Wind Lightning Pavilion&#x2019;s thoughts of killing Xiao Yan off.</p><p>&#x201C;However, the blades are blind in this current exchange. It is unavoidable for one to be injured in battle. Even Feng zun-zhe cannot say anything.&#x201D; A sinister look flashed across Lei zun-zhe&#x2019;s eyes. He glanced at Feng Qing Er facing Xiao Yan in the arena while speaking in a low, deep voice.</p><p>&#x201C;What does chief mean?&#x201D; Fei Tian was startled and immediately narrowed his eyes.</p><p>&#x201C;I have already instructed Qing Er that it is fine to use a powerful strike if she has the opportunity. Although that brat has advanced to the Dou Zong class, he is unable to obtain help from that mysterious spiritual body. He is likely no match for Qing Er&#x2026; moreover, injuries are commonplace in a fight.&#x201D; Lei zun-zhe slowly let on.</p><p>Fei Tian slightly nodded. A sinister smile appeared on his face. Xiao Yan had caused him to lose a great amount of face. How could his reputation survive if this matter were put aside as though nothing had happened.</p><p>Feng Qing Er raised her pretty eyes slightly in the arena where there was a swords drawn atmosphere. She looked at Xiao Yan in front of her. The other party&#x2019;s aura was indeed much stronger than when he was at the Heaven Mountain Blood Pool. No wonder he was full of confidence when he came to the Lightning Mountain.</p><p>&#x201C;Although I do not know how you managed to get Feng zun-zhe to stand behind you, you are likely too naive if you think that you can rely on this to behave atrociously on the Lightning Mountain without fear.&#x201D; Feng Qing Er&#x2019;s voice was still that clear and sweet. She was just like a phoenix that emitted a noble aura, which was difficult to hide.</p><p>Xiao Yan appeared as though he did not hear her words. His eyes calmly observed her. The majestic Dou Qi within his body was like a snake waking up from hibernation as it slowly circulated. Following the surge of his Dou Qi, a powerful aura was quietly emitted, charging to the clouds.</p><p>&#x201C;Based on my knowledge of you, it seems that you are someone who can only rely on external strength to create a reputation for yourself. It was the case with that spiritual body, and now it is the same with Feng zun-zhe. In other words, this might perhaps be called using the strength of others to act in an arrogant manner. Today, however, this manner of yours is useless&#x2026;&#x201D; Xiao Yan&#x2019;s calm manner caused Feng Qing Er eyebrows to become vertical as she coldly laughed. She did not like this person, who was of the same generation as her, revealing such a dislikable manner in front of her.</p><p>Xiao Yan raised his eyes and glanced at Feng Qing Er. Suddenly, he parted his lips and smiled. He said, &#x201C;It is unexpected that you are such a noisy woman. Since this is the case, I will also tell you the truth. If you do not have the Wind Lightning Pavilion or any other background, being the exclusive domain of another man might be your best choice with your appearance.&#x201D;</p><p>A chill slowly surged on Feng Qing Er&#x2019;s extremely beautiful face. Her pretty eyes coldly glared at Xiao Yan as a majestic aura that was not inferior to him blasted forth with the sound of rumbling thunder like an erupting volcano!</p><p>Her pretty eyes stared at Xiao Yan icily. A moment later, an ice-cold arc was lifted on Feng Qing Er&#x2019;s face. &#x201C;Believe me, you will regret that you said those words.&#x201D;</p><p>Xiao Yan merely grinned. His soft voice contained a kind of tit for tat tone that did not give in even a little.</p><p>&#x201C;I await you.&#x201D;</p><p>After Xiao Yan&#x2019;s words were spoken, the coldness on Feng Qing Er&#x2019;s face became even denser. Her pretty eyes were also slowly shut.</p><p>The atmosphere in the stadium suddenly became tense the instant she shut her eyes. A sharp killing intent that chilled one&#x2019;s heart swept through the air!</p><p>&#x201C;Shua!&#x201D;</p><p>Feng Qing Er shut her eyes for an instant before suddenly opening them. At this moment, her eyes had suddenly turned a strange green-silver color. The sharp, dense killing intent within them had reached a peak.</p>
