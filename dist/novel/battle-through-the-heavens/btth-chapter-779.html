<p><strong><u>Chapter 779: Operation</u></strong></p><p>Human figures were scattered around the top of a small mountain peak that was not far from the Black Mountain Fortress. However, no abnormal sound was present. Everyone was quietly sitting crossed-legged on the ground. Their powerful auras were suppressed to the weakest level.</p><p>Xiao Yan, Xiao Ding, Hai Bodong stood side to side on the mountain peak while conversing in a soft voice.</p><p>&#x201C;Has Medusa not arrived?&#x201D; Hai Bodong knit his brows slightly and looked in the direction of the Black Mountain Fortress as he chatted.</p><p>&#x201C;I have already informed her. I think that she should be consolidating the experts from the Snake-People Tribe.&#x201D; Xiao Yan smiled and replied. Not long after his words had sounded, a rushing sound was suddenly transmitted from the sky. A large group of figures rushed over. A couple of breaths later, they appeared in the air above the mountain peak before they slowly descended.</p><p>The human figure who had appeared was naturally the experts from the Snake-People Tribe. Their leader was Medusa.</p><p>Hai Bodong and the others sighed in relief when they saw Medusa appear. If this assassination lacked her presence, it would no longer have a meaning to it. With just Xiao Yan&#x2019;s strength alone, the danger of breaking into the place where the three army alliance gathered would undoubtedly soar.</p><p>Medusa&#x2019;s faint eyes paused on Xiao Yan&#x2019;s body as she landed. After which, they swept toward Hai Bodong and the others as she opened her mouth to say, &#x201C;Let&#x2019;s leave if we are all prepared.&#x201D;</p><p>Xiao Ding nodded slightly. He voiced his thoughts, &#x201C;The assassination this time around will follow our original plan. Third brother and Medusa will sneak into the city and find the opportunity to kill Yan Luo Tian and the three Mulan Elders. If your tracks are discovered or your assassination fails, Hai Bodong and the others hiding outside will lead people to rescue you. At that time, it is naturally best that we destroy those fellows if we still have the chance. If it is really impossible, we will withdraw first. We cannot afford an overly large loss. After all, we are currently unable to endure it.&#x201D;</p><p>Everyone nodded after hearing this.</p><p>&#x201C;Ke ke, in that case, we shall await the good news quietly in the Black Mountain Fortress.&#x201D; Xiao Ding also smiled when he saw this. He immediately cupped his hands to everyone as he spoke.</p><p>Xiao Yan smiled and nodded. After which, his gaze swept toward Medusa. Their gazes met for a moment before the latter immediately shifted it aside. Xiao Yan could only bitterly laugh when he saw this manner of hers. The fire wings on his back extended out. He immediately waved his hand and took the lead to rush to the sky.</p><p>The numerous Yan Alliance experts on the ground swiftly summoned their Dou Qi wings as well. They hurriedly followed after seeing that Xiao Yan had begun to move.</p><p>&#x201C;Let&#x2019;s leave too. Remember, all of you will listen to Hai Bodong&#x2019;s orders after I enter the city. You cannot disobey him. If anything is to go wrong midway, do not blame this Queen for serving you with the clan rules!&#x201D; Medusa turned her head and faintly spoke to the many experts within the clan.</p><p>The person at the front of the experts from the Snake-People clan was the second commander Hei Du who had some conflict with Xiao Yan. However, he hurriedly nodded his head when he heard Medusa&#x2019;s words. Medusa&#x2019;s prestige within the Snake-People Tribe was something no one dared challenge.</p><p>Medusa only nodded her slightly head after seeing this. Her body moved and it rose into the air without borrowing any external strength. After which, it finally transformed into a ray of light that followed Xiao Yan and the others in front. The experts from the Snake-People Tribe behind her also swiftly followed.</p><p>The three large empire might have temporarily moved back under the orders of the Little Fairy Doctor, but it did not completely withdraw. Instead, they had all gathered at a city at the border that connected the Chu Yun Empire to the Jia Ma Empire. They were ready to launch another attack at any time and swallow the Jia Ma Empire at one go.</p><p>After all, it was just as the Little Fairy Doctor had said. Although she possessed a dictatorship within the Poison Sect and not many people who dared to question her words within the entire Chu Yun Empire, the Gold Geese Sect and the Mulan Valley were not factions that originated from the Chu Yun Empire. Moreover, the overall strength of these two factions was not weaker than the Poison Sect. The two large Sects were originally willing to dispatch soldiers and experts to defeat the Jia Ma Empire because they wanted to get a portion of its territory. However, the Little Fairy Doctor had actually decided to give up on attacking after things had developed until this point. The two sects were naturally extremely dissatisfied.</p><p>Although Yan Luo Tian and the three Mulan Elders were seriously injured, once the essence strength reinforcements from the two sects arrived and delivered some high tier healing medicine, the two of them would naturally be able to regain their strength quickly. At that time, they would once again become an extremely great strength. It was not impossible for them to destroy the Jia Ma Empire and the Yan Alliance.</p><p>With this hope, it was only natural that the two sects were unwilling to withdraw their armies at this moment. Hence, the three parties were currently arguing bitterly with one another, causing Little Fairy Doctor to feel some headache. After all, the withdrawal of troops this time around was too sudden. Not only did the two sects oppose it but even the Poison Sect and the Chu Yun Empire also had some opposition. However, due to her reputation, no one dared to give voice to it.</p><p>Hence, even though the Little Fairy Doctor had decided to withdraw the army, the danger that the Jia Ma Empire and the Yan Alliance faced had yet to be completely resolved. As long as Yan Luo Tian and the three Mulan Elders were around, it was likely that the Gold Geese Sect and the Mulan Valley would not give up!</p><p>Hence, these two people must be eliminated!</p><p>This current moment was the best opportunity to strike!</p><p>The border city where the three country alliance were staying in was only fifty over kilometers from the Black Mountain Fortress. With the speed of Xiao Yan and the others, they gradually approached their destination within an hour. It was a small depression in the mountains that was not far from the city.</p><p>The Yan Alliance and the Snake-People Tribe began to swiftly descend while they were still some distance from the city because they were worried that the experts within the city would discover a large number of auras. They quietly entered the forest before walking toward a hidden depression in the mountains.</p><p>No one acted immediately after they walked to their destination. Instead, all of them began to quietly adjust their aura under Xiao Yan&#x2019;s arrangement, doing their best to raise their condition to its best.</p><p>Xiao Yan&#x2019;s gaze was coincidentally able to see the city not far away from the top of a tree located in this small depression between the mountains. He could see that the city was covered with soldiers patrolling to and fro. Moreover, there would occasionally be expert Dou Wangs who would fly in an intersecting manner in the sky. Any unusual activity would be first spotted by these people who were high in the sky.</p><p>&#x201C;The defenses of this place are indeed tight. It seems that the other party is prepared&#x2026;&#x201D; Xiao Yan studied those expert Dou Wangs patrolling. He curled his mouth and felt somewhat troubled as he spoke.</p><p>&#x201C;Didn&#x2019;t that Little Fairy Doctor give you a jade plate? She will naturally remove some of the defenses once you break it. However, it seems to me that those patrolling clearly aren&#x2019;t merely experts from the Poison Sect. Even if she could remove some defenses, she can only move the experts from the Poison Sect away. The experts from the Gold Geese Sect and the Mulan Valley will still perform their due diligence and guard this place.&#x201D; A faint voice was transmitted from behind him. Xiao Yan did not need to turn his head to know that it was definitely Medusa.</p><p>&#x201C;Yes, but there&#x2019;s no choice. This kind of thing originally posed some risk. We will act when night falls. Given both of our strength, it is likely extremely difficult to discover us even with expert Dou Wangs patrolling as long as we are a little careful.&#x201D; Xiao Yan nodded his head and softly replied.</p><p>A low &#x2018;yes&#x2019; sound was emitted from behind him. Clearly, Medusa did not have any other opinions.</p><p>Xiao Yan swiftly took out that gray-colored jade piece from his Storage Ring after hearing this. After which, he broke it before patting his hands as he said with a smile, &#x201C;Now, we should wait until night falls.&#x201D; He turned his head around as he spoke and looked at the bewitching exquisite face which gave one an icy-cold feeling. After a brief moment of hesitation, he suddenly whispered, &#x201C;That&#x2026; I&#x2019;m sorry for yesterday&#x2026;&#x201D;</p><p>Medusa was also startled when she heard this. Eyes which were filled with an allure swept over Xiao Yan. This was the first time that she had heard Xiao Yan speak in such a manner ever since she became acquainted with him.</p><p>&#x201C;You also know how to apologize huh&#x2026;&#x201D; Medusa lowered her face slightly and spoke in a faint voice. Despite speaking in this manner with her mouth, even she did not sense that her face had become slightly gentler. Clearly, this apology from Xiao Yan did have quite the effect.</p><p>Xiao Yan smiled somewhat awkwardly. He rubbed his hands and said, &#x201C;I am currently unable to refine the &#x2018;Heaven Soul Blood Bone Pill&#x2019;. Once I have raised my refining skills a little, it is likely that I will be able to start refining it. However, you need not worry. I will definitely succeed within two years.&#x201D;</p><p>Medusa nodded. For some unknown reason, there was some joy within her heart when Xiao Yan placed this matter seriously within his heart. This kind of emotion was quite rare for someone as temperamental as her.</p><p>The last remaining thread of resentment completely scattered when Xiao Yan spoke these words. Medusa had just wanted to speak when her eyebrows were suddenly raised. Her delicate hand was suddenly waved and a suction force surged out from it. A dark-black bat was caught in her hand. Her gaze swept over it only to see that a small paper reel was held in its claws.</p><p>Medusa removed the paper reel and flicked her finger, sending the bat into the deep forest. After which, she slowly opened it and softly said, &#x201C;This is something the Little Fairy Doctor sent over. It is a map of the city. It indicates the position where the Yan Luo Tian and the three Mulan Elders are located.&#x201D;</p><p>Xiao Yan rejoiced a little in his heart upon hearing this. With this map, they would save the effort of randomly searching about. This did indeed provide great help toward their goal.</p><p>&#x201C;Yan Luo Tian is in the mid-northern area while the three Mulan Elders are in the west. Looks like we will need to split up and act.&#x201D; Medusa voiced her thoughts. &#x201C;Although Yan Luo Tian is seriously injured, he is ultimately still an elite Dou Zong. He will be extremely difficult to deal with should he retaliate. Hence, leave him to me. The three Mulan Elders have lost one member. By not being able to use the &#x2018;Three Beast Savage Skill&#x2019;, they are merely ordinary expert Dou Hunags. Hence, it should not be a problem for your full strength to deal with them. What do you think?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Yes&#x2026; you should be careful.&#x201D; Xiao Yan felt a little moved when he saw that Medusa had distributed the most dangerous job to herself. He immediately smiled and nodded.</p><p>&#x201C;In that case&#x2026;&#x201D; Medusa let out a smile. Her epiphyllum-like smile caused Xiao Yan&#x2019;s eyes to brighten.</p><p>&#x201C;Let&#x2019;s wait until night falls.&#x201D;</p>
