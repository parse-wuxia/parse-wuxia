<p><strong><u>Chapter 652: Gathering Helpers</u></strong></p><p>&#x201C;Business transaction? What kind of business transaction?&#x201D;</p><p>The three leaders who had originally thought that Xiao Yan wanted to turn against them were stunned when they heard the words that leaped from Xiao Yan&#x2019;s mouth. They immediately asked uncertainly.</p><p>Xiao Yan smiled and mused for a moment before speaking slowly, &#x201C;The profits in Feng City are indeed extremely rich. I can allow your three factions to occupy a share in Feng City.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;What does chief Xiao want us to do?&#x201D; The three leaders looked at each other before the shadowy-faced old man carefully asked. They did not believe that a pie would fall from the sky for no reason.</p><p>&#x201C;I have an enemy which is quite strong. Although I already have confidence to contend with them given my current strength, I still require some helpers.&#x201D; Xiao Yan&#x2019;s gaze locked onto the three of them and laughed faintly. &#x201C;I only require you three leaders to lend me a hand at that time.&#x201D;</p><p>Xiao Li, who was frowning after hearing Xiao Yan&#x2019;s earlier words from behind him, also began to relax. The enemy that Xiao Yan had mentioned was naturally the Misty Cloud Sect. He was clearly aware in his heart that although Xiao Yan&#x2019;s strength had soared, he was weak in numbers. On the other hand, the Misty Cloud Sect had numerous experts, and a strong foundation. By just relying on their few little scrimps, there was a helpless feeling of mayflies attempting to shake a large tree.</p><p>The intention he had stated earlier was that he wanted to come to the &#x2018;Black-Corner Region&#x2019; to expand and strengthen his faction. However, if he were to rely on this method, it would at least require a year before they would be able to achieve the strength to contend with the Misty Cloud Sect. This current method of Xiao Yan to gather the help of other factions within the &#x2018;Black-Corner Region&#x2019; would have the quickest result. However, they needed to lose some profits. This was nothing compared to the blood feud created from the destruction of the clan.</p><p>&#x201C;Enemy?&#x201D; The three leaders were startled when they heard this. Their expression immediately became a little volatile. Xiao Yan still needed to gather helpers despite his current strength. Just how strong was his enemy? Although the profit of Feng City was rich, it would not be worthwhile if they were to end up being pulled into a firepit.</p><p>&#x201C;May I know which faction on the continent is the enemy that chief Xiao mentions?&#x201D; The sexily clad pretty woman finally could not resist opening her mouth to ask a moment later.</p><p>Xiao Yan laughed softly. A dense coldness faintly flickered through his dark-black eyes, &#x201C;Although that faction has been hiding in one corner like a tortoise all these years, I think that everyone should have heard of them.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Jia Ma Empire&#x2019;s, Misty Cloud Sect!&#x201D;</p><p>A faint, cold voice was slowly spat out of Xiao Yan&#x2019;s mouth before resounding within the large hall.</p><p>&#x201C;The Misty Cloud Sect?&#x201D; The three leaders softly muttered this somewhat familiar name in their mouths. Their expression changed a little a moment later. They exchanged glances with one another before that shadow-faced old man voiced his thoughts, &#x201C;I seem to have heard some news about this faction. If the news I have obtained is correct, the Misty Cloud Sect has an elite Dou Zong!&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Aye, I have also obtained some news earlier that an elite Dou Zong had appeared within the Jia Ma Empire. His name&#x2026; seemed to be called Yun Shan?&#x201D; The sexily clad pretty woman also recalled a little as she spoke with a solemn expression.</p><p>Xiao Yan did not feel surprised that the three leaders had heard of the Misty Cloud Sect. Although the &#x2018;Black-Corner Region&#x2019; was tens of thousands of kilometers from the Jia Ma Empire, it would not hinder some of the very important news from spreading. Dou Zong. An expert of this class could be considered a top notch expert even when placed in the entire Dou Qi continent. Hence, the news began to spread like wildfire once it was spread from the Jia Ma Empire.</p><p>The leaders of the three large factions looked at one another. A moment later, they shook their heads in a somewhat embarrassed manner. The shadowy-faced old man smiled awkwardly to Xiao Yan and said, &#x201C;Chief Xiao, you cannot blame us for this decision. The &#x2018;Black-Corner Region&#x2019; is thousands of kilometers from the Misty Cloud Sect. Even with our speed, it would likely require at least two to three months to make a trip there and back. Moreover&#x2026; the Misty Cloud Sect&#x2019;s strength is indeed strong. It can be considered to be somewhat renowned even in the entire north-western region of the continent. I think that it won&#x2019;t be easy to take revenge even with our help.&#x201D;</p><p>The strength of the Misty Cloud Sect could be considered to be near that of a first-tier faction even in the entire north-western part of the continent. If these first-tier factions from the &#x2018;Black-Corner Region&#x2019; were to be placed on the entire continent, it was obvious that they would be ranked a little lower. If one wanted to find one single faction within the entire &#x2018;Black-Corner Region&#x2019;, it was likely that none of them would be able to surpass the Misty Cloud Sect. The earlier &#x2018;Black Alliance&#x2019; might perhaps be able to stand shoulder to shoulder with the Misty Cloud Sect, but it was an alliance and not a single faction.</p><p>Of course, if Xiao Yan were able to gather the factions within the entire &#x2018;Black-Corner Region&#x2019;, he would naturally be able to far surpass the Misty Cloud Sect. However, it was basically impossible to unite everyone in this chaotic place.</p><p>&#x201C;Ke ke, you three leaders must be afraid that Xiao Yan is unable to deal with the Misty Cloud Sect, and will end up dragging all of you into a mess, right?&#x201D; Xiao Yan was not infuriated by the reaction of these people. He merely laughed softly.</p><p>The three of them gave an embarrassed smile but did not try to defend themselves.</p><p>&#x201C;Other than Yun Shan, the Misty Cloud Sect will not have more than three elite Dou Huangs in total. The remainder are mostly some Elders at the Dou Wang or Dou Ling class, and there is nothing to fear from them. The lower level disciples pose no threat at all.&#x201D; Xiao Yan laughed in a faint voice, &#x201C;We also possess an elite Dou Zong. As for Dou Huangs, is there anyone who is stronger than Han Feng? Hence, we only need to find some helpers who are qualified to help us resist the large forces of the Misty Cloud Sect. This is not difficult for the three of you.&#x201D;</p><p>The eyes of the three leaders flickered, but they still remained quiet.</p><p>&#x201C;They are indeed a group of people who will do nothing without seeing the reward&#x2026;&#x201D; Xiao Yan&#x2019;s brows were knit slightly when he saw the united silence of these three people. He immediately shook his head helplessly and said, &#x201C;The ambition of the &#x2018;Xiao Gate&#x2019; does not stop at Feng City. We will definitely continue to spread throughout the &#x2018;Black-Corner Region&#x2019; in the future. Given our strength, the profits that we will obtain in the future are countless times greater than now. If the three of you are willing to help me, I will not forget all of you when it comes to this big cake in the future&#x2026;&#x201D;</p><p>A boiling heat surged within the hearts of these three leaders when they heard Xiao Yan&#x2019;s words. Currently, the &#x2018;Xiao Gate&#x2019; possessed Xiao Yan and the mysterious Dou Zong behind him. Its strength had already exceeded that of the &#x2018;Black Alliance&#x2019; back then. It was likely that there was no faction within the &#x2018;Black-Corner Region&#x2019; who could contend with them. Hence, these words of Xiao Yan had undoubtedly held great attraction to them. However&#x2026; that damn Misty Cloud Sect, was not some ordinary being.</p><p>Xiao Yan smiled once again as he saw the changing expression of the three people. His voice faintly unleashed the final potent medicine, &#x201C;You all should have heard of the &#x2018;Mighty Huang Pill&#x2019;, no?&#x201D;</p><p>The three leaders immediately raised their heads when the calm voice sounded. Their gazes stared firmly at Xiao Yan and their eyes were filled with a wild joy.</p><p>The &#x2018;Mighty Huang Pill&#x2019; was a medicinal pill which was known to be at the peak of the tier 6 medicinal pills. Its effect was very simple. Using it would allow an elite Dou Huang to raise his strength one or two stars within a short period of time. Moreover, the &#x2018;Mighty Huang Pill&#x2019; has another use: it could refine one&#x2019;s bones.</p><p>The remnant medicinal strength after the increase in one&#x2019;s strength would help strengthen the body of the person who had consumed it. Although this kind of strengthening could not be compared with the kind of frightening strengthening that Xiao Yan had experienced underground, it would still be able to increase one&#x2019;s fighting ability significantly.</p><p>Simply speaking, the effect of the &#x2018;Mighty Huang Pill&#x2019;, and the &#x2018;Dou Spirit Pill&#x2019; was similar. However, the &#x2018;Dou Spirit Pill&#x2019; was only useful to a Dou Wang, while the &#x2018;Mighty Huang Pill&#x2019; had great use to an elite Dou Huang. Moreover, it had the additional effect of strengthening one&#x2019;s bones.</p><p>Even without this effect, it would still be one of the medicinal pills that was most sought after by an elite Dou Huang. The allure of raising one&#x2019;s strength by one or two stars was too attractive to them. It should be known that when one reached the level of a Dou Huang, it was not an uncommon thing for some of the unlucky ones to have difficulty raising their strength by one level even after a couple of years.</p><p>A medicinal pill that could raise one&#x2019;s strength would always possess the greatest allure!</p><p>Hence, the three leaders did not hide the desire within their hearts. This kind of medicinal pill was not something that they had never thought about. However, it was likely that Han Feng alone possessed ability to refine it within the entire &#x2018;Black-Corner Region&#x2019;. However, they never had a good relationship with Han Feng. Hence, it was naturally impossible for him to spend the effort to refine this kind of medicinal pill for them. It was this reason that their hearts were all lifted when Xiao Yan mentioned this name.</p><p>&#x201C;Chief Xiao is able to refine the &#x2018;Mighty Huang Pill&#x2019;?&#x201D; The wild joy within the eyes of the three of them slowly began to withdraw a moment later. The bare-armed Wild Lion Gang leader was the first to involuntarily inquire.</p><p>The other two people hurriedly threw their gaze to Xiao Yan when they heard these words. A &#x2018;Mighty Huang Pill&#x2019; was a peak tier 6 medicinal pill. Back then, even Han Feng&#x2019;s chances of success when refining it were not very high, much less this very young Xiao Yan.</p><p>&#x201C;I would not be mentioning this in front of the three of you if I didn&apos;t know how to refine it.&#x201D; Xiao Yan smiled. He flicked his finger and a wisp of jade-green flame suddenly surfaced. The temperature of the entire hall immediately soared following the appearance of the flame. Even the air had become exceptionally dry.</p><p>&#x201C;This is&#x2026; &#x2018;Heavenly Flame&#x2019;?&#x201D;</p><p>The eyes of the three of them shrank as they looked at the wisp of jade-green flame. Their feet involuntarily took a couple of steps back. Being elite Dou Huangs, they were clearly aware of just what kind of frightening strength a &#x2018;Heavenly Flame&#x2019; possessed. Despite their strength, it would be extremely troublesome if they were to touch even a little bit of this thing.</p><p>&#x201C;It is only natural for me to have my capital in order to kill Han Feng.&#x201D; Xiao Yan looked at the three people as he spoke with a faint smile. His long finger danced agilely as that wisp of dark-green flame obediently lingered and danced around his finger.</p><p>&#x201C;Since I am able to kill him, it is only natural that I have surpassed him. Why can&#x2019;t I refine the things that he can?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;If the three of you agree with my condition, I will definitely hand over the &#x2018;Mighty Huang Pill&#x2019; once the matter is successfully settled. Moreover, all of you will be able to enjoy a profit in the &#x2018;Black-Corner Region&#x2019; that would cause others to envy you. What do you say?&#x201D; Xiao Yan&#x2019;s soft laughter landed in the ears of the three of them, causing their breathing to slowly become rough and heavy.</p><p>Their faces turned a little flush as their eyes flicked about in a volatile manner. Their hearts had also descended into a great conflict.</p><p>Xiao Yan ceased saying anything in the face of the conflict of these three people. He narrowed his eyes and waited for the final reply of these three people. The temperature of the wisp of dark-green flame on his finger also quietly rose with his mood while he waited&#x2026;</p><p>The three leaders finally recovered from their struggle when the temperature of the hall rose to a certain degree. They looked at one another before they eventually grit their teeth and nodded violently. They would go all out and seek wealth even amid danger!</p><p>&#x201C;Alright, we will do as you say!&#x201D;</p>
