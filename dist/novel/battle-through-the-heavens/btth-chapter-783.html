<p><strong><u>Chapter 783: Sky Bird Nine Flying Wings</u></strong></p><p>Xiao Yan involuntarily licked his mouth as he looked at this beast bone scroll. No wonder those two fellows would be so crazy when they saw what he did. It was actually because of this thing.</p><p>He coveted the &#x2018;Three Beast Savage Skill&#x2019; the three Mulan Elders practiced. It was unexpected that he would actually be able to get his hands on it today. This was really an unexpected surprise.</p><p>Xiao Yan carefully opened the white bone scroll. His gaze swept over it only to end up frowning slightly a moment later.</p><p>&#x201C;What is it?&#x201D; Medusa by the side could not resist opening her mouth to inquire when she saw Xiao Yan looking like this.</p><p>&#x201C;Ugh, although this is indeed the &#x2018;Three Beast Savage Skill&#x2019;, it is only one of the parts. According to what is written on it, the &#x2018;Three Beast Savage Skill&#x2019; is divided into three parts. This is only one of them. Even though I have obtained it, it is of not much use.&#x201D; Xiao Yan shook his head and sighed quite emotionally.</p><p>Medusa hesitated for a moment after hearing this. She took out two Storage Rings from her breast pocket and said, &#x201C;These are the Storage Rings of the two other Mulan Elders. You can search and see if the remaining two parts are within them.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;You finished off the other two old fellows?&#x201D; Xiao Yan asked with some surprise as he studied the Storage Rings in Medusa&#x2019;s hands.</p><p>&#x201C;Aye, aye, aye.&#x201D; Medusa casually mentioned as she nodded. That manner was as though the two who were killed were not experts at the peak of the Dou Huang class but merely two unimportant chickens.</p><p>Xiao Yan involuntarily laughed when he heard her reply. There indeed was still a gap between him and her&#x2026; he extended his hand and received the two Storage Rings. His Spiritual Strength was inserted into both of them. Currently, the three Mulan Elders were all dead. Therefore, the Spiritual Imprints that remained on their Storage Rings were extremely vulnerable. Hence, Xiao Yan&#x2019;s Spiritual Strength managed to break into them in an extremely smooth manner, and it swiftly swept over the interior.</p><p>A wild joy suddenly surged in Xiao Yan&#x2019;s eyes after the Spiritual Strength swept over it. His hand moved, and two more white bone scrolls appeared in his hand. These two scrolls had similar blood-red large words on them.</p><p>&#x201C;The Three Beast Savage Skill! It is actually the Three Beast Savage Skill!&#x201D;</p><p>Xiao Yan carefully opened the two white bone scrolls. He studied them carefully and could not resist laughing out loud a moment later. He waved his hand and stored the three white bone scrolls into his Storage Ring. Being able to obtain such a reward today had exceeded his expectations.</p><p>Medusa&#x2019;s face also revealed a faint smile when she saw the grin on Xiao Yan&#x2019;s face. She immediately took out a golden-yellow scroll from her Storage Ring and handed it over to Xiao Yan, &#x201C;This is something that was obtained from Yan Luo Tian. It should be considered a secret skill in the Gold Geese Sect that is not taught. It would give you great benefits if you successfully practice it.&#x201D;</p><p>Xiao Yan was somewhat surprised as he received this golden-colored scroll. He slowly opened it and a couple of bright golden words were imprinted into his eyes.</p><p>&#x201C;Sky Bird Nine Flying Wings!&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;A flying Dou Technique?&#x201D; Xiao Yan was immediately stunned when he saw these few words. He was currently already an expert at the Dou Huang class. An ordinary flying Dou Technique would have difficulty comparing with the speed of his Dou Qi wings. When one reached a strength at his level, a flying Dou Qi seemed to no longer be of much use.</p><p>&#x201C;This is not just an ordinary flying Dou Technique. Do you remember the substance like enormous wings of Yan Luo Tian? That was due to him practicing this thing. The Gold Geese Sect specializes in speed. If that fellow really wants to flee, even I would not be able to catch up with him. This is because of this &#x2018;Sky Bird Nine Flying Wings&#x2019;.&#x201D; Medusa seemed to be aware of what Xiao Yan was thinking in his heart and began to softly explain, &#x201C;Rather than saying that this is a flying Dou Technique, it should instead be called a kind of flying Dou Technique manufacturing method.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;A flying Dou Technique manufacturing method?&#x201D; Surprise flashed through his eyes when he heard this. A flying Dou Technique was quite rare on the Dou Qi continent and its manufacturing method had mostly been lost. It was unexpected that the Gold Geese Sect would possess one. However, if it was really as Medusa had said, the value of this scroll would definitely not be lower than the &#x2018;Three Beast Savage Skill&#x2019;. Moreover, in terms of quality, this &#x2018;Sky Bird Nine Flying Wings&#x2019; was obviously much higher than his &#x2018;Purple Cloud Wings&#x2019;. It was naturally difficult to compare their speed.</p><p>&#x201C;This thing&#x2026; seems like it would also benefit you, right?&#x201D; Xiao Yan held this scroll, looked at Medusa&#x2019;s face before suddenly speaking. Since an elite Dou Zong like Yan Luo Tian was able to practice it, it was likely that this &#x2018;Sky Bird Nine Flying Wings&#x2019; was of quite some use to an elite Dou Zong.</p><p>Medusa hesitated slightly when she heard this. She immediately nodded and said, &#x201C;If this &#x2018;Sky Bird Nine Flying Wings&#x2019; is manufactured with some high grade ingredients, the flying wings that would be created would indeed benefit me. However, they would not be very beneficial to me if they were to be made with ordinary ingredients.&#x201D;</p><p>Xiao Yan smiled and stored the scroll into his Storage Ring,, &#x201C;In that case, I shall keep this thing first. Once I have gathered some ingredients, I will help you manufacture a pair of wings that will be useful to you.&#x201D;</p><p>Medusa vaguely smiled and nodded.</p><p>&#x201C;Since we have settled all these issues, let&#x2019;s return to the Black Mountain Fortress. I think that big brother and the others will have become anxious from all the waiting.&#x201D; Xiao Yan turned his head and laughed to Hai Bodong&#x2019;s group not far behind him.</p><p>Hai Bodong&#x2019;s group naturally did not object to his words. Although the people from the Snake-People Tribe felt somewhat unstable in their hearts because of how Medusa treated Xiao Yan, they did not dare to reveal even the slightest dissatisfaction in front of Medusa. Some fellows muttered in their hearts, &#x201C;This bastard. Once the First Commander returns from the Tager Desert, we will see whether you will still dare to follow by Her Majesty&#x2019;s side.&#x201D;</p><p>Xiao Yan was naturally unaware of the thoughts in the hearts of these fellows. Hence, he waved his hand, took the lead and started flying to the Black Mountain Fortress. A large group of experts followed close behind.</p><p>The successful return of Xiao Yan&#x2019;s group naturally caused Xiao Ding to heave a great sigh of relief. This was especially so after he had heard that the targets were dead. A joy that was difficult to hide was revealed on his calm face. After removing these two fellows that really gave them a great headache, the Yan Alliance would be able to obtain a precious period of time to recuperate.</p><p>Even though the Gold Geese Sect and the Mulan Valley felt a deep ingrained hatred for the Yan Alliance, they would definitely not dare to launch such a great campaign like they did this time after having lost Yan Luo Tian and the three Mulan Elders; otherwise known as the deterrent strength of an elite Dou Zong. On the other hand, the Yan Alliance not only possessed Xiao Yan, an alliance chief who could fight with a Dou Zong, but also Medusa, a genuine elite Dou Zong. They had already surpassed the Gold Geese Sect and the Mulan Valley at the top expert level. If the alliance gained a few more middle level experts, they would be able to surpass these two large sects in all areas.</p><p>Although the Gold Geese Sect and the Mulan Valley were not considered a top-tier faction in the enormous northwestern region, they were, at the very least, much stronger than the Misty Cloud Sect from back then. The ability to turn an existence that the Misty Cloud Sect of the past was afraid to offend into such a miserable state was enough to prove the great strength of the Yan Alliance.</p><p>With the flow of time, Xiao Yan was confident that he would be able to turn the Yan Alliance into one of the most powerful factions in the northwestern region. At that time, it was likely that they would possess some ability to resist an enormous being like the &#x2018;Hall of Souls&#x2019;.</p><p>The assassinations that had occurred in an extremely sudden manner turned the Gold Geese Sect and the Mulan Valley completely silly. According to the reports of the Yan Alliance spies, the elite experts from the two sects arrived on the third day after the successful assassinations. However, when they discovered that the strongest fighting strength within their sect had already long been eliminated by others, all of them became stunned. It appeared as though they had been struck by lightning.</p><p>As Xiao Yan and the others expected, these elite experts who had rushed over did not dare to do anything despite the fury burning in their hearts after learning that they had lost Yan Luo Tian and the three Mulan Elders. All of them suddenly descended into a stalemate. This kind of stalemate was finally broken when the Poison Sect suddenly announced their withdrawal from the alliance.</p><p>The Gold Geese Sect and the Mulan Valley were extremely dissatisfied with this action of the Poison Sect. However, after having lost the two Dou Zongs, Yan Luo Tian and the three Mulan Elders, their overall strength was already incomparable to the Poison Sect. Hence, despite all of them feeling anger in their stomachs, they could only miserably return to their respective empires while feeling a great unwillingness. Whatever intense assault that their sect would face after returning was their new problem&#x2026;</p><p>With the withdrawal of the three sects, the great calamity that threatened the entire Jia Ma Empire had completely disappeared. While a countless number of people in the Jia Ma Empire celebrated, the newly established Yan Alliance was firmly imprinted into the hearts of every single person in the empire. Only at this moment did the Yan Alliance replace the position of the Misty Cloud Sect in the hearts of these citizens!</p><p>The Jia Ma Empire&#x2019;s borders gradually calmed down following the end of the chaotic battle. The empire had also fulfilled their promise to the Snake-People Tribe and partitioned a large dark, cool region near the Magical Beast Mountain Range to give to the Snake-People Tribe. Upon receiving a ground where they could breed, many of the guards in the hearts of the Snake-People Tribe members held against the people of the Jia Ma Empire disappeared. Perhaps after interacting over time, the Snake-People Tribe might become a powerful faction within the Jia Ma Empire. At that time, the strength of the Jia Ma Empire would soar as a result of their incorporation.</p><p>Adding the current relationship between Xiao Yan and Medusa, the Yan Alliance might obtain benefits that were difficult to estimate!</p>
