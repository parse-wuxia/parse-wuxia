<p><strong><u>Chapter 1557: The Strength of the Nine Mysterious Golden Lightning</u></strong></p><p>From this, one could gain an understanding of just how terrifying the body of the Nine Mysterious Golden Lightning was.</p><p>However, everything required to increase one&#x2019;s lower also carried a risk. If there was a high risk involved, a greater reward would naturally follow. Even if Xiao Yan did not use the Nine Mysterious Golden Lightning to breakthrough to the sixth star of the Dou Sheng class after absorbing it , just having it in his hands meant that Xiao Yan would possess a killing weapon against an opponent who had reached the seventh star of the Dou Sheng class&#x2026;</p><p>The temptation that came from such a powerful weapon caused Xiao Yan&#x2019;s calm heart to pound despite the risks that accompanied it. Although Xiao Yan&#x2019;s strength had reached the peak level within the continent, his opponents were not ordinary beings. Having another trump card in his hand was equivalent to having another life.</p><p>&#x201C;It is really the case of seeking treasures from danger&#x2026;&#x201D;</p><p>Xiao Yan slowly withdrew the excitement within his heart. His eyes continued to flicker as he glanced around the deepest part of the lightning sea. After hesitating within his heart for a short moment, he finally made up his mind. He would act if he found an opportunity, but if it was still extremely difficult to subdue the Nine Mysterious Golden Light in its weakened state, he could only choose to withdraw.</p><p>Xiao Yan focused his mind after making his decision. His eyes swept over the many lightning arcd that were exploding on the enormous body of the golden lightning dragon deep in the sea of lightning.</p><p>While the Nine Mysterious Goldening Lightning was emitting a miserable roar, the surrounding Black Demon Lightning began to flee into the distance. At this moment, they did not even feel like chasing Xiao Yan. Instead, they stayed ten thousand feet away from the Nine Mysterious Golden Lightning. Even though they did not possess any intelligence, their instincts told them that the Nine Mysterious Golden Lightning was experiencing an extremely critical moment.</p><p>&#x201C;Crackle!&#x201D;</p><p>A golden bolt of lightning that was one-fifth the Nine Mysterious Golden Lightning ruthlessly exploded on the surface of its body. A golden lightning arc filled with an exterminating strength wildly wiggled. This retaliation explosion caused even something as strong as the Nine Mysterious Golden Lightning to struggle. However, some spirituality began to slowly rise within the dragon&#x2019;s icy-cold emotionless eyes. This caused it to appear to have gained a little more life and to no longer appear as cold as a statue like it did earlier.</p><p>Xiao Yan involuntarily licked his lips upon witnessing this change. It was unexpected that this Nine Mysterious Golden Lightning had to endure such a ferocious retaliation in order to form a spirit, but if it was able to endure, it would likely become quite a terrifying existence in the future. There were all sorts of mysteries in this world. An example was the Bodhisattva Ancient Tree. It might only be an ancient tree, but at its peak, it was rumored to have even exchanged blows with an elite Dou Di. Similarly, the Bodhisattva Ancient Tree did not possess much intelligence. The stronger a natural spiritual object was, the more difficult it was for it to form a spirit. This was the case for the Bodhisattva Ancient Tree, and it was no different for the Nine Mysterious Golden Lightning.</p><p>&#x201C;Bang bang!&#x201D;</p><p>After a spiritual aura rose within the eyes of the Nine Mysterious Golden Dragon, the retaliation within its body became even more intense. A thunder-like explosion reverberated from its body. Each terrifying explosion caused Xiao Yan&#x2019;s scalp to numb. Against these wild and violent explosions, the spirituality within the Nine Serene Golden Lightning dragon&#x2019;s eyes was scattered.</p><p>&#x201C;What a terrifying backlash. No wonder the Bodhisattva Ancient Tree is unable to form a spirit. If it does, there is no telling just how frightening the retaliation force would be&#x2026;&#x201D; Xiao Yan felt speechless as he watched the spiritual aura within the eyes of the Nine Mysterious Golden Lightning blast apart. From the looks of it, this Nine Mysterious Golden Lightning might not succeed in forming a spirit.</p><p>&#x201C;Wu!&#x201D;</p><p>The surrounding Black Demon Lightning beings seemed to have also sensed this through their instincts while this thought flashed through Xiao Yan&#x2019;s heart. A mysterious sound of sadness was emitted from the sea of lightning. Countless bolts of Black Demon Lightning gathered together and pounced toward the Nine Mysterious Golden Lightning.</p><p>The many arcs of Black Demon Lightning turned into tiny black electric sparks that invaded the Nine Mysterious Golden Lightning&#x2019;s body upon contact. After their entry, the intense explosions happening in the body of the Nine Mysterious Golden Lightning seemed to have weakened. It seemed as though these Black Demon Lightning beings were using themselves to block the retaliation explosions happening within the body of the Nine Mysterious Golden Lightning.</p><p>The spirituality within the eyes of the Nine Mysterious Golden Dragon became denser as many Black Demon Lightning beings pounced over. At the same time, its originally bright golden body dimmed. The retaliation forces had caused it to grow weaker.</p><p>&#x201C;Roar!&#x201D;</p><p>The bolts of Black Demon Lightning deep within the sea of lightning became even crazier while the Nine Mysterious Golden Lightning let out a sharp miserable roar. They fearlessly charged into its body, but as the spirituality within the Nine Mysterious Golden Lightning&#x2019;s eyes became denser, the explosions happening within the dragon&#x2019;s body became even more uncontrollable. The exterminating ripples that dispersed from it caused even Xiao Yan in the distance to feel afraid.</p><p>&#x201C;Looks like this big fellow is about to fail&#x2026;&#x201D;</p><p>Being a non-related party, Xiao Yan appeared quite calm. His eyes swept over before he shook his head. The retaliation explosions that had been unleashed within the Nine Mysterious Golden Lightning&#x2019;s body had soared many times over. According to this trend, the bolts of Black Demon Lightning were unable to suppress the lightning explosions regardless of how they pounced over. Once they failed to suppress these forces, the intelligence and spirit that the Nine Mysterious Golden Lightning had formed after much difficulty would be blasted apart.</p><p>Xiao Yan softly sighed after clearly envisioning the end. The Nine Mysterious Golden Lightning had been formed after an unknowingly long period of time. It was indeed a pity for it to fail to form a spirit. The heavens might have blessed it with great strength, but they had also deprived it of other rights.</p><p>&#x201C;Bang bang bang!&#x201D;</p><p>The Nine Mysterious Golden Lightning appeared dim as it lay deep in the sea of lightning. Its body, which appeared to be made of gold, had also became a lot more illusory It no longer had the ability to resist such a frightening backlash.</p><p>The surrounding Black Demon Lightning being cease charging forward when the Nine Mysterious Golden Lightning deflated into the lightning sea as though it had accepted its fate. They lingered around the dragon and emitted deep whines. Their voices were filled with misery.</p><p>&#x201C;Ugh&#x2026;&#x201D;</p><p>Xiao Yan sighed after watching the Nine Mysterious Golden Lightning weaken. The dragon was no longer able to cause him to feel the danger he had felt earlier.</p><p>&#x201C;The spiritual formation has failed&#x2026;&#x201D; Xiao yan shook his head. He stepped through empty space and rushed down. After which, he appeared deep within the sea of lightning. He looked at the ten-thousand-foot-large golden lightning dragon from close proximity. The dragon was looking at him with a pair of extremely dim eyes. It did not launch any attacks.</p><p>&#x201C;Whine!&#x201D;</p><p>However, the Black Demon Lightning beings furiously rushed over when Xiao Yan had barged in again. They whistled and charged over, but Little Yi rose from Xiao Yan&#x2019;s shoulder. Only then did these charging bodies came to a halt, as though they were extremely afraid of the baby.</p><p>&#x201C;Give me your strength and I will help you form a spirit.&#x201D;</p><p>Xiao Yan&#x2019;s body floated in front of the Nine Mysterious Golden Lightning. His tiny body was just like an ant. However, his calm voice caused the dim dragon eyes of the Nine Mysterious Golden Lightning to fluctuate.</p><p>&#x201C;Great strength is the biggest obstacle to the formation of your spirit&#x2026;&#x201D; Xiao Yan&#x2019;s hand gently pressed on a dragon scale in front of the Nine Mysterious Golden Lightning eyes. Immediately, a pink flame surged from his finger. After which, he violently pulled. A bright golden lightning glow was immediately pulled out of the Nine Mysterious Golden Lightning&#x2019;s body. The golden lightning vaguely gathered into a giant lightning dragon.</p><p>The extraction was unexpectedly smooth. One reason was that the Nine Mysterious Golden Lightning was extremely weak. The second was that it did not retaliate even a little, as though it had understood Xiao Yan&#x2019;s words. In order to possess intelligence, it was willing to abandon its strength. It was already tired of this kind of blurry feeling of existence&#x2026;</p><p>&#x201C;What a terrifying destructive force&#x2026;&#x201D;</p><p>The pink flame on Xiao Yan&#x2019;s palm soared. It transformed into a huge fire net that firmly restrained the golden lightning dragon. This was the strength within the Nine Mysterious Golden Lightning&#x2019;s body. The destructive properties inside had greatly exceeded Xiao Yan&#x2019;s expectations. Even his body would explode if he were to absorb this destructive energy.</p><p>&#x201C;Roar!&#x201D;</p><p>The golden lightning dragon wildly struggled within the fire net. It wanted to escape, but it clearly did not possess the ability to do so without being driven by someone or something.</p><p>&#x201C;Seal!&#x201D;</p><p>Xiao Yan slid his finger across the air in front of him and a blood line flew out. After which, a formation swiftly formed on the fire web. A fire glow shook and the fire net, which had wrapped around the golden dragon, began to rapidly shrink. Finally, it turned into a miniature lightning dragon that entered Little Yi&#x2019;s body. This destructive strength was something that only Little Yi&#x2019;s fire spirit could endure.</p><p>Xiao Yan only sighed in relief after completing this task. His eyes returned to the Nine Mysterious Golden Lightning in front of him. Since its strength had been extracted, it had turned into a hundred-foot-large golden dragon.</p><p>Xiao Yan&#x2019;s hand gently rubbed the dragon head of this Nine Mysterious Golden Lightning. His hand formed a seal and the spiritual aura around him swiftly gathered before turning into a spiritual seed that slowly entered the body of the Nine Mysterious Golden Lightning. Currently, the Nine Mysterious Golden Lightning was only an existence equivalent to a Dou Zun. There was no retaliation as its spirit formed at this moment.</p><p>Xiao Yan smiled when he saw the spiritually soaring within the dragon eyes of the Nine Mysterious Golden Lightning. Obtaining intelligence was only too easy after giving up its power.</p><p>&#x201C;In the future, you will be the only Nine Mysterious Golden Lightning that possesses intelligence in this world&#x2026;&#x201D;</p><p>Xiao Yan once again patted the Nine Mysterious Golden Lightning. After which, he suddenly turned around. His body turned into a bright light that rushed out of the lightning pool.</p><p>The dragon eyes of the Nine Mysterious Golden Dragon studied the back of the figure flying away from the deep lightning pool. At this moment, it was just like a small beast that had just been born. It firmly remembered the first person it had seen and would never forget him&#x2026;</p>
