<p><strong><u>Chapter 615: Slow Transformation</u></strong></p><p>Under such a refining effort by the &#x2018;Fallen Heart Flame&#x2019;, Xiao Yan and Queen Medusa had truly entered an intersection between life and death!</p><p>The heart flame that appeared in Xiao Yan&#x2019;s body this time around was even more intense than any previous times. Even when he received the essence of the &#x2018;Fallen Heart Flame&#x2019; to refine his body back then, the strength of that heart flame was at least a couple of times weaker than the heart flame at this moment.</p><p>Xiao Yan&#x2019;s face had become somewhat purplish because of the flush redness of his skin. Blisters repeatedly formed on his skin. The frighteningly high temperature that had surged out from his body appeared as though it wanted to incinerate his entire body. It was being grilled under such high temperature. If Xiao Yan himself did not control a &#x2018;Heavenly Flame,&#x2019; to some extent, a resistance to these &#x2018;Heavenly Flames&#x2019; as well as the refinement of his body by the heart flame some time earlier, it was likely that he would have been turned to dust with a &#x2018;bang&#x2019; like his robes earlier the moment the heart flame appeared&#x2026;</p><p>Despite this being the case, the high temperature that had spread to every corner of his body tortured Xiao Yan until he was better off dead than alive. Even he could clearly sense that the blood in his body was boiling. His Qi Paths twitched and his bones were emitting a groan that suggested they were overwhelmed. If the situation continued in such a manner, it was likely that Xiao Yan&#x2019;s body would completely disappear from this world within a short period of time.</p><p>&#x201C;Peng!&#x201D;</p><p>A spark was suddenly erupted from Xiao Yan&#x2019;s black hair following the increasingly intense spreading of the heart flame within his body. Immediately, that spark resulted in the rest of his hair completely turning into dark-black powder, which drifted down, leaving behind a completely bald head like a light bulb.</p><p>Xiao Yan could not pay any attention to the incineration of his hair. As of this moment, he was forcefully enduring the intense pain that drilled his heart. The &#x2018;Green Lotus Core Flame&#x2019; controlled by him was repeatedly expelling the heart flame, which continuously rose within his body. However, these actions were futile. The energy that &#x2018;Fallen Heart Flame&#x2019; possessed within this magma world was something that even Queen Medusa and Yao Lao found extremely troublesome to deal with. Hence, despite Xiao Yan using all his strength and suppressing the flame all over his body, he could only allow the heat of the flame to rise with greater strength. That high temperature also became increasingly frightening&#x2026;</p><p>&#x201C;This time&#x2026; it is truly the end.&#x201D;</p><p>Xiao Yan&#x2019;s mind was focusing on the uprising furnace-like interior of his body. His mind slowly transmitted a frail feeling. A powerless sleepiness quietly spread over Xiao Yan&#x2019;s heart.</p><p>The &#x2018;Fallen Heart Flame&#x2019; did not have any mercy. Hence, it would naturally not give consideration to Xiao Yan&#x2019;s feelings. Instead, it gradually increased the temperature of the flame. It appeared to be able to sense that after a short while, it would be able to swallow the &#x2018;Green Lotus Core Flame&#x2019;...</p><p>Queen Medusa at the side was also suffering while Xiao Yan was about to descend into the hopeless state of being about to be refined. Although she could forcefully resist with her powerful strength, the two spirits which were repeatedly entangled above her head indicated that she was resisting an extremely intense pain. Moreover, this pain was spread out from deep within her spirit, and would not be any better than the torture that Xiao Yan was enduring.</p><p>The painful expression on Queen Medusa&#x2019;s face suddenly reduced slightly following the flow of time. That human and snake figures within the invisible flame above her head also unknowingly and quietly began to show traces of merging together.</p><p>From the looks of the situation, Queen Medusa may have felt the tortuous feeling of having her spirit burned, but the &#x2018;Fallen Heart Flame&#x2019; also seemed to have randomly grilled the spirit of Queen Medusa and the &#x2018;Heaven Swallowing Python&#x2019; until they merged together. Although such merger was extremely slow, one could just imagine that she would truly possess the control of that body once she endured until the two spirits merged completely. At that time, the restraining effect of the &#x2018;Fallen Heart Flame&#x2019; would automatically disappear&#x2026;</p><p>Although the &#x2018;Fallen Heart Flame&#x2019; possessed some intelligence, it clearly was not knowledgeable about such a situation. Therefore, it did not know that it was quietly providing a great help to Queen Medusa when it increased the refinement of the heat flame&#x2026;</p><p>Of course, this was merely the circumstances of Queen Medusa. Compared to her, Xiao Yan seemed to be much more miserable. This was because as the temperature within his body rose, this physical body of his would be slowly melted within this high temperature&#x2026;</p><p>Xiao Yan&#x2019;s face was bright-red. At a glance, his current imagine appeared to be a person who had been flayed, and looked extremely frightening. With the increase in the temperature of his body, his skin had quietly cracked apart. Boiling fresh blood flowed out and dyed his body in blood.</p><p>Xiao Yan&#x2019;s outer appearance was shocking while the interior of his body was so miserable that one could not bear to look at. His Qi Paths were distorted because they had dried up, appearing like a plastic cylinder which had been burned by a flame. All the various organs in his body were also seriously distorted. If not for the &#x2018;Green Lotus Core Flame&#x2019; going all out to protect them, it was likely that they would have been vaporized by the high temperature.</p><p>Of course, these were not the only things that had turned into a miserable state. The sea urchin like Dou Crystal within his vortex had also appeared to have become a sea urchin that was thrown into a pot of boiling oil. It was completely red and repeatedly emitted hot air. Even the Dou Qi that filled its interior had also begun to boil.</p><p>The immediate result of this miserable situation both within and outside his body was that Xiao Yan had instantly entered a seriously injured state where death was imminent. A thread of chaotic consciousness slowly drifted within his body and was in danger of disappearing at any moment. Once his thread of consciousness disappeared, it would be sufficient to pronounce his death. Similarly, it would also pronounce the success of the refinement by the &#x2018;Fallen Heart Flame&#x2019;. The &#x2018;Green Lotus Core Flame&#x2019; within his body would also be completely swallowed&#x2026;</p><p>The &#x2018;Fallen Heart Flame&#x2019; also became somewhat excited as it seemed to sense that it was about to achieve its aim. Two faint green glows firmly stared at Xiao Yan, who had blood scars all over his body. While the green glow soared, the heat that was emitted by the heart flame that flowed all over his body also became increasingly terrifying&#x2026;</p><p>&#x201C;Teacher&#x2026; I&#x2019;m sorry. I&#x2026; did my best&#x2026;&#x201D;</p><p>Xiao Yan&#x2019;s consciousness became increasingly faint, causing Xiao Yan to feel as though he was walking toward a world that was filled with darkness. His extremely weak mutterings carried his last consciousness as they quietly disappeared.</p><p>The instant that Xiao Yan consciousness walked into the darkness, the green lotus which Xiao Yan was seated cross-legged on suddenly emitted a faint green glow. Finally, it seemed to be unable to endure that high temperature, and began to slowly melt.</p><p>The entire green lotus swiftly melted into a large cluster of green-colored liquid as the melting intensified. The liquid spread and immediately covered Xiao Yan&#x2019;s naked body.</p><p>&#x201C;Crack&#x2026;&#x201D;</p><p>The storage ring on Xiao Yan&#x2019;s finger also began to form some crack lines under such high temperature while the green-colored liquid wrapped around Xiao Yan. A moment later, it finally burst apart and a large pile of various objects suddenly appeared&#x2026;</p><p>The green-colored liquid completely wrapped around all the things that had appeared from the storage ring. It slowly rotated and expelled all the various rubbish like the scrolls. The various things that remained were all things like medicinal ingredients and various types of medicinal pills.</p><p>The liquid rotated and all the medicinal ingredients and medicinal pills that Xiao Yan had stored in his storage ring were slowly melting within the green-colored liquid. Finally, numerous medicinal liquids of varying luster appeared before mixing with the green-colored liquid until it became multi-colored.</p><p>The medicinal ingredients and medicinal pills within the storage ring made up Xiao Yan&#x2019;s entire collection. As of this moment, that green-colored liquid did not seem to have any intelligence as it melted and randomly mix all of them without any due care, much like it was cooking a hodgepodge&#x2026; There were quite a number of high tier medicinal pills among those medicinal pills. The &#x2018;Ground Spirit Pill&#x2019; which Yao Lao had refined after much difficulty was also among them. However, at this moment, it had also turned into an extremely powerful dark-red liquid that was mixed with all the various colored liquids&#x2026;</p><p>No one knew whether this random chaotic mixture was a poison or a tonic. This was because the entire thing was merely a kind of coincidence. The high temperature had caused the green lotus to melt, followed by the storage ring bursting apart. After which, it mixed everything in a baffling manner. Following which, it mysteriously invaded Xiao Yan&#x2019;s body which had been destroyed until it no longer appeared human.</p><p>The multicolored liquid wrapped firmly around Xiao Yan, repeatedly entering his pores and wounds and flowing into Xiao Yan&#x2019;s body&#x2026;</p><p>This liquid that was the merger of a countless number of medicinal pills and medicinal ingredients flowed into Xiao Yan&#x2019;s body. Finally, it flowed thread by thread into every single part of his body. Following their invasion, the Qi Paths, bones, and blood, which were originally about to be completely destroyed, strangely but slowly emitted a faint glow. Moreover, they became just like a little tree which had encountered rain during spring, allowing them to grow tenaciously once again!</p><p>The vitality that suddenly rose within Xiao Yan&#x2019;s body once again attracted the attention of the &#x2018;Fallen Heart Flame&#x2019;. The green glow flashed immediately and the heart flame which filled the interior of Xiao Yan&#x2019;s body once again erupted with frightening temperature!</p><p>The high temperature that suddenly erupted caused his Qi Paths, bones, blood, muscles, etc., which had just regained some life to once again shrivel. However, where that colorful and incomparably powerful liquid continued to flow past, life strangely appeared once again.</p><p>The heart flame repeatedly destroyed while the colorful liquid repeatedly healed&#x2026;</p><p>These two things appeared to have engaged in a tug of war in Xiao Yan&#x2019;s body. Each time the heart flame incinerated a Qi Paths, bone, muscle, etc., until it was about to break apart, the strange liquid would immediately invade it until it emitted a sign of life. This process would subsequently be repeated. The cycle appeared to be endless&#x2026;</p><p>The intense pain that this kind of tug of war created was something that basically no one could endure. It was fortunate that at this very moment, Xiao Yan had entered a pseudo-death state due to his imminent death. Hence, he did not feel any of this intensely inhuman pain. Otherwise, even if the strange liquid, which was the mixture of various different things, healed his body, he was likely to be tortured into a lunatic under this kind of intense pain&#x2026;</p><p>Therefore, in a cluster of somewhat invisible-whitish flame deep within the vast magma was a naked man and woman. Each of them were experiencing their own kind of slow but immense transformation&#x2026;</p><p>Such a transformation was extremely slow. No one knew just how long it would last. Perhaps a month, perhaps half a year, perhaps a year, perhaps even longer&#x2026;</p><p>However, there was one point that one did not need to doubt. If they were able to endure this transformation and eventually wake up from it, they would truly be&#x2026; completely transformed.</p><p>The transformation was slowly progressing!</p>
