<p><strong><u>Chapter 1296: Interception</u></strong></p><p>An exclamation was emitted from Yun Yun&#x2019;s mouth while her face turned completely red. Immediately, her hand was waved suddenly. Wind danced and the soft blanket on the bed flew up before completely wrapping around the alluring body.</p><p>Yun Yun&#x2019;s expression only became a little better after her lovely body was hidden within the blanket. She lifted her pretty face and stared at Xiao Yan with embarrassment and anger. She demanded, &#x201C;Why are you still watching?&#x201D;</p><p>Although she was currently covered by a blanket, the blanket was quite thin. When it covered over Yun Yun&#x2019;s lovely body, it still ended up revealing an alluring curve. After being set off by the bright red face that was filled with shyness, the scene was sufficient to cause quite a number of man to bleed wildly from their nostrils.</p><p>&#x201C;Cough&#x2026;&#x201D;</p><p>Xiao Yan coughed dryly. He withdrew his eyes in an extremely calm manner and said, &#x201C;This has nothing to do with me. You are the one who blasted it apart&#x2026;&#x201D;</p><p>Hearing these words of Xiao Yan, Yun Yun involuntarily felt speechless and furious despite usually being calm. This brat was actually someone who proclaim innocence despite having taken advantage of her.</p><p>Xiao Yan did not dare to be overly entangled over this topic when he saw Yun Yun was showing signs of becoming mad. He hurriedly asked, &#x201C;How do you feel now?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Alright. A crack line has been torn on the seal by you. Currently, there&#x2019;s quite a lot of Dou Qi continuously flowing out from the seal. This speed is coincidentally within the boundary that I can refine.&#x201D; Yun Yun snapped. However, the redness on her face gradually faded.</p><p>&#x201C;Yes, that&#x2019;s fine&#x2026;&#x201D; Xiao Yan nodded slightly. He voiced his thoughts, &#x201C;The Dou Qi that is left behind by that Granny Hua is really too frightening. If you can completely refine it, you might be able to reach the height of hers when she was alive. Moreover, you are still young. There is a great amount of room for you to improve. Should you end up gaining some great opportunity in the future, it is not impossible for you to even reach the Dou Sheng class.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Dou Sheng&#x2026;&#x201D;</p><p>Yun Yun was involuntarily startled when she heard this legendary height. Immediately, she shook her head helplessly. That matter was too far away. Being able to leap to the Dou Zun class during these years was already a great blessing that the heavens had given her. As for whatever Dou Sheng, she had really never thought about it.</p><p>&#x201C;I have quite a number of enemies in the Central Plains. Moreover, each of them are extremely fierce. Ha ha, if you become an elite Dou Sheng in the future, I can take shelter under this big tree of yours.&#x201D; Xiao Yan joked.</p><p>Yun Yun looked at the young face, which was covered with a warm smile, in a stunned manner when she heard Xiao Yan&#x2019;s joke. She was a little quiet and felt a heartache. Everyone could only see his glory and achievement on the surface. However, they forget just how much hard work and effort he had put in to reach this level.</p><p>When she first met Xiao Yan back then, this youth, who appeared tender but a little stubborn dared to train within the dangerous Magical Beast Mountain Range. After all the storm all these years, the danger that he had experienced was also countless number of times greater than that at the Magical Beast Mountain Range back then&#x2026;</p><p>&#x201C;I will refine Granny Hua&#x2019;s Dou Qi as soon as possible and I&#x2019;ll also spend effort to slowly control the Flower Sect&#x2026;&#x201D; Yun Yun&#x2019;s entire body appeared to have shrunk under the thin blanket as he soft voice was emitted.</p><p>Xiao Yan was startled when he heard these somewhat baffling words of Yun Yun. He watched the pretty face and finally appeared have understood something. He was momentarily speechless. A favour from a beauty was something that was most difficult to accept&#x2026;</p><p>The atmosphere within the room had suddenly become a little enchanting. A moment later, Xiao Yan let out a dry cough and broke the silence. After which, he took out a jade bottle from within the Storage Ring. Some purple-brown Danwans were stored within the jade bottle. An extremely hot energy was vaguely emitted from the medicinal bottle.</p><p>&#x201C;These are Flame Leaving Pills that I have refined. Each of them contained a trace of strength from a Heavenly Flame. You can consume one when you refine the Dou Qi of the seal in the future. It will aid you in increasing the speed of refinement. At the same time, it will also allow your Dou Qi to be refined until it is extremely pure.&#x201D; Xiao Yan placed the jade bottle gently on the bed and smilingly spoke to Yun Yun.</p><p>&#x201C;Yes.&#x201D; Yun Yun received the jade bottle and nodded with a slight smile.</p><p>&#x201C;I will leave tomorrow. If you end up meeting some trouble that you cannot resolve in the future, you can come to the Falling Star Pavilion to look for me&#x2026;&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;You are leaving tomorrow huh&#x2026;&#x201D;</p><p>Yun Yun said. The hand which she used to hold the jade bottle tightened a little when she heard this.</p><p>&#x201C;I cannot remain here for too long. Otherwise, I&#x2019;m afraid that I might end up attracting the experts from the Hall of Soul. At that time, I would end up implicating the Flower Sect.&#x201D; Xiao Yan spoke seriously.</p><p>Yun Yun was not someone who fail to see the larger picture. Although she felt some dismay in her heart, she still ended up nodding. She softly said, &#x201C;Yes, you should be careful&#x2026;&#x201D;</p><p>Xiao Yan smiled and nodded. He once again gave Yun Yun some instruction before turning around and left this lady&#x2019;s room, where a fragrance lingered.</p><p>Yun Yun&#x2019;s silver teeth bit her red lips as she watched Xiao Yan&#x2019;s back, which was leaving. She softly muttered, &#x201C;It has been so many years but I&#x2019;m still unable to get rid of this little enemy. Since I am unable to escape&#x2026; I shall put in the effort again for you.&#x201D;</p><p>Originally, Yun Yun was not really interested in increasing her strength. All she wanted to do was to find a quiet place to pass the rest of her life when she came to the Central Plains. However, who could have expected that even though this was the case, that person, who was buried deep within her heart, would once again appear in front of her...</p><p>Only when she met him again did she realise that it was impossible for this feeling to be forgotten with the flow of time. Instead, it would be brewed by time until it became increasingly mellow.</p><p>She would not say anything regarding such a feeling. All that she wanted was to remain behind him and quietly providing him some help. This was because Yun Yun was aware that Xiao Yan was carrying too much on his back. He was also too tired&#x2026;</p><p>She wanted to help share a little of his burden&#x2026;</p><p>After having resolved the problem of the seal for Yun Yun, Xiao Yan continued to remain within the Flower Sect for one day. After which, he led Qing Lin and Yun Yun to bid farewell to the First Elder of the Flower Sect.</p><p>The First Elder of the Flower Sect felt a little regretful with regards of Xiao Yan&#x2019;s swift departure. She wanted to get him to stay but seeing that Xiao Yan had made up his mind, it was inappropriate for her to stop him. All she could do was to allow the two to leave.</p><p>After saying his goodbye, Xiao Yan and Qing Lin directly left the Flower Sect. After which, the latter summoned the Nine Serene Deep Ground Python and once again hurried towards the Falling Star Pavilion.</p><p>Cloud was absent in the azure sky within thousands of kilometres. Suddenly, an enormous black figure rushed passed the distant sky with lightning like speed. A deafening rushing wind sound rumbled continuously in the sky, attracting quite a number of gazes.</p><p>This rapidly moving enormous black figure was naturally Xiao Yan and Qing Lin, who had left the Flower Sect for about two days. Both of them were basically travelling during these two days and did not take many breaks along the way. Although using the Nine Serene Deep Ground Python to travel was a little eye-catching, it would seldom attract any trouble. This was because everyone knew of the strength of the Nine Serene Deep Ground Python, which was one of the three great tribes in the Magical Beast world. Unless there was some special circumstances, otherwise no one would easily offend them.</p><p>&#x201C;Young master Xiao Yan, we have basically left the territory of the Flower Sect&#x2019;s influence. In another few days, we should be able to reach the Falling Star Pavilion&#x2026;&#x201D; Qing Lin&#x2019;s eyes swept in all directions while standing on the enormous body of the Nine Serene Deep Ground Python. After which, she turned her head and spoke to Xiao Yan, who was seated behind her.</p><p>&#x201C;Understood.&#x201D;</p><p>Xiao Yan nodded slightly. His hand rubbed the Nine Serene Deep Ground Python under him and the image of a seven coloured huge Heaven Swallowing Python flashed across his mind.</p><p>&#x201C;Cai Lin&#x2026; I wonder if your womb&#x2026; really possess the bloodline of the Xiao clan&#x2026;&#x201D;</p><p>A complicated expression flashed across Xiao Yan&#x2019;s eyes when he thought about Cai Lin. He wondered how this Queen Medusa, who had once chased after him until he was forced to flee, was. With her strength, it was likely that she would have few opponents who could match her in that region, right?</p><p>&#x201C;Young master Xiao Yan&#x2026;&#x201D;</p><p>The pretty face of Qing Lin by the side changed a little while Xiao Yan had sunk into his memory. She softly cried out.</p><p>&#x201C;What is it?&#x201D; Xiao Yan was pulled back from his thoughts by the cry. He was startled as he asked.</p><p>&#x201C;Something seems to be wrong&#x2026;&#x201D; Qing Lin softly replied.</p><p>Xiao Yan&#x2019;s eyes immediately narrowed when he heard this. His gaze slowly swept around him. At this moment, they were in the sky above a sparsely populated mountain range. However, it was surprising that there was actually not the slightest Magical Beast roar in this mountain range. It was as though the place was a death region.</p><p>Xiao Yan slowly stood up. He got Qing Lin to halt the Nine Serene Deep Ground Python. After which, his eyes paused on an empty space a short distance in front. He spoke faintly, &#x201C;Since you have come, why are you hiding yourself? Don&#x2019;t you agree... Yaohua Liangjun.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Brat, your perception is quite good&#x2026;&#x201D;</p><p>The space in front became distorted after Xiao Yan&#x2019;s words sounded. Immediately, a couple of figures appeared from nowhere. At the same time, a vast and mighty aura also spread over from all directions.</p><p>There were a total of four people who had appeared. Amongst them was Yaohua Liangjun, who had suffered a blow from the Annihilation Fire Lotus of Xiao Yan back then. The other three were all expressionless elders in gray robes. The auras of these three people were not any weaker than Yaohua Liangjun. Looking at the badge on their chest, they were surprisingly all from the Profound Sky Sect.</p><p>&#x201C;Xiao Yan, you have ruined an important matter of my Profound Sky Sect. Do you really think you can just leave like this? Do you think that my Profound Sky Sect do not dare to do anything to you just because Yao Chen had advanced to a Ban Sheng!&#x201D; Yaohua Liangjun gently flapped the foldable fan in his hand. The smile on his face contained a dense emotion.</p><p>Xiao Yan glanced at this fellow and spoke indifferently. &#x201C;You are able to wait for so long, I think that someone has informed you, right? For example, Hua Jin of the Flower Sect?&#x201D;</p><p>Xiao Yan&#x2019;s eyes turned towards the forest below after his voice sounded. A figure had appeared from that spot. It was Hua Jin from the Flower Sect. At this moment, the latter was staring at him with a face filled with murderous intent. She coldly laughed, &#x201C;You have ruined a big matter of this chief. Today, you shall use your life as compensation. As for that slut Yun Yun, this chief will finish her off sooner or later!&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Xiao Yan, just surrender and return with the old me to the Profound Sky Sect. On the account of Yao Chen&#x2019;s face, my Profound Sky Sect will treat you well. Otherwise&#x2026;&#x201D;</p><p>That gray robed elder, who was the leader, opened his mouth faintly at this moment. A dense killing intent had suddenly surged in his last sentence.</p><p>&#x201C;Otherwise, this place shall be where your bones will be buried today!&#x201D;</p>
