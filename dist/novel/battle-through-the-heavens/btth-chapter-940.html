<p><strong><u>Chapter 940: Close</u></strong></p><p>The Griffon passed through the flat plains and slowly entered the mountain range. These mountains were filled with lush-green trees. Many of the giant trees were over a thousand feet tall. Many agile monkeys were climbing and playing rough with each other within this forest. These fellows were filled with intellect, and did not hide when they saw a person. All they did was duly give them a glance. Clearly, they were already used to seeing passersby. One could see a faint spiritual aura present on these mountains. It was likely that this place was where the land veins were located, filling it with sufficient spiritual strength. It was most suitable for practitioners to train. Xiao Yan&#x2019;s group did not stop at this place. They continued to drive the Griffon over a mountain. Immediately, spacious well-connected roads in the mountain range appeared within Xiao Yan&#x2019;s sight. They were even able to see numerous figures coming and going on the main roads. Despite being this far apart, Xiao Yan was still able to hear some of the noise that was transmitted from the ground.</p><p>The sky above the mountain range did not contain this single Griffon belonging to Xiao Yan. They had just entered the mountain range when they heard the rushing sound of wind some distance away. Immediately, they saw many different shaped flying beasts flapping their wings, heading to the interior of the mountain valley. Along the way, some beasts flew close to Xiao Yan&#x2019;s group, allowing him to clearly see some human figures seated aboard the flying beast.</p><p>Xiao Yan&#x2019;s first impression of the entire mountain range was a flourishing feeling. After all, even in the sky above the &#x2018;Black-Corner Region,&#x2019; it was difficult to find so many flying beasts appearing at the same time. In this place, it seemed that flying beasts were an ordinary form of transport. However, most of the flying beasts that they saw during their journey were rank 1 or 2 Magical Beasts. There were seldom any existences that exceeded rank 3. Hence, this Griffon of Xiao Yan&#x2019;s attracted quite a number of surprised gazes. This was especially the case when they saw that there were only four people on such a big flying beast. Those surprised gazes began to reveal additional envy. It was quite difficult to find a high rank flying beast like the Griffon. Unless it was a clan or faction which possessed a rich foundation, it was quite difficult for an ordinary person to tame one.</p><p>&#x201C;It is indeed worthy of being the most prosperous city within a thousand kilometers&#x2026;&#x201D;</p><p>Xiao Yan did not mind the envious gazes. His mouth emitted a soft sigh as his foot gently stepped forward. The Griffon let out a clear eagle cry before immediately flapping its enormous wings, swiftly flying deeper into the mountain range.</p><p>The Griffon flew for over ten minutes or so before an enormous city faintly appeared behind the cover of the lush, green mountain peaks.</p><p>That enormous city was completely absorbed into Xiao Yan&#x2019;s eyes as he gradually approached. His gaze carefully observed the city size as he involuntarily nodded once again.</p><p>The Griffon came closer to the ground as Xiao Yan observed the city. Just when it was about to enter the sky of the city, however, a figure rushed over from the city gate. It immediately transformed into a yellow-robed old man.</p><p>The yellow-robed old man had quite a cold, stern face. A pair of Dou Qi wings were flapping behind his back as he stood in front of the Griffon&#x2019;s flying path. He said in a deep voice, &#x201C;Don&#x2019;t tell me that this is the first time that you have come to Horizon City? Don&#x2019;t you know that flying beasts are not allowed to enter the sky above the city?&#x201D;</p><p>With its flying path blocked, the Griffon stopped its body while emitting an eagle cry. Its enormous eyes contained a fierce aura as it stared at the yellow-robed, old man. However, it only obediently relaxed its feathered wings when Xiao Yan stomped his feet.</p><p>&#x201C;This is indeed our first time here. It is unexpected that there are actually so many rules to this Horizon City.&#x201D; Xiao Yan glanced at the yellow-robed, old man in front of him and spoke with a faint voice.</p><p>&#x201C;An expert Dou Huang?&#x201D;</p><p>The face of the yellow-clothed, old man changed slightly as he sensed the thunder-like voice resounding beside his ear. His gaze cautiously swept over the Griffon. Immediately, he was somewhat stunned to discover that other than one person, the strength of the remaining three people far exceeded his, especially the white-clothed lady&#x2019;s strength. The feeling of pressure her gaze gave caused even the flow of the Dou Qi in his body to become much more sluggish.</p><p>&#x201C;This woman&#x2019;s strength is frightening. There are only a few people even within the Luo clan who can make me feel this way! What is the motive for such a strong person to head to my Horizon City?&#x201D; Some waves rose within the yellow-robed, old man&#x2019;s heart. His face, however, became much warmer. He cupped his hands to Xiao Yan&#x2019;s group and said, &#x201C;This friend, this is indeed the rule of Horizon City over the years. There is a special place to park the flying beast that our Luo clan built for travelers at the city entrance.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Luo clan? Big brother, there are many factions within Horizon City and it is extremely chaotic. However, the one that existed for the longest time is this Luo clan. That &#x2018;Wormhole&#x2019; is also possessed by the Luo clan. There is an ancestor within the Luo clan whose strength is around that of a five star Dou Zong or so. He is the strongest in this city. If not for the existence of this ancestor, it is likely that the Luo clan would have difficulty controlling this &#x2018;Wormhole&#x2019; for so many years. After all, this extremely profitable fat meat is watched by an immense amount of people with envious eyes on a daily basis.&#x201D; Xin Lan softly explained behind Xiao Yan when she heard the yellow-robed, old man&#x2019;s words.</p><p>Xiao Yan nodded slightly. His gaze swept over the yellow-robed, old man. His strength was merely that of a two star Dou Wang or so and could barely be considered an expert. The reason they had arrived was merely to shorten their journey by using the &#x2018;Wormhole.&#x2019; He did not wish for some other problem to occur because of other matters.</p><p>&#x201C;Thank you for informing us. Additionally, I wish to ask where the Wormhole of Horizon City is?&#x201D; Xiao Yan asked with a neutral voice.</p><p>&#x201C;Friends, you have come at an unfortunate time. The Wormhole is currently under maintenance during these few days and is temporarily closed. However, the experts of my clan are trying their best to repair it. I think that it will open again soon.&#x201D; The yellow-clothed, old man shook his head, and explained the situation when he heard this.</p><p>&#x201C;Closed?&#x201D; Xiao Yan knit his brows when he heard these words. Was his luck really this bad?</p><p>&#x201C;How long will your repairs take?&#x201D; The Little Fairy Doctor slowly opened her eyes and asked in a clear faint voice.</p><p>&#x201C;I am not very sure. One hasn&#x2019;t seen the severity of the problem when it comes to repairing the Wormhole. This Wormhole of Horizon City is something built by an ancestor of my Luo clan over a hundred years ago. After being used for so many years, it is only natural that it possesses a lot of problems. We seek your understanding. If the few of you really wish to pass through, you can temporarily stay for a couple of days in the city. It should be fixed by then.&#x201D; The yellow-robed, old man, afraid of slighting the Little Fairy, hurriedly replied when he saw her open her mouth.</p><p>&#x201C;Additionally, my clan&#x2019;s ancestor is recently recruiting some elite Dou Zongs to help him repair the Wormhole together. If miss is interested, you can head to the center of the city where the Wormhole is located&#x2026;&#x201D; The yellow-robed, old man seemed to have recalled something after he had spoken and he quickly added some more information.</p><p>The Little Fairy Doctor was non-committal to the yellow-robed, old man&#x2019;s words. She randomly lowered her snow-white chin before throwing her pretty eyes to Xiao Yan.</p><p>&#x201C;Let&#x2019;s enter the city first&#x2026;&#x201D;</p><p>Xiao Yan mused a little before immediately cupping his hands to the yellow-robed, old man. With a wave of his sleeves, a wind wrapped around the Griffon and swiftly landed it on the ground.</p><p>The yellow-robed, old man bitterly laughed when he saw Xiao Yan&#x2019;s group land on the ground. He sighed, &#x201C;The problem with the Wormhole this time around is massive Otherwise, with ancestor&#x2019;s ability, he would not need to invite other elite Dou Zongs to work with him. It is not easy to hire these fellows. Not only do they have an attitude, but the rewards they wish to obtain are exorbitant... &#x201C;</p><p>Xiao Yan did not head in the direction the yellow-robed, old man had indicated and land in the so-called stopover point. He randomly found an area in the forest outside of the city and landed.</p><p>&#x201C;Return home&#x2026;&#x201D;</p><p>Xiao Yan&#x2019;s group leaped down once the Griffon landed on the ground. He looked at the Griffon which was creeping on the ground and smiled as he gave it a command.</p><p>Like it had understood Xiao Yan&#x2019;s words, the Griffon used its large head to rub Xiao Yan a couple of times. After which, it flapped its enormous wings and slowly rose into the air before swiftly disappearing into the horizon.</p><p>Xiao Yan also exhaled as he sent the Griffon off with his eyes. He waved his hands to the Little Fairy Doctor and the rest, turned around, and took the lead to walk to Horizon City.</p><p>&#x201C;Xiao Yan, the Wormhole is temporarily closed. What should we do?&#x201D; The Little Fairy Doctor followed with slow steps as she walked beside Xiao Yan. Her eyebrows were slightly knit as she asked.</p><p>&#x201C;We will first rest in the city for a night and wait to see if there is any news. If there is still no news tomorrow, we will head to the center of the city to take a look.&#x201D; Xiao Yan walked slowly and spoke with a smile.</p><p>The people present naturally did not object to Xiao Yan&#x2019;s words. Hence, all of them simply nodded.</p><p>Xiao Yan&#x2019;s group randomly found a cleaner inn after having entered the city. After which, they stayed in it. News flowed the quickest in a place like this where human traffic gathered. Such a place was the most convenient and fastest way to know what was happening in the city.</p><p>After settling the Little Fairy Doctor and the rest in, Xiao Yan took a stroll around, successfully obtaining some of the information he needed.</p><p>It was just as the yellow-robed, old man had explained. Currently, the Wormhole within Horizon City had been closed. Moreover, it seemed that the problem of the Wormhole this time around was really quite big. Even the ancestor of the Luo clan, who was a five star Dou Zong, was unable to resolve the problem in one go. Hence, he could only invite other elite Dou Zongs to aid him. However, elite Dou Zongs were extremely rare existences even in Horizon City. Additionally, the relationship of this place was extremely complicated. Moreover, this matter was also related to a valuable object like the Wormhole. Hence, the invitation by the ancestor of the Luo clan did not achieve much effect. Due to the lack of manpower, the matter of repairing the Wormhole was temporarily shelved. This caused the Luo clan to feel a great heartache. After all, their Luo clan would suffer a great loss everyday the Wormhole remained closed.</p><p>&#x201C;Looks like tomorrow&#x2026; there is a need to go and take a look. Delaying things this way is not a good thing&#x2026;&#x201D;</p><p>Xiao Yan in the room held this thought as he slowly shut his eyes and entered his daily training condition&#x2026;</p>
