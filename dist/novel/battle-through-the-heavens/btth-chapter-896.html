<p><strong><u>Chapter 896: Entering The Bottom of the Tower Again</u></strong></p><p>In an extremely bright study, a thread of moonlight shot onto the table through the bright and clean window. A table manufactured from cork tree emitted a faint wooden fragrance. On it was a flower vase made of glass where two to three stalks of flowers rested. The flowers still carried the morning dew. Two to three inkstones were placed around the table. Such treasured calligraphy was always well-liked by important people.</p><p>&#x201C;You wish to enter the bottom of the Blazing Sky Qi Refining Tower?&#x201D; Su Qian&#x2019;s hand movement immediately paused when he heard Xiao Yan&#x2019;s request. He raised his head and revealed a stunned face.</p><p>Su Qian also had some brief contact with the world at the bottom of the tower. That place was basically void of life. A place where hot magma randomly flowed, emitting various sulfur smells. Even the energy there was filled with wild violence. An ordinary person could not escape from such an environment fast enough. Who would have expected Xiao Yan to take the initiative to request to enter it? It was unavoidable that Su Qian would lose himself in such a manner.</p><p>Xiao Yan smiled in an embarrassed manner when he saw Su Qian&#x2019;s appearance. He rubbed his head and said, &#x201C;I have stYesd for a period of time at that place and know a little about the situation there. Although that place is unusually wild and violent, the fire affinity energy it contains is extremely pure. It does not lose to some energy-filled caves in the world. Moreover, the wildness and violence within the energy does not pose any threat to me. That place is the birthplace of the Fallen Heart Flame. Currently, the Fallen Heart Flame has been completely refined by me, hence I should not face any problems.</p><p>Su Qian frowned slightly upon hearing this. He placed the calligraphy brush in his hand down, mused for a moment before lifting his head, and looked at Xiao Yan&#x2019;s expression. He could only nod his head and say, &#x201C;Alright, since you insist on this request, I shall do as you say. However, I have to warn you beforehand that the magma world is not as calm as you have imagined. If anything not quite right occurs, you should hurry back. I will arrange for some Elders of the Inner Academy to guard the entrance at all times.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Thank you very much First Elder.&#x201D; Xiao Yan immediately rejoiced, smiled, and responded when he saw Su Qian nodding his head in agreement.</p><p>&#x201C;Ugh, you little fellow. You are always unable to abide by the rules&#x2026;&#x201D; Su Qian shook his head and sighed. He stood up from his chair and headed out of the study. Xiao Yan followed close behind.</p><p>After exiting the study, Xiao Yan and Su Qian slowly walked out of the Elder&#x2019;s area. They walked for some time in the Inner Academy before entering the Blazing Sky Qi Refining Tower, which had a large section protruding from the ground.</p><p>Xiao Yan involuntarily felt a kind of sobbing feeling as he once again entered this Blazing Sky Qi Refining Tower after a couple of years. Back then, when he had stepped in this place for the first time, he had been merely a little novice who had just entered the Inner Academy. Now, however, he could be barely considered to have entered the expert level. At the very least, the number of people in the &#x2018;Black-Corner Region&#x2019; who could compare with him in fighting strength could be counted on one&#x2019;s fingers.</p><p>Currently, the Blazing Sky Qi Refining Tower had lost the human traffic that came and went due to the Heart Flame being exhausted. Only a few human figures existed in the enormous space. At this moment, most of those who were still training in this place liked its serene silence. Of course, there was one other factor. Regardless of how one put it, the fire affinity energy of the Blazing Sky Qi Refining Tower was much denser than that in the outside world. After all, the enormous magma world under it was always emitting powerful fire energy. Although this energy was isolated by the thousands of feet of thick ground, some of it still managed to reach here. Hence, the current Blazing Sky Qi Refining Tower was considered a decent training area for quite a number of students who practiced fire affinity Qi Methods.</p><p>Xiao Yan and Su Qian did not stay in the first level for long. After roughly taking a look at it, the two of them headed to the bottom of the tower. They also met quite a number of students training in this place along the way. When these people saw Xiao Yan and Su Qian, all of them hurriedly greeted the two of them. Currently, the position of Xiao Yan in the hearts of these students was very high. His battle with the Old Ground Demon Ghost back then had completely subdued everyone.</p><p>Without anyone stopping them, Xiao Yan and Su Qian appeared at the lowest level of the Blazing Sky Qi Refining Tower after around ten plus minutes. Due to the eruption of the Fallen Heart Flame back then, the door of the lowest level had remained firmly locked. After the Fallen Heart Flame was subdued by Xiao Yan, this bottom level&#x2019;s defenses were no longer as tight as they had been in the past, but the door still never opened, remaining sealed until today.</p><p>&#x201C;Although the absence of the Fallen Heart Flame has brought about inconveniences, it, at the very least, has allowed one to feel much more at ease. In the past, there had always been the need to worry that it would suddenly erupt one day, causing one to feel distraught.&#x201D; Su Qian opened the large metal lock on the metal door as he turned his head to Xiao Yan and continued with a smile, &#x201C;Therefore you being able to subdue that thing can also be considered as saving us from trouble.&#x201D;</p><p>Xiao Yan nodded silently when he heard this. He understood that Su Qian&#x2019;s words were an attempt to not be bothered about the matter of him subduing the Fallen Heart Flame of the Inner Academy. Xiao Yan&#x2019;s heart was immediately slightly moved. He smiled and said, &#x201C;First Elder, relax. I will do my best to help the Blazing Sky Refining Tower create a &#x2018;Heart Flame&#x2019; that will never be extinguished.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;He he he he, it is fine if you do your best. It is fine if you do your best.&#x201D; Su Qian laughed. He did not pay too much attention to his words. The Inner Academy had already lost the Fallen Heart Flame and the &#x2018;Blazing Sky Qi Refining Tower&#x2019; that was known as a training accelerator had lost its effect. In reality, this had caused the Inner Academy to suffer. However, he was similarly aware of the importance of &#x2018;Heavenly Flames&#x2019; to Xiao Yan. Naturally, he would not speak any words demanding the flame.</p><p>Although Su Qian did not speak his thoughts, Xiao Yan did not completely fail to sense them. Honestly speaking, he felt some guilt toward the Inner Academy and Su Qian. After all, he did indeed come to the Jia Nan Academy back then because of the Fallen Heart Flame&#x2026; Now that he had achieved his aim, he had ended up bringing about a great loss to the Inner Academy. Hence, Xiao Yan&#x2019;s heart had been thinking of how to help the Inner Academy solve this problem. Although the so-called &#x2018;Flame Gathering Pot&#x2019; did indeed have a large effect, Xiao Yan, being the owner of the &#x2018;Fallen Heart Flame,&#x2019; he clearly knew that the remanent Heart Flame was ultimately a separate body and would not be as powerful as the actual &#x2018;Fallen Heart Flame&#x2019;...</p><p>Xiao Yan slowly pushed opened the heavy metal door. While the door emitted a creaking sound, hot air immediately swept out like a swarm of bees, as though it had been sealed for a countless number of years...</p><p>Su Qian extended his hand and gently waved it in front of him. He bitterly laughed, &#x201C;Just this place alone is already so hot. I really don&#x2019;t dare to imagine just how frightening it is within the magma world. Are you certain you wish to train here?&#x201D;</p><p>Xiao Yan spread his hands and inhaled a deep breath of hot energy. His face revealed a satisfied expression as he smiled and said, &#x201C;This kind of hot energy is what I need most. With the &#x2018;Heavenly Flame&#x2019; protecting my body, I need not fear an ordinary flame. First Elder, you can rest assured&#x2026;&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;You little monster.&#x201D;</p><p>Su Qian shook his head and muttered when he heard this. After which, he slowly walked into the extremely spacious final level of the Blazing Sky Qi Refining Tower.</p><p>Xiao Yan followed behind as he slowly entered. This bottom space of the tower did not have much light. A faint bright-red color filled its interior. The light originated from the middle of the room where the light radiated from a deep hole that was around a hundred feet in size. That bright-red glow was just like a light pillar that extended out, expelling the darkness in this area.</p><p>Xiao Yan&#x2019;s and Su Qian walked to the deep hole. As they came closer, the surrounding air became hotter. The fire affinity energy contained within also became increasingly pure and&#x2026; violent.</p><p>When the footsteps of the two people paused at the deep hole in the middle, the hot energy that came pouncing over nearly caused Su Qian to feel a slight searing pain. He did not practice a fire affinity Qi Method. Hence, this kind of dense singular energy was not enjoyable to him.</p><p>Xiao Yan inhaled a deep breath with all his might as he stood beside the hole. A wave of hot energy followed his nose and entered his body. Finally, it flowed within his body and caused him to swiftly become fiery hot. Xiao Yan did not know if it was an illusion, but the Fallen Heart Flame within his body had appeared much more lively at this moment.</p><p>Xiao Yan extended his head as his gaze swept over the interior of the deep hole. A bright-redness entered his eyes. A hot aura spat out of the hole, appearing as lively as a volcano. There was still quite a long distance from the entrance to the magma, but even with such a gap the hot aura remained powerful without weakening.</p><p>Studying the deep hole, Xiao Yan rolled his throat slightly. A joy that was difficult to hide was emitted from within his dark-black eyes. This was definitely a training treasure ground for Xiao Yan. If he were able to train for a period of time in this place, his strength would significantly advance.</p><p>&#x201C;Since you are confident that you can train here, I shall not stop you. Xin Lan will leave after a good period of time. Thus, you still have plenty of time to train. Hence, you need not be anxious, so take your time. Although one would decline if one does not advance when it came to training, one should do it according to one&#x2019;s capabilities. One will fail to achieve anything if one is too anxious.&#x201D; Su Qian smiled and spoke after seeing Xiao Yan&#x2019;s joyful manner.</p><p>&#x201C;Yes.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;I will help you inform your second brother, the Little Fairy Doctor, and the rest about the matter regarding you training in this place. I will also ask them not to worry&#x2026; I will dispatch a few Elders who practices fire affinity Qi Methods here later on. If any unexpected changes were to happen, they will be the first to be aware.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Thank you very much, First Elder.&#x201D; Xiao Yan smiled slightly and nodded after knowing Su Qian would arrange everything properly.</p><p>Su Qian waved his hand and said, &#x201C;Why are you still so courteous to me? Now, you can enter and give it a try. I will help stand guard by the side for a moment. If any accident were to happen, you should send a signal and I will head down to rescue you.&#x201D;</p><p>Xiao Yan once again nodded. His gaze immediately turned to the deep hole where one could not see an end. He inhaled a deep breath and clenched his teeth. Without hesitating, his body moved and leaped in&#x2026;</p><p>An exclamation was suddenly emitted from Xiao Yan&#x2019;s mouth the instant he jumped into the deep hole. An instant earlier, he seemed to have faintly sensed an extremely faint, unknown summoning feeling from far below&#x2026;</p>
