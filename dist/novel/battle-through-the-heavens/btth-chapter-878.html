<p><strong><u>Chapter 878: Three Thousand Burning Flame</u></strong></p><p>Xin Lan smiled slightly when she heard Xiao Yan&#x2019;s words. She immediately took a gentle breath, arranged her thoughts, and finally said, &#x201C;Actually, the clue regarding this &#x2018;Heavenly Flame&#x2019; that I mentioned is related to the Pill Tower. My clan once held an Elder Seat in the Pill Tower. Hence, I am also aware of some information related to it.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;The Pill Tower again?&#x201D; Xiao Yan frowned slightly upon hearing this. If the &#x2018;Heavenly Flame&#x2019; was in the hands of the Pill Tower, how could he possibly snatch it? The Pill Tower was not the Jia Nan Academy. It would definitely not allow a &#x2018;Heavenly Flame&#x2019; fall into the hands of someone else. Xiao Yan might not be aware of the exact strength of the Burning Flame Valley, but after some vague guess, he at least knew that the Burning Flame Valley was not as strong as the Pill Tower. Therefore, would he not have to choose to offend the even stronger Pill Tower? If this were the case, he would rather just place his intention on the Burning Flame Valley. Things would be a little easier that way.</p><p>&#x201C;You need not be worried about this. The Nine Dragon Lightning Flame might be a heirloom of the Burning Flame Valley and could be considered an owned object. However, the &#x2018;Heavenly Flame&#x2019; which I have mentioned is currently without an owner despite it being related to the Pill Tower. As long as you possess the ability, anyone who is fated can possess it. Even the Pill Tower would not object on this point. After all, the Pill Tower is not the Burning Flame Valley. They possess an extremely special position on the continent.&#x201D; Xin Lan explained after having sensed the thoughts within Xiao Yan&#x2019;s heart.</p><p>Xiao Yan&#x2019;s frown relaxed a little. He looked at Su Qian by the side. Only after seeing him nod slightly did Xiao Yan say, &#x201C;Be more clear about this. Additionally, since you know about all this, you should also know just what kind of &#x2018;Heavenly Flame&#x2019; it is, right?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Big brother Xiao, you can rest assured. Xin Lan believes that the &#x2018;Heavenly Flame&#x2019; within the Pill Tower will definitely interest you.&#x201D; Xin Lan laughed. She immediately raised her snow-white chin and said, &#x201C;May I ask if big brother Xiao has heard of the &#x2018;Three Thousand Burning Flame?&#x2019;&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;The Three Thousand Burning Flame?&#x201D; Xiao Yan was initially startled upon hearing this name. A heated expression suddenly erupted within his dark-black eyes. Currently, he could be considered a genuine tier 6 alchemist. Hence, his understanding of the many &#x2018;Heavenly Flames&#x2019; on the &#x2018;Heavenly Flame Ranking&#x2019; was not as lacking as it was back then. He naturally knew a little about this Three Thousand Burning Flame.</p><p>The Three Thousand Burning Flame was also called the Three Thousand Star Burning Flame. It was ranked nine on the &#x2018;Heavenly Flame Ranking.&#x2019; If one were to talk about it, it was two positions higher than Yao Lao&#x2019;s &#x2018;Bone Chilling Flame.&#x2019; This kind of &#x2018;Heavenly Flame&#x2019; was extremely ethereal and difficult to find. This was because it did not exist on the ground but was instead formed in the distant stars. The ancient text recorded that silver flames would fall from the sky when the Three Thousand Burning Flame was formed, the ground within a thousand kilometers would turn to dust, the day could not be differentiated from night, the stars would not appear, and the sun could not rise.</p><p>Due to it existing within the stars, where ordinary people had great difficulty reaching, the time the Three Thousand Burning Flame could exist was usually a little longer than the other &#x2018;Heavenly Flames.&#x2019; Hence, it was allowed sufficient to evolve. Hence, most of the Three Thousand Burning Flame that were discovered belonged to a kind of intelligent extraordinary natural being. Even if one could find it, it was extremely difficult to capture.</p><p>Of course, the thing that interested Xiao Yan the most was not the high ranking of this Three Thousand Burning Flame. Instead, it was because this kind of &#x2018;Heavenly Flame&#x2019; possessed an extraordinary and special ability. It was the legendary &#x2018;Three Thousand Star Constitution.&#x2019; Of course, this was a nicer name to call it. Most of the experts who had battled with a person who had this Three Thousand Burning Flame would call it an &#x2018;Undying Body.&#x2019; This kind of unusual name was mainly because this Three Thousand Burning Flame was able to allow the person possessing it to have a life force that was unusually tenacious. One would be like the most repulsive &#x2018;Demon Cockroach Beast&#x2019; among the Magical Beast, being able to swiftly recover from one&#x2019;s injury regardless of what kind of intense attack one suffered. The recovery of one&#x2019;s fighting strength would also swiftly rise.</p><p>Moreover, it was best if one completely killed a person with an &#x2018;Undying Body&#x2019; while they were engaged in a fight. Otherwise, as long as the other party still had a breath remaining, they would once again become a living dragon and tiger. This recovery speed depended on the seriousness of one&#x2019;s injuries. Hence, there was seldom anyone who was happy to become a life and death enemy with an expert who possessed the &#x2018;Three Thousand Burning Flame.&#x2019; After all, regardless of who it was, one would have difficulty eating and sleeping in peace if one had an enemy who possessed a life force that was as strong as a Magical Beast.</p><p>Of course, this did not mean that one would really become an undying person if one possessed the Three Thousand Burning Flame. At times, one might suffer some overly serious injuries that the Three Thousand Burning Flame had difficulty healing. Examples of this include one&#x2019;s heart, head, etc. Should these fatal points suffer a mortal wound, even the Three Thousand Burning Flame would have difficulty healing them&#x2026; this was especially the case if they met some expert whose strength far exceeded their own. The other party would likely not give one the slightest opportunity to recover and would directly eliminate them. At that time, the whatever &#x2018;Undying Body&#x2019; would not have the slightest use.</p><p>Having said that, anyone who possessed the &#x2018;Three Thousand Burning Flame&#x2019; would have a life force that would be transformed into something quite frighteningly long. This point would undoubtedly possess a great attraction to any person. After all, everyone would be happy to obtain an even more perfect guarantee of one&#x2019;s own life. Xiao Yan was no exception to this point.</p><p>The smile on Xin Lan&#x2019;s face grew even wider when she saw Xiao Yan&#x2019;s expression. She smiled and said, &#x201C;That&#x2019;s right, it is the Three Thousand Burning Flame that is ranked nine on the &#x2018;Heavenly Flame&#x2019; ranking. Is big brother Xiao interested in it?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;It is likely that any human would be interested in it.&#x201D; Xiao Yan did not hide his interest in the Three Thousand Burning Flame. He smiled and said, &#x201C;However, if this Three Thousand Burning Flame is within the Pill Tower, they would definitely protect such a rare &#x2018;Heavenly Flame&#x2019; extremely well. It is easier said than done in order to obtain it.&#x201D;</p><p>Su Qian by the side also nodded. He said in a deep voice, &#x201C;It is indeed worthy of being the Pill Tower. It even possesses a &#x2018;Heavenly Flame&#x2019; of such ranking. However, it is just as Xiao Yan has said. Even if Xiao Yan could snatch such a rare &#x2018;Heavenly Flame&#x2019; from their hands, it is likely that he will arouse their enmity. Honestly speaking, the Three Thousand Burning Flame might be rare, but it is not a wise act to offend the Pill Tower over it. After all, the strength that the Pill Tower possesses on the continent is quite great. Even your teacher back then was quite afraid of them despite having not agreed to the invitation from the Pill Tower to join them&#x2026;&#x201D;</p><p>The smile on Xiao Yan&#x2019;s face was slightly withdrawn after he heard Su Qian&#x2019;s words. He did not know much about the Pill Tower. However, he knew that they gathered the top alchemists from the continent. Moreover, it was regarded as a holy ground for all alchemists. They were definitely not some ordinary faction. Forming an enmity with them was not a wise decision.</p><p>&#x201C;Hehe, big brother Xiao need not worry about this point. If you are able to bag the Three Thousand Burning Flame, it means that you have the ability to. The Pill Tower will definitely not form an enmity with you because of this.&#x201D; Xin Lan smiled and softly explained when she saw Xiao Yan&#x2019;s manner. &#x201C;This is because the &#x2018;Three Thousand Burning Flame&#x2019; is merely discovered by the Pill Tower but is not subdued by them.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Actually, if one were to count in detail, the Pill Tower discovered the Three Thousand Burning Flame quite a while ago. During this period of time, the experts from the Pill Tower naturally attempted to subdue it. However, all of their efforts were futile. Instead, they all ended up with quite the loss when faced with the Three Thousand Burning Flame&#x2019;s retaliation. Hence, the Pill Tower could only use a sealing method to temporarily seal the Three Thousand Burning Flame. Of course, this kind of seal cannot be maintained forever. After all, that Three Thousand Burning Flame is not some ordinary being.&#x201D; Xin Lan spread her hands and spoke in a gloating manner.</p><p>Xiao Yan slowly sat back in his chair. His eyes studied Xin Lan and then indicated for her to continue speaking.</p><p>&#x201C;After both parties continued in stalemate for a period of time, the Pill Tower had also discovered that forcefully attempting to subdue this Three Thousand Burning Flame, which had already evolved to the point of possessing great intelligence, was really too difficult. Hence, after some discussion, they finally decided to distribute the qualification to subdue the Three Thousand Burning Flame out&#x2026;&#x201D; Xin Lan curled her lips and continued to explain.</p><p>&#x201C;Distribute it out?&#x201D; Xiao Yan and Su Qian were stunned when they heard this. This Pill Tower was actually willing to allow others to subdue this Three Thousand Burning Flame?</p><p>&#x201C;Of course, there is some limitation to this distribution. Every thirty years, the Dou Qi continent will hold a grand Pill Gathering that possesses the greatest influence within the alchemist world. Naturally, the only faction which has the qualification to hold this Pill Gathering is the Pill Tower&#x2026;&#x201D; Xin Lan smiled as she spoke.</p><p>&#x201C;Pill Gathering?&#x201D; Xiao Yan muttered in his mouth after being startled.</p><p>&#x201C;This Pill Gathering could be considered a rarely seen grand affair on the Dou Qi continent. Countless of geniuses from all over the continent will come and give it a try. Those who succeed will naturally be renowned throughout the world. Hehe, I remember that your teacher had obtained a champion spot in a Pill Gathering back then. It was at that time that you teacher had gradually become an extremely great person on the Dou Qi continent.&#x201D; Su Qian laughed as he explained.</p><p>Xiao Yan was once again stunned when he heard this. It was unexpected that teacher had participated in this so-called &#x2018;Pill Gathering&#x2019; before&#x2026;</p><p>Xin Lan by the side was startled when she heard these words. She immediately looked at Xiao Yan with surprise. Having come from the Central Plains, she naturally clearly knew what a champion of a season&#x2019;s &#x2018;Pill Gathering&#x2019; represented. The three great heads of the Pill Tower were all once the &#x2018;Pill Gathering&#x2019; champion&#x2026; she did not expect Xiao Yan&#x2019;s teacher to be this great. No wonder he was able to obtain such an achievement at such an age&#x2026;</p><p>&#x201C;The so-called distributed qualification is related to this &#x2018;Pill Gathering&#x2019;?&#x201D; Xiao Yan narrowed his eyes and softly asked.</p><p>&#x201C;Yes&#x2026;&#x201D; Xin Lan nodded her head. She smiled and said, &#x201C;As long as one enters the top ten within the &#x2018;Pill Gathering,&#x2019; one will be given the right to attempt to subdue the Three Thousand Burning Flame on top of the rich reward given by the Pill Tower. Whether one succeeds or not will rely entirely on one&#x2019;s ability. Therefore, if big brother Xiao Yan is confident in himself, you can go and participate in this &#x2018;Pill Gathering.&#x2019; This is the only official method to obtain the Three Thousand Burning Flame.&#x201D;</p><p>Xiao Yan slowly exhaled a breath of air when he heard this. A heated feeling slowly climbed within his heart. Being a young person, his heart possessed the prideful hope of competing with the heroes in the world regardless of how calm he usually was. This was especially the case when it involved the overwhelming allure of the &#x2018;Three Thousand Burning Flame&#x2019;...</p><p>&#x201C;Big brother Xiao, is my clue worth your guarantee?&#x201D; Xin Lan smiled slyly and asked him a question when she saw the heat in Xiao Yan&#x2019;s eyes.</p><p>The corner of Xiao Yan&#x2019;s mouth lifted up, the arc slowly widened. A moment later, he laughed loudly and nodded.</p><p>&#x201C;Yes!&#x201D;</p>
