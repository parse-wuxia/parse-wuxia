<p><strong><u>Chapter 1291: Sect Chief Position</u></strong></p><p>The thousand feet giant stood in the sky. An ocean like vast and mighty Dou Qi spread from within the body of the giant. It appeared just like a thick cloud, Wind lightning rolled while it swallowed and released.</p><p>&#x201C;Hah!&#x201D;</p><p>Yaohua Liangjun&#x2019;s face was pale. However, both of his eyes were completely dark and dense. His gaze locked onto Xiao Yan in the sky as his throat suddenly emitted and low cry.</p><p>&#x201C;Go and die!&#x201D;</p><p>The seal formed by Yaohua Liangjun&#x2019;s hand changed. The giant that stood in the sky suddenly strided forward. Following this step, a wild wind immediately blew across the entire sky. Cloud churned. Even the sky itself had fluctuated.</p><p>&#x201C;Bang!&#x201D;</p><p>The giant stepped forward. Its large hand appeared to firmly grabbed onto the naturally energy. Immediately, a shocking bright intense glow erupted on his fist. His large hand was swung and the space immediately split apart. Frightening wind mercilessly smashed violently towards Xiao Yan in the distant sky.</p><p>This punch from the giant appeared to carry the natural energy. A ferocious hurricane formed on his hand. Even the square on the ground had formed some arm thick crack lines because of this pressure. Such a shocking attack was indeed worthy of a six star Dou Zun class expert&#x2026;</p><p>Under the giant that was filled with an endless amount of pressure, quite a number of weaker Flower Sect&#x2019;s disciples had pale faces. A battle of this level was something that they seldom saw. That frightening attack that could easily destroy an entire mountain range caused their hearts to tremble.</p><p>&#x201C;This Yaohua Liangjun has also used all of his strength&#x2026;&#x201D;</p><p>Some Elders of the Flower Sect felt quietly awed in their hearts while the continued to add Dou Qi to the defence when the saw this. It was unexpected that Xiao Yan was actually able to force Yaohua Liangjun to such an extent with his two star Dou Zun strength. He was indeed worthy of being Yao Chen&#x2019;s disciples.</p><p>Yun Yun revealed a worry on her beautiful face as she stood on the square. Although her heart believed in Xiao Yan&#x2019;s strength, no one could remain calm in the face of this full force attack by Yaohua Liangjun.</p><p>&#x201C;Hu&#x2026;&#x201D;</p><p>Xiao Yan&#x2019;s figure was suspended in the sky. The bone wings on his back flapped. That powerful wind pressure that was transmitted over from a great distance firmly pressed his robe until it adhered onto his body. That rushing wind sound rumbled like a thunder beside his ear, seemingly intending on shattering his eardrum.</p><p>&#x201C;This is the full force attack of a six star Dou Zun huh&#x2026;&#x201D;</p><p>Xiao Yan gently exhaled. A glint flashed across his eyes as he softly muttered to himself. Immediately, he slowly raised his hand and the palm sized Annihilation Fire Lotus slowly rotated. This tiny exquisite lotus flower contained a true destructive force.</p><p>&#x201C;Go&#x2026;&#x201D;</p><p>Xiao Yan smiled slightly as he raised his hand. The fire lotus in it rushed out and immediately formed a beautiful firetail in the midair as it charged towards the seemingly unmatched giant.</p><p>&#x201C;Break it!&#x201D;</p><p>Yaohua Liangjun did not dare to slight the fire lotus when he saw it flashing over. His hand seal changed and the giant immediately roared towards the sky. A frightening sonic wave spread and directly formed a giant hurricane. That enormous hand was clenched and it actually forcefully grabbed the hurricane. After which, it took a large stride forward in front of everyone shocked eyes, swung the hurricane and violently smashed towards the seemingly rice grain like fire lotus.</p><p>The two collided and a momentary silence occurred. It was as though the entire world had stilled at this moment.</p><p>The silence lasted for an instant before an earthshaking explosion finally resounded over the sky in an abrupt manner. That furious thunder like explosion shook the entire mountain range.</p><p>Soon after the explosion, a firestorm swept over the sky. Under the raging fire storm, that hundred feet large giant was also torn until Dou Qi surged like a water pillar. However, these Dou Qi that had just made contact with the firestorm. However, these Dou Qi had just made contact with the firestorm when it was vaporized by the frightening high temperature into nothingness.</p><p>&#x201C;Bang!&#x201D;</p><p>The firestorm heavily collided onto the body of the giant. The vast and mighty Dou Qi that was on his body also began to swiftly disappear.</p><p>&#x201C;Bang!&#x201D;</p><p>Xiao Yan inhaled a deep breath of hot air. His body rushed backwards and a sharp cry was emitted from his mouth. Following this cry, the firestorm that was filled with a destructive force finally completely exploded at this moment.</p><p>&#x201C;Bang!&#x201D;</p><p>The frightening firestorm smashed heavily onto the giant&#x2019;s body. An incomparably strong force directly caused the giant to continuously step backwards. Even his body had vaguely become illusory.</p><p>&#x201C;Bang bang bang!&#x201D;</p><p>The fire wave that contained a destructive strength continuously spread apart. Terrifying high temperature directly caused all the moisture in this place to vaporized. Under the continuous attack by the fire wave, the giant&#x2019;s body also became increasingly illusory. At the end, it was finally exploded and turned into nothingness under this muffled sound&#x2026;</p><p>&#x201C;Puff!&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;How is this possible?&#x201D;</p><p>The giant was blasted apart and a mouthful of fresh blood was spat out from Yaohua Liangjun&#x2019;s mouth. A disbelief surged within his eyes. However, he did not have any time to be shocked at this moment. The fire wave that contained a destructive force had came rushing over with lightning like speed after forcing back the giant. If he was struck by it, it was likely Yaohua Liangjun would instantly be annihilated.</p><p>Yaohua Liangjun suppressed the shock within his heart. He clenched his teeth and circulated his Dou Qi. His body transformed into a lightning that suddenly withdrew explosively.</p><p>Yaohua Liangjun&#x2019;s speed was extremely quick. Within the blink of an eye, he had already broken through the Dou Qi barrier around the square. That fire wave also followed closely behind in front of the shocked gazes from the many Flower Sect&#x2019;s Elders. Finally, it violently collided onto the barrier.</p><p>&#x201C;Bang!&#x201D;</p><p>The enormous defensive barrier shook violently. Ripples spread rapidly. Fortunately, it did not collapse immediately. Those Elders from the Flower Sect were just about to sigh in relief after seeing this when another destructive fire wave spread. It heavily struck onto the Dou Qi barrier like an enormous hammer.</p><p>&#x201C;Crack!&#x201D;</p><p>This time around, the Dou Qi barrier had finally reached its limit. The barrier exploded amidst a cracking sound.</p><p>Having lost the obstruction of the Dou Qi barrier, the fire wave spread apart without any fear. Seeing this scene, the faces of those Flower Sect&#x2019;s disciples around the square immediately turned pale.</p><p>&#x201C;Ugh&#x2026;&#x201D;</p><p>However, when the fire wave was was about to spread across the enormous square, an elderly sigh slowly resounded over the sky. Immediately, a figure suddenly appeared in a flash. She waved her sleeve and an invisible ripple spread. Finally, the ripple collided with the fire wave. The two energies eroded each other before slowly being destroyed.</p><p>&#x201C;First Elder!&#x201D;</p><p>Seeing this figure, who had suddenly intervened, the faces of some of the Elders from the Flower Sect revealed a joyous expression.</p><p>&#x201C;Xiao Yan, are you planning to destroy my Flower Sect?&#x201D; That white haired old woman, who had suddenly appeared in the sky, looked towards Xiao Yan in the distance and spoke somewhat helplessly.</p><p>The pale face Xiao Yan was somewhat embarrassed when he heard this. He could sense the frightening strength of this white haired old woman. Immediately, he ceased daring to act impudent. He cuppedn his hands together and said, &#x201C;The situation leaves me with no choice. I hope that elder will not blame me.&#x201D;</p><p>After uttering these words, he took out a couple of medicinal pills from his Storage Ring and stuffed them into his mouth. Subsequently, he turned his eyes towards Hua Jin. At this moment, the latter&#x2019;s face was filled with horror. The eyes, which she used to look at Xiao Yan, appeared as though they had seen a ghost. She had never expect that Xiao Yan would actually be able to unleash a frightening attack that even Yaohua Liangjun was unable to receive&#x2026;</p><p>&#x201C;Chi!&#x201D;</p><p>Yaohua Liangjun&#x2019;s miserable figure had once again rushed back from the distance. His expression was dark and gloomy as he stood in the sky. It was still possible to see a trace of blood on the corner of his mouth. He understood that he had already left the area of the square and had lost the right to compete. In other words, he, Yaohua Lianjun, was defeated in the hands of a mere two star Dou Zun in front of so many people today!</p><p>The corner of Yaohua Liangjun&#x2019;s mouth twitched slightly. His face was so gloomy that it was frightening. Those gazes that were shot over from all over the place were just like needles that pierced into him, causing his entire body to feel terrible.</p><p>Xiao Yan glanced at Yaohua Liangjun in the distance from the sky. He ignored the latter and slowly landed from the sky. Without saying anything, he glanced at Hua Jin a short distance away and rubbed his hands in front of him. Four Heavenly Flames once again appeared in front of him&#x2026;</p><p>&#x201C;I admit defeat!&#x201D;</p><p>Seeing the four types of flames appearing once again, the originally pale expression of Hua Jin turned ghastly white. Even Yaohua Liangjun, someone with a six star Dou Zun strength, was unable to receive it. If she was at the receiving end, it was likely that she would not even be able to escape. Hence, she hurriedly screamed.</p><p>Xiao Yan smiled faintly upon hearing her scream. He opened his mouth and swallowed the four types of Heavenly Flames into his body. With his current strength, he did not possess the ability to continuously use the Annihilation Fire Lotus twice. It appeared that this woman was frightened by Yaohua Liangjun&#x2019;s fate.</p><p>The many Elders from the Flower Sect shook their heads slightly when they saw Hua Jin admit defeat. The match today was really a joke. A four star Dou Zun and a six star Dou Zun were defeated in the hands of a two star Dou Zun. If this matter was to spread, it would really be a source of a joke.</p><p>&#x201C;I have not disappointed&#x2026;&#x201D;</p><p>Xiao Yan turned his head. He looked towards Yun Yun, who had widened her red lips and had a stunned expression on her pretty face. After which, he coughed softly and laughed.</p><p>&#x201C;You still like to act bravely&#x2026;&#x201D;</p><p>Yun Yun watched Xiao Yan&#x2019;s face that also contained a paleness. She involuntarily glared at him. Her tone had some reprimand and a different kind of&#x2026; joy.</p><p>That First Elder from the Flower Sect in the sky also gently sighed. His eyes turned towards Hua Jin and spoke faintly, &#x201C;Since you have lost, hand the jade token of the chief to Yun Yun.&#x201D;</p><p>Hua Jin&#x2019;s hand was immediately clenched tightly when she heard this. However, she could not eat her words in public. Immediately, she could only clench her teeth and took out the jade token from her Storage Ring before ruthlessly throwing it towards Yun Yun.</p><p>The First Elder of the Flower Sect turned her eyes towards Yun Yun. She smilingly said, &#x201C;I trust the eyes of the previous chief. Yun Yun, in the future&#x2026; you will be the next chief of the Flower Sect&#x2026;&#x201D;</p>
