<p><strong><u>Chapter 1567: Life Spirit Flame</u></strong></p><p>Many people quietly started to sweat after hearing Xiao Yan&#x2019;s clear laughter. His words were relatively awful. It seemed that the Sky Mansion Alliance and the Hun clan did indeed resent each other.</p><p>&#x201C;What razor-sharp tongue&#x2026; if it is about challenging me, even your teacher Yao Chen does not possess the qualifications.&#x201D; Hun Huzi faintly laughed, but his face did not reveal the slightest anger because of Xiao Yan&#x2019;s words. It seemed that he boasted an extremely good temperament. However, the eyes he used to look at Xiao Yan were densely cold. There was a vague murderous intent surging in them.</p><p>&#x201C;Ugh, teacher said that I should be able to deal with you. Hence, there is no need for him to intervene.&#x201D; Xiao Yan fondled his [a][b]chin. The smile on his face was quite brilliant. Nevertheless, the words he spoke clearly did not give Hun Huzi any face.</p><p>&#x201C;Ha ha, in that case, I am rather curious&#x2026;&#x201D; Hun Huzi softly laughed. After which, he ceased uttering any unnecessary words. With a wave of his sleeve, a black flame erupted from his body in all direction. It formed a thousand-foot-large black fire cauldron in the sky in front of him. There was a strange devouring power vaguely emitted from the fire cauldron.</p><p>&#x201C;Nihility Devouring Flame?&#x201D;</p><p>Xiao Yan, Elder Wanhuo, and Old Man Shen Long suddenly focused their eyes. They cried out in deep voices as they looked at the fire cauldron being formed by the black flame.</p><p>&#x201C;It is unexpected that such a Heavenly Flame has actually landed in the hands of the Hun clan&#x2026;&#x201D; Old Man Shen Nong frowned. His eyes were filled with a grave expression as he looked at the black fire cauldron. Being one of the elders within the alchemist world, he was clearly aware of the might of the Nihility Devouring Flame.</p><p>&#x201C;Summon the Heavenly Flames within your bodies. My Nihility Devouring Flame craves their taste.&#x201D; Hun Huzi smiled as he looked at Xiao Yan and the other two and laughed.</p><p>&#x201C;It is merely the seed flame of the Nihility Devouring Flame, yet you actually act so domineering?&#x201D; Xiao Yan softly laughed. Although the feeling that the Nihility Devouring Flame within Hun Huzi gave him was far stronger than that of the chief of the Hall of Souls, it was still unable to reach the frightening level of the true devouring flame. Clearly, the Nihility Devouring Flame in this person&#x2019;s hand was also a seed flame.</p><p>Hun Huzi narrowed his eyes slightly upon hearing Xiao Yan&#x2019;s tone. He had not expected Xiao Yan to be able to identify the flame this quickly. However, he immediately laughed. Xiao Yan was able to recognize his Nihility Devouring Flame, but Xiao Yan was unaware that his Nihility Devouring Flame was not an ordinary seed flame.</p><p>The Nihility Devouring Flame was extremely mysterious. Only a few rare individuals were even aware that the seed flames of the Nihility Devouring Flame could be separated into different levels. Among the many ordinary seed flames were two types of mysterious seed flames. They were called the Heaven and Earth Seed Flames. The Nihility Devouring Flame in his hand was the Earth Seed Flame!</p><p>This so-called Earth Seed Flame could be considered a baby form of the Nihility Devouring Flame from a certain point of view. Its might was far from what the ordinary Seed Flame in the hands of the chief of the Hall of Souls could compare with.</p><p>Although such a Seed Flame was relatively powerful, if the mother of the flame was damaged, the many Seed Flames connected to it would automatically disappear and turn into essence energy that would gather in the main body&#x2026;</p><p>Such a matter was considered a secret. Even Yao Lao and Xiao Yan had never heard of this information. Hence, they were only able to identify the Heavenly Flame in Hun Huzi&#x2019;s hands as a Seed Flame. They could not identify that it was the boss of the Seed Flames, the Earth Seed Flame, but even if they had recognized it, Xiao Yan&#x2019;s expression would not pale. The Purifying Demonic Lotus Flame within his body had mutated after merging with so many Heavenly Flames. Forget about this Nihility Devouring Flame only being a Seed Flame. Even if the true Nihility Devouring Flame were to descend, Xiao Yan might not even fear it.</p><p>&#x201C;Whether you can swallow our Heavenly Flames will depend on your ability&#x2026;&#x201D;</p><p>Elder Wanhuo coldly snorted. He immediately waved his sleeve. A faint black wind suddenly whistled out of it. The wild wind swiftly moved through the air. If one were to look carefully, one would discover that it was not a fierce wind, rather it was a mysterious flame!</p><p>&#x201C;Nine Serene Wind Flame&#x2026;&#x201D;</p><p>Xiao Yan was a little surprised as he glance at the wild wind flame that had been summoned by Elder Wanhuo. It was not the first time he had seen this Nine Serene Wind Flame. When he had met Yao Xing Ji back then, Yao Xing Ji had been carrying this Heavenly Flame, but from the looks of it, it seemed that this Heavenly Flame had been taken back.</p><p>&#x201C;Ha ha, old man Wanhuo, you are becoming more proficient in your usage of this Nine Serene Wind Flame&#x2026;&#x201D; Old Man Shen Nong laughed out loud after seeing Elder Wanhuo summoned the Heavenly Flame. The medicine grass walking stick in his hand gently pressed down on empty space. He laughed, &#x201C;In that case, this elderly self will also have to perform&#x2026;&#x201D;</p><p>After uttering these words, the medicinal ingredient walking stick in his hand self-ignited without the presence of a flame. A liquid-like green flame slowly rose. Finally, it swelled with the wind. Layer after layer of a fog rose from the green liquid-like flame. The countless mysterious medicinal ingredients slowly grew while the fog rose. They emitted a life force, which caused one&#x2019;s expression to change.</p><p>&#x201C;This is&#x2026; the Heavenly Flame ranked fifth on the Heavenly Flame Ranking&#x2026; Life Spirit Flame?&#x201D;</p><p>Surprise flashed across Xiao Yan&#x2019;s eyes as he observed the spreading life force. A strange expression flashed through his eyes.</p><p>The Life Spirit Flame was ranked fifth on the Heavenly Flame Ranking. This Heavenly Flame was extremely mysterious because most flames were filled with a destructive force despite their many forms. However, this Life Spirit Flame, did not display an overly strong destructive force. Instead, it was filled with a life force. It was rumored that when such a Heavenly Flame was used, any medicinal ingredient seeds within it would swiftly sprout and grow. In other words, one would not need to worry about searching for medicinal ingredients with such a Heavenly Flame. As long as one possessed sufficient seeds, one would be able to obtain the medicinal ingredients one needed. Thus, this flame was extremely mysterious.</p><p>Moreover, this Life Spirit Flame was considered a longevity flame. The person who obtained it would have a lifespan comparable to those Magical Beasts famous for their long lives, but the only disadvantage was that this flame was not suitable for combat. It did not really increase one&#x2019;s fighting strength.</p><p>Xiao Yan had also heard about this Life Spirit Flame, but this was the first time he saw it. That rich tempting life force caused one to feel relaxed and full of energy.</p><p>Hun Huzi&#x2019;s eyes stared intently at the Life Spirit Flame in Old Man Shen Long&#x2019;s hands. A greed flashed across his eyes. Everything in this world possessed a limited lifespan. If one could obtain this flame of life, one would be able to greatly extend one&#x2019;s life. That allure was relatively intense even to someone like him.</p><p>&#x201C;It is actually the Life Spirit Flame. Old Man Shen Long, you are quite lucky&#x2026;&#x201D; Elder Wanhuo&#x2019;s expression was also a little envious as he stated with a smile.</p><p>When this Life Spirit Flame was formed, its intelligence would be relatively high. Normally, it would not appear in the shape of a flame. Instead, it transforms into various medicinal ingredients. After which, it simply quietly takes root in the soil. At times, it was impossible to identify it even if one were to walk past it. Only those who were extremely lucky would be able to find it in the soil.</p><p>&#x201C;Ha ha, I was merely lucky and unexpectedly found it while I was searching for medicinal ingredients.&#x201D; Old Man Shen Nong fondled his beard and smiled as he replied. Being able to obtain such a Heavenly Flame was quite a joyous thing for someone like him, who did not like to compete with others.</p><p>&#x201C;I heard that young friend Xiao Yan has subdued the rumored Purifying Demonic Lotus Flame. I wonder if this is true?&#x201D; The eyes of Old Man Shen Nong suddenly landed on Xiao Yan as he laughed. Xiao Yan was looking at the green sea of fire above his head with a strange expression from a short distance away.</p><p>&#x201C;Ha ha, I am merely just lucky like elder.&#x201D;</p><p>Xiao Yan smiled. A fire glow rose on his shoulder. Little Yi appeared in a flash. Immediately, his eyes revealed an expression of disdain as he glanced at the other three clusters of Heavenly Flames in the sky. The only one that could appear in such a form was Little Yi.</p><p>&#x201C;This is&#x2026; Heavenly Flame spirit ?&#x201D;</p><p>The few people in the sky revealed a slightly different expression upon seeing Little Yi on Xiao Yan&#x2019;s shoulder. Their eyes became a little grave. They could sense an intelligence that was not inferior to that of humans from Little Yi. Being existences that stood at the peak of the alchemist world, they naturally understood just what a Heavenly Flame spirit represented to an alchemist. The legendary Heavenly Flame constitution would allow the Heavenly Flame in the spirits hand to reach a near perfect extent.</p><p>That level was something that even people like them, whose Spiritual Strength had reached the Perfect Heavenly State, could not compare with!</p><p>Although the Heavenly Flames in their hands were quite strong, they had still yet to reach the extent of forming a Heavenly Flame spirit.</p><p>&#x201C;My Hun clan has targeted the Purifying Demonic Lotus Flame for so many years, but it has unexpectedly ended up landing in your hands&#x2026; but it doesn&#x2019;t matter. These things will sooner or later end up being taken back by us.&#x201D; Hun Huzi&#x2019;s eyes flickered while a chill surged within them.</p><p>&#x201C;Young friend Xiao Yan is really blessed. Back then, this elderly self once tried to subdue the Purifying Demonic Lotus Flame. However, I was nearly killed within the demonic flame realm&#x2026;&#x201D; Old Man Shen Nong fondled his beard and laughed.</p><p>Xiao Yan smiled. After having experienced the demonic flame realm, he naturally understood just how difficult it was to subdue the Purifying Demonic Lotus Flame. If he had not possessed a remnant of the Purifying Demonic Lotus Saint&#x2019;s soul, it was likely that he could only flee far away. Although Old Man Sheng Nong was an outstanding alchemist, one could not rely on alchemy when trying to subdue the Purifying Demonic Lotus Flame&#x2026;</p><p>&#x201C;If the four of you have prepared, please open your cauldrons and refine your pills&#x2026;&#x201D;</p><p>Yao Dan in the leader&#x2019;s seat withdrew his envious gaze from Little Yi as he spoke in a clear voice.</p><p>Xiao Yan faintly laughed after hearing command. Little Yi on his shoulder widened its mouth. A thumb-sized pink fire cauldron flew out. It swelled with the wind and turned into a thousand-foot-large fire cauldron that floated in the sky. Many fire dragons lingered around the fire cauldron. A low and deep dragon roar echoed from it, and in an instant, the temperature of the stadium swiftly rose&#x2026;</p><p>[a]Has Xiao Yan always had a beard???</p><p>[b]chin</p>
