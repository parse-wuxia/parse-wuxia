<p><strong><u>Chapter 829: Black Emperor Pavilion</u></strong></p><p>Xiao Yan softly exhaled after walking out of the Thousand Medicinal House. He studied the human traffic that was coming and going. He turned his head to look at the Little Fairy Doctor by his side as he laughed, &#x201C;It seems that we did not come in vain this time around. We unexpectedly managed to obtain some news of the Bodhisattva Body Transformation Saliva here.&#x201D;</p><p>The Little Fairy Doctor grinned. Her heart was also a little excited. Out of the three conditions required to control the &#x2018;Woeful Poison Body&#x2019;, the Bodhisattva Body Transformation Saliva was the one that was hardest to find. Now, they had actually managed to gain information about it in this place. If they could get their hands on it during the auction, it would not be long until they could control the &#x2018;Woeful Poison Body&#x2019;.</p><p>&#x201C;However, it won&#x2019;t be an easy thing to obtain the Bodhisattva Body Transformation Saliva in the auction.&#x201D; The Little Fairy Doctor recalled what that Old Yan had said earlier before frowning and sighing.</p><p>Although a simple Bodhisattva Body Transformation Saliva might not cause too many experts and factions to desire it, that mysterious Bodhisattva Heart behind it was something that would cause anyone to become crazy. Therefore, it would definitely not be an easy task to obtain the Bodhisattva Body Transformation Saliva amid an auction filled with experts.</p><p>&#x201C;We&#x2019;ll try our best. If it is really not possible, we can also do some shady things.&#x201D; Xiao Yan spread his hands and laughed. Back then, he had quietly attacked and killed that Junior Sect Leader of the Blood Sect in order to obtain the map fragment of the Purifying Demonic Lotus Flame. Killing people and snatching the treasure was basically something that was only too common in the &#x2018;Black-Corner Region&#x2019;. Xiao Yan clearly knew in his heart that there was definitely quite a number of people in this Black Emperor City who possessed the same thoughts as him.</p><p>Hence, even if someone really succeeded in auctioning off the Bodhisattva Body Transformation Saliva, it was likely extremely difficult for that person to successfully take it away without possessing genuine abilities and strength.</p><p>The Little Fairy Doctor was slightly startled when she heard the words of Xiao Yan. On the other hand, the face of Zi Yan by the side was filled with excitement. It seemed that she was extremely keen about this kind of thing.</p><p>&#x201C;He he, of course, this is the last tactic to be used. However, now we will still follow the rules. Once we have found somewhere to rest, I will need to begin refining some high tier medicinal pills. Otherwise, how will we bid against the people in the auction? According to my guess, it is likely that the Black Emperor Sect will definitely not auction this so-called Bodhisattva Body Transformation Saliva for gold coins. Most likely, they want to exchange it for something. After all, something of this level is too valuable. It is difficult for gold to measure its worth.&#x201D; Xiao Yan smiled and voiced his thoughts.</p><p>&#x201C;Yes.&#x201D; The Little Fairy Doctor nodded in agreement when she heard his words. She immediately whispered, &#x201C;Thank you very much.&#x201D;</p><p>She knew that Xiao Yan was putting in an incredible amount of effort in order to resolve the &#x2018;Woeful Poison Body.&#x2019; His acts of giving without repayment caused her heart to be filled with gratitude.</p><p>&#x201C;Why are you saying all these polite words to me now? Back then, I said that I would help you control your &#x2018;Woeful Poison Body&#x2019; and I will naturally do what I said.&#x201D; Xiao Yan was stunned before he spoke with a bright smile.</p><p>The Little Fairy Doctor gently bit her lower red lip as she slightly nodded. She did not say anything else as her heart softly muttered, &#x201C;I will remember this favor and will definitely repay you in the future.&#x201D;</p><p>After suppressing the thought that lingered deep in her heart, the Little Fairy Doctor revealed a smile. She swept her gaze over the street and softly asked, &#x201C;Where should we go next.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Let&#x2019;s go to the so-called Black Emperor Pavilion. This Black Emperor City is currently dangerous from being filled with people. We need to first find a place to stay before we can refine medicinal pills.&#x2019; Xiao Yan voiced his thoughts.</p><p>&#x201C;We are still heading for the Black Emperor Pavilion? That old fellow from earlier is someone from the Black Emperor Sect. Isn&#x2019;t it not very good if we were to head there?&#x201D; The Little Fairy Doctor spoke with some hesitation when she heard this.</p><p>&#x201C;There is nothing to worry about. With our strength, it is likely that the sect leader of the Black Emperor Sect will not come and find trouble with us just because of a minor grudge as long as he is not a fool.&#x201D;</p><p>The Little Fairy Doctor randomly nodded when she heard Xiao Yan&#x2019;s insistence. She was merely giving a reminder and did not feel much fear toward for this Black Emperor Sect. Being an elite Dou Zong, she could head anywhere on the entire Dou Qi continent. The Black Emperor Sect was not quite enough to cause her to feel afraid.</p><p>Xiao Yan randomly inquired about the directions to the Black Emperor Pavilion from a passerby after seeing that the Little Fairy Doctor had no objection. After which, he lead the other two on a slow walked to the center of the city.</p><p>The Black Emperor Pavilion was a place that was specifically used by the Black Emperor City to entertain some of the renowned experts from the &#x2018;Black-Corner Region&#x2019;. The people who were able to receive an invitation and stay in it were all experts who possessed a reputation within the &#x2018;Black-Corner Region&#x2019; or they were the heads of a certain faction.</p><p>There were guards from the Black Emperor Sect guarding a radius of around a hundred meters from where the Black Emperor Pavilion was located. An ordinary person would be immediately expelled the moment they approached.</p><p>By the time Xiao Yan&#x2019;s group had appeared at the Black Emperor Pavilion, the place had filled with many people. With his eyesight, he was naturally able to tell that these people who were clustered here were those who possessed quite a great strength.</p><p>&#x201C;It is indeed worthy of being a place entertains the strong. Those who could enter here are all extraordinary.&#x201D; Xiao Yan&#x2019;s gaze swept over the human figures who occasionally passed. He was quietly in awe. Within this less than hundred meter distance, he had sensed two expert Dou Huangs and seven Dou Wangs. Of course, most of the people were weaker than him. It was likely that they should be the servants of some faction leaders.</p><p>There was a guard wall that the Black Emperor Sect had placed not far from the Black Emperor Pavilion. A blue-robed, old man was standing there with a smile. This person seemed to have quite a high position within the Black Emperor Sect. The various experts who had arrived would smile and greet him on sight. Only then would they be allowed to enter the grounds.</p><p>Xiao Yan&#x2019;s group followed the human flow. When they were just about to enter, that blue-robed, old man continued to smile as he stepped forward. His gaze swept over Xiao Yan&#x2019;s group, and he spoke with a courteous voice, &#x201C;This place is where the Black Emperor Sect entertains VIPs. May I know if you have the tablet?&#x201D;</p><p>Xiao Yan&#x2019;s gaze gently swept over this blue-robed, old man in front of him and discovered that he was also an expert Dou Huang. Moreover, his level was around that of six or seven stars. This kind of strength could be considered a renowned strong person in the &#x2018;Black-Corner Region&#x2019;.</p><p>Xiao Yan cupped his hands to the blue-robed, old man as this thought flashed in his heart. After which, he handed over the tablet that was given by that elder at the city&#x2019;s entrance.</p><p>The blue-robed, old man received the tablet and the smile on his face grew wider. His gaze carefully swept over Xiao Yan&#x2019;s group before he smiled and said, &#x201C;The old me is an Elder of the Black Emperor Sect, Che Cheng. The three of you look unfamiliar. May I inquire about your names?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Yan Xiao, an unknown person. I have just entered the &#x2018;Black-Corner Region&#x2019; not long ago. I hurried here to join in the fun after hearing that the Black Emperor City was going to hold a large-scale auction.&#x201D; Xiao Yan faintly smiled and spoke after appearing to have sensed the surveying gaze of that blue-robed old man.</p><p>&#x201C;Ha ha, those who are able to obtain our Black Emperor Sect&#x2019;s tablet are definitely not unknown people. Little friend Yan Xiao really knows how to joke.&#x201D; Che Cheng smiled. He was naturally not going to believe Xiao Yan&#x2019;s words. At the very least, he sensed that this young person in front of him had a strength that was at least at the Dou Huang class. Moreover, he was unable to see ascertain anything about the big and small women behind him despite his eyesight.</p><p>&#x201C;Elder Che, may we enter?&#x201D; Xiao Yan was unwilling to remain in this place where people came and went for long. Hence, he smiled and asked a question after speaking a couple of words.</p><p>&#x201C;This is only naturally. Young friend Yan Xiao, there will be someone to lead you to your room once you enter the Black Emperor Pavilion. Please!&#x201D; Che Cheng smiled and nodded. He leaned his body slightly forward before moving aside to reveal the path behind him.</p><p>Xiao Yan let out a slight smile. He moved his feet and walked into the building. The Little Fairy Doctor and Zi Yan followed close behind.</p><p>A cry suddenly sounded from behind them just as the they had entered.</p><p>&#x201C;Elder Fang Yan from the Demon Flame Valley has arrived!&#x201D;</p><p>The cry that suddenly sounded caused quite a number of people present to pause. Their gazes carried some surprise as they glanced at a spot a short distance away. A large group of people were swiftly heading over from there. There was a red-haired old man who wore simple clothes in the leader&#x2019;s spot. He was striding over in a quick manner.</p><p>&#x201C;It is unexpected that the person leading the group from the Demon Flame Valley is actually this old fellow Fang Yan.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Ha ha, looks like they should be here with the aim of obtaining the Bodhisattva Body Transformation Saliva. Otherwise, since this old fellow&#x2019;s strength is about to breakthrough to the Dou Zong class, he would definitely not travel such a great distance to come here.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Looks like there will be a good show to watch this time around. There are already quite a number of top tier factions gathered in this Black Emperor City. Moreover, there are quite a number of experts with great strength. No one know just how many experts will lose their lives because of that so-called Bodhisattva Body Transformation Saliva.&#x201D;</p><p>Sounds of private conversations immediately appeared from the human traffic around Xiao Yan as people stared at the red-haired old man.</p><p>&#x201C;Is that the people from the Demon Flame Valley?&#x201D;</p><p>Xiao Yan narrowed his eyes and observed the red-haired old man. Surprise flashed across his eyes. He could sense that the strength of this First Elder from the Demon Flame Valley was actually at the peak of the Dou Huang class. It seemed that he had already taken half a step into the Dou Zong class. This kind of strength was comparable with even Han Feng back then.</p><p>Xiao Yan&#x2019;s eyes turned from the red-haired old man to the few people beside him. He discovered that the few cold and indifferent looking old men were all at the Dou Huang class. Their strengths were not any weaker than that Fourth Elder Xiao Yan finished off a couple of days ago.</p><p>&#x201C;No wonder this Demon Flame Valley is able to fight with the Jia Nan Academy. Their strength is indeed strong.&#x201D; Surprise flashed across Xiao Yan&#x2019;s face. He quietly spoke to himself after seeing this lineup of the Demon Flame Valley.</p><p>&#x201C;The gray-robed person who is walking at the back seems to be a little strange.&#x201D; The Little Fairy Doctor by his side softly whispered while Xiao Yan was deep in thought.</p><p>Xiao Yan was startled when he heard this. His gaze moved before finally resting on the last person in the Demon Flame Valley&#x2019;s group. There was a human figure completely wrapped in a gray robe there. Xiao Yan&#x2019;s eyes had scanned that person earlier. However, his aura was far too weak, to the point that he did not pay him much attention. Now that the Little Fairy Doctor had pointed him out, Xiao Yan finally sensed an extremely strange yet somewhat familiar feeling from him.</p><p>This feeling caused Xiao Yan to knit his eyebrows together. He mused for a moment, but did not think of any clues. All he could do was to shake his head and give up.</p><p>A coldness flashed across Xiao Yan&#x2019;s eyes as his gaze once again swept over First Elder Fang Yan who was chatting and smiling with the Elder from the Black Emperor Sect. He immediately turned and walked into the Black Emperor Pavilion without staying any longer.</p><p>The moment Xiao Yan turned his body, the last gray-robed person at the back of the group from the Demon Flame Valley raised his head after having sensed something. A pair of dense and violent eyes peered out from under the gray robe. He stared at Xiao Yan&#x2019;s back as an uncertainty flashed through his eyes&#x2026;</p>
