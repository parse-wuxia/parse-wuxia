<p><strong><u>Chapter 663: Recover</u></strong></p><p>In order to wake Yao Lao up this time around, Xiao Yan not only had to squeeze out all the Dou Qi within his body until it was completely empty, but his Spiritual Strength had also suffered quite the blow. Hence, it was still quite difficult for him to recover to his peak condition within a short period of time despite the fact that the &#x2018;Flame Mantra&#x2019; had already evolved into a Di class Qi Method.</p><p>However, it was fortunate that Yao Lao had already reawakened. With this safe guardian, Xiao Yan no longer needed to worry about other matters disturbing him. Hence, he was able to completely relax and enter into his training mode to recuperate. There was no longer a need to worry about the slightest influence from the outside world.</p><p>Through this kind of quiet recuperation, which was void of any distractions, Xiao Yan&#x2019;s empty body was gradually filled by waves of Dou Qi flowing in. His weariness was becoming fainter with each day. From the looks of his progress, his body would be completely healed soon.</p><p>A black-robed, young man sat cross-legged on a quiet mountain peak within the lush, green mountain forest. His body was as stable as a rock. He did not make the slightest movement, even allowing the wild wind to cause his robes to emit a fluttering sound.</p><p>There was a fluctuation in the air around the black-robed, young man. Waves of natural energy seeped out around him before flowing unceasingly into his body. Due to the speed of the surging energy being too fierce, it ended up appearing to form an energy whirlpool around his body. The middle of that whirlpool was that body which was just like a bottomless pit.</p><p>This form of energy absorption continued for nearly an hour or so before this momentum was gradually reduced. A moment later, the gradual ripples of the energy swirl finally began to slowly scatter.</p><p>The young man&#x2019;s unmoving body trembled slightly with the scattering of the energy swirl. His tightly shut eyes were suddenly opened!</p><p>Xiao Yan opened both of his eyes. The two substance-like clusters of dark-green flame shot out from within. An instant later, however, the flame emitted a &#x2018;suo&#x2019; sound and shrank back into his eyes before the light swiftly faded away.</p><p>&#x201C;Hu!&#x201D;</p><p>A mouthful of turbid air that had been suppressed in his chest followed the rolling of his throat, and was eventually exhaled by Xiao Yan. A layer of faint jade-like luster surfaced on Xiao Yan&#x2019;s face as this turbid air was exhaled. The weariness that was hidden between his brows over these past days had also completely disappeared at this moment.</p><p>Xiao Yan clenched his hand slowly but tightly. The feeling of being filled with strength caused the corner of Xiao Yan&#x2019;s mouth to involuntarily form a smile. Through these nearly seven days of recuperation, he had finally completely recovered from the exhaustion of the Dou Qi within his body as well as the blow that his spirit had received. Moreover, he had reaped an unexpected reward. Just before he had stopped earlier, Xiao Yan clearly felt a faint feeling the Dou Qi in his body becoming a little more powerful than before.</p><p>Although he was still at the peak of the Dou Wang class, each level had a difference between the upper and lower levels. It was just like a water bottle with a level scale. Although the water within it had reached the level of a certain marking, there was still quite a large gap between this marking and the next one above. The increasingly more powerful Dou Qi was just like the repeatedly rising water. Sooner or later, it would rise to an even higher marking. At that time, it would be the moment that Xiao Yan broke through to the Dou Huang class!</p><p>Due to the soaring of his strength in the past and Xiao Yan falling into a near death state for two years, he had difficulty controlling the strength within his body perfectly after he had awakened. Hence, Xiao Yan had appeared to have entered a dead end all this time. It was difficult for his strength to rise even a little regardless of how he trained...</p><p>However, after these past two months where he had completely used all the Dou Qi within his body, the control and familiarity Xiao Yan had over the strength within his body had greatly increased. It was because of this that he felt that his strength had advanced now that he had completely recuperated and recovered his strength. This kind of situation was something that was very difficult to do in the past. However, once it did appear, it meant that the current Xiao Yan had already begun to control the strength within his body and had reached the qualification for his strength to continue to rise.</p><p>Xiao Yan also clearly understood this point within his heart. It was this reason that caused him to feel such joy when he felt his strength advance.</p><p>Xiao Yan stood up from the huge rock. He looked down at the sea of trees that spread to the edge of his sight from a high vantage point. With a slight smile, his hand habitually formed an extremely familiar strange seal and immediately gently pushed it forward.</p><p>The hand seal was pushed forward and carried a wind. Of course, Xiao Yan would naturally not randomly use the &#x2018;Open Mountain Seal&#x2019; due to the overly great exhaustion of his Dou Qi to do so. Hence, this particular &#x2018;Open Mountain Seal&#x2019; did not bring about any activity. Despite not using any Dou Qi, the air still gently rippled wherever the hand seal passed. Although the ripple was extremely small, it was stirred by completely relying on the mysterious hand seal.</p><p>&#x201C;Although I have practiced this &#x2018;Open Mountain Seal&#x2019; for such a long time, I am still only barely able to grasp it. It is indeed worthy of being a Di Class High Level Dou Technique. One faces many difficulties practicing it.&#x201D;</p><p>Xiao Yan slowly undid his hand seal, and a faint silver-colored glow suddenly surged on his feet. His body trembled, and an afterimage remained in the original spot. His body had quietly rushed into the sky in a ghost-like manner. The mystery of the &#x2018;Three Thousand Lightning Movement&#x2019; was such that Xiao Yan was actually able to pause for a short moment in the sky even without the support of a pair of Dou Qi wings.</p><p>Xiao Yan&#x2019;s figure paused for a moment in the sky. A pair of beautiful jade-green wings shot out from Xiao Yan&#x2019;s back. He flapped them gently and stabilized his descending body.</p><p>&#x201C;The current &#x2018;Three Thousand Lightning Movement&#x2019; should have already reached the second level, the Instant Lightning level. I really don&#x2019;t know when I will be able to enter that final level &#x2018;Three Thousand Lightning&#x2019;...&#x201D; Xiao Yan lowered his head and studied the flickering threads of lightning under his feet before he sighed and spoke. He really yearned for that level in which he obtained the frightening speed that Yao Lao had mentioned upon complete mastery of the &#x2018;Three Thousand Lightning Movement&#x2019;.</p><p>&#x201C;Ke ke, little fellow, have you finally recovered your strength&#x2026;&#x201D; Yao Lao&#x2019;s laughter suddenly sounded while Xiao Yan was musing. The sound of rushing wind immediately sounded as a somewhat illusionary human figure appeared in front of Xiao Yan.</p><p>Xiao Yan smiled and nodded as he faced the smiling Yao Lao in front of him.</p><p>&#x201C;Looks like not only have you completely recovered from your injuries, but your strength has also advanced.&#x201D; Yao Lao raised his brows as he observed the little glow that was hidden in Xiao Yan&#x2019;s dark-black eyes. He spoke in a somewhat surprised manner. Currently, he had already known about the situation where Xiao Yan&#x2019;s strength had soared when he was underground. Hence, he felt quite surprised that Xiao Yan was able to completely control the strength within his body and allow his strength to increase once again within such a short period of time.</p><p>&#x201C;It has been quite a couple of months since I have left the &#x2018;Blazing Sky Qi Refining Tower&#x2019;. Would I have the qualification to return to the Jia Ma Empire if I am still unable to control my own strength?&#x201D; Xiao Yan smiled as he replied</p><p>&#x201C;The Jia Ma Empire huh&#x2026; ke ke, it is really unexpected that in the blink of an eye, we been away from that empire for over three years.&#x201D; Yao Lao laughed softly.</p><p>&#x201C;That&#x2019;s right&#x2026; three years.&#x201D; Xiao Yan faintly smiled. In the first three years, he had received the humiliation from Nalan Yanran breaking off the engagement. In the second three years, he was chased after by the Misty Cloud Sect until he was like a dog that had lost its home, and was forced to flee from the empire in a miserable manner. However, he had already completely repaid the humiliation from the first three years. This second one&#x2026; might not be long.</p><p>&#x201C;When are you planning to return? With your current strength, you already possess the qualifications to challenge the Misty Cloud Sect.&#x201D; Yao Lao&#x2019;s gaze was filled with gratitude as he observed the young man in front of him. He felt like sobbing in his heart. He recalled the young man back then who needed to always borrow his strength in order to mix with the upper echelons of the Jia Ma Empire. Now, he truly possessed the strength of someone strong. Two kinds of &#x2018;Heavenly Flames&#x2019;, a Di class Qi Method, and various kinds of profound Dou Techniques by his side. The Jia Ma Empire could no longer restrain him!</p><p>&#x201C;Soon. I can leave once I have settled some issues in this place.&#x201D; Xiao Yan smiled as he replied softly, &#x201C;Currently, I also have some strength within the &#x2018;Black-Corner Region&#x2019;. This time around, I will be bringing quite a number of experts back. The Misty Cloud Sect has many strong people. Moreover, it also possesses quite the strong gathering ability within the Jia Ma Empire. If I were to return alone, it would be difficult for my pair of fists to defeat four hands. It is fine if it is me alone. If I cannot defeat them, I can turn around and flee. However, the members of the Xiao clan remaining within the Jia Ma Empire cannot. Hence, there must be no accident this time around.&#x201D;</p><p>Yao Lao studied the smiling young man in front of him with some surprise. A moment later, he patted the latter&#x2019;s head and spoke in a pleased voice, &#x201C;Little fellow has indeed grown up. You are no longer that impulsive child you were back then. You are now actually able to gather such deep thoughts about the entire situation.&#x201D;</p><p>Back then, Xiao Yan had descended into fury because of his father&#x2019;s disappearance. He senselessly charged up to the Misty Cloud Sect once again and killed the First Elder Yun Leng, who was the only one who could have known where his father was. Not only did he end up completely losing the trail of his missing father, but he had also caused the relationship between both parties to completely break apart and break down to the extent where they were now mortal enemies. This was indeed rather reckless. Compared to himself back then, not only did the strength of the current Xiao Yan progress greatly, but his character had also become much more mature and cool.</p><p>In three years, the young man back then had transformed into a strong person who truly had the ability to act independently!</p><p>&#x201C;Teacher, thank you very much for what happened in the past.&#x201D;</p><p>Xiao Yan was also somewhat embarrassed in the face of Yao Lao&#x2019;s words. Now that he recalled what happened back then, he had indeed committed quite a number of reckless acts. Yao Lao had not only not tried to persuade him otherwise, but had instead accompanied him as he went on a rampage. Now that he thought of it, Xiao Yan did not have anything but gratitude in his heart toward this teacher who had performed his duty to the best of his ability.</p><p>&#x201C;Brat, why are you saying such words now. Can a young person be called a young person if he is not impulsive and reckless?&#x201D; Yao Lao slapped his hand on Xiao Yan&#x2019;s shoulders and scolded with a smile.</p><p>Xiao Yan also smiled slightly when faced with Yao Lao&#x2019;s relieved, happy smile. He slowly turned around and threw his gaze to the distant north. There was an empire thousands of kilometers in that direction called the Jia Ma Empire. In it was a sect called the Misty Cloud Sect!</p><p>&#x201C;Misty Cloud Sect&#x2026; just wait. Soon, we will meet again&#x2026;&#x201D;</p><p>A faint, cold smile formed on the handsome face of the young man as red sunlight from the setting sun landed on it.</p>
