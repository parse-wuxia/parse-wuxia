<p><strong><u>Chapter 1384: Nine Changes to turn Sheng</u></strong></p><p>A solemn expression flashed across Xiao Yan&#x2019;s eyes as he sensed the fourth Tianzun&#x2019;s soaring aura. This person possessed some ability to form such a fierce name for himself within the Central Plains. The fourth Tianzun&#x2019;s current aura had clearly surpassed that of an ordinary expert at the peak of the Dou Zun class&#x2026;</p><p>Of course, this did not mean that the fourth Tianzun had already reached the Ban Sheng class because such a thing was impossible. There might only be a step from the peak of the Dou Zun class to the Ban Sheng class, but this step was as vast as the sky. The gap between the two was so terrifying that it was difficult to describe. This could be seen from the way Yao Lao&#x2019;s strength had remained at the peak of the Dou Zun class for many years. It wasn&#x2019;t until he borrowed the strength from his new body to break through. Regardless of how frightening one&#x2019;s talent was, trying to reach the Ban Sheng class was not an easy task&#x2026;</p><p>This short step was one that countless of talented individuals hated and failed. They would feel an incomparable regret until the moment they died.</p><p>The reason that this occurred was because this short one step hid a unique training method. Only those experts who had approached this level would be able to sense this kind of unique training.</p><p>Some of the top experts in the Central Plains region called this unique training method the Nine Changes to turn Sheng (Saint)!</p><p>The so-called nine changes could be considered a quantifier to measure the gap between the peak of the Dou Zun class and the Ban Sheng class. After all, the gap between the two was really too terrifying. One needed to use an even finer ranking system with enormous positions between levels to differentiate the difficulty&#x2026;</p><p>The nine changes were not complicated. Simply put, they were considered nine compressions and suppressions. The moment the Dou Qi within the body of an expert at the peak of the Dou Zun class showed signs of being full and could no longer be increased was the moment the nine changes began. One would then need to shrink and suppress the Dou Qi within one&#x2019;s body. Only then would the interior of one&#x2019;s body have enough space to accept new Dou Qi&#x2026;</p><p>One needed to perform this compression once the Dou Qi became filled again!</p><p>This cycle would repeat and only after nine suppressions would it reach a complete state.</p><p>The Dou Qi within one&#x2019;s body would experience a change in quality under each compression. Only then would one cross over the unmeasurable sky-like gap and advance to the Sheng class!</p><p>Due to this, some of the experts, who had reached this stage, would describe the training hidden at the peak of the Dou Zun class as nine changes.</p><p>One could only become a Sheng (Saint) after nine changes!</p><p>It was easy to talk about these nine changes, but they would really test one&#x2019;s limits. Just imagine the frightening amount of Dou Qi an expert at the peak of the Dou Zun class could contain. That needed to be filled and filled nine times. Such a requirement was indeed worthy of the description &#x2018;horrifying.&#x2019;</p><p>Although the ninth Tianzun from earlier was also at the peak of the Dou Zun class, he was a one change peak Dou Zun. He was even a little weaker than Xiao Yan after he had activated the clan tattoo. After having absorbed so much energy from the fresh blood, the fourth Tianzun had soared to the third change. Of course, the Ban Sheng class was still far enough away that it was difficult to feel. If the fourth Tianzun reached the Ban Sheng class, Xiao Yan would not have a chance of victory!</p><p>The fourth Tianzun&#x2019;s eyes also became scarlet with his soaring aura. Although this Blood Transforming Great Skill was able to absorb the energy from the blood of a person, the sequela was quite serious. Within one month of using it, the fourth Tianzun&#x2019;s body would enter a state where he was close to death. Even someone at the Dou Wang class would easily be able to kill him. Therefore, the fourth Tianzun would usually not dare to use this Secret Technique unless he had no choice, but for this current situation, he would not only fail his mission if he did not activate it, he would also be defeated by Xiao Yan. This was something that he could not endure&#x2026;</p><p>&#x201C;Roar!&#x201D;</p><p>His scarlet eyes stared at Xiao Yan. A dense smile surfaced on his face as a chilling roar was emitted from his throat.</p><p>&#x201C;Chi chi!&#x201D;</p><p>Waves of frightening blood-colored fog surged from the fourth Tianzun&#x2019;s body in all directions after he roared. It gathered into a thick blood cloud as a stench spread from it&#x2026;</p><p>Xiao Yan frowned as he stared at the bloody cloud in the sky. He could sense the frightening energy that had gathered within the bloody cloud, and he did not dare to slight it. His hand rubbed in front of him and four clusters of Heavenly Flames appeared. A high temperature quickly spread when these Heavenly Flames appeared. They incinerated the surrounding stench&#x2026;</p><p>Xiao Yan inhaled another breath of air after summoning the four clusters of Heavenly Flames. His hand seal changed and a cluster of gray flames was spat out of his mouth. This flame might not be as strong as those four Heavenly Flames, but it emitted an extremely powerful aura. This was the fake Heavenly Flame that Xiao Yan had refined, Life Transforming Flame!</p><p>&#x201C;Five Ring Flame Expelling Technique!&#x201D;</p><p>A low and deep cry was emitted from Xiao Yan&#x2019;s mouth as the five clusters of flames in front of him suddenly soared. They turned into five thousand feet large fire spirits and gave off many loud beast roars above Xiao Yan&#x2019;s head.</p><p>&#x201C;Gather!&#x201D;</p><p>The fire spirits quickly took shape. Xiao Yan once again coldly cried out. Five enormous fire spirits formed a mysterious formation and began to rapidly rotate. Finally, it turned into a couple hundred feet across five-colored fire coil with a buzzing wind. It rotated wildly above his head as a hot wind spread. The bloody cloud in the distance began to fluctuate.</p><p>&#x201C;Hmph!&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Bloody Evil Sky Demon Palm!&#x201D;</p><p>The fourth Tianzun let out a cold snort when he saw this from afar. He widened his mouth and a blood pillar shot out. It shot into the bloody cloud in the sky, and the cloud&#x2019;s color immediately dimmed. The blood cloud churned and suddenly burst apart. A ten-thousand-foot-large blood palm shot from the blood cloud in front of a countless number of shocked eyes. It ruthlessly slammed toward Xiao Yan.</p><p>The might of the blood palm was extremely frightening, and an enormous palm outline appeared on the distant ground when it was still ten thousand feet in the air&#x2026;</p><p>&#x201C;Xiao Yan, watch how this venerable self shall slam you into dust!&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;What arrogant words!&#x201D;</p><p>Xiao Yan&#x2019;s eyes turned cold when he heard the explosive cry that was suddenly emitted from the fourth Tianzun. His hand seal immediately changed, and a low cry was emitted from his mouth, &#x201C;Five Ring Flame Expelling Coil!&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Buzz buzz!&#x201D;</p><p>The enormous five-colored fire coil in the sky suddenly shot forth after Xiao Yan&#x2019;s cry sounded. Within a couple of flashes, it tore through empty space and ruthlessly collided with the huge blood palm.</p><p>&#x201C;Bang!&#x201D;</p><p>The two collided in a frightening manner, and a cold blood and hot flame exploded in the sky. Terrifying energy swept apart in front of many shocked eyes. At this moment, even the clouds had been forcefully shattered into dust&#x2026;</p><p>The fourth Tianzun narrowed his eyes as he watched a frightening energy hurricane form in the sky. He had just pulled back by some distance when a chill was transmitted from behind him. He suddenly turned his head, and a face that contained an icy smile appeared within his eyes!</p><p>&#x201C;Xiao Yan?&#x201D;</p><p>Seeing Xiao Yan suddenly appear behind him, the fourth Tianzun&#x2019;s abruptly shrank despite his attitude. He had failed to sense just when Xiao Yan had moved.</p><p>&#x201C;Great Heaven Creation Palm!&#x201D;</p><p>A strange smile surfaced on Xiao Yan&#x2019;s face when he noticed the fourth Tianzun&#x2019;s shock. His right hand violently slammed forward without any hesitation, and a dark-black light circle was formed with lightning-like speed.</p><p>&#x201C;Blood demon robe!&#x201D;</p><p>Shock surfaced in fourth Tianzun&#x2019;s heart while he faced Xiao Yan&#x2019;s ferocious attack. Fortunately, he was not an ordinary person. Blood immediately flowed through his pores and quickly formed a thick cuticle layer on his body.</p><p>&#x201C;Bang!&#x201D;</p><p>Xiao Yan&#x2019;s palm wind was just like lightning as it ruthlessly smashed into the fourth Tianzun&#x2019;s body. An incomparable wind caused the blood cuticle on the fourth Tianzun&#x2019;s body to crack an inch at a time.</p><p>&#x201C;Grug!&#x201D;</p><p>Although there was the blood demon cuticle blocking the attack, the remnant wind still forced the fourth Tianzun to spit out a mouthful of blood. His body borrowed this push to quickly fly backwards.</p><p>&#x201C;Trying to leave?&#x201D;</p><p>The fourth Tianzun&#x2019;s body had just flown back when a cold smile slid across Xiao Yan&#x2019;s face. Xiao Yan had finally managed to launch a sneak attack by using the opportunity created by the Dou Qi void within the fourth Tianzun&#x2019;s body after he had used the Bloody Evil Sky Demon Palm earlier. How could Xiao Yan allow him to leave unharmed?</p><p>The green-red ancient wings on Xiao Yan&#x2019;s back flapped[a][b][c]. His body appeared to have teleported as it appeared in front of fourth Tianzun, who was flying backwards. Xiao Yan reached out with his hand and four clusters of flames appeared. Soon after, an extremely beautiful fire lotus was formed in his palm.</p><p>&#x201C;It&#x2019;s over!&#x201D;</p><p>A ferociousness appeared on the corner of Xiao Yan&#x2019;s mouth as he observed the shock that had surged onto the fourth Tianzun&#x2019;s face.</p><p>The fourth Tianzun&#x2019;s heart became icy-cold when he saw the ferociousness on Xiao Yan&#x2019;s face. Each of those three Dou Skills that Xiao Yan had unleashed possessed a strength that was at the Tian class Dou Skill level. The perfect combination of those three Dou Skills caused even him to be unable to retaliate!</p><p>&#x201C;No wonder so many experts from the Hall of Souls have fallen to this brat&#x2019;s hands&#x2026;&#x201D;</p><p>While the fourth Tianzun was feeling extremely regretful of accepting this easy but extremely dangerous task, the fire lotus in Xiao Yan&#x2019;s hand had been propelled forward without any hesitation. It ruthlessly struck onto the fourth Tianzun&#x2019;s body.</p><p>&#x201C;Bang!&#x201D;</p><p>The moment it struck the fourth Tianzun, a terrifying firestorm swept over the sky like a celebratory firework in front of a countless number of eyes the moment it struck fourth Tianzun&#x2026;</p><p>[a]Weren&apos;t they crystal clear with only a faint color?</p><p>[b]Actually, I am not certain. The author repeatedly changes things and even I end up getting lost</p><p>[c]I think the most recent chapter that mentions them is when they go to the Dou Sheng&apos;s temple thing. I think they were described as crystal clear then. Yeah, he always seems to be forgetting things and changing things up. Like randomly adding this nine changes thing.</p>
