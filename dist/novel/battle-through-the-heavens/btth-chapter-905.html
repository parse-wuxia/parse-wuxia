<p><strong><u>Chapter 905: The Activity of the Tuo She Ancient God Jade</u></strong></p><p>A great soul-stirring wave rose within Xiao Yan&#x2019;s heart. However, there was not the slightest change on his face. The hand under his sleeve gently caressed the Tuo She Ancient God Jade, and he immediately inhaled a deep breath of air. The ancient jade, which had not exhibited any activity for a long time, had an unusual movement appearing at this moment. A wave of faint-redness rose up on the white-colored jade&#x2019;s body. Clearly, it was due to this magma area&#x2026; or more accurately speaking, the magma world below&#x2026;</p><p>Xiao Yan&#x2019;s heart felt eighty percent confident that there seemed to be some existence that was related to the Tuo She Ancient God Jade at the bottom of the magma world where one had difficulty seeing!</p><p>A boiling feeling quietly rose within Xiao Yan&#x2019;s heart when he recalled what Xun Er had said back then. This Tuo She Ancient God Jade was left behind by an elite Dou Di. Dou Di, the expert that stood at the peak of this world. The kind of strength that an expert who had obtained that level possessed was something that Xiao Yan had never personally witnessed. However, he could still vaguely guess it had been frightening enough to able to shake the Heavens and Earth with one&#x2019;s hand.</p><p>Something that was left behind by such an elite Dou Di was sufficient to stir a bloody storm within this Dou Qi continent. Of course, the thing that was left behind must also possess the qualification to stir this chaos.</p><p>Simply put, if Xiao Yan was able to obtain whatever item that was left behind by a Dou Di, he might possess the capital that could enable him to truly contend with the &#x2018;Hall of Souls!&#x2019;</p><p>This point was very attractive to Xiao Yan.</p><p>Xiao Yan&#x2019;s body was like a fish as he quietly cut through the magma. His eyes involuntarily glanced behind him. The crimson magma covered his sight but he could still vaguely see a dark-blackness that caused one to fear the bottom of the magma world. That place might possess a bit of information related to the Tuo Shi Ancient God.</p><p>The fiery heat in Xiao Yan&#x2019;s eyes continued for a moment. When Xiao Yan gradually recovered from the shock, he slowly emitted a breath. The fiery heat slowly scattered. He did not turn his body around and head to the bottom of the magma even though he knew that place could attract the attention of the Tuo She Ancient God Jade.</p><p>This was because he also understood just how dangerous that place was. The current him did indeed require strength to rescue his father and Yao Lao. However, the precondition was that he must remain alive. Of course, Xiao Yan had done many things that put his life at stake in the past. However, he always had a bottomline. This time around, if he were to immediately turn around and enter that mysterious magma bottom, Xiao Yan was not confident that he could escape alive&#x2026;</p><p>If he were to lose his life, a great strength would no longer be of any use! He was no longer that reckless young man from years earlier. He knew what things were worth doing and how to go about doing them.</p><p>Moreover, the Tuo She Ancient God Jade was a key that opened the thing that the Tuo She Ancient God had left behind. What could he do if the thing that existed at the bottom of the magma was really something left behind by the Tuo She Ancient God? Xiao Yan clearly understood that the key in his hand was merely a portion of the complete key. By holding a key fragment, it was likely that he could only watch the thing and sigh even if he managed to obtain what was left behind by the Tuo She Ancient God.</p><p>With his current strength, Xiao Yan was unable to even barge through the fire lizard people, much less the frightening existence that even Tian Huo zun-zhe was afraid of be. He might end up with the miserable ending of returning empty-handed after paying a hefty price. This kind of price was not something that Xiao Yan could afford.</p><p>Many thoughts flew around Xiao Yan&#x2019;s heart, causing Xiao Yan to gradually calm down. He clenched his teeth and forcefully turned his head around. After which, he returned the ancient jade in his Storage Ring without leaving a trace. At this moment, his body still had the soul of Tian Huo zun-zhe. This person was not Yao Lao. Something like the Tuo She Ancient God Jade, which was enough to arouse the envy of an elite Dou Zun, must never be leaked to anyone else. Hence, Xiao Yan firmly locked whatever happened in this place in his heart. Perhaps when he possessed a genuine strength in the future, he would be able to openly return to this magma world and investigate it!</p><p>However, that time was definitely not now!</p><p>He had to guard this secret alone. He knew that if this matter were to spread, the Jia Nan Academy would never experience a peaceful day again!</p><p>Xiao Yan slowly suppressed the excitement in his heart. His sleeves shook violently and Dou Qi spat from then. His swimming speed abruptly quickened. With the Tian Huo zun-zhe hiding the flow of the magma, he could increase his speed without fear since he would not be sensed by those fire lizard people.</p><p>With the help of Tian Huo zun-zhe this time around, Xiao Yan&#x2019;s journey was extremely smooth. Around ten plus minutes later, he left the area where the fire lizard people existed. The temperature and pressure within the magma at this moment had also weakened. Clearly, he was not far from the surface of the magma sea.</p><p>Xiao Yan slowly sighed in relief within his heart. He looked at the brightening magma above before immediately lowering his head. Looking at the magma world behind him, he muttered in his heart, &#x201C;I will return again&#x2026;&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Splash!&#x201D;</p><p>The quiet surface of the magma sea was void of wind and waves. There was only the slight sound of bursting bubbles. The entire magma world was still that quiet. Suddenly, a sound of something breaking through the surface of water sounded. Immediately, a human figure, whose entire body was wrapped within a green-colored flame, rushed out of the magma. Finally, the figure floated in mid-air. The figure&#x2019;s panting face revealed a smile after having narrowly escaped death.</p><p>&#x201C;I have finally left that damn place&#x2026;&#x201D; Xiao Yan wiped the cold sweat off his forehead and involuntarily smiled. Exploring underground this time around had been really risky. However, it was fortunate that he had obtained a benefit that was completely comparable to the risk. Not only did he completely resolve the worries regarding the Blazing Sky Qi Refining Tower, but he had also obtained a fire control skill that was comparable to a Tian class Dou Technique upon skill mastery. Of course, the most important thing was that Xiao Yan had once again gained the soul of a Dou Zun class expert. As long as Xiao Yan repaired his soul, a Dou Zun class ultimate fighter would appear beside Xiao Yan in the future. A Dou Zun class fighter. Just what kind of powerful strength this was. Although it would only last for a year, that time would be sufficient for Xiao Yan. He ultimately possessed an extremely powerful aid that would be a great help in the future&#x2026;</p><p>Xiao Yan lowered his head and glanced at the snow-white Storage Ring on his finger. It was made of snow-white jade and it felt extremely exquisite. One would feel a smooth-feeling on contact. There was also a sleek-feeling to it. The ancients had said that a gentleman was like jade. What they meant was this kind of feeling that caused one to feel relaxed. The corner of Xiao Yan&#x2019;s mouth parted involuntarily. This scene had caused him to suddenly recall the scene of his first meeting with Yao Lao at Wu Tang City back then. His heart felt a faint warmth as he recalled it at this moment.</p><p>Xiao Yan&#x2019;s finger gently rubbed the flame seal on his forehead. His fist was involuntarily tightened. A low mutter to himself sounded within his heart, &#x201C;Hall of Souls. Just you wait. I will come and find you! At that time, we will settle all of our scores!&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;I am finally able to see the world outside of the magma again. How I yearn for it&#x2026;&#x201D; An illusionary white robe figure Tian Huo zun-zhe drifted out of the Storage Ring. He looked at the surrounding mountain wall and sighed.</p><p>Xiao Yan smiled. His hand faced the mountain wall as a black figure shot over explosively. Finally, the black figure turned into the Heavy Xuan Ruler and landed in his hand.</p><p>&#x201C;Xiao Yan, my soul is currently extremely weak and cannot appear for too long. I shall leave the matter of repairing my spirit to you. You must definitely remember that my spirit can endure for only a short period of time. Hence, you must make full use of the time&#x2026;&#x201D; Tian Huo zun-zhe sighed emotionally. He spoke solemnly as his gaze turned to Xiao Yan.</p><p>Xiao Yan smiled and nodded. He said, &#x201C;Old sir, please rest assured that Xiao Yan is not the kind of person who will do nothing after receiving gifts.&#x201D;</p><p>Not long later, Xiao Yan would begin his journey to the Central Plains. If Xiao Yan wanted to survive in that place where the strong gathered, he would need strength, regardless if it originated from him or his surroundings. If he could quickly repair Tian Huo zun-zhe&#x2019;s soul, Xiao Yan would have an additional helper beside him. This only benefited Xiao Yan without harming him. Therefore, he would naturally not cut edges with regards to this matter.</p><p>Tian Huo zun-zhe nodded with satisfaction. He slowly said, &#x201C;You can feel free to ask me if you have any questions when you practice the &#x2018;Five Ring Flame Expelling Technique.&#x2019; Since you have helped the old me, the old me will naturally not be stingy to you.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;In that case, this little fellow will give you my thanks.&#x201D; Xiao Yan involuntarily smiled when he heard this and thanked Tian Huo zun-zhe.</p><p>Tian Huo zun-zhe waved his hand. Perhaps it was because he had used the spatial strength earlier but his spirit had currently become much more illusionary. He could only let out a bitter smile upon seeing this. After which, he sighed, and his body moved, transforming into a light figure that entered his snow-white ring..</p><p>Xiao Yan spread his hands after seeing Tian Huo zun-zhe enter the ring once again.He raised his head and looked at the deep hole that reached the bottom of the Blazing Sky Qi Refining Tower. His body, however, did not move. He was hesitating. Currently, he was getting closer to the six star Dou Huang class. According to his estimation, the strange effect of those &#x2018;fire bead&#x2019; would at the very most allow him to enter the six star Dou Huang level in a month.</p><p>This magma world might be filled with danger. However, this was indeed a training treasure ground to Xiao Yan. The time in which he would leave for the Central Plains was becoming increasingly shorter. He had to make full use of his time to increase his abilities. This was because he knew that with his current strength, he was nothing in the Central Plains, where dragons and tigers lay. It would not be a simple matter if he wanted to obtain the top ten in the Pill Gathering where various alchemist from all over the continent gathered. All of this required him to put in a ton of effort&#x2026;</p><p>Xiao Yan made up his mind within his heart. He did not hesitate as his body rushed to the mountain cave on the wall. This cave was in front of an enormous cliff. The tree branches covered and hid the mountain cliff. Even if one was to walk close to it, one would not be able to easily discover it. Xiao Yan had placed a simple trap on the entrance of the cave that would enable him to quickly sense anyone who entered it. During his exploration journey, he had obtained a hundred of those &#x2018;fire beads,&#x2019; enough to use during this period of training. They would likely be sufficient support him to reach the six star Dou Huang level. Therefore, he needed to ensure that no one would interrupt him.</p><p>Xiao Yan&#x2019;s body entered the cave before he swiftly sat cross-legged. His face was solemn. This time around, he needed to use the fastest speed to breakthrough to become a six star Dou Huang!</p>
