<p><strong><u>Chapter 617: Turning the Tables, Capturing the Fallen Heart Flame</u></strong></p><p>The &#x2018;Fallen Heart Flame&#x2019; immediately appeared to have been angered as it emitted a sharp ear-piercing hiss after it seemed to have sensed the killing intent that slowly seeped out from Xiao Yan&#x2019;s body. That drifting faint green glow had become much denser.</p><p>Xiao Yan stretched his body lazily and raised his head toward the green glow. He laughed, &#x201C;What? Aren&#x2019;t you satisfied after burning me for so long?&#x201D;</p><p>The faint green glow became increasingly intense. When the furious hissing appeared once again, a circular light that appeared to be made of jade suddenly surfaced on the surface of the &#x2018;Fallen Heart Flame&#x2019;. The jade light flowed slowly, seemingly in possession of a spirit. Not long after the jade light appeared, clusters of invisible flame suddenly surged out from the walls of fire around him before finally wrapping around Xiao Yan from all directions.</p><p>Moreover, the &#x2018;Fallen Heart Flame&#x2019; had once again summoned fierce and intense heart flames within Xiao Yan&#x2019;s body aside from the vigorous exterior attack. From the looks of the situation, it clearly wanted to completely finish off this stubborn Xiao Yan through attacks from both within and outside.</p><p>&#x201C;These tactics again&#x2026;&#x201D;</p><p>Xiao Yan smiled and shook his head as he watched the invisible flame that came swarming over. With a flick of his finger, a green-colored flame that was many times more powerful than before suddenly surged out from his body, and blocked all the invisible flames, keeping them away. Xiao Yan was about to direct Dou Qi to wrap around the heart flame within his body, which possessed the greatest destructive strength, when he was stunned to discover that a strange fluorescence had suddenly erupted from his body the moment the heart flame spread. Upon being lit up by the fluorescence, the heart flame, which contained a frighteningly high temperature, appeared to have met its nemesis as it shrunk swiftly back. Within a short few blinks of an eye, it shrank until it completely disappeared under this fluorescent light&#x2026;</p><p>&#x201C;This is?&#x201D; Xiao Yan cried out in surprise and bewilderment. He looked at that strange fluorescent light within his body and felt somewhat at a loss. Where had this thing come from? Even the &#x2018;&#x2019;Fallen Heart Flame&#x2019; was afraid of it?</p><p>After that long deep slumber, Xiao Yan was naturally unaware of all the things that had happened within his body. That strange liquid that was mixed from the green lotus, the countless number of medicinal ingredients and medicinal pills, not only managed to heal and strengthen Xiao Yan&#x2019;s terribly damaged body during the fight with the heart flame, but its resistance toward the heart flame had also become increasingly greater with the flow of time. In the end, the back and forth fight within the body had basically became a one-sided victory. With the gradual ineffectiveness of the heart flame, that strange medicinal liquid had slowly penetrated every corner of Xiao Yan&#x2019;s body. The fluorescent light was something that it emitted when it met with an old foe.</p><p>The resistance this fluorescent light possessed against the heart flame of the &#x2018;Fallen Heart Flame&#x2019; was something that was obtained during the long, gradual grilling. One could bluntly say that as long as Xiao Yan&#x2019;s body possessed the protection of this fluorescent light, the burning effect of the heart flame from the &#x2018;Fallen Heart Flame&#x2019; would be greatly reduced.</p><p>This was Xiao Yan&#x2019;s greatest support when engaging in a counterattack with the &#x2018;Fallen Heart Flame&#x2019;!</p><p>The flame around Xiao Yan&#x2019;s body burned intensely, unleashing a frightening temperature. The naked, young man within revealed a warm smile. It was difficult to imagine that he had once suffered a fate worse than death while being grilled by this kind of flame before he had awakened&#x2026;</p><p>Xiao Yan finally released the heavy weight within his heart as he sensed the heart flame becoming gradually weaker after being exposed to this strange fluorescent light. Although he was uncertain about what kind of strange things had happened while he was in his deep slumber, he understood one thing &#x2014; the &#x2018;Fallen Heart Flame&#x2019; was something that was no longer frightening to him&#x2026;</p><p>&#x201C;The river flows thirty years east and thirty years west. Next, let us change position&#x2026;&#x201D; Xiao Yan raised his head and parted his mouth to smile toward the faint light glow. Awe seeped out from those white teeth.</p><p>&#x201C;Hiss!&#x201D;</p><p>The sharp hissing sound carried a fury as it sounded. Those two faint green lights suddenly soared, and a large cluster of invisible-whitish flames suddenly surfaced. Following the appearance of this cluster of flame, the bright red magma outside suddenly began to boil. Countless numbers of effervescence churned unceasingly before they quickly exploded apart, emitting a faint wave of fire poison and heat.</p><p>&#x201C;Stubborn fellow&#x2026;&#x201D;</p><p>Xiao Yan laughed coldly when he saw this intense retaliation by the &#x2018;Fallen Heart Flame&#x2019;. With the movement of a hand seal, the green-colored flame which was lingering around his body suddenly shrank swiftly into it. With the retreat of the green fire, the invisible flame which was surrounding it on the outside came pouncing over like ravenous wolves. Just as they were about to make contact with Xiao Yan&#x2019;s body, a wave of strange fluorescent light was slowly emitted from Xiao Yan&#x2019;s body.</p><p>The moment the invisible flame came into contact with the fluorescent light, it acted like a mouse which had just seen a cat or like snow meeting boiling oil. It swiftly fled back. Even the whitish flame which the &#x2018;Fallen Heart Flame&#x2019; had just summoned, also had ripples forming on the surface. Clearly, that wave of fluorescent light was something that they were extremely afraid of.</p><p>The strange fluorescent light had relied on its own special compatibility in its long fight with the &#x2018;Fallen Heart Flame&#x2019; before gradually transforming into a true nemesis of the latter.</p><p>Xiao Yan&#x2019;s eyes blinked gently as he watched the invisible flame swiftly withdraw. Those dark-black eyes actually had a wisp of strange fluorescent light.</p><p>The world that appeared in front of him immediately changed drastically as his eyes were filled with the fluorescent light&#x2026;</p><p>Although the world was still bright red, the &#x2018;Fallen Heart Flame&#x2019; around him had slowly turned transparent. Through this transparent body, a cluster of somewhat whitish palm-sized flame snakes flashed about repeatedly. The eyes of the small snake were filled with an invisible flame. As its pupils rotated, it gave itself an extremely smart appearance. Clearly, this small snake possessed some intelligence.</p><p>The small snake also appeared to have discovered Xiao Yan while the latter was watching it. A fierce glow immediately rose in the snake&#x2019;s eyes. Waves of frighteningly invisible flame slowly rose from its body.</p><p>&#x201C;Is this where the essence of the &#x2018;Fallen Heart Flame&#x2019; is located&#x2026;&#x201D;</p><p>Xiao Yan&#x2019;s eyes blinked slowly as he let out a soft laugh. Although the large cluster of flame around him appeared to be the &#x2018;Fallen Heart Flame&#x2019;, he must find the core position if he wanted to break through. That little fire snake was where this core was located.</p><p>As long as Xiao Yan captured it, he will have truly captured the &#x2018;Fallen Heart Flame&#x2019;!</p><p>Xiao Yan slowly extended his long hand. He lifted the corner of his mouth. An intense green flame wrapped firmly around it. The dense fluorescent light appeared after the wrapping of the flame, covering the green fire with another layer.</p><p>Xiao Yan&#x2019;s hand was in the shape of a claw as it curled slightly. He smiled toward the spot where the little fire snake was hidden.</p><p>Seeing Xiao Yan&#x2019;s smile, the little fire snake, that could not be seen with the naked eye, felt an ominous feeling. It swung its tail, and its tiny body shuttled in all directions in a lightning-like manner, attempting to use this to hide from Xiao Yan&#x2019;s gaze.</p><p>Regardless of how it shuttled around, it was ultimately within the region of the surrounding flame. It could only control the surrounding flame to leave with it if it truly wanted to flee. If that was the case, however, the intention of swallowing and refining the &#x2018;Heavenly Flame&#x2019; within Xiao Yan&#x2019;s body would go down the drain. This was something impossible for it to do.</p><p>Although the &#x2018;Fallen Heart Flame&#x2019; possessed an intelligence, it would still need a long evolution in order to achieve the kind of open-minded thinking that a human had.</p><p>&#x201C;You want to escape?&#x201D;</p><p>Every single action of the small fire snake was clearly visible through the eyes that were filled with a fluorescent light. Xiao Yan smiled, and shook his head. His body remained quiet while a faint silver-colored glow carrying the weak rolling sound of thunder appeared under his feet.</p><p>&#x201C;Chi!&#x201D;</p><p>Xiao Yan&#x2019;s body was quiet for a moment before it suddenly trembled. A substance-like afterimage remained on the spot while his figure appeared in front of the flame wall in a ghost-like manner. His fist that was wrapped by the green flame and the fluorescent light was violently extended, and it drilled into the wall. Immediately he clenched his fist, swiftly flashed and withdrew!</p><p>&#x201C;Hiss!&#x201D;</p><p>Xiao Yan&#x2019;s body was as fast as a ghost. In merely the blink of an eye, it had already rushed back to his original spot and completely merged with the afterimage that had yet to completely disappear. However, this time around, there was a small fire snake which was wildly struggling within his right hand that was wrapped by the fluorescent light. Sharp hissing sounds resounded repeatedly.</p><p>The surrounding fire wall had also become much more illusory after the small fire snake had been captured. However, it did not break apart because of this.</p><p>Xiao Yan&#x2019;s eyes carried a wild heat as he stared intently at the small, cream-white fire snake in his hand. A mad joyful expression involuntarily formed on his face. It was really unexpected that not only had he not lost his life in a situation where death was imminent, but he had also accidently advanced to become a Dou Wang. Now, he had even managed to easily capture the &#x2018;Fallen Heart Flame&#x2019;!</p><p>It is said that one sought wealth in a dangerous situation. These words were indeed true!</p><p>Although Xiao Yan&#x2019;s hand was isolated by both the green flame and the fluorescent light, the temperature that was emitted from the body of the &#x2018;Fallen Heart Flame&#x2019; still caused Xiao Yan&#x2019;s hand to feel a slight searing pain. This caused Xiao Yan to rejoice somewhat. If he lacked either of the strange fluorescent light and the &#x2018;Fallen Heart Flame&#x2019;, it was likely that he would be helpless against this &#x2018;Fallen Heart Flame&#x2019;. After all, a flame that had accumulated from an unknown number of years was really too frightening.</p><p>However, Xiao Yan had successfully captured it. Next, were the most important steps, refinement and swallowing&#x2026;</p><p>Xiao Yan&#x2019;s gaze stared intently at the wildly struggling little fire snake within the fluorescent light. Awe gradually surfaced in his eyes. He lowered his head to look at the dark-black ring on his finger as he muttered softly, &#x201C;Teacher&#x2026; protect this student to successfully refine it&#x2026; success and failure will be determined by this!&#x201D;</p><p>Xiao Yan must settle this &#x2018;Fallen Heart Flame&#x2019; if he wanted to escape from this vast magma!</p><p>Xiao Yan did not hesitate after his voice sounded. His body sat down, and he crossed his legs while being suspended. The green-colored flame in his hand suddenly soared. Under the wild and violent incineration by the green flame, the small fire snake slowly sank. Finally, it followed Xiao Yan&#x2019;s hand and swarmed into his body.</p><p>Xiao Yan&#x2019;s body instantly stiffened after the entry of the &#x2018;Fallen Heart Flame&#x2019;!</p><p>The true great battle was finally about to begin. If Xiao Yan was able to refine and swallow this second &#x2018;Heavenly Flame&#x2019;, it was likely that his strength would once again soar. That mysterious &#x2018;Flame Mantra&#x2019; would truly enter a matured stage!</p><p>The benefits that Xiao Yan would gain from enduring this would be incomparable!</p><p>If Xiao Yan failed to endure it, he might well be completely turned to dust from the remnant waves emitted from the collision of the two kinds of &#x2018;Heavenly Flame&#x2019;. At that time, regardless of whether another miracle would appear, it was likely that he would not saved!</p>
