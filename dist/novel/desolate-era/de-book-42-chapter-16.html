<p>In the end, Ji Ning elected to begin silently training in the Spacetime Sword Dao atop that mountain peak within the Sacred Mountains.</p><p>&#x201C;He&#x2019;s training AGAIN?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;This Daolord Darknorth is&#x2026;!&#x201D;</p><p>Bowenya and the others were so angry, their teeth hurt.&#xA0;Unfortunately, they wouldn&#x2019;t dare to actually charge out and attack.</p><p>Ning had long ago mastered his Space Sword Dao and had reached Hegemony in both the Dao of Space and the Dao of Time.</p><p>&#x201C;The Spacetime Sword Dao&#x2026;&#x201D;&#xA0;Ning silently visualized how it could be manifested.&#xA0;Twenty-six chaos cycles went past without him even realizing it.</p><p>Finally, Ning opened his eyes and shook his head slightly.&#xA0;He had made significant improvements at first, but now he had reached a major bottleneck and was stuck.&#xA0;He was far from being able to succeed in this Dao, which would most likely take tens of thousands of chaos cycles.&#xA0;He couldn&#x2019;t waste all of his time here.&#xA0;The &#x2018;Truesoul Everlasting&#x2019; technique was even more important.</p><p>&#x201C;My true body only has six hundred chaos cycles of life left.&#xA0;I have no chance of mastering the Spacetime Sword Dao.&#x201D;&#xA0;Ning rose to his feet, his eyes flashing sharply.&#xA0;&#x201C;Then I suppose I&#x2019;ll just have to take the risk and try to find a chance for myself.&#x201D;</p><p>Ning turned to stare at the distant, towering Elder Hall.&#xA0;&#x201C;Twenty-six chaos cycles have gone past, but Exalt Bowenya refuses to come out.&#xA0;He&#x2019;s quite steadfast.&#x201D;&#xA0;If the Exalt came out, he would almost certainly be defeated.&#xA0;Bowenya cared immensely about his own life; why would he come out?</p><p>&#x201C;He&#x2019;s coming!&#xA0;He&#x2019;s coming!&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;He&#x2019;s headed our way.&#x201D;&#xA0;Bowenya and the others had been forced to watch as Ning had trained for multiple chaos cycles.&#xA0;Now, Ning was coming for them once more, but this time they didn&#x2019;t feel too worried.</p><p>&#x201C;Let&#x2019;s see what this Daolord is planning to do,&#x201D; Bowenya said calmly.</p><p>Swoosh.&#xA0;Ning reached the Elder Hall, then rested his hand against its outer surface.&#xA0;Moments later, he silently blinked past its outer shell and entered it.</p><p>&#x201C;He came inside!!!&#x201D;&#xA0;Exalt Bowenya&#x2019;s eyes bulged out in shock.&#xA0;Moments later, they became filled with wild joy as he ordered, &#x201C;All Hegemons and Emperors, prepare to follow my previous instructions!&#xA0;Stand guard over your stations and attack Daolord Darknorth.&#xA0;Worsen his injuries and make sure he dies within my Daoguard Tower!&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Yes, Exalt!&#x201D;&#xA0;The response came from throughout the Daoguard Tower.</p><p>&#x201C;Ahahaha&#x2026; Daolord Darknorth, you actually dared to come inside, eh?&#xA0;Even your Autarchs would probably be trapped for an extremely long period of time if they dared to enter my Daoguard Tower.&#xA0;You?&#xA0;A Daolord who failed the Daomerge?&#xA0;Haha&#x2026; you&#x2019;ll definitely die!&#x201D;&#xA0;Bowenya was filled with confidence.&#xA0;He immediately turned and strode into the air, then vanished without a trace.</p><p>Within the very center of the Daoguard Tower was a dark and secluded region.&#xA0;This region was filled with an enormous millstone-like formation-base which was slowly swiveling at all times.&#xA0;It emanated ripples of spacetime, and Bowenya was standing atop it.&#xA0;This was the center of the Daoguard Tower, and the main control mechanism for this entire hidden dimension.</p><p>&#x201C;This time&#x2026; I, Bowenya, shall have accomplished something incredible for the Sithe!&#xA0;I&#x2019;ll be able to truly transcend my service and gain freedom.&#xA0;Daolord Darknorth, you are going to die!&#x201D;&#xA0;Bowenya stared towards countless globe-shaped illusions that were in front of him.&#xA0;One of the many globes was displaying a white-robed youth who bore a black sheath on his back &#x2013; Ji Ning.</p><p>The many globe-shaped illusions represented the true shape of this Daoguard Tower.&#xA0;It was a spacetime maze!</p><p>&#x2026;&#x2026;</p><p>After blinking into the Daoguard Tower, Ning saw a brand new world appear before him.&#xA0;He was within a dark-red cave that was merely a million kilometers in size.&#xA0;This region was covered with countless flowing runes that brimmed with fiery energy.&#xA0;There was nothing within this region save for Ning himself.</p><p>&#x201C;Up, down, left, right, forwards, backwards&#x2026;&#x201D;&#xA0;Ning stood there in midair, scanning his surroundings.&#xA0;He could vaguely sense that this region was connected to six other spacetime continuums.</p><p>&#x201C;It doesn&#x2019;t seem to matter which direction I choose.&#x201D;&#xA0;At Ning&#x2019;s level, his premonitions were extremely accurate.&#xA0;In truth, these &#x2018;senses&#x2019; were a reflection of the whispers of the Chaosverse itself.&#xA0;Ning truly was blessed and doted upon by the prime essences of the Chaosverse, and so his senses were extremely keen.&#xA0;Even here in a spacetime maze, his senses would help tell him which was the best path to take.</p><p>Rumble&#x2026; suddenly, all of the mystic runes within this region of one million kilometers began to flare up, producing dark-red flames that swarmed the region as they flew towards Ning. Ning was surrounded by his Sword Dao Domain, but the flames were omnipresent.&#xA0;</p><p>&#x201C;What powerful flames.&#x201D; Ning drew a Northbow sword. Sword-light spun out as he poured his divine power into his sword, using the Earth Sword Dao. It formed a triple layer of rippling yellow energy which surrounded him and protected him. The flames blazed away against him, but the earthen yellow energy simply rippled slightly while managing to endure.</p><p>Of Ning&#x2019;s many Daos, the Earth Sword Dao was the best suited for dealing with these corrosive dark-red flames.&#xA0;However, its power would quickly be used up at an alarming rate.&#xA0;Most likely, it would be consumed within ten seconds.</p><p>&#x201C;These flames are incredibly powerful.&#xA0;I imagine even the Blazesun Ruler would be roasted to death by them.&#x201D;&#xA0;Ning quickly began to inspect this spacetime continuum in detail.&#xA0;However, it took him three strikes with his sword to defend against the flames before he was able to locate the critical points to this spacetime continuum.</p><p>Boom!&#xA0;Boom!&#xA0;Ning began to furiously attack using his Space Sword Dao.&#xA0;His first sword scissored through space like paper, doing the groundwork necessary to allow his second sword to tear through this spacetime continuum.</p><p>Whoosh!&#xA0;A giant gaping hole in spacetime appeared.&#xA0;Ning immediately darted into it, then stared at the void before him.</p><p>Ning raised his head to glance at the &#x2018;skies&#x2019;.&#xA0;These spacetime continuums all seemed to be globe-shaped, and the spacetime globes were all linked together.&#xA0;There were dimensional seams between them as well, and Ning was within one of those seams.&#xA0;As he flew through the seams, he carefully inspected the area around him, but in the end was only able to discover a total of four spacetime continuums.&#xA0;Everything else was completely blocked off by these four.</p><p>&#x201C;So if I wish to advance, I have to enter one of these four?&#x201D;&#xA0;Ning hesitated.&#xA0;Suddenly&#x2026; crack!&#xA0;A bolt of lightning shot out from one of the nearby spacetime continuums, striking towards Ning and forcing him to use his Lightning Sword Dao to defend.</p><p>&#x201C;Daolord Darknorth, even if you don&#x2019;t enter my maze you&#x2019;ll still die,&#x201D; a cold voice rang out.</p><p>Ning quickly understood that Hegemons were using treasures within the Daoguard Tower to assault him!&#xA0;If he entered one of the continuums, he would have to face the dangers inherent to each continuum.&#xA0;If he remained outside, he would be ambushed and assaulted by the Hegemons and Emperors.</p><p>Ning glanced at the spacetime around him.&#xA0;&#x201C;What a formidable formation.&#x201D;&#xA0;Swoosh!&#xA0;Ning drilled into one of the spacetime continuums, flying inside.&#xA0;The spacetime membrane didn&#x2019;t block his path, allowing him to enter with ease.</p><p>This particular continuum was one filled with a boundless howling wind which felt as sharp as daggers.&#xA0;The wind cut everything within the continuum to ribbons, and Ning was forced to use his Water Sword Dao to defend.</p><p>&#x2026;&#x2026;</p><p>Danger was everywhere.&#xA0;Death was omnipresent.&#xA0;Ning&#x2019;s only choice was to defend while searching for ways to defeat the mechanisms inherent to each continuum!&#xA0;It must be remembered that within this spacetime maze, every single spacetime continuum contained a powerful offensive formation.&#xA0;As a result, they weren&#x2019;t exceptionally stable.&#xA0;These Daoguard Towers weren&#x2019;t built to trap foes; if trapping the foe was the goal, the Sacred Realm and Purgatory was more than enough.&#xA0;They existed to actively kill enemies!</p><p>Alas, they were invaders into this Chaosverse.&#xA0;As a result, Sithe Daoguard Towers were only able to draw upon the energy provided by the local generator they had set up.&#xA0;There was a limit to how much power they could draw.&#xA0;Back in their own homeland, they could draw upon the power of the entire Chaosverse.&#xA0;Only then would they be at peak power!&#xA0;Every single spacetime continuum would become dramatically more powerful.&#xA0;Even Autarchs would be attritioned to death.</p><p>As for now?&#xA0;It would be hard for this Daoguard Tower to slay an Autarch, but it could certainly trap one for an extended period of time.&#xA0;As for killing a Daolord whose lifespan was limited&#x2026; Bowenya felt certain that it would be quite easy.</p><p>&#x201C;This one here.&#x201D;&#xA0;Ning broke out of another spacetime continuum, following his premonitions and advancing without hesitation towards a brand-new continuum.</p><p>His senses wouldn&#x2019;t deceive him.&#xA0;This was definitely the path which led him closest to where he needed to go.&#xA0;If he followed this path, he would definitely be able to reach the core of this Daoguard Tower!</p><p>&#x201C;Hahaha!&#xA0;Daolord Darknorth, if my count is correct, you&#x2019;ve already attacked more than fifty times.&#x201D;&#xA0;Exalt Bowenya&#x2019;s voice echoed within this mist-filled continuum.&#xA0;&#x201C;As expected of the first master of an Eternal Omega Dao in this Chaosverse.&#xA0;You truly are impressive, and your senses truly are sharp!&#xA0;Even in a spacetime maze, you are able to find the best path available.&#x201D;</p><p>Ning completely ignored him, choosing to instead focus on analyzing the new region he was in.&#xA0;He wanted to find the center of this tower, then assault it with all his power.&#xA0;His strikes against it would be far more effective than his strikes anywhere else; two or three strikes would be enough to grant him escape.</p><p>&#x201C;But even if you can find the best path, it&#x2019;ll be of no use. You&#x2019;ll die of exhaustion before you ever reach it.&#x201D; Exalt Bowenya roared with laughter. &#x201C;Let me tell you a little secret. You are still at the outer edges of the spacetime maze. You aren&#x2019;t even close to me yet!&#x201D;</p>
