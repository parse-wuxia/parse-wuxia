<p>&#x201C;If you die here as a result, I guarantee that after reincarnating, you will be reborn into our Youngflame clan once more, and I will take you on as my disciple.&#x201D; Patriarch Arcanum looked at Youngflame Zhan. &#x201C;Zhan, child, this is a rare chance. You have to seize it!&#x201D;</p><p>Zhan could sense Patriarch Arcanum&#x2019;s ardent desire. He understood how important this was.</p><p>&#x201C;If you succeed&#x2026;then you might become an expert on the level of his Imperial Majesty, the Emperor,&#x201D; Patriarch Arcanum said eagerly.</p><p>Zhan nodded heavily.</p><p>&#x2026;&#x2026;</p><p>&#x201C;You have reincarnated nine times for the sake of overcome the Celestial Tribulation and becoming a Celestial Immortal. To become a Celestial Immortal is far, far too difficult&#x2026;the path in front of you is almost guaranteed to be a dead end. Little girl, if you become Daofather Crimsonbright&#x2019;s disciple, you need not fear that you will not be able to become a Celestial Immortal!&#x201D;</p><p>&#x2026;&#x2026;</p><p>&#x201C;Jiu, child, you absolutely have the power to make your way into the top three of this Conclave. Although our Cangwu clan has already reached the very pinnacle of power in the Grand Xia Empire, that&#x2019;s our limit; there&#x2019;s no way the imperial clan of the Grand Xia will give us any chance to increase in power any further, unless our Cangwu clan also produces a Pure Yang True Immortal. That, however, is too difficult&#x2026;but you now have that chance! You have to seize this sort of a chance!&#x201D;</p><p>&#x2026;&#x2026;</p><p>The various major clans, sects, and schools were all saying these words to the competitors with them.</p><p>If previously the Celestial Immortals were quite relaxed, upon learning that Daofather Crimsonbright was going to take on a disciple, all of them were frantic. They even felt hatred&#x2026;self-hatred for not having personally taught these young geniuses! If they had personally taught them, then the young geniuses on their side would probably be even more powerful.</p><p>Unfortunately, they had previously held these so-called geniuses in no regard at all; after all, there were far too many geniuses in the world. It was too late for any regrets.</p><p>Ji Ning and Yu Wei were next to each other. They were even holding hands, and the dreamy looks they were giving each other were causing even the nearby Yuchi Xiyue and Sloppy Daoist to get a bit sick of it.</p><p>&#x201C;Junior apprentice-brother, junior apprentice-sister, the two of you&#x2026;?&#x201D; The Sloppy Daoist blinked a few times.</p><p>&#x201C;You just found out?&#x201D; Yuchi Xiyue smirked.</p><p>Ji Ning and Yu Wei looked at each other and smiled.</p><p>After sharing life and death experiences together during the past year, their hearts had long ago become linked.</p><p>&#x201C;Haha, congratulations and felicitations. The disciples of the Black-White College, in participating in this Conclave, have actually produced a pair of Dao-companions. This shall be the talk of the world,&#x201D; the Sloppy Daoist laughed.</p><p>&#x201C;Sloppy Daoist, Ji Ning, don&#x2019;t be too relaxed,&#x201D; Yuchi Xiyue quickly warned. &#x201C;Didn&#x2019;t you hear? The top three have a chance to become accepted by Daofather Crimsonbright as a disciple. This is a chance to ascend to the heavens at one go! Daofather Crimsonbright is one of the true hegemons of the Three Realms, someone who has mastered a Heavenly Dao.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Right! We have to fight for this chance,&#x201D; the Sloppy Daoist nodded.</p><p>Ning nodded as well. At the same time, he mentally asked, &#x201C;Senior, if I become apprenticed to Daofather Crimsonbright, will he recognize my [Starseizing Hand] and realize the relationship between myself and Daoist Threelives? Will this be trouble?&#x201D;</p><p>Suddenly, a voice rang out in his mind. &#x201C;Ji Ning, don&#x2019;t worry; Daofather Crimsonbright was born a True God of Primordial Chaos. Like Master, he was born from the primordial chaos itself. They even adventured and faced life and death together; the relationship between them is quite deep. Although he wasn&#x2019;t one of Master&#x2019;s most intimate of friends, they were still on extremely good terms. Even if he knows of the relationship between you and Master, he won&#x2019;t harm you. Someone like Daofather Crimsonbright would not lower himself by acting against you.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;A True God of Primordial Chaos&#x2026;and they adventured together?&#x201D; Ning was puzzled. &#x201C;Daoist Threelives was one of the major powers of the Three Realms, while Daofather Crimsonbright is one as well. Even they need to adventure together and risk their lives?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;I don&#x2019;t understand this very clearly either; all I know is that there truly are some extremely terrifying places in the Three Realms. Master and some other True Gods of Primordial Chaos have joined forces in the past to fight in those places. All of them are very close to each other, and some of them are in fact individuals who are willing to sacrifice their lives for Master, and vice versa.&#x201D; The giant yellow bear sent, &#x201C;Don&#x2019;t worry. The True Gods of Primordial Chaos are quite a unified group.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;In addition, it was Daofather Crimsonbright who developed the [Crimsonbright Diagram of the Nine Heavens] which you train in.&#x201D; The giant yellow bear sighed, then sent, &#x201C;After countless years have passed, Daofather Crimsonbright has mastered a Heavenly Dao and become a Daofather. If Master is still alive, he should have perhaps mastered a Heavenly Dao as well.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Daofather Crimsonbright is very good-natured, and all the other True Gods of Primordial Chaos praise him. If you can become his apprentice, you should be able to learn some information regarding Master from him.&#x201D; The giant yellow bear had always wanted to learn if Daoist Threelives was still alive or not.</p><p>&#x201C;Then I will force my way into the top three, or even become number one. I will do my best to make Daofather Crimsonbright choose me as his disciple,&#x201D; Ning sent.</p><p>&#x201C;Right.&#x201D; The giant yellow bear felt eager as well.</p><p>&#x2026;&#x2026;</p><p>King Yan suddenly turned to look at the Sloppy Daoist, then asked mentally, &#x201C;Little Sloppy, you also want to become the disciple of Daofather Crimsonbright?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;I naturally have to at least give it a good shot,&#x201D; the Sloppy Daoist said, puzzled. &#x201C;How can I let a chance like this just slip away? If I miss it, I probably won&#x2019;t have another chance like this for the rest of my life.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;How did you learn the Grand Black Tortoise divine ability?&#x201D; King Yan asked.</p><p>The sloppy, pudgy youth grinned. He knew that upon revealing it, his secrets would be eventually revealed. After all, the Grand Black Tortoise divine ability was simply too easy to recognize. He laughed then sent mentally, &#x201C;Your Highness, I acquired this Grand Black Tortoise divine ability by luck. While adventuring, I entered a cavern estate and thus inherited a legacy and was taught this grand divine ability.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Oh.&#x201D; King Yan now understood. Most likely, the Sloppy Daoist had no idea&#x2026;that his master was Grand Emperor Xuanwu!</p><p>In the main hall of the Skylight Palace, the various Celestial Immortals were all chatting and laughing amongst themselves while paying attention to the duels that were going on atop the cloud.</p><p>The first round of duels was currently taking place.</p><p>In the first battle, Cangwu Jiu battled against Dragonmatch. This was an exceptionally vicious battle, as both were Fiendgod Body Refiners. Dragonmatch was unwilling to admit defeat until almost all of his divine power had been used up. However, his eyes were clearly filled with resentment. As for the Celestial Immortal Patriarchs of the Myriad Beasts School, they couldn&#x2019;t help but shake their heads with resentment and sigh as they saw this. The chance had come and go, just like that.</p><p>In the second battle, Adept Woodpass battled against Kindwater Qi. Kindwater Qi immediately used a forbidden technique at the very start, going all out. However, Adept Woodpass actually showed mercy; at a critical moment in the fight, he merely gave Kindwater Qi a heavy wound, not taking his life. The helpless Kindwater Qi was forced to admit defeat.</p><p>One battle after another went on, everyone going all out.</p><p>&#x201C;The allure of becoming a Daofather&#x2019;s disciple&#x2026;who can resist it?&#x201D; Lu Dongbin shook his head and sighed. Raising his head, he took a swig of wine from his cup. &#x201C;And yet, how many of them understand&#x2026;that the disciple of a Daofather is still nothing more than a disciple. The master can bring you into the school, but training is a matter of personal cultivation. The major powers of the Three Realms&#x2026;they all relied on their own abilities for their achievements.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Lu Dongbin! You hypocrite, you have two Daofathers standing behind you and even more Daofathers who have provided you guidance, and you&#x2019;re going to sigh and shake your heads at them?&#x201D; The Immortal Elder of the Northlands was clearly rather displeased. &#x201C;This old man can&#x2019;t stand your words.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;You&#x2019;re just jealous.&#x201D; Lu Dongbin cast the Immortal Elder a sideways glance out of the corner of his eyes.</p><p>&#x201C;Jealous my ass. This old man is also a Pure Yang True Immortal; if you have true ability, then go become a Daofather! By then, I&#x2019;d definitely admire you; in fact, I&#x2019;d even go to your door and obediently listen to you expound on the Dao and treat you as I would a teacher,&#x201D; the Immortal Elder snorted.</p><p>&#x201C;Shameless old fogey. Once I truly do become a Daofather&#x2026;I might not even be willing to expound on the Dao with you. It&#x2019;ll depend on my mood.&#x201D; After saying these words, even Lu Dongbin himself felt that he was boasting too much; after all, it wasn&#x2019;t so easy for someone to become a Daofather. He didn&#x2019;t even have mastery over a Heavenly Dao yet! He immediately pointed towards the outside and said, &#x201C;Look, the disciple of Grand Emperor Xuanwu has entered the arena.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x2026;&#x2026;</p><p>In the sixth battle, the Sloppy Daoist fought against Adept Gloomcloud.</p><p>Adept Gloomcloud truly was an extraordinary figure; however, there was a quite a bit of difference in power between himself and the Sloppy Daoist. Fortunately, the Sloppy Daoist showed mercy and so Adept Gloomcloud&#x2019;s life was spared. He admitted defeat, then left.</p><p>&#x2026;&#x2026;</p><p>The Grand Xia Emperor, seated atop his imperial throne, stared downwards at his subjects. He said calmly, &#x201C;The 41th duel shall be between Ji Ning of the Black-White College and Zhuxiang of the Redlotus Sect.&#x201D;</p><p>His voice didn&#x2019;t just reverberate within the main hall; his echoing voice, filled with all of his majesty, reverberated within the imperial citadel plaza as well.</p><p>The delegates from the 3600 commanderies and four seas all stared into the skies. In the sky above them was a massive mirror, which reflected the scenes of battle between the geniuses within the grand sealing formation atop the cloud.</p><p>&#x201C;Junior apprentice-brother, you have to be careful.&#x201D; Within the palace, the Sloppy Daoist said with a laugh, &#x201C;This Zhuxiang is a Fiendgod Body Refiner. All Fiendgod Refiners are tough to deal with. Thankfully, the Adept Gloomcloud I ran into just now was a Ki Refiner, which made it a bit easier.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Ji Ning, be careful.&#x201D; Yu Wei looked at Ning as well.</p><p>&#x201C;Don&#x2019;t worry. I&#x2019;m planning to go for number one.&#x201D; Ning immediately turned and walked outside.</p><p>Right at this moment, a youth who had been seated in the lotus position behind a distant Celestial Immortal also rose to his feet and began to walk towards the outside. This youth seemed quite wanton and dissolute, and gave the impression of being perpetually sleepy. However, he was the number one Holy Child of an extremely large sect, the Redlotus Sect. His power was indeed formidable; previously, the outside world had known very little about him, and he had only become famous during this Conclave.</p><p>&#x201C;They are coming out. Coming out!&#x201D; Mu Northson stared upwards excitedly. &#x201C;Quick, look, senior apprentice-brother Ji Ning is coming out.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Brother Ji Ning&#x2019;s power is formidable; that Zhuxiang of the Redlotus Sect is no match for him at all. Brother Ji Ning is aiming to be number one.&#x201D; Northmont Baiwei was watching with excitement as well; he naturally was pleased upon seeing his good friend ascend farther and farther along this Immortal path.</p><p>&#x201C;Wonderful. My Black-White College is about to suddenly become famous, utterly famous!&#x201D; Immortal Fivecraze was in extremely high spirits and excited.</p><p>&#x201C;Master.&#x201D; Little Qing&#x2019;s serpentine eyes were flashing with light as well.</p><p>The Whitewater Hound&#x2019;s head was also lifted. As he watched, he felt his chest heave with emotions. &#x201C;Big brother, if you were still alive&#x2026;how wonderful it would be for you to be here and watch Ji Ning become such a dazzling figure in this Conclave of Immortal Destiny of the Grand Xia Dynasty.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x2026;&#x2026;</p><p>Atop the cloud. Within the grand sealing formation.</p><p>Ji Ning and Zhuxiang of the Redlotus Sect were both standing within the grand sealing formation. Zhuxiang was dressed extremely casually. His Daoist robes appeared quite sloppy, and a large portion of his chest was revealed as well. He looked at Ning, appearing to be still half-asleep.</p><p>Zhuxiang sighed gently, &#x201C;I didn&#x2019;t expect to run into you in the very first duel. I heard that you are one of the participants in this Conclave who is the hardest to deal with. In the Diagram, I travelled alongside my fellow disciples. No one was capable of forcing me to unleash my supreme technique&#x2026;but I didn&#x2019;t expect that I would be forced to do so in this very first battle. You should feel lucky to lose to my supreme technique.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Zhuxiang.&#x201D; Ning spoke out. &#x201C;Do you know&#x2026;what I view you as?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;What?&#x201D; Zhuxiang smiled lazily. &#x201C;A pile of crap? A mere ant? A mighty dragon? Or&#x2026;?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;No, no&#x2026;in my eyes&#x2026;you are an Immortal-ranked magic treasure,&#x201D; Ning chortled.</p><p><br></p><hr><p><br></p>
