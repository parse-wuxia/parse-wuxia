<p>&#x201C;An Otherverse Lord had escaped into his otherverse, yet had still been killed and his entire otherverse had been destroyed.&#x201D; Azurefiend sent a mental sigh: &#x201C;That is why everyone suspects that in addition to the two war machines the Lonely King has made public, he should also have a third Sithe war machine of incredible power. Thus, Darknorth&#x2026; I really do urge you to reconsider how you wish to treat the Icepeak Army. They aren&#x2019;t easy to deal with. I&#x2019;m a solitary wanderer who doesn&#x2019;t have that many treasures, and so the Icepeak Army won&#x2019;t expend too much resources on hunting me down&#x2026; but you, Darknorth, have a realmship. The Icepeak Army isn&#x2019;t going to just give up.&#x201D;</p><p>Azurefiend was quite a proud man, but he felt that Ji Ning had to consider what was best for his sect and his homeland.</p><p>&#x201C;Azurefiend, aside from the Lonely King, do the other three Golden Emperors of the Icepeak Army have especially powerful war machines?&#x201D; Ning asked.</p><p>&#x201C;They do not.&#x201D; Azurefiend&#x2019;s response was quite succinct. &#x201C;The Icepeak Army has caused quite a few wars, but I&#x2019;ve never heard of the three Golden Emperors employing any war machines of repute.&#x201D;</p><p>Ning let out a sigh secretly. Given how exalted the Lonely King was, he wouldn&#x2019;t go so far as to act against a Daolord for the sake of a mere realmship.</p><p>&#x201C;Oh, right. The Flamewing God vs the Lonely King&#x2026; which should be stronger?&#x201D; Ning asked mentally. He had his own thoughts, but Azurefiend had been alive for much longer and had seen many things.</p><p>&#x201C;Hard to say who is stronger. Flamewing is just a bit too dumb. It was born with tremendous vitality and has a virtually indestructible body, but Otherverse Lords should be able to stay alive against him,&#x201D; Azurefiend said. &#x201C;The Lonely King, however, is different; he&#x2019;s able to use war machines and is thus a greater threat.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;What if Flamewing fights the Lonely King?&#x201D; Ning asked mentally.</p><p>&#x201C;Flamewing won&#x2019;t be able to kill the Lonely King, but there&#x2019;s no way the Lonely King would be able to kill Flamewing. I&#x2019;ve been alive for an extremely long period of time, but I&#x2019;ve never heard of any major power who was capable of subduing a Chaos Primordial, save for the Autarchs themselves. Kill one? Impossible,&#x201D; Azurefiend sent mentally. &#x201C;Darknorth, as you know, the most powerful members of the Sithe race were their Exalts, and it took three of them in order to capture Flamewing&#x2026; and it remained completely unharmed. Amongst cultivators, everyone knows that only Autarchs are capable of killing Chaos Primordials!&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Good to know.&#x201D; Ning came to a decision. Based on the information he had, he also felt confident that no one save for an Autarch would be able to kill Flamewing. Perhaps the Sithe during their glory days were capable of capturing Chaos Primordials when they sent out their most powerful members, and perhaps they might even be able to kill Chaos Primordials via their unique technology&#x2026; but the Sithe were dust. Although the Lonely King was terrifyingly strong, he had merely gained access to a single war machine treasury the Sithe had left behind.</p><p>&#x201C;What do you plan to do?&#x201D; Azurefiend sent back.</p><p>&#x201C;Azurefiend, will you be frightened if I refuse them?&#x201D; Ning sent mentally.</p><p>Azurefiend glanced at Ning, rather surprised. &#x201C;I&#x2019;m a solitary Hegemon who wanders alone. What do I have to be afraid of? Have you really decided?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Yes. I&#x2019;m confident in my chances.&#x201D; Ning nodded.</p><p>&#x2026;&#x2026;</p><p>The three onyx humanoids simply stood there and waited as Ning and Hegemon Azurefiend spoke mentally to each other. They were in no rush. They could tell that Darknorth and Azurefiend were discussing this matter. They felt that once this weak Daolord learned the truth of the Icepeak Army&#x2019;s might, he would make the wise choice.</p><p>&#x201C;So do you know a bit more about the Icepeak Army now?&#x201D; the skinny onyx humanoid looked at Ning.</p><p>&#x201C;I&#x2019;m a Daolord who is unlearned compared to my Hegemonic peers. I&#x2019;ve only heard of you for the first time today. Impressive, truly impressive,&#x201D; Ning said.</p><p>&#x201C;Cut the crap.&#x201D; The cyclopean onyx humanoid was growing a bit impatient. Frowning, he barked out, &#x201C;Hurry up and hand over the realmship. Otherwise, we&#x2019;re going to attack. When that happens, both you and your sect shall both perish.&#x201D; He had long ago grown accustomed to acting as he pleased. He had originally been a fairly powerful Eternal Emperor, and after he underwent the Ritual Sacrificium to become a member of the Icepeak Army he had received deference from even Hegemons and Otherverse Lords, all of whom feared the Icepeak Army&#x2019;s reputation.</p><p>Originally, his greatest worry was that this Daolord would cause trouble due to the Daolord&#x2019;s ignorance of the Icepeak Army&#x2019;s might. That was why he had held back. But now? Now, he was naturally going to press hard.</p><p>Ning stood there, flanked by Azurefiend and Whitethaw. &#x201C;I don&#x2019;t wish to make an enemy out of the Icepeak Army, and I&#x2019;m not qualified to do that either. However, realmships are incredibly precious. You wish for me to simply hand it over for nothing? I might be a mere Daolord, but I have my pride.&#x201D; Ning smiled. &#x201C;I have a simple, mutually beneficial solution which will result in me handing over the realmship willingly.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;A mutually beneficial solution?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Speak.&#x201D; The three onyx humanoids were rather irritated. The Icepeak Army was so incredibly famous that even Hegemons were terrified of them. Only a few solitary Hegemons who wandered alone would dare act so arrogantly before them.</p><p>&#x201C;Simple. The Icepeak Army can buy the realmship from me,&#x201D; Ning said.</p><p>&#x201C;Buy?&#x201D; The three onyx humanoids exchanged a glance. &#x201C;Very well. This estate-world of mine has quite a few treasures inside. I&#x2019;ll give it to you in exchange for the realmship.&#x201D; The skinny onyx humanoid casually handed over a golden palm-sized disc which was actually an estate-treasure. The two onyx humanoids were quite calm as well; they felt certain that this Daolord simply wanted a way to save face. It didn&#x2019;t really matter if they tossed out a few treasures.</p><p>Ning shook his head. &#x201C;The value has to be on par with the realmship.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;On par?&#x201D; Finally, the looks on the faces of the three onyx humanoids changed. For the first time, they began to realize that this Daolord wasn&#x2019;t looking for a way to save face; he was going to be a tough nut to crack! Realmships were incredibly valuable; not even treasures like Crimsonwave Temple were even close in value to a realmship. Even if the three onyx humanoids pooled all of their treasures together, they still wouldn&#x2019;t be able to afford one. Most likely, their general Lord Wulf would have to trade all of his treasures to just barely afford a realmship.</p><p>Trade for something of equivalent value? This would be a fairly good deal if it was between two figures who were on par with each other, such as the Lonely King and Realmslord Windgrace. This was because generally speaking people were completely unwilling to sell realmships; to merely ask for treasures of equivalent value was already a good bargain.</p><p>However&#x2026; Realmslord Windgrace was in command of the Blacksun. He was on the same level as the Lonely King. How was it that a mere Daolord dared to demand treasures of equivalent value?</p><p>&#x201C;Are you looking to die?&#x201D; the skinny onyx humanoid&#x2019;s eyes flashed with cold light.</p><p>&#x201C;I&#x2019;ve already taken a step back and given face. If you accept, we&#x2019;ll carry out the trade. If you refuse? I can&#x2019;t just hand over my realmship for nothing.&#x201D; Ning&#x2019;s own aura began to sharpen as well.</p><p>&#x201C;You...!&#x201D; The three onyx humanoids stared at the Daolord before them, stunned. He actually was going to face them head-on?</p><p>&#x201C;He&#x2019;s courting death.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Kill him.&#x201D; The cyclopean onyx humanoid was the first to attack. He instantly transformed into a streak of light who shot towards Ning. He struck out with his right hand, sending it piercing towards Ning like a long spear, with his fingernails being the tip! Black Emperors all had incredibly powerful bodies; every single part of them was like a weapon.</p><p>The arm-spear pierced straight through the void, so powerful as to cause Ning&#x2019;s eyebrows to rise slightly. &#x201C;Hmph.&#x201D; Whitethaw, by Ning&#x2019;s side, let out an angry snort and immediately charged forwards. While charging, he transformed into an enormous white cloth that swept out towards his foe.</p><p>&#x201C;A mere golem seeks to block me?&#x201D; The cyclopean onyx humanoid felt some disdain. He was at the Hegemon level of power! Although his insights into the Dao were a bit inferior to true Hegemons, his Black Emperor body gave him tremendous power and allowed him to match Hegemons in battle. His body was so incredibly tough and resilient that in a real battle of life and death, he actually had an advantage.</p><p>Bang! This terrifying Hegemonic strike stabbed straight into the enormous white cloth, but the white cloth was incredibly resilient and dispersed all of the attacking energy.</p><p>&#x201C;What?!&#x201D; The cyclopean onyx humanoid was shocked. The golem had actually blocked his attack?</p><p>&#x201C;Kill them all.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Kill them and take the realmship.&#x201D; The two other onyx humanoids began to attack as well. Whoosh! Whoosh! Both moved with incredible speed. Although Whitethaw had blocked one of them, that was already his limit; there was no way he could block the other two.</p><p>&#x201C;Hahaha&#x2026;&#x201D; Azurefiend laughed loudly as he transformed into his bestial form. His entire body became covered with azure scales, and his head became triangular in shape. His scale-covered tail waved menacingly like a whip, and his entire body glimmered with dark light. He let out a furious howl as he charged through the air, moving to engage.</p><p>&#x201C;The Daolord actually isn&#x2019;t hiding in Hegemon Azurefiend&#x2019;s estate-world.&#x201D; The skinny onyx humanoid was delighted by this and sent mentally, &#x201C;I&#x2019;ll tie down Azurefiend. You go kill the Daolord.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Alright.&#x201D; The muscular onyx humanoid was delighted as well. Neither of them had imagined that the Daolord wouldn&#x2019;t go into hiding.</p><p><br></p><hr><p><br></p>
