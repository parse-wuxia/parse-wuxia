<p>By the time Ji Ning emerged from the different dimensional continuum, he had already emerged directly outside that chaos planet.</p><p>The five World-level cultivators of Clearwind Temple who were surrounding and attacking that lone figure on the surface of the chaos planet immediately noticed the intruder. Their leader, a muscular and tall World-level cultivator, immediately barked out, &#x201C;Clearwind Temple is in pursuit of a thief. Fellow Daoist, leave immediately!&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Hmph.&#x201D; Ning let out a cold snort, immediately transforming into a streak of sword-light. He moved at four times the speed of light as he charged over at maximum speed.</p><p>As soon as Ning began to move, the World-level cultivators on the chaos planet were all shocked. Four times the speed of light? It must be understood that most World-level cultivators weren&#x2019;t even able to move at twice the speed of light, unless they specialized in certain speed-based secret arts. Daolords of the First Step could generally move at double the speed of light, Daolords of the Second Step could move at triple the speed of light, Daolords of the Third Step could move at quadruple the speed of light, and Daolords of the Fourth Step could move at quintuple the speed of light.</p><p>Of course, this was just the &#x2018;normal&#x2019; speed. If you were skilled in evasive techniques or had a good evasion-type treasure, things would be completely different. Both, however, were extremely rare.</p><p>&#x201C;How can a World-level cultivator move that fast? He must specialize in a movement art.&#x201D; The five World-level cultivators of Clearwind Temple immediately came to this conclusion.</p><p>&#x201C;I am Darknorth of Vastheaven Palace!&#x201D; Ning&#x2019;s cold, baleful voice instantly rang out within the air above the chaos planet, and it struck against the hearts of those five World-level cultivators like thunder, causing their faces to turn pale.</p><p>Vastheaven Palace? Not good!</p><p>&#x201C;Is that brother Darknorth?&#x201D; The belabored and surrounded azure-robed figure immediately called out loudly, &#x201C;Careful, brother Darknorth! The five of them are not easy to deal with.&#x201D; He had heard of Darknorth before. Daolord Solesky&#x2019;s incarnation in Vastheaven Palace had told everyone of Darknorth, letting them know that they had gained a new brother whose name was Darknorth and who was just an Elder God.</p><p>&#x201C;According to what big brother Solesky said, Darknorth is just an Elder God. But that doesn&#x2019;t seem to be right,&#x201D; the azure-robed man mused to himself.</p><p>&#x2026;&#x2026;</p><p>&#x201C;Stop him!&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;He belongs to Vastheaven Palace? Capture him as well and imprison them both into Blackwind Prison!&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Attack!&#x201D;</p><p>The five cultivators of Clearwind Temple, upon realizing that Ning was from Vastheaven Palace, immediately launched their attacks against him as well. Two of them continued their assaults on the azure-robed figure while the other three began to charge towards Ning.</p><p>&#x201C;Hmph.&#x201D; Ning flew forwards like a streak of sword-light, not even drawing his black swords. He just gave them a cold look.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>It was as though the heavens themselves were collapsing! A terrifying, awesome sword-intent suddenly appeared on the surface of the chaos planet, crystallizing into streaks of sword-light. Countless streaks of sword-light descended upon the world as the five World-level cultivators stared upwards in terror. In the face of this boundless rain of sword-intent, the five were like nothing more than ants.</p><p>&#x201C;How can he be this strong?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Impossible.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;This sword-intent&#x2026;&#x201D; The five World-level cultivators were completely stunned. For the sword-intent alone to be this strong&#x2026; this man could wipe them out as easily as if they were ants. Utterly terrified, the five all produced white jade seals in their hands, then crushed them to beg for rescue. They didn&#x2019;t even think about fighting back; all they wanted to do was beg for aid.</p><p>Whoosh. The endless sword-intent crashed upon them like a wave, smothering and drowning all five of the World-level cultivators. The sword-intent was as soft as cotton, quickly wrapping around all five World-level cultivators. Ning then took out a gourd and opened it, allowing its opening to exert a tremendous sucking power. Swoosh! All five cultivators were instantly drawn inside.</p><p>With but a thought, Ning dismissed the sword-intent from the skies.</p><p>As far as Ning was concerned, these five World-level cultivators truly were like ants. The difference in power between him and them was simply enormous. Ning, however, didn&#x2019;t wish to be rash. He&#x2019;d first capture them, then decide later whether or not to kill them.</p><p>&#x201C;Brother Darknorth?&#x201D; The azure-robed man stared blankly at Ning. He was rather dazed right now.</p><p><em>Big brother Solesky, didn&#x2019;t you say that brother Darknorth was just an Elder God? For him to have reached the World level was one thing. How did he become this powerful?! He didn&#x2019;t even have to attack; his sword-intent alone was enough to capture all five of those World-level cultivators. Two of them were supreme World Gods!</em></p><p>&#x201C;My name is Eastherd.&#x201D; The azure-robed man suppressed his puzzlement as Ning walked towards him, then said, &#x201C;Brother Darknorth, thank you for saving my life.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Brother Eastherd, I just so happened to move past this area on my way to Vastheaven Palace.&#x201D; Ning smiled. &#x201C;What, you&#x2019;ve heard of me before?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;I have.&#x201D; The azure-robed man nodded immediately. &#x201C;Big brother Solesky told us about you long ago. He said that you are an Elder God who has close to a World God&#x2019;s level of power, and that you&#x2019;d be making a breakthrough quite soon. But now&#x2026; it seems that you have not only reached the World level, you are so powerful as to render me speechless.&#x201D;</p><p>Ning chuckled. Indeed. When he met Daolord Solesky, he was just an Elder God.</p><p>&#x201C;Has big brother Solesky returned from the Waveshift Realm yet?&#x201D; Ning immediately asked.</p><p>&#x201C;Not yet.&#x201D; Eastherd shook his head and sighed. &#x201C;He&#x2019;s still trapped in the Waveshift Realm, with his incarnation standing guard over Vastheaven Palace. His incarnation has mentioned you to us before. Ugh&#x2026; the Waveshift Realm is an estate-world left behind by an Eternal Emperor, and Eternal Emperor Waveshift was no ordinary Eternal Emperor at that!&#x201D;</p><p>Ning nodded.</p><p>The Waveshift Realm was one of the many danger zones of the Endless Territories. Quite a few Daolords of the Fourth Step had perished in that place, but a steady stream of them continued to enter it. This was because Emperor Waveshift had left behind certain incredible treasures within that place. Emperor Waveshift was no ordinary Emperor; he was incredibly skilled in the art of Numerancy, to the point of being acclaimed as the number one Numerancy diviner in all the Endless Territories.</p><p>Later, he had left to go out adventuring. His estate had become an ownerless item, with generations of Daolords venturing into it to seek out their fortunes. Daolord Badlands was also very skilled in Numerancy. He had even erected his own school within the Waveshift Everworld. There were many other major powers who felt certain that he must&#x2019;ve received one of Emperor Waveshift&#x2019;s legacies.</p><p>Swoosh. Swoosh.</p><p>Two figures flew in from afar. They were Pillsaint and Su Youji. Although they were both Daolords, they were slower than Ning in both teleporting as well as raw flying speed.</p><p>&#x201C;Two Daolords.&#x201D; Eastherd was badly shocked.</p><p>&#x201C;Master, what happened to those people from Clearwind Temple?&#x201D; Pillsaint asked.</p><p>&#x201C;Master, you move too fast.&#x201D; Su Youji laughed.</p><p>Ning nodded, then looked at Eastherd. &#x201C;Eastherd, let&#x2019;s leave immediately. This place is very close to Clearwind Temple&#x2019;s territory; it&#x2019;ll be dangerous for us to stay here too long.&#x201D;</p><p>Eastherd was stunned upon hearing these two Daolords address Ning as &#x2018;master&#x2019;. Upon hearing Ning&#x2019;s words, he immediately nodded. &#x201C;Right, right, right! Let&#x2019;s hurry up and leave.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Let&#x2019;s go.&#x201D;</p><p>Ning produced his flying vessel, and all four of them immediately boarded it. The vessel quickly disappeared into the skies.</p><p>&#x2026;..</p><p>Aboard the flying vessel.</p><p>Eastherd stared at Pillsaint and Su Youji, then looked at Ning.</p><p>&#x201C;Daolords?&#x201D; Eastherd looked at Ning. &#x201C;Brother Darknorth, these two Daolords are your retainers?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Is that really so surprising? My master can become a Daolord whenever he wishes. Even now, he&#x2019;s still much more powerful than the two of us,&#x201D; Pillsaint said.</p><p>&#x201C;You haven&#x2019;t seen our master&#x2019;s true power yet,&#x201D; Su Youji said.</p><p>Eastherd was secretly speechless. But it was true; he really had seen nothing at all. Just now, Ning had merely exerted a bit of his sword-intent in order to capture the five foes. That couldn&#x2019;t even be considered a real attack.</p><p>&#x201C;Brother Eastherd.&#x201D; Ning immediately asked, &#x201C;How did you end up in a fight against Clearwind Temple, and on their territory?&#x201D;</p><p>Clearwind Temple was located extremely close to the territory that battle had just taken place in. Vastheaven Palace, however, was still another eleven territories away. It&#x2019;d still take them another half year to reach it.</p><p>Half a year wasn&#x2019;t a long period of time, given how long most cultivators lived for, but it wasn&#x2019;t exactly short either. Half a year was enough for you to die countless times in a life-and-death battle.</p><p>These two mighty sects were twelve territories away from each other. They had their own territories and nursed old grudges against each other; they could be considered mortal enemies.</p><p>&#x201C;As for this matter, it has to do with one of my disciples.&#x201D; Eastherd shook his head. &#x201C;Twenty thousand years ago, when I was wandering the outside world, I encountered a young fellow who was incredibly talented and also very kind-hearted. I took him on as my disciple and watched him grow, providing some occasional guidance in secret. Who would&#x2019;ve thought that he would end up harvesting a treasure that would attract the attention and pursuit of Clearwind Temple? Of course I had to rescue him! But Clearwind Temple is very close to this place, and many World-level cultivators quickly came to aid their forces. That&#x2019;s why I ended up being surrounded and attacked by five of them at once. If it wasn&#x2019;t for you, brother Darknorth, I probably&#x2026;&#x201D;</p><p>Ning slowly nodded. &#x201C;When I captured those five from Clearwind Temple, they all shattered jade talismans. Most likely, they were sending out a distress call.&#x201D;</p><p><br></p><hr><p><br></p>
