<p>Ji Ning hovered there in midair, staring downwards at the Armaments Gorge. He then immediately flew downwards and landed in front of an icy building that was erected within the gorge. This was the true Armaments Gorge.</p><p>There were two golems guarding the gates to the building.</p><p>&#x201C;Darknorth greets you,&#x201D; Ning said courteously.</p><p>&#x201C;Swordfive.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Swordsix.&#x201D;</p><p>The two golems introduced themselves. They both had stately, solemn auras of tremendous power.</p><p>Ning walked past the gates, and the two golems let him enter unimpeded. Although there were many weapons and treasures stored here, not even Eternal Emperors were strong enough to seize them by force. The formations surrounding the most important parts of the Twelve Palaces had been personally established long ago by the almighty Hegemon himself, and the successive generations of geniuses in the Twelve Palaces had repeatedly strengthened them and reinforced them. By now, there were few to none in all the Endless Territories capable of breaking inside.</p><p>&#x201C;What a treasure trove.&#x201D; As soon as Ning entered, he saw the divine swords that had been firmly planted into the ground. They were clustered tightly next to each other, and they all emanated auras of terrifying sword-intent. Even the weakest sword was at least an Eternal weapon.</p><p>There was a stone stele next to every single sword, and each stone stele had a simple line of characters on them: &#x201C;Thirty thousand cubes.&#x201D; &#x201C;Ninety thousand cubes.&#x201D; &#x201C;Fifty thousand cubes.&#x201D; These were the prices of the swords, and the prices were actually quite low. Still, it hadn&#x2019;t been easy for the Sword Palaces to collect these wondrous weapons, and there was no way Ning and the others could simply take the swords away without paying anything at all.</p><p>&#x201C;What is&#x2026;&#x201D;</p><p>Ning&#x2019;s gaze suddenly turned towards the distance, where he sensed an incredibly terrifying sword-intent radiating from afar. Although it was quite a distance off, and although there were thousands of other swords there, Ning could sense that none of them were able to shake that terrifying sword-intent in the slightest. It was a broken sword that was emanating that aura, and it was placed atop a table.</p><p>This was the only sword in the entire Armaments Gorge which was placed on a table.</p><p>&#x201C;A broken sword?&#x201D; Puzzled, Ning walked towards it to give it a careful look.</p><p>&#x201C;Eh? It was broken in such a clean, natural way. It seems as though it was actually forged this way and meant to be this way.&#x201D; Ning quickly was able to tell that this sword wasn&#x2019;t actually &#x2018;broken&#x2019;; it was created this way.</p><p>Rumble&#x2026;</p><p>Sword-intent billowed out from the sword. Ning felt as though he was a tiny ship facing the wild waves of the ocean, about to be capsized at any moment. The incomparably ancient sword-intent&#x2026; it was the most terrifying sword-intent Ning had ever sensed. The [Nameless] sword-art, Violetjewel, the Forest of Sword Pagodas&#x2026; none of these things had ever given Ning such a sensation before.</p><p>It was vast, it was awe-inspiring, and it was unfathomably ancient. It made Ning feel like he was back on Earth, staring into the endless sea of stars.</p><p>&#x201C;Eh?&#x201D; When Ning reached within thirty meters of the broken sword, a surge of invisible force suddenly stopped him from moving any farther. No matter how Ning tried, he was unable to take so much as a single extra step.</p><p>&#x201C;I actually can&#x2019;t go any closer to it?&#x201D; By now, Ning realized that there were no other swords within thirty meters of the broken sword. &#x201C;And it doesn&#x2019;t have a price tag on it?&#x201D;</p><p>The other swords all had clearly labeled prices on the stone steles. Only this broken sword was different. There was nothing within thirty meters of it, not even a stone stele.</p><p>Ning gave it a long, deep look, firmly engraving it into his memory.</p><p>Roughly a third of the Armaments Gorge was set aside for swords. The rest was used to hold many other types of treasures and unique artifacts, and they too had prices listed next to them.</p><p>&#x201C;Fifty thousand cubes.&#x201D; &#x201C;Two million cubes.&#x201D; &#x201C;Ten million cubes.&#x201D; &#x201C;A hundred and ten thousand cubes.&#x201D;</p><p>The treasures and artifacts all had different prices.</p><p>Ning wanted to acquire Dao lightning. Things like Watersmoke Lightning, Firecloud Lightning, or Azurewood Lightning represented the Five Elements and thus were fairly cheap, requiring roughly two hundred thousand cubes. Other types of Dao lightning, however, were much more expensive. The &#x2018;Felworld Lightning&#x2019; cost 1.9 million cubes, and it was the most expensive of the nine types of Dao lightning which Ning needed.</p><p>Ning was able to acquire all nine types of Dao lightning here in the Armaments Gorge, but the price was quite steep.</p><p>The Armaments Gorge even had a tenth type of Dao lightning that was naturally formed. This lightning was known as the &#x2018;Allheaven Lightning&#x2019; and cost ten million cubes, and it could only be used if one was willing to swear a lifeblood oath! The Allheaven Lightning could only be harvested by the almighty Hegemon himself, and it was unique to the Brightshore Kingdom.</p><p>If any of the other supreme organizations wished to acquire the Allheaven Lightning, they would have to pay an utterly shocking fee to the Brightshore Kingdom. Only for actual members of the Brightshore Kingdom would such a &#x2018;low&#x2019; price of ten million cubes be accepted.</p><p>&#x201C;Daolord Allgod himself was only able to acquire nine suitable types of Dao lightning, at which point he created his [Novessence Thunder].&#x201D; Ning couldn&#x2019;t help but sigh. &#x201C;But the Brightshore Kingdom actually has ten types&#x2026;&#x201D;</p><p>Ning&#x2019;s horizons truly were broadened after he spent some time wandering through the Armaments Gorge. He finally began to realize how many treasures existed in the primordial chaos.</p><p>&#x201C;Darknorth, done already?&#x201D; Swordfive, one of the two golems guarding outside, asked Ning curiously, &#x201C;What treasure have you chosen?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;I was looking for but unable to find nine types of divine water, including Netherstring Water and Wormwind Water,&#x201D; Ning said. He was going to train in the [Novessence Water] secret art and needed nine types of water.</p><p>Fire could be classified into Elder fire (such as Golden Solarfire), Chaos fire, and Dao fire. The same was true for water. When Elder Gods or Ancestral Immortals were touched by Wormwind Water, they would find their bodies riddled with holes. Even their truesoul would begin to collapse.</p><p>&#x201C;Oh, Chaos water?&#x201D; The nearby Swordsix said in a low voice, &#x201C;The Sword Palace doesn&#x2019;t have low-level water like that. One of the other palaces, the Palace of Kindwater, definitely has it. If you really need it, we can have the Kindwater Palace deliver it to you.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;I need nine types of Chaos water.&#x201D; Ning carefully listed out the number types of Chaos water he needed.</p><p>The [Novessence Water] was also divided into two parts. The upper part involved using nine types of Chaos water, while the lower part involved using nine types of Dao water.</p><p>This was a technique which was on par with the [Novessence Lightning]. However, because of certain innate properties of lightning, the [Novessence Thunder] was slightly more powerful. Once these two techniques were used in unison then they would become much more powerful, especially considering that water and lightning were mutually complimentary elements. It must be understood that when Daolord Allgod used all nine secret arts together, he had been able to suppress even Eternal Emperors.</p><p>&#x201C;Right. In the Armaments Gorge, I was only able to find a copy of the third Mirrorsnow Painting?&#x201D; Ning looked at Swordfive and Swordsix.</p><p>&#x201C;That&#x2019;s the only one we have,&#x201D; Swordfive said. &#x201C;Emperor Mirrorsnow was a rather dissolute and wanton figure, but his sword-arts were exceedingly profound. Countless World-level cultivators were driven mad with lust for his paintings. If it wasn&#x2019;t for the fact that only World-level cultivators are permitted to study from his legacies, they would probably be much more expensive.&#x201D;</p><p>Ning agreed with this assessment. Emperor Mirrorsnow&#x2019;s legacies actually provided even Daolords with good experience. If Daolords could learn from them, the price would become astonishingly high.</p><p>The only reason why the price was fairly low was because Emperor Mirrorsnow had decreed that only World-level cultivators could study his legacy. How much money could a World-level cultivator possibly have? Still, every single painting was usually worth around a hundred thousand cubes of chaos nectar.</p><p>&#x201C;I need the fourth Mirrorsnow Painting,&#x201D; Ning said.</p><p>&#x201C;The fourth?&#x201D; Swordfive and Swordsix exchanged a glance.</p><p>&#x201C;It isn&#x2019;t present within the Brightshore Kingdom. We&#x2019;ll need to rely on the strength and reach of the Twelve Palaces in order to find it somewhere else in the primordial chaos,&#x201D; Swordfive said. &#x201C;If you want us to do that&#x2026; before we begin, you&#x2019;ll have to pay a certain amount of chaos nectar as a deposit. Also, if you search for one specific painting, it&#x2019;ll probably end up costing you much more money.</p><p>&#x201C;I can accept any price under half a million cubes,&#x201D; Ning said.</p><p>&#x201C;That&#x2019;s fine, then.&#x201D; Swordfive nodded. &#x201C;Generally speaking, it costs us around two hundred thousand cubes when we purchase one from the outside world. It&#x2019;ll just take us a bit of time. Three hundred thousand cubes is usually the maximum. Just wait for me to send word. Once the Twelve Palaces find the fourth Mirrorsnow Painting, I&#x2019;ll immediately inform you.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;How long will it take, roughly?&#x201D; Ning asked.</p><p>&#x201C;Anywhere from ten years to a thousand years.&#x201D; Swordfive was rather smug. &#x201C;The Twelve Palaces are quite influential in the Endless Territories.&#x201D;</p><p>Ning was speechless.</p><p>Many of the Daolords of the Twelve Palaces had been abducted from other places when they were at the World level. Ning himself was a good example of this. He had been a member of Vastheaven Palace, which was under the Dao Alliance. He was now here in the Brightshore Kingdom, but it was guaranteed that there was no way he would separate himself from the Dao Alliance. This was the reason why the Twelve Palaces had such influence throughout the Endless Territories.</p><p>&#x201C;Within the gorge, I found a broken sword that I couldn&#x2019;t even get close to,&#x201D; Ning suddenly said.</p><p>&#x201C;Couldn&#x2019;t get close to?&#x201D; Swordfive was startled for a moment, then nodded. &#x201C;That means you two aren&#x2019;t destined to be together.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Not destined?&#x201D; Ning was puzzled.</p><p>&#x201C;What, did you think that it was some sort of a formation preventing you from moving closer to it?&#x201D; Swordfive asked.</p><p>&#x201C;Wasn&#x2019;t it?&#x201D; Ning was even more puzzled now.</p><p>The nearby Swordsix said, &#x201C;Of course not! The formations within the Armaments Gorge are only there to prevent you from taking away the treasures without paying the price. Generally speaking, you can get close to and touch the weapons. You were able to do so with the other weapons, right? But that broken sword is so innately powerful that it can actually prevent you from going too close to it.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Only one with the right karmic destiny will be permitted to move close to it. If it refuses to acknowledge you, there is nothing you can do.&#x201D; Swordfive glanced at Ning. &#x201C;Not even the two Palace Lords of our Sword Palace were acknowledged by it. After its previous master perished, it has stayed by itself in the Armaments Gorge. It has been silent for a long, long time.&#x201D;</p><p>Ning blinked.</p><p>Alright, then. If even the Palace Lords, the Vice Palace Lords, and the countless generations of Daolords had failed to receive its approval, it only made sense that Ning himself was unable to receive its approval as well.</p><p><br></p><hr><p><br></p>
