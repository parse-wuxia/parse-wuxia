<p>Streaks of light flew out from the Flameland Elder Hall. The Sithe descendants were absolutely fearless, and they charged out with a mixture of both frenzy and despair.</p><p>Hawkfang silently watched from afar. He suddenly had the feeling that those streaks of light were utterly beautiful&#x2026; yet at the same time, they stabbed against his heart like daggers. In truth, the torment he had felt in his heart over the course of many aeons had been utterly excruciating. This was why he had never been able to perfect his Dao-heart!</p><p>&#x201C;Death is a form of release. My friends&#x2026; if all of you die, what would be the point of me surviving by myself? To continue being a disposable pawn to the Sithe?&#x201D; A calm look appeared in Hawkfang&#x2019;s eyes, and he began to release the two monsters trapped within the Flameland Elder Hall. Clack clack clack clack&#x2026; the prison cells located within the deepest depths of the Elder Hall began to swing open, awakening two mighty creatures that had existed since antiquity.</p><p>Boom. Boom. Boom. The entire Flameland Elder Hall began to shake. After awakening, the two strange creatures instantly entered a berserk state. It was extremely hard to control these creatures, but somewhat easier to drive them so berserk that they would attack all foes before them.</p><p>The Sithe generally treated these creatures as their final trump cards. The creatures were sent out to fight only when the Sithe were on their last legs.</p><p>&#x201C;They&#x2019;ve all gone.&#x201D; Hawkfang watched those hundreds of streaks of light shot from the Flameland Elder Hall towards the distant region covered by the Sword Dao Domain&#x2026; but those who entered it disappeared without a trace.</p><p>&#x201C;I&#x2019;ll go as well.&#x201D; Hawkfang could sense those two creatures beginning to awaken and cause destruction. The power within his Daoguard Tower had finally been used up. Without any energy to power its artifacts and formations, the Daoguard Tower was completely incapable of restraining these two mighty beasts any further. The two were beginning to tear it apart&#x2026; and in truth, Hawkfang didn&#x2019;t care.</p><p>He had already committed himself irrevocably to this path once he had split the Elder Hall away from its foundation. Even if the depleted tower wasn&#x2019;t destroyed, it would be of little use; at most, he could detach a few weapons and use them.</p><p>&#x201C;Attack!&#x201D; Hawkfang shot out like a streak of light, charging with determination towards the distant Ning. He was the last of the Hegemons and Emperors in his group to attack.</p><p>&#x2026;&#x2026;</p><p>Exalt Bowenya and Jonnbech all watched as those hundreds of streaks of light shot out towards Daolord Darknorth, followed by the final streak of light which represented Hawkfang. Both of them were silent.</p><p>As for Ning, he was absolutely delighted. He had long ago put away his castle and was actively manipulating his Sword Dao Domain instead. He flew through the air, moving towards those attacking Emperors as his domain moved with him as well. As soon as the Emperors entered his reach, they were trapped by illusions and captured with ease.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom! The Hegemons and Emperors continued to launch frenzied attacks, but none of them landed on Ning at all. At most, Ning would have to exert a tiny bit of power to use evasion-arts to dodge. And so&#x2026; all of the Hegemons and Emperors, Hawkfang included, were captured in one fell swoop. He drew all of them into his estate-world.</p><p>&#x201C;Now that is that?&#x201D; Just as Ning was feeling quite satisfied with himself and preparing to review the memories of these Hegemons, he suddenly turned to stare at the crumbling Flameland Elder Hall with a slightly tense look on his face.</p><p>BOOM! A giant hole appeared in the side of the Flameland Elder Hall, followed by a creature that looked like a giant fish flying out of the opening. The giant fish quickly expanded in size when it flew out, expanding to become thirty thousand kilometers long. It had long whiskers around its mouth, and those whiskers were all ten thousand kilometers as well. It also had a total of eighteen sets of claws located alongside its flank. As for its tail, the tip of its tail was connected to a series of slender threads which chopped through space with terrifying power as they swished back and forth.</p><p>&#x201C;What an incredible beast.&#x201D; Ning felt a sense of threat. &#x201C;I have the feeling that it is even tougher to deal with than the last beast I encountered.&#x201D;</p><p>Squish. Squish. Squish. Right at this moment, another strange creature that looked something like an earthworm began to slowly ooze its way out of the main gates of the Flameland Elder Hall. The creature emanated a halo of golden light, and when Ning saw it he immediately had the feeling that its body was incredibly tough. Even if Ning chopped it into ten pieces, it probably still wouldn&#x2019;t die. Killing it would be no easy task.</p><p>&#x201C;I need to find their essence cores before I can kill them,&#x201D; Ning mused. &#x201C;But both are extremely hard to deal with. It&#x2019;ll probably take me ten or twenty strikes to kill them&#x2026; but why should I have to?&#x201D;</p><p>Ning exert his will as he landed upon the ground beneath him. He had already flown out of the Sacred Mountains and into an empty plains, and when he landed on the plains he exerted the power of his Illusion Sword Dao, vanishing without a trace. He was using his illusions to blend into his surroundings, completely masking his aura and revealing no traces of his presence at all.</p><p>&#x201C;Kill&#x2026; kill&#x2026; kill&#x2026;&#x201D; These two creatures came from outside the Chaosverse, and they were born with incredibly powerful bodies. Their eyes were filled with savagery as they scanned the area, searching for living beings to kill. And yet&#x2026; after doing so, they ended up turning and charging towards the two remaining Elder Halls instead! Both of those Elder Halls were easily locatable, and they could sense that both held living beings within them.</p><p>&#x201C;Damn! It really was all an illusion. Daolord Darknorth&#x2019;s illusions are truly&#x2026;&#x201D; Exalt Bowenya turned pale when he saw this. These were clearly HIS beasts, but upon being unable to find Ning they chose to charge towards him instead!</p><p>They had captured these beasts and driven them berserk. For these beasts to now attack them was a form of karma.</p><p>Boom! Squish! The two creatures parted ways, separating as they moved towards the two Elder Halls. They began to launch a frenzied barrage of attacks upon their respective Elder Halls. Their mighty bodies contained an even more massive amount of energy than Flamewing! It gave them all the power they needed to furiously assault the towers to give vent to their hate. They even opened their giant mouths to bite down at the towers&#x2026; but the two Elder Halls would not be so easily shaken by the likes of them!</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom! The two Elder Halls began to counter-attack with near-Autarch levels of might. The attacks left gaping wounds on the bodies of the two creatures. The earthworm creature was able to endure nearly a hundred blows before finally being blasted apart, at which point its essence core was destroyed and it perished. As for the giant fish, when it was on the verge of dying it actually came back to its senses and bored into the earth to flee.</p><p>&#x201C;It regained its mind?&#x201D; Exalt Bowenya was quite shocked. &#x201C;We had driven it completely insane, but it somehow managed to come back to its senses. Near-death experiences truly can give birth to miracles.&#x201D;</p><p>He didn&#x2019;t worry about that giant fish-creature too much, because the Sacred Realm was so stable that there was no way the creature would be able to break free and escape from it. After he dealt with the biggest problem, &#x2018;Daolord Darknorth&#x2019;, he would have plenty of time to handle the fish and recapture it.</p><p>&#x201C;Daolord Darknorth.&#x201D; Exalt Bowenya stared off into the distance, his gaze focused upon the plains where Ning had vanished. Daolord Darknorth was a thousand times more dangerous than that giant fish!</p><p>&#x2026;&#x2026;</p><p>Ning had hidden himself via his power over illusions. And upon doing so he had immediately summoned Hawkfang.</p><p>Hawkfang had been someone whom the Sithe had held great hopes for. He had a chance of becoming an Autarch, and was the son of a Sithe Exalt. Ning had searched the memories of over 2,800 Sithe Emperors to no avail. By now, he felt certain that his chances of finding those nine techniques in the memories of ordinary Emperors were extremely slim. Hawkfang, however, was special. Perhaps he might have something.</p><p>Whoosh. The black-robed Hawkfang appeared before Ning. His gaze was calm, and he even smiled slightly when he saw Ning appear before him. &#x201C;Daolord Darknorth.&#x201D;</p><p>Ning didn&#x2019;t say anything, immediately drawing Hawkfang into an illusion. He was afraid that Hawkfang would try to commit suicide in the hopes of killing him. If that happened, Ning wouldn&#x2019;t have a chance to search his memories. They would have plenty of time to chat later. The nine techniques, however, were absolutely critical to him and his hopes of proceeding further along the path of cultivation. He wouldn&#x2019;t take any risks with that.</p><p>&#x201C;This is certainly a great deal of memories.&#x201D; Ning began to review Hawkfang&#x2019;s memories. Hawkfang&#x2019;s Dao-heart was flawed, and so he wasn&#x2019;t able to resist Ning&#x2019;s illusions.</p><p>Ning couldn&#x2019;t help but sigh as he flipped through Hawkfang&#x2019;s memories. Hawkfang was a rather tragic figure. If he had been born amongst the cultivators, he probably would&#x2019;ve already become an Autarch.</p><p>&#x201C;What?! He also swore a lifeblood oath not to transmit the nine techniques to anyone?&#x201D; Ning felt rather speechless when he saw the thought-bubbles surrounding those nine techniques. He had expected this, but he had still been hoping that Hawkfang would be different. In truth, however&#x2026; every single Sithe given access to these techniques had been forced to swear lifeblood oaths. Hawkfang was no exception.</p><p>&#x201C;Ugh.&#x201D; Ning felt rather disappointed after being unable to access the nine techniques, but he continued to flip through Hawkfang&#x2019;s other memories.</p><p>Time slowly flowed on. Two hours. Four hours&#x2026;</p><p>&#x201C;What&#x2019;s this?&#x201D; Ning&#x2019;s eyes slowly began to light up as he began to flip through the memories faster and faster. The more he saw, the more excited he became&#x2026; and towards the end, he was so excited that his entire body was quivering.</p><p>&#x201C;The [Five Truncheon Chapters]!&#x201D;</p><p><br></p><hr><p><br></p>
