<p>Ji Ning&#x2019;s soul was comparable to many Earth Immortals and Loose Immortals, and [Soldiers of the Mind] was even more formidable than the [Soulslayer Art] technique. The power of his assault&#x2026;it was so great that both the black-robed man and the silver-haired woman felt their souls rumble as they were sent into a dazed state. Only the silver-robed youth was dazed momentarily before immediately regaining consciousness.</p><p>&#x201C;Not good.&#x201D; The silver-robed youth was shocked. &#x201C;Even I passed out for a moment; how can junior apprentice-brother and junior apprentice-sister withstand that?&#x201D;</p><p>However, at this moment, he could not do anything for the two of them, because Ning was pouncing towards him.</p><p>&#x201C;Who on earth is this person? He is so powerful that just by using a divine will attack, he was able to set me back?&#x201D; The silver-robed youth&#x2019;s heart clenched, and he didn&#x2019;t dare to be the least bit overconfident. He hadn&#x2019;t been able to recognize Ning, who had only used a single lotus technique so far.</p><p>&#x201C;Your divine will attacks are formidable, but I refuse to believe that you are that formidable in actual combat as well.&#x201D; A cold look flashed through the eyes of the silver-robed youth. &#x201C;Die!&#x201D;</p><p>BAM! The power of the enormous, three hundred meter long greatsword was now completely focused on the tip, where black and white light had joined together to form a strand of golden sword-light. The silver-robed youth had already poured all of his power into this attack. A powerful soul might be stem from a person&#x2019;s birth; although the black-haired youth that was pouncing towards him had a powerful soul, he didn&#x2019;t necessarily have a high level of insight into the Dao.</p><p>&#x201C;Die!&#x201D; The charging Ning showed no mercy at all. The layers of the Waterflame Lotus swiveling around him blocked the massive sword, which repeatedly hacked against it but was firmly stopped.</p><p>A cold light flashed through Ning&#x2019;s eyes.</p><p>Divine ability &#x2013; [Starseizing Hand]!</p><p>CLANK! The Darknorth sword in Ning&#x2019;s hand instantly lit out a brilliant flash of sword-light, and with a massive boom, it collided against and actually knocked that enormous enemy sword flying. As for Ning, after the sword in his left hand knocked the massive sword flying, he immediately used the [Windwing Evasion] technique to arrive in front of the silver-robed youth.</p><p>The silver-robed youth was tremendously shocked. He couldn&#x2019;t believe that his most powerful technique had been knocked away by a single sword blow. He was one of the most elite of geniuses within his school! He no longer had the courage to fight against Ning, and he immediately produced dozens of talismans and threw them all away.</p><p>He had given up his talismans and was planning to flee.</p><p>It must be understood that the Brightmoon Diagram of the Mountains and Rivers was a Pure Yang magic treasure; naturally, it had a soul as well. There was no way that Ning and the others could deceive the spirit of the Diagram as to how many talismans they had. They had to throw out all of their talismans in order to be teleported away.</p><p>Swish!</p><p>Ning&#x2019;s sword-light had already arrived in front of the silver-robed youth. Clang! The silver-robed youth used both his earthfire and his chains, striving to buy himself just a single moment of time.</p><p>BOOM!!!</p><p>Ning&#x2019;s sword-light was like an attack unleashed by one of those ancient, primordial Fiendgods. It possessed an utterly shocking power that shattered the earthfire and sent the chains flying. The body of the silver-robed youth, when struck, was instantly turned into pulp. Blood sprayed everywhere, along with chunks of flesh and bits of bone, but even as it sprayed everywhere, it was completely vaporized in midair by the terrifying sword-ki.</p><p>It was all too fast!</p><p>Although the silver-robed youth had already thrown away the talismans&#x2026;there was an extremely short window of time between the talismans being thrown away and himself being teleported away. In a true, close quarters battle, that window of time was enough for Ning to attack ten more times with his sword!</p><p>Ning felt hatred for these three for daring to act against his senior apprentice-sister, and so he showed no mercy at all. In addition, the silver-robed youth truly was quite powerful; without using the [Starseizing Hand], Ning would only at most be able to seize an advantage; he wouldn&#x2019;t be able to cause the foe to completely collapse at all. He had to use his [Starseizing Hand], and use overwhelming raw power to deal with this foe!</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The two enormous phoenixes of fire and ice struck against the bodies of the other two temporarily stunned Adepts. Although the stunning effect was only for a short moment, Yu Wei was a true expert as well; she naturally seized the chance to immediately change from defending to attacking as she sent her phoenix of fire and her phoenix of ice to separately attack the black-robed man and the silver-haired woman, instantly killing the two!</p><p>Yu Wei then turned her head, looking at the black-robed youth who was 54 meters tall, crackling with lightning, and who had a vertical eye-slit in his forehead. She was both excited and nervous.</p><p>&#x201C;Senior apprentice-sister.&#x201D; Ning&#x2019;s third eye closed. The lightning around his body vanished. He returned to the size of a normal person.</p><p>&#x201C;Junior apprentice-brother.&#x201D; Yu Wei spoke out as well, and her eyes glistened like jewels.</p><p>&#x2026;&#x2026;</p><p>The main hall of the Skylight Palace.</p><p>&#x201C;Those three are disciples of my Heavenly Silkworm Sect. That black-robed woman is almost finished; yet another is going to be a slain and vanquished corpse of my Heavenly Silkworm Sect.&#x201D; An extremely skinny and shriveled Celestial Immortal was laughing smugly right now. Normally, when in front of their own disciples, these individuals would maintain the majestic decorum expected of a Celestial Immortal. Here, however, in front of all of these other Celestial Immortals, they would revealed his true personality, acting with abandon. When it was time to be smug, they would be smug; when it was time to mock, they would mock.</p><p>&#x201C;That black-robed maiden is quite formidable as well. Look at those two techniques of hers; one is a phoenix of fire, the other a phoenix of ice. As I see it, she has absolutely mastered two complete Dao-Paths.&#x201D; Next to the first Celestial Immortal was a laughing fat man whose robe was open, revealing his chest.</p><p>&#x201C;Right. She has mastered two complete Dao-Paths. That&#x2019;s the only reason why she was able to hold off the attacks of three of my sect&#x2019;s disciples for a period of time,&#x201D; the skinny, shriveled Celestial Immortal said confidently.</p><p>&#x201C;Do you know which school the black-robed maiden comes from?&#x201D; The bare-chested fat Immortal asked.</p><p>&#x201C;No idea.&#x201D; The wizened Celestial Immortal shook his head. &#x201C;Who knows what minor sect she&#x2019;s from? Major sects naturally sent quite a few disciples, who would usually travel in pairs or trios.&#x201D;</p><p>The fat Immortal&#x2019;s eyes suddenly lit up. &#x201C;Help has arrived.&#x201D;</p><p>The shriveled Celestial Immortal&#x2019;s eyes narrowed. He, too, saw that within the enormous Diagram, a black-robed youth had suddenly appeared to assist the black-robed maiden being attacked by those three Adepts of his.</p><p>The black-robed youth was ridiculously powerful. He instantly defeated the three, as easily though he were bursting through rotting wood, and in the end all three died.</p><p>&#x201C;Hmph.&#x201D; The shriveled Celestial Immortal couldn&#x2019;t help but frown. He slammed his wineglass against the table, appearing to be quite vexed.</p><p>&#x201C;Bahaha, didn&#x2019;t you say the black-robed maiden was going to die?&#x201D; The chubby Celestial Immortal began to laugh loudly.</p><p>In truth, Celestial Immortals like them didn&#x2019;t care too much about the deaths of these geniuses; after all, geniuses came every three centuries. Their deaths were minor matters. However, when so many Celestial Immortals were gathered together, they naturally hoped that the disciples of their school would be outstanding and earn some face for them from their peers.</p><p>But of course&#x2026;that was just a matter of face.</p><p>&#x2026;&#x2026;</p><p>The thousand Celestial Immortals down below were chatting amongst themselves. Up high, the Xia Emperor and the other eight Pure Yang True Immortals were chatting as well.</p><p>&#x201C;Look there!&#x201D; Lu Dongbin&#x2019;s eyes suddenly lit up as he pointed towards a corner of the Diagram. &#x201C;Look at the black-robed girl being attacked by those three. A black-robed youth appeared next to them. Look, quick! See that look in the black-robed girl&#x2019;s eyes? That look in her eyes that instantly appeared when she looked at the black-robed youth&#x2026;bahaha, a gaze that is extremely complicated, as though long-suppressed emotions were instantly unleashed! Although it was only for an instant, I daresay that this black-robed woman must have fallen in love!&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Fallen in love?&#x201D; The Xia Emperor, the Bodhisattva of Great Strength, Sovereign Hao, the Immortal Elder of the Northlands&#x2026;they all were completely speechless.</p><p>They had followed Lu Dongbin&#x2019;s pointing finger to watch, and they had been paying attention to Ning who had exploded with power. Who would&#x2019;ve thought that Lu Dongbin, however, was paying attention to the look in Yu Wei&#x2019;s eyes?</p><p>&#x201C;That gaze&#x2026;ahaha&#x2026;it was really&#x2026;not only has this woman fallen in love, I daresay that she&#x2019;s never confessed it to this black-robed youth before.&#x201D; Lu Dongbin swept his gaze across the other True Immortals, then laughed smugly, &#x201C;Any of you want to bet with me on this?&#x201D;</p><p>The Xia Emperor and the others exchanged glances, all feeling quite resigned.</p><p>&#x201C;Senior apprentice-brother Xiamang, that black-robed youth of yours is rather formidable,&#x201D; Emperor Hao congratulated.</p><p>The Xia Emperor laughed. &#x201C;The black-robed youth is named Ji Ning. He numbers amongst the few dozen most famous figures participating in this Conclave of Immortal Destiny. His Primaltwin has even killed a Loose Immortal.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Oh?&#x201D; The True Immortals present all nodded, but to them, killing a Loose Immortal was an extremely minor matter. They naturally wouldn&#x2019;t pay too much attention to it. What they cared more about was if any of the many geniuses present at this Conclave would become one of the powerful experts of the Three Realms in the future. And if so&#x2026;who would it be?</p><p>&#x201C;One of the few dozen most famous? He lives up to the reputation.&#x201D; The Bodhisattva of Great Strength smiled and praised him.</p><p>They actually didn&#x2019;t feel that Ning was particularly outstanding; after all, in the past five days of the Conclave, quite a few members of the hundred thousand-plus competitors had revealed astonishing levels of power. They were all Wanxiang Adepts, but had been capable of exploding forth with power comparable to an ordinary Loose Immortal&#x2019;s&#x2026;and in fact, there were two Wanxiang Adept monsters who had comprehended five complete Dao-Paths.</p><p>Comprehended five Dao-Paths? Even this wasn&#x2019;t enough to shock the Pure Yang True Immortals present.</p><p>This was because they felt that it wasn&#x2019;t too shocking for some peerless geniuses to have mastered five complete Dao-Paths after having spent three hundred years at the Wanxiang level, all for the purpose of surprising everyone at this Conclave.</p><p>Pure Yang True Immortals like them&#x2026;they were major figures of the Three Realms, and so naturally their vision was quite broad. If one looked at the Three Realms as a whole, it was indeed not rare for competitors with five mastered Dao-Paths to appear at the Conclave.</p><p>&#x201C;That little lass is quite interesting, quite interesting.&#x201D; Lu Dongbin was rather intrigued now, and he laughed in a self-congratulating manner, &#x201C;Yep&#x2026;that black-robed maiden&#x2019;s been hiding her feelings all along. I wonder when she will voice them?&#x201D;</p><p>The nearby Xia Emperor and the others just pretended not to hear anything.</p><p>Everyone knew that what Lu Dongbin loved to do was play matchmaker. This was one of his favorite hobbies, and in fact, stories about him playing matchmaker were extremely common throughout the Three Realms. They could tell that Lu Dongbin was feeling the impulse to do so once more. He might add a bit of &#x2018;spice&#x2019; into the relationship between the black-robed maiden and the black-robed youth.</p><p>&#x2026;&#x2026;</p><p>Ninelotus sat in the lotus position behind the Dongyan Forefather. Her head had been raised this entire time as she stared at the Diagram. She was mainly paying attention to the six disciples sent by the Dongyan clan and the three from the Black-White College&#x2026;but of course, she paid the most attention to Ji Ning!</p><p>&#x201C;Not good. Senior apprentice-sister Yu Wei is in danger.&#x201D; A look of worry appeared on Ninelotus&#x2019; face as her hands clenched around her robes.</p><p>&#x201C;Ji Ning. Ji Ning is nearby.. Ji Ning, hurry up and notice it, hurry!&#x201D; Ninelotus hoped it would happen.</p><p>And indeed, just as she had hoped, Ning had sensed the ripples from the battle. He had immediately moved in that direction, and had even displayed an astonishing amount of power. All three died, and Ning and Yu Wei were reunited.</p><p>&#x201C;Whew. The danger is past. Senior apprentice-sister Yu Wei is safe.&#x201D; Ninelotus let out a sigh. &#x201C;Now, senior apprentice-sister Yu Wei and Ji Ning can move together and support each other. It will be much safer for them.&#x201D;</p><p>Suddenly, Ninelotus&#x2019; heart trembled.</p><p>It was only natural and normal for Ji Ning and Yu Wei to travel together; they were fellow disciples, after all. It was normal for them to support each other. But Ninelotus suddenly realized&#x2026;Ji Ning and Yu Wei, a single man and an unmarried woman, would be together for most likely an entire year.</p><p>&#x201C;A single man and an unmarried woman&#x2026;experiencing life and death together&#x2026;for nearly a year&#x2026;&#x201D; Ninelotus suddenly shook her head gently. &#x201C;But I no longer have any right to think about such matters.&#x201D;</p><p>Love was a strange thing.</p><p>They had clearly already separated, but upon seeing Ji Ning with Yu Wei, she felt as though a stone had just hammered against her heart, causing ripples that would be difficult to calm down.</p><p><br></p><hr><p><br></p>
