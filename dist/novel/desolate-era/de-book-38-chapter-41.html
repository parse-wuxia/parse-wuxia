<p>Within the Azureflower Estate.</p><p>Boom! The black-robed Ji Ning was seated in the lotus position. Suddenly, the sword-light coming from his body dramatically increased in luminosity and power! The might of his aura spread out in every direction, causing even the elderly white-haired spirit of the estate who was watching nearby to feel a tinge of fear. The spirit couldn&#x2019;t help but lower his head and hunch over. This was an intrinsic fear that came from the very core of his being. In truth, estate-spirits could be considered a special type of lifeform.</p><p>&#x201C;Such power&#x2026;&#x201D; the white-haired elder tamped down his fear and struggled to raise his head to look at Ning.</p><p>The black-robed Ning was emanating countless streams of sword-light that were filled with an aura of utter dominance and exaltedness. The only time the long-lived white-haired elder had ever seen anyone like this had been when he had served his almighty master, Autarch Awakener.</p><p>&#x201C;The Omega Daos live up to their reputation. If he succeeds in the Daomerge, perhaps the only people who will be a match for him in the entire Chaosverse shall be the Autarchs,&#x201D; the white-haired elder mused silently.</p><p>Once an Omega Dao became eternal, how powerful would it become? No one knew. This was because no one thus far had ever been able to accomplish such a thing. The vast Chaosverse had given birth to numerous Autarchs, but it had never given birth to an Emperor of an Omega Dao!</p><p>The Hegemons and Otherverse Lords, no matter how talented, were at most only at the Hegemonic level of insight. Beyond that was the level of Autarchy! However, one who made an Omega Dao eternal would surpass all Hegemons in terms of profundity of insight into the Dao!</p><p>&#x201C;Only two beings can surpass Hegemony. The first are the Autarchs; the second would be an Omega Eternal Emperor.&#x201D; The white-haired elder stared rather eagerly at the black-robed Ning, who continued to glow with that aura of infinitely awesome light. &#x201C;Darknorth, there has never been an Eternal Omega Dao before! If you succeed, all of Master&#x2019;s efforts would&#x2019;ve been worth it.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x2026;&#x2026;</p><p>The Azureflower Estate had been the Autarch&#x2019;s personal, private training grounds. It was filled with barriers and restrictions of such might that it naturally was able to block out all auras, including that of Ning&#x2019;s Daomerge.</p><p>Vastheaven Palace, however, was completely incapable of the same. The white-robed Ning within the Darknorth Estate of the Vastheaven Palace was also emanating blinding amounts of sword-light, and the power from his aura surged straight out of Vastheaven Palace and reached out to spread across the entire Vastheaven Everworld. In fact, the ripples spread out into the vast void outside as well. However, the farther the ripples spread, the fainter and harder-to-detect the ripples became. They quickly spread out to cover the entire Flamedragon Realmverse and then spread out into the endless Great Dark as well.</p><p>&#x201C;What&#x2019;s going on?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;What is this sense of awe and pressure?&#x201D;</p><p>The countless living beings within Vastheaven Palace, from the mortals and animals to the Eternal Emperors, all felt a sense of terror stemming from the very fiber of their being.</p><p>None of these living beings were injured, but in this instant the entire everworld fell completely silent. All of them instinctively knelt down towards the direction from whence this aura came, almost as if they were prostrating themselves and displaying submission towards an emperor.</p><p>This aura was the aura of an Eternal Omega Sword Dao! No one would dare to stand against this terrifying aura.</p><p>&#x201C;Such power! Such might! This aura is far more powerful than mine. Not even the Sithe Exalts were this powerful!&#x201D; Flamewing was able to instinctively judge the power of this aura. There had never been an Emperor who reached that level via an Eternal Omega Dao. Someone who did would be more powerful than Otherverse Lords, Sourcewalkers, and even Sithe Exalts! Only the unfathomably powerful Autarchs would be on this level of power.</p><p>&#x201C;So this is the power of the Eternal Omega Sword Dao?&#x201D; Emperor Solesky, Azurefiend, and the others all felt completely stunned. This level of power was far beyond the Hegemonic level of power.</p><p>&#x2026;&#x2026;</p><p>Whoosh! A dimensional tear appeared at the very margins of the Vastheaven Everworld, followed by a snowy-robed, white-bearded old man appearing. This was Hegemon Brightshore. A heartbeat later two more tears appeared. A man with long green hair and a green beard emerged from the first, while a dazzlingly beautiful scepter-wielding woman appeared from the second. They were Hegemon Windrain and Hegemon Netherlily.</p><p>Riiiiip. Another dimensional tear appeared off in the distance, followed by five figures emerging. The first was a golden humanoid figure, while the other four were all onyx humanoid figures. This was Lord Wulf of the Icepeak Army and four of his Black Emperors.</p><p>&#x201C;Such power.&#x201D; Everyone&#x2019;s gazes were focused towards the distant Vastheaven Palace. Vastheaven Palace was the source of this incredible, exalted aura. Simply looking at Vastheaven Palace caused them to all feel a sense of tremendous pressure! If Ning himself appeared, staring at him would cause them all to feel a sense of terror. This was something you would innately feel when you encountered someone who was at a higher level of existence than you.</p><p>&#x201C;So this is the power which comes from an Omega Dao which has gained eternity?&#x201D; Hegemon Brightshore murmured softly, &#x201C;This aura is utterly terrifying. I&#x2019;ve never sensed anything as terrifying as this.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Daolord Darknorth&#x2019;s &#x2018;Flower of Eternity&#x2019; has probably already begun to bloom,&#x201D; Hegemon Windrain said. &#x201C;If he can succeed in making it fully bloom, he&#x2019;ll gain true eternity.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Will he be dazzling for an instant, or dazzling for all eternity? The answer will come soon,&#x201D; Hegemon Netherlily said.</p><p>They had witnessed many Daolords undergone the Daomerge and thus they understood the process. The aura of the Eternal Omega Sword Dao which they could all sense wasn&#x2019;t being consciously produced by Ning; rather, it was something which naturally manifested as the Daomerge began. Only if he succeeded in the Daomerge and truly gained a complete Eternal Omega Sword Dao would he gain control over that terrifying level of power! If he failed? Everything would disappear like mist, and his brief moment of brilliance would amount to nothing more than a testament to how powerful an Eternal Omega Sword Dao truly was.</p><p>&#x201C;He has begun the Daomerge.&#x201D; Lord Wulf stared from afar, a look of dread in his eyes. &#x201C;How terrifying. If he succeeds in the Daomerge, not even the Lonely King would stand any chance against him.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;There&#x2019;s no way something as unearthly powerful as this can exist,&#x201D; one of his Black Emperor subordinates said.</p><p>&#x201C;Agreed. If he succeeds in the Daomerge, he&#x2019;ll probably be invincible unless an Autarch intervenes,&#x201D; Lord Wulf murmured softly. &#x201C;But if he fails&#x2026; that&#x2019;ll be when he becomes truly troublesome. No one can guess what a Daolord who has failed the Daomerge would do. More importantly, the Lonely King also will be competing against Realmslord Windgrace. The struggle over the Flamewing God will probably be the greatest battle which our Icepeak Army has ever engaged in&#x2026;&#x201D;</p><p>Although the Icepeak Army had taken part in numerous great wars, it had never faced off against an opponent of Realmslord Windgrace&#x2019;s caliber. In addition, there was a third party to this conflict&#x2026; Ji Ning and the Flamewing God who served him. Lord Wulf spoke the truth when he described this conflict as the &#x2018;greatest battle&#x2019; the Icepeak Army would have ever engaged in.</p><p>&#x201C;Daolord Darknorth won&#x2019;t go crazy, right?&#x201D; The four Black Emperors were rather nervous. They had all witnessed the Flamewing God&#x2019;s power.</p><p>&#x201C;Who knows what a Daolord who has failed the Daomerge might do?&#x201D; Lord Wulf stared at the distant Vastheaven Palace. &#x201C;However&#x2026; we must give it our best shot, no matter how dangerous it is! There&#x2019;s no way Realmslord Windgrace or our Lonely King would give up a chance to control the Flamewing God. They&#x2019;ll throw every resource they have into it.&#x201D;</p><p>The Flamewing God was more valuable than all the combined value of all the treasures Realmslord Windgrace and the Lonely King possessed. There was a limit to how powerful a Sithe war machine could be, after all&#x2026; and the greater the power, the greater the cost of activating it. Each time Realmslord Windgrace wished to use the Blacksun to fire off an attack, he had to pay an enormous price. But Flamewing? It had a virtually indestructible body and could fight without rest. The Flamewing God was more valuable than the entire Icepeak Army.</p><p>However, only the likes of the Lonely King and Realmslord Windgrace were actually interested in trying to take control over Flamewing. The ordinary soldiers and generals of the Icepeak Army, along with the likes of Hegemon Brightshore, simply felt fear! This was because no one could predict how wide-ranging and destructive such a war would become. A war on this level could easily result in the deaths of Hegemons and Black Emperors. Even the likes of Lord Wulf would perish under the might of a fully-powered Blacksun!</p><p>The only ones who stood a good chance at surviving were the Lonely King, who had numerous Sithe war machines at his disposal, and Realmslord Windgrace, who had his Blacksun. Everyone else could very well perish!</p><p>Oh, right. Daolord Darknorth would be safe, as he could hide behind the Flamewing god. However&#x2026; if Daolord Darknorth had failed the Daomerge, he might go crazy and become an even greater threat than Windgrace or the Lonely King.</p><p>&#x201C;Ugh.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Let&#x2019;s pray that he succeeds in the Daomerge.&#x201D; In truth, some of the Black Emperors were silently hoping for Ning&#x2019;s success. They would be nothing more than cannon fodder in a battle at this level, after all. Still&#x2026; all of them knew in their hearts how unlikely it was that Ning would succeed.</p><p>&#x2026;&#x2026;</p><p>The white-robed Ning in Vastheaven Palace and the black-robed Ning in the Azureflower Estate meditated silently as the Flower of Eternity began to bloom with excruciating slowness.</p><p>&#x201C;This is correct. No errors thus far.&#x201D; Ning was being incredibly careful. As soon as the flower had started to bloom, his Eternal Omega Sword Dao had begun to take form. Everything seemed so perfect and flawless&#x2026; but if he made so much as a single mistake, the Flower of Eternity would instantly begin to wither and his truesoul would begin to crumble away.</p><p>He couldn&#x2019;t afford a single mistake! Thus, Ning proceeded very slowly with the Daomerge.</p><p>Time passed on, one day after the other, and more Eternal Emperors appeared around the Vastheaven Everworld. Ning&#x2019;s exalted aura had covered all of the Flamedragon Realmverse and had even stretched out into the Great Dark. Although the aura grew increasingly weak with distance, the majority of Eternal Emperors in the Flamedragon Realmverse were able to sense it. However, realmverses were so far from each other that the aura spread just a comparatively short distance into the Great Dark before becoming completely indetectable.</p><p>&#x201C;Eh?&#x201D; Roughly half a year after the Flower of Eternity began to bloom, the faces of the white-robed Ning and the black-robed Ning simultaneously turned pale.</p><p><br></p><hr><p><br></p>
