<p>Another 129 years went by in the blink of an eye.</p><p>Whoooosh. A vortex could be seen rising into the skies in the distance, causing spacetime to be twisted and distorted. Ji Ning and the other three were in a cave close to the margins of the vortex, peering towards it.</p><p>Azurefiend murmured softly, &#x201C;According to what Realmslord Windgrace said, the most precious materials are all located deep inside the vortexes, which connect to the very deepest underground tunnels. Darknorth, shall we go in and take a look?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;No need. Our target is the Daomerge Firecloud Flower! There&#x2019;s no need for us to enter the depths of those vortexes,&#x201D; Ning said. &#x201C;If we do go in, we would be easily discovered by the Sourcewalkers.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Alright.&#x201D; Azurefiend didn&#x2019;t argue, even though he really did want to go in and give it a try. They hadn&#x2019;t picked up many treasures in the past few years, as they were afraid that scouring too much would result in them being discovered, but even so the few treasures Azurefiend had picked up were worth two or three times more than his previous networth. Thus, he wanted to go into the depths of the abyss and search for even rarer treasures&#x2026; but the only way he could do that was if he relied on Ning&#x2019;s Flamewing God.</p><p>&#x201C;The other valley Realmslord Windgrace mentioned isn&#x2019;t too far away. We should be able to reach it in around thirty years,&#x201D; Ning said. &#x201C;Let us continue.&#x201D;</p><p>Daomerge Firecloud Flowers were simply too rare. They had searched for many years but found nothing at all. They did find another Incense Spirit-Fruit, but unfortunately it was yet another unripened one.</p><p>Ning and the others had only walked for the time needed to boil a kettle of tea when suddenly&#x2026; boom! A blurry black light suddenly appeared beneath their feet, oozing out of the icy ground and forming into curved lines that stretched out trillions of kilometers.</p><p>&#x201C;Not good. That&#x2019;s a formation.&#x201D; Ning&#x2019;s face tightened. &#x201C;An alarm formation.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;We&#x2019;ve been discovered.&#x201D; Hegemon Azurefiend was shocked as well.</p><p>Rumble&#x2026; an enormous earth-shaking boom rang out in the distance as the ground began to crack apart. A titanic mountain-sized ice humanoid emerged from the ground, using his two hands to tear through it as he rose from the depths.</p><p>Ning&#x2019;s gaze narrowed. The ice here was so tough that if he didn&#x2019;t use his Northbow swords, he&#x2019;d need to use roughly 50% of his full power to break through it. Most likely, fairly powerful Archons would have to use 100% of their full power to just barely break through the ice. This person, however, had been able to instantly tear through the ground with his bare hands. This terrifying level of strength alone showed that this creature was vastly stronger than Hegemons. Most likely, he was at the Otherverse Lord level of power.</p><p>&#x201C;That&#x2019;s the Sourcewalker,&#x201D; Ning sent mentally.</p><p>&#x201C;Sourcewalker?&#x201D; Azurefiend&#x2019;s face turned pale.</p><p>&#x201C;He finally came!&#x201D; Flamewing, on the other hand, was excited. It really hated the Icewind Sea, as every single part of this place was filled with uncomfortable icy energy. When it saw the Sourcewalker, it instantly grew excited.</p><p>The Sourcewalker before them was covered in a layer of extremely thick ice which served as a form of icy armor which glowed with azure light. His head was covered with a helmet that had two icicles protruding from it, and he had long azure hair which fell down to his waist. He had a great deal of facial hair, and his gloomy azure eyes were filled with rage and violence.</p><p>&#x201C;More of you thieves, come to steal my treasures!&#x201D; The Sourcewalker let out a furious bellow, his voice transforming into a wind of terrifying power which swept out in every direction. The endless might in his voice alone caused Ning and Azurefiend to quail. The difference in power was simply too great.</p><p>&#x201C;We ran into a Sourcewalker before we even found a Daomerge Firecloud Flower. What terrible luck.&#x201D; Ning felt rather resigned. They hadn&#x2019;t even gone into any of the vortexes or deep underground, where the treasures were more abundant and more valuable. That was where the Sourcewalkers usually resided.</p><p>&#x201C;Sourcewalker,&#x201D; Ning called out loudly, &#x201C;We&#x2019;ve come here just for the sake of finding a Daomerge Firecloud Flower! Its not all that valuable, and we&#x2019;re willing to use our own treasures to trade for one. We&#x2019;ll leave immediately after acquiring the flower.&#x201D;</p><p>Daomerge Firecloud Flowers were incredible treasures for Daolords, but they were fairly ordinary when compared to the other treasures of the Icewind Sea. There were treasures here which would drive even Hegemons and Otherverse Lords mad with excitement.</p><p>&#x201C;A Daomerge Firecloud Flower?&#x201D; The ice-armored Sourcewalker was 540,000 meters tall. It stared downwards at Ning&#x2019;s group and said angrily, &#x201C;You can forget about taking away so much as a piece of ice from my turf! All you cultivators are nothing more than damnable thieves. This is my territory!&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;We can trade for it with our treasures!&#x201D; Ning said frantically.</p><p>&#x201C;Treasures? What use do I have for your miserable treasures?&#x201D; The Sourcewalker took a furious step forwards, then shot forwards through the air: &#x201C;Just die instead!&#x201D;</p><p>Ning felt speechless. This Sourcewalker was just as Realmslord Windgrace had described; a berserker!</p><p>Whoosh. The Sourcewalker wielded a long frozen halberd which gleamed with azure light, sweeping it towards Ning&#x2019;s group with such power that Ning had no choice but to instruct Flamewing to defend. &#x201C;Flamewing, go!&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Haha&#x2026; I was at the verge of losing my patience!&#x201D; The chubby Flamewing instantly let out an excited cry as it reverted to its true form, transforming into the titanic Flamewing God. Its giant flaming wings spread out fully as its body became bathed in furious flames that were so powerful, even the frigid energy of the surrounding area was pushed away. Everything within ten billion kilometers began to grow blazingly hot.</p><p>Otherverses had their own prime essences, as did the Icewind Sea&#x2026; and in a sense, the Flamewing God itself had its own prime essences! Its energy levels truly were virtually inexhaustible, and its body was virtually indestructible. Ever since it was born, it had wandered the Chaosverse and had devoured entire realmverses with ease. Truly, its power was inconceivable. Its only weakness was that its level of insight was extremely, extremely low. If it was just a bit more clever, it would be able to massacre even Otherverse Lords with ease.</p><p>Still, all things came in balance. There was no way even the prime essences of the Chaosverse could give birth to creatures as powerful as Chaos Primordials which also had the comprehension skills of Sourcewalkers. This was completely impossible.</p><p>&#x201C;A Chaos Primordial?&#x201D; The attacking Sourcewalker was rather stunned when it saw those vast wings unfurl and the flames spread out in every direction around the Flamewing God.</p><p>&#x201C;Haha, I&#x2019;ve never eaten a Sourcewalker before!&#x201D; Flamewing howled through the skies, while Ning, Azurefiend, and Whitethaw all immediately moved to hide within the realmship. They weren&#x2019;t qualified to get involved in a battle of this magnitude.</p><p>&#x201C;This is my first time meeting a Chaos Primordial as well. Let&#x2019;s do this!&#x201D; The Sourcewalker was just as eager to do battle, and he valiantly charged forwards with his halberd at the ready.</p><p>Swoosh! His halberd suddenly pierced forwards, howling through the skies with incredible speed&#x2026; but Flamewing was even faster! The strike missed, just barely managing to scrape past Flamewing&#x2019;s claws but not injuring Flamewing in the slightest.</p><p>&#x201C;Up you go!&#x201D; The Sourcewalker suddenly changed his stance. Previously, he had been using the halberd to &#x2018;stab&#x2019; at Flamewing; now, he suddenly lifted it upwards!</p><p>This was a strike that seemed to split even the heavens in two. Not even Flamewing was able to avoid this strike&#x2026; but of course, Flamewing wouldn&#x2019;t deign to do so.</p><p>Boom! Flamewing had already been flying through the air; this strike sent it stumbling a few hundred kilometers higher.</p><p>The Sourcewalker was shocked. When he had used this killer technique against the cultivator Otherverse Lords he had fought, they had all been knocked backwards and suffered heavy injuries. The Chaos Primordial had merely stumbled a bit?</p><p>&#x201C;Grwaaaar!&#x201D; Flamewing excitedly flapped its wings, instantly charging downwards while using its enormous and thick claws to strike at the Sourcewalker. The Sourcewalker hurriedly brandished his halberd, spinning it into a circle that defended against the approaching attack.</p><p>Flamewing completely ignored the profundity of his opponent&#x2019;s attack, just striking down with its claws in an absolutely savage blow. BOOM! An enormous collision rang out as the earth itself began to split apart. As for the Sourcewalker, half of its body had just been hammered into the ground from this collision.</p><p>&#x201C;I ablated over 90% of its power, but it still suppressed me completely?&#x201D; The Sourcewalker was rather speechless at this result. Moments later, the look within its eyes grew even more frenzied. &#x201C;Again!&#x201D;</p><p>Boom. Boom. Boom! The Sourcewalker was incredibly valiant. At first, it chose to meet all of Flamewing&#x2019;s attacks head on, but later on it began to choose to dodge instead in an effort to win through technique. In terms of comprehension, it was already at the Archon level of insight. Due to its innate gifts, this level of insight was already enough for it to unleash the Otherverse Lord level of power in battle! Supposedly, the legendary Sourcewalkers who could fight even Sithe Exalts were actually just at the Hegemonic level of insight.</p><p>Then again, the Hegemonic level of insight was an incredibly high level. Realmslord Windgrace, the Lonely King, and the other major powers were all at this level of insight. The only thing above this level was Autarchy.</p><p>Every so often, the Sourcewalker was sent slamming into the nearby mountains, hammered into the ground, or smashed so hard that it created deep craters and gouges in the earth beneath it.</p><p>Clearly, after Flamewing became a bit more accustomed to the way in which the Sourcewalker fought, Flamewing became able to completely dominate it in battle. The Sourcewalker had even lost his helmet, and his azure hair fluttered about wildly. He continued to roar with fury, but it was clear that he was being crushed in this fight. However, the icy armor that covered his upper body remained completely unscathed. It was quite a marvelous item.</p><p>&#x201C;Darknorth, the Sourcewalker can&#x2019;t hold back Flamewing.&#x201D; Azurefiend chuckled merrily as he watched from within the realmship. &#x201C;The Sourcewalker will probably retreat soon. If this fight continues, it&#x2019;ll be nothing but bad news for him.&#x201D;</p><p>Ning smiled and nodded as well. He was still going to be able to find the Daomerge Firecloud Flower.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom! At first, the Sourcewalker had been filled with a towering desire to do battle, but after being dominated for so long it was beginning to feel rather miserable. It had been a long, long time since it had felt this miserable.</p><p>His body wasn&#x2019;t nearly as tough as a Chaos Primordial&#x2019;s, but it was still vastly better than the bodies of cultivators. Thus, when he encountered cultivators like Realmslord Windgrace, he was able to chase down the cultivators and beat them down as he pleased. It had been quite some time since it had suffered in a fight like this.</p><p>After being slammed into a mountain yet again, the Sourcewalker angrily raised his head. His long azure hair fluttered in the wind as he roared, &#x201C;Big brother! Hurry up and come out, I&#x2019;m getting killed here!&#x201D; His roar was like thunder, and it shook the world around them.</p><p>&#x201C;Big brother?&#x201D; Within the realmship, Ning and Azurefiend&#x2019;s eyes both bulged out. &#x201C;He has a big brother?&#x201D; Ning couldn&#x2019;t help but feel rather dazed.</p><p><br></p><hr><p><br></p>
