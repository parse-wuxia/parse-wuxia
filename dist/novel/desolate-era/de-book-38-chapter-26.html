<p>Prior to visiting Realmslord Windgrace, Ji Ning had long ago sent word via the Sixteen Realmverses Alliance that he would be coming. Realmslord Windgrace was quite willing to meet with Ning as well.</p><p>The Blacksun. Ning&#x2019;s group of four was led to a courtyard within it.</p><p>Hegemon Wuye smiled: &#x201C;Master has been waiting for quite some time. When he heard that you were coming, he was quite excited. I felt quite eager as well. I&#x2019;ve heard of your illustrious reputation long ago, Darknorth, and I&#x2019;ve also heard of Flamewing God the Chaos Primordial. Today, I&#x2019;ve finally met you two.&#x201D; He was unable to disguise his interested glance towards the nearby Flamewing.</p><p>Flamewing was quite chubby, but was much larger than Wuye. When he saw Wuye, he mumbled, &#x201C;He looks yummy.&#x201D;</p><p>Hegemon Wuye&#x2019;s face turned pale and he hurriedly pushed the door open and called, &#x201C;Master!&#x201D;</p><p>There was a withered tree inside the courtyard. Below it was a prayer mat, with a disheveled-looking old man seated atop it. The old man&#x2019;s eyebrows looked quite messy, but his gaze was extremely calm. He had a smile on his face, and he pointed to the prayer mats next to him. &#x201C;Darknorth, my young friend. Sit.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Thank you, Realmslord Windgrace.&#x201D; Ning walked over and sat down on a prayer mat. Azurefiend and Whitethaw did the same, while Flamewing lazily sauntered over to a boulder and lay down on it while shaking his rump.</p><p>&#x201C;Chaos Primordials truly are extraordinary,&#x201D; Realmslord Windgrace praised. He then glanced at Ning. &#x201C;Darknorth, my young friend&#x2026; I&#x2019;m sure you didn&#x2019;t come to visit me just to show off your Chaos Primordial.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;There is indeed something I wish for you to help me with, Realmslord,&#x201D; Ning said.</p><p>&#x201C;Go ahead and explain.&#x201D; Realmslord Windgrace was quite willing to help Ning out; the more he helped Ning out, the greater his chances of acquiring the Flamewing God after Ning failed the Daomerge would be.</p><p>&#x201C;I&#x2019;ve heard legends of two marvelous items that are of tremendous use during the Daomerge. One is known as the Daomerge Firecloud Flower, while the other is known as the Incense Spirit-Fruit,&#x201D; Ning said. &#x201C;Are you aware of them, Realmslord?&#x201D;</p><p>Realmslord Windgrace looked at Ning in astonishment, then sighed. &#x201C;Impressive, truly impressive. Daolord Darknorth, how is it that you know of such incredibly rare items? Even I only learned of them due to a lucky encounter.&#x201D;</p><p>Ning was delighted. He immediately asked, &#x201C;Realmslord, do you know where they can be found?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Daomerge Firecloud Flowers and Incense Spirit-Fruits should be considered legendary treasures for Daolords attempting the Daomerge,&#x201D; Realmslord Windgrace said. &#x201C;When I served Autarch Titanos, we once discussed Daomerge treasures, with the topic focusing on the treasures that provided incredibly marvelous effects for short periods of time. Autarch Titanos praised the Daomerge Firecloud Flower as being best, with the Incense Spirit-Fruit being second.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Both of these items vastly surpass the Voidsea Jadeseals. During the Daomerge, someone who has eaten an Incense Spirit-Fruit will enter a truly profound state where his body is divided into nine different incarnations. All nine of them can test out a simulated Daomerge while the true body undergoes the real Daomerge. So long as one of the nine incarnations succeeds, the true body can succeed in the Daomerge as well,&#x201D; Realmslord Windgrace said. &#x201C;As for the Daomerge Firecloud Flower, it&#x2019;s even more remarkable. It can allow for the creation of eighty-one incarnations that will all simulate the Daomerge at the same time!&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;But of course, what I&#x2019;m saying only stands true for ordinary Daolords. The more talented a Daolord is, the more energy each incarnation consumes from an Incense Spirit-Fruit or a Daomerge Firecloud Flower. Those who have fused multiple Supreme Daos will only be able to create a single incarnation after eating an Incense Spirit-Fruit, while a Daomerge Firecloud Flower can at most maintain a total of nine incarnations. These two treasures have a similar function, which means you can only choose to use one of them. You can&#x2019;t mix and match&#x2026; and they only have these marvelous effects when you use them during your actual Daomerge.&#x201D;</p><p>Realmslord Windgrace looked at Ning and smiled. &#x201C;What, Darknorth&#x2026; do you need the Daomerge Firecloud Flower?&#x201D;</p><p>Ning was amazed. So this was the effect these items had? The Voidsea Jadeseal allowed for just a single simulated Daomerge, but it didn&#x2019;t have to be used during the actual Daomerge! The problem with it was that it just wasn&#x2019;t all that powerful in comparison. For supreme Daolords who had fused multiple Supreme Daos, it would only allow for a small part of the Daomerge to be simulated.</p><p>In comparison, the Incense Spirit-Fruit was clearly far more powerful, while the Daomerge Firecloud Flower was ridiculously effective. The problem was, they could only be used during the actual Daomerge!</p><p>&#x201C;So someone who has fused multiple Supreme Daos can have nine incarnations assisting him when he uses the Daomerge Firecloud Flower?&#x201D; Ning mused to himself, &#x201C;Then my Omega Dao&#x2026; I wonder if I&#x2019;ll have even a single incarnation.&#x201D; As for the Incense Spirit-Fruit, Ning had already mentally discarded it.</p><p>&#x201C;You train in an Omega Dao, yes?&#x201D; Realmslord Windgrace asked.</p><p>&#x201C;Yes.&#x201D; Ning acknowledged it.</p><p>&#x201C;Daomerges for Omega Daos are incredibly difficult. I imagine only the top Daomerge treasure, the Daomerge Firecloud Flower, will be of some use to you.&#x201D; Realmslord Windgrace shook his head. &#x201C;And its use will probably be highly limited. I&#x2019;ve heard of Omega Daolords who have used it but still failed. There has just never been anyone successful in an Omega Daomerge.&#x201D; Realmslord Windgrace let out a sigh.</p><p>Every single realmverse had a few Hegemons, which meant that the vast Chaosverse had a large number of them&#x2026; but it had never seen so much as a single successful Omega Daomerge!</p><p>&#x201C;As long as it helps out, I&#x2019;ll take it.&#x201D; Ning laughed. &#x201C;Anything that can increase my chances by even a sliver is a good thing. Perhaps that&#x2019;ll be the sliver that pushes me over to success during the Daomerge.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;That&#x2019;s a nice way to view it. You need that sort of attitude when you attempt the Daomerge. If you are panicking, you&#x2019;ll have lost half the battle before it even starts,&#x201D; Realmslord Windgrace said.</p><p>&#x201C;Realmslord, do you know where Daomerge Firecloud Flowers can be found?&#x201D; Ning asked.</p><p>&#x201C;I do. They can be found in several places,&#x201D; Realmslord Windgrace said. &#x201C;Daomerge Firecloud Flowers are incredibly valuable to Daolords, but to us they are nothing more than fairly unusual treasures that are generally used to create pills.&#x201D;</p><p>Ning was overjoyed. His eyes lit up as he asked, &#x201C;If the Daomerge Firecloud Flowers are used to create pills, will they perhaps be of even greater assistance during the Daomerge?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;No, no! If you use them to make pills, you&#x2019;ll actually waste the special effect they have during the Daomerge,&#x201D; Realmslord Windgrace said hurriedly. &#x201C;Daomerge Firecloud Flowers are naturally endowed with those unique properties, but once you use it to create a pill the properties are lost. In addition, they can only be used within a thousand years after they first bloom! After a thousand years go by, their aura will completely vanish and their medicinal value will drop by over 90% as well.&#x201D;</p><p>Ning nodded. &#x201C;Then where can they be harvested?&#x201D;</p><p>Realmslord Windgrace frowned. &#x201C;Are you still going to go for one? The place they are located is incredibly dangerous. I know where they can be found, but even I wouldn&#x2019;t dare to go there without a good reason. Generally speaking, several of my friends would join forces in venturing there.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;The place is that dangerous?&#x201D; Ning was surprised.</p><p>&#x201C;The Chaosverse is filled with countless marvels as well as many incredibly dangerous places. However, the Chaosverse is so vast that it&#x2019;s hard to even locate those places unless you know exactly where they are,&#x201D; Realmslord Windgrace said. &#x201C;Ordinary realmverses and otherverses would never be able to give birth to something like a Daomerge Firecloud Flower. Only some of the truly marvelous places of the Chaosverse, places which gather together countless different types of universal essence, can possibly give birth to such remarkable treasures.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;All of these places, however, are tightly protected by the prime essences of the Chaosverse,&#x201D; Realmslord Windgrace said. &#x201C;The Sithe attempted to invade and conquer many of these places and take their contents by force, but the result was that they suffered tremendously heavy casualties.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;So what type of dangers do those places hold?&#x201D; Ning asked.</p><p>&#x201C;A type of being known as a &#x2018;Sourcewalker&#x2019;,&#x201D; Realmslord Windgrace said. &#x201C;Let me put it to you like this. Normally, the Chaosverse can give birth to two extremely perfect types of beings. The first are known as the &#x2018;Chaos Godbeasts&#x2019;, while the second are known as the &#x2018;Ancients&#x2019;.&#x201D;</p><p>Ning nodded slowly. Hegemon Brightshore was a Chaos Godbeast, while Ninedust was a member of the Ancients. They were born at the World level and had incredibly perfect divine bodies.</p><p>&#x201C;Chaos Godbeasts have comparatively lower levels of comprehension, while Ancients take human form and have much higher comprehension skills,&#x201D; Realmslord Windgrace said.</p><p>Ning smiled. The only member of the Brightshore Imperials to succeed in the Daomerge was Hegemon Brightshore himself. It was incredibly difficult for Chaos Godbeasts as a race to succeed in the Daomerge. Azurefiend and Welkin were both Chaos Godbeasts, but they were the only Hegemons to have ever arisen from their race. They had no colleagues at all. They were unable or unwilling to spend their entire lives taking care of weaker Chaos Godbeasts as Hegemon Brightshore did, and so they wandered by themselves through the Chaosverse. This was something they had been accustomed to since youth. In contrast, Ancients were far more intelligent and thus had far more Eternal Emperors in comparison.</p><p>&#x201C;Chaos Godbeasts and Ancients&#x2026; they are present in virtually every realmverse. They are quite common,&#x201D; Realmslord Windgrace said. &#x201C;However&#x2026; two types of living beings are born within the prime essences of the Chaosverse, and they are even more elite. One type is fairly unintelligent, and they are known as the &#x2018;Chaos Primordials&#x2019;. The other is fairly intelligent and also has human form, and they are known as &#x2018;Chaos Essence Walkers&#x2019;, or &#x2018;Sourcewalkers&#x2019; for short.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Chaos Primordials and Sourcewalkers are born with far more exalted bloodlines than Chaos Godbeasts and Ancients,&#x201D; Realmslord Windgrace said. &#x201C;However&#x2026; they represent even greater extremes as well.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Chaos Primordials are as unintelligent as mortal children, but are born with virtually indestructible bodies. In contrast, Sourcewalkers are very intelligent and have incredible comprehension skills. They are incredibly solitary and proud figures who do not dwell in ordinary places. They delight in dwelling in treasured places where countless streams of essence from the Chaosverse gather together, and they treat those places as their own territories,&#x201D; Realmslord Windgrace said. &#x201C;Unlike Chaos Primordials, they cannot be &#x2018;tamed&#x2019;; they are simply far too intelligent. There is no way one can force them to submit.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;If you wish to go to one of those sacred places where Daomerge Firecloud Flowers can be harvested, that means you are going to steal treasures from a Sourcewalker&#x2019;s territory. You will enrage them.&#x201D; Realmslord Windgrace shook his head.</p><p>Ning pondered this matter. He wasn&#x2019;t surprised at all. Although this was his first time hearing of &#x2018;Sourcewalkers&#x2019;, he had already heard of strange beings that were on par with the Autarchs themselves. Why would he be shocked to hear that there were certain creatures on par with Chaos Primordials in might?</p><p>&#x201C;Sourcewalkers are all extremely intelligent, which means they do have a weakness; their bodies aren&#x2019;t nearly as indestructible as that of the Chaos Primordials, and they are born with much lower levels of strength. However, they can slowly cultivate and grow with time! Thus, there are varying levels of power amongst Sourcewalkers. The weaker ones are perhaps merely at the Hegemonic level, while the most powerful were supposedly on par with the Sithe Exalts, capable of killing us in an instant,&#x201D; Realmslord Windgrace said.</p><p>Ning relaxed slightly. If even the most powerful were &#x2018;merely&#x2019; on par with Sith Exalts, that meant they were still much weaker than the Autarchs. It must be remembered that it took three Sithe Exalts working together to capture the Flamewing God; a single one wasn&#x2019;t able to do the trick. Plus, he wouldn&#x2019;t be so unlucky as to run into literally the most powerful type of Sourcewalker in existence, right?</p><p>&#x201C;When the Sithe furiously invaded those sacred places to loot the treasures, they enraged the prime essences of the Chaosverse with their greed. The prime essences allowed the Sourcewalkers to borrow from the inherent power of those sacred places, resulting in them becoming much more powerful. This was why the Sithe suffered greatly for their actions,&#x201D; Realmslord Windgrace said. &#x201C;However&#x2026; you must be cautious if you do go.&#x201D;</p><p>Realmslord Windgrace suddenly waved his hand, causing a jade slip to appear. He then filled it with his godsense, imprinting it with a great deal of information.</p><p>&#x201C;This is one of the closer locations. If you ride on your realmship, you should reach it in just a few hundred thousand years. As I recall, this place has Daomerge Firecloud Flowers within it. This slip now contains all of the information I know regarding that place.&#x201D; As Realmslord Windgrace spoke, he delivered the jade slip to Ning. &#x201C;Remember, the information I provided covers just the vast majority of situations, not all situations. I didn&#x2019;t delve too deeply into that place either. You really must be careful.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Thank you, Realmslord.&#x201D; Ning accepted the slip.</p><p>&#x2026;&#x2026;</p><p>After having received the intelligence he needed, that very day Ning bade Realmslord Windgrace farewell and embarked on a return journey.</p><p>He had to first deal with Emperor Melobo, then take on ten honorary disciples for Emperor Mirrorsnow. Only then could he go adventuring with a calm heart. Anything was possible while out adventuring, after all. He might be forced to initiate the Daomerge for some reason, which would be disastrous if these karmic knots were not resolved.</p><p><br></p><hr><p><br></p>
