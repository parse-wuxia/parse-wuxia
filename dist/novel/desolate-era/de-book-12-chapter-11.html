<p>&#x201C;That&#x2019;s the Venomous Nethervulture secret art!&#x201D; Ning immediately recognized the technique. Cangwu Jiu had become famous long ago, and this Venomous Nethervulture art was his signature technique. It was an enormous Venomous Nethervulture that was formed from many magic treasures in a formation. As for Cangwu Jiu himself, he was hidden within the grand Venomous Nethervulture. Once it failed, Cangwu Jiu would emerge from within the body of the Nethervulture and enter close combat!</p><p>Yu Wei pointed towards the distant. Whoosh! All 72 Rahu Godneedles instantly appeared in midair. Filled with elemental ki, they activated the natural energy of the world to form a pair of enormous phoenixes of fire and ice. The two phoenixes simultaneously howled through the air as they charged towards the giant black vulture.</p><p>&#x201C;Shkreee!&#x201D; The black vulture let out a venomous screech, then slashed downwards viciously with his claws.</p><p>The phoenix of ice and the phoenix of ice charged upwards, but after exchanging just two blows many cracks had already appeared on their bodies. Upon their third collision against the vulture, both phoenixes completely shattered, and the 72 Rahu Godneedles were immediately knocked flying back as well.</p><p>&#x201C;Arise.&#x201D; Ning stood there, and around him manifested the Waterflame Lotus. The Waterflame Lotus surrounded him, the lotus leaves swaying gently as they continuously swiveled.</p><p>Boom&#x2026;</p><p>The charging black vulture smashed directly against the Waterflame Lotus. There was an enormous collision sound, but although some of the leaves of the Waterflame Lotus shattered, new ones quickly emerged. Clearly, this technique was incomparably resilient. This caused the relaxing, spectating Xiamang Zishan to feel startled; this was rather beyond his expectations.</p><p>After six months of tempering and especially after having thoroughly mastered both the Dao of Rainwater and the Dao of the Inferno, Ning had further perfected his Waterflame Lotus, as his powers were now in perfect equilibrium, allowing the technique to clearly grow more formidable. In addition, this was a technique which used earthfire and dire-ice of the first grade as its base; how could it be so easily defeated?</p><p>&#x201C;Quick, leave.&#x201D; Ning sent mentally.</p><p>Swoosh! Yu Wei transformed into a streak of light, immediately planning to fly away.</p><p>&#x201C;Shkreee!&#x201D; The venomous black vulture suddenly opened its mouth, and a person emerged from within it. It was Cangwu Jiu. Cangwu Jiu was wielding a scimitar in his hand, and as he flew out, his body suddenly exploded in size to become sixty meters tall. His right arm transformed into a golden color, and with a single flash, he caught up to the location in front of Yu Wei, frightening her into hurriedly retreating.</p><p>&#x201C;Go!&#x201D; Ning suddenly manifested more than seven hundred flying swords around him. A golden flying sword appeared in front of him, then shot out with a bang.</p><p>Boom! The power of the [Lesser Thousand Swords Formation] caused even Cangwu Jiu&#x2019;s body to tremble for a moment, but in the next moment, the golden right arm of Cangwu Jiu brandished that scimitar and chopped apart the flying sword of golden light. By this time, Yu Wei had fled back to the Waterflame Lotus.</p><p>&#x201C;He is too fast. I&#x2019;m not able to escape,&#x201D; Yu Wei sent frantically.</p><p>Ning understood as well. Forget about Yu Wei; even he himself wasn&#x2019;t confident in being able to escape from the attacks of Cangwu Jiu. Cangwu Jiu&#x2019;s strongest point was his speed to begin with.</p><p>&#x201C;Then I&#x2019;ll trap him!&#x201D; Ning sent. &#x201C;Senior apprentice-sister, you and I shall first block him off together!&#x201D;</p><p>Swish! Swish! Swish! One golden flying sword after another, formed from the [Lesser Thousand Swords Formation], flew out and attacked. As for Yu Wei, the 72 Rahu Godneedles in front of her flew out once more.</p><p>The [Lesser Thousand Swords Formation], the phoenix of ice, and the phoenix of fire simultaneously attacked. Cangwu Jiu, seeing everything headed his way as well as that enormous Waterflame Lotus, couldn&#x2019;t help but frown. He mentally barked, &#x201C;Xiamang Zishan, why aren&#x2019;t you helping out yet?!&#x201D;</p><p>There was no way Cangwu Jiu could dominate Ning and Yu Wei by himself, after they joined forces.</p><p>&#x201C;It&#x2019;s just two people. I thought you could handle it by yourself.&#x201D; Xiamang Zishan laughed loudly in response. &#x201C;Cangwu Jiu, remember, don&#x2019;t let these two escape. You are most skilled in pursuing and trapping enemies.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Don&#x2019;t worry about that!&#x201D; Cangwu Jiu stood there in midair, pointing towards the distance.</p><p>Instantly, a fierce gale arose in the surrounding area, howling as it spun into a tornado. The spinning tornado covered the surrounding area, stretching several kilometers and completely trapping Ning and Yu Wei within it.</p><p>&#x201C;I&#x2019;ll use the Qian-Heaven Soulwind to trap them, the Venomous Nethervulture to support it, and I&#x2019;ll personally be prepared to attack at any time,&#x201D; Cangwu Jiu sent mentally. &#x201C;Under these three techniques&#x2026;there&#x2019;s no way they&#x2019;ll escape. As for fighting them head on? I&#x2019;ll leave that to you.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Hahaha&#x2026;&#x201D;</p><p>Xiamang Zishan laughed loudly.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>His footsteps suddenly began to cause the mountains to tremble as he immediately transformed into a sixty meter tall giant, and his entire body began to radiate with a violet-colored lightning. The violet-colored lightning even began to appear in the surrounding area, and an enormous black metal staff appeared in his hands. Wielding the black metal staff, he charged into the heart of the giant tornado towards the Waterflame Lotus.</p><p>Bang!!! He unleashed a single sweeping smash from the black metal staff, but the power of it was so great it seemed capable of reversing the course of rivers. Many of the leaves of the Waterflame Lotus were completely smashed apart into two pieces.</p><p>&#x201C;Such power.&#x201D; Ning was shocked. Why was the man even more powerful than he had predicted? In the Heavenly Treasures Mountains&#x2019; reports, it didn&#x2019;t seem as though Xiamang Zishan was quite this terrifying. Ning&#x2019;s Waterflame Lotus wasn&#x2019;t even able to withstand a single blow from this man.</p><p>&#x201C;Ji Ning, right? Come!&#x201D; Xiamang Zishan laughed loudly, possessing the aura of a dominating mountain that would crush and destroy anything before it.</p><p>Ji Ning suddenly took a step forward as well. Boom! He transformed into a 54 meter tall giant, and lightning crackled around his body as well. In his hands, two Darknorth swords appeared. He charged forward, and as he did a third eye appeared in the middle of his forehead. A succession of lightning bolts slammed out towards the distant Xiamang Zishan&#x2026;who actually didn&#x2019;t dodge at all!</p><p>The violet lightning crackling around his body was enough to easily deflect Ning&#x2019;s thunderbolt strikes. As for the divine will component to the attack? He paid even less attention to that.</p><p>&#x201C;[Soldiers of the Mind].&#x201D;</p><p>An invisible, formless surge of divine will shot out, forming into sharp swords, warblades, and longspears. The weapons howled as they flew towards Xiamang Zishan&#x2019;s sea of consciousness, frantically chopping and stabbing at it.</p><p>Xiamang Zishan paused momentarily, but he then quickly regained control over himself. The savagery in his eyes only grew stronger. &#x201C;So you have some ability after all!&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;You live up to your reputation as the number one expert in the Heavenly Treasures Mountain&#x2019;s intelligence report.&#x201D; The enormous Ning charged forward, twin swords in his hands and absolute confidence in his eyes.</p><p>&#x201C;Hahaha&#x2026;&#x201D; Xiamang Zishan twirled his black metal staff, his aura of power filling the heavens. Even before his breakthrough, he had been ranked by the Heavenly Treasures Mountain as the number one figure in this crowded. Now that he had made a breakthrough, Xiamang Zishan personally believed that he had no equals left. His goal in this Conclave was to become the number one champion!</p><p>The two instantly collided against each other!</p><p>A dazzling sword-light filled the skies!</p><p>A massive staff shattered apart the Waterflame Lotus with the force of a flood!</p><p>BOOM!!!!</p><p>Ning took three steps back.</p><p>Xiamang Zishan took three steps back as well. The surrounding mountain had begun to crumble, and even the mountain peak was trembling, on the verge of collapse.</p><p>&#x201C;What?!&#x201D; Cangwu Jiu, in midair, was astonished. &#x201C;He blocked that madman Xiamang Zishan? This Ji Ning has incredibly terrifying close combat power.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;What a fellow. You actually managed to receive the third stance of my self-created Qiankun Staff of Force! Have a test of the fourth stance I just created! This is a stance which I created by fusing four complete Dao-Paths into my Grand Dao of Lightning!&#x201D; Xiamang Zishan was clearly growing even more berserk as he charged towards Ning once more, and the staff in his hands verily surged with flows of violet lightning.</p><p>As his staff smashed down, it seemed to tear apart the world itself.</p><p>Ning stepped forward to receive the blow, the Darknorth swords in his hands transforming into dazzling streaks of sword-light as they blocked the terrifying staff.</p><p>BOOM!!!!</p><p>A heavy collision.</p><p>Xiamang Zishan didn&#x2019;t even take a single step back, but Ning was actually forced backwards until his back slammed into the mountain wall behind him. The mountain peak, already trembling and unstable, suddenly began to collapse.</p><p>&#x201C;How can this be?!&#x201D; Ning&#x2019;s face was completely ashen. In his very first clash against Xiamang Zishan, he had already executed the [Starseizing Hand]. In the first exchange, he had barely managed to fight the man to a standstill, but now that this man had used an even more powerful technique, Ning was now in a position of absolute inferiority.</p><p>&#x201C;His staff techniques are more powerful than my sword techniques.&#x201D; Ning understood the issue. The difference between the two in terms of the Dao was too great. In addition, the enemy had reached the twelfth level of the [Crimsonbright Diagram of the Nine Heavens], which was more than Ning!</p><p>This opponent was of the imperial Xiamang clan. Although the divine abilities he trained in couldn&#x2019;t compare to Ning&#x2019;s [Starseizing Hand], they were still some of the better divine abilities of the Three Realms, and the difference wasn&#x2019;t too staggeringly great.</p><p>Rumble&#x2026;</p><p>The mountain peak collapsed, sending rocks flying everywhere.</p><p>Ji Ning and Xiamang Zishan stared at each other, completely ignoring the flying rubble. The flying rubble couldn&#x2019;t even strike them; as soon as they came near, the divine power covering their bodies would instantly smash them apart.</p><p>&#x201C;[Three Heads, Six Arms!]&#x201D; Ning&#x2019;s body suddenly swayed as two new heads and four new arms emerged.</p><p>&#x201C;Haha, me too!&#x201D; Xiamang Zishan&#x2019;s body swayed as well, and he too used the [Three Heads, Six Arms] technique. He was now wielding a total of three giant black metal staffs.</p><p>&#x201C;Come.&#x201D; Ning charged forward, displaying his Windwing Evasion, moving as unpredictably as a ghost as he moved to engage Xiamang Zishan.</p><p>Hahaha&#x2026;.&#x201D; Xiamang Zishan continued to fight him head-on, charging straight for him.</p><p>Both of them were using [Three Heads, Six Arms]! Six swords, fighting against three black metal staffs!</p><p>Sword-light flowed through the air like streams of running water, incomparably beautiful. A flood of staff-blows filled the skies like bolts of thunder. Ning no longer fought head on; in the past, when he relied on the [Starseizing Hand], he was able to brute-force everything, but upon meeting Xiamang Zishan&#x2026;he began to instead turn to using the nimbleness inherent to swords, as well as the Windwing Evasion technique. Although with each exchange of blows, Ning was knocked backwards, he wasn&#x2019;t sent completely flying like earlier.</p><p>&#x201C;I&#x2019;m going to hit! Hit! Hit hit hit you!!!&#x201D; Xiamang Zishan was incomparably berserk as his three black metal staffs wildly smashed everywhere.</p><p>Ning&#x2019;s six swords were like an unbroken, everflowing stream of water, blocking and shunting the power of the enemy attacks to the side each time. Every so often, he would even be able to deliver a counterblow with his sword as well.</p><p>However, Ning could taste the blood in his mouth. &#x201C;I can&#x2019;t continue like this. I have to rescue senior apprentice-sister.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;[Lesser Thousand Swords Formation]!&#x201D;</p><p>Swish! Swish! Swish!</p><p>Instantly, a golden sword coalesced before him, then howled through the air and shot towards Cangwu Jiu. Ning sent frantically, &#x201C;Senior apprentice-sister, hurry up and leave.&#x201D;</p><p>BANG! With a powerful staff blow, Xiamang Zishan smashed Ning down into the shattered stones. He roared angrily, &#x201C;Punk, don&#x2019;t get distracted. If you get distracted, you&#x2019;ll die!&#x201D;</p><p>&#x2026;&#x2026;</p><p>The fight between Xiamang Zishan and Ji Ning had long ago attracted the attention of almost everyone, from the Pure Yang True Immortals and Celestial Immortals to the people on the plaza below the Skylight Palace.</p><p>&#x201C;Xiamang Zishan and Cangwu Jiu. The Heavenly Treasures Mountain reported these two as number one and number two.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Ji Ning is so formidable; he was actually able to tie down Cangwu Jiu.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;He&#x2019;s now fighting against Xiamang Zishan.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Xiamang Zishan is so powerful. Ji Ning has actually been able to exchange more than a hundred rounds of attacks with him?&#x201D; The various delegates from the 3600 and 4 great seas all felt their hearts clench. Many of them were Loose Immortals or Earth Immortals; naturally, they could tell how formidable and fierce Xiamang Zishan&#x2019;s staff technique was.</p><p>This was a staff technique that surpassed the techniques of many Loose Immortals! In addition, Xiamang Zishan&#x2019;s divine body and divine abilities were clearly incredibly powerful as well. He was an absolutely dominating and irresistible force.</p><p>But Ji Ning, a young fellow who had only trained for thirty or so years, was actually able to withstand the attacks. Although he was in a position of inferiority, he was able to rely on the nimbleness of his sword arts to deflect the attacks, and tie down his opponent!</p><p>But upon seeing Ji Ning be distracted as he controlled the [Lesser Thousand Swords Formation] to tie down Cangwu Jiu, resulting in Xiamang Zishan heavily injuring him and sending him flying into the rubble, many people instantly felt their hearts clench for Ning.</p><p>&#x201C;Ji Ning is actually allowing himself to be distracted in a life-and-death battle? His opponent is Xiamang Zishan!&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;I hope he doesn&#x2019;t end up losing his own life for the sake of saving his female companion.&#x201D;</p><p>Many of the people in the plaza of the imperial citadel were discussing the situation amongst themselves.</p><p>Mu Northson, Little Qing, the Whitewater Hound, Immortal Fivecraze, Northmont Baiwei, and Ninelotus had begun to feel nervous and worried long ago. But there was nothing they could do; they couldn&#x2019;t go inside. No one could help Ji Ning. They could just watch as the scene played out before them.</p><p><br></p><hr><p><br></p><p><br></p><hr><p><br></p>
