<p>Shortly after Ji Ning entered secluded meditation, he received word that his master Patriarch Subhuti had returned to the Three Realms alongside Windfiend. The two were planning to break through to the Samsara Daolord level.</p><p>The Three Realms. Serpentwing Lake. Brightheart Island.</p><p>The black-robed Ning, Subhuti, and Windfiend were seated close to each other, drinking wine and chatting.</p><p>&#x201C;Brother Windfiend and I have spent hundreds of millions of years wandering the outside world. We have benefited greatly from our experiences and feel that it is time for us to break through to become Samsara Daolords,&#x201D; Subhuti said with a laugh.</p><p>&#x201C;Haha&#x2026; we&#x2019;ve wandered the Badlands Territory and even a number of the nearby territories. I don&#x2019;t want to brag, but it is quite hard for us to find any World-level cultivators who are our equals.&#x201D; Windfiend seemed quite smug as well.</p><p>&#x201C;Oh?&#x201D; Ning was surprised. &#x201C;Windfiend, Master&#x2026; can the two of you give me a demonstration and show me the level you have reached?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Very well.&#x201D; Windfiend smiled as a series of additional Windfiends began to appear in the area around them. Dozens of them appeared, all with different expressions and postures.</p><p>Seeing this, Ning nodded slowly. &#x201C;For you to have reached such a level in the Dao of Wind&#x2026; you must have mastered a Supreme Dao.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Now watch Master&#x2019;s abilities.&#x201D; Subhuti put down his wine cup. Instantly, spacetime in the surrounding area began to ripple. Space itself seemed to transform as though this area was severed from the rest of the universe, and the speed of time began to change as well. It was like the three of them were aboard a small vessel, with the outside world being a river of spacetime.</p><p>&#x201C;Given Master&#x2019;s mastery over the Dao of Spacetime, he probably mastered a Supreme Dao as well.&#x201D; Ning was rather stunned. It must be remembered that he had only left quite ordinary techniques to the Three Realms in the past. Those were all techniques he had acquired from Vastheaven Palace, and there was nothing particularly impressive. For example, there were no Hegemonic legacies! How was it that his master and Windfiend had both mastered a Supreme Dao each?</p><p>It must be remembered that Ning had only gained his Omega Sword Dao thanks to his experiences in Vastheaven Palace, in the Archaeus Region, and many other places. If it hadn&#x2019;t been for all of those things, he probably would be just slightly superior to Subhuti and Windfiend.</p><p>&#x201C;Master and Windfiend truly are monstrously talented,&#x201D; Ning sighed secretly in amazement. In truth, all of the Immortals and Fiendgods of the Three Realm were freakishly talented. Originally, they had no legacies at all&#x2026; but they had managed to develop their own incredible techniques. Three Purities, Tathagata, the Three Sovereigns of Mankind, Houyi, Subhuti&#x2026; they had all developed techniques that allowed them to fight those at a higher level, which meant that they vastly surpassed those on the same level in terms of insight into the Dao. Even the slightly weaker ones like Sun Wukong, Daoist Jade Cauldron, or Maitreya were still at a higher level of enlightenment than those in the outside world.</p><p>&#x201C;Windfiend, Master&#x2026; do not be in a rush to break through just yet,&#x201D; Ning said solemnly. &#x201C;I have just left a few truly top-tier techniques within the Three Realms Archives! Go and check them out first.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Truly top-tier techniques?&#x201D; Subhuti and Windfiend were both startled.</p><p>&#x201C;The techniques you gave us previously were already quite good.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Are there even better ones now?&#x201D; The two both looked at Ning. The two were incredibly talented, and as soon as they reached the World level they immediately reached a level of power where very few of their peers were able to defeat them. However, their experiences simply weren&#x2019;t as incredible as Ning&apos;s, nor did they have as many fortuitous encounters. Thankfully, Ning had gifted the Three Realms with many techniques; otherwise, their talents would&#x2019;ve gone to waste.</p><p>&#x201C;You&#x2019;ll know once you go take a look,&#x201D; Ning said with a laugh. He didn&#x2019;t explain in detail.</p><p>&#x201C;Alright.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;We&#x2019;ll go take a look first.&#x201D; Both of them were deeply intrigued by Ning&#x2019;s secretive attitude, and they both hurried over to the Three Realms Archives to take a look.</p><p>The new additions Ning had just added into the Three Realms Archives&#x2026; included the World-level parts of the Hegemonic legacies which Ning had gained!</p><p>Ning watched as his master Subhuti and Windfiend departed. His body flickered. Whoosh! He arrived in the void outside the Three Realms, where he stood by himself.</p><p>&#x201C;More and more, I&#x2019;m beginning to get the feeling that the Three Realms is an extraordinary place.&#x201D; Ning stared at the many spread-out planets in the Three Realms, including the three thousand major worlds and the trillions of minor worlds.</p><p>&#x201C;When I was out adventuring through the outside world, I began to understand how unique the Three Realms are&#x2026; but I didn&#x2019;t realize just how amazing it was. After a few hundred million years, though&#x2026; the Three Realms have completely changed,&#x201D; Ning sighed in amazement.</p><p>The Three Realms had undergone a gradual transformation, which was why Ning hadn&#x2019;t noticed anything at first. After hundreds of millions of years, however, the difference was quite drastic and apparent.</p><p>Many years ago the most dazzling figures of the earlier eras, such as Daoist Three Purities, the Three Sovereigns of Mankind, Lord Tathagata the Buddha, Houyi, and Demonheart had all perished in battle. The survivors who were on par with them, Subhuti and Windfiend, were now close to becoming Samsara Daolords&#x2026; and extraordinary ones at that!</p><p>As for the many elite figures like Sun Wukong, Buddha Maitreya, or Yang Jie? After hundreds of millions of years of cultivation, they had all broken through to the World level as well. Even Brightmoon had improved! Although she wasn&#x2019;t quite that talented, she had still been able to break through to become a Celestial Immortal thanks to her own efforts. Under Ning&#x2019;s guidance, she had actually reached the Elder God level.</p><p>What&#x2019;s more&#x2026; the success rates for Immortals and Fiendgods of the Three Realms breaking through to become Celestial Immortals was skyrocketing! Although some would fail and become Loose Immortals, many would reincarnate and eventually succeed in becoming Celestial Immortals. Only a small percentage were unlucky enough to actually perish to the Celestial Tribulation!</p><p>The change was all-encompassing. Celestial Immortals, True Immortals, Ancestral Immortals, Chaos Immortals&#x2026; after the Three Realms gained so many legacies, the breakthrough rates at every single level had skyrocketed.</p><p>&#x201C;Everyone in the Three Realms is much more talented than those in the outside world,&#x201D; Ning sighed. &#x201C;The same was true for the Seamless Chaosworld. The Immortals and Fiendgods from the Seamless Chaosworld were on par with that of the Pangu Chaosworld.&#x201D; Ning grew increasingly curious. &#x201C;What made them so special?&#x201D;</p><p>By now, Ning was definitely one of the major powers in the Endless Territories. He had reached the Archon level of power, and thus had a much broader vision than many. He knew that there were some chaosworlds, including the ones which Hegemons had labored over or ones like the Sithe worlds, which were quite special and which gave birth to living beings who were noticeably more talented than those in the rest of the world.</p><p>What made the Three Realms so special?</p><p>&#x201C;Perhaps it has something to do with the Azureflower Estate,&#x201D; Ning mused. He then shook his head and chuckled. Only with enough strength could one act with confidence. Only when he took the final step and became a Daolord of the Fourth Step would he have reached the apex. When that happened, in all the Flamedragon Realmverse the only ones more powerful than him would be the three Hegemons!</p><p>&#x2026;&#x2026;</p><p>Windfiend had been the Lord of All Fiends of the Three Realms, the supreme leader of the Seamless Gate. He was the fastest person in all the Three Realms.</p><p>Subhuti was a master of the Dao of Spacetime. His mastery of it had been supreme within the Three Realms.</p><p>These two were exceedingly talented figures. After studying the World-level parts of the Hegemonic legacies, they immediately began to seek to merge multiple Supreme Daos together!</p><p>After training for 120 million years (which translated into 10 billion &#x2018;accelerated&#x2019; years within his temporal acceleration treasure), Windfiend finally managed to merge three Supreme Daos together&#x2026; and he broke through to become a Samsara Daolord at one go!</p><p>Subhuti was a bit slower. He had to train for over 300 million years, also using a temporal acceleration treasure. Finally, he also succeeded in merging multiple Supreme Daos and became a Samsara Daolord.</p><p>But of course&#x2026; only the two of them reached such heights. The other Immortals and Fiendgods of the Three Realm were a bit weaker.</p><p>&#x201C;Windfiend, Master&#x2026; these legacies are critically important. I shall personally watch over these legacies, and anyone who wishes to study them must swear lifeblood oaths. If I perish, I will entrust them to you and Windfiend to watch over,&#x201D; Ning said solemnly. These were the copies of the hundreds of Hegemonic legacies, and his Primaltwin had spent an extremely long period of time memorizing them.</p><p>&#x201C;These legacies&#x2026;&#x201D; Subhuti and Windfiend were absolutely stunned by the enormous repository of legacies in front of them. These legacies were of limited use to Ning, who trained in the Omega Sword Dao, but they would be of tremendous use to all other cultivators. This was far more valuable than anything Ning had acquired in the Brightshore Kingdom or the Archaeus Region.</p><p>&#x201C;The existences of these legacies cannot be divulged in the slightest.&#x201D; Subhuti looked at Ning, his heart aching for his disciple. &#x201C;Disciple, don&#x2019;t put yourself under too much pressure when adventuring. Take things slowly, one step at a time. You&#x2019;ve already done enough for the Three Realms.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Darknorth, be careful when out adventuring. Subhuti and I are still too weak; the Three Realms needs you standing guard over it,&#x201D; Windfiend said. After seeing the legacies, he understood just how weak he was. He was still just a Daolord of the First Step; in the Endless Territories, he counted for absolutely nothing.</p><p>&#x2026;&#x2026;</p><p>All of Ning&#x2019;s loved ones were in the Three Realms. His father, Ji Yichuan&#x2026; his mother, Yuchi Snow&#x2026; his daughter, Ji Brightmoon&#x2026; Subhuti, Uncle White, Little Qing, Immortal Diancai, Mu Northson, Sun Wukong, and more were all here.</p><p>Although Ning was often adventuring with the hope of reversing the flows of spacetime and reviving his wife, he also cared tremendously about his other loved ones. Only if he could absolutely ensure their safety would he be able to truly lay rest to his concerns and go out adventuring!</p><p>&#x201C;Brightmoon.&#x201D; A black-robed Ning was standing on the surface of Serpentwing Lake.</p><p>&#x201C;Father.&#x201D; The white-robed Brightmoon was standing on the surface of the lake as well. Her life truly was relaxed and leisurely; with a peerless master of the Dao of the Sword like Ji Ning being her tutor and guide, everything was so simple. In fact, Ning even occasionally arranged for her to go out and explore the Badlands Territory. Given Ning&#x2019;s current level of power, a single step was all it took for them to reach the Badlands Territory.</p><p>&#x201C;Let me see if your sword-arts have improved or not,&#x201D; Ning said.</p><p>&#x201C;Yes, Father.&#x201D; Brightmoon smiled, followed by her sword-light lighting up. A total of 3600 Immortal swords hung in the air around her. This was a terrifyingly powerful sword-formation technique which Ning had passed down to her. For some reason, Brightmoon simply had no talent for training as a Fiendgod Body Refiner, and so she was focused on being a Ki Refiner.</p><p>Whooooosh. Sword-light covered the entire world.</p><p>Ning began to spar against his daughter. He had been at the side of his daughter and his parents for hundreds of millions of years now. He had always dreamed of having Yu Wei by their side one day as well, accompanying him and watching as he taught their daughter swordplay. If that day ever came, he truly would be able to die with no regrets.</p><p><br></p><hr><p><br></p>
