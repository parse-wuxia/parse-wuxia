<p>The giant yellow bear nodded lightly. &#x201C;Your chances are quite good. You can give it a try.&#x201D;</p><p>Ning smiled, then walked towards the corridor.</p><p>At every distinct level of power, Fiendgody Body Refiners would have just two chances to attempt to pass the Wargod Hall&#x2019;s trials. Thus, Ning would generally ask the giant yellow bear for his opinion. Each trial represented a supreme treasure, and so Ning didn&#x2019;t dare to be too reckless in taking them. This was especially true now, as they represented Immortal-ranked magic treasures!</p><p>A short while later.</p><p>Whoosh. Ning walked out from the Wargod Hall.</p><p>&#x201C;Success!&#x201D; Ning let out a soft breath. On the eighth floor of the Wargod Hall, he had encountered an ancient, Void-level Fiendgod! Ning&#x2019;s own [Crimsonbright Diagram of the Nine Heavens] was only at the fifteenth stage, and he was only comparable to an ordinary early-stage Void-level Fiendgod Body Refiner. If he was to be compared against real Fiendgods, he would probably only be equivalent to a peak Primal-level Fiendgod!</p><p>A Void-level Fiendgod was a full level higher than him in power! It also had its own divine abilities that allowed its might to increase even further!</p><p>This truly had been a bloody, hard-fought battle. In fact, the Void-level Fiendgod had even unleashed three powerful clones as he transformed his single body into three mighty Fiendgods which surrounded and assaulted Ning! Ning had used the [Three Heads, Six Arms] ability, the [Starseizing Hand], and had sent his sword-light flashing everywhere&#x2026;and in the end, he managed to seize the upper hand, then force the Fiendgod to admit defeat.</p><p>&#x201C;That was absolutely fantastic. After studying the Dao for thirty years here at Mount Innerheart, I finally defeated a Void-level Fiendgod!&#x201D; Ning thought back to the past, when he had roamed the wild marshes of the Gaol Mountains. Back then, he had been nothing but an ant in the eyes of that ancient, Void-level Fiendgod.</p><p>But now! He himself was on the same level of a Void-level Fiendgod! He was no weaker, and in fact, he had just defeated one!</p><p>&#x201C;Strange. Why would a Void-level Fiendgod have appeared within the underwater estate?&#x201D; Ning&#x2019;s heart was filled with questions. He had asked the spirit of the underwater estate, that giant yellow bear, about some of these questions, but the spirit refused to say.</p><p>&#x201C;Ji Ning, congratulations. You&#x2019;ve defeated the eighth level of the Wargod Hall.&#x201D; The giant yellow bear appeared out of nowhere. &#x201C;In the past, even Immortal Juhua himself was only able to overcome the seventh level.&#x201D;</p><p>Immortal Juhua, after becoming a Loose Immortal, had finally challenged and overcome the seventh level. A long, long time later, he became powerful enough to challenge and overcome the eighth level, but by then he no longer had any chances left to make the attempt!</p><p>&#x201C;Senior, I&#x2019;m going to choose a treasure now,&#x201D; Ning said with a laugh. &#x201C;Last time, when I overcame the seventh level, the book of treasures you brought out only included high-grade Immortal-ranked magic treasures; there wasn&#x2019;t a single top-grade Immortal-ranked magic treasure to be found.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;This time, there definitely will be,&#x201D; the giant yellow bear said. &#x201C;And during your third selection, the number of treasures will be even greater.&#x201D;</p><p>Ning felt resigned. This was in accordance with the rules of the Treasure Hall. In principle, one had three chances to acquire Immortal-ranked magic treasures! They would come when one challenged and overcame the seventh and eighth levels of the Wargod Hall, and when one reached the sixteenth level of the [Crimsonbright Diagram of the Nine Heavens] and entered a brand new and distinct level of power!</p><p>But the number of Immortal-ranked magic treasures available for the choosing during the first chance was quite limited.</p><p>The second choosing saw more choices.</p><p>As for the third&#x2026;all of the Immortal-ranked magic treasures which Daoist Threelives had left behind would be put on display. Naturally, many exquisite specimens would be made available then.</p><p>&#x201C;You know, it is a minor matter for you, as the controller of the Treasure Hall, to pull out those other treasures and let me choose from them, right?&#x201D; Ning felt resigned.</p><p>&#x201C;Can&#x2019;t do it.&#x201D; The giant yellow bear shook his head. &#x201C;Not even I can change the rules which Master left behind. In the past, it was because you had just entered the Wanxiang Adept level, the level at which a cultivator is most likely to perish, that Master&#x2019;s rules allowed for an exception to be made and for you to choose some protective treasures. As for now? You are sufficiently strong enough already; we must follow the rules now.&#x201D;</p><p>Ning nodded.</p><p>&#x2026;&#x2026;</p><p>Ning entered the Treasure Hall.</p><p>An amount of time equal to boiling a kettle of tea passed.</p><p>He left the Treasure Hall, another Immortal-ranked magic treasure in his hands!</p><p>&#x201C;Hahaha&#x2026;&#x201D; Ning laughed as he walked out of the Treasure Hall. He was indeed much happier with what he chose during this second choosing than he had been for the first.</p><p>&#x201C;Senior, I&#x2019;m going to go to the Still Room for a period of closed-door meditation,&#x201D; Ning said, then headed to the underwater estate&#x2019;s Still Room.</p><p>Rumble! The door to the Still Room swung open, then once more swung shut.</p><p>Ning sat down in the lotus position atop that enormous bed of netherwater jade. The inky-jade bed emanated an astonishing aura of coldness, causing even the soul to feel chilled! The very first time he had sat atop this bed of netherwater jade, Ning had felt as though his soul had been completely frozen. However, Ning was now far more powerful.</p><p>His insights into the Dao were at a high level. His Dao-heart was firmer. His soul was more powerful! Even the bed of netherwater jade was only able to make Ning feel extremely cool and relaxed.</p><p>Rumble&#x2026;</p><p>The Grand Bodhi Stillheart Formation began to emanate ripples of power.</p><p>Ning&#x2019;s heart turned completely calm. With a wave of his hand, Ning caused two treasures to appear and levitate before him. One treasure was a golden circlet! As for the other, it was a set of nine black Immortal swords that seemed to flutter in and out of existence in a transient manner.</p><p>The golden circlet was the item Ning had chosen when he had overcome the seventh level of the Wargod Hall. It was known as the Tripartite Immortal-Locking Circlet. It was a high-grade Immortal-ranked magic treasure that was meant to trap or restrain foes. Once a foe was caught by it, it would become very hard for the foe to escape, and in fact some weaker foes would be restrained and absorbed into the circlet itself. There was a stand-alone dimension within the circlet, and it could be used to collect living creatures or inanimate objects. Upon being trapped within it, even the likes of a Pure Yang True Immortal would be unable to depart from it.</p><p>But of course, Pure Yang True Immortals wouldn&#x2019;t be so stupid as to just stand there and allow it to draw them in!</p><p>As for the nine black Immortal swords, they were the set of Immortal-ranked magic treasures which Ning had just chosen after having overcome the eighth level of the Wargod Hall. They were known as the Heavenraker Swords. All nine of them were top-grade Immortal-ranked flying swords. These nine swords&#x2026;although they were individually still inferior to the Thousandbull Sword, which had reached the very peak of top-grade Immortal-ranked magic items and was almost comparable to a Pure Yang Immortal sword in power, there were nine of these Heavenraker Swords! Taken as a whole, they were not weaker than the Thousandbull Sword at all!</p><p>Most importantly of all, Ning had once seen a sword-arts secret manual on the ninth floor of the Divinities Palace which was known as [Heavenraker].</p><p>Ning had previously asked the giant yellow bear, &#x201C;Senior, on the ninth floor of the Divinities Palace, I saw a sword-arts manual titled [Heavenraker]. The abridged version stated that this technique was a sword-art created by a major power of the Three Realms known as Daofather Heavenrake. Might I ask if there is a connection between the Heavenraker Swords and Daofather Heavenrake?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Hahaha, this set of Heavenraker Swords were specially designed to be used to execute the Heavenraker sword technique! The Heavenraker sword technique was already tremendously famous back in the Primordial World of Pangu, and is still an extremely famous sword-art in the current Three Realms!&#x201D; The giant yellow bear had said with a laugh.</p><p>And so, Ning had immediately chosen this set of swords!</p><p>&#x2026;&#x2026;</p><p>Ning sat there atop the netherwater jade bed, staring at the two mighty Immortal-ranked magic treasures before him. He nodded gently. &#x201C;After I defeat the ninth golem, I&#x2019;ll immediately go to the ninth floor of the Divinities Palace and choose the [Heavenraker] sword technique.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;In the future, I will need to slowly perfect the [Three-Foot Sword] by absorbing many of the best points from other techniques. As for [Heavenraker]&#x2026;if things are as I suspect, it will become yet another technique that I can use to defeat my foes.</p><p>The sword-arts which Immortal Northwalker had created was&#x2026;more than a bit lacking compared to some of the powerful sword-arts contained within the Divinities Palace.</p><p>Ning had already completely overhauled and perfected the first eight stances! As for the ninth stance, he had improved and perfected it. He himself would have to go create a tenth stance and an eleventh stance for this technique.</p><p>The sword-arts which Ning himself created would be the sword-arts that were best suited to him, and which would be the most powerful in his hands!</p><p>However, before he actually created his own sword-arts, the [Heavenraker] technique could be used for a period of time.</p><p>&#x201C;This Tripartite Immortal-Locking Circlet&#x2026;after Uncle White becomes a Void-level Earth Immortal, I&#x2019;ll give it to him,&#x201D; Ning murmured to himself. This circlet wasn&#x2019;t of great use to him, and when he had chosen it, it was with the intention of giving it to Uncle White. Uncle White was a grandmaster of formations, but he was lacking in attacking techniques. This Tripartite Immortal-Locking Circlet could transform into the tripartite powers of Heaven, Earth, and Man. It was incredibly difficult to use, but it was very well-suited for Uncle White, who was a grandmaster of formations. It didn&#x2019;t even require Uncle White to go fight in close combat. It was indeed quite well suited for him!</p><p>&#x2026;&#x2026;</p><p>This closed-door session lasted for more than a month. Ning completely and thoroughly overhauled this ninth stance of the [Three-Foot Sword], &#x2018;Sword Roaming the Three Realms&#x2019;, making it more reserved and stately while also making it even more ferocious and fast!</p><p>For Immortal Northwalker, the ninth stance of &#x2018;Sword Roaming the Three Realms&#x2019; represented the pinnacle, but for Ji Ning, the ninth stance was just a midway point; he was definitely going to go create a tenth and an eleventh stance.</p><p>&#x201C;It&#x2019;s already summer?&#x201D; When Ning walked out of his Immortal estate he saw the sun hanging high in the sky, blazing with incomparable heat.</p><p>Every single world was illuminated by the Solar Star and the Lunar Star.</p><p>This was even true for the estate-world of the Tristar Crescent Abode. Every single world would see the projections of the Solar Star and the Lunar Star. For example, within the world of the Grand Xia, there was also a Solar Star and a Lunar Star! Because the Solar Star was a bit closer to the world of the Grand Xia, in that world, the Solar Star was a bit larger while the Lunar Star appeared a bit smaller.</p><p>Although they were only &#x2018;projections&#x2019; of the Solar Star and the Lunar Star, they still possessed utterly terrifying power. Clearly, the power of these two stars, the most supreme and exalted of celestial bodies, was utterly inconceivable.</p><p>&#x201C;Uncle-master.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Patriarch.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Patriarch.&#x201D;</p><p>Many disciples of Mount Innerheart were currently congregated outside the Divinities Palace. Some were quietly training in the Dao, others were discussing it, and still others were relaxing. Upon seeing Ning arrive, they all hurriedly rose to their feet and called out with respect.</p><p>During the course of these thirty years, these disciples of Mount Innerheart now felt true esteem for Ji Ning, an admiration which came from the depths of their heart!</p><p>&#x201C;Mm.&#x201D; Ning just nodded lightly, then stepped into the Divinities Palace. He started from the first floor and walked all the way to the ninth.</p><p>On the staircase to the side of the ninth floor, the white-robed Silvermoon was seated, leaning against the banister. There was some Immortal wine, roasted goose, and other roasted meat next to him. His feather-fan was covering his stomach as he just lay there napping.</p><p>Ning was in no hurry. He first walked to a nearby bookshelf, then picked out the sword-arts manual titled [Heavenraker].</p><p>The secret manuals located here on the ninth floor were all extraordinary.</p><p>Ning flipped through the abridged version, then nodded gently, revealing a hint of a smile. [Heavenraker] was indeed created by Daofather Heavenrake of the Three Realms. It required nine Immortal-ranked flying swords to be used, and ideally the nine swords would all be infused with the 36-Layered Heavenrake Sword Formation.</p><p>&#x201C;This [Heavenraker]&#x2026;it uses the profound mysteries of the elements of Water and Earth, has also been infused with the secrets of the Grand Dao of Qiankun, and is unleashed through the Grand Dao of the Sword.&#x201D; Ning nodded to himself. He was quite skilled in Water, Qiankun, and the Sword. As for Earth&#x2026;Daofather Heavenrake had clearly prepared some more elementary sword techniques amongst the many sword techniques.</p><p>Although Ning had few to no insights regarding the element of Earth, he could still use those sword-arts that didn&#x2019;t include the Earth-element. In the future, he would probably advance in Earth as well as a result.</p><p>&#x201C;Senior apprentice-brother, senior apprentice-brother.&#x201D; Ning put down the abridged version, then walked next to Silvermoon and called out to him. In fact, he even gave him a little push. &#x201C;Senior apprentice-brother!&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Huh?&#x201D; Only now did Silvermoon open his eyes. &#x201C;What, what is it?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Senior apprentice-brother, I want to challenge the ninth golem,&#x201D; Ning said.</p><p><br></p><hr><p><br></p>
