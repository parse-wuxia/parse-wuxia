<p>&#x201C;The Flamedragon branch of the Aeonian race will generally send people once every million chaos cycles to harvest some fruit from this omnigeddon bloodfruit tree.&#x201D; The sea dragon leader&#x2019;s voice was quite calm: &#x201C;That&#x2019;s because every million chaos cycles, this omnigeddon bloodfruit tree will be filled with a complete harvest of fruit. They&#x2019;ll either send their own Daolords or ask some extremely powerful Daolords to help out.&#x201D;</p><p>Ji Ning and Ninedust both nodded. Generally speaking, every two or three &#x2018;eras&#x2019; there would be a Daolord on par with the current Ning. Some would have techniques like the [Heartsword] art, some would have Universe treasures, some would have other special weapons. Daolord Dreamlore, for example, had a very unique &#x2018;bloodblade&#x2019;, while Ning had an incredibly powerful Hegemon armor which was on par with the bloodblade in might. However, the Hegemon armor was obviously meant for defense. Another good example would be the six lifeblood weapons which Ning wielded; all of them had been raised to incredibly high levels.</p><p>Powerful Eternal Emperors lived extremely long lives and generally were able to raise their lifeblood weapons to extremely high levels, but Daolords had short lives. It was generally very hard for them to upgrade their lifeblood weapons significantly&#x2026; but every so often, there would be a freak like Ning. Ning&#x2019;s Northbow swords were incredibly powerful weapons; by now, they made his Heavenbreaker stance and Blood Drop stance five times more powerful than normal! If the Daolord himself was also quite powerful, it was entirely possible for the Daolord to reach the same level as the Archons of the eight Sacred Cities.</p><p>&#x201C;If my guess is correct&#x2026; you weren&#x2019;t invited here by the Aeonians, were you?&#x201D; The sea dragon leader smiled.</p><p>&#x201C;What?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;They weren&#x2019;t invited by the Aeonians?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;How is this possible?&#x201D; Quite a few of the airborne beasts were astonished. Most of them had assumed that Ning and Ninedust had to have been invited here by the Aeonians.</p><p>Ning and Ninedust felt their hearts lurch.</p><p>&#x201C;From the moment you arrived,&#x201D; the flaming equine leader added, &#x201C;I could tell that you know almost nothing about this place. If the Aeonians invited you here, you should be quite familiar with this place and its rules&#x2026; but you didn&#x2019;t even know the basics about the trials and its rules.&#x201D;</p><p>Ning and Ninedust felt resigned. They really didn&#x2019;t know anything about this place. Ninedust sent mentally, &#x201C;Darknorth, if these beasts attack us I&#x2019;ll lead you in an immediate escape.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Don&#x2019;t worry, you two. We&#x2019;re here on the Autarch&#x2019;s orders to protect this place and will bar any Daolords or Emperors who seek to approach,&#x201D; the sea dragon leader said with a laugh. &#x201C;We won&#x2019;t stop any who pass our trials. Whether you are an Aeonian or not is none of our business.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Don&#x2019;t worry, if we wanted to kill you, we would&#x2019;ve done so long ago.&#x201D; The flaming equine leader could also tell that Ning and Ninedust both had misgivings.</p><p>&#x2026;&#x2026;</p><p>Ning and Ninedust were confident in their abilities. They were carrying the treasures they had acquired from the Sithe ruins, and they had the Autarch&#x2019;s medallion on them; their chances of fleeing were quite good.</p><p>&#x201C;As juniors, we naturally will believe your words, seniors. Dare I ask&#x2026; is that fruit tree over there truly an omnigeddon bloodfruit tree?&#x201D; Ning asked.</p><p>&#x201C;Of course it is,&#x201D; the flaming equine leader said.</p><p>&#x201C;But&#x2026; why does it seem different from the ones I&#x2019;m aware of?&#x201D; Ning was puzzled. &#x201C;I&#x2019;ve heard that omnigeddon bloodfruit trees are much smaller and only have three fruits at most.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;This omnigeddon bloodfruit tree is a hundred times more precious than ordinary ones,&#x201D; the flaming equine leader said. &#x201C;Every single fruit is also far more marvelous than the ones from ordinary trees in the outside world. Haha&#x2026; words don&#x2019;t suffice. Once you harvest the fruit and give it a close examination, you will understand.&#x201D;</p><p>Ning and Ninedust were speechless. Moments later, Ning grew excited. A hundred times as valuable? A single true omnigeddon bloodfruit tree was a priceless treasure that even Hegemons would go crazy over! Something a hundred times more valuable&#x2026; Ning estimated that it had to approach the value of Crimsonwave Temple in worth. Even if it wasn&#x2019;t quite that much, it wouldn&#x2019;t be too far off.</p><p>&#x201C;This tree is probably worth more than the networth of most Hegemons, right?&#x201D; Ning couldn&#x2019;t help but ask.</p><p>&#x201C;Of course! The Aeonian race in the Flamedragon Realmverse treat this fruit tree as something more valuable than their very lives,&#x201D; the flaming equine leader said.</p><p>Ning immediately came to the decision that he not only was going to harvest the fruit, he was going to uproot this tree! He was going to uproot this mysterious, unique omnigeddon bloodfruit tree and take it away with him at all costs! This mysterious tree might be enough to ask an Autarch to revive his wife. His goal was within his sight; there was no way he wasn&#x2019;t going to give it his all.</p><p>&#x201C;Darknorth, are you thinking of uprooting the tree to save your Dao-companion?&#x201D; Ninedust sent mentally.</p><p>The fact that Ning wished to rescue his lover wasn&#x2019;t exactly a secret. When Ning had met the leaders of the six major organizations after exiting Crimsonwave Temple, he had already asked about the price needed to reverse the flows of spacetime and revive his beloved Dao-companion. Ninedust had been present and had heard everything.</p><p>&#x201C;Yes. This omnigeddon bloodfruit tree sounds as though it is quite valuable; I should be able to use it to ask an Autarch to help out! I have to take this risk!&#x201D; Ning sent mentally, &#x201C;Let&#x2019;s keep this a secret for now. If I mention taking the tree away, these two races might move to stop us. I&#x2019;m planning on uprooting it at the very end. After doing so, we&#x2019;ll leave right away.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Alright, I&#x2019;ll listen to you!&#x201D; Ninedust felt happy for his friend. The omnigeddon bloodfruit tree might be quite valuable, but Ninedust really didn&#x2019;t care that much about it.</p><p>&#x2026;&#x2026;</p><p>Ning and Ninedust began to walk towards the tree. The two clan leaders led the way in front of them, with the sea dragon leader rumbling, &#x201C;We won&#x2019;t move to stop Daolord Darknorth, but Daolord Ninedust, you haven&#x2019;t passed our trials yet. We&#x2019;ll only permit you to stand next to him and watch. You are forbidden from taking part, much less harvesting any of the fruit. If you dare to do so, don&#x2019;t blame us from moving to exterminate you.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;I understand,&#x201D; Ninedust acknowledged. In his heart, he felt quite resigned&#x2026; because his title was Daolord Redwater, not Daolord Ninedust! Alas, he didn&#x2019;t want to argue over it. They were going to leave soon and most likely would never meet again. Why even bother?</p><p>Soon, Ning and Ninedust arrived before the omnigeddon bloodfruit tree. &#x201C;Whoah.&#x201D; Both of them felt quite stunned. The entire tree had to be over three million meters high, and its trunk was as thick as the pillars of heaven. As for its twisted branches, they were like sinuous dragons that were covered with glowing, vitality-filled leaves. And the fruits? It must be understood that the two of them were able to sense the rippling auras of the fruits from far away. Now that they were much closer, those ripples surged straight into their hearts and minds. Even their breathing was affected by it.</p><p>&#x201C;What a fine treasure,&#x201D; Ning said with a praiseful sigh.</p><p>&#x201C;This is far more stunning than the fruit trees we saw in Crimsonwave Temple.&#x201D; Ninedust sighed in amazement as well. The feeling this mysterious fruit tree gave him surpassed even the majestic aura of Hegemons!</p><p>&#x201C;Only by combining all of those trees would you have something which surpassed this one. Of course it is stunning!&#x201D; Ning&#x2019;s heart was surging with excitement.</p><p>The nearby sea dragon leader said, &#x201C;The Aeonians have set up many layers of barriers around this tree. Do you have a technique to open those barriers up?&#x201D;</p><p>Ning and Ninedust were startled. Ning waved his hand, sending a wave of Immortal energy out and causing the formerly invisible and hidden barriers to immediately light up. Countless runes flowed on the surfaces of those barriers, causing Ning&#x2019;s face to tighten. They weren&#x2019;t invited here by the Aeonians; they naturally had no method for opening it up.</p><p>&#x201C;But they don&#x2019;t seem to be too strong,&#x201D; Ning suddenly realized with surprise. Based on what he just saw, he should be able to destroy these barriers within a short period of time with his sword-arts.</p><p>&#x201C;Of course they aren&#x2019;t. Only Daolords have come here, and so these were personally set up by the Daolords who did make it inside,&#x201D; the sea dragon leader said. &#x201C;They brought many formations and barriers, but unfortunately they are on automatic mode. No one is actively managing them, which weakens them even further.&#x201D;</p><p>Both Ning and Ninedust nodded. Formations which were actively controlled would be far more powerful. Without a controller present, they would be set to automatic and would thus naturally be much weaker.</p><p>There was nothing the Aeonians could do. Were they supposed to send Daolords to guard this place? Daolords only lived for 108,000 chaos cycles at most! Send Emperors? Eternal Emperors had zero chance of passing the trials.</p><p>&#x201C;Although they aren&#x2019;t all that strong, there are quite a number of them. Based on what I know, the Aeonians have set up a total of over 80,000 formations here,&#x201D; the sea dragon leader said. &#x201C;If you know the technique for unlocking the barriers, you can go through with ease. If not, you&#x2019;ll have to break through all 80,000+ barriers before you can move next to the omnigeddon bloodfruit tree.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;If you can&#x2019;t break through the formations, you won&#x2019;t be able to harvest so much as a single fruit,&#x201D; the flaming equine leader said with a laugh.</p><p>Both the clan leaders smiled as they looked at Ning. They wanted to see just what this young fellow would do.</p><p>&#x201C;More than 80,000?&#x201D; Ning&#x2019;s face tightened. Just now, he was able to sense that the outermost formation was quite weak. He would probably be able to destroy it with his sword-arts, but&#x2026; 80,000? How long would that take? If some of the inner barriers were tougher, things would be even more difficult.</p><p><br></p><hr><p><br></p>
