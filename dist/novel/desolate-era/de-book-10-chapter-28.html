<p>Within the Immortal estate.</p><p>The clan commanded by Immortal Witchsui, along with the many Seawave Dao-soldiers commanded by Immortal Duohe, continued to wait on the outside of the fifth palace. Although they were enraged and despairing, they still hoped&#x2026;hoped that a miracle might occur.</p><p>&#x201C;Monster clans.&#x201D; Suddenly, a voice rang out, and along with it, waves of divine will rolled out, instantly encompassing all of the monstrous Dao-soldiers.</p><p>&#x201C;Eh?&#x201D; All of the monsters looked over. Even Immortal Witchsui and Immortal Duohe were shocked.</p><p>A few hundred kilometers away, there was a fur-clad youth, with a little azure serpent coiled around his arm and a large, snowy white dog by his side. In the air around them hovered ancient, plain, unadorned wooden sticks. It was the Fuxi Staff Formation; space within a hundred kilometers of that human was completely locked, and there would be no way to teleport inside.</p><p>&#x201C;You?&#x201D; Immortal Witchsui and Immortal Duohe immediately recognized him. Amongst the group of humans, there was indeed a fur-clad human who had a giant snowy white dog.</p><p>&#x201C;The key to the Immortal estate is now in my hands.&#x201D; Ning&#x2019;s voice rang out by the ears of every single monster. His divine sense had spread to a thousand kilometers; naturally, he was able to send his voice to each and every one of them.</p><p>&#x201C;Open.&#x201D;</p><p>Ning held the key to the Immortal estate in his hands. He sent his will forth, and next to him a corridor appeared; it was the corridor to the Skyrove Mountains in the outside world. Actually, just now, Ning had already used the key to leave and go to the Skyrove Mountains, then re-entered, having Little Qing lead him and Uncle White in a teleportation. Little Qing was actually far more powerful now than she had been in the wild marshes of the Gaol Mountains; for near-distance blinks, she could bring others along with her. The main thing was that Ning had yet to bind the various branches; if he emerged directly from within the Witchriver Palace, he would have been surrounded by the monsters.</p><p>&#x201C;The key to the Immortal estate.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;He is holding the key to the Immortal estate in his hands.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;That&#x2019;s the outside world, the smell of the outside world.&#x201D; Immortal Witchsui and Immortal Duohe swept forward with their divine senses, and were even able to extend them into the corridor leading to the outside world. &#x201C;That&#x2019;s another world!&#x201D;</p><p>Immortal Witchsui, Immortal Duohe, and the many monsters all stared towards Ning with even more blazingly desirous gazes. Although they were suspicious as to why the other human was no longer holding the key, the truth remained that this man before them was holding it now. They couldn&#x2019;t be bothered to over-analyze it; they knew that the appearance of this youth represented a desire by this youth to negotiate with them.</p><p>Immortal Witchsui and Immortal Duohe were actually considering whether or not they should try to seize the key to the Immortal estate. However, their earlier, repeated failures caused them to no longer dare to act rashly.</p><p>&#x201C;Don&#x2019;t try anything. I&#x2019;ve already set up a formation around me, and the corridor is already open; I can leave at any time. In addition, even if you truly were to attack, you wouldn&#x2019;t be able to kill me,&#x201D; Ning said. He had that other protective magic treasure, and also the magic treasures which Youngflame Nong had left behind. His words were completely true.</p><p>Immortal Witchsui and Immortal Duohe, as well as the other monsters, all calmed down. They no longer dared to make any more gambles.</p><p>&#x201C;What do you want?&#x201D; Immotal Witchsui asked.</p><p>&#x201C;I offended a powerful a tribe, the Youngflame clan, and the clan is going to come act against me. They might even act against my tribe.&#x201D; Ning&#x2019;s divine sense was sending a message to every single monster. &#x201C;My tribe is located in a commandery city of the Grand Xia Dynasty, the City of Ten Thousand Swords. I wish for you, the monsters of this Immortal estate world, to go to the City of Ten Thousand Swords and protect my tribe. Protect them for a thousand years; after that period of time, I&#x2019;ll release you and give you your freedom. As for the key to the Immortal estate? I can just give it to you.&#x201D;</p><p>The key to the Immortal estate wasn&#x2019;t of much use to Ning. There was no way he could carry the Witchriver Immortal Estate with him; what was he supposed to do with it? In addition, he had the underwater estate, an even finer estate left behind by Daoist Threelives. As for the treasures within the Witchriver Immortal Estate? The Dao Repository and the Treasure Vault had already been looted clean.</p><p>&#x201C;Protect them for a thousand years?&#x201D; Immortal Witchsui and Immortal Duohe, along with the tens of thousands of monsters, were both amazed and delighted.</p><p>Although a thousand years was a fairly long period of time, monsters had extremely long lifespans to begin with. To simply protect a tribe for a thousand years&#x2026;they would then be able to go to the wider, vast world. They would even receive the key to the Immortal estate. They didn&#x2019;t even dare to imagine something like this previously. They had been preparing to be fleeced, and had even been willing to hand over part of their Dao-armors as their offer for peace.</p><p>But Ning had no desire for the Dao-armors; wearing the Dao-armors, these monsters would be ten times or even tens of times more powerful. That was what he wanted; them to be powerful!</p><p>&#x201C;Your tribe is located in the &#x2018;City of Ten Thousand Swords&#x2019; of the Grand Xia Dynasty? Based on what I know, the Grand Xia Dynasty is extremely strict in its prohibition against battles within commandery cities. If anyone dares to fight within one, they will suffer pursuit and apprehension by the Grand Xia Dynasty. This &#x2018;Youngflame&#x2019; clan that wishes to act against your tribe, they shouldn&#x2019;t dare to actually attack your city, should they?&#x201D; Immortal Duohe asked.</p><p>Although they had always been trapped within here, they had passed down records regarding the Grand Xia Dynasty&#x2019;s world from generation to generation, and so they knew some of the most basic things.</p><p>&#x201C;Correct, they won&#x2019;t dare to launch an actual attack. However, if they were to send some wanted criminals or some Deathsworn to attack my tribe&#x2026;&#x201D; Ning sent to them, &#x201C;These criminals and Deathsworn would most likely be at the Wanxiang level or the Primal Daoist level. Loose Immortals? The chances of there being one of them should be very, very low. Celestial Immortals? That&#x2019;s even less likely.&#x201D;</p><p>To enter a commandery city of the Grand Xia Dynasty and launch an attack was a challenge and affront to the entire Dynasty. Anyone who did so would be killed without question.</p><p>For the sake of Youngflame Nong, who was already dead&#x2026;would they really be willing to sacrifice a Loose Immortal, just for the sake of giving vent to their rage and killing a backwater tribe? The chances were quite low. As for sacrificing a Celestial Immortal? That was virtually impossible.</p><p>It must be understood that every single Celestial Immortal was considered one of the true foundations for a clan. A single word from a Celestial Immortal could even cause the clan leader to be changed.</p><p>If Ning were to become a Celestial Immortal, he would become one of the figures capable of influencing the entire Grand Xia Dynasty; even the entire Youngflame clan would treat him with courtesy. If it had been a Celestial Immortal who had killed Youngflame Nong, most likely the Youngflame clan would just go negotiate with him, rather than pursue and attack him. Thus, there was no way the Youngflame clan would be so stupid as to send a Celestial Immortal into a commandery city and begin a slaughter.</p><p>&#x201C;We know a little bit about the Grand Xia Empire&#x2019;s world. It is already incredible for the supreme clans to have even just one or two Celestial Immortals; there is no way they would let them end up as wanted criminals.&#x201D; Immortal Duohe and Witchsui exchanged a glance, then made up their minds.</p><p>&#x201C;We have decided to agree to your request. For a thousand years, we shall be stationed at that commandery city of the Grand Xia Empire, the &#x2018;City of Ten Thousand Swords&#x2019;, and protect your clan. Given our power, even if supreme Loose Immortals come, we should be able to easily defeat them. However, if a Celestial Immortal comes, there is nothing we can do.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;If a Celestial Immortal attacks, I&#x2019;ll just accept it,&#x201D; Ning sent. &#x201C;Monsters, all of you need to now swear an oath to the Dao of the Heavens. I shall do the same.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Fine.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;That&#x2019;s how it should be done.&#x201D;</p><p>The monsters were indeed afraid that Ning would later go back on his word; it was best if they all swore oaths to the Dao of the Heavens.</p><p>Soon, with Ning personally choosing the words to the oaths, both came to an agreement on what to say, then swore the oaths.</p><p>Tens of thousands of monsters simultaneously swore an oath to the Dao of the Heavens. Ripples of power from the Dao of the Heavens descended upon them, and through his divine sense, Ning could clearly see every single monster making the oath. These thirty thousand-plus monsters were the elites of this entire Immortal estate world; more than ninety nine percent of the Diremonster Immortal cultivators were present.</p><p>Oaths to the Dao of the Heavens were useless against mortals and useless against ordinary monsters, but upon monsters or humans embarking upon the Immortal path, it would have tremendous effect! These monstrous Dao-soldiers were all at the Zifu level at the very least. The thirty thousand-plus monsters, along with two Loose Immortals, all swore their oaths to the Dao of the Heavens, and Ning, in turn, was no longer worried about them going back on their word.</p><p>Naturally, he swore an oath as well.</p><p>&#x201C;There is no time to waste,&#x201D; Ning sent mentally. &#x201C;That expert from the Youngflame clan might even be a Celestial Immortal, and he will soon reach the Witchriver Immortal Estate. Once he comes, he might annihilate all of you. We need to immediately leave.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;What?!&#x201D; Immortal Witchsui, Immortal Duohe, and the others were all shocked.</p><p>The two Immortals were quite decisive; in the face of an opportunity that would change the destinies of all the monsters in the Immortal estate world, they immediately ordered the necessary arrangements be made. &#x201C;Daoist Zhenbao, Daoist Witchaxle, each of you go lead a thousand Dao-soldiers and gather all of our clansmen within the Immortal estate world, then lead them to the City of Ten Thousand Swords.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;This is a map of the Stillwater Commandery of the Grand Xia Empire. There is a mark here for the City of Ten Thousand Swords.&#x201D; Ning flew over as well. Given that they had all sworn oaths to the Dao of the Heavens, they were naturally now in the same boat.</p><p>&#x201C;We&#x2019;ll lead these soldiers to head there right away,&#x201D; Immortal Witchsui and Immortal Duohe both said. &#x201C;Everyone, get in.&#x201D; The two Immortals each produced a giant sack.</p><p>Whooooooosh.</p><p>Not a single one of the many monstrous Dao-soldiers resisted. All of them allowed themselves to be drawn into the sacks, leaving behind just Immortal Zhenbao, Immortal Witchaxle, and the two thousand Dao-soldiers under their command.</p><p>&#x201C;Let&#x2019;s go.&#x201D;</p><p>Whoosh. A corridor appeared, leading to the Skyrove Mountains.</p><p>Ning, Immortal Witchsui, Immortal Duohe, and Daoist Witchaxle all flew out.</p><p>They appeared within the gorge in the Skyrove Mountains. Even the aura and the smell here was different compared to the Immortal estate world; this was an aura of a vast, endless world, the smell of an entire, major world.</p><p>&#x201C;It&#x2019;s different.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;It really is different.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;This is the Grand Xia Dynasty&#x2019;s world.&#x201D; Immortal Witchsui, Immortal Duohe, and the others were all stunned and excited.</p><p>&#x201C;This is the key to the Immortal estate.&#x201D; Ning handed the key directly to Daoist Witchaxle. &#x201C;I&#x2019;m giving it to you now. Immediately lead the remaining monsters to quickly depart from the Immortal estate world; if you delay, the situation might change.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Right.&#x201D; Daoist Witchaxle accepted the key, then immediately generated a corridor, returning to the Immortal estate and then shutting the corridor off.</p><p>&#x201C;Let&#x2019;s go,&#x201D; Ning said. &#x201C;The City of Ten Thousand Swords is six hundred thousand kilometers to the north.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Let&#x2019;s go.&#x201D;</p><p>Immortal Duohe, that powerful old fellow, personally executed a teleportation, bringing Immortal Witchsui, Ning, Little Qing, and Uncle White with him in a long-distance teleport.</p><p>&#x2026;&#x2026;</p><p>Whoosh.</p><p>Ning realized that the surrounding environment had changed. He took a careful look, then said, &#x201C;We were slightly off; the City of Ten Thousand Swords is roughly twenty six thousand kilometers to our southeast.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Then I&#x2019;ll just teleport us again.&#x201D; The shorter the distance, the easier a teleportation was. Immortal Duohe easily teleported them a short distance.</p><p>In the middle of the air, surrounded by clouds, at a location just a few hundred kilometers outside the City of Ten Thousand Swords. A spatial ripple appeared, then from within it emerged Immortal Duohe, Immortal Witchsui, and a fur-clad youth, a little azure serpent, and a large, snowy white hound.</p><p>&#x201C;Here we are.&#x201D; Ning stared towards the distance. His Fiendgod-like eyesight could easily see the distant commandery city, just a few hundred kilometers away. This caused Ning to let out a sigh of relief; previously, when he had been chatting with the monsters in the Immortal estate, he had done so through divine sense, so as to save as much time as possible. He had been worried about taking too much time and unforseen things happening.</p><p>Ning pointed towards the distant commandery city. &#x201C;That city is the City of Ten Thousand Swords, the city which the monster clans of the Immortal estate must protect for a thousand years.&#x201D;</p><p><br></p><hr><p><br></p>
