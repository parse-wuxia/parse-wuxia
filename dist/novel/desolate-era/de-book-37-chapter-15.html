<p>Within the realmship, located inside one of the flaming passageways inside the Jadefire Realm. Ji Ning was seated inside the realmship, drinking some wine. The fragrance of the wine filled the entire vessel, while the Protector stood solemnly by his side.</p><p>&#x201C;Whitethaw, sit down and have some wine?&#x201D; Ning said with a relaxed smile.</p><p>&#x201C;I&#x2019;m a golem. I don&#x2019;t need to drink wine,&#x201D; Whitethaw said flatly.</p><p>Ning shook his head. &#x201C;That&#x2019;s where you are wrong. I don&#x2019;t &#x2018;need&#x2019; to drink wine either, but I still &#x2018;like&#x2019; to drink wine. We still need to have hobbies, you know. Come, come! I have plenty of precious wine stored up. Have a taste of all of them.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;No need.&#x201D; Whitethaw continued to stand there by himself.</p><p>&#x201C;I order you to sit down.&#x201D; Ning frowned.</p><p>&#x201C;Yes, Master.&#x201D; Whitethaw sat down obediently.</p><p>&#x201C;Drink.&#x201D; Ning pointed at the wine goblet in front of him.</p><p>Whitethaw picked up the goblet and dutifully drank the wine, then frowned and said in a low voice, &#x201C;I don&#x2019;t like it. I tried it back when I followed my previous master, &#x2018;Daoist Bluestone&#x2019;. I didn&#x2019;t like it then, I don&#x2019;t like it now.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Eh?!&#x201D; Ning was truly surprised. He waved his hand, causing a hundred different wine goblets to appear before him as well as more than a hundred gourds of wine. Wine flew out from each gourd, filling each one of the goblets.</p><p>&#x201C;Try them all. I refuse to believe this. Your body should&#x2019;ve been constructed perfectly, including your senses. How could you have no taste for wine whatsoever? I wager Daoist Bluestone just didn&#x2019;t let you try enough types, which is why you didn&#x2019;t run into anything you like,&#x201D; Ning said. &#x201C;Drink them all up, one cup at a time.&#x201D;</p><p>Whitethaw dutifully picked up one goblet after another, draining them in succession. A look of bewildered resignation was on his straightforward face. Why was this master of his forcing him to drink wine?</p><p>&#x201C;All done.&#x201D; Whitethaw quickly finished all of the wine. He remained quite calm.</p><p>&#x201C;Again.&#x201D; Ning refused to believe this. Cultivators drank wine when they had nothing better to do, and so Ning had plenty of wine on him at all times. He had acquired large reserves and stockpiles from the Daolords and Eternal Emperors he had defeated as well.</p><p>Whoosh. Whoosh. Whoosh. Ning continued to pour, while Whitethaw continued to drink. After drinking for over two hours, Whitethaw suddenly shivered when he took a sip of wine and said, &#x201C;Master, this one is good! I like this one!&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Oh?&#x201D; Ning was surprised. He waved his finger, causing some liquid to fly out of a gourd of wine off in the distance and into Ning&#x2019;s mouth. A pungent, sour, acidic taste instantly overfilled his mouth, followed by an absolutely foul aftertaste. It was so rancid that Ning couldn&#x2019;t help but twitch, and he immediately shut his mouth and turned to stare at Whitethaw: &#x201C;This one? You like this one?!&#x201D;</p><p>Ning liked all types of wine. Some wine was lightly flavored but had lasting aftertastes, others had flavors that permeated the entire body. He also enjoyed wine that would plunge his body and soul into a cool state of refreshedness&#x2026; but he absolutely hated sour, acidic, and incredibly pungent wine like this. Even Ning himself wasn&#x2019;t sure where he had found this wine; today was the first time for him to even bring it out of storage.</p><p>&#x201C;That&#x2019;s absolutely disgusting.&#x201D; Ning shook his head.</p><p>&#x201C;It&#x2019;s good!&#x201D; Whitethaw stared at Ning, wide-eyed.</p><p>&#x201C;&#x2026;Fine. The Chaosverse truly is filled with all sorts of marvels, including golems who like to drink wine like this. And who would even create this type of wine?! Ah, forget it. Come, let&#x2019;s drink together!&#x201D; Ning laughed. He finally had someone to drink with him now. Life had been quite boring recently. Hide-and-seek with these Hegemons and Emperors was extremely boring. It was too simple, given that his divine power clone was in perpetual control of the flaming passageways.</p><p>&#x201C;Master, do you have the feeling that something seems off?&#x201D; Whitethaw quickly began to grow more loquacious as the happy feeling from the wine flooded his body.</p><p>&#x201C;Something seems off?&#x201D; Ning was startled. &#x201C;What do you mean?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;The Hegemons in the flaming passageways here in the Jadefire Realm aren&#x2019;t working as hard as in the past in trying to hunt you down,&#x201D; Whitethaw said.</p><p>Ning laughed. &#x201C;Of course. It has been eighty thousand years! By now, they&#x2019;ve realized that catching me will be virtually impossible. There&#x2019;s no need for to chase as frantically as they would&#x2019;ve in the past.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;But they haven&#x2019;t exactly relaxed either. They&#x2019;ve started to set up a few small traps in the various passageways, such as masking formations that hide some of the terrifying mechanisms inherent within the passageways. They&#x2019;ve actually put down a few special-purpose formations to deal with me.&#x201D; Ning shook his head. &#x201C;They don&#x2019;t realize that all of their movements are under my observation and control.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Master, there are already eight Hegemons and ten other Emperors present. In the end, how many of them will have arrived in total for the sake of the realmship?&#x201D; Whitethaw said, worried.</p><p>Ning nodded slowly. He felt a sense of pressure as well. 80,000 years&#x2026; Hegemon Wuye and Hegemon Fogsun were both controlling realmships and thus both had delivered a first batch of Hegemons and Emperors to the Flamedragon Realmverse during this period of time. Hegemon Wuye&#x2019;s first batch had included five Hegemons and four Emperors, while Hegemon Fogsun&#x2019;s first batch included three Hegemons and six Emperors.</p><p>&#x201C;Based on my calculations, the second batches should arrive soon,&#x201D; Ning said seriously. &#x201C;I hope they will separately enter the flaming passageways as well. If they do so, I&#x2019;ll have a chance to stop them. My fear is that they will join forces and advance as one unit.&#x201D;</p><p>Hegemons had many and varied techniques. If four or five of them worked together, even if Ning unleashed the full power of the mechanisms in the flaming passageways he still wouldn&#x2019;t necessarily be able to stop all five of them!</p><p>After all, there were Hegemons who were extremely skilled in defense, so much so that they were a match for Otherverse Lords in this regard! Others specialized in speed, while still others specialized in karma. When they pooled their talents together, they would become extremely difficult to deal with.</p><p>&#x2026;&#x2026;</p><p>120,000 years after the public revealing of the existice of the realmship. Hegemon Wuye was sending the second batch of Hegemons and Emperors over on this date.</p><p>They had arrived next to a blazing star that looked like a fiery ball of heat. A spatial tear appeared in the void next to the star, followed by a realmship blinking through and coming to a halt next to it.</p><p>&#x201C;Gentlemen, we have arrived. Based on our latest information, Daolord Darknorth has remained in hiding within the Jadefire Realm this entire time, while none of the Hegemons or Emperors who have already reached the Jadefire Realm have been able to take the realmship from him. You all still stand a very good chance,&#x201D; Hegemon Wuye said with a laugh.</p><p>&#x201C;Regardless of who ends up with the realmship, you&#x2019;ve already made a fortune in treasure from this escapade, brother Wuye,&#x201D; one of the eight figures said upon flying out of the realmship.</p><p>&#x201C;I borrowed this realmship from my master. I&#x2019;m going to give most of the treasure to him!&#x201D; Hegemon Wuye glared at him. &#x201C;Not gonna waste words with you. I need to go pick up the final batch. I have a long road ahead of me.&#x201D; As he spoke, he took control of the realmship and flew off into the distance.</p><p>Eight figures remained there within the void, their auras mighty. One of them, a devilishly handsome man who radiated an aura of cold insidiousness, let out a cold snort: &#x201C;Everyone, you can go to the Jadefire Realm. I&#x2019;ll be there shortly.&#x201D; As he spoke, he took a step forwards and teleported through the air, vanishing.</p><p>&#x201C;Where is Hegemon Winterflame going off to?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Where do you think? Given the type of person he is, he&#x2019;s probably off to capture any and all of Daolord Darknorth&#x2019;s friends and family.&#x201D; The speaker was a bearded man dressed in simple gray robes who carried eight strange azure planks of wood on his back.</p><p>&#x201C;Winterfire always does stupid shit like this.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Brother Blackwood, don&#x2019;t worry about him. I&#x2019;ll tear through spacetime and lead the way.&#x201D; Of the group of eight who had just arrived, four were Hegemons, with Winterflame one of them. In truth, his status was the highest of the eight.</p><p>&#x201C;Let&#x2019;s go.&#x201D; Hegemon Blackwood, who was the bearded man with those eight pieces of azure wooden planks on his back, nodded.</p><p>&#x2026;&#x2026;</p><p>Whoosh. Tearing through spacetime at maximum speed, Hegemon Winterflame quickly arrived outside the Vastheaven Everworld. &#x201C;Here we are.&#x201D; Hegemon Winterflame stood there within the misty skies, staring at the distant Vastheaven Palace.</p><p>Hegemon Winterflame was dressed in white robes that glowed with blurry white light. His features were handsome to the point of appearing devilish, while his skin was so translucent and fine that one could almost see his blood vessels and veins. His eyes emanated an aura of terrifying coldness.</p><p>&#x201C;Based on the intelligence records I acquired, Archon Silksnow probably chased someone called &#x2018;Ninedust&#x2019; into the Jadefire Realm, then intentionally released word of this. Daolord Darknorth really did choose to ignore the danger and charge straight into the Jadefire Realm. He probably fought against Archon Silksnow inside, with Archon Silksnow eventually being defeated and force to commit suicide.&#x201D; Hegemon Winterflame nodded slowly. &#x201C;From this, we can tell that Daolord Darknorth is the sort of person who cares immensely about personal relationships.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;He knew it was a trap, but for his friend&#x2019;s sake he was still willing to risk his life and enter the Jadefire Realm&#x2026; hmph. Headstrong, sentimental fools like him are the easiest to deal with.&#x201D; Hegemon Winterflame&#x2019;s eyes glowed with cold light. &#x201C;The Ninedust Sectlord has probably already been rescued from the Jadefire Realm by Darknorth&#x2026; and the other friends Darknorth care about all probably reside in his clan, Vastheaven Palace!&#x201D;</p><p>Hegemon Winterflame stared at the distant Vastheaven Palace: &#x201C;All I need to do is to abduct everyone in Vastheaven Palace. The World-level cultivators, the Daolords, the Emperors&#x2026; I&#x2019;ll abduct them all and force Daolord Darknorth to give me the realmship in exchange for them. Given his personality, there&#x2019;s a chance he&#x2019;ll accept.&#x201D;</p><p><br></p><hr><p><br></p>
