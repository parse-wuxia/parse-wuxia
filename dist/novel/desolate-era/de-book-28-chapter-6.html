<p>Ji Ning, Prince Greatjoy, Solewind, and the others lived a life of leisure here at Wintermount. Although they were ten billion kilometers away, their gazes were still often turned towards what was happening at the spacetime transfer array.</p><p>&#x201C;This disciple of mine actually has some talent for the sword after all.&#x201D; Ning paid quite a bit of attention to his disciple. Although Yang Quding lived on Wintermount as well, nobody here was able to detect Ning&#x2019;s presence unless he wished it.</p><p>&#x201C;Brother Darknorth, this kid&#x2019;s sword-arts seem quite similar to your own Yin-Yang Sword Domain.&#x201D; Prince Greatjoy sat nearby, watching as Yang Quding trained in swordplay ten kilometers away. &#x201C;He trains by himself within the deep mountains, neither impatient nor hasty, and his heart is as calm as water. I have to say, his heart is quite impressive.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;He can be considered my disciple,&#x201D; Ning said with a laugh.</p><p>&#x201C;Disciple?&#x201D; Prince Greatjoy was shocked. &#x201C;You accepted an ordinary mortal as a disciple?&#x201D;</p><p>Although he had a good impression of Yang Quding, the man was still nothing more than an ordinary mortal. The five of them were amongst the most truly, freakishly talented figures of the entire Endless Territories. Even Skyfire Brightshore, who was currently still the weakest of the five, was a dazzling genius of the Brightshore Imperials. As for the other four, they all wielded their own Supreme Daos.</p><p>Any of them could break through into the Daolord level at any moment, and they would be extraordinary ones at that. Given Ning&#x2019;s status&#x2026; if he wanted to choose a disciple, virtually all World-level cultivators would be crying and begging for a chance to be chosen. And yet, he instead chose an ordinary mortal as his disciple?</p><p>&#x201C;Your disciple?&#x201D; The nearby Solewind laughed. &#x201C;We&#x2019;re just passing through this place. Why&#x2019;d you accept a disciple? And is this how you treat your disciples? You just completely ignore them?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Even if I wanted to mentor him, I wouldn&#x2019;t be able to do so for long. Better to just let him grow naturally.&#x201D; Ning took a slow sip of wine.</p><p>&#x201C;Brother Darknorth certainly takes it easy,&#x201D; Waterlord Firesurge said.</p><p>&#x2026;&#x2026;</p><p>In the blink of an eye, more than sixty-one years went past. The spacetime transfer array was almost ready once more.</p><p>&#x201C;Time to leave.&#x201D; Greatjoy rose to his feet.</p><p>&#x201C;Time to head out, Darknorth. Stop staring at your disciple,&#x201D; Solewind teased.</p><p>Ning had just glanced off into the distance. His second disciple, &#x2018;Green Bamboo&#x2019; Yang Quding, had long ago departed from Wintermount and was out adventuring through the world. He was already quite famous for millions of kilometers around, and was venerated as &#x2018;Sword Immortal Green Bamboo&#x2019;.</p><p>&#x201C;Time to go.&#x201D; Ning nodded.</p><p>Once he left, the two of them truly would have parted from each other. Once Ning returned to the Endless Territories, the two would be located within two separate universes. It truly was hard to say if they would ever meet again. It would all be up to fate.</p><p>Although the core of the spacetime transfer array was quite large, it was still completely packed with hundreds of millions of Nascent Soul cultivators and Apotheosis cultivators who had gathered here throughout this utterly massive continent.</p><p>&#x201C;Fellow Daoists, the ancient transfer array shall only be activated once every hundred years.&#x201D; A middle-ranked Apotheosis cultivator was standing in midair and speaking in a sonorous voice. &#x201C;Our Mortal Realm is unfathomably vast and filled with countless cultivators. Thus, I would like to invite all fellow Daoists interested in going to the Sacred Immortal Realm to first enter this estate-world! This estate-world is a very simple and crude one which is quite weak; any Apotheosis cultivator can easily tear it apart from within. All of us will enter this estate-world, and then the ancient transfer array will teleport it to the other side. This will be much easier.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Agreed.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Makes sense.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;This has been the standard method for many years.&#x201D;</p><p>Countless Nascent Soul cultivators and Apotheosis cultivators nodded in agreement. This was a custom that had been established many years ago. Otherwise, how was the array supposed to be able to accommodate hundreds of millions of cultivators? The estate-treasure before them was quite crude and simple. They were able to see through it to know what was going on outside, and were also able to tear through it at a moment&#x2019;s notice.</p><p>As for Ning&#x2019;s group of five, they were mixed into the enormous group of cultivators. No one paid them any heed.</p><p>&#x201C;Fellow Daoists, let us go inside together.&#x201D; The tall middle-aged man in midair was the first to fly towards the entrance of the estate-world which was placed at the very center of the ancient transfer array.</p><p>This estate-world was shaped like an actual Immortal estate, and it had a normal &#x2018;gate&#x2019;.</p><p>Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh!</p><p>Countless streaks of light flew towards the entrance as well.</p><p>&#x201C;Let&#x2019;s go.&#x201D; Ning&#x2019;s group of five followed the crowd into the estate as well.</p><p>&#x201C;It really is weak.&#x201D; The five found a corner within the estate-world, and no other cultivators were able to notice their presence. Ning laughed as he sent mentally, &#x201C;I feel like the slightest vibration would be enough to cause it to completely collapse.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Let me stabilize it a bit. I actually am worried about it splintering,&#x201D; Solewind said.</p><p>Rumble&#x2026;</p><p>A cultivator on the outside had just activated the spacetime transfer array. Because it had already stored up enough energy, it now was able to completely activate.</p><p>The hundreds of millions of Nascent Soul cultivators and Apotheosis cultivators gathered inside were all incredibly excited.</p><p>&#x201C;The Sacred Immortal Realm!&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;We&#x2019;re finally going to arrive at the Sacred Immortal Realm.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;All the elders of my school are in the Sacred Immortal Realm. According to the legends, there are far more cultivators in the Sacred Immortal Realm than there are in our world.&#x201D; They were all incredibly excited by this. Ever since they had embarked upon the path of cultivation, they had dreamed of one day reaching the apex of power in the Mortal Realm and then heading to the Sacred Immortal Realm.</p><p>Those qualified to head into the Sacred Immortal Realm were all major figures of the Mortal Realm.</p><p>&#x2026;&#x2026;</p><p>A short while later, the teleportation effect came to an end. The estate-world had been sent to the Sacred Immortal Realm.</p><p>Ji Ning&#x2019;s group had been relaxing in their little corner. Now, all of their faces tightened.</p><p>&#x201C;Something&#x2019;s wrong.&#x201D; Prince Greatjoy sent mentally, &#x201C;Everyone, let us hide ourselves for now and watch what happens.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Right.&#x201D; Ning and the others all nodded.</p><p>This feeble estate-world had virtually no impact on them at all. They were able to see through it to the outside world and knew what was happening outside.</p><p>&#x201C;We&#x2019;ve arrived.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;We&#x2019;ve arrived at the Sacred Immortal Realm.&#x201D; The hundreds of millions of Nascent Soul cultivators and Apotheosis cultivators were all incredibly excited.</p><p>Rumble&#x2026;</p><p>The shoddily-made estate-treasure blew apart with a boom.</p><p>The countless Nascent Soul cultivators and Apotheosis cultivators all suddenly appeared in midair, covering the skies and blocking out the sun like a horde of locusts.</p><p>&#x201C;Such dense elemental energy!&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;The elemental energy here is far denser than it is in our Mortal Realm.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;So this is the Sacred Immortal Realm?&#x201D; The countless cultivators all stared excitedly&#x2026; but suddenly, they saw a large number of stone pillars off in the distance. The stone pillars all had cultivators bound to them. Some were humanoid, some were monsters, and some were beasts. Although they looked different, all of them were covered with blood, wounds, and scars. Many of them had eyes filled with furious hatred.</p><p>Deathly silence.</p><p>The hundreds of millions of Nascent Soul cultivators and Apotheosis cultivators who had just arrived were all deathly silent.</p><p>Those cultivators bound to the stone pillars had clearly suffered countless types of torture. What was going on?</p><p>&#x201C;Another batch has arrived.&#x201D; One of the many bound and tormented cultivators let out a low mutter.</p><p>&#x201C;One batch after another. There&#x2019;s never an end.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Who can send a message to the people of the Mortal Realm? Tell them not to come to this &#x2018;Sacred Immortal Realm&#x2019;. Do not come!&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;I truly shouldn&#x2019;t have come here.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;I regret it so much.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Don&#x2019;t come to the Sacred Immortal Realm.&#x201D; The countless bound cultivators all mumbled and moaned in broken, pained voices.</p><p>As for the hundreds of millions of Nascent Soul cultivators and Apotheosis cultivators who had just arrived, they all knew that something was wrong. Their hearts were as cold as ice.</p><p>&#x201C;Ahahaha!&#x201D; Suddenly, the vast land began to tremble as a deep laugh rang out from the depths of the earth. Slowly, one mountain-like figure after another began to emerge from underground. There was over a hundred of these figures, and each one was thirty thousand meters tall. An aura of darkness spread out to cover the skies as they stared at the countless cultivators with their blood-red eyes.</p><p>A hundred towering figures, and every single one of them possessed an aura that caused the cultivators to quiver in terror.</p><p>&#x201C;Where are we?!&#x201D; A golden-robed man amidst the crowd tamped down his horror enough to say, &#x201C;This isn&#x2019;t the Sacred Immortal Rea-&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;This is the Sacred Immortal Realm.&#x201D; One of the towering forms spoke out in a thundering voice that shook Heaven and Earth. As he waved his hand, he caused an enormous cloth sack to appear.</p><p>Whoooooosh.</p><p>The cloth sack gave birth to an utterly, incredibly powerful sucking force. The hundreds of millions of Nascent Soul cultivators and Apotheosis cultivators tried to resist, but they were still forcibly sucked into the cloth sack. After all the cultivators were sucked away, the cloth sack shrank in size and flew back into the towering figure&#x2019;s hands.</p><p>&#x201C;A few more toys.&#x201D; The towering figure looked at the cloth sack, then let out a low laugh. &#x201C;Master shall be excited by this! I will go deliver him his toys. As for the rest of you, stay here and deal with the disobedient ones.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Alright.&#x201D; The other towering figures all nodded.</p><p>Whoosh.</p><p>The bag-holding figure quickly flew off into the distance.</p><p>Ning&#x2019;s group of five was standing there in midair. Given Prince Greatjoy&#x2019;s mastery over spacetime, the towering figures were completely unable to see them.</p><p>Ning&#x2019;s group just watched silently as this all happened.</p><p>&#x201C;A hundred Elder God-level golems.&#x201D; Ning narrowed his eyes as he sent mentally, &#x201C;And they spoke of a &#x2018;master&#x2019;. His master is most likely a Daolord.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Agreed. This &#x2018;Sacred Immortal Realm&#x2019; most likely has a Daolord standing behind it.&#x201D; Solewind had a solemn look on his face as well.</p><p>&#x201C;This will be trouble. Let&#x2019;s be careful as we investigate this matter,&#x201D; Prince Greatjoy said somberly.</p><p>&#x201C;Agreed.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Let&#x2019;s go.&#x201D;</p><p>The five of them left the area silently.</p><p><br></p><hr><p><br></p>
