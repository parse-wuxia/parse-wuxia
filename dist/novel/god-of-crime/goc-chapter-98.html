<p><span style="">Chapter 98 - Advance Notice of a Storm #3</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p><p><span style="">A few days later, it was Saturday night.</span></p><p><span style="">Since it was the weekend, the number of guards was minimized.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Tonight he was going to look at the first floor, and he would look at the basement on Sunday night.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk confirmed the guards&#x2019; work schedule in advance.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;It would be a pain if I disguised myself as a guard and then caused a stir with a doppelganger.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">In order to prevent this, he registered the faces and voices of four security guards in the Demon Revealing Mirror.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Luckily, he was able to get their clothes from the laundry room.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was the type of place where the employees brought their uniforms before leaving work.&#xA0;</span><span style="">No one would notice that one more security guard was working during the weekend.</span></p><p><span style="">It was 11 o&#x2019;clock on a Saturday night.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The nurses&#x2019; rounds tapered off at dusk so Tae-hyuk got up from the bed.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He took out the guard&#x2019;s uniform that was hidden under the table.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He chose a disguise that people wouldn&#x2019;t be surprised to see walking around, so a guard was perfect.&#xA0;</span><span style="">There was no accessory, such as a security rod or key, but if someone asked then he could just say he forgot it.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I worked as a guard in the past, so isn&#x2019;t this the perfect disguise?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The security guards patrolled from the place of low importance to the place of high importance.&#xA0;</span><span style="">If he understood their movements, then he would roughly know where they were.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Of course, he could ignore such things and move around as he wished.</span></p><p><span style="">However, this was a back alley hospital where illegal operations were performed.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Discipline was more strict compared to ordinary places.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Otherwise, it wouldn&#x2019;t be controlled.</span></p><p><span style="">He used the memories of the future to grasp the patrol route of the security guards.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Tae-hyuk looked at the pre-drawn blueprint.&#xA0;</span><span style="">There were many areas marked with a highlighter, all places with cameras or areas that needed a key to enter and exit.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;No matter how I look at it, the ground floor is hard. There are a lot of CCTVs installed near the secret room. Moreover, the number of security guards that patrol that area is twice as high as other areas. This means the hospital also thinks it is important.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Jung Eui-do had clearly said that he couldn&#x2019;t find any relics of the Japanese here, but why did he need to install so much equipment near that area?&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was literally a contradiction.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;It means that he must be hiding something.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Maybe he would obtain a clue to a crime.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I haven&#x2019;t got any crime skills recently. Ohuhuhu.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk quietly slipped from his room and acted as a guard patrolling.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The on-call nurse was dozing off at the desk.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;You worked hard.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The nurse turned and glanced at Tae-hyuk.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hmphh... Work hard now. Oh, can you go to the boiler room and raise the temperature of the radiator? It is a bit chilly.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I understand.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The nurse&#x2019;s head started to shake like a pendulum again as she dozed off.&#xA0;</span><span style="">She couldn&#x2019;t imagine that the security guard she was talking to had been a fake.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;She wouldn&#x2019;t know if a bandit was having a feast in the next room.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk was able to safely pass the nurse and enter the warehouse.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The blueprint showed that the secret room was in a corner.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The size wasn&#x2019;t so big so it was tight with two adult men.&#xA0;</span><span style="">But it was perfect for hiding something.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Tae-hyuk tapped the wall while listening carefully, then he found a different reaction.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Well. Here it is.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Once he arrived at a certain area, he heard a blunt sound, as if he was hitting an iron plate. Tae-hyuk took out a knife and carefully peeled off a section of the wallpaper.&#xA0;</span><span style="">A large steel cabinet was exposed through the wooden panels.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He touched the surface, but it didn&#x2019;t seem that old.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Hrmm...&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk cautiously opened the door. There were many documents that didn&#x2019;t have dust on them.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He pulled out a few and read them.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He could understand without needing to check any books.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It contained brief information on people who had received surgery.&#xA0;</span><span style="">There were also signs of buying and selling something.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;This much sensitive data isn&#x2019;t stored in digital form.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">As he turned over the papers, the Demon Revealing Mirror started ringing.</span></p><p><span style="">[Crime Skill: Illegal Surgery has been learned.]</span></p><p><span style="">-Various surgical operations can be done.</span></p><p><span style="">-However, treatment isn&#x2019;t possible.</span></p><p><span style="">-The criteria to fully learn it hasn&#x2019;t been met yet.</span></p><p><span style="">&apos;Illegal Surgery?! It seems to be an obscure skill...&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk stopped his hand over the papers.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The fact that the Demon Revealing Mirror responded meant there was something on the page that he just passed over.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He was able to find it without any difficulty.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;20 payments of nine million won... What is this?&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">He couldn&#x2019;t tell what it was for just by what was written.&#xA0;</span><span style="">However, it was certain that this was associated with a crime.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Once Tae-hyuk got what he wanted, he would slip out of here as quietly as possible.</span></p><p><span style="">However, it was a different story if he could get a crime skill.&#xA0;</span><span style="">If he knew what the crime was and destroyed it, then he could get the opponent&#x2019;s skill.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk took as many photos as possible.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Just the evidence of illegal abortions here was sufficient.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He would send the information to Kim Do-shik and Cho Kang-suk using Phantom&#x2019;s name, and they would take care of it.&#xA0;</span><span style="">However, he had to find out what the hidden crime was.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Maybe there isn&#x2019;t just clues to a hidden treasure.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk returned the documents to their original place.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He had enough 4K resolution photos on his SD card to cover the ceiling.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was sufficient to read the text on the photos.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk restored the wallpaper and quietly slipped out.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was time for the guards to make their rounds again.</span></p><p><span style="">All the puzzles would be solved tomorrow.</span></p><p><span style="">@</span></p><p><span style="">Blue Dragon was one of four prisons in the country operated using the American system.</span></p><p><span style="">It was built on an island far away from land, based on America&#x2019;s Alcatraz, a very famous prison where Al Capone was imprisoned.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Among the four prisons of the Red Phoenix, Black Tortoise, Blue Dragon, and White Tiger, the Blue Dragon was famous for being the most like Alcatraz.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Of course, the prisoners there were the ones who committed the worst crimes.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">The reason why the prison was created was simple.&#xA0;</span><span style="">A few politicians decided to declare war on crime before a general election.&#xA0;</span><span style="">They were elected with a high percentage of votes on the premise that the public didn&#x2019;t have to share the same air as the criminals.</span></p><p><span style="">Thus, the prisons of the four gods were born.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Weren&#x2019;t all the prisons built on naval bases that were built during the Japanese colonial period?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Kang-suk read the data and asked Hyun-ho who was sitting across from him.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Sunbae has a deep relationship with that place.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Huh? Why?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Yoo Cheol-ho is now trapped there so that he can&#x2019;t escape from jail again.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Kuoong... That name sounds familiar.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Kang-suk groaned as he remembered Yoo Cheol-ho.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The case had occurred over six months ago.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Yoo Cheol-ho had a high bounty on him after breaking out and Kang-suk met a weird student in the process.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I&#x2019;ve been quite busy since then.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;With who? Sister in law?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;S-Sister in law... C-Cough!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Kang-suk turned bright red and coughed.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Aish, please eat your noodles quicker.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I-I&#x2019;m trying!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The reason why Cho Kang-suk and Joo Hyun-ho gathered in the police library&#x2019;s data room to investigate the prison was simple: Park Sung-yul was imprisoned there.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Kang-suk suddenly thought of something.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Then Park Sung-yul is in the same prison as Yoo Cheol-ho?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;That&apos;s right. Isn&#x2019;t it filled with criminal all-stars?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;He told me that he would escape again from the next place he was imprisoned. Well, he would need to swim to get out of there.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;That&apos;s right. He would need to be a human seal.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Then it would be good to see him after a long time.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Kang-suk laughed.</span></p><p><span style="">Park Sung-yul confessed that he was a serial murderer who killed 14 people.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Kang-suk didn&#x2019;t know if it was the truth, but after following the puzzle he sent, they discovered another body.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Have the autopsy results come back?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Only that it happened a long time ago and that she died when she was in her late 20s.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;In the end, figuring out her identity is something we have to do from now on.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Kang-suk nodded without saying anything.&#xA0;</span><span style="">From now on, Cho Kang-suk and Joo Hyun-ho would go to question the criminal who was in jail.</span></p><p><span style="">They had to go to the infamous Blue Dragon Prison and find out if what he was saying was true.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Park Sung-yul had been stuck in jail for three years. If he committed murder, it was a crime that is at least three years old. All the evidence will be lost to the passage of time. We might literally have to put the pieces together like a puzzle.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Joo Hyun-ho smiled widely.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;But there is no mystery that Sunbae and I can&#x2019;t solve.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Why not? You know...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;That guy itself is a foul.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">After half a day, the two people boarded a ship heading for Blue Dragon Prison.</span></p><p><span style="">@</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Detectives, you have come.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The prison warden smiled and welcomed Kang-suk and Hyun-ho.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The officer who guided them to the door bowed.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Then have a good time!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Uh, thank you.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Hyun-ho whispered to Kang-suk.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Sunbae. The atmosphere here is strange.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Hey. Be careful what you say. Sound carries.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Come come, please sit down here first. I will come back with tea and refreshments.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Kang-suk said quietly,</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Warden-nim. Thank you for your sincerity. I only have 10 minutes for the visit. I would like to meet him right away.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Then the warden laughed,</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;You don&#x2019;t know how to deal with the prisoners yet. Visitation days are like festivals to them. They get a morning bath and they can wear neat clothes that they don&#x2019;t normally wear. In their eyes, the people of the world... Ah, I&#x2019;m sorry. I&apos;ll correct it to the outside world. At any rate, everything will be the same. So why don&#x2019;t you go and make them wait? Then you will be able to hear what you want from them. I think they are great people.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Then you are telling us to go late on purpose?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Until the coffee cools and the beer foam disappears. You should be roughly 20~30 minutes late. That is the law in dealing with them.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">It was definitely a hierarchical relationship.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was the way of the guards.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It seemed useless but the warden was a man who worked with prisoners for decades.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He had more experience in dealing with them.</span></p><p><span style="">Hyun-ho saw that Kang-suk&#x2019;s expression wasn&#x2019;t good and said,</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Sunbae, let&#x2019;s do as the warden said. Deliberately delaying the appointment is also a technique used in negotiation.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Two people were making the same argument.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Kang-suk licked his lips.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I understand. Then I will have a cup of tea before going.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I have some good quality tea leaves.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Kang-suk went to see Park Sung-yul after spending a moderate amount of time drinking tea and eating sweets.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The officer warned them before they entered the room,</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Even if he is tied up, I don&#x2019;t know what he will do. Be careful.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">It was encouraged to only converse with prisoners while fully shielded by tempered glass.&#xA0;</span><span style="">However, Kang-suk said that he would talk in the family visitation room.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The other person would be wearing a straitjacket but he would be in the same room.</span></p><p><span style="">Hyun-ho nodded and said,</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Well, will you be able to obtain information by feeling it with your skin?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">It wasn&#x2019;t wrong but the nuances were strange.</span></p><p><span style="">Kang-suk elbowed Hyun-ho&#x2019;s side.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Something like that. Also, the atmosphere is important in an interrogation. I can tell whether it is a lie or truth based on the air he breathes onto my skin.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;In short, your senses.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Kang-suk laughed at the words. but it was right.</span></p><p><span style="">Park Sung-yul was sitting at a table in the corner of the visitation room.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Despite wearing a straitjacket for over 30 minutes, his face was full of relaxation.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He had a sophisticated look that would make him look like a business executive if he was wearing a suit instead of the prisoner jumpsuit.</span></p><p><span style="">Park Sung-yul laughed when he saw Kang-suk, as if he was meeting an old friend.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Detective Cho Kang-suk! I&#x2019;ve been looking forward to seeing you for a long time. I wanted to see you.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;Park Sung-yul.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Huh?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Kang-suk skipped all the trivial things and threw a fastball at once.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Did you really kill 14 people?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Park Sung-yul was silent for a moment before slowly opening his mouth.</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p>
