There are also a lot of security guards.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">The basement was complicated like a maze.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The reason was simple.</span></p><p><span style="">&apos;If anyone is lucky enough to escape then they won&#x2019;t be able to get out.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk remembered that the structure of the prison was also like this.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The prison memories that popped into his head were truly unpleasant.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;I am worried that someone unrelated to Doll Play will get involved. It is useless. When I think about it, aren&#x2019;t even the cleaners accomplices? At the very least, they know what they are cleaning up.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">As Tae-hyuk made a plan to infiltrate, the radio started making a noise.</span></p><p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">It is the regular reporting time.</span></i> <i><span style="">Is anything wrong?</span></i></p><p><span style="">At the moment, Tae-hyuk&apos;s mind came up with a plan.</span></p><p><span style="">[Voice Modulation has been used.]</span></p><p><span style="">-You can imitate the voice of Kyung Bi-won.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;There is nothing wrong. However, there is smoke coming out from the vents. Are there any problems in the basement?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Then a cough was heard from the radio.</span></p><p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">Cough!</span></i> <i><span style="">Really?</span></i> <i><span style="">I guess I should check it out.</span></i> <i><span style="">You have a little bit of time left on your shift so keep an eye out.</span></i> <i><span style="">There is one more work in the afternoon.</span></i></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I understand. Keep up the good work.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk shrugged and pressed the button on the radio.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Of course, it was an absolute lie.&#xA0;</span><span style="">But from now on, the security guards would desperately be trying to find out where the smoke was coming from.</span></p><p><span style="">What would happen if he lit a real fire in the meantime?&#xA0;</span><span style="">Of course, a huge mess would occur.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk muttered as he looked at the boiler room on the map.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;No matter how fierce the guards are, I will create a big crack.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">@</span></p><p><span style="">The boiler room was outside for ventilation.&#xA0;</span><span style="">There were dozens of hundred liter drums that were responsible for heating the entire building.&#xA0;</span><span style="">After one was used, it would be recycled to take care of the bodies.</span></p><p><span style="">It was a place that had to be strictly managed, but there was only one person in charge of it.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He was sitting on a chair and sleeping with empty soju bottles on the floor.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Tae-hyuk tied up the boiler room manager with a rope and gagged him.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Despite that, there were no signs of him waking up.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It seemed like he could even sleep through a bomb explosion.</span></p><p><i><span style="">Dung dung!</span></i></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk found an empty drum and installed a bomb there.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was the most sensitive one he had, so it would explode if there was even a small shock.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He hid it between drums containing oil.</span></p><p><span style="">He opened the lids of the other drums and placed military grade tear gas inside.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Any man who was in the army would be very familiar with it.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Taking one sip would make them feel the pain of falling into hell.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;I don&#x2019;t have a gas mask so I&#x2019;ll have to struggle as I&#x2019;m going inside.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">He mixed all the smoke bombs he had with tear gas as well.&#xA0;</span><span style="">This would fill the place with a special smoke made from tear gas and smoke bombs.&#xA0;</span><span style="">On the surface, it would look like a fire in the boiler room.&#xA0;</span><span style="">His work went smoothly, due to the 40 points in dexterity.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk made a satisfied expression and headed for B2.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Huhu... It is a mess.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The building seemed to be in half emergency mode.&#xA0;</span><span style="">People dressed as security guards were frantically running around.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It wouldn&#x2019; t be good to encounter them.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Tae-hyuk grabbed the iron pipe and held his breath as he hid inside the vents.</span></p><p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">Where is the smoke coming from?</span></i></p><p><span style="">He heard an urgent voice over the radio.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk deliberately replied in a trembling voice,</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ah, it seems to be the boiler room.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">F-Fuck...</span></i> <i><span style="">What the hell is the manager doing?</span></i> <i><span style="">I understand.</span></i> <i><span style="">Continue to report on the situation.</span></i></p><p><span style="">After a while, a bunch of security guards ran out of the building.&#xA0;</span><span style="">There were also personnel from T Medical Center who managed the power.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Then shall I enter the empty house?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">It would take around 10 minutes for the guards to find out that the boiler room wasn&#x2019;t on fire.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Before that, he had to collect the evidence and save the children trapped in B2.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He couldn&#x2019;t delay for even one second.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk exited the vent and headed to B2.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The structure was the same as the first basement floor. There was a corridor and rooms with windows.</span></p><p><span style="">However, the mood changed.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was like sticky death was stuck to the soles of his feet.&#xA0;</span><span style="">There was a groaning sound, as if there was an injured animal somewhere.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hrmm. There is a drum.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">It was sitting in the middle of the corridor.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The person who was moving it probably rushed out due to the fire in the boiler room.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Tae-hyuk gathered his courage and beat the drum.</span></p><p><span style="">A sound was heard.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was filled with something, and it wasn&#x2019;t oil.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Tae-hyuk carefully opened the firmly closed lid. A smoke with an unpleasant smell emerged.</span></p><p><span style="">Sulfuric acid.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Tae-hyuk was careful not to breathe in the toxic gas as he confirmed what was inside.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The thing that was melting inside...</span></p><p><span style="">@</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk caught the reality of T Medical Center through the camera installed in the opera mask.</span></p><p><span style="">The evidence within was more than what he had initially imagined.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Cutting a person&#x2019;s body without proper anesthesia.&#xA0;</span><span style="">People were raised like livestock until a suitable match was found.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk&#x2019;s heart calmed like a frozen lake.</span></p><p><span style="">It was anger.</span></p><p><span style="">The doctors of T Medical Center didn&#x2019;t regard those here as human.</span></p><p><span style="">&apos;Wasn&#x2019;t there a surgery scheduled for this afternoon?&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk headed to the operating room that was in the deepest part of B2.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Once he opened the door, he saw the tragedy happening within.&#xA0;</span><span style="">A naked girl was tied on top of the table in the operating room.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was Kim Soo-bin who Song Hye-mi had been searching for.</span></p><p><span style="">Dr J. stopped the hands that were cutting into her body and looked back.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Their eyes met.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The first one to open his mouth was Dr. J.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;What?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I&#x2019;m sorry for interrupting you. I am just a criminal passing by.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Criminal?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes. From now on, I plan to blow up this place.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What...?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Dr. J looked at him with an absurd expression.&#xA0;</span><span style="">A man wearing a strange mask was saying funny words.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He didn&#x2019;t know how the man got in here, but he seemed to be crazy.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Dr. J put down the scalpel he was holding and picked up a radio.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;This is the doctor. How are you doing your jobs? There is a strange person...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk smiled and slammed the iron pipe down on Dr. J&#x2019;s head, causing him to instantly collapse onto the ground.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;D-Doctor!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Oh Shil-jang, the cleaner, screamed from where he was holding Kim Soo-bin&#x2019;s body.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He pulled out a gun from his pocket and aimed at Tae-hyuk.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Drop your weapon now! Before a bullet enters your head!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;You seem confident now that you have the gun. Isn&#x2019;t it incomplete though?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;What?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;It means that no one would be scared of a gun that isn&#x2019;t loaded with bullets.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Oh Shil-jang&#x2019;s face distorted.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was the right answer.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The first time he had held a gun was one hour ago.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The confused Oh Shil-jang looked into the muzzle.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I&apos;m sorry but that was a lie.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk hit the opponent&#x2019;s hand with his pipe.&#xA0;</span><span style="">There was a loud noise as Oh Shil-jang fell to the ground.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Tsk tsk. You should always pay attention to the direction of the muzzle.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk clicked his tongue as he released Kim Soo-bin from the operating table.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Her condition was bad.&#xA0;</span><span style="">One arm was cut off, and there was a scar on her body that would never be erased.&#xA0;</span><span style="">But she was still alive.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Kim Soo-bin?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;......&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Kim Soo-bin looked up at Tae-hyuk with eyes glazed from the anesthetic.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It seemed like she couldn&#x2019;t tell if this was a dream or reality.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Tae-hyuk slapped Kim Soo-bin&#x2019;s cheeks.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;...W-What? Why is this pers... Kyaaaaak!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Kim Soo-bin screamed as she regained her bearings.&#xA0;</span><span style="">A man&#x2019;s head had been blown away in front of her.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;If you&#x2019;ve regained your consciousness then somehow get up. I&apos;m sorry but there is no time.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;...Are you here to save me?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;It is just a bonus, but in the end I guess so.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;B-Bonu...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Kim Soo-bin staggered as she desperately got down from the operating table.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Fortunately, her legs were fine.&#xA0;</span><span style="">She suddenly realized that she was naked.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Her one arm was unable to hide all of her body.</span></p><p><span style="">Kim Soo-bin said with a stutter.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I-In a situation like this, shouldn&#x2019;t you usually take off your clothes?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I&apos;m sorry but I&#x2019;m not a gentleman.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk smiled before handing over Oh Shil-jang&#x2019;s coat.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He handed it to Kim Soo-bin, despite the blood dripping on it.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He wanted her to wear clothes from an unidentified white lump?</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;T-This...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;If you don&apos;t like it then don&#x2019;t wear it.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Kim Soo-bin was forced to wear Oh Shil-jang&#x2019;s clothes.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I&#x2019;ll just ask you one thing. Do you know how many children are left?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Kim Soo-bin replied in a cracked voice,</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Maybe five people are left. I don&apos;t know exactly, but I am sure that they are locked up here.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Really? We will get them and then escape from here. Kim Soo-bin. Will you help me?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Kim Soo-bin&#x2019;s eyes widened as the man who saved her asked for her help.&#xA0;</span><span style="">But this man was the only one she could trust.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes, I will help.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes. Thank you.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Wait a minute. What should I call you?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Kim Soo-bin saw a soft smile appear on the face of the man wearing the opera mask and inwardly sighed with relief.&#xA0;</span><span style="">She didn&#x2019;t know his identity but he didn&#x2019;t seem like a bad guy.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;You mean me? I am called Phantom.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Phantom?&quot;</span></p><p><span style=""> &#x201C;Yes.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Are you someone like a police officer or detective?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk laughed,</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I&apos;m sorry but I&#x2019;m not such a great person. At best, I am just a criminal.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;But you saved me. Ah, I see. Are you a criminal who judges other criminals?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hah, that&#x2019;s right.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk and Kim Soo-bin moved out of the operating room to save the other children.</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p>
