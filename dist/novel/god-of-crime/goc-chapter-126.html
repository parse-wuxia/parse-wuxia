<p><span style="">Chapter 126 - Swallow the Sun #4</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p><p><span style="">&quot;I will give up this falsehood and show you my true image.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Lee Gun-woo and the believers were affected by the incense.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Counterfeit was a crime skill that changed the form of things and made them look different.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The same could also be applied to gases.</span></p><p><span style="">&apos;Make the scent a cloud.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">The fragrance, which hadn&#x2019;t been visible until now, wrapped around Tae-hyuk like a cloud.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;C-Cloud...!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;He is clearly Pungbaek who has the abilities to create clouds!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Waaaaahhhhh!&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">The crowd of believers shouted.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Up to this point, it was the best magic.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Taoist magic.&#xA0;</span><span style="">No, he needed a bit more to bring it to the realm of Taoist magic.</span></p><p><span style="">First of all, he disguised himself as Kim Hyun-do, the director of the art museum who had a curious atmosphere.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He changed his clothes to those worn in a Gojoseon drama.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It actually didn&#x2019;t matter what clothing he wore.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was enough if he could overwhelm them with the atmosphere.</span></p><p><span style="">&apos;There is a lot of smoke in the room that blurs judgement. I will use everything I can!&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk moved the clouds around his body towards the believers.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The bishops seemed familiar with the smoke, but the believers were different.&#xA0;</span><span style="">There were those who bowed or wailed like a child.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk looked at the curtain.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The situation meant that the king had to come out.</span></p><p><span style="">Some time passed by.</span></p><p><span style="">The leader, who had never been seen before, slowly walked forward.</span></p><p><span style="">@</span></p><p><span style="">The man had a corpse-like face.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He had pale white skin. Unfocused pupils. White lips.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It felt like opening a coffin and looking at the person inside.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He didn&#x2019;t seem like a living person at all.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was difficult to guess his age because there were no fine lines on his face.</span></p><p><span style="">But although he pretended to be as calm as possible, he couldn&#x2019;t hide his fingers shaking with tension.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He opened his mouth with a veneer of calm,</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Are you really Pungbaek?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">It was a clear question.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk narrowed his eyes and looked at the leader.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He knew how much pressure silence would give in this situation, so he decided to use it moderately.</span></p><p><span style="">The reason why Tae-hyuk proclaimed himself as Pungbaek was simple.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Unlike Unsa and Usa who were called masters, Pungbaek was the head of the 3,000 followers and was called Earl.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He was called Wind Master, Verve, Rain master, Head of a Thousand Arms, etc. However, his most famous title was Pungbaek.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Despite going through hundreds of rebirths through the cycle of life and death, have you forgotten the face of the firstborn?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">The dignified figure was literally the God of Wind.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;...T-Then show me the evidence. This isn&#x2019;t enough to prove that you are Pungbaek.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">It was one of the bishops who attacked first.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He asked Tae-hyuk to prove that he was truly Pungbaek in order to raise doubts.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was the modus operandi of those who pretended to have powers.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Maybe it has been too long. As long as the sun exists, the wind, rain and clouds will forever repeat their lives and deaths. It is no wonder that Usa doesn&#x2019;t remember me.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">He felt goosebumps form as he continued talking in the tone of a historical drama.&#xA0;</span><span style="">However, it was why he used Kim Bum-soo&#x2019;s voice.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He could now speak for several hours.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk waved his hands and the clouds moved along with his body.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Repeatedly using Counterfeit was very tiring, but the effect was enormous.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Usa and Unsa are unsatisfied with the human body and repeated the cycle of reincarnation. And now the name of the leader is clearly...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">He paused for a moment, heightening the atmosphere.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Then he slowly called the opponent&#x2019;s name.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Cho Min-hyuk.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;......!&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Cho Min-hyuk&#x2019;s calm face suddenly distorted.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;There is no need to be surprised, but your people seem to be carrying a little bit of dirt.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk walked lightly to Song Chi-hyun and touched his shoulders.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was a soft touch, like a massage.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Robbery!&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">At the same time, a sharp knife appeared in Tae-hyuk&#x2019;s hands.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Hueeok!&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Song Chi-hyun groaned like he had seen a ghost.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The knife had been hidden in his clothes.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Yet the other person took it just by lightly touching his body.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He wouldn&#x2019;t have believed it if he hadn&#x2019;t seen it directly with his own eyes.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It wasn&#x2019;t a technique that humans could show.</span></p><p><span style="">Moreover, this wasn&#x2019;t the end.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Tae-hyuk turned the knife a few times like he was shaking off the dust, then stabbed it in Song Chi-hyun&#x2019;s belly.</span></p><p><i><span style="">Hwaaaaack!</span></i></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Kwaaaack!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">At the unexpected attack, Song Chi-hyun grabbed his bloody belly and collapsed.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;W-What?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Pungbaek attacked Usa!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Ah, no, he clearly said that Hwanin... Is that Usa fake?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Was he killed because he is a fake? Ah, he is still alive!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;What is going on?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk laughed and replied,</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;You don&apos;t have to worry. I did this as a demonstration.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk beckoned to the believers near Song Chi-hyun.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Take off his robe.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Huh? Ah, yes!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The scared believers stripped off Song Chi-hyun&#x2019;s heavy robes.&#xA0;</span><span style="">They saw the blood that spurted from the stab wound.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Then there were alarmed screams!</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;H-He is dead!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;P-Pungbaek! Please have mercy!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Pungbaek!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk stretched out his hand towards Song Chi-hyun.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The cloud surrounding his body spread towards Song Chi-hyun.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Then a miracle happened.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;W-What am I seeing now...?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;The wound is healed!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Ahh, P-Pungbaek. It is really Pungbaek...!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Song Chi-hyun groaned and sat up.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He touched his belly with a bewildered look.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;H-Heok! W-What? Wasn&#x2019;t I obviously stabbed by a knife?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The believers were stunned by the sight and there were those who even fainted.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Song Chi-hyun looked over at the celestial being.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Yes, celestial being.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He was a real celestial being.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;R-R-R-Rea...!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">He was so agitated that words couldn&#x2019;t come out properly.</span></p><p><span style="">When they first met, he thought the other person was just a high school teacher.&#xA0;</span><span style="">However, he had changed into a god.&#xA0;</span><span style="">A miracle occurred that was different from the scam they had been doing so far.</span></p><p><span style="">One hand could control wind and clouds, and the other could treat fatal injuries.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He was literally a heavenly being from the stories.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Song Chi-hyun unknowingly fell to his knees.</span></p><p><span style="">&apos;If I expose them as fake, then I can break the Sun Cult. But then I won&#x2019;t be able to get what I want. Now...&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">He had acted a perfect play.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The bishops and believers thought he was Pungbaek.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He could dismantle Sun with simple words.</span></p><p><span style="">But before that, there was information he needed to obtain.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The play couldn&#x2019;t finish yet.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk said with a stern expression,</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;You seem to be misunderstanding something. I didn&#x2019;t come here to punish anyone.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;W-What?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk slowly looked at the leader.</span></p><p><span style="">He accumulated followers by becoming the object of faith.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;It was three years ago that Cho Min-hyuk found Usa&#x2019;s powers and memories. On September 17. After that, he started looking for his brothers and sisters.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">It was exactly when Sun was created.&#xA0;</span><span style="">If the leader denied the words, then it was like confessing this was a scam.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He had no choice but to agree to the nonsense.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;All the believers gathered here in the name of Hwanin. It is reported that you wish to return to being human.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk stopped for a moment and looked at the leader.&#xA0;</span><span style="">If he didn&#x2019;t want the scam to be revealed, then he needed to talk.&#xA0;</span><span style="">However, a strange answer was heard.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;A-Am I really Usa?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk&#x2019;s play was so plausible that even the leader was completely deceived.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Tae-hyuk inwardly laughed.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;You shouldn&#x2019;t forget. Ah...&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">He had to continue until the end.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Are you remembering now, Usa? I came here to check if you have recovered your memories.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Cough...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Don&apos;t get confused. The cycle of reincarnation has repeated for thousands of years, so it is natural to be like this.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;......&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;At first, I came to confirm that you are well. But it seems that while Usa was trying to find your siblings, you called the wrong things.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;W-What are you saying?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Hwanung sealed the numerous evil spirits in the world. Nothing lasts forever in front of time. Even though Hwanung&#x2019;s technique is great, he can&#x2019;t keep them sealed up forever. It will gradually leak and disappear naturally. The evil spirits were attracted to all of you and gathered here. This amount is too large to be purified by itself.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Do you mean there are a lot of evil spirits here?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I don&#x2019;t think Usa&#x2019;s abilities and memories are perfect yet. If everybody here isn&#x2019;t cleansed quickly, then their lives will be at stake.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;......!&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">The believers that listened to Tae-hyuk&#x2019;s words collapsed on the spot.&#xA0;</span><span style="">They had gathered here to serve Hwanin.&#xA0;</span><span style="">But due to that, the evil spirits had gathered.&#xA0;</span><span style="">They never even imagined.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;You don&#x2019;t have to worry. Isn&#x2019;t Pungbaek right in front of you? I will do the purification ceremony myself.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tears flowed from the eyes of the moved believers.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;T-Thank you. Pungbaek!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Thank you!&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk moved his gaze from the believers towards the leader.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;How about it? Will you help me?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I-I will help. Pungbaek.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The fake Pungbaek next to the leader said,</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;L-Lord...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I&apos;m sorry but this is the end of your role. He is the real Pungbaek.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Thus, everything about the cult was handed over to Tae-hyuk.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Tae-hyuk watched them and muttered in a small voice,</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I&apos;ll eat well.&quot;</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p>
