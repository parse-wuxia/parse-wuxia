<p><span style="">Chapter 133 - Traces of the Mask #3</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p><p><span style="">This was obviously a mistake.</span></p><p><span style="">In order to move as stealthily as possible, she only came to South Korea with her right hand man, Semon.&#xA0;</span><span style="">She was completely caught off guard since no one else knew about it.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;They didn&#x2019;t see Semon and I, so they started searching directly. And they found us.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">Visiting South Korea without anyone knowing actually made it easier for her enemies.&#xA0;</span><span style="">If she died here, it would be the end.&#xA0;</span><span style="">She had worked her entire life to become the boss of the Red Mafia.&#xA0;</span><span style="">But at the end of the day, she would put her life in the hands of someone else.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was a person who she didn&#x2019;t even know what he looked like.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">Anne bit her lip as Semon handed over his weapon.</span></p><p><span style="">Semon asked with a determined face,</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I&apos;m sorry but my top priority is protecting the Young Lady. Is it really okay?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;It looks like you are prepared to die, but I&#x2019;m sorry. I don&#x2019;t have immunity to such embarrassing dialogue. You can say those words after I finish this. However, I&#x2019;ve only held a gun a few times. Shouldn&#x2019;t you loosen the safety pin of that grenade just in case?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;T-This isn&#x2019;t a game!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;P-Phantom...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;It is a joke. If it is a gun, then don&#x2019;t worry too much.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Anne smiled despite the dangerous situation.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He really didn&#x2019;t look like a reliable man, but she couldn&#x2019;t help feeling strange.</span></p><p><span style="">Anne muttered in a small voice that couldn&#x2019;t be heard by Semon and Phantom.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Go, Phantom. Prove that you are a man fit to be my companion.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">As if he heard her words, Phantom walked to the window with the submachine gun.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Madness was in the eyes hidden behind the white opera mask.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Now, Bullet Time.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">@</span></p><p><span style="">His weapons were a PPSH-41 and a pistol.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The drum cartridge was filled with 71 bullets.&#xA0;</span><span style="">However, it would fall in 10 seconds in a shooting spree.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;The ammo is scarce. I need to spread it out among the targets.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk hid behind a wall and used Spying.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He could see the detailed data of the approaching assailants.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Thanks to that, he could see what they were armed with.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;PPD-34s, Thompsons... It is like someone is filming a mafia movie.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">They were weapons used by the Soviet army during World War Two.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Now they were a favourite among the Red Mafia.</span></p><p><span style="">Hawk Eyes meant that he could read the opponents&#x2019; fragmented mindset.</span></p><p><span style="">[Phantom is inside. I should move with the utmost care!]</span></p><p><span style="">[It is a group of three...]</span></p><p><span style="">[First of all, we should move in three parts...]</span></p><p><span style="">He could know all the tactics that they were planning.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was like a real time strategy simulation game.</span></p><p><span style="">&apos;Now it is time to test out Shooting Spree.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">He used the crime skill on the PPSH - 41, famously know as the Papasha.</span></p><p><span style="">[You have used Shooting Spree.]</span></p><p><span style="">-You can handle all firearms.</span></p><p><span style="">-The hit rate correction is applied.</span></p><p><span style="">-Sixth Sense is activated.</span></p><p><span style="">&apos;Sixth Sense? I can use it with a gun, as well as the iron pipe?&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">Sixth Sense was a named attribute for the Violence skill.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He could detect when others were attacking.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Yet Sixth Sense could be activated with Shooting Spree?</span></p><p><span style="">In front of Tae-hyuk&#x2019;s eyes, red lines appeared as though there was a laser pointer.&#xA0;</span><span style="">There wasn&#x2019;t just one, but dozens of them.</span></p><p><span style="">&apos;Is this the bullet trajectory lines?&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">The enemies were pointing a gun at him from the other side of these lines.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Tae-hyuk licked his lips and stuck out his tongue.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Bullet Time slows down time. These are the bullet lines? If I use the two attributes at the same time... Aren&#x2019;t I completely invincible?&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">Even if he saw the bullet lines, his body wouldn&#x2019;t respond, and it would be impossible to avoid the bullets.&#xA0;</span><span style="">However, what if he used Bullet Time as well?&#xA0;</span><span style="">Moreover, Tae-hyuk&#x2019;s agility was now more than 60 points.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was possible for him to move beyond the limits of a human.</span></p><p><span style="">Once everything was combined-</span></p><p><span style="">-00:00:00&#x2019; &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;&#x432;&#x44B;&#x43B;&#x430;&#x437;&#x43A;&#x430; (Rush)!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Someone cried out and the group burst through the cafe door.&#xA0;</span><span style="">At that moment, Tae-hyuk used Bullet Time.</span></p><p><i><span style="">Chiing!</span></i></p><p><span style="">There was a ringing in his ears and the world turned grey.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;In&#x2014;he&#x2014;re.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Semon&#x2019;s scream, as he dragged Anne behind the counter, slowly reached Tae-hyuk&#x2019;s ears.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk moved his hand first.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It moved like he was within a turbulent torrent.</span></p><p><span style="">&apos;Is it because time is slowed? My mind is literally accelerating.&#x2019;</span></p><p><i><span style="">Ta</span></i><span style="">&#x2015;&#x2015;&#x2015;&#x2015;&#x2015;</span><i><span style="">ng!</span></i></p><p><span style="">Bullets were fired by the enemies along the bullet lines.&#xA0;</span><span style="">They were coming so slowly that he felt like he could catch them with his hands.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Of course, I won&#x2019;t do such a stunt until I am more accustomed to the accelerated state. First, just concentration on avoiding the enemy&#x2019;s bullet lines.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">He wasn&#x2019;t even wearing proper body armour.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He hadn&#x2019;t triggered Damage to Both Sides, so he should avoid being hit by the guns.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;First one!&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk fired his gun towards the mafia.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Then he aimed for his next target.</span></p><p><i><span style="">Dududu!</span></i></p><p><span style="">Nine bullets penetrated four bodies.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Every shot hit the target.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk hid himself behind a table.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Hu... Bullet Time off!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Once the ability was activated, time became dozens of times slower.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Moving in an accelerated state consumed a lot of power.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;First of all, I have to deal with the enemies with bullet lines.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">Anne shouted excitedly from where she was hiding.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x425;&#x43E;&#x440;&#x43E;&#x448;&#x43E;&#x2026;&#x2026;. F-Four people in an instant...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Unfortunately, he couldn&#x2019;t afford to answer her cheers.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Numerous messages were appearing and then disappearing on the Demon Revealing Mirror.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Tae-hyuk licked his lips as he confirmed all of it.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It seemed like there was a lull in the battlefield that Semon and Anne could use to escape.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;It is better to go out the back door. It seems like they are trying to blow this place up.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;H-How do you know that?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I told you. Trade secrets.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk finished speaking and fired the pistol at the mafia approaching through the back door.</span></p><p><i><span style="">Tang, tang, tang!</span></i></p><p><span style="">Three bullets pierced the opponent&#x2019;s body precisely.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He had terrifying shooting skills, like he had eyes in the back of his head.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Take some cover. I will deal with these people. Then there are three bullets left in this pistol.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Anne and Semon ran through the gap that Tae-hyuk created.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The enemies were divided between the front and the back to narrow down the siege.&#xA0;</span><span style="">They thought it would isolate the people inside, but it just ended up dispersing their power.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;It is an honor to be killed by me. Besides, didn&#x2019;t you strike first?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk once again used Bullet Time and ran out the front door.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Then he heard a buzzing sound, like a mosquito.&#xA0;</span><span style="">An RPG-7 was being set up to attack the cafe dozens of metres away.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Anti-tank rocket? As expected, they are planning to blow away the whole building. Aren&#x2019;t there other mafia members inside?&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk aimed his gun at the person putting together the RPG-7.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2015;&#x2015;&#x2015;.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The mafia was confused by the unexpected attack and looked around for Tae-hyuk.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;This is too slow; I almost feel like yawning. By the way, what will happen if I shoot at that missile primer?&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">It was worth a try.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Tae-hyuk pulled the trigger as he avoided the bullet line by moving to the side.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Flames burst as the RPG-7 exploded.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;That roughly dealt with five people. Now it is time for the rest.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">The mafia members rushed away as the RPG suddenly exploded.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was easy to suppress them by using the rest of the bullets.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk released Bullet Time and muttered,</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I recommend studying from Zhuge Liang in Romance of the Three Kingdoms.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">After checking for any additional bullet liens nearby, he quickly headed towards the back of the cafe.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The people there never dreamt that their allies at the entrance had been destroyed.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;If we wait here, then the targets will come out. Make sure you don&#x2019;t miss a shot.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk aimed at the leader who was giving instructions.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Kuaaack!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;W-Where is the attack coming from?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I heard the sound of an explosion. Perhaps the A unit...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Damn! What the hell is this...?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">They weren&#x2019;t well-trained soldiers, just people who could fire a gun.&#xA0;</span><span style="">After the leader died, the rest turned into rabble.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;S-Save me! He will kill us all!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk deliberately didn&#x2019;t attack the people who were running away.&#xA0;</span><span style="">They would go home and tell of the fearsome Phantom.</span></p><p><span style="">If he saw a number of bullet lines then he would trigger Bullet Time to avoid them.&#xA0;</span><span style="">With that alone, the bullets weren&#x2019;t able to hit Tae-hyuk.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;M-Monster...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Someone cried out as he was shot in the leg.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Monster? Excuse me. I am Phantom.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">By the time all the people were overpowered, the time limit of Bullet Time had reached zero.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Tae-hyuk slowly sighed and muttered,</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Exactly 10 minutes.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk wiped out the mafia members at a tremendous speed.</span></p><p><span style="">@</span></p><p><span style="">Semon, who was hiding behind the building, stuck out his head to check the situation once the gunshots ceased.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Then he muttered as he saw the bodies lying all over the place.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Oh, god...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Anne covered her mouth with both hands as she saw the horrible scene.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was enough to make a young child scream.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Oh my god... He did all this alone?&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">Anne turned to look at Phantom who was squatting in a corner.</span></p><p><span style="">Phantom looked over from where he was picking up the firearms.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Ah? This? The police will come soon, so I should take anything usable before that. It is hard to get these things in South Korea.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Y-You... How did you, no wounds...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk fiddled with the opera mask as he approached Anne.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Unfortunately, he could only take three guns.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Besides, there weren&#x2019;t many bullets left over.</span></p><p><span style="">He was feeling a tremendous fatigue from using Bullet Time.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Tae-hyuk breathed harshly as he waved his hand.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Well, shall we finish our earlier conversation?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;......!&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Anne realized her own misconceptions.</span></p><p><span style="">Phantom wasn&#x2019;t just a hand she could use to keep the other mafia in check.</span></p><p><span style="">He was the &#x2018;king&#x2019; who could change the mafia system itself.</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p>
