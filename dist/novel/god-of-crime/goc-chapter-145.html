<p><span style="">Chapter 145 - War Between Criminals #4</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p><p><span style="">There was a tense atmosphere at Incheon International Airport as dozens of mysterious men, wearing black suits and black sunglasses, exuded a heavy aura.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Whenever the letters on the board changed, their turned their heads in tandem, like a mob of meerkats, to look at it.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;....Those people?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;G-Gangsters?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Aren&#x2019;t they looking this way?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What are the police doing?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The police could issue an eviction order if a group gave off a sense of oppression, but the black suits were standing away from each other, and couldn&#x2019;t be accused of doing anything.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The passengers at the airport looked at the dangerous men in black suits instead of approaching them.</span></p><p><span style="">At that moment, a plane arrived at gate 12.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The atmosphere among the black suited men became tense as the door opened and passengers started to pour out.&#xA0;</span><span style="">One man was visible among them.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He was a sharp-eyed man wearing Chinese clothing.&#xA0;</span><span style="">People started to talk as they saw him.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Who is it? Unbelievably handsome!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes. An actor from China? Look at those clothes.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;...I-I think you should be quiet. The men in black suits are gathering...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The passengers moved away as the men in black suits moved and lined up.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The black suited men bowed towards the person in unison.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Welcome, President-nim!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Li Zheng clicked his tongue as the black suited men greeted him loudly enough for his ears to ring.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was like advertising that the boss of the Triads had come.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He was glad that the muscle-brained people called him &#x2018;President&#x2019; instead of &#x2018;Boss.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">Li Zheng was known as the president of a textile factory.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He used that identity whenever he went abroad.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I clearly said that only a few people should come and pick me up.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;T-That, Phanto...isn&#x2019;t he currently really active? If President-nim receives any damages...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;It is groundless. Even if he is Phantom, there is no way for him to know my identity.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Li Zheng laughed.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was impossible for Phantom to know that he was the boss of the Triads.</span></p><p><span style="">No, in the first place, Li Zheng didn&#x2019;t exist in this world.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He was one of the successors gathered from all across China and eventually made the boss of Huaqing.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He had been able to become the boss after beating many competing successors since his childhood.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Li Zheng was a nickname attached to him because he mainly used a blue club during the trainee days.</span></p><p><span style="">That&#x2019;s why hackers trying to figure out the boss&#x2019; identity couldn&#x2019;t find it.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Even if Phantom had remarkable abilities, he couldn&#x2019;t solve a problem that had no answer.</span></p><p><span style="">Li Zheng beckoned to his men.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Let&#x2019;s go.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The dozens of black suited men started to follow after him.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Phantom had made a symbol of himself and created Phantoms.</span></p><p><span style="">Li Zheng was also a symbol of Huaqing.&#xA0;</span><span style="">So his identity would never be known...</span></p><p><span style="">Li Zheng left the airport to meet his limousine ride.&#xA0;</span><span style="">However, one of the black suited men quickly followed behind him.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He approached so closely that Li Zheng could feel his breaths.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The black suited man brought his mouth to Li Zheng&#x2019;s ears and whispered,</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I don&#x2019;t think that is the case.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;......!&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">The rest of the group yelled with confusion.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;H-Hey! What are you doing? Get away from Boss!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Did you eat something bad yesterday? You looked fine...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;B-Boss-nim... I-I&#x2019;m really sorry. Maybe due to the hot weather...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Walking without thinking and bumping into the boss.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Such rudeness couldn&#x2019;t be forgiven in the organization.&#xA0;</span><span style="">However, the person in question just faced Li Zheng with a firm expression.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Such behaviour could only be forgiven from the bosses of the other divisions.&#xA0;</span><span style="">There were those who put their hands in their pockets like they wanted to blow his head off right away.</span></p><p><span style="">The insane man in the black suit said,</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I want to talk to you for a bit. Didn&#x2019;t you also want to meet with me?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The man slowly took off his sunglasses and placed an opera mask on his face.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Phantom stood in the place where the black suited man was.</span></p><p><span style="">Phantom said,</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Hello, boss of Huaqing, &#x2018;Li Zheng&#x2019;. No, I should say No Name.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;&#x2026;!!!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Li Zheng&apos;s body froze.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He could understand Phantom standing in front of him.</span></p><p><span style="">...But how did he know Li Zheng&#x2019;s identity?&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was absolutely impossible.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Li Zheng was so stunned he thought he was going to pass out.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was the first time he felt like this since he was born.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;It must be quite strange that I know your name.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;H-H-how, that...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk said with a smile,</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Isn&#x2019;t it written on your face?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;......&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">He wasn&#x2019;t telling a joke.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He literally read the opponent&#x2019;s name that was floating in the air.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Of course, this was because because he had Hawk Eyes.</span></p><p><span style="">Three days ago, Phantom had perceived a strange atmosphere as he watched the Triads.&#xA0;</span><span style="">After realizing this, Tae-hyuk disguised himself as a member.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The organization members seemed awfully busy.&#xA0;</span><span style="">They cleaned up and brought in luxury furniture, as if a VIP was coming.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk had seen something similar in the army.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;When the commander visited my unit... The preparation took five weeks for a meeting that only lasted five minutes.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">It meant that someone high-ranking from China was coming.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Therefore, Tae-hyuk joined the welcoming committee.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Surprisingly, it was the boss who they were meeting.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;No Name, unknown. Now I understand why the bosses of the Triads are veiled in secrecy.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">China had the One Child Policy for 35 years.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The second born child of a low income family wouldn&#x2019;t be on the family register and would live a cattle-like life.&#xA0;</span><span style="">They were left to roam the back streets and were often picked up by the criminal organizations.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Among the numerous nameless people who entered, Li Zheng entered up being a boss.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk moved closer to Li Zheng.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The other black suited men couldn&#x2019;t approach and just yelled,</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;G-Get away from Boss!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;You know what? If I wanted to then he would be dead 150 times already.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Ugh!&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk pulled out an invitation and placed it in Li Zheng&#x2019;s pocket with a smile.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;This is a party invitation. Come if you can. I will be holding a very enjoyable game.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;G-Game?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;If you went then I will tell you how I found out your name.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;......!&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Li Zheng&#x2019;s eyes trembled.</span></p><p><span style="">Then he looked down at Phantom&#x2019;s invitation.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The words &#x2018;Mafia Game&#x2019; were written on it.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;You are inviting me to a mafia game?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">There was no answer.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Li Zheng looked around like he had seen a ghost.</span></p><p><span style="">Phantom had already disappeared.</span></p><p><span style="">@</span></p><p><span style="">His men fell down in front of Li Zheng, who was dressed to attend a party, and begged.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;B-Boss! You can&#x2019;t go in there! This place is dangerous. It is clear that Phantom installed a trap!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Li Zheng ignored the request of his loyal subordinates.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;If he was going to kill me, then I would&#x2019;ve crossed the river by now. This invitation obviously means something.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The only thing stated was the name of a hotel lounge.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Li Zheng was one of 13 bosses and a symbol of the Triads, yet he was going directly to a suspicious place like this.&#xA0;</span><span style="">His men had to stop him, even if it cost them their lives.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I understand why you are worried. However, the place mentioned on the invitation is a hotel lounge where many people gather. If he doesn&#x2019;t want to be infamous, then Phantom can&#x2019;t bomb it or go on a shooting spree.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I-It is still dangerous! At the very least, guards...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Of course I will. Phantom didn&#x2019;t stay that I had to come alone.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Huu... Then I will carefully select among our elites.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style=""> &#x201C;Yes.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Time passed quickly and it was the time marked on the invitation.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Li Zheng went to the hotel lounge with nine guards in order to meet Phantom.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The hotel was gorgeous enough to be rated five stars.&#xA0;</span><span style="">But to Li Zheng, who lived surrounded by all types of luxury, it seemed ordinary.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Despite the fact that it was a weekday evening, there were a lot of people in the lounge.</span></p><p><span style="">Li Zheng went to the bar and ordered a martini.&#xA0;</span><span style="">His guards stayed within 10 meters of him.&#xA0;</span><span style="">If they were with him then he could flee no matter what happened.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The guards would protect Li Zheng, even if they died doing so.</span></p><p><span style="">Then the bartender spoke to him,</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Customer-nim, I&#x2019;m sorry but did you come to attend the game?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Li Zheng was baffled.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He wondered if Phantom was disguised as the bartender.&#xA0;</span><span style="">But that didn&#x2019;t seem to be the case.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;That&#x2019;s right.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Oh, I almost forgot. He asked me to deliver this if someone like you entered.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The bartender pulled out a VR machine from a drawer.&#xA0;</span><span style="">There were safety goggles and a machine that allowed someone to see 3D videos, as if one was experiencing it himself.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Hrmm... Who gave this to you?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;He wore a black suit and black sunglasses.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Li Zheng swallowed back his groan.</span></p><p><span style="">It was clearly Phantom.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He searched with a portable detector but didn&#x2019;t see any traces of explosives.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;It doesn&#x2019;t look dangerous.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">In the end, he gulped and placed the VR machine on his face.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The switch was pressed and the recorded video played.</span></p><p><i><span style="">-Hello.</span></i> <i><span style="">Bosses of the Triads, Yakuza and Red Mafia.</span></i></p><p><span style="">&quot;......!&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Li Zheng almost screamed as Phantom&#x2019;s voice flowed into his ears.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He wasn&#x2019;t alone in this place?&#xA0;</span><span style="">As Phantom said, the bosses of the Yakuza and Red Mafia were watching this video somewhere in the lounge.</span></p><p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">There are many surprised expressions.</span></i> <i><span style="">Oh, don&#x2019;t get too excited.</span></i> <i><span style="">You aren&#x2019;t the only ones who brought your men.&#xA0;</span></i><i><span style="">They did as well.</span></i></p><p><span style="">If the bosses of the Yakuza and Red Mafia were here then Li Zheng could use his guards to secure them.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;...Anyway, it is a recorded video. He just wants to imitate a mind-reader.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Li Zheng licked his lips.</span></p><p><span style="">It was the same with Mister Park and Semon.&#xA0;</span><span style="">In fact, most of the people in the lounge were from the mafia.&#xA0;</span><span style="">One wrong move would turn this into a battleground.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was the same as pointing a gun at each other&#x2019;s heads.</span></p><p><span style="">The bosses were forced to focus on Phantom&#x2019;s video.&#xA0;</span><span style="">They would listen to Phantom&#x2019;s message first and decide what to do next.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was the best they could do right now.</span></p><p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">I guess you have some ideas.</span></i> <i><span style="">Then I will tell you why I called the bosses here.</span></i> <i><span style="">Until now, I have gone against all the mafia in South Korea.</span></i> <i><span style="">But I&#x2019;m feeling a little weak.</span></i> <i><span style="">I think I should hold hands with one side.</span></i></p><p><span style="">Li Zheng gulped.</span></p><p><span style="">Phantom had been dealing with the mafia alone.&#xA0;</span><span style="">What would happen if he joined hands with one of them?&#xA0;</span><span style="">Then they would dominate.</span></p><p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">Now, now.</span></i> <i><span style="">This is a reminder that it is a joyous celebration.</span></i> <i><span style="">One week from now.</span></i> <i><span style="">I will prepare a stage where we can all play games happily.</span></i> <i><span style="">Then I will hold hands with the victor.</span></i> <i><span style="">How about it?</span></i> <i><span style="">Simple isn&apos;t it?</span></i></p><p><i><span style="">Of course, some people will have a grudge against me.</span></i> <i><span style="">I&#x2019;ll give them my head.</span></i> <i><span style="">If you want me strength then that is good.</span></i> <i><span style="">Of course, I can also get married.</span></i> <i><span style="">In other words, Phantom himself is the prize.</span></i> <i><span style="">Now, how about it?</span></i> <i><span style="">Are you getting interested?</span></i></p><p><span style="">&quot;......!&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Everybody&#x2019;s eyes flashed at the contents.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Playing the mafia game that Phantom created?&#xA0;</span><span style="">If they won then Phantom was the prize.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It wasn&#x2019;t just at the level of holding hands since he said he would give them his life.</span></p><p><span style="">Li Zheng had something he wanted to ask.&#xA0;</span><span style="">To do that, he had to win the mafia game.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Of course, he would cut off Phantom&#x2019;s head after receiving the answer.&#xA0;</span><span style="">After all, he had killed plenty of his own subordinates.</span></p><p><span style="">Mister Park smiled.&#xA0;</span><span style="">This was the stage for him.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Getting Phantom meant that he could rule South Korea.&#xA0;</span><span style="">No, he could get more if Phantom&#x2019;s abilities were added.</span></p><p><span style="">Caterina&#x2019;s face turned red.&#xA0;</span><span style="">If she won the game, then he would marry her?&#xA0;</span><span style="">To do that, she had to compete with the other bosses.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Her life itself was a struggle.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was natural to fight to get what she wanted.</span></p><p><span style="">In the end, the bosses all came to the same conclusion.&#xA0;</span><span style="">They would attend the mafia game!</span></p><p><span style="">And...</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x201C;&#x201C;I must acquire Phantom...!&#x201D;&#x201D;&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Thus, the mafia bosses made their decisions and their fighting spirits blazed.</span></p><p><span style="">@</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2015;Of course, victory is mine.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk smiled and listed out the conditions to participate in the mafia game.</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p>
