<p><span style="">Chapter 66 - Bomber #4 &#xA0;</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p><p><span style="">&quot;I&#x2019;ve been running around Seoul all day...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk muttered as he stared at Samilmun. (</span><span style="">TN: A large gate that is a the entrance to a park&#xA0;in Korea. Named after the <a href="en.wikipedia.org">March 1st Movement</a>, one of the earliest displays of resistance during the ruling of Korea by Japan)</span></p><p><span style="">The fourth bomb was installed in Tapgol Park, Jongno-gu, Seoul.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The hint mentioned a park and the 3.1 movement, so it wasn&#x2019;t too hard to locate.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The problem was the rest of the situation.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The sun had gone down while he was running hard.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Perhaps this would be the last bomb installed today.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ah really. Once I make enough money then I should buy a car.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Then Tae-hyuk scratched his head as he thought of something.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ah. That reminds me, I don&#x2019;t even have my license yet.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Of course, if he needed a license then he could make it with the Counterfeit skill.&#xA0;</span><span style="">However, public transportation such as the bus and subway was still comfortable.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He was a citizen.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk recalled the contents of the phone call that he made before.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It stated that the contact person had changed to Cho Kang-suk, and that there would be a reward if he cooperated in finding the bombs.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I didn&#x2019;t think they would give the money so obediently. Still, it is strange.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk licked his lips.</span></p><p><span style="">By the way, Cho Kang-suk would be in charge of him, which wasn&#x2019;t entirely unexpected.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It seemed like there was more confidence in him than Tae-hyuk thought.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It wasn&#x2019;t bad for Tae-hyuk if Cho Kang-suk was in a higher position.&#xA0;</span><span style="">If he kept stacking up merits like this, wouldn&#x2019;t it be easy for him to eventually become the commissioner?</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;That should be enough for Noona. That reminds me, I have to prepare for their second date.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">He had planned something great for both of them, but it ended up not working.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Kang-suk had received a call during the visit to the planetarium and had to go to work while wearing a suit.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was a sad day that allowed them to feel the woes of an ordinary worker.</span></p><p><span style="">In the end, Tae-hyuk and Ha-ran went to the luxurious restaurant that was reserved.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Ha-ran had enjoyed spending time with her younger brother after a long time.&#xA0;</span><span style="">However, Tae-hyuk had to spend 300,000 won for the meal, so he didn&#x2019;t know if the food would enter his mouth or his nose.</span></p><p><span style="">Anyway, Tae-hyuk had decided to produce the second date.</span></p><p><span style="">The bomb would be hidden some place to the right after entering through Samilmun.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The December evening was so cold that he couldn&#x2019;t prevent the coat even with a thick coat.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Therefore, there were barely any people walking in the park.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Even if an explosion occurred here, the damage wouldn&#x2019;t be so great.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk wondered if there were any witnesses around and triggered the Spying skill.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He could feel some unseen eyes.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He had invested a great deal of affinity points to escape from Atlantis, and now it was possible to check the status and belongings of other people in a wider range.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hrmm... There is a cleaner with a broom.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">It felt like observing the surroundings through radar.&#xA0;</span><span style="">However, he couldn&#x2019;t use it often due to the serious stamina exhaustion.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Wait a minute. Cleaner...?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk suddenly realized a strange point.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He took out his phone and checked the time.</span></p><p><span style="">6:30 p.m.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was long past the work hours.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Cleaners were people who were sensitive to work hours due to it being an occupation that involved their bodies.&#xA0;</span><span style="">But this cleaner was staying up late to work?&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was strange.</span></p><p><span style="">This was a place where the bomb was installed, further heightening his suspicions.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk scratched his head. </span></p><p><span style="">Originally, the hidden bomb was supposed to be found at H High School around 10 tonight.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Tapgol Park was tomorrow at dawn.&#xA0;</span><span style="">One of the biggest disadvantages of the liquid bomb was that it didn&#x2019;t perform well as a timer bomb.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Therefore, a specially made storage contained was needed to delay freezing as much as possible.&#xA0;</span><span style="">But that had a limit of half a day.</span></p><p><span style="">&apos;In other words, Kim Tae-sung predicted the time that the bomb would be found and set up the next bomb.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">He was a man with a very good mind, and had obviously calculated everything when he started this.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The search of all schools in Seoul was also an operation to buy time.</span></p><p><span style="">But there was something Kim Tae-sung couldn&#x2019;t think of, which was the presence of Seo Tae-hyuk.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was the same as playing a Minesweeper game while knowing the correct answer.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk arrived at the place where the next bomb would be installed much faster than Kim Tae-sung anticipated.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Maybe it wasn&#x2019;t a bomb but the Bomber hunt.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk laughed.</span></p><p><span style="">It saved like he would be giving a present to the police officers suffering in this cold weather.</span></p><p><span style="">@</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;You must have suffered in this cold.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk handed a warm can of coffee to the cleaner having a hard time in this cold weather.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Aigoo. Of course not, it&#x2019;s my job. Thanks, I really appreciate this.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The cleaner was a man in his 50s with wrinkles around his eyes, indicating that he smiled a lot.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The two men sat down on a bench and looked up at the moon in the sky.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The cleaner grabbed the can of coffee with both hands and carefully raised it to his mouth before saying in an excellent voice.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;On nights with a bright moon like this, I think of my daughter.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Your daughter likes the moon?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The cleaner replied with a look that said he was locked in his memories.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes. When my wife had my child, I saw a big moon in my dream. Therefore, I named her Sang-ah (Ivory).&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Oh, isn&#x2019;t she the goddess of the moon from Chinese mythology?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes, also known as Heng&#x2019;e. So she really liked the moon. She said she wanted to go there one day. Her dream was to become an astronaut.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span><span style="">(TN: The common name in Chinese mythology is Chang&#x2019;e)</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk asked a question that was necessary when hearing old stories.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;So what happened?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The janitor smiled wanly.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;In the end, she went to the moon, along with her mother.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;So why didn&#x2019;t you go with them?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The cleaner made a serious expression and sighed.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He was locked in his thoughts.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Was he remembering his happy days with his family?</span></p><p><span style="">A long time passed.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Once the hot can of coffee became cold, the firmly closed mouth finally opened.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I still have work to do.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk gulped down his cold coffee and said with a smile.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;It was nice meeting you, Kim Tae-sung. I&#x2019;ve heard your story well.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Kim Tae-sung&#x2019;s eyes widened. His expression seemed to ask how Tae-hyuk knew his name.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Tae-hyuk stepped on the can he was drinking and said.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I would like to send you to the moon where your daughter is. Well, I don&#x2019;t have enough ability. At best, I can only show you the stars.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Huh? A-All of a sudden...?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">[You have activated the Violence skill.]</span></p><p><span style="">-Muscle strength and agility are strengthened.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk swung the iron pipe made by the Violence skill and hit Kim Tae-sung&#x2019;s head.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Keok...!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Kim Tae-sung collapsed at the unexpected attack.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ouch... I thought I would die from the cold. Why was the introduction so long?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk checked the status of Kim Tae-sung who was collapsed on the bench.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He controlled his power but it seemed like Kim Tae-sung would be out for a while.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Perhaps it would be a few hours before he opened his eyes.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Once he wakes up, he will be panicked to see a strange ceiling.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk took off the glasses he was wearing.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He also tore off the beard that he had put on his chin.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was a disguise but he looked quite funny.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk also covered his head with a beanie so he wouldn&#x2019;t leave any traces behind.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Then he took out surgical gloves.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Once everything was ready, Tae-hyuk started to check Kim Tae-sung&#x2019;s belongings.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Oh, the tape recorder is found.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The recorded tape was in the pocket of the clothes.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The content was a riddle about the location of the next bomb, which was found in a garbage-carrying cart.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The effect of the intimidation would fall if he didn&#x2019;t back it up.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;Indeed, there is also a primer this time.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk smiled bitterly after confirming that his memories were correct.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Tae-hyuk tied up Kim Tae-sung&#x2019;s body after attaching the evidence with gum tape.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;It is cold outside, so you might catch a cold. I&#x2019;ll have someone come pick you up quickly.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">In the end, the bomber Kim Tae-sung had made the whole country move for 120 hours with his bombs.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Tae-hyuk had stopped him after 20 hours.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk pulled out Yoo Ha-yang&#x2019;s phone from his pocket, which allowed him to make calls without having his position traced.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Of course, she had to be a night owl for that to happen.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I&apos;m sorry, but this time the criminal is caught so it is a happy ending! ...Please do this.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Kim Tae-sung could be called a material to be traded.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Until now, Tae-hyuk was only concerned about catching criminals.</span></p><p><span style="">Then he could get new skills or affinity points.&#xA0;</span><span style="">However, even though he met new criminals after the hippo case, he didn&#x2019;t get their skills.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The reason was probably Tae-hyuk&#x2019;s low rating.</span></p><p><span style="">If so, he needed to at least make money.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Tae-hyuk saw a serious deficit from the Death Circus case.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Ohh... I once had three billion won in my hands.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">Of course, it was nothing.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Even if he came out of the Death Circus with it, Choi Sung-yeol wouldn&#x2019;t have paid him any money.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was a bourgeois game played with fake money.</span></p><p><span style="">But now it was different.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He now had a route to get money.&#xA0;</span><span style="">From now on, he had to move really carefully.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Then shall I finish this Bomber case?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The police were trying to catch the Bomber.&#xA0;</span><span style="">However, they had no idea that Tae-hyuk had already caught him.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk made called Kim Do-shik&#x2019;s phone.&#xA0;</span><span style="">But it would probably be Cho Kang-suk who picked up.</span></p><p><span style="">&apos;It feels strange to deceive Hyung. Hyung, please excuse me for Noona&#x2019;s sake.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">Then the call was connected.</span></p><p><span style="">@</span></p><p><span style="">The call arrived.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Joo Hyun-ho was filled with embarrassment.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Uhh, has he solved the problem already? Damn! What? What the hell is going on in that head?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">He had been reading all types of history books for an hour, starting with Romance of the Three Kingdoms.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was to solve the riddle left behind by the Bomber.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He knew the outline to a certain extent so he could get the answer in 10 minutes.&#xA0;</span><span style="">But the God of Crime had called.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Joo Hyun-ho kicked the ground.</span></p><p><span style="">Cho Kang-suk was in charge of contact with the God of Crime.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He was speaking with a serious expression.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Once the call ended, Kim Do-shik asked.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Detective Cho! What did you find out? Did he tell you where the next bomb is?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Cho Kang-suk made a difficult expression.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;That... It isn&#x2019;t it. He didn&#x2019;t find the bomb.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Aigoo. Then what? He called because he was bored?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Joo Hyun-ho, who had been listening to the conversation between Kim Do-shik and Cho Kang-suk, jumped in.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Haha! I thought so. This problem isn&#x2019;t easily solved! Please wait a moment. I will definitely solve the problem faster than the God of Crime!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Cho Kang-suk burst out laughing.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;That... He found the Bomber, not the bomb.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Eh?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Ehh?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The people who heard him shrieked.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What? Really?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes. He really called about that. The Bomber is caught.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;W-Where?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Tapgol Park.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Joo Hyun-ho shrieked.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ah! 3.1, March 1st movement! Damn... Why didn&apos;t I think of that before?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Cho Kang-suk and Kim Do-shik ignored Joo Hyun-ho, who was running around with an upset expression.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Then what are you going to do? Will you really give him money?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;If he really caught the Bomber then yes. It is a promise.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;150 million...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;But I still can&#x2019;t deny that the Bomber and God of Crime might be accomplices. So I&#x2019;d like to hold both of them. Therefore, I put a mini transmitter in the money bag. The National Intelligence Service is assisting.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Cho Kang-suk&#x2019;s eyes widened.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Are you going to catch the God of Crime?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes. Then I will see what tricks he used. Detective Cho, aren&#x2019;t you curious?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Kim Do-shik&#x2019;s eyes flashed.</span></p><p><span style="">His senses, developed from over 30 years as a police officer, told him something.&#xA0;</span><span style="">They told him that the Bomber was nothing compared to the God of Crime.</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p>
