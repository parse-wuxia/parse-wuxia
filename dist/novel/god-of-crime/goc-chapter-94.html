<p>Chapter 94 - Big Brother&#x2019;s Raid #5</p><p></p><hr><p></p><p><span style="">The encounter with a killer who possessed overwhelming violence evolved Tae-hyuk&#x2019;s crime skill.</span></p><p><span style="">[A new attribute has been added to Crime Skill: Violence.] </span></p><p><span style="">[&#x2019;Damage to Both Sides&#x2019; has been acquired.]</span></p><p><span style="">[An attack on your opponent will also damage you.]</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk inwardly groaned as he looked at the message on the Demon Revealing Mirror.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Hrmm... Something....&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">Unlike the other attributes he had gained so far, the performance was quite ambiguous.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The good news was that it was possible to turn it on and off.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Eh? Wait a minute. Can I designate the opponent?&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk&#x2019;s eyes gleamed as he discovered an additional explanation at the bottom.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Then the story was different. </span><span style="">If Damage to Both Sides was used, doing damage to one person would inflict it on the other.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The scale was exactly 5:5.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was an attribute that would increase the use of the Violence skill if used well.</span></p><p><span style="">&apos;But in order to damage the other person, the conditions have to be satisfied?&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk manipulated the Demon Revealing Mirror to check what the conditions were, and then licked his lips.</span></p><p><span style="">&apos;Cancel what I said about this being useful... What, these conditions are crazy.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">While Tae-hyuk was looking at the new attribute, Big Brother had completely broken the mirror.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Phantom&#x2019;s provocation seemed better than he thought.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Then Big Brother started to unleash his anger on the hostages.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Kid. I said that I would spare you sister if you shot yourself in the belly? That is cancelled. If you want to complain, blame Phantom.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Big Brother&#x2019;s eyes were full of madness.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It wouldn&#x2019;t be strange if he killed all the hostages right now.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Min Soo-young wept and clung to his leg.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;...P-Please, s-spare... I-I will die. R-Right now...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Then she pulled up her clothes and revealed her belly.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Big Brother looked at her in surprise.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It seemed like she really would kill herself.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was a very interesting situation for him since the sacrifice was nothing but hypocrisy.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He would have been able to play more if it wasn&#x2019;t for Phantom.</span></p><p><span style="">Big Brother kicked Min Soo-young&#x2019;s belly like it was annoying.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Her body curved like a bow and a sharp scream emerged, but this wasn&#x2019;t the end.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Big Brother grabbed her head and slammed it against the floor.&#xA0;</span><span style="">There was a cracking sound and blood rushed out from Min Soo-young&#x2019;s nose.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Keeok, augh... Keook...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes. I&#x2019;ve just come up with a good idea. I will give you the pleasure of killing your sister directly.</span></p><p><span style="">Min Soo-young tried to somehow save her sister.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Therefore, she didn&#x2019;t release the gun in her hand even when she was kicked and her face slammed against the ground.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Big Brother grabbed Min Soo-young&#x2019;s shoulder firmly so that she couldn&#x2019;t resist.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The other hand grabbed her right arm that was holding the pistol.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Then he slowly turned the muzzle towards her little sister.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ah... No, do...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Min Soo-young tried desperately to resist but her body didn&#x2019;t budge.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;U-Unni...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">In the end, the muzzle arrived directly in front of Min Soo-yeon.&#xA0;</span><span style="">If she pulled the trigger, then her sister&#x2019;s life would be taken.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Uwah... Euh...!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Min Soo-young finally gave up resisting and closed her eyes.&#xA0;</span><span style="">She didn&#x2019;t want to see her sister dying in front of her.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Aigoo. You shouldn&#x2019;t miss something this good.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">But Big Brother was persistent to the end.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He forced open Min Soo-young&#x2019;s eyes so that the sight in front of her would be imprinted.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Now. Pull this and there will be a very impressive scene. Don&#x2019;t worry. You will soon follow your little sister.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Big Brother put his finger on the trigger and pulled.</span></p><p><i><span style="">Tatang!</span></i></p><p><span style="">The bullet fired from the muzzle struck the wall above Soo-yeon&#x2019;s head.&#xA0;</span><span style="">What, did she avoid the attack just now?</span></p><p><span style="">Big Brother glared at the man who had pushed Soo-yeon out of the way.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He was the only one who knew what that person did.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He mixed in with the hostages and popped out like lightning when the trigger was pulled and kicked Min Soo-yeon&#x2019;s legs, making her fall to the ground.&#xA0;</span><span style="">As a result, she was bleeding from the nose like her sister, but she was able to avoid being shot.</span></p><p><span style="">Big Brother looked at the man with a strange expression.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;What, this guy?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">If the other person&#x2019;s response was too early, then Big Brother would&#x2019;ve seen it and changed the direction of the muzzle.&#xA0;</span><span style="">If he was too late, then the girl&#x2019;s head would literally be like a cracked watermelon.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was impossible for a human to react that fast when a bullet was shot.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hrmm... How did you notice the moment of attack?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Min Soo-young&#x2019;s gun was loaded with 5.56mm bullets that had a speed of 945 meters per second.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was a tremendous speed that was three times the speed of sound.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was normal for the head to already burst the moment the firing sound was heard.</span></p><p><span style="">That meant the other person knew exactly when he was shooting.&#xA0;</span><span style="">But was that possible?&#xA0;</span><span style="">Big Brother looked at the opponent like he had seen a magic trick.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;You are the one who was with Shin Se-ho.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">He was the one who urinated himself after being threatened with a few bullets.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Therefore, it must just be a coincidence.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;It is funny. Very funny! Kuhaha! You made me feel very amused!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">He was lucky with the first bullet, but Big Brother still had many bullets remaining.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Even if he shot everyone here 10 times, he would still have some left.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Big Brother laughed crazily and aimed the muzzle again at Min Soo-yeon who was rolling on the ground.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Let&#x2019;s see if you can avoid it again this time. Of course, such a coincidence won&#x2019;t be repeated twice.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">He had protected his body with a specially made reinforced suit.&#xA0;</span><span style="">In such a situation, murdering other people gave him a pleasure which couldn&#x2019;t be explained by words.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;But what are you going to do after killing everyone here?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;What?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Big Brother thought he heard wrong for a moment.&#xA0;</span><span style="">That crazy bastard was making strange noises as he was staring straight into Big Brother&#x2019;s eyes.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;There are many police officers outside who are trying to save the hostages. If the hostages are alive then there is a possibility of escape. But that will change if they are all dead. So how are you doing to run away?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Huhuhu... A rat is worried about a cat. If you have questions, then I&#x2019;ll let you know in the afterlife. At the very least, you should know why you died. I came here to catch the Phantom. Well, do you already know that much? Whether successful or not, a helicopter is going to pick me up.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;That is great, but what should I do? I blew up your rescue helicopter.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;The pilot&#x2019;s name is Wei Chang.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;This bastard... How do you know that?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The bastard put his hand into his clothes and pulled out something white.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Phantom mask? D-Don&#x2019;t tell me...!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Do I still look like your hostage?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The confused Big Brother slowly counted the number of hostages.&#xA0;</span><span style="">There were 30 people, and he killed 11 rebellious ones, so 19 people should be remaining.&#xA0;</span><span style="">But no matter how much he counted, the number remained the same.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;2-20?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I told you. I came here to kill you.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The bastard who put on the mask was Phantom.</span></p><p><span style="">@</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Kuhahahaha! You walked in here of your own volition.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Big Brother picked up the submachine gun that he had left in the corner.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was the German-made MP5 that boasted high precision and reliability. It was used in numerous special forces and counter-terrorist units since the 1970s.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Most of them were retired and disappeared into history, but they were still active in the mafia.</span></p><p><span style="">The incredible capacity to fire 800 shots per minute meant that it couldn&#x2019;t even be compared to a pistol.&#xA0;</span><span style="">There were 30 bullets in 6 cartridges, too much just to kill one person.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The whole body would turn into a bloody mess.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk told the hostages to gather in one corner of the room.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;If you don&#x2019;t want to be killed by blind bullets then you should all fall to the ground.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Uack, aaaaack!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The hostages screamed and fell to the ground.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;It seems like you are planning something interesting, but let&#x2019;s see if you can survive the first hail of bullets.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">[Violence has been used.]</span></p><p><span style="">-An iron pipe is equipped.</span></p><p><span style="">Big Brother pulled the trigger of the MP5.</span></p><p><i><span style="">Dududududu!</span></i></p><p><span style="">In an instant, 30 bullets fired towards Tae-hyuk as the magazine became completely empty.</span></p><p><span style="">[Sixth Sense has been used.]</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;I see the attacks!&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">Sixth Sense allowed Tae-hyuk to feel where the attacks were coming from.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The trajectory of the bullets became a red line in the air.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What? B-Blood?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Big Brother stared at Tae-hyuk.</span></p><p><span style="">Violence allowed him to increase his strength and agility by a certain extent.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The higher his stats, the greater the increase.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Tae-hyuk currently had 50 agility.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Since it was amplified, it was possible for him to move beyond human limits.</span></p><p><span style="">However, the power of the submachine gun was also enormous.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Even with the help of Violence, he couldn&#x2019;t avoid all bullets.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Tae-hyuk&#x2019;s shoulders and thighs were soaked with blood.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;You are confidently barging in. However, you should realize that you can&#x2019;t hurt me just by avoiding those bullets.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Big Brother said,</span></p><p><span style="">He used all the abilities of Violence, but it was just to avoid the opponent&#x2019;s attacks.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The first one to succumb in the end would be Tae-hyuk.&#xA0;</span><span style="">However, Tae-hyuk was still smiling with a relaxed face.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Checkmate.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">In no time, Tae-hyuk had reached closed enough to stretch out and touch Big Brother&#x2019;s body.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hahat! I don&#x2019;t know what construction site you picked up that pipe at. However, you won&#x2019;t be able to hurt me with it.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Big Brother wore a reinforced suit that even blocked bullets.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;But I can touch you at this distance.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk struck Big Brother&#x2019;s shoulder like he was a quarterback.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Kuahaha! You approached me to do this. It is an attack like a mosquito!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Now the armour protecting you has disappeared.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk said and Hyung-nim looked down at his body,</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;N-No?!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The reinforced suit he had been wearing had disappeared.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Tae-hyuk threw Big Brother&#x2019;s reinforced suit, that he had taken with Robbery, into the corner.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Now let&#x2019;s try this.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Then he struck Big Brother with the iron pipe.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was a blow with enough power to shatter asphalt at once.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I don&#x2019;t know what you did to take off my reinforced suit, but I wouldn&#x2019;t be a killer of the Triads if I relied on body armour.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">His strike didn&#x2019;t work.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Big Brother grabbed the iron pipe with his right arm and lifted it.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;It looks like this time it is my checkmate.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Keuk...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk groaned.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Big Brother smiled with satisfaction.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Instead of the sub-machine gun, he pulled out a familiar handgun and pointed it at Tae-hyuk&#x2019;s head.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Now, say your last words.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">If he pulled the trigger now, the opponent&#x2019;s head will smash along with the phantom mask.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Tae-hyuk spoke in a calm voice, even with the muzzle touching his head.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Is there someone you are willing to risk your life to save?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What are you saying? Did you finally going crazy? Either way, it doesn&#x2019;t matter. I don&apos;t have such a person. The most important thing in this world is my own life.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Then now it is time to feel the pain that the people who died by your hands felt.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Is that the end? Well, goodbye Phantom.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Big Brother pulled the trigger.</span></p><p><i><span style="">Tang!</span></i></p><p><span style="">The phantom mask was destroyed.</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p>
