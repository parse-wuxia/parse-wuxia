<p><span style="">Chapter 51 - Death Circus #2</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p><p><span style="">&apos;The performance is clearly good... But no matter how I think about it, I picked a losing ticket.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk checked the crime skill while An Eun-jeong was taking a break.</span></p><p><span style="">He had invested 10 affinity points to receive a random skill.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The ability that emerged was Counterfeit, a skill that was similar to the Forgery skill that he already had.&#xA0;</span><span style="">However, there was a crucial difference between the two skills.</span></p><p><span style="">First of all, he didn&#x2019;t need to make anything with the Counterfeit skill.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Forgery was basically making something that already existed, and materials were needed to activate the ability.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The more he knew about the original, the more complete the result.</span></p><p><span style="">Counterfeit was a skill that made something look different.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He cut a piece of paper that was 154x68 mm and activated the Counterfeit skill, giving birth to a counterfeit bill of money.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk laughed.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;It is a big hit up to here...&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">He had yelled with joy when he first saw the skill description.&#xA0;</span><span style="">A perfect fake!&#xA0;</span><span style="">If he used it well, then he could get a tremendous amount of wealth.</span></p><p><span style="">However, there was a problem.&#xA0;</span><span style="">There were a few constraints on the Counterfeit skill.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;... First, the duration.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">He could make a counterfeit bill with the skill, making it look like ordinary money.</span></p><p><span style="">The holograms and ink were perfectly converted, and there were even many anti-fake devices included on the bill, such as hidden images.&#xA0;</span><span style="">In addition, it was fluorescent when looked at through an X-ray.&#xA0;</span><span style="">All counterfeit money makers would want his method of production.</span></p><p><span style="">However, once it left Tae-hyuk&#x2019;s hands, it would return to its original state after five minutes.&#xA0;</span><span style="">So no matter how perfect the counterfeit money, he couldn&#x2019;t even use it to buy a pack of gum.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Furthermore, there was a limit to how many times he could use the skill. He couldn&#x2019;t use it often, like he did with Gambling.</span></p><p><span style="">&apos;But it is the best skill to deceive a person in front of me.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk had perfectly tricked Cha Soo-hyun using the Counterfeit skill.</span></p><p><span style="">The method was simple.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Tae-hyuk first received the badge from An Eun-jeong and transferred all the money to his badge.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Then, he used An Eun-jeong&#x2019;s blank badge to create a fake badge with the number 115 on it.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He used Robbery to take away the opponent&#x2019;s badge and agreed to transfer the money.</span></p><p><span style="">Cha Soo-hyun was covering his badge with a thick coat because he was reluctant to reveal his name and current revenue.&#xA0;</span><span style="">That ended up choking him.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He never noticed the important moment when his badge was stolen.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk had acted the part of a boyfriend until the end.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The result was a complete success.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Isn&#x2019;t it a surprisingly usable skill? But X-ray Vision...&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk kept lamenting about his missed opportunities to obtain X-ray Vision.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk looked at Eun-jeong who had been sitting on the table for 10 minutes.&#xA0;</span><span style="">She didn&#x2019;t do it directly, but she had cooperated in deceiving someone.&#xA0;</span><span style="">She seemed to have received a psychological shock.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk exclaimed like he suddenly thought of something.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Ah right. That reminds me, Noona&#x2019;s badge should have melted with Cha Soo-hyun by now. But I don&#x2019;t want to give you the money I borrowed. Then if Noona isn&#x2019;t next to me, then you can&#x2019;t pay the fee.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Eun-jeong flinched at his words.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was a fact that Tae-hyuk hadn&#x2019;t mentioned 20 minutes ago.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;......&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Eun-jeong understood the point that Tae-hyuk wanted to make.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Her life was now in Tae-hyuk&#x2019;s hands.&#xA0;</span><span style="">If she did anything that was even a little annoying...</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I think that is enough rest. Would you like to gain some money? I have to pay for two people so I need to get 200 million won in an hour.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026; Yes, I understand.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Then I will be going to Bluff Poker.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk turned and started to check the map.&#xA0;</span><span style="">An Eun-jeong had goose bumps as she looked at his back.</span></p><p><span style="">The man called Lee Cheol-su felt worse than any criminal that she had ever met.</span></p><p><span style="">@</span></p><p><span style="">The atmosphere permeating throughout the room was not dissimilar to one of a masquerade ball.&#xA0;</span><span style="">There were brightly shining chandeliers.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The tables were filled with a variety of luxury foods.</span></p><p><span style="">Many guests dressed in colourful clothes were laughing.&#xA0;</span><span style="">They wore a wide variety of masks.</span></p><p><span style="">A woman in an opera mask asked,</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Who will survive this time?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Then a tuxedo wearing man with a lion mask replied,</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;This stage has a small number of general participants and many wolves.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">They were told that the wolves were experts in various fields that were prepared by the organizers.&#xA0;</span><span style="">They were hidden among the general participants.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;How many people have fallen into the pool?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Five people.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Omo, omo! Then it will just be a one-sided massacre!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The reaction of the opera mask was natural. Wolves had experienced the Death Circus several times.&#xA0;</span><span style="">If the general participants competed with them then it would just be a one-sided massacre.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Yes. Do they know how much money we spent for this one night? There shouldn&#x2019;t be more than two wolves.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The lion mask sat on a chair and yawned like he was bored.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Dozens of monitors were showing the Death Circus at the party.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The crowd was gathered here to watch the Death Circus.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The opera mask said with a sigh,</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I guess it can&#x2019;t be helped. I wanted to see a fierce fight for survival... Today I just have to drink champagne while listening to the dying screams.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Well, I don&apos;t dislike that either. Haha!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The Death Circus was a very enjoyable spectacle.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Humans killing humans. They questioned each other and took away what the person had.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was a primitive pleasure that couldn&#x2019;t often be enjoyed.</span></p><p><span style="">They couldn&#x2019;t help but admire Kim Joon-young&#x2019;s attractions.&#xA0;</span><span style="">They could see such a fun show, a privilege of the select few.</span></p><p><span style="">The opera mask and lion mask drank champagne while listening to the screams, not even bothering to watch the monitors.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Then someone said,</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Uh, there was a tremendous ruckus right now. Is it okay not to watch it?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The lion mask turned his gaze towards where the voice was heard.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was a young woman wearing a butterfly mask.&#xA0;</span><span style="">She was in her early 20s or so?&#xA0;</span><span style="">Long hair fell to her waist and her dress exposed her chest and shoulders.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;A butterfly...?&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ahaha. Is the mask cute? It is one of my favourites.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The butterfly mask saw that the lion mask was in his 50s.&#xA0;</span><span style="">However, that was the extent of information that was allowed to her by his mask.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He wasn&#x2019;t a CEO in his 50s, but a person wearing a lion mask.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Um. Well, it looks good.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The lion mask looked at the face, where the butterfly mask only covered the eyes.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The reason that guests wore masks was to hide their identity.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Visiting the Death Circus wasn&#x2019;t a hobby that they could talk about proudly, which was why it was necessary to cover their faces.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was even more enjoyable if they could visit a place where they felt like extraordinary existences.</span></p><p><span style="">Kim Joon-young created a party that borrowed from a masquerade ball.&#xA0;</span><span style="">There was no problem seeing the other people in masks.</span></p><p><span style="">Chaebols made up 0.1% of the population of South Korea.&#xA0;</span><span style="">They often knew who a person was by the voice or shape of the body.&#xA0;</span><span style="">In such cases, they pretended not to know the other person, and called them by the name of the mask they were wearing.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was a type of tacit rule.</span></p><p><span style="">The Death Circus had been going on successfully for two years.&#xA0;</span><span style="">However, this was the first time that a person had worn a butterfly mask that barely covered their face.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Wasn&#x2019;t it the same as going unmasked?</span></p><p><span style="">The lion mask looked at the appearance of the butterfly mask.&#xA0;</span><span style="">She was a considerable beauty. In addition, her chest was big. It seemed like she could be an idol singer right now.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Um. This is a big deal. Was there such a young girl?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The lion masked person laughed. Unknowingly, he started trying to figure out the identity of the butterfly mask.&#xA0;</span><span style="">This was a place where it wasn&#x2019;t necessary. He could just refer to the person by the name of the mask and leave it to his desires.</span></p><p><span style="">The lion masked asked with a confused expression.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;A ruckus? What&#x2019;s going on?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">He had been a member of the Death Circus from the beginning, and had seen countless situations that could be considered extreme.</span></p><p><span style="">A young lady brutally killing others.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Someone embracing the person who betrayed them, and jumping into the acid pool together.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Numerous incidents remained in lion mask&#x2019;s memory.</span></p><p><span style="">But a ruckus?&#xA0;</span><span style="">No one would be surprised if a wolf was about to eat.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;The sheep ate the wolf. It was a great scene!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;W-What?!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The lion mask woke up.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Such a momentous occasion had happened while he was drinking champagne?</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;W-Who?! No, did they win by chance? Still, a sheep can&#x2019;t beat a wolf!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Butterfly mask laughed smugly.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Unfortunately, it wasn&#x2019;t recorded.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;S-Sob!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">He had missed such a great scene.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The lion mask groaned unpleasantly.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Is it that disappointing?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I-It is natural. A sheep ate the wolf. This is the first time that it has happened in two years.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;There is still a lot of time left before closing, so do you want to watch it now?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The lion mask shook his head.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;No, this is a miracle that won&#x2019;t happen again. They are going against pros. The miracle that allows ordinary people to win won&#x2019;t come easily.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Is that really the case?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Well, it&#x2019;s a good bet that the sheep will die. Butterfly Mask, do you know the name of the sheep?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Of course. Tae... No, Cheol-su.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hahat! Cheol-su? That is a name that appeared in a Korean book. Yes. I have to see how long he lasts.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The lion mask slowly walked to the monitor and searched for Lee Cheol-su.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He was playing poker with someone at the table.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The lion mask saw the face of the opponent and laughed.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Haha. This is interesting. Is this the revenge of the wolves?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The sheep Cheol-su was confronting another wolf.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;He has bad luck. I never imagined that he would meet two wolves consecutively.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Then the butterfly mask said.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Isn&#x2019;t the sheep winning?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The lion mask&#x2019;s eyes widened and he looked at the monitor.</span></p><p><span style="">He didn&#x2019;t see the moment that the first miracle happened.&#xA0;</span><span style="">However, he saw the second one.</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p>
