That day is here. It will happen in one week.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Tae-hyuk&#x2019;s eyes&#xA0;</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">violently trembled</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">A moan e</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">scap</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">ed from his tightly closed mouth. The last 10 years. He had thought that all his emotions had weathered away.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Your claims of innocence have flown away. Your lawyer has run away. In the end...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;It is like this.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">The guard held out some documents.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;What is it?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;Write down the&#xA0;</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">meal</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#xA0;that you would like to have on your last night. If you also have anyone you wish to visit then write it down as well.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">It was the so-called last dinner and last visit.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Tae-hyuk did nothing for one minute. However, his head was filled with thoughts of his life.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">He slowly filled out the documents.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;Hoh. Kimchi stew.

Now, he was doing to die without seeing anything.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">The guard had a strange thought that he found amusing.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Ah. I thought of something. Isn&#x2019;t a criminal who receives a life sentence called the king of crime? Then what should I call a criminal who is going to be executed</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">?</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#xA0;Perhaps</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">,</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">a</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#xA0;god</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">?</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#xA0;Haha!

He was waiting for his&#xA0;</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">younger brother and older sister,</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#xA0;who he had asked to visit. It had already been over a year since he last saw them.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">What would they talk about? He wanted to thank his younger brother for believing that he was innocent until the end.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Did his sister, who took over as a mother when their parents died when he was a child, live happily every after?</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Tae-hyuk looked at the clock on the wall. The kimchi stew on the table was already cold.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt"><em>Thump.</em></span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Tae-hyuk tried to make his expression as casual as possible as he heard the door opening.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;......&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Tae-hyuk&#xA0;</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">forgot</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#xA0;what he was going to say when he saw the person who came in.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Aigoo, Your Majesty. I&#x2019;m not the one you have been waiting for. I&#x2019;m truly sorry.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">It was the familiar guard.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">He sat down on a chair in the visitation room.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;You look very uncomfortable at my appearance.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Tae-hyuk didn&#x2019;t deny it.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Your family. Was it Seo Tae-min ssi and Seo Ha-ran? You won&#x2019;t be able to see the both of them.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Is that so?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Had they decided to give up everything?</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">He didn&#x2019;t mind&#xA0;</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">that</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#xA0;he wouldn&#x2019;t be able to see his family in his last minutes.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x2018;Thank you for treating me as family, even though I was unable to get rid of the false accusations.&#x2019; He only wanted to say those words.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Yes.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">This was what happened..</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">It would be best if they&#xA0;</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">saw</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#xA0;Seo Tae-hyuk as someone who never existed in the first place.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Then he would pray that his remaining family would live on happily. He decided to be satisfied with this thought.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Then the guard smirked.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;Seo Ha-ran ssi, Your Majesty&#x2019;s older sister, Seo Ha</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">-ran,</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#xA0;committed suicide last month.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;Huh?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;Is this surprising? No, not really.

Oh dear, oh dear. In the end, she was fired. Furthermore, I was told that she had quite a large debt. She eventually lost her remaining assets in a multi-level marketing scheme. Thus, in the end...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt"><em>Kek kek!</em></span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">The guard pretended to strangle himself.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;T-that is ridiculous!&quot; Why would Noonim do that?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Anyways,</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#xA0;what happened to your younger brother?

Not long after, he disappeared. I guess he thought he was a detective. He should have known not to overrate himself.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;......&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;My guess it that he is encased in concrete in a barrel drum at the bottom of the Yellow Sea. He should be getting friendly with his new neighbours. Well, what is the exact location of the Dragon King?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt"><em>Kwang!</em></span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Tae-hyuk struck the table with his fist.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">The prepared kimchi stew was&#xA0;</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">strewn about,</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#xA0;and the room became a mess.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Don&apos;t lie to me, you bastard! Are you completely crazy? What? My sister committed suicide after losing everything in a&#xA0;</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">pyramid</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#xA0;scheme? Don&#x2019;t take me for a fool! And Tae-min went missing after trying to save me? Don&apos;t play around! I will kill you!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">The guard held his side as he laughed.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;Hahaha! Your Majesty Seo Tae-hyuk. What, you will kill me? You, who has never even killed a single ant in your life?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">It was the right answer.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">At th</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">at</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#xA0;moment, Tae-hyuk thought it was strange.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Until now, he thought that&#xA0;</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">this</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#xA0;was the guard&#xA0;</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">that</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#xA0;he had known for 10 years</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">; however,</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#xA0;that was</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#xA0;not</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#xA0;the case.

You. You aren&#x2019;t a guard.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;Yes. Then what am I?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">The guard laughed.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Tae-hyuk, who saw the man&#x2019;s face, screamed.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Aaaaack!&quot;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">In the sockets</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#xA0;where&#xA0;</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">one&#x2019;s</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#xA0;eyeballs&#xA0;</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">were supposed to be</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#xA0;was rep</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">laced by&#xA0;</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">a hollow space.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">The mouth was ripped from ear to ear and something red dri</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">bbled down his chin</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#xA0;whenever he laughed.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">The thing smiled and said.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;I have a very mouth-watering proposal.

So I was locked up for 10 years for a murder I didn&#x2019;t commit? In the end, I was sentenced to death.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Tae-hyuk certainly didn&#x2019;t kill anyone. However, the evidence was perfect. There was the CCTV taken at the crime scene. The weapon with Tae-hyuk&#x2019;s fingerprints on them. An eyewitness also saw him escaping the crime scene.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;This, damn!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">His body started shaking.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;Wait a minute. It is just a dream. Just think of it as a shit dream...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">But something was wrong. It was too real to be a dream. It felt like he really had been confined in prison as a death row inmate until yesterday.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">If it was a dream then who was he now?</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Tae-hyuk looked around.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">It was a three pyeong room with a bunk bed and two desks. There was also a small bookcase with a simple structure.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">The unique dampness and mouldy smell was still the same.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">It was the room he shared with his brother Tae-min before he graduated from high school.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x2018;What? It feels like I&#x2019;m reminiscing about a memory that is more than 10 years old. Crazy. This is all due to that realistic dream.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">15 years had passed by in his dream</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">But in reality, only a single night had passed. Then what was this sense of incongruity?</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Anyway, I am still a&#xA0;</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">high school</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#xA0;student, right? Not a death row inmate?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Tae-hyuk calmed his chaotic mind and wanted to check.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Yes, a mirror!&quot;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Tae-hyuk mindlessly searched the room for a mirror. He would resolve things after confirming his appearance.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">If he didn&#x2019;t look like a high school student but a man in his 30s... Just thinking about i</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">t</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#xA0;caused him to have&#xA0;</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">goosebumps</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Eventually, he was able to find a small handheld&#xA0;</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">mirror</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;Ugh. A bad taste.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">The demon carved on the mirror gave off a bad feeling.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Did we ever have a mirror like this?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">It might belong to his younger brother.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">The place where he found it was in the bookshelf used by both of them.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;... Phew. Fortunately, I&#x2019;m still a high school student.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">The man in the mirror seemed to be in his late teens.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;Wait a minute. What is this?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Tae-hyuk looked around with a strange expression. However, there was nothing.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">He looked at the mirror again.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">There were a lot of strange letters on it.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">[Seo Tae-hyuk]</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">-Title: God of Crime</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">-Rating: Commoner (Lacking conditions for upgrade)</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">-Skills Possessed: None</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">In addition to this, a status window filled the mirro</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">r</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Tae-hyuk laughed to himself.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;This is a well made toy.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">The contents were commonly seen in popular online games.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">A person who liked things like this.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Inside the house, there was only Tae-min.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Either way, he was indeed a high school student.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Tae-hyuk sighed with relief.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">He wasn&#x2019;t a falsely accused death row prisoner. He was Seo Tae-hyuk, a high school student in the 2nd grade who li</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">v</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">ed with&#xA0;</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">his</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#xA0;older sister and younger brother. Then he started to remember some things.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Unlike his brother, who was a good student, he had a slightly delinquent appearance.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">He sometimes missed school and he couldn&#x2019;t exactly say that his grades were good.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Thus, he was treated as a troublemaker.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Still, at least he wasn&#x2019;t a high school gangster.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Um. Has Tae-min already left?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">He could smell&#xA0;</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">the scent of rice cooking from somewhere.&#xA0;</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">I</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">t seemed&#xA0;</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">that&#xA0;</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">his sister, Seo Ha-ran, was preparing breakfast.

Come eat!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">His sister&#x2019;s voice was heard.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Tae-hyuk scratched his head and headed towards the kitchen.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">* &#xA0; &#xA0; * &#xA0; &#xA0; *</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;......&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Tae-hyuk&#x2019;s eyes turned red.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Ha-ran asked with surprise.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;What is it? Did you have a scary dream or something?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Tae-min, who was sitting opposite to Tae-hyun, stared at him before shifting his gaze back to the English words in the book befor</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">e him</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">There wasn&#x2019;t much time remaining for his exam, so even the preparation time while eating was precious.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Dust entered my eyes.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">The menu for breakfast was kimchi stew. There was only a little bit of tofu</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">, and</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#xA0;didn&#x2019;t contain a single piece of meat.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Ha-ran hesitated before saying.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;... I&#x2019;m sorry, Noona will cook you one with meat when I get paid.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;It really is because dust entered my eyes. A</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">lso,</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#xA0;Noona&#x2019;s kimchi stew really is the best in the world</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">,</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">s</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">o delicious that I would want to eat it before I die.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">It was a sincere statement.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">He put a spoonful into his mouth and could taste his sister&#x2019;s kimchi stew.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">It was a dish that he couldn&#x2019;t eat in his dream, after all.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Oh my, this child. You&#x2019;ll be late. Eat quickly.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Ha-ran laughed as she moved her spoon. She didn&#x2019;t dislike Tae-hyuk&#x2019;s praise.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Their parents had both died in an accident</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">, so</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#xA0;Ha-ran became the sole guardian of Tae-hyuk and Tae-min. Despite being a flower in her early 20s, she was working double shifts at the factory.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">She didn&#x2019;t wear any makeup but to Tae-hyun, she was more beautiful than anyone else in the world.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Tae-hyuk bit his lip.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x2018;I&#x2019;ll have to get a job straight after graduating high school so I can help Noona.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Then he was startled.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">A memory from his dream of being a death row prisoner popped up.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x2018;I graduated from school. I obtained a job with a private security company because I had nothing useful,&#xA0;</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">save</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#xA0;my body. And I worked there for two years. Then...&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">He was framed and went to jail.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x2018;No! It&apos;s a dream, a dream! Damn...!&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Tae-hyuk turned on the TV to shake off the memories of the death row prisoner.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">-The prosecution is looking for the whereabouts of Yoo Cheol-ho, a prisoner who escaped from Central Prison on the 9th...</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Ha-ran shook her head and made a fuss as the news of a horrible criminal was heard.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;Omo. He still isn&#x2019;t caught. It was said that he might be near he</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">re</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">. Tae-hyuk, if you go outside, then only go when it is still light. If someone goes up to you then don&#x2019;t follow them. Do you understand?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;Noona. I&#x2019;m grown up. And why don&#x2019;t you say something to Tae-min?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Tae-min is steady.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Then I&#x2019;m bad?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Ohuhut!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Tae-hyuk and Tae-min were already high school students, but Ha-ran still viewed them as children.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Tae-hyuk smiled at his sister&#x2019;s worry and nodded.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;By the way. That person still hasn&#x2019;t been caught? He was clearly caught...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Yoo Cheol-ho. A familiar name.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">He had stayed in the room next to Tae-hyuk&#x2019;s for a while.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">In order words, a neighbour.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x2018;Of course, that was just in my dream.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Tae-hyuk knew why he had such a dream. It was because he kept hearing these things in the news every day.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Hyung. Did you eat something bad? Yoo Cheol-ho was caught after committing seven murders three months ago, and broke out of prison just last week. So he hasn&#x2019;t been caught.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Tae-min, who was eating rice quietly, interrupted.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Tae-hyuk frowned. Tae-min was interested in such things. This time, he was wrong.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">For sure...</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;What are you talking about? Yoo Cheol-ho escaped for six months and was caught after committing three more murders.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Tae-min sighed and said.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Phew, Hyung. Don&#x2019;t just read manhwa. You should watch the news as well. Yoo Cheol-ho was caught? They are completely clueless. There is also a pretty good reward.. You must have dreamt about catching him.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Wait a minute.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Didn&#x2019;t Yoo Cheol-ho clearly get caught after his escape?</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">He was a complete psycho and quite talkative.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Furthermore, he didn&#x2019;t sleep so he talked about his story until dawn.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">After two successful breakouts, he gained the nickname &#x2018;King of Jailbreaks.&#x2019; The place he went and how he escaped were all vivid in Tae-hyuk&#x2019;s head.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;So Yoo Cheol-ho&#x2019;s nickname isn&#x2019;t King of Jailbreaks?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Tae-min moved his index finger to the side of his head and moved it round and round.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Hey. That isn&#x2019;t something you should do to your hyung!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;Ah. It&apos;s already 8 o&apos;clock. You should hurry if you don&#x2019;t want to be late. The student manager said he would break your legs with a paddle if you are late again.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Tae-min got up and ran to his room.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x2018;Indeed, a terrible dream.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Not even the Pirate King but the King of Jailbreaks.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;If the dream is correct then Yoo Cheol-ho&#x2019;s accomplice should be caught in S City by now. But he isn&#x2019;t.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Tae-hyuk unwittingly said the thought that came to his head.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;You must be half-asleep.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Ha-ran laughed.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">A few minutes passed.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;T-Tae-hyuk.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Ha-ran, who was eating while watching the news, starting shivering like she had seen a ghost.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;Huh?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;... You were just talking about Yoo Cheol-ho&#x2019;s accomplice right?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;Yes. Why?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;L-look at that.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Ha-ran pointed to the TV with a trembling hand.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">-Breaking news. The accomplice to Yoo Cheol-ho&#x2019;s escape was caught in S City.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Tae-hyuk&#x2019;s mouth gaped open. He was so surprised that he didn&#x2019;t notice the falling spoon.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x2018;Wait. What is this? What is this?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">The content of the news was the same as his dream. The evidence was the same as Yoo Cheol-ho&#x2019;s first escape.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&apos;A dream. It&apos;s a dream! Then why is it happening in real life?&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;... Noona. Is that a rerun? This actually happened yesterday, or the day before, right?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;That... a live broadcast...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">The words stabbed at Tae-hyuk&#x2019;s chest like a dagger.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">It was a dream, so what was this?</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">A foresight dream? Returning to the past? Or was it just a coincidence?</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Ha-ran gazed at Tae-hyuk with worried eyes.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Tae-hyuk tried to look bright.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;Haha! I just said it. It came true by chance. Maybe I should go and buy a lottery ticket?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Hey ~ you really scared me.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;I have to go to school. Doesn&#x2019;t Noona come home late at night? You should be careful at night.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Prince-nim doesn&#x2019;t have to worry, I&#x2019;ll be careful. Have fun at school.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Yes, Noona.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#xA0;Tae-hyuk left the house with his bag.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">His laughter instantly disappeared from his face.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">According to his dream, Yoo Cheol-ho shouldn&#x2019;t be far from here.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x2018;I need to confirm if Yoo Cheol-ho is really there. Only then will I know if that was just a dream.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">He felt sorry for his sister but he wouldn&#x2019;t be able to go to school.</span></p><hr><p></p></div><p></p>
