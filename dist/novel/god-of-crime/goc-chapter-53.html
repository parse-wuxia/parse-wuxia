<p><span style="">Chapter 53 - Death Circus #4 &#xA0;</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk looked calm, but he was inwardly sighing with relief.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He made SY Capital suffer through the casino, which was their main source of revenue.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He intended to break Tiwai in the same manner.</span></p><p><span style="">However, infamous criminals, Choi Sung-yeol and Kim Joon-young, were behind Tiwai.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The scale itself was different.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He couldn&#x2019;t solve this case alone.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He needed to work inside and outside the Death Circus at the same time.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He needed reliable allies.&#xA0;</span><span style="">They needed to have courage and the ability to deceive others.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk confirmed that the identical screen on the Demon Revealing Mirror was still open.&#xA0;</span><span style="">His ally had sent him a message.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Well... I think that Moonlight Flower is better...&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">At first, he thought about getting Big Mama to help.&#xA0;</span><span style="">She would perfectly fulfill the role, but Tae-hyuk still couldn&#x2019;t trust her.&#xA0;</span><span style="">She was a woman who could betray him at any time, so he chose Moonlight Flower instead.</span></p><p><span style="">There was a little bit of insecurity, but once Tae-hyuk compiled all the information he knew, at least she wouldn&#x2019;t betray him.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The biggest problem was that it was impossible to communicate with people from inside the Death Circus.</span></p><p><span style="">It was for the sake of confidentiality.&#xA0;</span><span style="">If a phone could be used inside, then anyone would ask for help.&#xA0;</span><span style="">In order to maintain the Death Circus, it was absolutely necessary to stop that from happening.&#xA0;</span><span style="">In the end, a space was built that didn&#x2019;t even allow radio waves through.</span></p><p><span style="">However, Tae-hyuk had the crime skills.&#xA0;</span><span style="">With the Spying skill, he could see the state of an object from a remote place.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He used passwords to enable simple communication.</span></p><p><span style="">&apos;The A8, K9, and T4 panels are broken, meaning that there are two wolves remaining.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk started a simple stretch to relax.</span></p><p><span style="">Moonlight Flower bought a ticket to the Death Circus through Big Mama.&#xA0;</span><span style="">She appeared as a guest and told Tae-hyuk the entire situation.&#xA0;</span><span style="">If he had something to say to Moonlight Flower, then he would do a pre-determined action on camera.</span></p><p><span style="">All of Tae-hyuk&#x2019;s actions were recorded on camera.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He took advantage of this.&#xA0;</span><span style="">This was only possible for Tae-hyuk who had the crime skills.</span></p><p><span style="">If Tae-hyuk raised a finger, then Moonlight Flower would tell him the cards of the both of them.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It would be a strange situation if he lost.</span></p><p><span style="">For this, he invested his remaining affinity points and bought a trait for the Spying skill.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The palm-sized screen that was projected into the air was the new ability of the Spying skill.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;It is easy since I can see the contents without looking at the Demon Revealing Mirror.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">It was unfortunate that he spent all of his 13 points in a day, but the utilization was endless.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The Demon Revealing Mirror looked like a strange mirror on the surface.&#xA0;</span><span style="">In order to use his crime skills, he had to manipulate it directly.&#xA0;</span><span style="">This was no problem if it was a usual situation, but in a situation where even one small act could arouse suspicion, it served as a big penalty.</span></p><p><span style="">In the match against Kim Shin-hyeong, if he had any doubts about the Demon Revealing Mirror, then </span><span style="">Tae-hyuk wouldn&#x2019;t have been able to win.</span></p><p><span style="">The game that Tae-hyuk was playing now was Bluff Poker.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Placing the mirror on the table was like declaring that he could see the card on his forehead.</span></p><p><span style="">That&#x2019;s why he had invested three affinity points into the screen.&#xA0;</span><span style="">If he concentrated his mind, then he could project a simplified image into the air.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Now he didn&#x2019;t need to look into the mirror.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;I won&#x2019;t be treated as a pervert holding a mirror.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk laughed and started provoking his opponent in Bluff Poker.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Tae-soo. Do you want to raise your bet even though you are holding a 9? Um. I think my card is a 4. Is that right?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">His opponent trembled, as Tae-hyuk knew his exact card.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Park Tae-soo clenched his teeth.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was the first time that his poker face broke.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;This bastard...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Without realizing it, Bluff Poker had reached the mid-game.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The card that Tae-hyuk placed on his forehead was exactly a 4.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-soo didn&#x2019;t know how his could find out his card.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Was it because he counted the remaining cards?&#xA0;</span><span style="">That seemed like the most likely option.&#xA0;</span><span style="">However, that didn&#x2019;t explain the consecutive 10s.&#xA0;</span><span style="">What trick...?</span></p><p><span style="">Moreover, were his words before just a bluff?&#xA0;</span><span style="">Or did he really have the number 9?&#xA0;</span><span style="">The two 10 cards were already gone.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Having a 9 meant unconditionally winning, but it would be impossible to turn the situation around if it was a lie.&#xA0;</span><span style="">In the end, Tae-soo gave up this game.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Aigoo. Thank you for the 10 million won.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-soo wanted to pull away Cheol-su&#x2019;s laughing expression.&#xA0;</span><span style="">However, this was one of the few places where violence was banned in the Death Circus.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Tae-soo wanted to quickly check his hand for a second.</span></p><p><span style="">A 2 or a 3...&#xA0;</span><span style="">It would be easy for Cheol-su&#x2019;s 4 to beat it.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The opponent was bluffing.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He sensed it using his insight.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Kuaaaaak!&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-soo screamed as he saw the number 9 card.</span></p><p><span style="">Then Tae-hyuk said again.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I wasn&#x2019;t lying earlier. If you feel doubt, then you will self-destruct. Why don&#x2019;t you believe your opponent for once?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Bluff Poker was a game to deceive the opponent.&#xA0;</span><span style="">With bold bets, they could make the other person die even with a strong hand.&#xA0;</span><span style="">However, Tae-hyuk didn&#x2019;t bluff once and still achieved a complete victory over Tae-soo.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-soo had accumulated pride in his skills as a card shark over his long life.&#xA0;</span><span style="">In the end, Tae-soo completely collapsed.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He still had 20 million left, but he gave up the match.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk looked at the older brother, Dae-soo.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;In cases like this, the older brother normally gets revenge for messing with his younger brother. What will you do?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Kuock!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Dae-soo&#x2019;s face distorted.</span></p><p><span style="">Both people had started the game with 180 million.&#xA0;</span><span style="">But at 10 times the stake, 150 million was lost in just 20 minutes.&#xA0;</span><span style="">There was only 20,000 left.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The next fee payment time was approaching, and the 20,000 was their last resort.&#xA0;</span><span style="">In addition, if they ran out of money then they would have to bet with their blood.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was suicide if he didn&#x2019;t know the method the opponent used to read the cards.</span></p><p><span style="">Dae-soo suppressed his anger and said.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Don&#x2019;t think that this is over. This stage is just starting. I would find out what trick you&#x2019;re using and beat you with my own hands.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Well, you spoke long words but are you surrendering? I have suffered a lot. Anyway, I am quite busy.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk pointed to his badge that had increased to 340 and left the Bluff Poker stadium.</span></p><p><span style="">What? Suffered a lot?&#xA0;</span><span style="">The gambling brothers howled out Lee Cheol-su&#x2019;s name.</span></p><p><span style="">@</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;W-What did you do?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">An Eun-jeong asked in a careful tone.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The Death Circus was a place where people risked their lives to gain 10 million won.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Yet Cheol-su had gained 160 million in just 20 minutes.&#xA0;</span><span style="">She couldn&#x2019;t believe it despite seeing it with her own eyes.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It felt like a dream.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ah, perhaps...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">An Eun-jeong pinched herself just in case.&#xA0;</span><span style="">In fact, it didn&#x2019;t make sense.&#xA0;</span><span style="">A death game couldn&#x2019;t be happening in South Korea.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ahat!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">But unfortunately, it was a reality.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk pointed to Eun-jeong&#x2019;s badge and raised a finger to his lips before speaking in a small voice.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I have to keep it a secret.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ah... The badges are fitted with microphones. Yes, I understand.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Eun-jeong sighed with regret.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The masked people listening to their conversation through the monitor responded in the same manner.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk nodded with a thankful face.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Then now what? We already have 360 million... Just a little bit more and the both of us can escape together...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Eun-jeong spoke in a stammering tone.&#xA0;</span><span style="">She wanted to get out of here quickly. But Cheol-su shot that down.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;We can&#x2019;t get out of this place just yet. From now on...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk paused and pulled out a notebook from his pocket.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He kept his back to the camera so they couldn&#x2019;t see what he wrote.</span></p><p><span style="">An Eun-jeong&#x2019;s face turned pale as she saw what he wrote.</span></p><p><span style="">It was&#xA0;different for the guests wearing the masks.</span></p><p><span style="">@</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;What, what? What just happened?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;He doesn&#x2019;t intend to leave just yet?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What the hell is his reason?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Oh, why isn&#x2019;t he saying? Bring that Kim Joon-young bastard here right now!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Eh? The woman&#x2019;s face is turning white! I think she read something great!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Oh, I want to know as well!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Please let me hear it!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The guests were frustrated.&#xA0;</span><span style="">They had been like gods watching everything that happened in the Death Circus, yet these gods were being fooled by the man called Lee Cheol-su.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Unlike the other excited people, the lion mask withdrew for his own analysis.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Maybe he knows the system perfectly. In addition, he has tremendous skills. Who the hell is he? Hrmm. </span><span style="">He is called Lee Cheol-su?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The lion mask decided to use his power to find out the identity of Lee Cheol-su.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He pulled out a phone from his pocket.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Right now, dozens of people were being mobilized in order to find out information on Cheol-su.</span></p><p><span style="">He would just relax and wait.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Political power was useful for incidents like this.</span></p><p><span style="">The lion mask smiled with satisfaction and leaned back in his chair.</span></p><p><span style="">@</span></p><p><span style="">An Eun-jeong raised her hands to her mouth as she read the content listed in the notebook.</span></p><p><span style="">It was so surprising that Cheol-su had conveyed it in writing.&#xA0;</span><span style="">There were exactly two sentences written.</span></p><p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">The other people.</span></i></p><p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">Save all of them.</span></i></p><p><span style="">Many people still remained in the Death Circus, yet Cheol-su was saying that he would save all of them.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Just two people alone needed needed 400 million to go free.&#xA0;</span><span style="">In the first place, all of the money that entered the Death Circus was one billion.</span></p><p><span style="">The reduction of 10 million won an hour was no joke.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was a situation where Cheol-su had already obtain half of the money present.&#xA0;</span><span style="">All of the money in the Death Circus was being used to extend their own lives, and they could barely think about escaping.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Although everyone in the Death Circus basically started with 50 million won, the eight hour fee alone was 80 million won.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was a situation where money was being consumed just by resting.</span></p><p><span style="">This place was designed like that from the beginning.&#xA0;</span><span style="">In the end, only one or two people would be able to get out alive.&#xA0;</span><span style="">For the most part, they were the wolves that Kim Joon-young hired.</span></p><p><span style="">Cheol-su had come here to help her, yet he wanted to save the remaining people?&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was an impossible task.</span></p><p><span style="">An Eun-jeong felt dizzy at the thought.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Tae-hyuk looked at Eun-jeong with a relaxed face and declared.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I&#x2019;m sorry, but Noona can&#x2019;t return home yet. The night has just begun.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">200 million won was enough to get Eun-jeong out of here.</span><span style="">If it was just that much money, then he would have chosen an attraction that he was familiar with, one that he knew how to beat.</span></p><p><span style="">However, he couldn&#x2019;t finish it with just escaping.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He had to smash the Death Circus and Tiwai International in order to save Seo Ha-ran and An Eun-jeong.&#xA0;</span><span style="">As a bonus, he would catch the two criminals, Kim Joon-young and Choi Sung-yeol, who were on the blacklist.</span></p><p><span style="">There were still two wolves hiding in this place.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Maybe one of them was the criminal that made the perfume that confused the senses.&#xA0;</span><span style="">There was still a huge amount of work to do here.</span></p><p><span style="">He felt sorry towards An Eun-jeong but he needed a little more time.</span></p><p><span style="">Until the closing of the Death Circus - 260 minutes.</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p>
