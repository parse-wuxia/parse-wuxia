<p><span style="">Chapter 162 - God of Crime #4</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p><p><i><span style="">Pajijijik!</span></i></p><p><span style="">Electricity flashed every time he moved his body.&#xA0;</span><span style="">If he wasn&#x2019;t wearing rubber clothing then it would be transferred away from him.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I-Intruder, i-intruder!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The pierrots holding clubs or knives rushed over.</span></p><p><span style="">&apos;After a long time, Sixth Sense!&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">Then he felt like he had eyes in the back of his head.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Tae-hyuk turned and fired the taser gun.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It wasn&#x2019;t a weapon with bullets, so he didn&#x2019;t trigger Shooting Spree.&#xA0;</span><span style="">However, the pierrots were even worse than the Nuclear Bomb members at fighting.&#xA0;</span><span style="">They were also crazy, making it was easy to deal with them.</span></p><p><span style="">He didn&#x2019;t need to enter the radius of the opponent&#x2019;s attack.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He had achieved stability and the opponents couldn&#x2019;t hit Tae-hyuk&#x2019;s body.</span></p><p><span style="">&apos;It is like a minor version of the bullet lines.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hieeeeek!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk twisted his body and attacked the pierrots.</span></p><p><i><span style="">Kkikikikik!</span></i></p><p><span style="">As if it received a signal, the machine arm protruded from the bag on his back and struck the abdomen of a pierrot.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Kuheok!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The person was a half-zombie due to the Psychotropic Incense, but it was an ordinary human scream.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I can&#x2019;t control the strength because it is on my back. Well, this much seems fine? I have to move without killing as much as possible...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Then a pierrot aimed a club at his back.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Tae-hyuk avoided the opponent and aimed the taser gun at him.</span></p><p><i><span style="">Pajijik, pajijik!</span></i></p><p><span style="">&quot;Hukakakakak!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The pierrot collapsed as the high-voltage current coursed through his body.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Five pierrots went down and only one remained standing.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Only one pierrot left! Are you going to shout?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The opponent&#x2019;s eyes were still blazing.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Usually in this situation, a person would step back to maintain their posture.&#xA0;</span><span style="">However, the pierrot was determined to fight despite being the last person.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was to fulfill his order to defend this place.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk clicked his tongue.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Even though you only have weapons from the iron age...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The scarier thing was that their power could be increased infinitely through the Psychotropic Incense.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was a strange thing that this didn&#x2019;t happen in his previous life.</span></p><p><span style="">The reason was that Phantom helped in the Bomber&#x2019;s revenge.</span></p><p><span style="">It was clear.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Tae-hyuk had been framed for killing Mister Park and was sent to prison.&#xA0;</span><span style="">And the Psychotropic Incense made by the Yakuza was ridiculously dangerous. &#xA0;</span><span style="">It was something that he couldn&#x2019;t allow to be released in South Korea.</span></p><p><span style="">But as a result, a more dangerous monster was born, and Seo Ha-ran was its offering.&#xA0;</span><span style="">So...</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;...I have to stop it. Since I have the memories of my previous life, I am the only one who can prevent it.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk bit his lip and looked at the remaining pierrot in the hallway.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The pierrot&#x2019;s bloodshot eyes flashed.&#xA0;</span><span style="">This was a typical symptom of Psychotropic Incense addiction.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Either way, this one remaining pierrot wouldn&#x2019;t be able to stop him from entering the underground laboratory.</span></p><p><span style="">He gripped the iron pipe securely.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;&#x2014;The drg has turned you into a mad dog.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">His use of the Machina and taser guns was minimal.&#xA0;</span><span style="">There was still the Clown left.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He needed to leave some power to deal with the Clown.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The pierrot asked hesitantly and with poor articulation.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;You, identity, what?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Hyu~ there was someone who could speak? Does the effect of the Psychotropic Incense differ depending on your constitution?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;...You, can&#x2019;t, go.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The pierrot held an iron pipe in both hands and moved in front of Tae-hyuk.&#xA0;</span><span style="">But Tae-hyuk couldn&#x2019;t feel the will to protect something.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The pierrot was just like an animated puppet that received a command.</span></p><p><span style="">It felt like Tae-hyuk was looking at himself from his previous life.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He was a temporary worker at a security company and was dispatched to a large corporation.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He chose it because it made money, not because it excited him.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The pay was just enough for living expenses.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He had to believe that he could live a better life if he worked hard.&#xA0;</span><span style="">And the result...</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Sheesh. I remembered something bad.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk said before smiling. </span><span style="">He had smashed that future with his own hands.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Now he only needed to take down the Clown and save his sister, and it would all be over.&#xA0;</span><span style="">His previous life couldn&#x2019;t be reached anymore...</span></p><p><span style="">Ha-ran&#x2019;s dream would come true.</span></p><p><span style="">He adjusted his iron pipe.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The pierrot picked up an iron pipe rolling across the ground. It was added to his original one and now he was holding two pipes.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I, two. You, one. I, won...all.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Ah? Is that so?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk bent down and swung the iron pipe at the opponent&#x2019;s leg.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;K-Kuwak!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The pierrot lost his balance and fell down.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;One more shot!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">He used the gap to hit the head, making the pierrot faint.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Tae-hyuk dusted off his hands and muttered,</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;...This is the end of the tiresome pierrots.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Then he suddenly crouched down on the ground.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He said to the unconscious pierrot,</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;You asked who I was? I am Seo Ha-ran&#x2019;s brother, Seo Tae-hyuk. Well. This is the end.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk got up.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He looked at the firmly closed door in front of him.</span></p><p><span style="">The Clown was in there.</span></p><p><span style="">@</span></p><p><span style="">The underground laboratory had a somber atmosphere.</span></p><p><span style="">There was a huge flask with an unknown purpose that was installed in the middle of the room.&#xA0;</span><span style="">A bright red plasma was shining inside it.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk recalled something similar to it.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was definitely a new technology at the Children&#x2019;s Science Museum.&#xA0;</span><span style="">His parents had taken him to see it with Ha-ran and Tae-min.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was one of the few memories from his younger days.</span></p><p><span style="">There was someone looking at the flask.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He was dressed in a white coat and had funny clown makeup on his face.&#xA0;</span><span style="">His height was a little bit taller than Detective Cho Kang-suk&#x2019;s, but his body seemed like it was only made of bones.&#xA0;</span><span style="">There was charred white hair on top of his hair.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The skin around his mouth was severely distorted due to burns.</span></p><p><span style="">It was a terrible look.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Obviously, the other places on his body wouldn&#x2019;t be much different.</span></p><p><span style="">The Clown started stroking the flask like it was his beloved child.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Kiik! Kiiiiiik! Kilkil.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Something shone in the gap between his bright red lips.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Tae-hyuk ignored the Clown and looked around the laboratory.</span></p><p><span style="">&apos;There is a pierrot.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">He was waiting in a corner of the laboratory, as if he was sleeping.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Pierrots were standing over a chair and Seo Ha-ran was lying on top of it.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Apart from being unconscious, her body seemed fine.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;N-Noona!&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">He wanted to rush over and grab her hand to get out of here, but he couldn&#x2019;t do that.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The pierrots nearby were holding weapons.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Ha-ran could be in danger if he did anything wrong.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk took the time to look inside the laboratory.</span></p><p><span style="">He felt something.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The Clown turned his head and looked at the entrance.&#xA0;</span><span style="">There was clearly nothing there, but he bowed down and greeted the air.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Uhaha... I was so immersed in my research that I didn&#x2019;t realize a guest had come. It is a shabby place but please come in.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;......!&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">He had been looking through the door with a hidden camera.&#xA0;</span><span style="">How did the Clown notice?&#xA0;</span><span style="">His words showed that it wasn&#x2019;t just a gamble.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk placed the opera mask on his face and entered.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He couldn&#x2019;t let it be known that his purpose was Ha-ran.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He had to treat her like she was just a decoration in the laboratory.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;I&#x2019;m sorry to throw you away, but I will use you one last time Phantom.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">It was impossible to become his old self after he escaped from the influence of the Demon Revealing Mirror.&#xA0;</span><span style="">However, he had spent over half a year as Phantom.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He could do this type of acting quite simply.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk entered the lab naturally, like it was his own home.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Director Go Ah-tae... no, should I call you the Clown now? It seems like you are doing something very interesting.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;...This is true. Are you wearing a strange mask?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;It is like my trademark. That incense also won&#x2019;t be able to get past this mask.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ohh! No! I know who you are! Unbelievable! Kiik, kikikikik!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The Clown suddenly started laughing.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Then he began to scratch at his face.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The nails dug at the burnt skin and it became bloody in an instant.</span></p><p><span style="">The Clown continued to laugh while harming himself.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Then he said with a grin.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;You! Seo Tae-hyuk! Right?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;&#x2026;!?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">At the moment, Tae-hyuk&#x2019;s heart froze.&#xA0;</span><span style="">How do this madman know his identity?&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was impossible even for the mafia.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;D-D-Don&#x2019;t tell me! Am I wrong? You clearly have the same smell as my assistant!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;...Smell?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk made a mistake.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Even if he used the mask, he normally triggered the Disguise or Transformation skill as well.&#xA0;</span><span style="">However, he was only using a minimum of his crime skills now, so he was just wearing the opera mask.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Despite all of this, he didn&#x2019;t think he would be discovered through smell.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk glared at the opponent.</span></p><p><span style="">At that moment, the Demon Revealing Mirror sent him a message to tempt him.</span></p><p><span style="">[Your identity has been discovered. Kill the opponent to prevent it from being leaked!]</span></p><p><span style="">In any other circumstances, he would ignore the message; however, he could do it easily this time.&#xA0;</span><span style="">As Tae-hyuk was conflicted, the Clown opened his mouth with an unconcerned expression.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Well, well, well! A precious guest has come! I don&#x2019;t have any tea to serve! What should I do, Jung Cho-gyu?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The Clown seem to ask someone but there was no reply.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He started to look around the room with a hand on his forehead. But he couldn&#x2019;t find the person he was looking for.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Where, where, where are you? Another cigarette... Kuhehe! Kuhehehehek!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The Clown&#x2019;s face distorted with a strange joy.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Kekekekek! I am talking to you! Jung Cho-gyu, Jung Cho-gyuuuuu! I killed you! Kihehehehehe!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk gulped as he looked at the Clown&#x2019;s actions.</span></p><p><span style="">Crazy.</span></p><p><span style="">That person was completely crazy.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;...Isn&apos;t that right? Jung Cho-gyu said my research was a failure! Such a person can&#x2019;t be kept alive!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">It seemed as though he was seeking agreement.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;My great research! There is no chance it will fail. I will succeeed!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The Clown stomped his feet.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was at that moment.&#xA0;</span><span style="">One of the pierrots seemed to slightly recover their minds and spoke,</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;D-Director, nim... The Core Drive is really dangerous. Do something wrong... really big accident...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Huhhh? Huhhhhhhhh? Did you just say that I failed?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The Clown&#x2019;s face distorted with anger thrust a sharp skewer at the pierrot.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Blood and flesh splashed as the person collapsed.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;K-Kuwak! Kuaaaak!&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">The Clown ignored the screams as he straddled the body and repeated the actions.&#xA0;</span><span style="">After less than 10 seconds, the person had died.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Huh? My research won&#x2019;t fail! My research is perfect! It is perfect!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">A creepy madness.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk bit his lip.</span></p><p><span style="">A monster was in front of him.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Just a week ago, he was a researcher who wanted to make progress in science, but an ugly monster was born due to an accident.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk slowly approached the Clown.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Clown. I know how your research will turn out.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;You will fail.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The Clown was furious.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He rushed towards Tae-hyuk with the iron skewer that he had just used to kill his subordinate.</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p>
