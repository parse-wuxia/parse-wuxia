<p>Chapter 27: Power Deployment #4</p><p></p><hr><p></p><p><span style="">B High School was a big school with changing rooms separate from the gymnasium.</span></p><p><span style="">However, once the number of students increased, people who broke the established rules appeared.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was a hassle for one to go to the locker rooms that were far away, and for those who just wanted to do special activities.</span></p><p><span style="">Therefore, there were some who changed clothes in the classrooms of the special activities building.</span></p><p><span style="">This was what the voyeur was aiming for.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The boundaries in the special activities building were loose compared to those in the locker room. There were many hiding spots to place the camera.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It wasn&#x2019;t even a changing room in the first place, so there weren&#x2019;t many people who would ever think that cameras would be installed in such places.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;That is the psychology of the voyeur.&apos;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk searched through the special activities classrooms and looked for hidden cameras.&#xA0;</span><span style="">In the end, he found more than 30.</span></p><p><span style="">They were high definition cameras, and were no longer recording because their memory was full.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Fortunately, Tae-hyuk wasn&#x2019;t recorded on the cameras.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Can I use this?&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">First of all, one thing had become clear.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;The person who installed the hidden cameras knows the inside of the school perfectly.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">They knew which classroom was used for which purpose.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The cameras were hidden in places with good angles.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The voyeur had calculated all of this, which was an impossible feat unless they were an insider.</span></p><p><span style="">&apos;If so, it is a problem.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">In this situation, Tae-hyuk was an outsider. If he did something wrong, then he could be mistaken as the voyeur.&#xA0;</span><span style="">In the end, collecting the evidence alone didn&#x2019;t mean Tae-hyuk would catch him. </span><span style="">He had to find the crime scene.</span></p><p><span style="">The difficulty level was much higher than usual.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;By the way... No matter how much I think about it, X-ray Vision is way too good to pass up.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">There was a chance that X-ray Vision could be obtained again later in the future.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He couldn&#x2019;t just give up Forgery that he had invested two weeks into.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;... Don&#x2019;t be so instinctual, Seo Tae-hyuk! I need Forgery right now!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">In order to regain Rosario that Big Mama had, he needed the fully mastered Forgery skill.</span></p><p><span style="">It was necessary to first find out exactly where the voyeur worked.</span></p><p><span style="">The cameras didn&#x2019;t have a long range transmission feature, so recorded content had to be directly collected.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Tae-hyuk placed the cameras back in their original positions and installed a timer that could only be checked by him.</span></p><p><span style="">There were state of the art technologies that could notify him when it was touched. </span><span style="">Of course, Tae-hyuk had no such abilities, which was why he took full advantage of his skills.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk placed common items like a glass cup or a book near the places where the cameras were hidden.&#xA0;</span><span style="">If someone touched the items, then they would fall.</span></p><p><span style="">Of course, if there were only one or two items, then they might not be touched. However, there were more than 30 cameras, so the voyeur had to make a mistake at least once.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk was aiming for that.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;I didn&#x2019;t know that Spying had such a feature.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">Spying could see the titles and abilities of the target, which didn&#x2019;t just apply to people, but also to objects.&#xA0;</span><span style="">If he registered a glass cup in advance, then he could check its status.</span></p><p><span style="">&apos;Well, I won&#x2019;t be able to tell if it is just touched. Destruction is different.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">He would get alerts through the Demon Revealing Mirror.</span></p><p><span style="">For example, [Glass Cup] would transform into [Broken Glass Cup].</span></p><p><span style="">By taking advantage of this, he could use things commonly seen as a security device.</span></p><p><span style="">It was a hidden use of the Spying skill.</span></p><p><span style="">&apos;Now, the installation is done!&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk set up traps in locations that he had unknowingly touched while collecting the hidden cameras.&#xA0;</span><span style="">This would tell him when the voyeur was active.</span></p><p><span style="">Now he just had to wait quietly.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Then, should I go to Eun-young?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">A few days ago, he scored 80 points on a mock exam that she had given him.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Compared to the first time, his score had risen by more than 20 points.</span></p><p><span style="">There were 10 days left before the retest.</span></p><p><span style="">His preparations were slowly progressing.</span></p><p></p><p style="text-align: center"><span style="">* &#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;* &#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;*</span></p><p></p><p><span style="">Today, he was in a good condition and his intelligence increased by three, making a total of 28.</span></p><p><span style="">It was almost seven times higher than when he first received the &#x2018;Spying&#x2019; skill.</span></p><p><span style="">&apos;Well, I don&#x2019;t think my head has improved by seven times.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">However, he recently felt like things had been going well so far.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The new use of the Spying skill was also a by-product of his increased intelligence.</span></p><p><span style="">One worry was that the voyeur would be too cautious and wouldn&#x2019;t get caught in the trap.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Then I would have to go to plan B...&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">However, his worries were groundless.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Out of a total of 30 traps, six gave him notifications.</span></p><p><span style="">&apos;The glass cup broke. The receipt was torn. The tissue... Ugh, it is now dirty.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">All the common items told him about the actions of the voyeur.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Isn&#x2019;t this better than I thought?&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">Just installing it let him know his opponent&#x2019;s activity time.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He also knew the route the voyeur walked.</span></p><p><span style="">&apos;Based on his speed, he definitely spends longer inside the rooms.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk confirmed that all the voices required for the Voice Modulation skill were registered.</span></p><p><span style="">He needed the voices of girls A, B, C, and D to catch the opponent.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The security guard&#xA0;was also necessary.&#xA0;</span><span style="">And finally, Cho Kang-suk&#x2019;s voice.</span></p><p><span style="">The voyeur started his activities in the late evening.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk decided to practice painting until that time. The proficiency of Forgery increased rapidly as he thought about what he learned from Lee Hana.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Not only did he copy Lee Hana&#x2019;s landscape painting, he also copied various other things.</span></p><p><span style="">The important thing was to figure out the mindset of the person who painted it.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Even if he painted the image with the same technique, there would still be a difference in understanding.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk made a comparison between the two pieces.</span></p><p><span style="">He looked at what he painted before Lee Hana&#x2019;s lesson, and what he painted after it.&#xA0;</span><span style="">They were obviously works created with the same proficiency in the Forgery skill.</span></p><p><span style="">However, after understanding the thoughts and feelings of the original artists, he could feel a strange vitality exuding from the painting. </span><span style="">It seemed that it would come alive at any moment.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Uhuh! It is difficult, difficult!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The profound world of art!</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk yawned and stretched.</span></p><p><span style="">The proficiency of Forgery was still over 50 points, so his technique had noticeably improved.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He could now almost completely copy high school level paintings.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;... I have to get ready.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">He pulled out a bromide photograph from his pocket.</span></p><p><span style="">It was a compelling photo of the back of a girl changing clothes from a nude magazine popular with soldiers.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk triggered the Forgery skill and started to copy the nude photograph.</span></p><p><span style="">In a way, this was also an artwork.</span></p><p><span style="">However, it was the first time using Forgery on a photo to transfer to a painting.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He also had to draw it four times bigger for it to be mistaken as a real person.</span></p><p><span style="">&apos;Think of the mindset... As much as possible! He has to be excited to see this! Therefore, it has to be as sensual as possible!&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I-It is finished!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">After more than an hour of work, a painting depicting the back of a girl changing clothes was finished.</span></p><p><span style="">[A great work of art has been completed.]</span></p><p><span style="">[You have perfectly understood the artist&#x2019;s mind.]</span></p><p><span style="">[It seems as though it is alive.]</span></p><p><span style="">[Your Forgery skill proficiency has increased tremendously.]</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ahem... I&#x2019;m ashamed...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk coughed.</span></p><p><span style="">In fact, it was like catching a moth. The mindset of the person who took a photo like this was obvious.</span></p><p><span style="">Of course, it wasn&#x2019;t the same quality as the photo. </span><span style="">If someone looked closely, then they could tell it was a painting.&#xA0;</span><span style="">However, the atmosphere of the painting was more tangible than the original.</span></p><p><span style="">He felt dirty.&#xA0;</span><span style="">At that moment, Tae-hyuk&#x2019;s face was red. He was excited to see the painting.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk blocked his nose and muttered.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;W-Why does it feel like blood is dripping down?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">He could now understand the feelings of the original photographer.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hum hum. Then, I will have to install this on the voyeur&#x2019;s established path.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">He had a premonition that there would be more to the trap than he thought.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk&#x2019;s plan was simple.</span></p><p><span style="">Install the painting of a girl changing clothes in an empty classroom. The curtains were covered, creating a breathtaking situation where only the silhouette could be seen.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He would then use Voice Modulation to mimic a female voice and give a sense of presence.&#xA0;</span><span style="">This scene was just too amazing for the voyeur to pass up.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Naturally, he would concentrate on that place.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Then, Tae-hyuk would use the voice of the guards and Kang-suk to start hunting a rabbit.</span></p><p><span style="">In the hallway, he painted wall paintings with the Forgery skill.&#xA0;</span><span style="">People wouldn&#x2019;t be able to make a normal judgement if they were embarrassed.&#xA0;</span><span style="">If the police suddenly entered, then the voyeur would start to freak out. </span></p><p><span style="">However, Tae-hyuk changed the structure of the special activities building.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He painted hallways on the walls with the Forgery skill.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">Under normal circumstances, the voyeur would never be fooled. However, that would change if situation was urgent.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The voyeur would be moved along Tae-hyuk&#x2019;s desired route.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;The special activities building turns off the lights after school. In a confused state, it would be hard for the voyeur to tell if it was a painting or if it was reality.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk looked at the piece of paper on his desk.</span></p><p><span style="">On it were detailed instructions about the route that he would drive his opponent down.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Then, let&#x2019;s start with plan &#x2018;I&#x2019;m alone in school!&#x2019;&#x201D;</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p>
