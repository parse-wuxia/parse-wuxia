<p><span style="">Chapter 68 - DATE HARD 2.0 #1 &#xA0;</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p><p><span style="">Winter vacation was coming up next week so the inside of the classroom was loud.</span></p><p><span style="">On December 23, there would be a short break for two weeks.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Once the new year began, students would start earnestly entering hardcore exam mode for university admissions.</span></p><p><span style="">Seo Tae-hyuk sat at a window seat and stared blankly in the air, looking at the Demon Revealing Mirror.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The Bomber had given him 50 affinity points.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Doesn&#x2019;t it seem like an awfully long time since I last came to school?&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">Due to so many incidents occurring, he had been skipping school for almost 10 days straight.&#xA0;</span><span style="">If it was the same as before, then he would be forced to see the student adviser.&#xA0;</span><span style="">However, some time ago, Seo Tae-hyuk was ranked fourth in the school due to the final examinations.</span></p><p><span style="">There was no reason to talk to him, and the only one who didn&#x2019;t change their attitude was Jung Nam-ho, his homeroom teacher.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hey! Tae-hyuk! You weren&#x2019;t in school for a week. What have you been doing?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">He seemed really concerned.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Tae-hyuk scratched his head and replied,</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I couldn&#x2019;t concentrate on studying so I went to the temple to pray.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Such words are coming from your mouth. Is the sun rising in the west?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk pulled out a mock exam score card.&#xA0;</span><span style="">All of the subjects on there were rated first class.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Hmm... What is this? This is great!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Jung Nam-ho ruffled Tae-hyuk&#x2019;s hair with an impressed expression.&#xA0;</span><span style="">His score was a result of steadily receiving the help of An Eun-young&#x2019;s studying skill and possessing an intelligence of around 50 points.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Criminals should have a good mind.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">The increase in stats didn&#x2019;t simply indicate a change in numbers.&#xA0;</span><span style="">More ideas popped up when he needed it.</span></p><p><span style="">Seo Tae-hyuk was completely different from when he caught Yoo Cheol-ho.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It wasn&#x2019;t just his crime skills increasing.</span></p><p><span style="">Sometimes it was eerie thinking about it.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Well, have a good winter vacation. I will consult with you at the beginning of school.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk would be a third year in two weeks.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was the time to study in order to enter a good university.</span></p><p><span style="">However, there was a limit to acting as a student.&#xA0;</span><span style="">First of all, his top priority was to change the future and to catch criminals in order to make money.</span></p><p><span style="">&apos;The course...&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">In the future he remembered, he didn&#x2019;t go to university.&#xA0;</span><span style="">As soon as he graduated from high school, he became a part time worker for a staffing company and worked as a guard.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Going to university meant that he would have a completely different future.</span></p><p><span style="">&apos;I should go on a tour of the universities with Class President.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">What course department should he enter?&#xA0;</span><span style="">He decided to slowly decide.</span></p><p><span style="">After Jung Nam-ho&#x2019;s words, there were five minutes left before classes started.</span></p><p><span style="">In the meantime, An Eun-young carefully spoke from where she was sitting beside him.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Of course, it wasn&#x2019;t because she was afraid of Tae-hyuk; she was simply ashamed.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;These days, there are many bullies near our school.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Eh? Really?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk&#x2019;s eyes widened as he looked at An Eun-young.&#xA0;</span><span style="">This topic came out from Class President&#x2019;s mouth.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Shouldn&#x2019;t she be more concerned about textbooks rather than gossiping?</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;They were originally a bad group that operated outside of Seoul. There seemed to be a crackdown in that area so they moved their activities to this side. A few students of our school have already lost money.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Bad group?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Nuclear Bomb is their name and the scale is quite large.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">As the class leader, An Eun-young felt anxious about her classmates.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;They are quite famous if Class President knows about it.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Uh, yes... You should be careful.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk made a bitter expression,</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Why are you telling me to be careful?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What? You shouldn&#x2019;t go to dangerous places.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">He spoke out as a joke but An Eun-young looked serious.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Tae-hyuk inwardly sighed.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Okay. I understand, Class President. I won&#x2019;t go anywhere dangerous.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">A small smile appeared on An Eun-young&#x2019;s face and she muttered in a small voice so that Tae-hyuk couldn&#x2019;t hear,</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;If you do something dangerous, then you&#x2019;ll get hurt, and we won&#x2019;t be able to go to university together.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Huh? What did you say?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ah, nothing.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">An Eun-young noticed Tae-hyuk&#x2019;s body condition.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It seemed like it wasn&#x2019;t good lately.&#xA0;</span><span style="">She thought about inviting him to her house for a good meal.&#xA0;</span><span style="">She still hadn&#x2019;t been able to reward him for helping her unni. It had been a long time since the two of them...</span></p><p><span style="">At that moment, An Eun-young shyly shook her head.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Ah right. Tae-hyuk. Do you have any plans for the vacation?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">As the saying went, she leapt straight into the fire.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The day she was talking about was Christmas Eve.&#xA0;</span><span style="">If there was time then studying at home like they did before...</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Uh, I have a date that night.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;D-Date?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">An Eun-young&#x2019;s voice shook.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Who was Tae-hyuk dating?</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Ah, Class President doesn&#x2019;t know. On that day, my Noona has a date. I thought I&#x2019;d give her some support.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Uh, really? Ha-ran unni?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Their first date was a complete mess, so I thought about helping her this time. I call it Date Hard 2.0!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">An Eun-young was nervous about Tae-hyuk&#x2019;s naming sense, which seemed to be from 10 years in the past.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;So you will be busy that day. Ah, that&apos;s right. Then I will make you a schedule for studying next year. I&#x2019;ll make some good and delicious food for you.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Um. Yes.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk didn&#x2019;t know how much his future would change in one year.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Meanwhile, he didn&#x2019;t notice that An Eun-young was looking at him every five minutes.</span></p><p><span style="">@</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk headed to a construction site after school.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Due to the situation of the adults, it had been neglected for almost a year.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I think the performance is getting better.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">This was the place that Tae-hyuk went to in order to practice his crime skills.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was steadily rising, but since he hadn&#x2019;t learnt any new skills ever since the hippo incident, he needed to make sure that he could perfectly use the skills he already had.</span></p><p><span style="">After his Spying skill was strengthened, it was possible to project the Demon Revealing Mirror into the air, so he didn&#x2019;t need to take the mirror out of his pocket anymore.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The time required to activate the skill was also greatly reduced.</span></p><p><span style="">He also used Robbery to take all the money from the bag that the police officer was carrying.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was a perfect robbery that wasn&#x2019;t even detected by the sharp reflexes of the people trained to be sensitive to that type of thing.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It took a lot of practice to steal that fast, but the result was satisfactory.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;I was able to steal 150 million won without anyone seeing.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">Now it was possible to use the Robbery skill as naturally as flowing water.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The next thing to do was practice the Violence skill.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Once he used it, he held an incredibly hard iron pipe, and also temporarily increased his physical strength and agility.&#xA0;</span><span style="">However, the Violence skill quickly consumed his stamina.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">Of course, it wasn&#x2019;t just the skill that increased his physical strength.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He needed to practice constantly for a long time.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He mainly used bags filled with sand.&#xA0;</span><span style="">However, if someone saw him using a weapon then he would be arrested immediately, which was why he had to intentionally go to places without any people to practice.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Eh?&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">However, strange sounds started echoing in Tae-hyuk&#x2019;s secret hideaway. &#xA0;</span><span style="">He heard somebody&#x2019;s voice.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Huh? So what? Give me your money.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I-I don&#x2019;t h...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Are you going to make me look for it? Take it out quickly.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;R-Really...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ah. This son of a bitch! I feel like hitting you. Do you want your eyes to be crushed?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk coughed at that moment.&#xA0;</span><span style="">His hideout had a few gangsters roaming around.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Eh? That is my school uniform? I&#x2019;ve never seen that face before. A freshman?&#x2019;</span></p><p><i><span style="">Jjak!</span></i></p><p><span style="">At that time, one of the man slapped the boy&#x2019;s cheek.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The boy held his red cheek and screamed,</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I-I was wrong. I-I really don&#x2019;t have money. I&#x2019;ll go home and bring it to you. Yes? Please.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;This bastard. He wants to go to hell.&#x201D;</span></p><p><i><span style="">Bam!</span></i></p><p><span style="">One of the thugs kicked the boy&#x2019;s thighs with his combat boots.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The boy screamed and fell on the ground.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Fuck. Do we look like young kids roaming around? My Hyung-nim is in Nuclear Bomb. Take care of this son of a bitch.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Aaaagh!&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">The gangsters pushed the boy into a corner and started to step on him.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk frowned.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It seemed a bit too much if they simply wanted money.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;I guess they haven&#x2019;t joined a gang yet.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">In order to join such places, they needed to prove their manliness, and what they were doing now was also a part of it.</span></p><p><span style="">&apos;Well, I should leave and report this to the police.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">Although it was a bit intense, it wasn&#x2019;t enough for the boy to lose his life.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Recently, Tae-hyuk had seen many heinous crimes.</span></p><p><span style="">Maybe that was why...&#xA0;</span><span style="">This type of thing seemed like kids playing around.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Eh? Who the fuck is that?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The gangsters noticed that there was an uninvited guest.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Aigoo. Busted.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk clicked his tongue and approached the gangsters.&#xA0;</span><span style="">One person, who seemed to be the leader, frowned at Tae-hyuk.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The veins in his neck started pulsing.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hey, you son of a bitch. Did you call a friend? Huh? Tell me, who is this?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The leader kicked the abdomen of the boy on the ground.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was like wind emerging from a balloon.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Keook...!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The boy gave a pained moan.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Aigoo. You should be careful. If you hit the wrong place then his intestines might burst. Even if you are a minor... Eh? How old are you? Are you a minor?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Fuck, what is this bastard saying?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The gangsters were upset at Tae-hyuk&#x2019;s mocking tone and instantly surrounded him.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Tae-hyuk scratched his head and replied,</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;...Aigoo. Sorry Eun-young. I won&#x2019;t be able to keep my promise.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Sorry, today is your memorial service.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The leader gave instructions to his men.&#xA0;</span><span style="">They were good in a 1 on 1 fight, but they were confident in their numbers.</span></p><p><i><span style="">Peok!</span></i></p><p><span style="">At that moment, a blunt sound resonated throughout the building.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Tae-hyuk suddenly held a large iron pipe in his hands, and swung it at one of the gangsters.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;......&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The guy couldn&#x2019;t even scream before he collapsed.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was a ridiculous power.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;T-This bastard...!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The leader was dismayed.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The opponent clearly hadn&#x2019;t been carrying anything.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Then where did he get such a devastating weapon?&#xA0;</span><span style="">In addition, he was familiar with assaulting people with an iron pipe.</span></p><p><span style="">The gangsters got goose bumps.&#xA0;</span><span style="">They realized that Tae-hyuk&#x2019;s eyes were like a hyena&#x2019;s.&#xA0;</span><span style="">However, they had the tenacity of gangsters.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The leader pulled out a knife.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I will kill you...!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Aigoo. You are holding the knife like a sword. Do you watch a lot of movies? By the way, you can never beat an opponent with a longer reach than you.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk narrowed the distance at once and aimed his iron pipe at the leader&#x2019;s arm.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Keooook!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The leader&#x2019;s arm twisted in a strange direction.&#xA0;</span><span style="">From then on, it was a one-sided battle.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk had won the battle against Han Sang-won, who had specialized in knives.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The power of the iron pipe and the Violence skill was enormous.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He could even win if he took on half a dozen neighbourhood thugs.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Well, a 17 on 1 is still impossible.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk rummaged through the pockets of the gangsters on the ground.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Folded bills emerged, most of them taken from nearby students.&#xA0;</span><span style="">They had gathered almost 500,000 won.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk put one third of it into the pocket of the male student to pay for his medical expenses.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Of course, he took the rest as his share.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Tae-hyuk stuffed the bills into his pocket and muttered.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;This is better than a part time job. By the way, should I call the police and maybe the ambulance? By the way, I think it is best to fight against others using the Violence skill.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">There was a different feeling than when he hit the sandbags.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He was often bored so this wouldn&#x2019;t be too bad as a part-time job.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;The bad group is called Nuclear Bomb?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">He had a feeling he would continue to engage with them in the future.</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p>
