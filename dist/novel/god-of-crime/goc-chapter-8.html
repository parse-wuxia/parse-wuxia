The salary difference was significant.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">She had argued that she could send Tae-min to a private cram school with that money.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">However, even Tae-min had opposed her, so she was forced to surrender.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">What could be done when Tae-min said that his brain was too good to go to a cram school</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">?</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Of course, he had to suffer a headlock from Tae-hyuk who was standing next to him.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Ha-ran was now able to have some personal time.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Whether it was because of the time to relax or the move, Ha-ran&#x2019;s cough had disappeared completely. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Tae-hyuk smiled warmly at that.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Then</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#xA0;the second change...</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">He now had a family to greet him when he came home.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Tae-hyuk moved quickly.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Noona would be waiting for him to eat dinner.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x2018;By the way. I never thought that Kang-suk hyung would donate all the reward money...&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Originally, a detective wasn&#x2019;t supposed to receive the bounty money. It was likely to be construed as a bribe.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Out of the 200 million won that Tae-hyuk had received, he had given 100 million to Kang-suk.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Yet Kang-suk had donated all the reward money from the Sungjin Group to an orphanage.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Tae-hyuk had asked why he didn&#x2019;t use it for his marriage funds and Kang-suk had simply laughed.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Kang-suk had watched the children playing on the playground and said</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">,</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;They are the only ones who would want to marry me</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">, so</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#xA0;it seems like I will have to wait 10 years.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;Wah. A detective is trying to commit a crime.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">This was because&#xA0;</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Kang-suk was really popular with the children.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Kang-suk had laughed and said this was enough.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">There were only idiots around Tae-hyuk.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x2018;Come to think of it. I haven&#x2019;t received any crime skills in the past week.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">There was still a long time until the next incident on the blacklist. He thought about using that time to pull back the veil of the demon mirror.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x2018;Ah, right. I decided to call it the Demon Revealing Mirror.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">It was the magic mirror that illuminated the true image of a demon.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">He had recently discovered that the success rate of Robbery was around 10%.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">However,</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#xA0;it was good at stealing strange things</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">, such as:</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">A wig</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">; h</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">andcuffs</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">;</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">p</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">ant</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">ies</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">...</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Forget it.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">He still didn&#x2019;t know how to get skills and affinity points, nor did he know the identity of the Demon Revealing Mirror.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&apos;Damn</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">, t</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">hat pseudo bastard.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">He had taken it to a shaman who was famous in dealing with demon-possessed items.
