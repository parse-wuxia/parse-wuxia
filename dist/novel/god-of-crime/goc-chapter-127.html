<p><span style="">Chapter 127 - Swallow the Sun #5</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p><p><span style="">In the base of the Sun Cult, there was a secret room that ordinary people couldn&#x2019;t enter.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was called the Temple of Heaven, and no one could enter except for the leader and the bishops.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was full of things that couldn&#x2019;t be shown to other people.</span></p><p><span style="">In this place, Cho Min-hyuk and the three bishops were looking at each other with blank faces.&#xA0;</span><span style="">They still didn&#x2019;t know if what they saw was a reality or a dream.</span></p><p><span style="">Song Chi-hyun, who was the oldest of the bishops, and had been there since the Sun Cult started three years old, opened his mouth first.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Surely we weren&#x2019;t drugged?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">It wasn&#x2019;t hard to believe.&#xA0;</span><span style="">They had used all types of tricks to deceive the believers.&#xA0;</span><span style="">They got information about the other person in an unnoticeable manner and used it to know of their past.&#xA0;</span><span style="">They figured out the people&#x2019;s concerns or any illnesses they had.</span></p><p><span style="">Song Chi-hyun had 10 years of experience as a magician.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Most of the tricks that the cult used came from his head.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He used magic to create miracles such as levitating in air or removing a tumor from his abdomen.&#xA0;</span><span style="">In other words, they were tricks that came from the head.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was quite good.</span></p><p><span style="">In the end, Sun became one of the nation&#x2019;s top religious groups just three years after its creation.&#xA0;</span><span style="">But now the real thing appeared...</span></p><p><span style="">Park Bum-ho, who was treated as the fake Pungbaek after the real one appeared, said,</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;L-Leader... He really...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">He was particularly agitated.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Damn. No matter how I look at it, he is real.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I-Isn&#x2019;t it the setting that I made?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Huu...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Park Bum-ho was a manhwa writer whose work didn&#x2019;t sell.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He prepared a story based on Gojoseon, but he hadn&#x2019;t been able to find an artist, so he plunged into suffering.&#xA0;</span><span style="">That&#x2019;s when the leader scouted him.</span></p><p><span style="">Although many parts of Park Bum-ho&#x2019;s setting were awkward, he had the strange power to attract people.&#xA0;</span><span style="">In particular, he was en expert at penetrating the mentality of a person.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Pungbaek&#x2019;s abilities could be set up. In particular, we had a plan to change the face and clothes that hadn&#x2019;t been revealed yet.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">In order to actually do it, they needed to figure out a way to change the mask on the face in an instant.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Unsa Kim Jin-woo, who was in charge of the camera installation and eavesdropping, gave his opinion.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;...I analyzed the footage of that person. I couldn&#x2019;t find any traces of a trick.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Cho Min-hyuk asked Song Chi-hyun to show them his belly and looked closely.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The image of a vast amount of blood spurting from it could still be seen in their minds.&#xA0;</span><span style="">However, the wound was like he had never been stabbed at all.</span></p><p><span style="">Cho Min-hyuk asked,</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;You didn&#x2019;t pretend to be stabbed with a fake knife right? There also wasn&#x2019;t plastic bag of blood either, right?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes... I can guarantee it. I was clearly stabbed by a knife. If you take a closer look, my blood stains are still here.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Song Chi-hyun showed them the knife that had stabbed him.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The blood had disappeared, but the traces still remained.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Damn... What the hell...?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Did a celestial being really appear in the setting that Park Bum-ho created?</span><span style="">Fortunately, the person hadn&#x2019;t said that they were fakes.&#xA0;</span><span style="">They were just worried about how Sun would operate in the future.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Leader. First, let&#x2019;s assume that he really is a celestial being.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I think this is right.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The leaders came to a conclusion at the end of an one hour meeting.&#xA0;</span><span style="">First of all, they would cooperate with the heavenly being as much as possible.&#xA0;</span><span style="">They couldn&#x2019;t give up the Sun group.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was literally the goose that laid the golden egg.</span></p><p><span style="">At first, they asked the believers to give up the goods they had accumulated.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Then they could get some peace of mind.&#xA0;</span><span style="">However, that didn&#x2019;t last long.</span></p><p><span style="">It was natural.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was because they lived an unhappy life that they joined the cult in the first place.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Just removing the cause wouldn&#x2019;t stop them from feeling unhappy.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Then they would once again have to give something up in order to get some rest. Thus, an endless chain began.</span></p><p><span style="">Once the berries were ripe, they would be harvested.</span></p><p><span style="">Song Chi-hyun said,</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;The good news is that the celestial being treats Leader-nim as a fellow god.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;It really is fortunate. At that moment, I really thought I was the reincarnation of a celestial being. No, maybe...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Leader, I&#x2019;m sorry but let&#x2019;s start with the worst case scenario. Maybe you will have to hand over your position to him.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hrmm...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The leader being advised to retire from his position.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It wasn&#x2019;t a pleasant feeling.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;There is one good thing. Pungbaek doesn&#x2019;t have the ability to read a person&#x2019;s mind. You know what that means.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Song Chi-hyun listened to the leader&#x2019;s words and muttered,</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;We can fool him?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes. That person is looking for other celestial beings. We can use that as an excuse to expand Sun.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The bishops nodded at their leader, who managed to turn the crisis of retirement around.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;You want to create a huge group.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;That&apos;s right. Think about it realistically. That person really can use divine techniques. Imagine if he became the leader and showed the miracles in front of all of the believers.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Haah...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Woo...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The news would spread and many new spectators would come to see the heavenly being.</span></p><p><span style="">It would work.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It had to work.</span></p><p><span style="">Right now, they only had 1,200 believers.&#xA0;</span><span style="">That could increase by 10, no 100 or even 1,000 times.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Even if it is only half...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;What do you think about my idea?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The scammers raised their thumbs.</span></p><p><span style="">@</span></p><p><span style="">As the group was plotting, Tae-hyuk was preoccupied with other things.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He needed to find definite proof that the Sun Cult was related to the Yakuza.&#xA0;</span><span style="">First of all, he decided to check the incense, since that was the only connection point.</span></p><p><span style="">He asked the person who moved the supplies and found out that there was a warehouse they were stored in.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The guard was someone who hadn&#x2019;t been able to attend the rally a few hours ago.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He sat in his chair and played on his smartphone, as if he didn&#x2019;t know that a real celestial being had appeared.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk used Disguise to turn into Song Chi-hyun.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Although his height was a little shorter, a man&#x2019;s height could change depending on the situation.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Hum hum.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk coughed and the guard raised his head with an annoyed expression.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Then he used as he realized that Bishop Song Chi-hyun was in front of him.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;B-B-B-Bishop-nim!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">His reaction was like a soldier meeting his commanding office while he had been dozing off.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;You went through a lot of trouble. I need more incense at the rally.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I-Is that so? Normally the others come directly...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I am tired from waking up at down. I thought a walk would be good for me so don&#x2019;t think too hard. Then can I go in?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The guard could only say one thing in response.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Yes! You worked hard!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The guard bowed low, like a broken robot.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He wouldn&#x2019;t be brave enough to take a look inside.</span></p><p><span style="">The warehouse was filled with a variety of props, like it was the set of a historical drama.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I can film a drama with the things here.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The incense wasn&#x2019;t difficult to find.</span></p><p><span style="">However, the contents were empty.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Hrmm...&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">It seemed like he would have to use Spying to determine if there was a secret space.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Tae-hyuk activated the crime skill.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Spying!&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">Then the screen of the Demon Revealing Mirror flashed in front of Tae-hyuk.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Information about the objects in the room were written down.&#xA0;</span><span style="">This was the ability of the Hawk Eyes attribute.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Here.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk approached a jar placed in a corner of the room.&#xA0;</span><span style="">A safe was hidden behind it.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;This won&#x2019;t open without fingerprint recognition.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">First of all, he gained Cho Min-hyuk&#x2019;s fingerprints using Counterfeit.&#xA0;</span><span style="">However, there was no reaction from the safe.</span></p><p><span style="">Next he tried Song Chi-hyun and Park Bum-ho.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;It looks like Kim Jin-woo is in charge of this.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">He used the thumbprint of Kim Jin-woo and the safe door opened with a loud clunk.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk smiled.</span></p><p><span style="">Recently, the number of fingerprint recognition safes had increased over the dial or lock type.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was much harder for other thieves, but Tae-hyuk was the opposite.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;I don&#x2019;t have the skill to pick a lock yet. I&#x2019;m feel sorry since I&#x2019;m always getting its help, so I should buy some stock in companies that make fingerprint recognition locks.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk looked into the safe and as he thought, there was a glass bottle of perfume.</span></p><p><span style="">He sniffed the sweet scent.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was definitely &#x2018;that.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Then let&#x2019;s see the source of this.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk pulled out a notebook and pencil.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He would prefer a proper easel or drawing sheet but there was no time.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Then Forgery...!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">[The Forgery skill has found an intense image.]</span></p><p><span style="">[The work has been completed through automatic mode.]</span></p><p><span style="">The familiar intense illusion appeared in front of Tae-hyuk&#x2019;s eyes.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was the hidden ability of Forgery that helped him many times.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The secret deal between the Yakuza and bishops was drawn inside the notebook.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The atmosphere was enough to use it as a poster for a crime movie.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Bingo. The Yakuza was behind the Sun Cult.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk was able to close the notebook when he saw someone drawn in the corner.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He looked like he was in control of the transaction, but he felt strangely familiar.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hrmm... This person...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Anyway, he could ask the bishops if he was curious.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Tae-hyuk took the perfume from the safe and quietly left the warehouse.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He had everything he wanted.</span></p><p><span style="">Now it was time to strike.</span></p><p><span style="">@</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk took the appearance of the celestial being and gave orders to the leader and bishops.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He told them to gather the members of Sun into a room so that he could introduce himself formally.</span></p><p><span style="">It would be the celestial being&#x2019;s first public appearance.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The cult leaders who heard this couldn&#x2019;t help laughing.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;T-Those words...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes. It is my job to look after the members here. I can&#x2019;t promise forever, but I will lead them as long as possible.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Kim Jin-woo murmured in a touched tone,</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;P-Pungbaek...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Then Song Chi-hyun said,</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Pungbaek. It is sad but there are still many believers who don&#x2019;t believe that Pungbaek is a celestial being. Then can you please show us a miracle again?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Of course.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ohh... T-Thank you. So I will get it ready.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk laughed and didn&#x2019;t say anything.</span></p><p><span style="">The bishops accepted and the rally to introduce &#x2018;Pungbaek&#x2019; was organized in an instant.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Thousands of believers gathered in an auditorium.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Rumours of Pungbaek started to spread among them.</span></p><p><span style="">It was all staged by Song Chi-hyun.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Aren&#x2019;t we gathered today to be introduced to the real Pungbaek?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Eh? So the Pungbaek we met until now...?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;He was just a proxy while the real Pungbaek was away. Maybe he will get another position?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I see. Then what will Pungbaek show us?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The believers looked up at the podium with excited faces as their expectations grew.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Then Song Chi-hyun appeared on stage.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I am here to introduce you to Pungbaek, who has been ruling the winds of the world for thousands of years.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">It was like he was introducing a magician.&#xA0;</span><span style="">But the public was excited about the obvious direction.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Eh? The clouds...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;P-Pungbaek!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The clouds gathered together on stage and revealed one person.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It seemed like a figure from the myths was appearing.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was enough to cause the crowd in the auditorium to cheer.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Some followers even shed tears.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;It is really Pungbaek...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;P-Pungbaek! Please save us!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Please lead us, Pungbaek!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk walked towards the microphone on the stage.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He truly was like a magician.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;I am a magician without a stage crew.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk clicked his tongue.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;After thousands of years, I am able to appear in front of you thanks to Hwanin. I...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk stopped for a moment and looked at the crowd.&#xA0;</span><span style="">They were gazing at Tae-hyuk with hopeful eyes as they wished for a miracle.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Even though thousands of people were gathered, it was so quiet that not even the sound of breathing could be heard.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;I will give them a miracle like they wished. However, it will be a little different from what they want.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk slowly opened his mouth and said...</span></p><p><span style="">@</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Once Pungbaek opened his mouth, the Sun group was literally decimated. Isn&#x2019;t this a miracle?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk smiled as he left the auditorium.</span></p><p><span style="">He told the believers that the leader and bishops were fakes.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Once he recalled what happened in there, his stomach hurt again.</span></p><p><span style="">Who would have imagined?&#xA0;</span><span style="">Ridiculous words had emerged from the mouth of the person called the celestial being.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Get the scammer!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;That bastard is running away!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Several hundred people were running around the building trying to catch Tae-hyuk, but they couldn&#x2019;t find any signs of him.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Originally I didn&#x2019;t look like that.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">He released the disguise of the celestial being. Then he pretended to be searching as well.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Surely they won&#x2019;t notice that two of the same people are searching. I won&#x2019;t have to worry about it if I enter another building.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk pretended to be searching while looking at the Demon Revealing Mirror.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Then he muttered,</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;This has definitely changed the fate of the Sun group. Then give me the reward.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">How many affinity points would he get?</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk stared at the Demon Revealing Mirror.</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p>
