<p><span style="">Chapter 85 - Genius and Genius #1</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p><p><span style="">The newly acquired Disguise skill had one fatal drawback.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Tae-hyuk muttered as he stared at Kim Bum-soo&#x2019;s face in the mirror.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;This just changes the face?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">It would be okay if he disguised as a man of a similar height while wearing thick clothes, but it would be creepy if he had a woman&#x2019;s face with the body of a man below the shoulders.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was obviously a great ability, but some things still couldn&#x2019;t be helped.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;That means that if I disguise as a Hollywood actor, I still won&#x2019;t have the muscular body.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">At first, he could only change his voice using Voice Modulation.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Then it evolved into changing his face with Disguise.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Then at the end, would he be able to change his body?</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Cough... Won&#x2019;t that be a transformation rather than a disguise? It would be a big hit like X-ray Vision.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Upgrading his rank gave him the opportunity to strengthen his skills.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He had already started to wonder how his other skills would change.&#xA0;</span><span style="">But he had to first investigate the skill he gained this time.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;First of all, I need to find out how long Disguise lasts.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">In the case of Voice Modulation, it was okay to keep his mouth shut if his voice suddenly returned to normal.&#xA0;</span><span style="">However, that wasn&#x2019;t the case with his face.&#xA0;</span><span style="">If he made a mistake, then he would be arrested immediately.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk, who had Kim Bum-soo&#x2019;s face, looked at himself in the mirror and made several facial expressions.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Kim Bum-soo was an actor who could change between dozens of expressions freely.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk spoke his famous line,</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;How dare you destroy the 500 year history of the Goryeo Dynasty!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">He could act out a drama by speaking in a different voice.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Acting is possible.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">He did a few more lines before looking at the time.&#xA0;</span><span style="">After 30 minutes, he returned to his original face.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;This is the limit right now? I have to be careful.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">It seemed he would have to carry a timer to tell him the time limit for Disguise.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Next, he changed his face to people he met such as Yoo Cheol-ho, Park Sung-kwang, and Choi Sung-yeol.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Then he tried some nice faces.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I-I can&#x2019;t tell Big Mama and Moonlight Flower about this.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The proficiency test was sufficient.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk had shattered T Medical Center around a week ago.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Obviously, it was one of the business sites managed by the Chinese mafia, &#x2018;the Triads.&#x2019;&#xA0;</span><span style="">Furthermore, he appeared on TV under the name Phantom.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The video had spread around various streaming sites and received hundreds of thousands of views.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;It is highly likely that the Triads is prepared for war.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk lived in prison and was exposed to information that the public didn&#x2019;t know about.&#xA0;</span><span style="">One of them was the Mafia War that occurred around two years later.</span></p><p><span style="">The Triads, who secretly infiltrated Korea, was enjoying enormous profits.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The Russian mob and Japanese Yakuza then mobilized their forces to fight them.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Thus, the criminals of three countries waged a war in South Korea.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk had smashed one of the businesses of the Triad, which could be considered as the starting point of the war.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">He didn&#x2019;t know what effect it would have, even with Tae-hyuk&#x2019;s future knowledge.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The so-called butterfly effect, a scientific theory stating that a butterfly flapping its wings in Brazil might generate a tornado in Texas.&#xA0;</span><span style="">In addition, Tae-hyuk&#x2019;s actions weren&#x2019;t at the level of a butterfly flapping its wings, but a devastating tornado.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Then the result might be even more destructive.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Either way, I need to pay close attention to the movements of the Triads.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Once all the tests were finished, Tae-hyuk wore his leather jacket and left the house.&#xA0;</span><span style="">First of all, he needed to keep his promise with An Eun-young.</span></p><p><span style="">@</span></p><p><span style="">Joo Hyun-ho met with a professor of criminology at his alma mater, S University.</span></p><p><span style="">The female professor laughed as she looked at her best pupil.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Then I would like to ask you to do the freshmen orientation.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">S University would hold an orientation for their freshmen in the middle of February.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The schedule included inviting graduates to give a lecture on their related occupation.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The person who would shine this year was Joo Hyun-ho, the genius investigator who solved many cases.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I have plenty of time.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;But aren&#x2019;t the police in an uproar due to Phantom?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Joo Hyun-ho shook his head.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;It is the first time I&#x2019;ve seen such a disruptive criminal. Countless people took off their clothes because of him.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Then isn&#x2019;t Investigator Joo Hyun-ho also in danger?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;It isn&#x2019;t too bad if I can play and eat at home.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;As expected of a building owner... I suppose I can get you a job as a security guard here if you retire.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Haha...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Then do you have a schedule after this?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Ah, I am going to visit my school club for the first time in a while.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The young professor nodded.&#xA0;</span><span style="">She wanted to have a meal with her pupil, whom she hadn&#x2019;t seen in a long time, but Hyun-ho didn&#x2019;t realize this fact.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He understood the psychology of criminals but had no understanding of women.&#xA0;</span><span style="">If possible, she wanted to teach him for a few more years.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Then go after having a drink. If you wait then my assistant will bring it.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes, I understand.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">While waiting, Joo Hyun-ho used his smartphone to look up the T Medical Center case.&#xA0;</span><span style="">As for the related terms, more than half of it was about the criminal wearing the opera mask, Phantom.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Despite the fact that the article was just published, there were hundreds of comments already.</span></p><p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">Amazing.</span></i> <i><span style="">Then they kidnapped orphans and sold their organs?&#x3137; &#x3137; &#x3137;</span></i></p><p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">It is good that the scum died.</span></i></p><p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">Yes.</span></i> <i><span style="">Even if they were arrested by the police, they would just be sent home.</span></i></p><p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">I&#x2019;ve watched Phantom&#x2019;s video 20 times already.</span></i></p><p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">By the way, didn&#x2019;t his voice strangely sound like Kim Bum-soo?</span></i><span style="">&#x3147; &#x3148;? </span></p><p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">In the end, isn&#x2019;t he just a murderer?</span></i> <i><span style="">I don&#x2019;t understand why people are regarding him as a hero.</span></i></p><p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">He didn&#x2019;t kill them himself so how is he a murderer?</span></i> <i><span style="">Besides, he caught the criminals that the police couldn&#x2019;t.</span></i> <i><span style="">Isn&#x2019;t that great?</span></i></p><p><span style="">The debate about Phantom was constantly ongoing.</span></p><p><span style="">Joo Hyun-ho sighed.</span></p><p><span style="">It was such a perfect defeat that he couldn&#x2019;t even feel resentful.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He conducted an investigation to catch the culprit who decorated a tree with dead bodies. &#xA0;</span><span style="">However, what he thought was a bizarre mutilation murder was actually organ trafficking.</span></p><p><span style="">He had been able to solve Ryu Myung-hwa&#x2019;s disappearance, but that was only due to Cho Kang-suk&#x2019;s senses.&#xA0;</span><span style="">In the end, Joo Hyun-ho had done nothing in this case.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Hu... I should return the title of genius investigator&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">At that time, the assistant knocked and entered with cups of coffee.&#xA0;</span><span style="">After drinking it, Joo Hyun-ho stood up and said,</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Thank you. Then I will be going now.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ah... Thank you for today, Investigator Joo Hyun-ho.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;No, thank you for agreeing.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Joo Hyun-ho decided to take a walk around the campus to sort out his complicated head.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Phantom...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">An unidentified criminal who suddenly appeared.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Although the media only knew about the trafficking case, he had been active for a while before.&#xA0;</span><span style="">His first appearance was when he caught the Hippo for the police.</span></p><p><span style="">It was also clear that Phantom was the one who saved Jung Yuri.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Joo Hyun-ho had met with Jung Yuri and asked what happened, but she only replied that she couldn&#x2019;t remember.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;There is obviously something.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The Phantom had bombs containing immense destruction.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He was a criminal that absolutely had to be arrested, but his whereabouts were unknown.&#xA0;</span><span style="">In the end, it was a situation where only the bottom tier employees suffered.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ohh... Damn!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Joo Hyun-ho, whose head was hurting, kicked a stone on the ground.&#xA0;</span><span style="">As he glanced up, he saw a man and woman who seemed to be high school students.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The man was in plain clothes but the woman was wearing a uniform.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Maybe it was a field trip to the university.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;T-Tae-hyuk. There is an art exhibition. Robots will also be displayed there.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Great. Let&#x2019;s go see it together.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I-Is that so? Yes, let&#x2019;s go.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The male high school student was looking around with a nonchalant expression, but the female high school student couldn&#x2019;t keep her eyes away from the man&#x2019;s face.</span></p><p><span style="">Joo Hyun-ho laughed at the sight.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Why couldn&#x2019;t the male student notice when it was just so obvious?</span></p><p><span style="">At this point, Joo Hyun-ho and the high school students passed by each other.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Then the girl lost her balance and stumbled.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Joo Hyun-ho reflexively reached out and caught her shoulder.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was the same with the male student.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Joo Hyun-ho and the male student&#x2019;s hands touched for a brief moment.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The girl bowed with a sorry expression,</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ah... I&#x2019;m sorry. I think it was due to a stone.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Haha, it&#x2019;s nothing.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">It seemed like she wasn&#x2019;t paying to her feet while looking at the man&#x2019;s face.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Class President. Are you hurt anywhere?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Uhh. I&#x2019;m fine.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Joo Hyun-ho looked at the male student, who was wearing a leather jacket.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was an appearance that didn&#x2019;t look neat.</span></p><p><span style="">At that time, the man said something,</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;You seem to have dropped this.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Ah, when did that fall?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I think it fell when we bumped into you just now. Then we will be going.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Joo Hyun-ho scratched his head.</span></p><p><span style="">He thought it had been placed securely in his Burberry coat.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;It would be bad if I lost this. Thanks for picking it up. Are you touring the campus?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The female student replied,</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes. I will be attending next year.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;It is January yet you already passed? Isn&#x2019;t that great?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hehehe...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;In fact, I am a graduate of this school. If you don&#x2019;t mind, would you like me to guide you around?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Is it okay?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Joo Hyun-ho looked at her and said,</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I heard by chance. Did you want to go to the art exhibition? I know the curator there. If you go with me then you&apos;ll be able to see a little more. &quot;</span></p><p><span style="">At that moment, the male student&#x2019;s eyes flashed.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;We can see it in detail?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes. It is impossible to touch but you can look at it directly. Think of it as the price for a police investigator not noticing that his police badge dropped. Ah right. I am Joo Hyun-ho.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;An Eun-young.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I am Seo Tae-hyuk.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The three people who met by chance introduced themselves to each other, but their meeting wasn&#x2019;t a coincidence.</span></p><p><span style="">@</span></p><p><span style="">The young boss of Huaqing, one of the 12 branches of the Triads, listened to the report from his subordinates.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Then in the end, the whole place didn&#x2019;t blow up?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Yes, Boss.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">It was the title for the leader of the organization.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;The culprit is this bastard.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Li Zheng watched the video of Phantom on his laptop and muttered.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He had lost a business that earned him billions of dollars every year because of some stupid bastard.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Li Zheng was furious.</span></p><p><span style="">The leader of his subordinates asked him,</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What would you like to do?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;He killed seven of our people. It can only be repaid with blood.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I understand.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I will give you a month. Present the Phantom&#x2019;s head to me. And this time, bring Big Brother.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Li Zheng glared at his subordinates as he spoke,</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;B-Big Brother?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style=""> &#x201C;Yes.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;B-But he...!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">His subordinate&#x2019;s voice shook with fear.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Big Brother was the best killer in Huaqing.&#xA0;</span><span style="">However, he was cruel and violent so he wasn&#x2019;t easily handled.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It showed how angry Boss was due to this incident.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;We have to catch Phantom even if we burn Korea in the process. That is my, no. Huaqing&#x2019;s will!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;As Boss commands!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">His subordinate bowed to Li Zheng before gathering the other members.</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p>
