<p><span style="">Chapter 64 - Bomber #2 &#xA0;</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p><p><span style="">The hint of the location of the second bomb was hidden in a riddle.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The police groaned after hearing it, but the remaining time was tight.&#xA0;</span><span style="">They had to solve this mystery...</span></p><p><span style="">If they couldn&#x2019;t cope with this then they would be helpless like in the Atlantis situation.&#xA0;</span><span style="">These words were said just before the tape ended.</span></p><p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">Oh right.</span></i> <i><span style="">Isn&#x2019;t it courteous to leave a nickname for you to call me?</span></i> <i><span style="">You can call me the Bomber.</span></i> <i><span style="">Then I wish you luck.</span></i></p><p><span style="">In the end, this incident was called the Bomber case.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Kim Do-shik asked the police who were standing around.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Fuck. Do you know where this is?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I-I&#x2019;m really sorry...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I&#x2019;m not sure.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Cho Kang-suk sighed slowly.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He knew of a professional at these types of things.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Although Kang-suk was reluctant, he was confident in that person&#x2019;s abilities.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It seemed like this time as well, he would have to ask that brat for help.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Inspector. Let&#x2019;s ask Investigator Joo Hyun-ho for advice.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Ah, yes. Where is he now!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Due to the hippo incident, he was dispatched to Kangdong Police Station.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Don&#x2019;t report everything and call him immediately!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Joo Hyun-ho arrived where everyone was gathered in exactly three minutes.</span></p><p><span style="">He was wearing a trench coat and seemed to have come in a hurry.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was the same style as Detective Columbo, whom he admired.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He had run here as fast as he could.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was like watching a high school student going to the athletic field during P.E.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hahaha! I am qualified in this case.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Kang-suk had given a rough overview of the case over the phone in advance.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Kim Do-shik&#x2019;s eyes flashed as he spoke to Hyun-ho.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Investigator Joo. Just like you got the hippo last time, please solve this case!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Kim Do-shik&#x2019;s eyes were full of trust.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Joo Hyun-ho scratched his head,</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;As I wrote in the report, someone who Kang-suk sunbae and I don&#x2019;t know was the one who caught the hippo. We just happened to be there.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">While he was the type of person who treated investigations as a game, he wasn&#x2019;t the type to claim another person&#x2019;s merits.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;But it is true that you were in the place where the hippo committed the crime and saved the victim. That is good enough.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Thank you. First, let me focus on this case.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;You two are the best talents in our Kangdong Police Station. I believe in you.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Kang-suk laughed as he was combined with Hyun-ho.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Hyun-ho touched his glasses and read the memo containing the clue of the bomb.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Then he spoke not even a minute later,</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I solved it. I know where the bomb is placed. Request assistance straight away.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What, already?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The riddle almost completely filled the A4 paper.&#xA0;</span><span style="">That wasn&#x2019;t quick enough to read everything written there.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Yet he had solved it?&#xA0;</span><span style="">Kim Do-shik looked at Joo Hyun-ho in disbelief.</span></p><p><span style="">Joo Hyun-ho pulled a pen from his pocket, highlighted a few words and handed it to Kim Do-shik.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;It&#x2019;s mostly junk information that&#x2019;s designed to blur what really matters.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Immediately after that, Kim Do-shik asked for support from SWAT and the special bomb disposal squads.</span></p><p><span style="">Then Hyun-ho explained.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;28 devices not connected refers to these words, not the bombs. Do you know what I mean?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ah! Hunminjeongeum?&#x201D; (<a href="en.wikipedia.org">Google Link</a>. Hyun-ho is probably referring to the 28 letters of hangul, the Korean alphabet that was created)</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;And words are created. In the end, this sentence points to King Sejong. And the next words are bank, learning and Confucian scholar. That means Sungkyunkwan University.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ohh...!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;The sentence itself is roughly a middle school grade inscription pun. The important thing is that at least three or more words per paragraph point to the same thing.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;T-That&apos;s right. Then the bomb is hidden at Sungkyunkwan University? Do you know the exact position?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The university was incredibly large.&#xA0;</span><span style="">In addition, it wasn&#x2019;t in one place but spread across various regions.&#xA0;</span><span style="">There was the humanities and social sciences campus of Sungkyunkwan University in Myeongyun-dong, Jongno-gu, Seoul.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The natural sciences campus was in Suwon.</span></p><p><span style="">If it was the latter, then it would be hard to cope with the problem from Seoul.&#xA0;</span><span style="">They needed to know the exact location.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;There is a word in the middle of the sentence &#x2018;the wind blows, the tree blossoms in spring.&#x2019; It looks to be pointing to a tree, but it is actually talking about the blue dragon. Among the five attributes, blue means wood, spring and wind. And as a symbol of Sungkyunkwan University&#x2019;s bank is a blue dragon.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Kim Do-shik&#x2019;s eyes widened at Joo Hyun-ho&#x2019;s tremendous reasoning power.&#xA0;</span><span style="">A police officer heard it and asked.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;But isn&#x2019;t that also referring to Sungkyunkwan University? So there is no change.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Joo Hyun-ho shook his head.</span></p><p><span style="">The blue dragon clearly meant Sungkyunkwan University, but there was something different.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Of course, we can also see it like that. But to be precise, it is the symbol of Sungkyunkwan University&#x2019;s bank. There is a legend related to the blue dragon. Therefore, it is considered symbolic to have a blue dragon statue. It is a symbol but isn&#x2019;t a symbol, but that isn&#x2019;t what it means. The place with a blue dragon statue. The bomb will obviously be there.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;W-Where is that?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Wait a moment. I don&#x2019;t know everything.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Joo Hyun-ho laughed and pulled out his smartphone to look it up.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It took 10 seconds for the information to appear.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I have sent the exact location to your phone.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Kim Do-shik saw the result of the search on his phone and issued orders in a loud voice.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Call the Myeongnyun personnel right now! The bomb is in the blue dragon statue at the front gate!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes, I understand!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Kang-suk was ready to move.&#xA0;</span><span style="">By the way, he couldn&#x2019;t see Joo Hyun-ho, who usually followed him like a puppy.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Eh? Hyun-ho. You&#x2019;re not following.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Hyun-ho had taken off his coat and was sitting in a corner with the tape recorder.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ah, Sunbae. I think I have to take individual action this time. I want to try an analysis of the tape.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Kang-suk nodded.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Unlike himself, who specialized in jumping in, Hyun-ho was an expert in analyzing the opponent.&#xA0;</span><span style="">They had to do what they did best.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I&#x2019;ll let you know if there is anything else. I&#x2019;ll call you on your phone.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Uh, yes. Please do so.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The police moved in search of the bomb.</span></p><p><span style="">@</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Everybody, please evacuate according to the instructions!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Hundreds of police officers came to Sungkyunkwan University.&#xA0;</span><span style="">There was a frenzy among the university students walking around the school.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What? What? Evacuation? A-All of a sudden...?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Is this some type of army reservist training?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Then armed police rushed through the hall and told the students.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;It is real. Please evacuate now.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Haha... What, is this a war?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;It is similar. I can&#x2019;t tell you anything else. Please hurry up!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;...Yes, I understand.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">No matter how weak the public perception, the dignity of the uniformed police officers was enormous.&#xA0;</span><span style="">There was no student who resisted.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Although it was a little cluttered, the evacuation was carried out without any problems.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Now, now, there is no need to shove. Please stand in a row over here.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The reservists who shone at this time.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Using their experience in evacuation training that they received in the army, the reservists took action and led the other students.</span></p><p><span style="">Cho Kang-suk sighed with relief as he watched the scene.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;No students will be damaged. It is fortunate.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Usually in movies, the people in the area would be evacuated if there was a bomb threat.&#xA0;</span><span style="">By the way, an explosion would occur even before the time limit was reached.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Did this bomber have some conscience remaining?</span></p><p><span style="">Fortunately, due to Joo Hyun-ho&#x2019;s reasoning, there were still 10 minutes until the scheduled explosion.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was enough to deal with the bomb.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He hoped that there would be no damage.</span></p><p><span style="">At that moment, the SWAT team started approaching the blue dragon statue.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;There is a bomb!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Kang-suk sighed.</span></p><p><span style="">All he had to do was catch the criminal.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He would leave the bomb to the professionals.</span></p><p><span style="">Kim Do-shik looked at the SWAT team with an expression of trust.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Can you do it?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes. We are professionals. Leave it to us.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">When a bomb was found in movies, there were often wires that needed to be cut.&#xA0;</span><span style="">However, that was only to increase the tension.&#xA0;</span><span style="">In fact, if a bomb was found, it was to be put in a state where it couldn&#x2019;t explode with liquid nitrogen or shock absorbers, then moved to another place to be handled.&#xA0;</span><span style="">That&#x2019;s why they were called the disposal squad, not the disassembly squad.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Uh, Inspector! This bomb has no primer!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What? It is a seedless watermelon?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Fuck, again?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Kim Do-shik spat on the ground.</span></p><p><span style="">The bomb installed here was the same as the one delivered to the police station.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was a bomb that had the power to destroy a whole building if it exploded.&#xA0;</span><span style="">But the primer had been removed, as if the bomber was teasing them.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It seemed like an armed demonstration.</span></p><p><span style="">Kim Do-shik approached the SWAT team leader and asked.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Is there a tape recorder?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Please wait a moment. Is there perhaps a tape recorder in the box?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Eh? There is!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The SWAT team leader pointed at the tape recorder that was where the primer should be.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;It is the same as the bomb delivered to the station. It would be best to listen to the contents of the tape recorder at once.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes. That&#x2019;s right.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Kim Do-shik handed it over to Cho Kang-suk.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Should Detective Cho listen?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Oh, you want to listen?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">It was burdensome but everyone knew about Kang-suk&#x2019;s achievements, so the SWAT team leader gave it up to Kang-suk.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The SWAT team leader carefully pressed the switch of the recorder.</span></p><p><i><span style="">-By listening to this message, you have found the safe bomb.</span></i> <i><span style="">Isn&#x2019;t the tutorial fun?</span></i></p><p><span style="">The people who were listening spat.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He mobilized hundreds of police for what?&#xA0;</span><span style="">Practice?</span></p><p><i><span style="">-I showed you this much to make you realize that I&#x2019;m not joking.</span></i> <i><span style="">Then I&#x2019;ll give you the next mission.</span></i> <i><span style="">This time it is real so you better hurry.</span></i></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Fuck...</span></p><p><span style="">This wasn&#x2019;t training anymore.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Kim Do-shik instructed Kang-suk.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Tell Joo Hyun-ho to come here right now. Crazy.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Only Joo Hyun-ho could solve the mystery.&#xA0;</span><span style="">They had to do this seven more times?&#xA0;</span><span style="">Furthermore, if they were late, then a deadly disaster would occur.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The nation&#x2019;s top specialists were gathered here, but tired faces had already emerged.</span></p><p><span style="">The sky was almost yellow.</span></p><p><span style="">It was at that moment.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Kim Do-shik received a phone call.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Who? It if is a prank call or spam call then I will smash them!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">He roughly pressed the call button and brought the phone to his ear and heard a familiar voice.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Unfortunately, it wasn&apos;t a spam call or prank call.</span></p><p><i><span style="">-Hello,</span></i> <i><span style="">Inspector Kim Do-shik.</span></i></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Y-you...!&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">It was the Bomber&#x2019;s voice on the phone!</span></p><p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">You sound pretty surprised...</span></i> <i><span style="">But unfortunately, I&#x2019;m not the Bomber.</span></i></p><p><span style="">&quot;......!&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Just then, the person&#x2019;s voice changed.&#xA0;</span><span style="">This time, it was a young woman&apos;s voice.</span></p><p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">Kukukuk.</span></i> <i><span style="">I&#x2019;m getting goose bumps so I guess I have to use the Bomber&#x2019;s voice.</span></i> <i><span style="">Don&#x2019;t judge me by my voice.</span></i></p><p><span style="">There were machines that could change one&#x2019;s voice, but that usually resulted in an unnatural mechanical sound.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The person on the phone wasn&#x2019;t like that.&#xA0;</span><span style="">His voice had definitely changed while speaking.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Was the other person a voice actor?</span></p><p><span style="">Kim Do-shik gulped and asked.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;This doesn&#x2019;t seem like a prank call. W-What is going on?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">I&#x2019;ll speak briefly.</span></i> <i><span style="">Right now, you...</span></i> <i><span style="">And those who are gathered are in a difficult situation.</span></i> <i><span style="">Oh, can you tell the SWAT team member next to you not to do that?</span></i></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;...Hup!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The other person spoke as if he knew the situation going on here.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The even more amazing thing was that he knew the SWAT team leader was listening to the call.</span></p><p><span style="">Kim Do-shik started sweating.</span></p><p><i><span style="">-I want to help you.</span></i> <i><span style="">I will cooperate in helping you find the bombs.</span></i> <i><span style="">Of course, it isn&#x2019;t for free like when I caught the hippo.</span></i></p><p><span style="">The hand that was holding the phone trembled.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The hippo was a secret that only the police knew about.&#xA0;</span><span style="">But this person knew...</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;H-Hippo...! Did you catch him?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">It was my first service.</span></i> <i><span style="">If you are suspicious then I will tell you about the marks that I left behind.</span></i></p><p><span style="">The other person briefly explained how the hippo was arrested, and he knew exactly about everything unusual that occurred.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Only a handful of police officers knew that.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Y-You...&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">I&#x2019;ll tell you where the next bomb will go off.</span></i> <i><span style="">By the way, the next one isn&#x2019;t a seedless watermelon.</span></i></p><p><span style="">&quot;H-How...!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Kim Do-shik stared at the phone in his hand with surprise.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He was a veteran who had been with the police for 30 years.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He was familiar with dealing with people.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Track the one I am on the phone with! He is a key witness in this case!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes, I understand.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Then he casually brought the phone to his ear again.</span></p><p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">Ah right, the tracking will become strange so don&#x2019;t waste your manpower.</span></i> <i><span style="">Don&#x2019;t you have to worry about labour costs?</span></i></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;...Hup!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">It was like he installed a listening device here.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Kim Do-shik felt fear towards the other person on the phone.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He seemed to know everything.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Surely he hadn&#x2019;t planted a spy?&#xA0;</span><span style="">But Kim Do-shik trusted everyone here.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Besides, none of them had sent a message anywhere.</span></p><p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">The bomber asked for 15 billion.</span></i> <i><span style="">But I am not so greedy.</span></i> <i><span style="">150 million won per criminal.</span></i> <i><span style="">That is a reasonable price.</span></i> <i><span style="">How about it?</span></i> <i><span style="">Sign a contract with me.</span></i></p><p><span style="">Kim Do-shik&#x2019;s eyes flashed.</span></p><p><span style="">The other person was asking for money in return for catching criminals.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Moreover, the amount was only 1/3 of what it cost to move hundreds of SWAT teams.&#xA0;</span><span style="">However, he wondered if the person could really catch the Bomber.</span></p><p><i><span style="">-You feel doubtful.</span></i> <i><span style="">It is understandable.</span></i> <i><span style="">I would be the same.</span></i> <i><span style="">Then I will find the next bomb for you.</span></i> <i><span style="">Will you believe me then?</span></i></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Y-You... What the hell is your identity?</span></p><p><span style="">The voice replied.</span></p><p><i><span style="">-A criminal who catches other criminals.</span></i> <i><span style="">Then-</span></i><em><span style=""> I am</span><span style="">&#xA0;called the God of Crime.</span></em></p><p><span style="">Thus, the God of Crime revealed himself to the Korean police.</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p>
