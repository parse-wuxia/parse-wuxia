<p><span style="">Chapter 149 - Phantom&#x2019;s Counterattack #4</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p><p><span style="">A match against Phantom!</span></p><p><span style="">The first one to challenge Phantom was Yamaguchi Takeshi.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Although the opponent&#x2019;s abilities were fearsome, the number of chips played a huge role in Bluff Poker.</span></p><p><span style="">1 VS 143.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was such a huge difference that normally it wouldn&#x2019;t even be a game.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The basic bet of Bluff Poker started at 10 million won.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was like one person fighting against an army.</span></p><p><span style="">Yamaguchi watched the other bosses.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Li Zheng still hadn&#x2019;t escaped from the confusion of Phantom&#x2019;s entry.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Caterina bowed her head in silence.</span></p><p><span style="">The one who held the larger number of chips would surely kill the opponent.&#xA0;</span><span style="">This was a great opportunity for Yamaguchi.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The game would end once he snatched Phantom&#x2019;s single chip.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Of course, if he succeeded first then the others wouldn&#x2019;t even be qualified to challenge.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I will take the position of the vanguard.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk, who was wearing dealer&#x2019;s clothes, sat in a chair and smiled.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Um, the dealers aren&#x2019;t in good shape so shall we play Bluff Poker by pulling cards one by one from the pile?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Yamaguchi stroked his beard and said,</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Won&#x2019;t you be able to cheat?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Then we will pull out a card for each other.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Hmm...then okay. I don&#x2019;t like it but it can&#x2019;t be helped.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I also want to add one condition.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;What is it?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;As you know, I might have to fight two more people in the future. Let&#x2019;s not get caught up in things like betting and bluffing.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Maybe I&#x2019;ll end it on my turn... well, do whatever you want.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk raised a partition and made a space for only two people around the table.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;No one else can interfere in this game.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Yamaguchi nodded to signal that he was fine with it.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Thus, Yamaguchi and Phantom&#x2019;s Bluff Poker game began.</span></p><p><span style="">Yamaguchi had 143 chips worth 10 million won stacked in front of him.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Phantom only had one chip.</span></p><p><span style="">Yamaguchi asked,</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;If you don&apos;t do the basic bet then you can&#x2019;t die right? Is it really okay?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I will keep my promise. Don&#x2019;t worry.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Huhu...then it is my turn.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Yamaguchi mixed 20 cards and put them on the table.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Tae-hyuk shuffled them once more and placed it in the pile.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Everything was ready for the game.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I&#x2019;ll go first.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Pull it out very slowly.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;You seem to be uneasy.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;There are many card sharks with hands that are faster than the eyes these days.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk grinned as he pulled out a card and laid it in front of Yamaguchi.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Y</span><span style="">amaguchi stared intently but couldn&#x2019;t find any signs of a trick.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Then it is my turn.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">All the preparations were finished and it was time for the cards to be opened.</span></p><p><span style="">Yamaguchi looked at Phantom&#x2019;s hand.</span></p><p><span style="">A 6.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was a moderately high number, but the opponent also had a chance of defeat.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;But isn&#x2019;t wearing a mask too unfair? This is called Bluff Poker.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I&#x2019;ll take it off.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Phantom pulled the opera mask off his face.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Underneath the mask was Yamaguchi&#x2019;s face.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;......!&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">He knew Phantom had this ability, but it was more amazing seeing it in person.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Isn&#x2019;t it better to have the same conditions?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">However, it didn&#x2019;t need to be his face!&#xA0;</span><span style="">Yamaguchi barely managed to refrain from shouting.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Then let&#x2019;s place the bets. I can only play the basic bet so I will bet 10 million.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Yamaguchi pulled the card down from his forehead.</span></p><p><span style="">A 5.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was only one lower than Phantom.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;C-Cough. How lucky.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Then let&#x2019;s do it quickly.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The approach was the same.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Draw a card, place it in front of the opponent, place it on the forehead, then bet.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Phantom bet 20 million won.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The preparations ended in an instant.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The result was that Yamaguchi had a 2 and Phantom had a 3.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hrmm...!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The difference wasn&#x2019;t large, so Yamaguchi&#x2019;s face darkened.&#xA0;</span><span style="">But it was still okay.</span></p><p><span style="">No matter how ghostly he was, luck in gambling didn&#x2019;t last.&#xA0;</span><span style="">If Phantom lost once then it would be a fatal blow to him.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Then, let&#x2019;s go to the next round.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Do it.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Phantom continued to go all-in.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was like a swordsman approaching death.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was literally fighting for their lives.&#xA0;</span><span style="">If he didn&#x2019;t kill the opponent then he would die.</span></p><p><span style="">20 million to 40 million...&#xA0;</span><span style="">80 million to 160 million...</span></p><p><span style="">Phantom&#x2019;s chips continued to grow.&#xA0;</span><span style="">In the end, Yamaguchi exploded.</span></p><p><span style="">A 2 card was attached to Phantom&#x2019;s forehead.&#xA0;</span><span style="">If it was the same pattern as before then Yamaguchi would have a 1.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;T-This is ridiculous! How does this keep continuing... It doesn&#x2019;t make sense...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;It is a coincidence. I am just a little more lucky than you.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;K-Kuhuk!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">In the end,Yamaguchi had to give up his strategy of making Phantom go all-in.&#xA0;</span><span style="">No, if this continued then he would lose.&#xA0;</span><span style="">In that case, it was better to slowly adjust the betting.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk shamelessly said,</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Let&#x2019;s finish it all at once.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk pushed all his chips into the middle of the table.&#xA0;</span><span style="">If Yamaguchi didn&#x2019;t bet the same amount then he lose the round.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;This! First I will watch the situation. I give up this round. Anyway, the card on my head is a...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Of course it would be a 1, so Yamaguchi forfeited and threw the card on the table.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Then he opened his eyes and groaned.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;...H-Heok!&#x201D; What? This!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">There was a card with a 10 on it, like it was making fun of Yamaguchi.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Don&#x2019;t you know that if you die with a 10, you have to pay double the bet? My apologies, but this is just the basics.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Y-You did all-in on a 10? If I accepted...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;It would&#x2019;ve been your victory.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Yamaguchi had continued to score one below Phantom in several rounds.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Phantom continued to declare all-in and won.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Yamaguchi thought the result would be the same if he declared all-in this time.</span></p><p><span style="">But what was this?&#xA0;</span><span style="">A 10?</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;H-How the hell...? P-Phantom. Your luck...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Yamaguchi muttered with a dark expression.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Thus, Yamaguchi&#x2019;s fighting spirit disappeared.&#xA0;</span><span style="">All that was left was to take the remaining money.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Tae-hyuk looked at Yamaguchi with a satisfied expression and said,</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Now, let&apos;s continue with the next hand.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Aaaagh, ahhhhhh!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2026;&#x2026;&#x2026;.</span></p><p><span style="">Within 10 minutes, Tae-hyuk had 1.44 billion won worth of chips.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Now Phantom was the one who had the most chips here.</span></p><p><span style="">@</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk clicked his tongue as he saw Yamaguchi staring blankly up at the sky.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;In fact, you had a way to win.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">One person would intentionally lose 10 million won to Phantom.&#xA0;</span><span style="">And another person would do the same thing.&#xA0;</span><span style="">If all three people had 1.43 billion won, two people would now be reduced to 1.42 billion won.&#xA0;</span><span style="">As a result, Phantom would become the property of the remaining person.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;In the end, no one wanted to make the sacrifice. Thus, nobody could get their hands on Phantom.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;......&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The Red Mafia and Triads bosses still remained but the results wouldn&#x2019;t change.&#xA0;</span><span style="">They gave up their only chance of victory.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk was able to change the card he pulled from the pile into whatever he wanted thanks to Counterfeit.&#xA0;</span><span style="">As soon as he pulled a card, he naturally touched the next one.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Thus, he used Counterfeit to change two cards at the same time.</span></p><p><span style="">Card counting?&#xA0;</span><span style="">Controlling the dealer?&#xA0;</span><span style="">Threatening with a gun?</span></p><p><span style="">None of that could beat Phantom, who could freely decide the numbers.</span></p><p><span style="">Yamaguchi was completely soulless.&#xA0;</span><span style="">In the end, Mister Park, who was waiting in the hallway, had to come and help him.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Next up are the Triads.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Bah. I won&#x2019;t be as easy to beat.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Really?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">20 minutes was enough time to beat Li Zheng.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;...H-H-Heok!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;B-Boss!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Now, it is Caterina&#x2019;s turn.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;......&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Caterina bit her lip and asked,</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;D-Do you dislike me so much?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk stroked her hair and smiled,</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;No way, that is impossible. Anne is someone who needs to do something very important.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Huh?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Let&#x2019;s finish the game here. I have two things to offer Anne. Do you want to hear it?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Offer?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes. If you give up the game here, then Anne will be able to obtain two benefits. You will lose to Phantom, but you will be ahead in points against the other bosses. I think that is enough to show the qualities of a boss.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;That is nonsense! That isn&#x2019;t enough to get the recognition of the other bosses.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;And after you give up, I will be the winner of this mafia game. What if such a person helps you?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;......&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Of course, I will refuse the position of head of the Korean branch. However, I will help you become the boss. Of course, you will have to return the chips to me.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk didn&#x2019;t forget that his opponent still had 1.43 billion won worth of chips.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Y-You will really do that?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Caterina asked tearfully.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes. You have been added to my precious balance.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;P-Precious...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Caterina&#x2019;s face reddened.&#xA0;</span><span style="">But this wasn&#x2019;t the end.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Tae-hyuk brought his mouth close to Caterina&#x2019;s ears and whispered,</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Well, the happy story ends here. Do you accept the offer?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;...Of course, Phantom. Such conditions are welcome. I-I really appreciate you helping me.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">After finishing the story, Tae-hyuk went out and declared victory to the other bosses.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;The Red Mafia boss has given up the game. With this, I will announce the revenue of each team. I have 2.87 billion won. The Red Mafia has 1.43 billion won. Then the remaining two teams...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Yamaguchi raised his body and said,</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Stop. It is our defeat. But why did you call us here if it was to end this way? You could&#x2019;ve just met Girlie alone.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk replied with a smile.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Ah, that? I will explain that now.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">He pressed a button and a monitor descended from the ceiling.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;It seems like you want to show us something.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Correct. Most of the cameras were used to hide the sleeping gas but there was a real one mixed in. This was taken.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;C-Cough.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Yamaguchi coughed and looked at the monitor.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Then something strange appeared.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Phantom was putting something in Yamaguchi&apos;s chest.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;&#x2026;!!!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;W-what is going on?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Caterina shrieked as she saw the surgical scene without any mosaics.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Kyaaack!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk patted her head and said,</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Don&#x2019;t worry. I didn&#x2019;t leave any scars.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;W-What did you do to my body?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Illegal Surgery. I did the same to the other people so Grandfather, don&#x2019;t be too sick.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Li Zheng and Caterina&#x2019;s faces turned pale.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Now, the next scene.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk flicked his fingers and Li Zheng and Caterina appeared in turn.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Caterina&#x2019;s white breasts were exposed but she couldn&#x2019;t afford to feel ashamed.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;W-What? What did you put in?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Bomb.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;B-Bomb?!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;...Bomb? P-Please give a proper explanation!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Li Zheng and Caterina tried to reach Phantom.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;The video isn&#x2019;t over yet. Then I will let you know the power of the bomb.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Once again, the screen changed.&#xA0;</span><span style="">This time, the same thing that was placed in the chest of the bosses was installed in the front seat of a car.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Tae-hyuk pressed a switch and the car exploded.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Whoa. It is hot just looking at it.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I-In my chest...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;If you try to get it out with surgery then it will explode, so be careful.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;H-How the hell did you put it in?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Very precisely. Oh, I also put it in the bodies of your lieutenants so you can share your sorrow.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;......&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk slowly walked to the centre of the casino.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was the place where the huge monitor was installed.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Then he spoke like he was a noble.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Here we have the detonation switch. If I press it, then the boss and lieutenants will die at the same time.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;This isn&#x2019;t helping!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I would rather die than become your subordinate! Anyway, there are numerous candidates in the Triads. Any one of them can replace me...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk shook his head at Li Zheng&#x2019;s violent reaction.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;You guys are just the messengers. What am I going to do with these detonators?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">They were shaped like a small fountain pen.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Tae-hyuk gave out three of them to the bosses.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;From now on, you are holding the lives of the different bosses and their lieutenants in your hand. Can you fight against each other then?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Yamaguchi looked at the detonator in his palm and muttered,</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;T-The bombs will explode if I press this?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes. Be careful. There will be a real bang!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Li Zheng&#x2019;s face paled even further.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Yamaguchi and Caterina could kill him anytime they liked.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Then this is the last game. Who will be the first to push the detonator? Of course, the deadline is...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;W-Who would do anything so dangerous...?!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk spread his arms open and declared,</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Forever!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The bosses were confused.&#xA0;</span><span style="">They couldn&#x2019;t press it because they didn&#x2019;t know whose detonator they had.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Still, they were aware that their lives were in their opponents&#x2019; hands.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Thus, the mafia will need to get along during this game.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;......!&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Caterina quickly noticed Phantom&#x2019;s purpose.</span></p><p><span style="">He wanted the Red Mafia, Triads and Yakuza to keep each other in check.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Therefore, the bosses wouldn&#x2019;t be able to fight a war against each other in South Korea.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Of course, peace wouldn&#x2019;t be sustained forever.&#xA0;</span><span style="">But as long as the people here existed as bosses, they couldn&#x2019;t move carelessly, making it like there was a truce.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;...It took only one night to shackle the mafia&#x2019;s necks.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Caterina touched her chest which contained the bomb installed by Phantom.</span></p><p><span style="">Her heart beat quickly.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Even though she was treated like this, her love didn&#x2019;t diminish.</span></p><p><span style="">@</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ohu... Kuhuhuhu... Uhahahaha!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk laughed crazily as the people left and he was alone.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Tae-hyuk installed bombs in the hearts of the participants of the mafia game and then returned the switches to their original owners.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;But they can&#x2019;t press it unless they know who it belongs to! They might die themselves!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">If a boss touched the switch to kill another boss, the bomb in their chest would explode.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Who would be the first one to blow themselves up?</span></p><p><span style="">The one certain thing was that the Red Mafia, the Triads and the Yakuza wouldn&#x2019;t be able to fight each other or touch Korea for now.&#xA0;</span><span style="">With this, the cats were collared.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;The mafia game ends with my victory! They can&#x2019;t touch South Korea anymore. The police are already not my opponents! Now, come. I showed the quality of a king. Hahaha! Yes, from now on I am...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk took the phantom mask from his pocket and placed it on his face.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The excitement heated up his head.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Finally, Tae-hyuk shouted something.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;....A king!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">[You have won the mafia game.]</span></p><p><span style="">[Do you want to upgrade to a King status?]</span></p><p><span style="">- Y/N</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p>
