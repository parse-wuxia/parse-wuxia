<p><span style="">Chapter 23 - Criminals #5</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p><p><span style="">&quot;Tae-hyuk!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Ah, Hyung!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Cho Kang-suk welcomed Tae-hyuk who had arrived at the police station.</span></p><p><span style="">Kang-suk pulled out a cup of cocoa from the vending machine and handed it to Tae-hyuk. He then poured milk in his coffee and drank it.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Well. I see that you arrested Kim Sang-hyun yesterday?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Yes. Do you know him?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk thought about what to say to Kang-suk. In the end, he explained everything except for the blacklist and crime skills.</span></p><p><span style="">Kang-suk glared once he heard that a thief had robbed their home.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Is Ha-ran ssi okay?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes. She is safe.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;That, if something like that happens next time, then you should call Hyung straight away!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Kang-suk clouted Tae-hyuk with his knuckles.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Fortunately, Robbery had failed.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ouch... I&#x2019;m sorry.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Kang-suk was sincerely worried about Tae-hyuk and Ha-ran.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk knew that Kang-suk was currently meeting with Ha-ran every weekend.&#xA0;</span><span style="">They went out to eat and watch movies.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It seemed like Ha-ran didn&#x2019;t hate Kang-suk.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Despite the age difference, weren&#x2019;t they a surprisingly good match?</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk decided to cheer on the two people.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;At any rate, are you sure you want to meet Kim Sang-hyun?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;It&#x2019;s okay, as there are a few things that I want to ask him.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Really?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">In the end, as a condition, Kang-suk accompanied Tae-hyuk to the interrogation room in order to meet Kim Sang-hyun.</span></p><p><span style="">Kim Sang-hyun was handcuffed and screaming loudly.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I mean, it was an accident! Why would I even go to the chief of police&#x2019;s house?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk sat on the other side of the table.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Hello. Kim Sang-hyun?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Kim Sang-hyun stared at Tae-hyuk who suddenly appeared and said,</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Who is this bastard?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk laughed.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;It is nice to meet you. I have one thing that I want to ask.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What the? Are you giving kids a tour now? Has the police department gone soft?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Kang-suk, who was standing at the door with crossed arms, approached.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Sang-hyun. This friend is like my younger brother. Talk to him. Also, before answering, think about how much soybean paste was in the soybean paste stew that you had yesterday.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Kim Sang-hyun turned pale at Kang-suk&#x2019;s words.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hiik! D-Detective Cho Kang-suk! I understand!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;You&#x2019;ll have it for more than a week if I like what I hear.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Three, no four days! I&#x2019;m sick of jajangmyeon!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Most of the interrogated suspects were provided with jajangmyeon from a nearby Chinese restaurant.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Kim Sang-hyun had already eaten it for all three of his meals.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The detectives didn&#x2019;t even bother to give him jjampong.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Brat. That&#x2019;s how delicious it is.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Thus, Tae-hyuk&#x2019;s interrogation began.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Two days ago, did you steal an item called Rosario from a house in H-dong? Let me know where it is currently at.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Kim Sang-hyun whistled.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;There was such a thing... Do I remember?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;You obviously stole it.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I don&#x2019;t know!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">In the end, Kang-suk had to come over again.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Sang-hyun. Do you want to eat pickled radish starting from today?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hiik!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">In the end, Kim Sang-hyun confessed everything he knew.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;That, I handed it over to Mama! It was completely cheap! I haven&#x2019;t even received the remainder of the money yet. Ah, damn. Surely, I didn&#x2019;t get caught because of that?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Hey. Who is Mama? Your mother?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Kim Sang-hyun flinched and replied.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I-I can&#x2019;t answer that, even if you ask! This is my life!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;You bastard. I am Cho Kang-suk. Do you want to keep a secret from Hyung? Say it quickly.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Cho Kang-suk and Kim Sang-hyun started to fight.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk laughed after hearing of Rosario&#x2019;s whereabouts.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Hyung. I think I know where it is. The interrogation can stop.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I-Is that so? Is this really okay?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Yes.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk left the interrogation room.</span></p><p><span style="">He leaned against the wall of the corridor and muttered.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;... That sly snake!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Big Mama had Rosario.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk couldn&#x2019;t even laugh at the sheer absurdity of the current situation. </span></p><p><span style="">He was like Son Wukong playing into the hands of Buddha.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;... I asked for info on the thief who stole Rosario, so she technically didn&#x2019;t lie to me. Hah. What should I do now?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">He thought about leaving it alone.</span></p><p><span style="">However, Tae-hyuk wasn&#x2019;t the type to avoid a fight.</span></p><p><span style="">He came up with a very good idea to get revenge on Big Mama.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ohuhu... you took Rosario, and in return, I will take away your most precious thing.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk smiled slyly. </span></p><p></p><p style="text-align: center"><span style="">* &#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;* &#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;*</span></p><p></p><p><span style="">Big Mama welcomed him as he entered the pawn shop.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Welcome. Omo, is it Seo Tae-hyuk? Did you come to leave something with me?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Big Mama was still wearing black mourning clothes. Her long hair was neatly tied back.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was a style that exposed her white neck.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;That good looking smile is a trap. A nine-tailed fox!&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk looked around Big Mama&#x2019;s store.</span></p><p><span style="">It was seemed like a common pawn shop; but in reality, it was a stomping ground for thieves.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk had gone home to get his blacklist before coming here.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He read the words he wrote down about Big Mama.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Is she still not big?&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">He knew what she was interested in. He knew her purpose for staying here as a stolen goods broker, and stored those things in his head.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Based on that information, he would be able to get what he wanted.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk licked his lips.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Nope. Actually, Mama is so pretty. Do you have time to go for a cup of coffee with me?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Omo! This child. Don&#x2019;t play around with Mama!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Big Mama covered her mouth with a hand and laughed.</span></p><p><span style="">Then, the smile disappeared from her face.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;However, Seo Tae-hyuk. Didn&#x2019;t you ask about Sang-hyun? Yesterday, he was caught trying to rob the police chief&#x2019;s house.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I see.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;You truly had no idea?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Big Mama stared into Tae-hyuk&#x2019;s eyes. </span></p><p><span style="">Her eyes were eerily piercing, like she was reading his mind.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Not at all.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I see. Then, sit down on the chair over there. I will prepare a cup of tea.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk felt sweat flowing down his back.&#xA0;</span><span style="">They had only exchanged a few words, yet Big Mama had already discerned that Kim Sang-hyun was caught by Tae-hyuk.</span></p><p><span style="">After a few moments.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Big Mama made a cup of green tea.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It wasn&#x2019;t from a teabag, but was freshly brewed.</span></p><p><span style="">Big Mama said with a smile.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;The information you told me was a lie. Moreover, you even thought about coming back here. You have more guts than I thought.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Mama isn&#x2019;t much different, right?&#x201D;</span></p><p>&quot;I&apos;m not a liar like Tae-hyuk.&quot;</p><p><span style="">The two people laughed, but the atmosphere was heavy with blood.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I didn&#x2019;t lie.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ahaha!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk took a sip of the tea and said.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hrmm. Mama, what do you think about art?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Big Mama made a sound at the unexpected question.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Hoh~ why are you asking such a thing?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;In fact, I&apos;m very interested in art. The artworks hanging in your store are quite famous.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Big Mama&#x2019;s eyes shone.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I didn&#x2019;t expect that Tae-hyuk would be interested in art.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;However, aren&#x2019;t they all forgeries?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;No, they are genuine.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk swallowed his saliva. This was the most important moment.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;That&apos;s right. If you think of artwork as genuine, then they are genuine. If you believe that they are fake, then they are fake.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hoh...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Big Mama made an amazed sound.&#xA0;</span><span style="">She never thought there would be someone who thought like her.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk was delighted.</span></p><p><span style="">&apos;It is natural. This is the motto of the Big Mama family.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">Big Mama looked at Tae-hyuk without saying anything.</span></p><p><span style="">&apos;She is searching for my reason for coming here. I shouldn&#x2019;t give it to her straight away, however.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk leisurely drank the green tea that Big Mama made him.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The expensive tea leaves created a completely different scent.</span></p><p><span style="">A long time passed.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk spoke in a tone that was neither too fast nor too slow.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Big Mama, yesterday was the &#x2018;Cyan Girl&#x2019; right?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Omomo! How did you know?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The Cyan Girl was one of the hidden oil paintings by the baroque master Saint Germain.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was unknown to the public, but was traded among collectors for a fairly high price.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk didn&#x2019;t answer Mama&#x2019;s question. He just continued his story.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I really think that it is a tragedy for one person to monopolize such a wonderful piece of work. Mama, don&#x2019;t you think so?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;......&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk pulled out a picture and handed it to Big Mama.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was an image of the Trail of the Sunset that she had been looking for.</span></p><p><span style="">The mask disappeared from Big Mama&#x2019;s face as her hidden feelings were revealed.</span></p><p><span style="">She was shocked.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Beautiful. Someone with a terminal illness saw this painting, and their mind could rest at ease, despite the fact that their illness wouldn&#x2019;t get better. They looked at this painting until their last moments. At least, that is just what I heard. This painting was then stolen by a thief, and became a legendary masterpiece in the end. Obviously, any collector would monopolize it. So, I had a thought. Let&#x2019;s paint this and distribute it to the people of this world.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Big Mama was at a loss for words. </span></p><p><span style="">It was the same. </span><span style="">The little boy in front of her was saying the same thing.&#xA0;</span><span style="">How was this possible?&#xA0;</span><span style="">She never told anyone her dream.&#xA0;</span><span style="">A coincidence? </span><span style="">Or destiny?&#xA0;</span><span style="">What word could explain this phenomenon?</span></p><p><span style="">Big Mama liked art, but such art was mostly dominated by a handful of rich collectors.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Thus, she entered the world of counterfeit art. She was living in an alley right now, but one day, she wanted to spread her ideals around the world.</span></p><p><span style="">However, how did this boy come to know all her thoughts?&#xA0;</span><span style="">Furthermore, the Trail of the Sunset that her dead husband liked was the first thing she wanted to copy and distribute.</span></p><p><span style="">It felt as if all her clothes had been stripped off for the public to see.&#xA0;</span><span style="">She was ashamed.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was the first time she felt like this.</span></p><p><span style="">Big Mama asked in a trembling voice.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;That, can you tell me where you took the photo? Obviously, you want to make a deal.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;But we lied to each other.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;......&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;So once again, I would like to offer a deal.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;W-what...?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Please accept me as a disciple.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Big Mama&#x2019;s eyes shook.</span></p><p><span style="">She was troubled.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk had the Trail of the Sunset that she wanted.&#xA0;</span><span style="">On the contrary, Tae-hyuk wanted her to teach him.</span></p><p><span style="">If she accepted this deal, then there would be a struggle to steal each other&#x2019;s possessions.</span></p><p><span style="">Many questions surfaced and disappeared in a period of less than 10 seconds.&#xA0;</span><span style="">In the end, she reached an answer.</span></p><p><span style="">Big Mama laughed and said.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Then you should start with cleaning.&#x201D;</span></p><p></p><p style="text-align: center"><span style="">* &#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;* &#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;*</span></p><p></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk confirmed the message on the Demon Revealing Mirror.</span></p><p><span style="">[Crime Skill: Forgery Knowledge has been learnt.]</span></p><p><span style="">-You can create one item after analysis completion.</span></p><p><span style="">-The quality of the finished object depends on your dexterity stat.</span></p><p><span style="">-Due to low proficiency, the quality of the goods made is poor.</span></p><p><span style="">-It has been registered in the temporary skills window.</span></p><p><span style="">&apos;It is like I thought!&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">He became Big Mama&#x2019;s disciple and had learned a new crime skill.</span></p><p><span style="">In order to perfectly master it, he needed to use the new skill to deal Big Mama a big blow.</span></p><p><span style="">But was this really the only way to learn a crime skill?&#xA0;</span><span style="">What if he learned how to make art for Big Mama here?</span></p><p><span style="">Experimenting would give him more information on the crime skills.</span></p><p><span style="">This skill was affected by dexterity, meaning that dexterity would increase as he practiced the skill.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Just like how he learned to study from An Eun-young, he would learn forgery from Big Mama.</span></p><p><span style="">Naturally, he needed to improve his dexterity to upgrade to a &#x2018;Noble&#x2019; status.&#xA0;</span><span style="">And after he perfectly mastered the skill...</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;I will take everything away from Big Mama.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">Big Mama had Tae-hyuk&#x2019;s Rosario.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He would take everything away from her. Naturally, that included regaining Rosario.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk stared at Big Mama&#x2019;s back with sly, upturned eyes.</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p>
