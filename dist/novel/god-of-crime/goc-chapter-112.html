<p><span style="">Chapter 112 - Jail War #4</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p><p><span style="">Kim Tae-sung looked at Tae-hyuk for a moment before sprinkling soy sauce over his porridge.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He stirred a few times before slowly eating.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Isn&#x2019;t this the first time we&#x2019;ve met? But why? I strangely feel like I&#x2019;ve met you somewhere.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk was the one who put him in here.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Of course, Tae-hyuk had no intention of telling that to the Bomber.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;This world is very small. Perhaps we met in passing somewhere?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Um... Indeed.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk scratched his chin.</span></p><p><span style="">TV was also available in prison.&#xA0;</span><span style="">However, it didn&#x2019;t mean that they could see the latest entertainment programs.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Only one &#x2018;Enlightenment&#x2019; channel was broadcasted.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Most of them were documentaries and cultural programs selected by the Department of Justice&#x2019;s correctional program.&#xA0;</span><span style="">They could also only watch it for a certain period of time before going to bed.</span></p><p><span style="">In the end, the only news from the outside world were sometimes edited news on the Enlightenment channel.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The man who bombed Taesung Group for revenge didn&#x2019;t know the ending of his story.&#xA0;</span><span style="">This was what Tae-hyuk was aiming for.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;You are a really interesting person. You are the only one crazy enough to do such a ridiculous thing to get revenge on a big company.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Kim Tae-sung&#x2019;s mouth twitched.&#xA0;</span><span style="">An emotion appeared for the first time on the middle-aged man&#x2019;s face.&#xA0;</span><span style="">However, Kim Tae-sung wasn&#x2019;t the type to come alive over such a thing.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;...I am finished eating. I will get up first.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I just arrived in this place, so I know some information about the outside world. You will become motivated if you listen to me.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Kim Tae-sung, who was about to rise from his seat, looked at Tae-hyuk with a cold expression.&#xA0;</span><span style="">What could possibly change his heart?&#xA0;</span><span style="">He put the tray back on the table and pulled canned peaches out of his pocket.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I ate rice and now I feel like eating fruit. Would you like one?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I will eat it thankfully.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Kim Tae-sung placed the peach on Tae-hyuk&#x2019;s plate with no expression.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Tae-hyuk cut it in half with a spoon and said,</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Taesung Group was developing a new virus. You would be more familiar with this fact than anyone else.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;......&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">A variety of expressions crossed Kim Tae-sung&#x2019;s face.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;You didn&#x2019;t mean to expose it in the first place. You had to give up everything you built as a senior researcher. However, the finished virus was more of a monster than you thought.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk spoke the truth about the Taesung case.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Then you went through a change of heart. You risked your life to expose the truth of what Taesung Group did to the media. I&apos;m sorry but I don&#x2019;t know what happened in the process; I just know the results.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The Taesung Group realized Kim Tae-sung&#x2019;s betrayal and tried to stop him by taking his family as hostages.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;But there was an unexpected event in Taesung Group. The virus used to hold them hostage had mutated. In the end, the prepared vaccine didn&#x2019;t work and your family died.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Kim Tae-sung&#x2019;s hands shook.&#xA0;</span><span style="">No matter how many years passed, the anger still remained in his heart.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes. Correct. Thus, the Bomber was born, and I killed innocent people to get revenge for my family. In the end, this happened. I don&#x2019;t know why anyone would be interested in the story where everyone was wounded and destroyed.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Bomber. You&apos;re mistaken.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Huh?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;It is still too early in the story. You thought you succeeded in your revenge but then you went to jail...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk stopped for a moment and looked into Kim Tae-sung&#x2019;s eyes.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Then the look disappeared as he started speaking again,</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;I know what happened to the Taesung Group after that.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Kim Tae-sung nodded.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;If you know then I would like to hear it.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">For the first time, longing appeared in his voice.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Tae-hyuk said with a satisfied expression,</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;This is the world. It is never fair. You sinned and got stuck in here. However, not all criminals go to jail.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;...It can&#x2019;t be.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes. The data that you risked your life to get, disappeared due to the carelessness of a manager.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;T-That...&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Kim Tae-sung had created a bomb to smash Taesung Group.&#xA0;</span><span style="">However, that wasn&#x2019;t enough to make a Korean conglomerate crumble.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;And Taesung Group&#x2019;s president, Song Won-jin was released a little while ago. A senior researcher committed suicide, leaving a suicide note stating that he did everything on his own. In the end, the arrested Taesung Group officials only had to pay a fine. How much would that amount be?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;......&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;200 million. That is the value of the lives of your family and the researchers.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;Ahhhhh!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Kim Tae-sung suddenly screamed, causing the prisoners nearby to jump.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Why is he doing that?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;People become crazy after staying here a while. Leave it alone.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk whispered to Kim Tae-sung.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Then what should you do? You can&#x2019;t get out of here until you die. The executives of Taesung Group have already returned to the company like nothing happened, and the mass media didn&#x2019;t report it so the interest of the public gradually disappeared. They just dimly remember that there was a crazy bomber. Is it okay to end it like this?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;I, what...?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Your revenge failed because you thought this world was just. You thought the opponent would be judged before you exposed their sins? But this is South Korea.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Kuhuuuok...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Don&#x2019;t you want to take revenge for their actions? This time, don&#x2019;t rely on the media and police and judge them directly.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Kim Tae-sung bit his lip.&#xA0;</span><span style="">If he could, he would&#x2019;ve laughed and died on the spot rather than going to prison.&#xA0;</span><span style="">However, Kim Tae-sung wasn&#x2019;t stupid enough to just believe the other person.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Is it possible?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes. To make a deal, I will show my hand first. I will tell you more tonight.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Huh? We are in the cells at night...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;So then wait for me there.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk bit the other half of the peach.&#xA0;</span><span style="">His tongue enjoyed the sweet taste of the sugar.</span></p><p><span style="">That night, Kim Tae-sung opened his mouth and looked at the other person.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Kim Cheol-su entered the cell dressed in the clothes of a guard.</span></p><p><span style="">@</span></p><p><span style="">&apos;This is a long-term use.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">Kim Tae-sung promised to cooperate with Tae-hyuk in return for breaking him out and help in getting revenge on Taesung Group.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;He can make a big bomb that blows up buildings.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">The four bombs he left behind had been very useful in the past few months.&#xA0;</span><span style="">But could he supplement it?&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was enough with the crime skills.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk looked at the note given to him by Kim Tae-sung.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It contained the ingredients needed to make a bomb.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Kim Tae-sung promised that he could create a significant explosion in the prison with these things.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk was aware of his skills more than anyone else.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;It will be busy tonight.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk checked on Yoo Cheol-ho&#x2019;s state, who was completely asleep, and entered the tunnel.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He didn&#x2019;t forget to take the keys hidden by the entrance.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He had snatched it away from a new guard a few days ago.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The guard would be suffering after knowing he lost it.</span></p><p><span style="">After leaving the cell, Tae-hyuk grasped the position of the guards with Spying.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He had a lot to do tonight. First, he had to collect the bomb materials and then steal the faces of the remaining guards for a full-scale war.</span></p><p><span style="">Up to now, Tae-hyuk could imitate the faces of five guards.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was impossible to completely disguise as them.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The guards walked around when they weren&#x2019;t working, so something could go wrong if he accidentally ran into them.</span></p><p><span style="">A greater variation of disguises was needed to ensure his safety.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He would double the number tonight.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk changed his clothing with Counterfeit and disappeared into the darkness.</span></p><p><span style="">@</span></p><p><span style="">Four days have passed since the meals had first changed.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The complaints of the prisoners became severe enough to pop.</span></p><p><span style="">It was currently the fun exercise time.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Exercise time was for only 60 minutes a day, and was a very precious time for the prisoners.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was the only chance for them to experience the cool air and move their bodies freely.</span></p><p><span style="">As usual, people with similar minds gathered together to play badminton or basketball.&#xA0;</span><span style="">However, they hadn&#x2019;t been able to eat a proper meal for days.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The only inmates jumping around were the foreigners.</span></p><p><span style="">The South Korean inmates huddled in a corner and swore at the guards.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Does this make sense? We are the only ones being starved.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;That guard over there is about to throw his food away. Can&#x2019;t he sprinkle some leftovers on my rice?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Wow, those evil bastards. Isn&#x2019;t this too much?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I was sniffing around the kitchen and discovered a guard eating. Fuck... I thought all the corn was gone.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;I will get those bastards fired as soon as I am out of here.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;When are you going to finish? Take me as well. I just extended...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The bloody conversation was over.</span></p><p><span style="">Normally, the anger towards the guards would&#x2019;ve already subsided.&#xA0;</span><span style="">But since yesterday, the behaviour of the guards became especially bad.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The warden had issued an order a few days ago not to agitate the nerves of the prisoners, yet some crazy guards still continued their tyranny.</span></p><p><span style="">Shin Chang-ho looked at the agitated prisoners with serious eyes from a corner of the playground.&#xA0;</span><span style="">His bodyguard said,</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hyung-nim. Cheol-su was right. The guards are acting ridiculous and the complaints of the prisoners are skyrocketing.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Shin Chang-ho muttered with a groan.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It felt more like a war with the prison guards instead of the Japanese.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;There really might be a war, but it still lacks the fire. Three days... We just need to wait three days.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The guards were armed with stun guns and gas guns.&#xA0;</span><span style="">If Shin Chang-ho made a mistake here, then he would be punished with solitary confinement.&#xA0;</span><span style="">But no matter how angry the prisoners were, they wouldn&#x2019;t explode without a trigger.</span></p><p><span style="">Please keep quiet...</span></p><p><span style="">Shin Chang-ho closed his eyes and begged.&#xA0;</span><span style="">However, the fires of war broke out from a very small place.</span></p><p><span style="">@</span></p><p><span style="">It was time for dinner, and the menu was once again the same old porridge.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Now it was too exhausting to even complain.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Fuck, again? Then I should eat the one I was saving.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Prisoner 974 pulled out the sausage he had been hiding.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was the precious emergency food he got from the store.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He started to peel it in order to eat it.</span></p><p><span style="">But with perfect timing, one of the guards struck his arm.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The sausage fell and rolled on the ground.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Number 947&#x2019;s eyes widened.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;M-My sausage!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Fortunately, the skin area was touching the ground so he could still eat it if he cut a little bit off.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Ah, I&apos;m sorry. The precious sausage is gone.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The guard laughed and stepped on 974&#x2019;s hand that was stretching to pick up the sausage.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Kuaaack!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">974 screamed as his hand and sausage were stepped on at the same time.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ah, sorry... I wasn&#x2019;t expecting you to pick it up to eat. Well. I think you can still eat it if you clean it well. Haha!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">In the end, 974 couldn&#x2019;t endure it anymore and exploded.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Fucking bastard!&#x201D;</span></p><p><i><span style="">Bam!</span></i></p><p><span style="">He punched the guard who stepped on his fingers.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Then the watching guards ran over with their rods.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;You over there! What are you doing now? Put him in solitary!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Ah? Solitary? I don&#x2019;t care about that anymore! Just let me kill this bastard!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Number 974 slapped at one of the guard&#x2019;s rods.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It struck the face of the prisoner sitting next to him.&#xA0;</span><span style="">In the end, the inmates nearby joined in the fight.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Kill them!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Aaaaack!&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Fuuuuuckers!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Even the guards who ran over to stop them got involved in the struggle.&#xA0;</span><span style="">In the end, the war between prisoners and guards started with one sausage.</span></p><p><span style="">The guard who stepped on the sausage had a nosebleed.&#xA0;</span><span style="">However, he smiled and licked his lips.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The guard muttered in a small voice,</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;&#x2014;As planned.&quot;</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p>
