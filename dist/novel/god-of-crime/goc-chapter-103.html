<p><span style="">Chapter 103: Accomplice #4</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p><p><span style="">The darkness of the city could be seen as the Ferris Wheel turned slowly towards the sky.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Kang-suk and Phantom didn&#x2019;t talk for a minute after its departure.</span></p><p><span style="">The first one to open his mouth was Kang-suk.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I&apos;m sorry, but could you not have that face?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Phantom was still wearing Kang-suk&#x2019;s face.&#xA0;</span><span style="">If they talked like this, then it felt like he was talking into a mirror.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Don&#x2019;t you like looking at your face?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;It&apos;s not that, it is a little annoying.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">All humans felt an instinctive displeasure when seeing a person with the same face as them.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It felt like he was meeting a doppelganger.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Kang-suk didn&#x2019;t have much interest in psychology.&#xA0;</span><span style="">However, he felt goose bumps when he saw his face smiling in front of him.</span></p><p><span style="">The psychological term that expressed this...&#xA0;</span><span style="">He had to search it up later.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was hard to talk, let alone negotiate.</span></p><p><span style="">Phantom laughed.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was the first time Kang-suk realized that his face could smile like that.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Then I will do what you want.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes, that would be appreciated.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Phantom put on the mask and then took it off again.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Shin Se-ho&#x2019;s face appeared once again.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Detective Cho Kang-suk. Are you comfortable now?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I don&#x2019;t like his face but this is better. By the way, what do you originally look like?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I&apos;m sorry, but I sometimes have to hide my identity to infiltrate the enemy. I can&#x2019;t show you my face without a disguise.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">It wasn&#x2019;t simply the face.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Everything, from the tone of his voice, to his speaking method seemed to be Shin Se-ho.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Kang-suk wondered about the body, but Phantom was wearing a thick trench coat.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hrmm. Is that special makeup?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I&#x2019;ll just say that it is something similar. By the way, you sound gentler. Didn&#x2019;t you sound angry whenever I called you on the phone?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I think you are very selfish.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">A variety of expressions crossed Kang-suk&#x2019;s face.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The person in front of him was a dangerous criminal that couldn&#x2019;t be compared to a neighbourhood gang.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Even if cooperation was necessary for the investigation, that fact remained unchanged.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;You are so dynamic that I want to tease you all day.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Stop the nonsense and get to the main point.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Yes. Now we will talk about the case that is giving Detective-nim a headache.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;......&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I think I can help you. How about it?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Kang-suk stared at Phantom silently.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He wondered how much Phantom knew about Park Sung-yul, so he decided to try it.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;What are you helping me with?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Phantom&#x2019;s eyes went gentle.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The answer that he received was far beyond Kang-suk&#x2019;s expectations.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;You want someone to sneak into Blue Dragon Prison and look for information on Park Sung-yul. If some of the conditions are met then I can help you.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;...You know a lot. How can you give a clear answer when I haven&#x2019;t even asked the question yet?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Maybe somebody gave me information.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;An informant.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Of course, it was a lie.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Phantom completely hid the fact that he wire-tapped Kang-suk by creating a fictional person.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I don&#x2019;t think it&#x2019;s a bad deal for the police. Of course, after everything is done, I must be able to leave properly.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Phantom laughed,</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Of course.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Well, if I was kept in there then I might lead some of the other prisoners on a jailbreak. Let&apos;s see. If I team up with the Bomber to escape, then the journalists won&#x2019;t have to worry about working for a week.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Kang-suk&#x2019;s body trembled.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Just thinking about that threat was terrifying.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Then let me ask you one thing. You aren&#x2019;t a police officer... What do you get for helping me?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Sometimes he did something horrific for a good reason.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Kang-suk suddenly wondered why Phantom came out like this.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;It is indeed money. Let&apos;s see. There is no bounty on a hidden crime. I am looking for the guilt of a man trapped in prison. I am fine with receiving 30 million.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I see. But I think you can make money through easier methods.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I am an irregular worker. I am very envious of the office workers with a regular salary.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Haha... At any rate, I will be sure to contact you at the end of the case.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I&#x2019;m not worried.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Phantom and Kang-suk briefly talked about the prison.&#xA0;</span><span style="">In the meantime, the Ferris Wheel was about to complete one turn.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Then are we accomplices?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;We have gathered strengths to solve this case so it isn&#x2019;t wrong to say that.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Then it was nice to meet you, Detective Cho Kang-suk.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;You as well, Phantom.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Phantom extended a hand covered by a thick glove.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I&#x2019;m sorry but my right hand is a bit hurt right now, so please bear with my left hand. Ah right, I am working with Cho Kang-suk, not the police.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Kang-suk shook hands with Phantom without saying anything.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Thus, the alliance between Phantom and Detective Cho Kang-suk formed.</span></p><p><span style="">@</span></p><p><span style="">The alliance with Phantom was established but the police were quiet.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Kang-suk apparently thought that there was some type of deal between the police commissioner and Phantom.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;He said to hide as much as possible that Phantom is involved in this case?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Kang-suk was about to make contact with the prison warden, which was the last preparation stage.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;He said that he would use the pseudonym Kim Cheol-su.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">On the table was Phantom&#x2019;s fake ID made by the General Affairs Department.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Ironically, even a family registration was needed to go to prison.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He couldn&#x2019;t go in with the name Phantom, so he needed a fake identity.</span></p><p><span style="">Inside the envelope was a resident registration card, a passport, and a driver&#x2019;s license.&#xA0;</span><span style="">But the photo shot was literally art.</span></p><p><span style="">Kang-suk lost his appetite looking at it.</span></p><p><span style="">The person was in their mid-40s, and displayed a half-shaved head covered in oil.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Deep wrinkles were seen on the face.&#xA0;</span><span style="">In particular, the reddish eyes looked dangerous.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was almost like he was on a drug.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Even so, the beard was neatly shaved with a razor blade.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The atmosphere that he gave off would make any weak person crack.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It felt like the face of a crazy person was painted.</span></p><p><span style="">He was photographed with an old shirt and a blue jacket.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The quality was so good that Kang-suk could distribute many flyers right now.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;This is enough to seem like a criminal...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">This was the appearance of &#x2018;Kim Cheol-su&#x2019; that Phantom would use in the prison from now on.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Is he the person who will enter Blue Dragon Prison?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Joo Hyun-ho opened the door and entered.&#xA0;</span><span style="">This mission was strictly confidential, so he didn&#x2019;t tell Hyun-ho that Kim Cheol-su&#x2019;s identity was Phantom.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Uh, that&#x2019;s right.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Hyun-ho looked at the photo on the ID and muttered.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Wow, totally perfect. What type of person is he? He looks like he could kill 15 people while laughing. If you knew such a person then you should&#x2019;ve told me in advance. There was no need to waste time on Phantom.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I didn&apos;t realize that I knew such a person.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;He gets 30 million won as compensation, although he certainly deserves that much for entering Blue Dragon. Of course, one billion would be given if needed.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;We were lucky.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Kang-suk barely managed to keep his mouth shut.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Was this what a hat seller felt like when they discovered that the king&#x2019;s ears were strange?</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Be quiet. I have to call the warden.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Yes.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">He had sought cooperation from the warden beforehand.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Now, if Kim Cheol-su&#x2019;s details passed, a new prisoner would enter Blue Dragon.</span></p><p><span style="">Kang-suk called the number of the prison stored in his phone.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Then a gentle voice welcomed Kang-suk.</span></p><p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">Detective Cho Kang-suk, is the criminal prepared?</span></i></p><p><span style="">&quot;Yes, I will send you the relevant materials through fax right now.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">Let&#x2019;s see...</span></i> <i><span style="">Wah.</span></i> <i><span style="">Isn&#x2019;t this person really a criminal?</span></i></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;I&#x2019;m sorry but he is an investigator. I had to find someone who is unknown to as many criminals as possible.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">With that face, he will fit in perfectly.</span></i> <i><span style="">At any rate, I will pay attention to Kim Cheol-su.</span></i> <i><span style="">I am the only one who knows that he is an undercover investigator.</span></i></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I understand. The more people who know, the more likely discovery will be.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">So I will keep it a secret, even if he is treated a little harshly by the prison guards.</span></i> <i><span style="">You should know</span></i><span style="">. </span><i><span style="">The prisoners confined here usually aren&#x2019;t human.</span></i> <i><span style="">A little roughness is needed to deal with these people.</span></i> <i><span style="">It is the only condition of my cooperation.</span></i></p><p><span style="">&quot;Yes, then Kim Cheol-su will arrive in three days.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">I hope this turns out well, Detective Cho Kang-suk.</span></i></p><p><span style="">The phone call ended there.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The prison warden definitely seemed to be hiding something, but it was impossible to know unless he went directly there.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Kang-suk muttered so that Joo Hyun-ho, sitting next to him, couldn&#x2019;t hear anything.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;In the end, everyone involved in this operation is deceiving someone.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">He lost his appetite.</span></p><p><span style="">Everything was in order to dig out the tragedy caused by Park Sung-yul.&#xA0;</span><span style="">However, the case wouldn&#x2019;t end that simply.</span></p><p><span style="">Three days later, the stage was moved to the Blue Dragon Prison.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Now Kang-suk had to wait for Phantom to safely get the information from Park Sung-yul.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;In the end, Phantom is the only one who can tell the truth about this case. He is literally an accomplice.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Kang-suk closed his eyes and leaned back in his chair.</span></p><p><span style="">@</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;The warden seems to be hiding something; you should be careful.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Kang-suk and Phantom were riding the convoy heading to Blue Dragon Prison.</span></p><p><span style="">Once they arrived at the port, they would ride on the boat for 30 minutes before arriving at Blue Dragon Prison.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Rather than the handcuffed Phantom, Kang-suk was the one that seemed more nervous.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Don&apos;t worry. I am Kim Cheol-su. I don&#x2019;t care if it is Blue Dragon or Red Pheonix, no prison can hold me.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The tone was a completely different person to Phantom.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The more he watched, the stranger it was.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;The guards don&#x2019;t know that you are a co-worker. They just think you are a criminal who has committed terrible acts. It will be hard for you to endure.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Phantom laughed.</span></p><p><span style="">Endure?&#xA0;</span><span style="">He had lived there for 10 years.&#xA0;</span><span style="">If he closed his eyes, the appearance of Blue Dragon Prison still vividly popped up.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The time limit was one month.&#xA0;</span><span style="">At that time, he had an appointment with the warden to get him out of prison.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Detective Cho Kang-suk, we&#x2019;ve arrived.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Salty wind blew through the iron bars covering the window of the back door.&#xA0;</span><span style="">They were at the port where a ship would transport them to Blue Dragon Prison.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The moment he got there, he would be a prisoner completely disconnected from the world.</span></p><p><span style="">Phantom licked his lips and recalled the prison that was beyond the horizon.</span></p><p><span style="">First of all, it was important to find the gold left behind by the Japanese army.&#xA0;</span><span style="">However, it was surprisingly enjoyable to solve the puzzle made by Park Sung-yul.</span></p><p><span style="">&apos;Past events have already happened. How many puzzles can I solve based on the ending that I know?&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">Phantom smiled and looked at his accomplice.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Then let&apos;s go.&quot;</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p>
