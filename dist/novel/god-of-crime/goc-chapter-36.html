<p><span style="">Chapter 36 - Ill-Fated Relationship from a Past Life #7</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p><p><span style="">Park Jung-bae did better than Tae-hyuk initially thought.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk&#x2019;s purpose wasn&#x2019;t simply to win a large sum from gambling.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Even if he won now, the threat of a predator wouldn&#x2019;t disappear, as long as SY existed. </span><span style="">SY might strike again to take away something else that was precious.</span></p><p><span style=""> In the end, he had to win the war, and not just the battle.&#xA0;</span>To get rid of the predator, it was necessary to pull out its teeth and claws in order to weaken them. In the case of SY, their money represented those teeth and those claws.</p><p><span style=""> &#x2018;Destroy the illegal casino system itself.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style=""> According to Big Mama&#x2019;s information, most of SY&#x2019;s operating funds were supplied from this casino.&#xA0;</span>If it disappeared, then the organization would naturally die out in suit. It was the best way to get rid of the ghost from a previous life.</p><p><span style=""> In order to do that, Park Jung-bae&#x2019;s cooperation was essential.&#xA0;</span>Tae-hyuk had promised him 50% of the profits earned from today&#x2019;s events.</p><p><span style=""> Han Sang-won murmured in a trembling voice.</span></p><p><span style=""> &#x201C;W-What is going on...?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style=""> As if to answer his question, the door to the manager&#x2019;s room opened.&#xA0;</span>A person in a suit burst in and shouted in an urgent voice.</p><p><span style=""> &#x201C;S-S-Sang-won hyung-nim. I-It is serious!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;I told you to call me chief! Where is that bastard Park Jung-bae?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style=""> &#x201C;T-that...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;What about it?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;Hyung-nim should run away! The police are out there!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style=""> Han Sang-won&#x2019;s face distorted in an instant.</span></p><p><span style=""> &#x201C;Son of a bitch! How much have I paid him in the up to now...?!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style=""> Tae-hyuk started to take the money piled up on the table while Han Sang-won was distracted by the sudden appearance of the police.</span></p><p><span style=""> It was 300 million in total.&#xA0;</span>It was already lucky that he previously gained 50 million won. If not, he would have needed to mobilize 007 bags to move it.</p><p><span style=""> He started out with 30 million won, and it had literally multiplied by around 10 times its original amount.</span></p><p><span style=""> &#x2018;The professional gambler fled, and has probably been arrested by the police officers guarding the exit.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style=""> Kim Shin-hyeong could no longer be seen.&#xA0;</span>His wits were incredible, since he gambled for a living.</p><p><span style=""> &quot;Seo, Tae, Hyuk!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style=""> Han Sang-won glared at Tae-hyuk.</span></p><p><span style=""> Tae-hyuk replied with a sudden expression of remorse.</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;Ah, Chief. Doesn&#x2019;t Noona still owe you 250 million won?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style=""> Tae-hyuk extended the money to Han Sang-won.&#xA0;</span>Once the police came in, the money would be no different from toilet paper. He acted like this while knowing that fact.</p><p><span style=""> &#x201C;Kuock! T-This bastard!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style=""> Han Sang-won couldn&#x2019;t resist the urge and pulled out a knife.</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;Don&#x2019;t you have to run away? Kim Shin-hyeong has already escaped. Meanwhile, the police encirclement is narrowing.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style=""> The manager&#x2019;s room had a back door.&#xA0;</span>Tae-hyuk thought it would be best for Han Sang-won to run away there.</p><p><span style=""> Park Jung-bae, who was armed, would soon come here to receive the money that could be called the profits of this case.&#xA0;</span>Before that happened, it would be more than easy for Han Sang-won to disappear.</p><p><span style=""> However, more than three minutes had already passed by.</span></p><p><span style=""> &#x2018;This bad detective...! He is completely late!&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style=""> Thus, Tae-hyuk had to deal with Han Sang-won alone.</span></p><p><span style=""> &#x201C;Fuck. I&#x2019;ll kill you now, even if it means getting caught!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style=""> Tae-hyuk felt sweat flowing down his back.</span></p><p><span style=""> &apos;I-Isn&#x2019;t this a dangerous situation...?&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style=""> There were loud sounds coming from outside the door.&#xA0;</span>The guests who came to the casino had become mixed up in this mess.</p><p><span style=""> At that moment, something unexpected happened.</span></p><p><span style="">[Crime Skill: Violence has been learnt.]</span></p><p><span style=""> -Can use iron pipes.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk stared at the Demon Revealing Mirror with an absurd expression.</span></p><p><span style=""> &#x2018;It is good that I received a new skill. What? Can use iron pipes?&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style=""> That was the end of it.</span></p><p><span style=""> &#x2018;If I have the Violence skill, then shouldn&#x2019;t I be able to win in a 17:1 fight? But what is this?!&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style=""> Despite how he felt, Tae-hyuk tried to use the skill.&#xA0;</span>Then, as if it had always been there, an iron pipe appeared out of thin air. He caught it, since there were additional capabilities.</p><p><span style=""> &apos;The cold feeling in my hand. I can only wield it in moderation. This really is the end for me!&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style=""> Unlike his bad appearance, Tae-hyuk was a &#x2018;model student&#x2019; who had never been in a fight before.&#xA0;</span>Even if he had the iron pipe, he wouldn&#x2019;t be able to win in a fight against Han Sang-won, who was a gangster.</p><p><span style=""> &apos;Ah, I don&#x2019;t know! It is better than nothing!&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style=""> The agitated Han Sang-won rushed towards him and swung his knife towards Tae-hyuk&#x2019;s arm to try and cut a wrist artery.&#xA0;</span>Tae-hyuk aimed the iron pipe towards Han Sang-won&#x2019;s head.</p><p><i><span style="">Kang!</span></i></p><p><span style=""> There was a loud thud and the opponent&#x2019;s body shook.</span></p><p><span style=""> &apos;Uh, isn&#x2019;t this better than I thought?&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style=""> Tae-hyuk had never seen a fight between criminals.&#xA0;</span>All he could remember from the movies were the protagonists attacking the enemies.</p><p><span style=""> Even so, he was able to deal an intense blow to Han Sang-won&#x2019;s head.&#xA0;</span>The iron pipe, summoned by the Violence skill, moved as it if was part of his body.</p><p><span style="">[With the effect of your stamina, you can deal stronger blows.]</span></p><p>[Agility will allow you to move more swiftly.]</p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Wah, my stats are applied!&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style=""> Tae-hyuk was filled with admiration.&#xA0;</span>Violence was a simple skill that allowed him to summon an iron pipe. But when he held it in his hands, his stamina and agility stats were reflected within, and he could make stronger and more agile movements.</p><p><span style="">While Han Sang-won was the master of the back alley fights, Tae-hyuk was unlikely to lose this one.</span></p><p><span style=""> &#x201C;This bitch!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style=""> After being hit by the iron pipe, Han Sang-won ran aggressively towards Tae-hyuk.</span></p><p><span style=""> Tae-hyuk stepped forward and calmlyswung the pipe towards the hand holding the knife.</span></p><p><i><span style="">Bam!</span></i></p><p><span style=""> &quot;Kuaaaak!&quot;</span></p><p><span style=""> Han Sang-won screamed and dropped the knife he was holding.&#xA0;</span>Tae-hyuk confirmed it with the Demon Revealing Mirror. With the previous blow, he had completely learned the crime skill. It was the first time that he had received two skills from one incident.</p><p><span style=""> &quot;D, i, e! This bastard!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style=""> Han Sang-won roared and ran to the table in the corner of the manager&#x2019;s room.&#xA0;</span>He pulled out a pistol from the drawer, aiming it at Tae-hyuk.</p><p><span style=""> &#x2018;Crazy, this isn&#x2019;t America where guns are everywhere, you know?&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style=""> Tae-hyuk gave more strength to the hand holding the iron pipe.&#xA0;</span>How could he fight against an enemy with a gun, instead of a knife?</p><p><span style=""> At that moment, the reinforcement that he had been waiting for arrived.</span></p><p><span style=""> &#x201C;Chief Han. You keep acting poorly until the end. You lost.&#x201D;</span></p><p><i><span style="">Clink.</span></i></p><p><span style=""> Park Jung-bae entered the room, pulled out a gun and aimed it at Han Sang-won&#x2019;s head.</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;Detective, Park! This bastard dared betray me!&quot;</span></p><p><span style=""> &#x201C;This... Don&#x2019;t misunderstand me, as we weren&#x2019;t on the same side in the first place.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;Have you forgotten that there is somebody behind this organization?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style=""> Park Jung-bae laughed.</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;I know. That person is politician Park Seong-ho, who, for reference, was caught in a political scandal last month, and is now confined in a halfway house.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style=""> &#x201C;Kuock!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style=""> Han Sang-won grit his teeth. </span></p><p><span style=""> Park Jung-bae knew everything, so his bluff wouldn&#x2019;t work.&#xA0;</span>SY was an organization raised on the back of a politician, which was why the police weren&#x2019;t able to handle them properly. They pretended not to see the many criminal actions, but now it was different.</p><p><span style=""> &quot;It looks like you are saving money in order to make connections with other politicians. However, that is the wrong move. A few days ago, the name of SY emerged from Park Seong-ho&#x2019;s mouth. You are now a walking bomb.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style=""> &#x201C;......&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;There is no one who will carry that bomb. It is the end of SY.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style=""> Han Sang-won lost his spirit and sat down.</span></p><p><span style=""> Tae-hyuk, who had been watching the conversation between the two people, opened his mouth.</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;Detective Park, you are completely late.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style=""> Park Jung-bae spoke while handcuffing Han Sang-won.</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;I forgot to say the Miranda Rights because I was too busy talking. Chief Han, you heard it roughly.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style=""> &#x201C;......&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style=""> Saliva emerged from Han Sang-won&#x2019;s mouth.</span></p><p><span style=""> &#x201C;Things became a mess.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style=""> Park Jung-bae placed Han Sang-won in a corner and turned his attention to Tae-hyuk.&#xA0;</span>He came here alone because there was something he wanted.</p><p><span style=""> &quot;By the way, why was he pointing a gun at you? Even if he is a criminal, isn&#x2019;t that overkill?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;Does a corrupt cop care about that?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style=""> &#x201C;Ahaha...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;Then, let&#x2019;s split the revenue.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style=""> Tae-hyuk showed Park Jung-bae the vitamin drink boxes containing money.&#xA0;</span>There were four boxes with 50 million won each.</p><p><span style=""> &quot;Well, that is 200 million, and will be divided 5:5 per the contract. 100 million each.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style=""> Park Jung-bae received two vitamin boxes from Tae-hyuk. He checked the contents and made a satisfied expression.</span></p><p><span style=""> He had completely swept up the bad guys, and had also got some extra income doing so. It was a rewarding day.</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;It is surprising that Mama knows someone like you. I confess that I did some investigation, since it was a proposal from a kid.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style=""> &#x201C;So it is like that. Well, it doesn&#x2019;t matter.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style=""> &#x201C;You were the one who uncovered the crimes of Park Seong-ho&#x2019;s son. Additionally, on the same day, Park Seong-ho&#x2019;s wrongdoings were uncovered. &#xA0;Don&#x2019;t you think this is a strange coincidence?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style=""> Tae-hyuk laughed.</span></p><p><span style=""> Park Jung-bae was more competent than he initially thought. However, he wouldn&#x2019;t discover the truth of this case.</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;Well, maybe we had a relationship in a past life.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style=""> &#x201C;A relationship?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;Probably an ill-fated one.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style=""> &#x201C;Haha! An ill-fated relationship from a past life. Anyways, if you have another job similar to this one, then contact me again. I&#x2019;ll be waiting.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style=""> Then there was a signal from Park Jung-bae&#x2019;s walkie-talkie.</span></p><p><span style=""> -</span><i><span style="">Detective Park.</span></i> <i><span style="">The situation is ending.</span></i></p><p><span style=""> &#x201C;Yes. I am coming now.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style=""> Park Jung-bae pointed to the back door of the manager&#x2019;s room.</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;Go out that way. I&#x2019;ll instruct them to release the net for a moment.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style=""> &#x201C;Thank you. Then...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style=""> Corrupt policeman Park Jung-bae.</span></p><p><span style=""> Tae-hyuk left the casino, Park Jung-bae gazing after him.</span></p><p>@</p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk sighed with relief as he sat down on his bed.</span></p><p><span style=""> The long day had ended.</span></p><p><span style=""> &#x201C;Detective Park. I&#x2019;m sorry, but didn&#x2019;t you know about this?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style=""> Tae-hyuk took off his clothes, revealing the wads of cash taped underneath.&#xA0;</span>Today, he had earned a total of 100 million from SY Capital.</p><p><span style=""> &quot;It is too big of an investment to only regain half.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style=""> Ha-ran had 50 million stolen from her.&#xA0;</span>He spent almost 20 million on the information. In addition, 30 million out of the 300 million was originally his. No matter how he thought about it, earning 100 million was a deficit.</p><p><span style=""> &#x2018;It was the right answer to hid some money in advance.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style=""> In a situation where guns were pointed at each other, one mistake could cost a person their lives.&#xA0;</span>In the midst of all that, Tae-hyuk had been concealing the money.</p><p><span style=""> &quot;In the end, I received 200 million?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style=""> Tae-hyuk laughed.</span></p><p><span style=""> Not long ago, he had been working as a delivery man at a Chinese restaurant for 10,000 won. Now, he had just earned 200 million in one night.</span></p><p><span style=""> It felt strange. </span></p><p><span style=""> However, he had promised to take back 10 times the lost money.&#xA0;</span>It was a bit lacking.</p><p><span style=""> &quot;There are still gifts left. This time, please be satisfied.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style=""> Tae-hyuk whispered into Ha-ran&#x2019;s ears, who had fallen asleep waiting for him.</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p>
