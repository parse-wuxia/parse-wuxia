<p><span style="">Chapter 154 - End of the Revenge #1</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p><p><span style="">Wolsang was a research institute specializing in particle physics.</span></p><p><span style="">The task that they were focusing on now was a new energy development project that could potentially be several times more efficient than fossil fuels.&#xA0;</span><span style="">If it succeeded, all the researchers who participated would be able to win the Nobel Prize in physics.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;The looks in their eyes are ridiculous. Besides, isn&#x2019;t that a particle accelerator?&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">It was a device that boasted a huge price, but there was a lot of dust piled up on it.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It meant it hadn&#x2019;t been used for research in a while.</span></p><p><span style="">A researcher was sitting on a desk and seemed to be writing a report with an annoyed expression.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;It is typical of a research institute with no money.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">In any case, the situation of the Wolsang Institute didn&#x2019;t seem that great.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Certainly, this seems more difficult than robotics or developing a new material.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">There seemed to be a lot of empty chairs, indicating that the management of this institute wasn&#x2019;t so good.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Great achievements required a lot of money, but if there weren&#x2019;t any results, then they wouldn&#x2019;t get any investments.</span></p><p><span style="">It was literally a Mobius strip.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ah! Director Go Ah-tae! Hello, it is Ha-ran.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Ha-ran said with a smile and the man sitting in the corner lifted his head.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The ramyun noodles cups piled up on his desk indicated how long he had been here.</span></p><p><span style="">He had a beard from not shaving for a few days.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The skinny body also indicated the time spent here.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Was he around 40 years old?&#xA0;</span><span style="">He was fairly young for a director.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He also didn&#x2019;t have a separate office, working in the same space as the other researchers.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ha-ran? Ah, please wait a moment. I&#x2019;ll bring some drinks.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Go Ah-tae headed to the refreshments room with a friendly smile.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He swayed strangely like he was ill.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Haha! I ran out of coffee. Sorry but this...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Go Ah-tae brought out cups containing cold water.&#xA0;</span><span style="">There wasn&#x2019;t a trap so he held all three cups in his hands with an anxious expression.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Help yourselves.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Wah! I am thirsty. I&#x2019;ll drink it well.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Go Ah-tae had heard about Tae-hyuk through Ha-ran.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Are you Seo Tae-hyuk? I&apos;ve heard a lot about you from Ha-ran. Nice to meet you, I am Go Ah-tae, the director of this institute.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I am Seo Tae-hyuk.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk secretly used Spying to check his status window.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Stamina was almost zero, but his intelligence was enormous.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Furthermore, he had a profession other than the director of a research institute.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Isn&#x2019;t this quite surprising? Fortunately, there aren&#x2019;t any problems.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk analyzed the situation of the research institute.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The facility had received a good amount of investments, so the equipment was good.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was comparable to places like the European particle physics institutes.&#xA0;</span><span style="">But the companies that invested in these type of places were in a rush, so if no visible results were shown, then they would withdraw themselves from the project.</span></p><p><span style="">This situation was just like that.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The researchers moved to other places and this was what remained.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The director was somehow leading the project by himself, but it seemed like there was a limit.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was just before the sinking of the ship.</span></p><p><span style="">&apos;He had a reason to invest in Noona. It is a situation where he even needs to borrow the hands of university students.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">Still, it seemed like there would be a lot to learn from working under such an enthusiastic director.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was enough if Ha-ran was satisfied.&#xA0;</span><span style="">If it was money then he would soon be able to earn a big amount anyway.</span></p><p><span style="">&apos;Yes, help the Bomber get revenge and then go find the gold. Most of the Yakuza in Korea are returning to Japan so this is a great opportunity. And the remaining ones are probably...&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">As Tae-hyuk smiled, Go Ah-tae asked him.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I think that Tae-hyuk&#x2019;s mind is very good. Do you want to make something like a black hole?&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;...I&#x2019;m sorry but I have to go to university.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;T-That&#x2019;s right. If you change your mind then here is my contact number...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">After spending an hour talking, Go Ah-tae had another appointment.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He had to go to another research institute for assistance.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Even though he seemed quite busy, he still called them there to talk.</span></p><p><span style="">Director Go Ah-tae&#x2019;s expectations for Ha-ran seemed quite big.</span></p><p><span style="">@</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk turned to the Bomber sitting in the back seat of a stolen Mercedes and asked.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Can you artificially create a black hole?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;It is impossible with the current technology. Won&#x2019;t it be hard unless the Higgs Particle is discovered?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Indeed.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;But why are you asking about such a thing?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Ah, it is nothing. Just a personal matter.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The Bomber laughed and checked the bombs filling the back seat.&#xA0;</span><span style="">They were enough to blow up the entire Taesung Chemicals research institute.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;By the way, I didn&#x2019;t know that the perpetrator of the disease was Direct Jang Ik-sam.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Do you know him?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Not really. I just thought that he was a good person. Yet my family... K-Kuheok!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The Bomber bit his lip and suppressed his anger.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He formed tight fists and said,</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Please let me handle Director Jang Ik-sam with my own hands.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I was already planning on that.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk parked 500m away from the Taesung Institute of Physics and Chemistry.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Then he pulled out a large map.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Last night, he had gone to the destination and used Spying.&#xA0;</span><span style="">This was the result.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;This is a blueprint of Taesung Institute. The bombs will be installed in the places shown here. If they explode at the same time, then we can blow up the entire institute.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes, I understand. Then this place with the O mark is...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;The director&#x2019;s room is there. Do you understand what I mean?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Thank you for keeping your promise, Phantom.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The Bomber memorized the locations of the bombs.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Let me explain an outline of the operation. Currently, the Taesung Institute had a huge increase in the number of guards. I will go into the institute first and deal with them while you install the bombs in the specified points. After that is done, go to the room where Jang Ik-sam. Do you know what to do after that?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;...Of course.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;What weapon do you want?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The Bomber picked out a pistol from the weapons in the car.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Can you shoot it?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Haha. I also went to the army.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Well. This should be fine.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The Bomber confirmed that there were six bullets in the magazine and placed it in his pocket.&#xA0;</span><span style="">This would be enough to take care of Jang Ik-sam.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Tae-hyuk nodded and started walking silently in the darkness.</span></p><p><span style="">The Bomber followed quietly with a heavy bag.</span></p><p><span style="">&apos;This is truly the end of my previous life. The Psychotropic Incense is really important so Mister Park has kept it all in the institute and guarded by Yakuza members. I can change my fate if I take care of this.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">Mister Park was also in the laboratory.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Tae-hyuk had been falsely framed thanks to Mister Park.</span></p><p><span style="">Jang Ik-sam had killed the Bomber&#x2019;s family.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Whoops, I almost forgot. After this, should I go and buy a wedding gift for Noona?&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">Seo Ha-ran and Cho Kang-suk&#x2019;s wedding ceremony was taking place next week.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Tae-hyuk moved through the darkness as he thought about what to buy his sister.</span></p><p><span style="">And after a while...</span></p><p><span style="">The operation to break his ties with Mister Park began.</span></p><p><span style="">@</span></p><p><span style="">The Taesung Institute of Physics and Chemistry was in the research complex until a year ago.&#xA0;</span><span style="">After public opinion turned against them for the mass killing event, the location was moved to a secret place.</span></p><p><span style="">It was right here.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Tae-hyuk looked at the research institute in front of him.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It seemed like there was nothing inside.&#xA0;</span><span style="">However, that was just a camouflage to conceal the identity.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The Taesung Institute of Physics and Chemistry was hiding underground.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk placed his hand on the wall and triggered &#x2018;Spying&#x2019;.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Then he was able to see how many people were hiding in the building.&#xA0;</span><span style="">As if it had been waiting, the Demon Revealing Mirror assigned him a mission.</span></p><p><span style="">[Kill Mister Park and the Yakuza members.</span></p><p><span style="">The remaining number of Yakuza members: 117]</span></p><p><span style="">This was the first time it said to kill the opponents.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He wasn&#x2019;t planning to keep them alive anyway so he decided to follow the Demon Revealing Mirror&#x2019;s mission.&#xA0;</span><span style="">After receiving the mission, he could see the targets on the map.</span></p><p><span style="">In front of Tae-hyuk&#x2019;s eyes, the map of the research institute appeared like a hologram.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The red dots were shining brightly.&#xA0;</span><span style="">They were the Yakuza members guarding the institute.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;The Psychotropic Incense is really important. Aren&#x2019;t most of the Yakuza members remaining in South Korea?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Of course, there were other remnants left. However, most of the people who could fight were gathered here.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;It means that if I get rid of them, the ones who will interfere with my treasure hunt will also disappear. It is good luck.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk licked his lips.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It tasted oddly of blood.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Then let&#x2019;s go.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The Bomber tilted his head and asked,</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;But the surveillance cameras watching the walls...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Who said we were going over the wall? I am going in this way.&#x201D;</span></p><p><i><span style="">Kikikikik!</span></i></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk raised his robotic arms and cried out.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Machina, mode Smash!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Both Machina arms were pulled back to their limit.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Then they shot towards the wall in front of him.</span></p><p><i><span style="">Kuwaaaaaang!</span></i></p><p><span style="">Then the wall made of cement shattered with a huge roar.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The Bomber was speechless.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;......&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">An excavator was needed to break a wall of that thickness.&#xA0;</span><span style="">However, a human had punched it with the force of a machine.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He could imagine what would happen if that was used to attack humans.&#xA0;</span><span style="">They would literally become chunks of flesh.</span></p><p><span style="">But this wasn&#x2019;t the end.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Tae-hyuk was dressed in a modified version of the body armour worn by Big Brother from the Triads.&#xA0;</span><span style="">One or two bullets wouldn&#x2019;t give him any fatal injuries, and most aggressive actions were possible.</span></p><p><span style="">&apos;Furthermore, Machina can be used to protect my exposed head.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">He could see the trajectory of the bullets and had Bullet Time that accelerated his mind.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He was confident that he alone could win against an army.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk had two pistols hanging from his waist and a FA-MAS 62 rifle on his shoulder.&#xA0;</span><span style="">There were 20 magazines containing 12 bullets.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He had a bunch of pockets in his body armour, allowing him to hold them all.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He was significantly armed but this wasn&#x2019;t that much if he was to fight over 100 Yakuza.</span></p><p><span style="">If they all attacked at once, it would be difficult to avoid all the shots, even with Bullet Time.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Therefore, he chose an appropriate route.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk placed the skull mask on his face.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The Bomber was wearing a mask of the same design.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Then it is a showdown between two bombers and 117 Yakuza members. It would be a plausible action movie if this was filmed. Unfortunately, that will have to wait for the next opportunity.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Once Tae-hyuk gave the signal, the Bomber started running towards the place where the bombs would be installed.</span></p><p><span style="">The skull mask shone white in the darkness.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Then it is time to kill.&#x201D;</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p>
