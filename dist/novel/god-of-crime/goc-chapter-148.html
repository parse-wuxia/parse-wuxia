<p><span style="">Chapter 148 - Phantom&#x2019;s Counterattack #3</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p><p><span style="">Bluff Poker was basically a game consisting of 20 cards numbered from 1-10.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Once the dealer drew a card and placed it in front of the player, they would raise it to their forehead without checking it.&#xA0;</span><span style="">They would look at the opponent&#x2019;s card and make a bet.</span></p><p><span style="">Yet something strange was happening.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Caterina had the perfect poker face and freely used card counting.&#xA0;</span><span style="">She also had an eye for seeing through her opponent&#x2019;s bluff so she didn&#x2019;t need a lie detector.&#xA0;</span><span style="">However, she couldn&#x2019;t win even once.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Huu, huuuu...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Caterina groaned tearfully.</span></p><p><span style="">It was the same with Yamaguchi.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Haha.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Due to Mister Park&#x2019;s schemes, the dealers here were loyal servants of the Yakuza.&#xA0;</span><span style="">When he gave a gesture, they would either deal him the card he wanted, or tell him what the opponent had.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Even so, he failed to win even once.</span></p><p><span style="">Li Zheng laughed and tapped the table with his fingers.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Am I not winning too much alone? I&#x2019;m truly very sorry about this.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Li Zheng&#x2019;s funds, which started at 1.14 billion won, suddenly increased by 200 million.&#xA0;</span><span style="">On the other hand, Yamaguchi and Caterina&#x2019;s money had been reduced by 100 million each.</span></p><p><span style="">Yamaguchi clicked his tongue as he looked at Li Zheng.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I had a lot of confidence in this game, but it seems like you came up with the best winning strategy.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">It was a face that Yamaguchi badly wanted to slice apart with a samurai sword.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The fact that he couldn&#x2019;t do that was really unfortunate.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Cough!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Caterina was also watching the game with nervous eyes.&#xA0;</span><span style="">She had to do something, but it was a situation where her head would be blown away if she did anything wrong.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;......&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">There was a sniper rifle outside the door, so what could she do?</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;...It is my mistake.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Why didn&#x2019;t she notice such a simple trick?&#xA0;</span><span style="">The subordinates she brought were waiting outside the building.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The rule was that only the boss and their lieutenant could enter.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Finally, a weapon couldn&#x2019;t be brought into the casino.</span></p><p><span style="">This applied to all teams.&#xA0;</span><span style="">At first glance, it seemed to be a rule that aimed for competing in pure skills rather than force.&#xA0;</span><span style="">But in reality, there were gaps in the conditions that would lead to foul play.</span></p><p><span style="">If she had been thinking calmly, then she would&#x2019;ve read Li Zheng&#x2019;s intentions when he wanted to send out their lieutenants.&#xA0;</span><span style="">However, Caterina and Yamaguchi had gotten carried away with their winning strategies.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Thus, they didn&#x2019;t think of the simple method of &#x2018;threatening the opponent with a gun.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;A mafia boss shouldn&#x2019;t use such a lowly trick.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Caterina glared at the man aiming the gun from outside the door.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He fired a bullet and destroyed a table.&#xA0;</span><span style="">If Caterina didn&#x2019;t follow Li Zheng&#x2019;s words, then she would end up like that.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Kuohh, huhuhu... I won.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Li Zheng swept up the chips with a cheerful expression.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Caterina asked with a humiliated look.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Can you finish it quickly? Yes. You won.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">A laser pointer was aimed at her head while playing the game.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was a horrible feeling.</span></p><p><span style="">Li Zheng smiled.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I&#x2019;d love to, but I can only bet a few chips at once. Still, if it continues like this then I can become first within the time limit. Oh, Girlie. You seem quite good at calculating in your head. Calculate how long it will be until I want a drink.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Li Zheng smiled at Caterina with a relaxed expression.&#xA0;</span><span style="">There was nothing she could do.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Don&#x2019;t blame me too much. I just brought the most useful subordinate.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">An emotionless dealer gave a card to Yamaguchi and Li Zheng.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Thanks to the incense, the dealers would follow Yamaguchi&#x2019;s orders.&#xA0;</span><span style="">However, it was impossible for the dealers to overpower the opponents armed with guns.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Oh, what a shame. You picked a 10. Will you forfeit straight away? You can save some time.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;C-Cough!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Yamaguchi narrowed his eyes and coughed.&#xA0;</span><span style="">But the Yakuza boss, who had thousands of subordinates, was just a weak old man.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He would be lucky if he didn&#x2019;t lose his life.&#xA0;</span><span style="">However, being deprived of Phantom was a very painful thing.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The initiative of being active in South Korea would be passed to the opponent.&#xA0;</span><span style="">In particular, the Yakuza still had something to do in South Korea so they absolutely wanted to prevent another organization from obtaining it.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Ah, yes. There was that number.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Yamaguchi closed his eyes and tried to come up with a plausible plan.&#xA0;</span><span style="">There was a saying in Japan about turning over the table.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It would happen when there was an unpleasant situation.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Overturn the table itself.</span></p><p><span style="">More than this...</span></p><p><span style="">Li Zheng grabbed the chips again and said,</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;There are a lot of complaints because I keep winning. Sorry. Then let&#x2019;s replace the players. Next, I should obtain some chips from the girl.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;......&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Caterina swapped places with Yamaguchi silently.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Up to this point, it seemed like the fight over Phantom would end with Li Zheng&#x2019;s complete victory.</span></p><p><span style="">@</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk waited for the perfect timing.</span></p><p><span style="">The bosses who participated in the mafia game didn&#x2019;t notice the most important condition.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was decided with mutual agreement that the game would take place in three rounds.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Regardless of the middle ranking, the person with the most chips at the end would get Phantom.</span></p><p><span style="">So what would happen if the game ended and all of the mafias had the same amount of money?&#xA0;</span><span style="">The answer was that nothing would change.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Phantom would continue to operate freely without belonging anywhere.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The mafia would have a subtle war of nerves in South Korea.</span></p><p><span style="">It was the mafia game itself that Tae-hyuk was aiming for.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Everybody has prepared one winning strategy for the mafia game. It is the same with me as well.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The third round was reaching its end.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Right now, the mafia&#x2019;s money was perfectly tied at 1.43 billion won. And there was a 10 million won chip on the table.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The winner of this round would be Phantom&#x2019;s owner.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I guess I have to go.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk put on the opera mask and headed to the casino.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;P-Phantom?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;C-Cough.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Oh, have you come to celebrate my victory?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Li Zheng laughed as he played the last game at the table.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Now we are on the same side. Despite the past, we should get along now! There is still something I want from Phantom.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Of course, Li Zheng would dispose of Phantom after a year or so.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Before that, he wanted to know the secret of Phantom&#x2019;s abilities.&#xA0;</span><span style="">While hiding such darkness, Li Zheng welcomed Phantom with a smile.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk approached the table and asked,</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;But didn&#x2019;t you notice one strange thing?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Strange?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Why is everyone in here, except for you, wearing a mask?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;T-That is because they are your fellow Phantoms.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;That is a preconceived notion. Why didn&#x2019;t a person with a similar victory strategy notice it?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;D-Don&#x2019;t tell me...!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk pulled out a plastic sheet folded under the opera mask.&#xA0;</span><span style="">After some manipulation, it became a good gas mask.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Phantom wasn&#x2019;t using a plain mask.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Now, do you all understand?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk sent a signal and the cameramen all turned their masks into gas masks.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The spellbound dealers just stared into the air blankly.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;D-Damn! Phantom deceived us!&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;You should always be aware of the situation. Gas! Gas! Gas!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">At Tae-hyuk&#x2019;s orders, the cameramen took something out. Gray smoke poured out from it.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Phantom...!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Li Zheng tried to escape the smoke but couldn&#x2019;t because it happened so quickly.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Now have a good sleep. Everything will have ended once you wake up.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;G-Greenhorn...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Phantom... W-Why...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Yamaguchi and Caterina stared at Phantom with confused eyes.&#xA0;</span><span style="">However, it didn&#x2019;t last long.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The powerful sleeping gas put them to sleep in an instant.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;......&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;&#x2026;...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;&#x2026;&#x2026;&#x2026;.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Li Zheng was fast asleep without being able to protest the unfairness of the situation.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Tae-hyuk placed the remaining red chip on the table into his pocket and muttered.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;After the game is over, the chip left on the table is a tip right? There is still a little bit until the end. It will be tough to break them before that, so I will use the tip well.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Li Zheng, Yamaguchi and Caterina all had 1.43 billion won in chips.&#xA0;</span><span style="">However, there were still 10 minutes until the mafia game finished.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Ah, yes. Shall I play doctor while I am bored waiting?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Phantom brought out a surgical tool.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Tae-hyuk alternated between looking at it and at the mafia bosses collapsed on the ground.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Then he laughed like a criminal.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;...Illegal Surgery. Start.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">@</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Ugh...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;This place...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;...P-Phantom!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">As the sleeping gas wore off, the participants of the mafia game woke up.&#xA0;</span><span style="">They were lying on top of chairs that had been brought from somewhere.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Tae-hyuk spoke from where he was organizing his surgical tools.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Everyone was tired from playing games all night so you slept like logs. But what should I do? The game time ran out while you were sleeping.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Y-Y-You put us to sleep with a gas!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk smiled gently at Li Zheng.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Can you say that?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">It was a reminder that he had threatened the other bosses with guns just two hours ago.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He never thought he would be the one tricked.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Li Zheng&#x2019;s anger boiled up.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Then let&#x2019;s do the final closing. The Triad has 1.43 billion.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Damn!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;The Yakuza has 1.43 billion.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;K-Kuhuk!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;The Red Mafia has 1.43 billion.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;......&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk declared proudly.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Unbelievable! Coincidentally, all three teams have tied. The game is null and void.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Yamaguchi and Li Zheng dropped their heads after realizing they had lost the game.&#xA0;</span><span style="">They never thought that at the last minute...</span></p><p><span style="">At that moment, Caterina quietly said,</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;N-No Phantom. The game can&#x2019;t end in a tie. Clearly, the total betting amount if 4.3 billion. Once divided between teams, there should be 10 million won left.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Oh, that 10 million won? The chip left at the table is the dealer&#x2019;s tip. I am grateful for it.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Caterina had the most desire for Phantom among the three people so she stuck to it until the end.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Isn&#x2019;t that just the case in a regular casino? Obviously there wasn&#x2019;t such a rule in the rules that you gave us.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hrmm, that&#x2019;s right.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Certainly.</span></p><p><span style="">Yamaguchi and Li Zheng also added.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Yes. The game isn&#x2019;t over.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I also agree.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Caterina glared at Li Zheng for interrupting.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He had tried to kill her so why was he suddenly pretending to be friends?</span></p><p><span style="">However, the game wasn&#x2019;t finished yet.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Tae-hyuk licked his lips and nodded.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Then let&#x2019;s start the fourth round of the mafia game. There will just be one difference.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;W-What?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Me too.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;A-Aren&#x2019;t you the master of the casino? If you want, then you can increase your chips as you like. It is unfair!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;You don&apos;t have to worry about increasing the chips.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;What does that mean?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I mean, I&#x2019;m going to win with this one chip.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk raised the 10 million won chip.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;The rules of the 4th round are simple. If you make me broke, then you win.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;P-Playing with just one chip? T-That is ridiculous! Bluff Poker is an overwhelmingly advantageous game when there are a lot of chips!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;If you want then I can fight all three people at the same time. Bring it on.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Phantom&apos;s declaration of war caused the fighting spirits of the participants to burn.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I haven&#x2019;t given up yet Phantom.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Huhu, this will be fun.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I-I am going to win.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The bosses had a total of 429 chips.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Phantom had only one!</span></p><p><span style="">With this ridiculous difference, the last Bluff Poker of the mafia game began.</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p>
