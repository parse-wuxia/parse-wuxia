<p><span style="">Chapter 54: Black Sheep Exodus #1 &#xA0;</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p><p><span style="">The participants in the Death Circus had a moment when they wished they had refused to join.</span></p><p><span style="">It was the time when the fee needed to be paid every hour.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Of course, it wasn&#x2019;t pleasurable to risk their lives by challenging difficult attractions or by paying money to other people.&#xA0;</span><span style="">But it was a choice they could make with their own will.&#xA0;</span><span style="">At the very least, it was their money, not their lives, that was being taken away.</span></p><p><span style="">If they knew that there was this nonsensical system in the first place, then no one would have signed the application.&#xA0;</span><span style="">But most of them had been thinking about suicide because they didn&#x2019;t have the money to pay off their debts.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Some were fooled by the idea of making big money from this.</span></p><p><span style="">Yoon Jong-hyun was stuck here for a similar reason.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I can&#x2019;t die until I kill that Choi Sung-yeol bastard!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The Death Circus was a hell that appeared in reality.</span></p><p><span style="">Yoon Jong-hyun had a fairly good head.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He realized that based on the rules of this place, most of the participants would die.&#xA0;</span><span style="">In the near future, he might end up suffering from a painful end.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Thus, it would be better to commit suicide with his own hands early on.</span></p><p><span style="">However, Yoon Jong-hyun&#x2019;s hatred for Choi Sung-yeol kept him alive.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Sometimes vengeance was a driving force in life.</span></p><p><span style="">But now it was the end.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The remaining number on his badge was 5.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Five million won.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was the cost of living comfortably for a few months on the outside. However, in here, it wouldn&#x2019;t even keep him alive for an hour.</span></p><p><span style="">So instead of getting revenge on Choi Sung-yeol who lied to him, 20 minutes later he would be challenging the attraction of death.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Just when Yoon Jong-hyun was in the midst of despair, someone spoke to him.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I guess you don&#x2019;t have enough money to pay the fee.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Yoon Jong-hyun replied in a loud voice.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Yes. Are you asking that after seeing the badge on my chest? Stop joking...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Yoon Jong-hyun trailed off as he saw the badge on the opponent&#x2019;s chest.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;3...300 million!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">If his eyes were wrong, then 360 was clearly written on there.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The money needed to get out of here was 200 million.&#xA0;</span><span style="">A huge amount of 160 million would remain after he escaped.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Yoon Jong-hyun realized that the young man in front of him could save his life.</span></p><p><span style="">Yoon Jong-hyun literally fell to the ground.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Then he grabbed the pants of the other person.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;P-Please. Can you give me a little bit of money? No, please help me. 30... No, if you lend me 20 million then I will pay back double the amount. Please...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">His life was at stake.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Yoon Jong-hyun looked at the person&#x2019;s badge.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It stated that his name was Lee Cheol-su.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Teacher Cheol-su...! It is a request!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk coughed a few times and said as smoothly as possible.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;You don&#x2019;t need to do this. First of all, listen to my words.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;W-what...?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;If you do a few things for me, then I will pay your fee. How about it?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Yoon Jong-hyun didn&#x2019;t answer right away, since Cheol-su could be trying to trick him.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Furthermore, even though he didn&#x2019;t have any money, he might be a bait to deceive others.&#xA0;</span><span style="">This was the Death Circus after all.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It wasn&#x2019;t easy to trust a person in a place like this.&#xA0;</span><span style="">But even so, there was nothing else he could do in his rotten situation.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I know what you are thinking. You can listen to my words and not do it if you don&#x2019;t like it. I want you to collect all the people who are in danger because they don&#x2019;t have enough money. Of course, we don&#x2019;t want them to play the final game.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;This means...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes. I will pay all of their fees. If you look at the money I have then you know that it is possible.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;O-Oh my god... God...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;At any rate, there isn&#x2019;t much time remaining, so please hurry. I will explain more once the people are gathered here.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;......!&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;You can treat me as a scammer, but there is no other choice.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Yoon Jong-hyun nodded as he looked at the face of his saviour.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes! I-I understand!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Yoon Jong-hyun thought about it as he ran around.&#xA0;</span><span style="">If the other person had used more plausible words then he wouldn&#x2019;t have trusted them.&#xA0;</span><span style="">However, the man called Cheol-su said that Jong-hyun could doubt him as much as he wanted.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It strangely gave him a sense of trust.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was the opposite of Choi Sung-yeol&#x2019;s method of luring people with sweet words.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk confirmed the time as he was left alone.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He had said the same thing to three people apart from Yoon Jong-hyun.&#xA0;</span><span style="">If they moved in a hurry, then it wouldn&#x2019;t be too late to gather the people.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Every minute and second was precious.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk looked at the camera and laughed.</span></p><p><span style="">@</span></p><p><span style="">10 minutes ahead of the payment time, six people were gathered in front of him.&#xA0;</span><span style="">They were all people in danger because they didn&#x2019;t have enough money for the fee payment.&#xA0;</span><span style="">They looked at Tae-hyuk like he was their saviour.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk said.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;You were deceived.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">There was a huge uproar.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;W-What?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Are you deceiving us now?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;T-This bastard...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">However, Tae-hyuk&#x2019;s 360 million didn&#x2019;t change.&#xA0;</span><span style="">They couldn&#x2019;t do anything but count down the minutes.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk replied with a smile.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I had decided to give the fee to you. But in the end, that idea isn&#x2019;t enough.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;W-What do you mean?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;First of all, let me tell you my purpose.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk briefly looked at the six people.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Most of them were men in their 30~40s.&#xA0;</span><span style="">They had little or no money.&#xA0;</span><span style="">They swallowed their saliva and waited for Tae-hyuk to speak.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I want to escape from the Death Circus with everyone.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;......!&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk had collected six people using the bait of 10 million won.</span></p><p><span style="">The reason was simple.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Right now, there shouldn&#x2019;t be a wolf hiding in this group.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was a collection of specifically selected people.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">There were two conditions.</span></p><p><span style="">They should have no money.&#xA0;</span><span style="">A person who couldn&#x2019;t do anything before the thought of death.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">The people who satisfied these conditions absolutely couldn&#x2019;t be wolves.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The only woman among the gathered people raised her hand.&#xA0;</span><span style="">She was a timid-looking woman in her early 30s.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;W-Will you really save us?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;That will be the result.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ah... Thank you... Thank you very much...!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The woman bowed until her head was touching the ground.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;...Ugh. H-Her chest all of a sudden...&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">At that moment, Tae-hyuk&#x2019;s conscience showed itself.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It wasn&#x2019;t simply through goodwill that Tae-hyuk wanted to help these people escape. &#xA0;</span><span style="">It was so that he could break the Death Circus and Tiwai.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He gathered this crowd as part of his plan.</span></p><p><span style="">&apos;You are being used! Don&#x2019;t look at me with such expressions of respect! I&#x2019;m a bad person!&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk wanted to shout those words, but he stopped himself.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The rules that Kim Joon-young created for the Death Circus were absolute.&#xA0;</span><span style="">There were many masked witnesses watching.</span></p><p><span style="">However, if the death penalty ended and all guests disappeared, then this promise would be discarded.&#xA0;</span><span style="">No matter how much money he made here, he wouldn&#x2019;t be able to take it outside.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It would just turn into a piece of data on the badge.</span></p><p><span style="">In the end, he had to finish everything while the guests were still here.</span></p><p><span style="">Those who didn&#x2019;t know that Tae-hyuk was plotting a wicked conspiracy spoke with touched expressions.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I-I really want to escape from here...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Bringing out all the participants...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Yoon Jong-hyun, who was mixed among the people, opened his mouth.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;If this succeeds then it will be a miracle like the Exodus.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Exodus?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes. The Exodus from the bible. Moses received a revelation from god and took those who were slaves to escape from Egypt. He took them to a land of paradise. Doesn&#x2019;t that seem like the exact same situation now?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ah...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Hmm.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk coughed at Yoon Jong-hyun.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He was now treated as Moses.&#xA0;</span><span style="">However, no matter how many crime skills he had, he couldn&#x2019;t split the sea in two.</span></p><p><span style="">There was only one thing he could do.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Then I will give each of you 10 million won and put you in Group A. After this fee settlement is over, I want you to spread this fact to others in the Death Circus. Everybody has a means of escape.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;T-That is all you need?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes. The next instructions will be in 20 minutes.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I-I understand.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Those who received money from Tae-hyuk bowed their heads and ran to other places in the Death Circus.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hu...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">There was a way for all participants to live.&#xA0;</span><span style="">That information would surely spread around the Death Circus in an instant.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was what Tae-hyuk was aiming at.</span></p><p><span style="">The participants would no longer need to take part in dangerous attractions or gambling.&#xA0;</span><span style="">They had a new hope that they could leave this place alive.</span></p><p><span style="">Once that happened, the remaining wolves wouldn&#x2019;t be able to hunt.&#xA0;</span><span style="">They would hide their identities and approach Tae-hyuk.</span></p><p><span style="">Thus, he invested 20 minutes to gather the Group A.&#xA0;</span><span style="">People who couldn&#x2019;t hurt others despite being in a dangerous situation.&#xA0;</span><span style="">They absolutely weren&#x2019;t wolves.&#xA0;</span><span style="">They would be the main axis for the Exodus.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk finally contacted Moonlight Flower, who was the most important figure of this operation.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He smiled at the surveillance camera and made a shooting motion with his fingers.</span></p><p><span style="">It meant to report the current situation.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Of course, it also provoked the people watching him.</span></p><p><span style="">The reply arrived in seconds.</span></p><p><span style="">[P1 Panel]</span></p><p><span style="">-It was destroyed by a strong shock.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk smiled as he saw the message on the Demon Revealing Mirror.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The content of the message sent by Moonlight Flower was simple.</span></p><p><span style="">-No problem!</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk was inside while Moonlight Flower was outside.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The operation to crush the Death Circus was </span><span style="">progressing gradually.</span></p><p><span style="">@</span></p><p><span style="">The wolf hid among the sheep.</span></p><p><span style="">Of course, it was in order to eat the black sheep.</span></p><p><span style="">@</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk looked at the gathered people.</span></p><p><span style="">Group A had done well and almost all of the living participants of the Death Circus were gathered.&#xA0;</span><span style="">There were exactly two people missing.</span></p><p><span style="">&apos;Indeed, the Tae-soo and Dae-soo brothers aren&#x2019;t here.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">Wounded wolves would be eaten by other wolves.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Maybe they already...</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I think you know why I gathered you here.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Then one participant shouted.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Are you really going to save us from this place?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;It could be as a result.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;What do you mean?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I am going to escape from the Death Circus from now on. I will take all the people here with me. But there is something you have to do for that to happen.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;......!&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">The gathered people started buzzing again.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;You can&#x2019;t escape from here using normal methods. In order to get out, you need to collect 200 million according to Kim Joon-young&#x2019;s rules. I&#x2019;m not a saviour. I&#x2019;m just going to give you a definite path.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">It was at that moment.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The wolf hiding in Group B walked forward.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Doesn&#x2019;t that mean we have to participate in dangerous attractions after all? How can we believe you? Aren&#x2019;t you a spy sent by the organizers of the Death Circus? Everybody is deceived by that man. If you follow him, then you will die.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;......!&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">The words were plausible.</span></p><p><span style="">The man who was throwing suspicion towards Tae-hyuk.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Tae-hyuk confirmed his name.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Kim Jun-tae.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">It was strangely similar to someone&#x2019;s name.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Tae-hyuk narrowed his eyes and looked at the other person.</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p>
