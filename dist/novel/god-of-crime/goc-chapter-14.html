<p><span style="">Chapter 14: Having Too Much of a Good Thing&#xA0;</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p><p><span style="">&quot;Ah, am I late?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">An Eun-young was hardly able to walk due to her shock.</span></p><p><span style="">In the end, Tae-hyuk had to piggyback her home.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Her body was lighter than Tae-hyuk had expected, so he felt uncomfortable.</span></p><p><span style="">How could this small girl confront Park Sung-kwang?</span></p><p><span style="">In his memories, An Eun-young was just a sincere and hard-working model student.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk sighed inwardly.</span></p><p><span style="">It was less of a return to the past and more of having memories of the future.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He could take advantage of those memories.</span></p><p><span style="">However, that wasn&#x2019;t the end of it.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Tae-hyuk learnt things he had never known before.</span></p><p><span style="">Teacher Jung Nam-ho helped his students in secret...&#xA0;</span><span style="">And An Eun-young was fighting on her own.</span></p><p><span style="">Until now, Tae-hyuk had been a mere bystander.&#xA0;</span><span style="">However, his position had changed now, and he was jumping onto the stage out of his own free will.&#xA0;</span><span style="">There was nothing else he could do except to fight.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk looked at his watch.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">His sister had told him not to go home too late. However, it was already past 10 in the evening.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He had sent her a message, but she would worry if he was even later.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk hurried forward.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Uh, what are they doing?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">There was a strange shadow on the wall to an alley.</span></p><p><span style="">The person was wearing clothes that completely exposed the body.</span></p><p><span style="">It looked like a young woman...</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;...Did she forget the keys to her house?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk shook his head.</span></p><p><span style="">He couldn&apos;t afford to worry about others things right now. His head was full of complicated thoughts just from thinking about An Eun-young.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk ignored the suspicious woman and headed home to where his sister was waiting.</span></p><p></p><p style="text-align: center"><span style="">* &#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;* &#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;*</span></p><p></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Tae-hyuk! Aren&#x2019;t you going home? Classes are over!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Jung Nam-ho asked Tae-hyuk, who strangely had remained in the classroom.</span></p><p><span style="">He didn&#x2019;t seem to be sleeping with his eyes open...</span></p><p><span style="">It had been his routine to run off after lunch without waiting for school to end.</span></p><p><span style="">Seo Tae-hyuk scratched his head and replied,</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Ah, I have decided to study from today.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Jung Nam-ho hit Tae-hyuk&#x2019;s head with the attendance sheet.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ouch!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Strange. This isn&#x2019;t a dream. Did I eat something bad at lunch today?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;......&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk was at a loss for words. Was it that surprising that he had decided to study?</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Then work hard. I&#x2019;m going.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes. See you tomorrow.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">After Teacher Jung Nam-ho left, An Eun-young moved and sat next to Tae-hyuk.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Tae-hyuk, then... let&#x2019;s start studying.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Uh, Class President. You&#x2019;re not stuttering anymore?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Eung? Really?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">An Eun-young laughed gently.</span></p><p><span style="">The two people stayed behind because Tae-hyuk had asked for An Eun-young&#x2019;s help with studying.</span></p><p><span style="">&apos;Well, I also want to stop Park Sung-kwang from touching her.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">The test was two days later.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">Park Sung-kwang realized that he had been deceived and was now burning with hostility toward Tae-hyuk.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;He didn&#x2019;t do anything during the day due to his reputation, but it should now be time for him to approach.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk studied while waiting for Park Sung-kwang.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Well, then I&#x2019;ll check your skills.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">In order to teach someone, she first needed to know their skills.</span></p><p><span style="">An Eun-young made a test paper that mixed simple problems and difficult problems.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk received it and concentrated.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Um, I just solved what I knew. How about it?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Eung...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">An Eun-young gave a strange moan as she started to check the problems.</span></p><p><span style="">Then she spoke in an oddly angry voice,</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Tae-hyuk, you. Don&#x2019;t you study?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Eek?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;The problems that require application are a problem. However, the very basic questions are wrong. Normally, this means that you don&#x2019;t study.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;T-then I will try harder from now on.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Really? Then... I think I can help. However, you will need to give up on the next test. This is still your second year. If you work hard, you can get good results in the next test. First of all, mathematics...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">An Eun-young explained the curriculum to Seo Tae-hyuk.</span></p><p><span style="">She knew exactly what it took to improve his grades.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;As expected from Class President... Amazing.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I-it&#x2019;s no big deal.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">An Eun-young shook her head with embarrassment at Tae-hyuk&#x2019;s praise.</span></p><p><span style="">She tucked her hair behind her ears and started teaching him in earnest.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk focused on An Eun-young&#x2019;s words.</span></p><p><span style="">Why was her face slightly flushed?</span></p><p><span style="">Was the classroom hot?</span></p><p><span style="">Approximately 30 minutes passed by.</span></p><p><span style="">All of a sudden, the Demon Revealing Mirror, that he had placed on the desk, rang.</span></p><p><span style="">[You have focused on studying.]</span></p><p><span style="">[You have been influenced by An Eun-young&#x2019;s Studying skill and your stats are rising quickly.]</span></p><p><span style="">[Intelligence has increased by one!]</span></p><p><span style="">&apos;Rising stats...?&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">It was a message he had never seen before.</span></p><p><span style="">He wanted to examine it, but he felt sorry towards An Eun-young who was studying hard.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk stretched and said,</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Let&apos;s rest for five minutes.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Eung? It has only been 30 minutes... although you </span><i><span style="">have</span></i><span style=""> worked hard. Shall we take a break?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Then I will go to the bathroom.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Eung.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Please note that it is a big one.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I didn&#x2019;t ask!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">An Eun-young stood up and stretched. Tae-hyuk took the Demon Revealing Mirror with him and left the classroom.</span></p><p></p><p style="text-align: center"><span style="">* &#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;* &#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;*</span></p><p></p><p>&#x2018;Is it because I got the Spying skill?&#x2019;</p><p><span style="">&#x2018;You can use the opponent&apos;s ability and skills to spy on your belongings.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">In other words, he could see his own stats.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk decided to try it on himself first.</span></p><p><span style="">[Spying has been used.]</span></p><p><span style="">[You can see your opponent&apos;s belongings and stats]</span></p><p><span style="">Along with the message about activating the skill, the abilities of &#x2018;Seo Tae-hyuk&#x2019; popped up.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">There was also a bag of belongings, but there was no reason to look at it.</span></p><p><span style="">[Seo Tae-hyuk]</span></p><p><span style="">-Title: God of Crime</span></p><p><span style="">-Rating: Commoner (Lacking conditions for upgrade)</span></p><p><span style="">-Skills Possessed: Robbery (Lv 1)</span></p><p><span style="">&#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0;Voice Modulation (Lv 1)</span></p><p><span style="">&#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0;Spying (Lv 1)</span></p><p><span style="">-Stats: Stamina (64), Intelligence (4), Agility (22), Dexterity (31)</span></p><p><span style="">[You can raise your stats by using affinity points.]</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;What is this...? F-fool!&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk clicked his tongue.</span></p><p><span style="">Compared to his other stats, his intelligence was too low.</span></p><p><span style="">Moreover, this was after he had just gained one point.</span></p><p><span style="">He had only tempered his body, so his stamina was high.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;I really have to study harder...&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">It seemed like he had to take care of An Eun-young from now on.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk thought about the message that had popped up previously.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;The Studying skill...&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">He learnt that crime skills weren&#x2019;t the only skills he could get.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">An Eun-young didn&#x2019;t seem to have the same abilities as him.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Did he have to study hard to get it?</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Um. This time...&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">He shone the Demon Revealing Mirror on An Eun-young in the classroom.</span></p><p><span style="">Then Spying was activated.</span></p><p><span style="">[An Eun-young]&#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">-Title: Good Model Student</span></p><p><span style="">[The details aren&#x2019;t available due to your low rating.]</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk&apos;s eyes trembled.</span></p><p><span style="">&apos;Does she have a higher rating than me?&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">If he was a commoner, An Eun-young had to be at least a noble.</span></p><p><span style="">Come to think of it, An Eun-young was very good at studying.&#xA0;</span><span style="">She was first place in the school and her nationwide rank was quite high.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;I don&#x2019;t know her exact rating but maybe it&#x2019;s &#x2018;King&#x2019;.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Either way, I have to raise my rating if I want to use the skill properly.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">An Eun-young was the owner of the Studying skill.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was fortunate that he was getting close to her.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He could easily increase his low intelligence stat.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Thank you, Class President! I will buy you a hamburger later!&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">As Tae-hyuk was sending love calls to An Eun-young in his mind, someone approached him.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hrmm. You&#x2019;re finally out.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">It was Park Sung-kwang.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Wah, has he been waiting outside until now? How sad. If I look closely, isn&#x2019;t that snow piled up on his shoulders?&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk thought with a serious expression.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Haha. There is no need to panic. I don&#x2019;t plan to do anything to you. Take a look, I am alone right now.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I wasn&#x2019;t scared though?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Park Sung-kwang&#x2019;s eyes twitched.</span></p><p><span style="">However, he spoke with true superhuman patience,</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;... Hum, hum. At any rate, it is good that you&#x2019;re not making a fuss. I don&apos;t know what you&#x2019;ve heard. Despite my reputation, you can trust me. So, why don&#x2019;t you receive some money for staying out of things?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Staying out?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I mean, stop hanging around Class President. Isn&#x2019;t that more comfortable for both of you?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">It meant to leave An Eun-young&#x2019;s side.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk lowered his tone like he was worried.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Money... I </span><i><span style="">do</span></i><span style=""> need it.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Those are good words. 50... No, I&apos;ll give you one million won.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk held up five fingers.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I need this much?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Cough. Five million... You sure can make a bargain. Yes... I&#x2019;m in a great mood, so...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk folded his fingers, leaving only his index finger that he shook back and forth.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;No, 500 million. Class President helped me with things I&#x2019;ve been struggling to learn. Shouldn&#x2019;t it be at least this much?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;5&#x2026; 500 million?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">It wasn&#x2019;t five million but 500 million? That was 100 times the money.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Puhahaha! Crazy. You are crazy. You&#x2019;ll have to go round and round chasing for that money.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Park Sung-kwang laughed.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;You seem to be mistaken about something. You think you&#x2019;ve caught my weakness. This is a problem that I can solve on my own, without my father&#x2019;s help. Yes. The negotiating is over.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Well, I guess so.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I will do everything I can to destroy you. From now on, it&#x2019;s war, Seo Tae-hyuk.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Park Sung-kwang declared and walked off.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk laughed as he watched Park Sung-kwang leave.</span></p><p><span style="">Then he muttered in a low voice,</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;This move turned out as nicely as I thought it would. Yeah, it should be like this. Now, who will be the one destroyed?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">In fact, Tae-hyuk didn&#x2019;t have any special feelings or hostility towards Park Sung-kwang.</span></p><p><span style="">He was just an obstacle blocking An Eun-young from helping Tae-hyuk study.</span></p><p><span style="">However, the problem was different since he needed to obtain the Spying skill.</span></p><p><span style="">It was an essential skill.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">In order to perfectly learn it, he had to stab Park Sung-kwang.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Well, isn&#x2019;t this Class President&#x2019;s revenge? Let&#x2019;s call it the tuition fee. Park Sung-kwang, sorry. Who told you to give me such a good skill?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Anyway, it wasn&#x2019;t the time to return to studying.</span></p><p><span style="">Park Sung-kwang had moved first.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">Now, it was his turn.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk apologized to An Eun-young and made a phone call.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Senator&#x2019;s secretary, Park Sung-hwan?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The plan to destroy Park Sung-kwang had begun.</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p>
