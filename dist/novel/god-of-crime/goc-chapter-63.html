<p><span style="">Chapter 63 - Bomber #1 &#xA0;</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p><p><span style="">It was late in the afternoon when an unidentified courier delivered a package to Gangdong Police Station.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The first person to find it was a new policewoman from the city traffic department, who was cleaning when she found the box in a corner.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Eh? Who is this for?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Then an officer returning to work spoke to the policewoman.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Isn&#x2019;t it Detective Oh?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Ah, good job Sunbae-nim! Detective Oh?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes. He receives orders here because he can&#x2019;t get them at home.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">It was one of the good things about not being married.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Speaking of which-</span></p><p><span style="">Detective Oh was walking down the hallway when the new policewoman waved her hand.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Detective Oh! Did you order something?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Detective Oh stopped with a confused expression.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;What do you mean? My wife found my savings so I couldn&#x2019;t even if I wanted to. Aigoo. That fishing rod...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ahaha...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The courier package wasn&#x2019;t for Detective Oh.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The policewoman looked at the courier box with suspicious eyes.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Hrmm...&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Something is fishy...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Looking at the details, the recipient seemed to be Team 2 of the Kangdong Police Station.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The sender address was written, but it wasn&#x2019;t an actual address when they searched it up.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The name written on the package was also fake.</span></p><p><span style="">The police officers groaned.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Perhaps they had discovered something immense.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What is going on?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The policewoman&#x2019;s eyes widened as a man&#x2019;s voice was heard.&#xA0;</span><span style="">A recently popular detective, Cho Kang-suk was glancing at them curiously.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ah, Detective Cho Kang-suk!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">He was the biggest celebrity at Kangdong Police Station.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He threw his body at Yoo Cheol-ho, the escaped prisoner, who had the whole country in an uproar.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Not long ago, he played a crucial role in arresting the hippo.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Furthermore, he had recently been paying attention to his appearance, and was now like a wild detective from a &#xA0;movie.</span></p><p><span style="">The policewoman couldn&#x2019;t understand why he was still single.&#xA0;</span><span style="">If he wasn&#x2019;t meeting anyone...</span></p><p><span style="">Her face turned red at the thought.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Can I take a look at it for a moment?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes, yes! Take a look!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The police officers raised their voices, as if they had met a famous celebrity.</span></p><p><span style="">Kang-suk coughed and eyed the courier box suspiciously.</span></p><p><span style="">The size seemed to be the smallest one available among the post office boxes, and the edges were slightly crushed from the delivery.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He sniffed it but there weren&#x2019;t any smells coming from the package.&#xA0;</span><span style="">That was all that could be seen from the outward appearance.</span></p><p><span style="">Kang-suk looked serious when he was told that this was left behind by a courier.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It meant that moving it wasn&#x2019;t dangerous.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Something heavy?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">He carefully lifted the box and noted that it had a considerable weight.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Something is shaking. Is there liquid inside?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Kang-suk thought back to the devices that he learned of back at the police academy.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He might be making a fool of himself, but it wasn&#x2019;t bad to be careful.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Kang-suk put the box on the table carefully and called Kim Do-shik.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Inspector, it is Kang-suk. It seems like a bomb might have been delivered to the police station. Can you call EOD?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Kang-suk asked Kim Do-shik to officially dispatch the explosives squad.</span></p><p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">What?</span></i> <i><span style="">I understand.</span></i> <i><span style="">Don&#x2019;t touch it!</span></i></p><p><span style="">A lazy afternoon.</span></p><p><span style="">There was an uproar among the police officers working in Kangdong Police Station.</span></p><p><span style="">IED.</span></p><p><span style="">A bomb was delivered.</span></p><p><span style="">@</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Be careful! Be careful...! If there is any wrong shock or jostle, then the entire police station could go flying away!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Kim Do-shik gave instructions to the crew who specialized in handling explosives.&#xA0;</span><span style="">There were various tools ranging from liquid nitrogen to shock absorbers on the table.</span></p><p><span style="">There were various forms among the homemade bombs, such as exploding when a certain impact was given or exploding when the box was opened.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The most famous was the time bomb that was connected to a clock and exploded at the appointed time.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;It is opened.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Well done!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The lid of the courier box was carefully opened so that no vibrations would be transmitted inside.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Kim Do-shik&#x2019;s eyes widened in an instant.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;T-This...!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">It was a plastic bowl filled with red liquid, with wires intricately connected to it like blood vessels connected to a heart.</span></p><p><span style="">Kim Do-shik&#x2019;s eyes flashed at the sight. He knew what this was all too well.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;...Liquid bomb!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The explosives agent started to carefully explore what the liquid was.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Fortunately, it doesn&#x2019;t seem to be methyl nitrate. It seems to be nitromethane.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Kim Do-shik&#x2019;s expression changed slightly.</span></p><p><span style="">Methyl nitrate exploded by mixing with other liquids, even if there wasn&#x2019;t a detonator.&#xA0;</span><span style="">However, nitromethane didn&#x2019;t burst unless there was a very strong impact.</span></p><p><span style="">The agent said carefully,</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;This amount is enough for an entire street to fly away. However, there doesn&#x2019;t seem to be a detonator.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hrmm? Detective Cho, did you find this? Is there another?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Then Cho Kang-suk scratched his head and said.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;No. The two who found it were from the traffic department. I just found it suspicious.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Haha. You aren&#x2019;t an expert, yet you realized that this is a homemade bomb.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;It was also taught at the police academy... It was because I had a feeling.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;As expected from Cho Kang-suk&#x2019;s senses. At any rate, process that with the utmost care. Detective Cho will be responsible for finding the source and route of the courier.</span></p><p><span style="">Cho Kang-suk scratched his head as he heard Kim Do-shik&#x2019;s words.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes. I understand.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Kang-suk wondered about the intentions of the perpetrator who sent this bomb to the police station, but he wasn&#x2019;t Hyun-ho who majored in psychology.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He just needed to catch the culprit.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It seemed like he would have to work overnight again for a while.</span></p><p><span style="">At that moment, one woman came up in Kang-suk&#x2019;s mind.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He had his first date with her a while ago, and soon, they would meet again.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Although it would be difficult for a while.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He would confess at that time...</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Uh, can I see the courier box for a moment?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Kang-suk noticed something strange.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Sound recorder...?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">There was an old voice storage device placed in a corner of the box.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Kang-suk asked the explosives disposal personnel.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Is it okay to touch?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes. The detonator is removed. Even if there is a device that responds to vibration, it won&#x2019;t break.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hrmm...!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Kang-suk carefully grabbed the tape recorder.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He tried to check for the culprit&#x2019;s fingerprints, but it had been wiped clean.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What on earth is this?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The homemade bomb looked mysterious to Kang-suk.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It seemed like the culprit was an IED expert, which was rare in Korea.&#xA0;</span><span style="">However, if they provided a tape recorder then they were clearly planning something.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Kang-suk discovered the cassette tape in the recorder.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Inspector. Let me check the content.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Kim Do-shik nodded.</span></p><p><span style="">He clicked the button and heard a noise.</span></p><p><i><span style="">-Hello, police officers who are trying to implement justice today.</span></i></p><p><span style="">The voice sounded ridiculous, like the person had inhaled helium gas.</span></p><p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">You have seen my work.</span></i> <i><span style="">If you have the right experts then you will understand how powerful the bomb is.</span></i></p><p><span style="">At the moment, all eyes were focused on the explosive ordnance disposal personnel.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The agent said carefully.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;If the bomb explodes in the city then I think there will be at least a few dozen deaths.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Haha...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Kang-suk pressed the recorder that had been stopped.</span></p><p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">I have prepared a fun game for you.</span></i> <i><span style="">From now on, I will hide nine identical bombs all over the city center.</span></i> <i><span style="">If you can find them all, then it is your win.</span></i> <i><span style="">Of course, you know what will happen if &#xA0;you miss even one.</span></i></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;C-Crazy bastard...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Kang-suk punched the wall.&#xA0;</span><span style="">This wasn&#x2019;t a game to him.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The culprit was literally declaring that they would bomb the city center.&#xA0;</span><span style="">They also sent a bomb to the police like it was a challenge.</span></p><p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">I hope that the courier didn&#x2019;t arrive too late.</span></i> <i><span style="">The first bomb is scheduled at 10 a.m. on December 2nd.</span></i> <i><span style="">The place...</span></i></p><p><span style="">Kim Do-shik shouted.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Fuck! That was four hours ago! Call and ask what the situation is like at Atlantis right now!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">But there was no need to do so.&#xA0;</span><span style="">A person who had been speaking on the radio approached Kim Do-shik with a pale face.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I-Inspector. There was a support request from Gangseo-gu right now&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What? Wait a minute, that is where Atlantis is!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;T-That... A huge explosion occurred at the marine theme park and hundreds of guests were using it...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Kim Do-shik couldn&#x2019;t resist hitting the table with his fists.&#xA0;</span><span style="">As the tape said, one bomb exploded.&#xA0;</span><span style="">But the serious thing was that there were still eight remaining.</span></p><p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">Then I&#x2019;ll give you a hint about where the second bomb is hidden.</span></i> <i><span style="">If you want to give up the game then deposit 15 billion won into the designated account.</span></i> <i><span style="">Then I will tell you the location of all the bombs.</span></i> <i><span style="">Then I wish you luck.</span></i></p><p><span style="">At that moment, the Kangdong Police Station was turned upside down.</span></p><p><span style="">@</span></p><p><span style="">As soon as Tae-hyuk and Ha-yang got out of Atlantis, they headed for a family restaurant in a remote location.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Once there, they had a simple meal and discussed future plans.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Do you know how upset I was? I was really prepared to die.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes, and you almost died. If someone hadn&#x2019;t saved you...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk laughed as he looked at Ha-yang.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Yoo Ha-yang&#x2019;s face and ears turned red.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Uh, anyway. In return for my help, you should tell me everything this time.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">It seemed like she didn&#x2019;t like the fact that he didn&#x2019;t tell her about the fake blueprint.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I have to fool my allies to fool my enemies.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;B-But!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Ha-yang was too embarrassed to speak and wriggled her fingers.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;I am different. It isn&#x2019;t the same.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Aigoo...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk answered with a small sigh.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It seemed the clumsy thief had misunderstood something.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I understand. I will tell you as much as possible.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk took out a notebook and wrote down Kim Tae-sung&#x2019;s name.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;This is the culprit that caused the bombing. A crazy bastard.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Umm. By the way, I was wondering something. How do you know this?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The question emerged.</span></p><p><span style="">He had to tell Ha-yang something to explain all the strangeness.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Tae-hyuk made a sincere expression so she didn&#x2019;t think his words were a joke.</span></p><p><span style="">He raised his hand and said.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;That is because I am a tremendous genius.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;G-Genius?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I have an IQ of more than 200 that surpasses Einstein and with my tremendous sense of reasoning, I can penetrate into the present and the future.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;...The present and the future? Reasoning?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes. Can I open the door of truth? It is simple to analyze human psychology and study the pattern of criminals.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Wah. Amazing. If you have that ability then it is natural to hide it. I&#x2019;m sure that there would be many people who want to use Tae-hyuk.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk shrugged. It was a plausible lie, even to him.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes. So Ha-yang noona should also keep it a secret.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Ha-yang blinked and nodded.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I-I see... Then that is how you know my name?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk pulled out his phone and showed his address book.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I asked you to give me your number and you wrote it down. There was no need for any reasoning.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;...Ah.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Anyway, Yoo Ha-yang. I think it is a name that really suits Noona.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hehehe... Really?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Ha-yang shook her head and started to twirl her fingers with embarrassment.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Only Yoo Ha-yang would be deceived by such an obvious lie.</span></p><p><span style="">&apos;It is a perfect name for Noona, who is a fool.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Either way, I&#x2019;ll go over Kim Tae-sung future movements with you. This isn&#x2019;t the end of his bombs. There are eight more.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;E-Eight?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;And Kim Tae-sung asked for 15 billion won to prevent it. Of course, there isn&#x2019;t an easy amount of money to give. In the end, the police will put a large number of people to find the bomb.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk stopped and thought.</span></p><p><span style="">From now on, the words Ha-yang would hear would be shocking.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Maybe she would betray him and become associates with Kim Tae-sung.</span></p><p><span style="">But according to his previous memories, there was no contact between Yoo Ha-yang and Kim Tae-sung.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It would be Tae-hyuk&#x2019;s fault if they were brought together.&#xA0;</span><span style="">However, Yoo Ha-yang deserved to hear the truth.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;But his purpose is completely different. He doesn&#x2019;t want money nor to kill discriminately.&#x201D; He...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk spoke quietly as he began to describe Kim Tae-sung&#x2019;s purpose.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Then Yoo Ha-yang suddenly burst into tears.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Uhhh, sob... T-Too much... Why did you tell me such things... Aaahhh!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk stroked Ha-yang&#x2019;s back as she started to cry like a child and spoke in a soft voice that seemed to calm Ha-yang down.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I&#x2019;ll ask Noona once again. Do you still want to be my ally?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;...Sob... My cowardice, this situation...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;It&#x2019;s okay. Noona and Kim Tae-sung is different. Noona will never be Kim Tae-sung. If you do then I will stop it.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Did those words move Ha-yang&#x2019;s heart?&#xA0;</span><span style="">Ha-yang slowly nodded at Tae-hyuk&#x2019;s words.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk sighed with relief.&#xA0;</span><span style="">If he hadn&#x2019;t saved Ha-yang&#x2019;s life then she might have betrayed him now.</span></p><p><span style="">Kim Tae-sung&#x2019;s purpose that he told her.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was to kill the chaebol who drove his family to their deaths.</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p>
