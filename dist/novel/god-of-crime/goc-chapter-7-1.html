<p><span style="">Chapter 141 - Everybody Gather! #7</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p><p><span style="">The Bomber&#x2019;s jailbreak!</span></p><p><span style="">He was an atrocious criminal who made bombs with great power designed to commit terrible acts.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was a case that overturned the whole country.&#xA0;</span><span style="">But the problem was what led to the breakout.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Did you sense home?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;......&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Wah? Did you know? I&#x2019;ll tell you the truth. You&#x2019;re returning home in two hours, you really do have a homing instinct.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Yoo Cheol-ho glared at the investigator in charge of questioning him.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Investigator-nim. Let&#x2019;s be honest here since we know each other so well. Give me a pen and I will tell you who the leader that escaped with Kim Tae-sung is, and everything else you want to know.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The investigator clicked his tongue and muttered,</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Is it because you escaped from jail twice? Well, it is good that this will end quickly.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Instead, I have one condition.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;What is it?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Once the investigation is finished, I want to be sent to another prison...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;If you cooperate with the investigation, then I&#x2019;ll see what I can do.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Thus, the whole truth behind the Red Phoenix escape was revealed by Yoo Cheol-ho.&#xA0;</span><span style="">A groan emerged from the mouth of the investigator.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Kuooooh... P-Phantom and the Bomber have joined hands. If the commissioner hears about this, then he will have a headache for a while.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Yes, that&#x2019;s right. This time, I didn&#x2019;t break out because I wanted to. I was forced into it due to Phantom... Doesn&#x2019;t Investigator-nim know about his tricks?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Then the investigator laughed,</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Really? Then this is also fake?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">He pulled out the tape recorder that had Yoo Cheol-ho&#x2019;s voice recorded on it.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Yoo Cheol-ho&#x2019;s eyes trembled as he saw it.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;P-Phantom has the ability to change his face and voice into me...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Really? Then I should discuss it with the warden. Anyway, I won&#x2019;t forget what you told me and will talk to the warden.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">What? Tell the warden?</span></p><p><span style="">Yoo Cheol-ho&#x2019;s face turned white.</span></p><p><span style="">The tape recorder showed that he betrayed the warden.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He would be dead if it entered the warden&#x2019;s ears!</span></p><p><span style="">@</span></p><p><span style="">The newly appointed police commissioner, Chae Bum-ho, was eating in a high class Korean restaurant.&#xA0;</span><span style="">There were delicacies such as abalone, sea bream sashimi, roasted eel, fresh roe, etc. &#xA0;</span><span style="">Even so, Chae Bum-ho&#x2019;s reaction wasn&#x2019;t impressed.</span></p><p><span style="">A man in his 30s with a scary atmosphere was sitting in front of Chae Bum-ho.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes, Mister Park. Did you get the job done?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Mister Park put wasabi on top of the sea bream sashimi and said,</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Don&#x2019;t worry. The evidence that Hyung-nim is related to us has been disposed of.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Really? If that is so... You went through a lot of effort.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Chae Bum-ho&#x2019;s stiff face became much softer.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He grabbed his spoon and started to eat the rice.</span></p><p><span style="">Mister Park finished the sashimi and reached out for the grilled beef.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The charcoal gave it a mouth-watering scent.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;The meat is very soft.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I see. Eat a lot.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ah right, today Hyung-nim is a reborn person who has nothing to do with the Yakuza. Congratulations. Let&#x2019;s have a drink.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Mister Park passed a cup of sake to Chae Bum-ho.</span></p><p><span style="">Their words were dangerous, but there was no need to worry about anyone overhearing.&#xA0;</span><span style="">This was a place where large business executives and high ranking bureaucrats gathered.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Thus, it was very strictly managed.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Secret conversations shared over meals wouldn&#x2019;t be leaked.</span></p><p><span style="">Chae Bum-ho and Mister Park drank the sake and smiled at each other.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;To the newly reborn Hyung-nim!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Chae Bum-ho smiled in satisfaction.</span></p><p><span style="">With this, he could focus on catching Phantom without any worries.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It hadn&#x2019;t been exposed, but the Japanese Yakuza were already deeply embedded in South Korean society.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Then I would like your help with Phantom, as well as in covering up the Taesung Group case.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Kukukuk. Phantom doesn&#x2019;t know how big of a group he has declared war against. Only the tip of the iceberg has been revealed.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Chae Bum-ho was the local police commissioner.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He was credited for finishing a mysterious illness case and was considered a genius at taking opportunities when they arose.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Although the Bomber had run amok, he was now in prison.&#xA0;</span><span style="">That case wouldn&#x2019;t be mentioned again.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Please note that the research is proceeding safely. This is all thanks to Hyung-nim&#x2019;s efforts.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes. This time, pay more attention to managing the staff.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Haha! Don&#x2019;t worry. Sooner or later, I will use this face to enter the political arena. Then we can focus more on the research.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Chae Bum-ho smiled at Mister Park&#x2019;s words.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Then let&#x2019;s talk about Phantom.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Mister Park replied with a smile.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;He is our enemy. What other explanation is needed? The organization will lend its full support.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I heard from Kazuo hyung-nim. Sooner or later, a major Phantom extermination plan will be implemented. What? Working with criminals to catch criminals? I will let him know whose home he is playing in.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The Yakuza and police had a common goal to catch Phantom.</span></p><p><span style="">At that moment, a vibration was heard.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hyung-nim. Is that a message?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;...I told them not to contact me while I was eating.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;There must be an important reason. You can check it out.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Chae Bum-ho looked at the screen of his phone and was at a loss for words.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Hyung-nim?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Mister Park got up and approached Chae Bum-ho, who had become like a stone statue.&#xA0;</span><span style="">What the hell was going on?</span></p><p><span style="">He looked at Chae Bum-ho&#x2019;s phone.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was written that Phantom was the ringleader who broke the Bomber out of Red Phoenix Prison.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hu, huhu, huhuhuhu...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Chae Bum-ho chuckled in a low voice.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Then he muttered in a small voice,</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;You dared touch this area?! Yes, let&#x2019;s do it Phantom. I will take it as a declaration of war. Yes. This is war.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The next day, the police changed their policy from cooperation with Phantom to catching him.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Phantom absolutely had to be arrested.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The police declared a war against the criminal Phantom.</span></p><p><span style="">@</span></p><p><span style="">In secluded rural village deep in the mountains of Gangwon Province was a place that tourists rarely ever visited.</span></p><p><span style="">It boasted only 20 households and even that number was gradually decreasing.&#xA0;</span><span style="">However, there was a sudden boom a few years ago.&#xA0;</span><span style="">A dozen or so robust men came to the area to do farming.</span></p><p><span style="">This was the first time.</span></p><p><span style="">In addition, the crops they brought were far more profitable than the ones previously grown.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was like gold was literally growing from the ground.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was delicious food for worms.</span></p><p><span style="">The village thoroughly restricted access of outsiders.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The advantage was that people couldn&#x2019;t enter the village unless they crossed a long bridge between two cliffs.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Hwang-ssi! I heard that last month&#x2019;s harvest was 2,000?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Huhu, it was 500 more than expected. It is because there was a lot of rain.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;But the crops are also very good this time. If this continues on, then we will be able to harvest more than usual.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Haha. I didn&#x2019;t know that barley would sell for such an expensive price.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The old man said this but he actually knew the truth.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The crops being grown here were drugs.&#xA0;</span><span style="">However, he learned that terrifying fact too late.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The numbers written in the National Agricultural Cooperative Federation (NACF) account was growing and the village was becoming rich.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He could ignore his conscience.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He hadn&#x2019;t been in touch with his family for several years.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The village changing was exciting.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Huhu, I am going out to work in the fields today...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The old people followed behind the young people who came to town.&#xA0;</span><span style="">However, the things they were carrying were strange.&#xA0;</span><span style="">They were holding black rifles, not plows, or sickles.&#xA0;</span><span style="">They were the escorts and watchdogs of the elderly.</span></p><p><span style="">As the elderly people arrived at the fields, they saw something red.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;W-What? T-That!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;The fields are burning!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;F-Fire!!!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">They dropped the farm equipment that they were carrying.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The person holding the steering wheel of the tractor rushed out.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The sight before their eyes was completely different.</span></p><p><span style="">The drug farm was burning like a bomb had gone off.&#xA0;</span><span style="">In the middle was a white mask.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;A-A person?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;H-How can he stand there without burning?!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">As the elderly people stared, the masked person disappeared like the wind.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Only the mask he was wearing remained on the completely burnt fields.</span></p><p><span style="">A man with a gun muttered,</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Phantom...?!&#x201D; (Japanese)</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;P-Phantom...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The monster with the mask disappeared like the wind after blowing away one of the Yakuza&#x2019;s drug farms.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Then the police sirens were belatedly heard in the secluded village.</span></p><p><span style="">@</span></p><p><i><span style="">Tang!</span></i></p><p><span style="">A man in a white suit and black sunglasses struck the table.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;W-What? 10 places have been hit in just a week?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">He was Kazuo Takeshi, the Yakuza member in charge of all of South Korea.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I thought it was easy to manage the farms. What is Mister Park doing?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">He pressed the call button with an agitated face.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Then a familiar voice was heard,</span></p><p><i><span style="">-I&apos;m sorry Hyung-nim.</span></i> <i><span style="">We are doing our best, but we can&#x2019;t even find a shadow...</span></i></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Does that make sense? What is Chae Bum-ho doing?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">-.......</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;A week. If you don&#x2019;t catch that bastard in a week then it won&#x2019;t end with just one finger.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">U-Understood.</span></i></p><p><span style="">Kazuo hung up and muttered,</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;How could one bastard do so much damage?! Damn.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">There was a nameplate reading &#x2018;Park Il-bu, president of the Taesung Industries&#x2019; in front of his seat. (President is lower than chairman).&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was a lower title than what his men called him.&#xA0;</span><span style="">However, he needed to hide his identity as a Yakuza member in South Korea.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;If the supplies are delayed then the research will be delayed, and our wish...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">It was at that moment.&#xA0;</span><span style="">There was a flash, and the office where Kazuo was sitting in was hit with a huge explosion.</span></p><p><i><span style="">Kwa kwa.</span></i></p><p><i><span style="">Kwa kwa kwa kwang!</span></i></p><p><span style="">There was a huge thunder like sound in front of him.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Kazuo died without feeling any pain.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk watched the explosion from 500m away from the Taesung building and lamented.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Ah, the timing was a little wrong.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">He wanted to make a speech before pressing the detonation switch, but he had accidentally blown up the building before he could do so.&#xA0;I</span><span style="">t couldn&#x2019;t be helped.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Ah, I don&apos;t know.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk pointed at the burning building.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Fire!&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">It was a little late but he still felt good.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He had destroyed the enemy&#x2019;s base and their supplies.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The only thing left was to deal with the remaining people.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Now, my turn still isn&#x2019;t over yet.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The Yakuza and police were looking for him at the same time.</span></p><p><span style="">Nevertheless, Phantom&#x2019;s movements were unaffected.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He was always one step ahead.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk thoroughly destroyed the places run by the Yakuza.</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p>
