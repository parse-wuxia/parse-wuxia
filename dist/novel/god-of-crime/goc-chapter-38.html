<p><span style="">Chapter 38 - Aid #2</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk first needed to check the crime scene to know his opponent.</span></p><p><span style=""> &#x2018;The cop... cop...&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style=""> Kang-suk&#x2019;s address book contained almost 800 people.&#xA0;</span>Despite his appearance, Kang-suk was a meticulous person. Therefore, his contacts were organized by category.</p><p><span style=""> &quot;A total of 19 people.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style=""> It was more than he thought.&#xA0;</span>First, he had to find out who was protecting the entrance to the bathroom.</p><p><span style=""> &#x2018;I would be nice if he had a badge with a name on it. Do I need to check them all?&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style=""> Tae-hyuk called the cops in Kang-suk&#x2019;s contacts.</span></p><p><i><span style="">Dururu-</span></i></p><p><i><span style="">-Who is it?</span></i></p><p><span style=""> &quot;Is this Hae-un&#x2019;s phone?&#x201D;</span></p><p><i><span style="">-No.</span></i></p><p><span style=""> &#x201C;Ah... I&#x2019;m really sorry.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style=""> Tae-hyuk repeated the same thing 10 times before he found the right cop.&#xA0;</span>As the phone signal rang, the phone of the cop in front of him started ringing.</p><p><span style=""> &#x2018;He is Kim Jong-wook!&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style=""> Tae-hyuk imitated Cho Kang-suk&#x2019;s voice using Voice Modulation.</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;Kim Jong-wook? It&#x2019;s me, Detective Cho Kang-suk.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style=""> -</span><i><span style="">Eh!</span></i> <i><span style="">Detective Cho Kang-suk!</span></i> <i><span style="">What is going on?</span></i></p><p><span style=""> Tae-hyuk inwardly cheered.</span></p><p><span style=""> &#x2018;Indeed, a cop should know the police officers in charge of this case.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;I think I left my phone behind while investigating the crime scene, can you take a look at the counter?&#x201D;</span></p><p><i><span style="">-Yes, I understand.</span></i> <i><span style="">I will do so straight away!</span></i></p><p><span style=""> Kim Jong-wook followed Cho Kang-suk&#x2019;s instructions and disappeared in the direction of the bathroom.</span></p><p><span style=""> He was holding a flashlight. It looked good from a distance.</span></p><p><span style=""> &#x2018;Then, let&#x2019;s go!&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style=""> Tae-hyuk avoided the cops&#x2019; eyes as much as possible as he stealthily crept up to the crime scene.</span></p><p><span style=""> &apos;By the way, their salaries... What about their pensions?&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style=""> He moved on to thinking about happy things for Ha-ran&#x2019;s future.&#xA0;</span>The bathroom where the murder took place had crime scene tape all around the entrance.</p><p><span style=""> Tae-hyuk laughed.</span></p><p><span style=""> He was wearing a leather jacket and skinny jeans, with an iron pipe in one hand.&#xA0;</span>He had the perfect appearance of a criminal.</p><p><span style=""> Once the &#x2018;Violence&#x2019; skill was activated, his physical abilities increased according to his physical stats.&#xA0;</span>He couldn&#x2019;t help but wonder what would happen.</p><p><span style=""> &quot;Uh, I don&#x2019;t want to be arrested as the criminal right now.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style=""> Despite having little to no knowledge of criminal profiling, Seo Tae-hyuk knew one fact.</span></p><p><span style=""> It was something frequently covered in crime novels and movies: a criminal always goes back to the scene of the crime!&#xA0;</span>This was why the police were stationed at where the second murder took place. Therefore, he had to hide if he didn&#x2019;t want any unusual misunderstandings to take place.</p><p><span style=""> Tae-hyuk looked at the iron pipe that he was holding.</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;Well, hopefully I won&#x2019;t have to use this.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style=""> The body was found was in the women&#x2019;s bathroom.&#xA0;</span>There was a strange atmosphere, due to it being a place where a person had died. The evidence collected by the police left a dust trail.</p><p><span style=""> However, according to the blacklist, there was definitely one thing remaining.</span></p><p><span style=""> The bathroom was empty of water.&#xA0;</span>Instead, the shape of a person crouching down was drawn with a white spray.</p><p><span style=""> Tae-hyuk felt goosebumps as he saw it.&#xA0;</span>Three weeks ago, someone had died in the exact same position as the picture.</p><p><span style=""> Tae-hyuk took out a notebook from his pocket and used the Forgery skill to draw the crime scene as a reference.&#xA0;</span>At that moment, a strange illusion emerged in front of Tae-hyuk&#x2019;s eyes.</p><p><span style=""> &#x201C;Ugh... W-what? Aaaaack!&quot; </span></p><p><span style=""> There was a naked woman with her arms tied behind her back, her body was trapped in a bathtub full of water.&#xA0;</span>Her neck was tied up, and she couldn&#x2019;t move her head. Still, she was able to breathe due to the long tube in her mouth. And the tube...</p><p><span style=""> &#x201C;Heok... Keok!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style=""> Tae-hyuk started breathing roughly. He couldn&#x2019;t even understand what he had just seen.&#xA0;</span>He had just used the Forgery skill, so why did that image appear?</p><p><span style=""> Tae-hyuk pulled out the Demon Revealing Mirror.</span></p><p><span style="">[The Forgery skill has found an intense image.]</span></p><p><span style=""> [The work has been completed through automatic mode.]</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk looked at his notebook, as if he was enchanted by something.</span></p><p><span style=""> There was a picture of a dying woman that had been created by the Forgery skill in less than a minute.&#xA0;</span>The picture was drawn with a pen, and yet it seemed so real.</p><p><span style=""> &quot;Uck...!&quot;</span></p><p><span style=""> At that moment, Tae-hyuk bent over as he felt some nausea.&#xA0;</span>Fortunately, he hadn&#x2019;t eaten dinner yet. He just felt a little sick.</p><p><span style=""> Tae-hyuk knew extrasensory perceptions were similar to this.</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;It was psychometry...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style=""> The ability to see images from objects and places.&#xA0;</span>The Forgery skill was similar to that.</p><p><span style=""> However, he couldn&#x2019;t rejoice.&#xA0;</span>The image of the person dying was intensely burnt into Tae-hyuk&#x2019;s brain. It seemed like the scene would emerge every time he closed his eyes, like a curse.</p><p><span style=""> Tae-hyuk bit his lip.</span></p><p><span style=""> He had come here to confirm if the killer was truly the &#x2018;hippo.&#x2019;&#xA0;</span>It wasn&#x2019;t to see a woman dying.</p><p><span style=""> This had happened almost one month ago, he wouldn&#x2019;t be found right now.</span></p><p><span style=""> &#x2018;... First of all, let&#x2019;s finish up here.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style=""> Tae-hyuk shook his head to forget the scene he just saw.&#xA0;</span>He entered the bathroom. If the killer was truly the hippo, then it had to be here.</p><p><span style=""> Tae-hyuk leaned down towards the floor.&#xA0;</span>He started to carefully search it. Sometimes there was a white powder visible in the water. It was creepy, but he licked it.</p><p><span style=""> &#x201C;This...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style=""> It was salt.</span></p><p><span style=""> No matter how good the police were, it wasn&#x2019;t easy to find it mixed in with the water.</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;The murder tool is salt water...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style=""> Tae-hyuk was reminded of that person.</span></p><p><span style=""> &#x201C;... The hippo.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style=""> Originally, he was a serial killer who would start his activities in three months.&#xA0;</span>He was one of the worst five criminals in Tae-hyuk&#x2019;s blacklist. He had awakened earlier than scheduled.</p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk then had a sudden realization: he was currently the only one in the country who knew the Hippo&#x2019;s identity.</span></p><p>@</p><p><span style=""> Cho Kang-suk looked at his watch with an anxious expression.&#xA0;</span>15 minutes had passed since the promised meeting time.</p><p><span style=""> &quot;This is why punctuality is a problem in Korea!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style=""> He pulled out his phone and checked the message that had arrived 30 minutes ago.</span></p><p><span style=""> -</span><i><span style="">Sunbae.</span></i> <i><span style="">I am leaving now.</span></i> <i><span style="">I&#x2019;ll be there in 10 minutes.</span></i></p><p><span style=""> &quot;That was more than 10 minutes ago.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style=""> Kang-suk finished his lukewarm coffee and went to the counter to get a refill.</span>Thanks to his younger brother, he realized that this cafe was a very good place for meeting people. He had been using it often since then.</p><p><span style=""> Kang-suk took out the envelop that Tae-hyuk gave him as a gift.&#xA0;</span>It was a planetarium admission ticket that was available for one month. On the back was the phone number of a French restaurant with a good atmosphere. It meant to eat here after seeing the stars.</p><p><span style=""> Kang-suk couldn&#x2019;t help laughing after seeing it.</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;Who wouldn&#x2019;t want to go? If only I didn&#x2019;t have to catch this criminal.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style=""> Kang-suk said and put the tickets back in his pocket.</span></p><p><span style=""> Who knows? Maybe the serial killer would suddenly be arrested and he could go out with Ha-ran.</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;There is time left. If I send a message to Ha-ran... But what if I am an annoyance? Ohh...</span></p><p><span style=""> Kang-suk grabbed his head as his body trembled.</span></p><p><span style=""> The other guests at the cafe started looking at him.</span></p><p><span style=""> -</span><i><span style="">Ah, doesn&#x2019;t he look like a gangster?</span></i></p><p><span style=""> -</span><i><span style="">Looking at his phone and then trembling...</span></i> <i><span style="">Don&apos;t tell me?&apos;</span></i></p><p><i><span style="">-Shhh! Be quiet!</span></i> <i><span style="">He will hear!</span></i></p><p><span style=""> Kang-suk laughed. Today, he had come to meet a guest. Therefore, he was wearing a suit that didn&#x2019;t fit him well.&#xA0;</span>He had a large muscular body and was over 180cm tall. He had dark sunglasses. At first glance, it was natural for others to misinterpret his strength.</p><p><span style=""> Then the man sitting near Kang-suk spoke.</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;Excuse me, excuse me... Cho Kang-suk hyung-nim?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style=""> Cho Kang-suk looked at the person.</span></p><p><span style=""> The man was wearing casual attire and had glasses.</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;Who?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;Oh, sorry for introducing myself so late. I am Shin Se-ho, a PD at ABS Station.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style=""> Shin Se-ho pulled out a business card from his wallet.</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;You are a new PD.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style=""> &#x201C;Haha. You don&#x2019;t need to emphasize it. I&#x2019;m familiar with you. Detective Cho is very famous among my colleagues. The detective who caught Yoo Cheol-ho. This meeting was due to chance. Then can I hear the story about that time?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style=""> Cho Kang-suk clicked his tongue. What chance? He knew the PD had been following him for a few days. &#xA0;Shin Se-ho seated himself in front of Cho Kang-suk.</span></p><p><span style=""> Kang-suk knew why the PD was following him.</span></p><p><span style=""> He smelt the hippo case.</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;I&apos;m sorry, but today I came to meet a junior, not to work. If you want an interview then please fill out the official forms.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;Aish, don&#x2019;t be like that. Anyway, I&#x2019;m here as a customer. So I will just drink hot chocolate from the sidelines.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style=""> Kang-suk noticed the microphone in Shin Se-ho&#x2019;s pocket.</span></p><p><span style=""> He suddenly felt fatigued.&#xA0;</span>It was hard to fight crime. Now he had to pay attention to the media as well.</p><p><span style=""> Kang-suk whipped his hand like he was killing a mosquito.</span></p><p><span style=""> He would receive media persecution if he tried to kick the reporter out of here. He needed to be careful.</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;Well, do whatever you want.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style=""> &#x201C;Haha. Yes. I understand.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style=""> Then the door opened and someone entered the cafe.&#xA0;</span>The person was a little taller than Kang-suk, with an intellectual air about him. He was wearing a Rolex watch and an Armani suit. A BMW key was hanging from his fingers.</p><p><span style=""> Cho Kang-suk clicked his tongue. He was wearing at least 20 million won, and had their air of a rich person.</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;Joo Hyun-ho! Over here!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;Uh, Sunbae. Aren&#x2019;t I a little bit late? I&apos;m sorry.&quot;</span></p><p><span style=""> &#x201C;What is a little bit? I refilled my coffee five times while waiting.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;Aish. I was only a few minutes late. There was nowhere to park.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style=""> Joo Hyun-ho smiled and sat down in front of Kang-suk.</span></p><p><span style=""> Joo Hyun-ho had the appearance of a celebrity in a high class suit so the eyes of the females sitting nearby started to light up.</span></p><p><span style=""> They wanted to talk to him but stopped themselves when they saw Kang-suk sitting opposite him.</span></p><p><span style=""> Joo Hyun-ho was a junior from Kang-suk&#x2019;s university days.&#xA0;</span>He majored in criminal psychology and worked in the criminal behaviour analysis team.</p><p><span style=""> The so-called profiler.&#xA0;</span>In this field, he was one of the three most influential profilers in the country.</p><p><span style=""> Kang-suk muttered in a small voice.</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;There is a reporter next to me, so speak softly. I know that you are busy with a lot of cases right now. There is a crime scene that I want you to look at.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;You know that I don&#x2019;t handle straight murders.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style=""> He would only take the cases that attracted his interest.</span></p><p><span style=""> Kang-suk hit him on the head.</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;Hey. This is a mystery that we have no clue about. Be serious. Just listen to me. I didn&#x2019;t want to call you. But he is a completely crazy guy.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style=""> Hyun-ho&#x2019;s eyes shone.</span></p><p><span style=""> He was a man who became a profiler because he liked things like this.</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p>
