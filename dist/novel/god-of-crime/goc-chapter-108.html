<p>Chapter 108: Pieces of the Puzzle #5</p><p></p><hr><p></p><p><span style="">As the amount of sleeping pills decreased, the amount of information that Tae-hyuk gathered increased.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The total amount of drug farms inside the prison numbered seven.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Most of the Chinese inmates confined in Blue Dragon Prison worked there.</span></p><p><span style="">The warden, along with a great number of guards, was involved.&#xA0;</span><span style="">This place was literally a gigantic drug factory.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Come to think about it, there are definitely some strange things.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">Blue Dragon was very active in accepting foreign prisoners.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was very difficult to deal with foreigners who had different cultures and languages, but that didn&#x2019;t mean that there weren&#x2019;t separate benefits.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;There is probably a certain amount of profit from exploiting the labour force.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">He also knew why they mobilized the Chinese inmates.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The country of China had an enormous penalty for drug-related crimes.&#xA0;</span><span style="">China was a country where people were sentenced to death for smuggling drugs without any chance of retrial, regardless of nationality.</span></p><p><span style="">Once, a young woman travelling to China was asked to show her bag at the airport.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Surprisingly, the contents contained drugs.&#xA0;</span><span style="">She was arrested on suspicion of drug smuggling by Chinese police officers who had suddenly appeared.</span></p><p><span style="">In the end, there were many ghost stories about the death penalty.</span></p><p><span style="">&apos;Although they&#x2019;re growing drugs, the Chinese prisoners obviously won&#x2019;t tell anyone unless they&#x2019;re interested in committing suicide. The security is based on fear of their lives. The Chinese criminals are eligible.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">Now Tae-hyuk knew why the warden was acting so strangely in regards to the Park Sung-yul case.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;He didn&#x2019;t want the detectives to find out this information.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">Drugs were being harvested from seven farms.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Obviously, they would use the connections with numerous criminals to trade it.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The warden was trying to prevent it from being exposed, at the expense of Park Sung-yul.</span></p><p><span style="">&apos;His expression at the time meant this.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">The missing pieces of the puzzle were slowly being found, but not all of the problems were completely solved.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;The warden is using the Chinese inmates to grow drugs. What&#x2019;s going on with the Japanese prisoners then?&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">Perhaps there were other crimes besides drug trafficking in the Blue Dragon Prison.&#xA0;</span><span style="">After a few days of searching, Tae-hyuk found the place where the Japanese army buried their gold.&#xA0;</span><span style="">As if it was a joke of fate, the drugs were growing on top of it.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk muttered quietly.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;If I call the police using the name Phantom and uncover the drug farm, the warden can be sent to jail. But what&#x2019;s the fun in that? Besides, I still have two weeks left,so it&#x2019;s best if I can handle both the Park Sung-yul and the drug cases at once.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">He came up with a perfect plan to solve both cases simultaneously.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Anyway, I&#x2019;ll have to talk to Shin Chang-ho.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">@</span></p><p><span style="">It had been almost two weeks since Phantom left for Blue Dragon Prison.</span></p><p><span style="">Kang-suk was organizing the files of the victims killed by Park Sung-yul at the Central Investigation Headquarters.&#xA0;</span><span style="">There were dark circles under the eyes of Joo Hyun-ho, who was sitting opposite of him.</span></p><p><span style="">He was in charge of several additional cases and was unable to leave for a few days.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;There is still no contact from Phantom?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Yes. I would like it if he gives one or two pieces of useful information.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Doesn&#x2019;t he have to get in touch with you first?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes. Then there will be something big later.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hahaha! Big? Sunbae, that word is always associated with Phantom now. Won&#x2019;t there be some big corruption?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Hey! Don&#x2019;t say that!&#x201D;</span></p><p><i><span style="">Dururu-</span></i></p><p><span style="">At that time, Kang-suk&#x2019;s phone on the table started to ring.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Hyun-ho wanted to know who was calling.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Ah, I&apos;m sorry. It&#x2019;s just a little brother I know.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Then Hyun-ho dropped his head and muttered,</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Ahh, Phantom... Why isn&#x2019;t Phantom...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Kang-suk ignored the grouchy Hyun-ho and answered the call.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was a call from Seo Tae-hyuk.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Uh, Tae-hyuk.</span></p><p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">Kang-suk hyung, it&#x2019;s been a while.</span></i></p><p><span style="">&quot;Yeah, have you been studying well?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">Ah, I&#x2019;m studying hard at my&#xA0;one month short-term studying&#xA0;course.</span></i> <i><span style="">Anyways, Noona asked me to tell you that she was thankful for the food last week.</span></i></p><p><span style="">&quot;Ha-ran... She should tell me something like that directly. Um.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Seo Tae-hyuk&#x2019;s sister, Seo Ha-ran, was staying in a dormitory academy on weekdays and only returned home on the weekends.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Unfortunately, both of Ha-ran&#x2019;s younger brothers were away from home.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Kang-suk was uneasy about Ha-ran being left at home alone, so he went and met her every week, bringing along her favorite foods.</span></p><p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">I can feel comfortable about her safety thanks to Hyung.</span></i> <i><span style="">Thank you.</span></i></p><p><span style="">&quot;What is this? I didn&#x2019;t do anything. And thanks to this, I get to have a date with Ha-ran every weekend... Huhu.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">Then please look after her for the last two remaining weeks as well.</span></i></p><p><span style="">&quot;Yes. Study hard and don&#x2019;t worry.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Kang-suk smiled and hung up.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Then Hyun-ho, who was listening to the call, said,</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I guess that is Sister-in-law&#x2019;s younger brother?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Hey! How many times have I said that she isn&#x2019;t your sister-in-law? Hup hup. He is very good at studying, so a foundation sent him to a program abroad. Thanks to him, I have a date with Ha-ran every weekend.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;So that&#x2019;s why you disappear every weekend. Don&#x2019;t you feel sorry for me, who has to work the night shift every weekend?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Okay, I understand. Do you want to go for dinner this evening? At any rate, don&#x2019;t I have to work hard so that my little brother isn&#x2019;t ashamed? We&#x2019;ll have a break at the end. Let&#x2019;s get back to work.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Yes.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Kang-suk scratched his head and turned his attention back to the papers piled on the desk.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;There are so many reports that I have to write. Ah, yes. I have to go to the aquarium this weekend with Ha-ran. Doesn&#x2019;t she like dolphins?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The piled up fatigue disappeared as he imagined her happiness.</span></p><p><span style="">@</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;The next puzzle should be this one.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Park Sung-yul was very happy about his game with Cho Kang-suk.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Even he struggled to solve some of the puzzles created in his head.</span></p><p><span style="">There were still 10 puzzles remaining.&#xA0;</span><span style="">How long could he enjoy this in the future?&#xA0;</span><span style="">Just imagining it caused a smile to form on his face.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It would be interesting to watch the detective be perplexed by his gifts.</span></p><p><span style="">However, the more expensive and delicious the food, the more slowly he needed to eat.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ohuhuhu... Detective, you should be my best rival, like how the Joker is the foil to the Batman.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">These thoughts gave Park Sung-yul the greatest pleasure, and before he knew it, Park Sung-yul realized that he had a strong erection.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It felt like he was the protagonist of a movie.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The thought of being more special than everyone else stimulated him.</span></p><p><span style="">Park Sung-yul realized that he was transformed when killing someone.&#xA0;</span><span style="">But now, the confrontation with Cho Kang-suk was the only way to relive his desires.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Huhuhu... Then I&#x2019;ll give you the best puzzle.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">He smiled and took out the sketchbook kept under his bed.&#xA0;</span><span style="">There was a strange poem that couldn&#x2019;t be easily interpreted.&#xA0;</span><span style="">If he sent this along with the letter, what would be Cho Kang-suk&#x2019;s expression?</span></p><p><span style="">The first puzzle was a tutorial.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The difficulty was easy and it was simple to deduce the elementary school where he went.&#xA0;</span><span style="">But now it was different.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He had spent a month preparing the best puzzle, and it absolutely wouldn&#x2019;t be easy to solve.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Detective Cho Kang-suk... I think about you all day - &#xA0;is this love? If so, I definitely love you. Ohuhu...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Park Sung-yul&#x2019;s twisted affection exploded towards the detective who had caught him.</span></p><p><span style="">@</span></p><p><span style="">Even if only three people gathered together, there had to be a leader among them.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was the same with the inmates in the prison.&#xA0;</span><span style="">If someone asked for the name for the leader of the Korean inmates, everybody would recall the same face.</span></p><p><span style="">Shin Chang-ho, part of one of the three major crime organizations in South Korea, &#x2018;Gallery.&#x2019;&#xA0;</span><span style="">He was a human beast with a stocky, large body, giving him the nickname &#x2018;Brown Bear&#x2019;.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The reason why he was imprisoned despite his power was simple: the boss was in danger of being caught by an enemy&#x2019;s trap.&#xA0;</span><span style="">In return, Shin Chang-ho was promised the number three position in the organization after his release.</span></p><p><span style="">It was already three years ago.&#xA0;</span><span style="">After four years, he would return to the ranks of Gallery.&#xA0;</span><span style="">In Blue Dragon Prison, there were several inmates belonging to Gallery.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He told them that he would be a high ranking official in Gallery after his release.&#xA0;</span><span style="">No one was able to ignore Shin Chang-ho.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Well, I just need to think of it as a long vacation.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Shin Chang-ho made full use of the one hour of exercise time.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It wasn&#x2019;t because he wanted to show off a strong look to the other inmates, it was just that exercising was part of his life.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Around Shin Chang-ho, some criminals from Gallery guarded him with menacing glares.&#xA0;</span><span style="">They were like bodyguards.</span></p><p><span style="">At that time, someone approached Shin Chang-ho.&#xA0;</span><span style="">A bodyguard threatening him with a scary voice,</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Who is approaching?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Shin Chang-ho received a towel from another bodyguard and wiped the sweat from his forehead.</span></p><p><span style="">He confidently looked at the person approaching.&#xA0;</span><span style="">A half shaved head and a rotten face.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was the newcomer who became well-known in the prison in only two weeks.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Tobacco Seller Newbie, what do you want from me? I&#x2019;m sorry, but I don&#x2019;t smoke.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Shin Chang-ho. I have something to suggest to you.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The bodyguards growled at the newcomer,</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;This bastard...! Do you know who you are talking to?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;You guys should know better than me. Shin Chang-ho, 37 years old. The boss of Gallery is known to have raised him, but he is actually from a small orphanage in Seoul.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Then Shin Chang-ho&#x2019;s lips twitched.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Although Tae-hyuk didn&#x2019;t say a lot, only a few people in Gallery knew this information.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;...How did you know?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;The method doesn&apos;t matter. Let&#x2019;s just focus on what we each need.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hoh. It sounds like the newbie has something I want.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Of course. You have a sister that is two years younger than you named is Shin Seo-yeon. Of course, you aren&#x2019;t actually siblings. You were just in the same orphanage. However, once you left the orphanage together, it was like you were brother and sister.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;......!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Shin Chang-ho&#x2019;s eyes widened.&#xA0;</span><span style="">How did the newbie know about Seo-yeon?</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;She hid herself after you went to jail. Don&#x2019;t you want to know where she is now?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Shin Chang-ho glared at the other person for a moment.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;...Newbie. Who the hell are you?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Don&#x2019;t you want to know? Why she had to disappear.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;...I want to know.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Then I will tell you if you give me what I want.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk laughed as he looked at the puzzle piece that could solve both the Park Sung-yul and drug cases at the same time.</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p>
