<p><span style="">Chapter 118 - Prelude to the Mafia Game</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p><p><span style="">&quot;Prison transfer?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Yoo Cheol-ho sat on the bunk bed and looked up at the ceiling with a blank expression.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He looked like a person who just lost his country.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He had planned a successful escape from Blue Dragon Prison, an impregnable fortress.&#xA0;</span><span style="">In preparation for it, he dug a mole tunnel in his cell.&#xA0;</span><span style="">But he wouldn&#x2019;t be able to use it properly before he was transferred.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was enough to drive Yoo Cheol-ho crazy.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk laughed as he listened to Yoo Cheol-ho&#x2019;s groaning.</span></p><p><span style="">&apos;He completely looks like a dead dog.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">For a month, he had used a variety of methods to put Yoo Cheol-ho to sleep, but this was the last time.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Tae-hyuk rustled through his pockets and pulled out a pack of cigarettes.</span></p><p><span style="">Then he heard Yoo Cheol-ho grumbling from the top bunk.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;The guards are now busy being investigated.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Do you want one?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Sheesh. Is this hush money? I&#x2019;ll take it.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Thick arms protruded from the blanket and snatched the cigarette from Tae-hyuk&#x2019;s hand before disappearing.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;You have been easily silenced in the meantime.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;What are you talking about?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Just talking to myself.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk shut up as Yoo Cheol-ho raised the cigarette to his mouth.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was just one cigarette, not a pack.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Huhuhu... I should smell this cigarette for a while.</span></p><p><span style="">Yoo Cheol-ho muttered as he brought the cigarette to his nose.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Then he literally collapsed on the bed.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Tae-hyuk quietly left his bed and looked at Yoo Cheol-ho who collapsed on the top bunk.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He hit Yoo Cheol-ho&#x2019;s cheeks a few times to see if he was really unconscious.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;......&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hrmm. Isn&#x2019;t this effect amazing?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk had turned the sleeping pills into powdered form and put them on the tobacco.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was absorbed in the body by putting it in the mouth or by smelling it.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Eating it would make the affected person fall into a deep sleep within five minutes.&#xA0;</span><span style="">If absorbed through the nasal mucosa, it wasn&#x2019;t uncommon to fall asleep within five seconds.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Then the game will start now. Let&#x2019;s find the gold and perfectly change my destiny.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Blue Dragon Dragon Prison was built on a naval base built during the Japanese colonial period.&#xA0;</span><span style="">No one would imagine that an enormous amount of gold would be buried there.&#xA0;</span><span style="">This fact was discovered by change during the prison renovations.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Of course, the entire amount to the treasury and the reporters had only guessed the amount of money.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;But there will be no construction now.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk had changed the future by creating the prison war.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Then there won&#x2019;t be anyone who discovers it.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Blue Dragon Prion would be shut down in 10 days and would receive a special administration.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Then excavators would be brought in and the would be gold dug up.&#xA0;</span><span style="">If someone tried to block him then he could use the crime skills to take care of them.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;But things are going too well.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Even if the warden was growing drugs and a bomb exploded, did the prison itself have to be removed?&#xA0;</span><span style="">Once he started to question it, there would be many uncertainties.&#xA0;</span><span style="">No, in the first place, the existence of Blue Dragon Prison itself was a strange place.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;...First of all, I should check if the gold is there.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk left his cell and quietly headed for the drug farm where the gold was buried.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The location was a very remote place inside the prison.&#xA0;</span><span style="">At present, most of the guards were under investigation. In the end, the number of patrols could be countered on one hand.</span></p><p><span style="">&apos;But what are those people?&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">In order to get to the drug farm, he had to pass through the area where the Japanese inmates were gathered.&#xA0;</span><span style="">However, even though curfew had passed, a bunch of people were making noises in the corridor.&#xA0;</span><span style="">They weren&#x2019;t guards or investigators.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk hid his body and listened to their conversation.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Oyabun. I didn&#x2019;t think the warden would be caught like this.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Yes. He dared to make a deal with the Chinese.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;But I&#x2019;m glad we were able to obtain it safely. With this, most of the gold left behind by Shogun Takeda will belong to our family.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Huhuhu... There might still be some left, but the situation isn&#x2019;t good. Prepare to withdraw as soon as possible.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hayah!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The unidentified group disappeared into the darkness.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk took a deep breath.</span></p><p><span style="">They already dug up all the gold?&#xA0;</span><span style="">If their words were correct, then he was too late.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Anyway, he noticed that the warden had made a deal with the Chinese as well as the Japanese inmates.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I&#x2019;m not the only one trying to get the gold.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">He needed to check this.</span></p><p><span style="">@</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk changed his destination.&#xA0;</span><span style="">There was nothing to check where the metal was buried.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It wasn&#x2019;t like a treasure chest buried one or two levels down.&#xA0;</span><span style="">There were at least a few hundred kilograms.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was to the extent that one or two people would be able to dig it up all.</span></p><p><span style="">It felt like he acquired one more piece of the puzzle.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The warden, who knew everything, was under investigation.&#xA0;</span><span style="">However, there would certainly be evidence left behind in his office.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Tae-hyuk secretly entered the room.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;...There is definitely something in here.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">He guessed that the warden and the Japanese inmates were doing something.&#xA0;</span><span style="">They were business partners, not prisoners.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He didn&#x2019;t see the deputy who was always guarding the entrance.&#xA0;</span><span style="">If so, he could search without having to worry.</span></p><p><span style="">First of all, he picked up a suitable piece of paper from the table.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Tae-hyuk grasped a pen and triggered a crime skill.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Spying.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Then he drew the structure of the warden&#x2019;s office using Forgery.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hrmm...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">As he guessed, there was a hidden space in the room.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was behind the picture in the corner.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;...He hid it in a place likely to appear in movies.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk clicked his tongue and pulled the picture off the wall.&#xA0;</span><span style="">There didn&#x2019;t seem to be a lot of cleaning, but the picture contained no dust at all.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Let&apos;s see.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">He could see that there was a space behind the wall.&#xA0;</span><span style="">As he pressed an area to open it, a wooden board opened and a safe recessed in the wall was revealed.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Can this be opened with a fingerprint? Eh? It needs the iris as well?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Usually, most safes only contained a dial.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The security on this indicated that something very important was kept here.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The safe was completely sealed with cement so it couldn&#x2019;t be forcibly removed.&#xA0;</span><span style="">In order to check the contents, the owner&#x2019;s fingerprints and eyes were needed.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk licked his lips.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Why are there such cutting edge crime prevention devices in the prison?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The material of the safe was made of a metal alloy that wouldn&#x2019;t break even if a bomb exploded next to it.&#xA0;</span><span style="">If he didn&#x2019;t open the lock, then he would never be able to remove the contents.&#xA0;</span><span style="">But he had already opened the weapons warehouse.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Do it at once. Disguise! Counterfeit!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Once Disguise was activated, Tae-hyuk&#x2019;s face became the warden&#x2019;s.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He used Counterfeit to change the fingerprints on his fingers.&#xA0;</span><span style="">After placing his thumb on the fingerprint reader and his eyes in front of the camera, the safe door opened with a rattling sound.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Apart from the warden, only Tae-hyuk would be able to open this so easily.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Now, let&#x2019;s see what is in here.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The vault contained 10 bundles of $100 bills and a gun loaded with bullets.&#xA0;</span><span style="">There was also a bunch of documents.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Whoa. $100,000? It must be his escape fund. Eh? This...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Once he took out the paperwork, a small envelope fell to the floor.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was filled with white powder.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;...It isn&#x2019;t sugar. Right?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk decided to check the contents of the documents first.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The information contained there was amazing.&#xA0;</span><span style="">In order to operate the drug factory, he bribed various officials and wrote down the details of numerous corruption scandals.&#xA0;</span><span style="">But this wasn&#x2019;t the end.</span></p><p><span style="">Even if the warden had the power of a king, it was only inside the prison.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The warden also made deals with the Chinese and Japanese criminals.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It meant there was a link connecting them.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Mister Park...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk muttered the name of a man who was mentioned several times in the papers.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Mister Park made the drug farm for the warden who wanted to earn big money.&#xA0;</span><span style="">In return, he wanted certain people to infiltrate this place as prisoners.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He also forged all the the necessary documents.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What? If this is real, isn&#x2019;t the warden simply his puppet?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Anyway, the warden seemed to know nothing about the gold.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Mister Park&#x2019;s purpose was clear: Shogun Takeda&apos;s gold.&#xA0;</span><span style="">And according to the man called &#x2018;Oyabun&#x2019;, the plan was already successful.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk took all the items inside the safe and exited.</span></p><p><span style="">@</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hey, Nakada.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk slapped the cheeks of one of the sleeping Japanese inmates.</span></p><p><span style="">Nakada woke up with a small groan.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The Japanese inmates received facilities that were different from other places.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It seemed more like a motel or hotel.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk licked his lips and stared into his opponent&#x2019;s eyes.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Bastard. Who dares interrupt my sleep!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I am a Korean bimbimbap, not Japanese bastard.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Huhu... I&#x2019;ve been in Korea for a year and I don&#x2019;t know...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk smiled and aimed the gun at the other person.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;...Hiik! What?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Good evening. Nakada. I have come to ask you a few things.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;You! Big Brother?!&#x201D; (Japanese)</span></p><p><span style="">Nakada felt wide awake as he stared at Tae-hyuk.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I don&#x2019;t understand what you are trying to say.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Why is the killer from the Triads here! Besides, didn&#x2019;t you die in South Korea?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">It seemed like the other person knew the face of the strongest killer in the Triads.</span></p><p><span style="">&apos;I picked a good disguise.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Tell me what you are doing here. Otherwise, you will become very sick.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I&#x2019;d rather die! I won&#x2019;t betray Oyabun!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Really? Don&#x2019;t the Japanese samurai disembowel themselves when committing suicide? Is it called harakiri? Is it to preserve the Japanese honor?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;......&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk gagged Nakada.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Then he took a knife obtained from the kitchen and placed it against Nakada&#x2019;s belly.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He cut from left to right and his stomach came out.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Do you want to touch it? Being able to touch your internal organs isn&#x2019;t something that just anyone can experience.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Ooooof...!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ah. I don&#x2019;t think I will be able to eat soondae for the rest of my life. Now, Cancel Illegal Surgery.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">Then Nakada&#x2019;s belly returned to normal like time had reversed.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Kuooooh!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Nakada&#x2019;s eyes widened in shock.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Apart from suicide from disembowelment, don&#x2019;t you get your fingers cut off if you make a mistake?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk placed Nakada&#x2019;s palm on the prepared board.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Then he swung the knife.</span></p><p><i><span style="">Kwajik.</span></i></p><p><span style="">Three of Nakada&#x2019;s fingers were cut off and fell to the floor.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Kuoooook!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Nakada couldn&#x2019;t even scream properly.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;But isn&#x2019;t it strange? How are you not hurt at all?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Ooooof!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Nakada desperately stared at Tae-hyuk.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;And voila! Like magic! Your cut off fingers are now restored!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;......&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Nakada felt like he was possessed.&#xA0;</span><span style="">A dead killer was smiling in front of him.&#xA0;</span><span style="">His guts had spilled out, only to go back inside.&#xA0;</span><span style="">His fingers were cut off and then put back on again.&#xA0;</span><span style="">How the hell could he dispel this?</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;There is one way for this to be possible. The correct answer...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;......&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;...All of this is a dream.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk laughed and took off Nakada&#x2019;s gag.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He continued speaking.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Think about it. It is strange. I am clearly dead. Isn&#x2019;t that right? Yet here I am torturing you. This is a dream.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Dream?&#x2019; (Japanese).</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes. It isn&#x2019;t real. So why do you have to remain loyal in a dream?&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Yes, definitely...&#x201D; (Japanese)</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Why don&#x2019;t you tell me? What are you doing here?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;That...&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Nakada hesitated for a moment before slowly opening his mouth.</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p>
