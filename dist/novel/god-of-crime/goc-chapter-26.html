<p><span style="">Chapter 26: Power Deployment #3</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p><p><span style="">For the next day and the day after, Tae-hyuk could feel someone&#x2019;s gaze while he was working in the art room.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk showed an irritated expression as he wiped off the moisture from his brush.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Ah, it is like having a pebble in my sneakers.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">While he could ignore it, it was still annoying and constantly jarring.</span></p><p><span style="">He remembered the saying of a person in a marathon who was eliminated just before the finish line.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;The hardest part of the race wasn&#x2019;t the other people pressuring him from behind, but the small piece of sand in his shoes.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">That was Tae-hyuk&#x2019;s state right now.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He had four crime skills, but he didn&#x2019;t have the skill to detect another person.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Who the hell is it?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">He couldn&#x2019;t bear it and finally shouted.</span></p><p><span style="">The door of the art room opened like there was a reaction.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Who&#x2019;s in here?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">A schoolgirl with short hair that exposed her ears entered.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk was filled with embarrassment.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He was illegally occupying the art room. He felt sorry.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ahaha... Hello. I was just painting.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The schoolgirl came in and examined him.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Are you in the art department? I know that the art department was closed due to a lack of resources.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I&#x2019;m just a student who is interested in painting.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk smiled as innocently as possible. This was a workshop that he was barely able to find, so he didn&#x2019;t want to be kicked out of here.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I see. I&#x2019;m actually retired, but I was also in the art department. Are you in the first grade?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I&#x2019;m in the second grade.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;It is the first time I&#x2019;ve seen you...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk gave his pre-prepared excuse.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Ah, I just transferred this week.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;A transfer student! I am Lee Hana. If you are interested in the art department, then I will let you know the name of the teacher who is the adviser.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Haha... I will think about it. Oh right, my name is Lee Cheol-su.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk gave her a pseudonym.</span></p><p><span style="">He met someone a few days after starting to work here.</span></p><p><span style="">He didn&#x2019;t want to advertise that he wasn&#x2019;t a student at this school.</span></p><p><span style="">Lee Hana approached Tae-hyuk, then she laughed softly as she said,</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Can I see what you are doing?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes. Here.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Lee Hana looked at the painting that Tae-hyuk copied. Her face was filled with surprise.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Wah! Wah... Did you really paint this?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I am practicing drawing by copying art.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;It&apos;s really great! Have you ever gone to art school? I will go to the adviser immediately. We need such a talent in the art department!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Lee Hana spoke excitedly.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk was silent for a moment. He had just copied the original with a skill, so it was strange to hear such praise.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I-It isn&#x2019;t that great. I merely copied the brushstrokes.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Don&#x2019;t be shy! Well, if I look closer, then I can see that there are definitely a few missing details.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Lee Hana squinted at Tae-hyuk&#x2019;s painting again.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Is it not enough?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;This figure is drawn with a simple technique, so you can never perfectly copy the original. It is withdrawn? Do you understand the difference between this painting and a withdrawn work?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk shook his head. </span><span style="">He was just a high school student who could use crime skills, and didn&#x2019;t have a profound knowledge on art.</span></p><p><span style="">Lee Hana laughed like she was glad to discover a new talent.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;While your painting doesn&#x2019;t have a soul, you have great technique. You literally copied the painting that you saw, but you won&#x2019;t be able to move the heart of the person who painted it.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Soul?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes. Do you know what type of heart this painting was drawn with?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Lee Hana pointed to the original painting that Tae-hyuk had copied.</span></p><p><span style="">It was a landscape painting that depicted a forest where the falling rain had stopped, and a beam of light was shining through the clouds.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk replied honestly.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;A wonderful landscape. It feels like a living forest.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Doesn&#x2019;t it? The rain has stopped, and the forest is full of life. It is a place that I really like. When I die, I would like to die in a place like this. Everything felt so vivid when I was painting it. I was so grateful to be alive.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Suddenly, Tae-hyuk discovered a strange fact in Lee Hana&#x2019;s words.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Uh, then Sunbae painted this?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Omo, did you only just find out? It is something that I painted in my first year.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I only used it as a reference because I thought it was the best painting here. I didn&#x2019;t know that it was Sunbae&#x2019;s.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ahaha. At any rate, bend the brush. I&#x2019;ll tell you about the brush strokes.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">From then on, Lee Hana&#x2019;s drawing lesson began.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk focused on her words, ignoring the notifications from the Demon Revealing Mirror.</span></p><p><span style="">He could guess what the contents were.</span></p><p><span style="">While his skill was enough to copy the artwork, he learned that it was also important to read the heart of the picture.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ah. It is already this time... I&#x2019;ll have to end here today. Think about what you have learned today, and you will know why the painting was drawn.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Lee Hana gently winked.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk used the moment to quickly glance at the Demon Revealing Mirror, where numerous messages had appeared.</span></p><p><span style="">[Your understanding of art has deepened.]</span></p><p><span style="">[The Forgery skill proficiency has increased by a lot!]</span></p><p><span style="">[More sophisticated work is now possible.]</span></p><p><span style="">After checking the skill, his proficiency level had gone up by around 20 points. </span><span style="">He couldn&#x2019;t miss this good chance.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk asked with a puppy-like expression.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Thank you, Hana sunbae. Can I see you again next time?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ahaha! I&apos;m a busy person. Well, it does feel good.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Hana laughed like she enjoyed it.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk was startled.</span></p><p><span style="">All of a sudden, he felt that Lee Hana&#x2019;s face was familiar.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Wait. Surely she isn&#x2019;t that Lee Hana?&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">She reminded him of someone.&#xA0;</span><span style="">She was a genius female painter who became so famous that she held a solo exhibition in Paris in her early 20s.</span></p><p><span style="">&apos;It is obviously the same name. She was primarily a landscape illustrator. Eh...? Don&apos;t tell me?&apos;</span></p><p><span style="">She was famous for the dreamlike atmosphere of her paintings.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Wait. Then I was copying the painting of a person like that?&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">He felt strange all of a sudden, as he never imagined that a celebrity would be so close.</span></p><p><span style="">It had only been a few days since Tae-hyuk first held a paintbrush.&#xA0;</span><span style="">But now he had a discussion about painting with a genius painter.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was like practicing dribbling in front of Messi.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;I heard that she went straight to Europe after graduating from high school. I guess that is the reason why she seems to be so strangely relaxed for a third year in high school.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk looked at Lee Hana, and suddenly felt like there was a subtle halo around her.</span></p><p><span style="">Lee Hana waved her hand as she turned around to leave.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Wahahat ~ ah, that&#x2019;s right. There are rumours that a stalker is wandering around the school. Have you ever seen someone suspicious lately?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Stalker?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes. They say he is a voyeur.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I haven&#x2019;t seen anyone suspicious.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk replied with a face that made it seem like he didn&#x2019;t know anything. </span></p><p><span style="">In fact, he was the most suspicious person in this school.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;If you find something then please tell me. If the incident becomes bigger and the police comes, then this place might be closed down.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;This would be difficult.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Right? I think so as well! Hahat!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Lee Hana laughed and exited.</span></p><p></p><p style="text-align: center"><span style="">* &#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;* &#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;*</span></p><p></p><p><span style="">After Tae-hyuk was sure that she was gone, his smile disappeared.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Stalker or a voyeur.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Lee Hana spoke calmly but he got the impression that she was nervous.</span></p><p><span style="">Of course, he had never seen such a person.&#xA0;</span><span style="">But he had some ideas.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Then, the eyes looking at me...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The mystery was unravelled.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk searched the art room, and noticed several hidden cameras that were installed throughout.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ohuhuhu. I got the bastard!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">This was what had been missing.</span></p><p><span style="">He discovered traces of the crime, and received a message about a new skill.</span></p><p><span style="">[Crime Skill: X-ray Vision has been learnt.]</span></p><p><span style="">- You can see through things (this doesn&#x2019;t apply to creatures).</span></p><p><span style="">-The criteria to fully learn it has yet to be met.</span></p><p><span style="">-A skill has already been registered in the temporary skill window.</span></p><p><span style="">If you are register a new skill, then the existing skill will disappear.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk almost screamed at that moment.</span></p><p><span style="">X-ray Vision!&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was literally a man&#x2019;s romance.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Crazy, my heart!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">He cried out.</span></p><p><span style="">It was impossible to make a living with X-ray Vision.</span></p><p><span style="">However, that&#x2019;s why it was better.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He could literally see through the clothes that people were wearing.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Ohu, ohuhuhu, ohahahahat!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The feature was so perfect that Tae-hyuk felt like crying.</span></p><p><span style="">He then recalled the last messages on the Demon Revealing Mirror.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Wait a minute. There is something strange.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">He was so excited about the X-ray Vision skill that he hadn&#x2019;t properly read the rest of the message.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Tae-hyuk felt anxious and confirmed it in the Demon Revealing Mirror.&#xA0;</span><span style="">His face fell like a dog that had been neutered.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;... I have to give up Forgery to learn X-ray Vision?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">It was the limit of temporary registration. The skill was temporary, so if he learned a new one, the existing skill would disappear.</span></p><p><span style="">He would miss the opportunity to learn it forever.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Ugh, no! Then, is it asking me to choose between X-ray Vision and Forgery?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">It was like choosing between jajangmyeon and jjampong.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was a fateful decision.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk bit his lip. X-ray Vision was a skill that couldn&#x2019;t be abandoned. But Forgery...</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Ugh, damn! What is this?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk&#x2019;s hands hovered over X-ray Vision, which he had always desired.</span></p><p><span style="">He then stabbed his thigh with a sharp brush tip.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He felt as if his spirit had come back due to the shock.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Goodbye, my pink life...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">He couldn&#x2019;t give up Forgery that had over 50 proficiency points.</span></p><p><span style="">Eventually, Tae-hyuk tearfully abandoned the X-ray Vision skill.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Tae-hyuk sat in the chair for a while with a sense of emptiness.</span></p><p><span style="">Then he muttered.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Even though I didn&#x2019;t get it... I will catch the strange voyeur.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">There were rumours of a voyeur. </span></p><p><span style="">Maybe he wasn&#x2019;t enjoying it alone, but was spreading it on the Internet.</span></p><p><span style="">If the incident became bigger, then the police would be dispatched, which would result in an almost 100% chance of this place being closed down.&#xA0;</span><span style="">They would search through everything to collect evidence.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk had only just found this workshop. Besides, he was able to raise his proficiency at a high speed due to Lee Hana.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He was unable to abandon this place. </span></p><p><span style="">For one thing, he would never do anything completely selfless.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk put away his brushes and paints and stood up.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He set up a trap to catch the enemy.</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p>
