<p><span style="">Chapter 157 - Seo Ha-ran&#x2019;s Wish #1</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p><p><span style="">In the end, the Bomber got his revenge, at the expense of his life.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Tae-hyuk felt regret.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Aigoo. There aren&#x2019;t a lot of bombs left in the inventory, so if you die like this...&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">If he had known this, it would&#x2019;ve been better to learn the skill &#x2018;Bomb Manufacturing&#x2019; by disposing of the Bomber directly.</span></p><p><span style="">The aftermath of his death was enormous.</span></p><p><span style="">A few years ago, the researchers at Taesung Chemicals&#x2019; research institute caused a virus to mutate and an incident to occur.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Since then, the institute had been closed and all projects had been frozen indefinitely.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Yet they continued working on it in an underground facility?</span></p><p><span style="">It was a great event that brought tremendous repercussions.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Unfortunately, the fearsome substance called Psychotropic Incense all burned up.&#xA0;</span><span style="">However, the media loved conspiracy theories and snapped it up like rice cakes.</span></p><p><span style="">Furthermore, all the dirty work done on behalf of the Yakuza were revealed.&#xA0;</span><span style="">From the position of the Taesung Group, it was pouring oil on a house that was already on fire.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk used his smartphone to access the Internet.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Most of the news were related to the Taesung Group.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;In the first place, the Taesung Group was a company with a ridiculous amount of influence.</span></p><p><span style="">It would be within the top 10 of all the big companies.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Once someone went abroad, they would be able to know the scale of the company.&#xA0;</span><span style="">However, Mister Park had been able to control the media until now.</span></p><p><span style="">Mister Park became his identical twin brother and entered the political circle.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;After 10 years, did the company climb up to seventh place?&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">Thanks to the sacrifice of the Bomber, that future would never happen.&#xA0;</span><span style="">This meant...</span></p><p><span style="">The cause of Tae-hyuk going to jail had vanished.</span></p><p><span style="">&apos;Since Mister Park died, there is no one else to act as Park Jung-hwan. Furthermore, the Taesung Group can now barely take care of itself. Then the Yakuza controlling everything from behind...&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">Along with the Chinese Triads and the Russian Red Mafia, they were walking around with a chain around their necks.</span></p><p><span style="">It was the butterfly effect.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The theory that a butterfly&#x2019;s wings flapping could cause a hurricane on the other side of the earth.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk changed his and many others&#x2019; fates by using his knowledge of the future.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Every time he received a reward, it was like he got another piece of the puzzle.&#xA0;</span><span style="">In the end, a great picture was formed.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He had overturned the table so thoroughly that even the butterfly effect couldn&#x2019;t occur anymore.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk looked at the Demon Revealing Mirror with a satisfied expression.&#xA0;</span><span style="">There was a message to find out about the God of Crime.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Nothing had been revealed yet about the conditions required.</span></p><p><span style="">However, there was no need to rush.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It had been one year since he had first obtained the Demon Revealing Mirror and his crime skills.&#xA0;</span><span style="">In the end, he was able to win the fight against fate.</span></p><p><span style="">First of all, he decided to relax and enjoy this.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;By the way, I think I am forgetting something very important. What was it?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk scratched his head and wondered.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Then something suddenly popped into his head.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;...Ah, Noona&#x2019;s wedding gift!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">He had been busy for a while, thanks to the mafia game and the Bomber&#x2019;s revenge.&#xA0;</span><span style="">In the meantime, Seo Ha-ran&#x2019;s wedding was imminent.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;What would be good...?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk was deep in thought.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;...In the end, it is a house.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The place where they were living now was like a mansion compared to their previous rented room.&#xA0;</span><span style="">However, Kang-suk was taking care of children.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Tae-hyuk recalled that Ha-ran wanted to live in a two-storey house with a garden.</span></p><p><span style="">After Kang-suk and Ha-ran got married, Tae-hyuk and Tae-min agreed to live with them until they graduated from university.&#xA0;</span><span style="">There would be six people living together so a large house was needed.</span></p><p><span style="">Anyway, it was okay if the house was in the suburbs because Kang-suk had bought a car recently.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Well, how much money do I have now?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">He decided to check the balances of his various accounts.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He had collected a significant amount of money while working as Phantom.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It increased greatly after the mafia game.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;...4.07 billion?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Winning the normal lottery gave a jackpot of 500 million won.&#xA0;</span><span style="">In one year, the amount he earned was like winning the lottery several times.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk laughed.</span></p><p><span style="">First, he would be able to buy a house for his family for one billion won.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He decided to go to a real estate agent in the suburbs.</span></p><p><span style="">@</span></p><p><span style="">There were smartphone apps that allowed him to search for businesses that specialized in certain things, such as apartments or housing.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He finally decided on a single family home and started wondering what to wear.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;This is the house that I am going to live in so why should I change myself?&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk wore his usual clothes and went to visit the real estate agent.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The agent in his 50s was watching TV with a sleepy expression.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Welcome. Have you come to see the house?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">The agent studied Tae-hyuk before making a listless expression.</span></p><p><span style="">At best, he was a freshman who just entered university.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He was wearing a leather jacket and his hair wasn&#x2019;t even trimmed properly.&#xA0;</span><span style="">His body was wet with sweat, like he had been running.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Maybe he came to look for a room.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Ah, yes. I wanted to look at what was on sale.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hrmm. I&#x2019;m sorry but I don&#x2019;t think we have any guest rooms suitable for you. The cheapest one is an officetel that requires a basic security deposit of three million and monthly rent is 1.2 million.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">His words meant to leave now.&#xA0;</span><span style="">However, Tae-hyuk shook his head and said,</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I came to see about buying a place, not renting.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;B-Buying?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I was wondering if there was a suitable single family home. There should be a lot of rooms. It doesn&#x2019;t matter if it is new or not But there should be a small garden.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ha, ha, ha... Guest-nim... You seem to be mistaken about something. Such a house is at least one billion won...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I have that much.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Huh?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The agent&#x2019;s eyes widened.&#xA0;</span><span style="">This guy had one billion won?&#xA0;</span><span style="">The agent turned red and he thought about calling the police.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Are you joking right now? This is obstructing my business...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk&#x2019;s eyes narrowed as he watched the agent.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It seemed like he would have to take out his bankbook and show his balance for things to go smoothly.</span></p><p><span style="">It was at that moment.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Two guests entered through the half open door.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was a young woman with colourful makeup and a man who seemed to be in his late 40s.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The two of them were stuck close together like they were dating.</span></p><p><span style="">No matter how he looked, it seemed like an affair.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The atmosphere of the agent changed as the couple entered.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Oh, Boss-nim is here! I have found a house that fits your requirements.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The middle-aged man chuckled and replied,</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Really? Is it was two-storey house with lots of rooms and a yard? I thought I would buy one due to the redevelopment happening nearby. We need a house to live in.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">A fresh smile appeared on the agent&#x2019;s face.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The real estate agent would receive a percentage of the sales price as a commission fee.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Selling a house was much better than renting one.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Please sit here and look at the catalogue. I&#x2019;ll go and get you some tea.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The middle-aged man started talking business with the agent.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;It is cheaper than the market price in a nearby area. In this location, a house for one billion won is cheap.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Coincidentally, the house he was looking for had the same specs that Tae-hyuk was interested in.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Tae-hyuk&#x2019;s eyes narrowed as he stared at the couple.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;If you want to live, then get out quickly.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">However, the couple ignored him.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hrmm... It seems a bit more expensive than I thought....&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What, Oppa. Buy me a house~&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;No, not that one. The price is a little...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">It seemed like the price was a little expensive just for an affair.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The two people started to argue for a while.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Argh! Annoying! By the way, who is the person who keeps looking at us?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;That reminds me, he was here from the beginning.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Then the agent said with embarrassment,</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ah, no. I&#x2019;ll get rid of him straight away.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The agent approached Tae-hyuk and waved his hand like he was shooing away a fly.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I have an important deal to take care of, so please come see me about the house next time.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk made an absurd expression.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The house that the couple was buying.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Tae-hyuk had enough money to buy two or three of them if he wanted, yet he was being treated as a troublesome fly?</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What? That person came to see you about a house?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ah, yes. It seems like he wants to buy a small house.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Haha! Is it a rooftop house? By the way, I truly don&#x2019;t know how people can live in that. I would die if I needed to live in a rooftop house. Huh? Right Oppa?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Okay, okay. Oppa believes you.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;......&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">All expression disappeared from Tae-hyuk&#x2019;s face as he listened to the conversation between the couple and the agent.&#xA0;</span><span style="">His family had lived in a rented semi-basement room for years.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Well... What a disagreeable couple. Should I just take them out quietly? Then I will buy that property. It is a good idea.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">He touched the Tokarev TT-33 pistol that was hidden on his body.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He had obtained it from the mafia members who attacked Caterina.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It had been really useful in the meantime.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk heard the whisperings of the couple.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;But are we going to live in the same neighbourhood as a person like that? It is disgusting...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Aish, surely not. This is an expensive area. Don&#x2019;t worry.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">His grip on the gun tightened.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He instantly started planning the crime in his head.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The opponents knew his face.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Therefore, he needed to get rid of everyone here. &#xA0;</span><span style="">After all, the dead couldn&#x2019;t talk.&#xA0;</span><span style="">This place had CCTV but it wasn&#x2019;t on an external server.&#xA0;</span><span style="">If he knew the exact location then it wouldn&#x2019;t be that difficult...</span></p><p><i><span style="">-The most important thing that Mother left isn&#x2019;t this Rosario.&#x201D;</span></i></p><p><i><span style="">Pajik!</span></i></p><p><span style="">At that moment, he felt like something was breaking on his face and there was a strange pain.</span></p><p><span style="">His wildly beating heart calmed down.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Eh? I thought I heard something strange just now. Was I mistaken? Um... Didn&#x2019;t I come here for Noona&#x2019;s gift? There is no need to do such annoying things. First, let me ask what gift Noona would like to receive. Then I can buy them a house if it isn&#x2019;t enough.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk let go of the pistol and quietly left the rest estate business.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The couple looked after him and muttered,</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Aigoo. An empty-headed fellow like that. Boss-nim. Don&#x2019;t rent a house to someone like that in this neighbourhood. It will bring the quality down.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Haha, of course. Anyway, I doubt he would have the ability to obtain any of the properties. He will probably go to the slums.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Don&#x2019;t you think the quality of the person living there is important to increase the value of the house? Then let&#x2019;s go see this property.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes. Oppa, let&#x2019;s go see the room.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ah, yep! I will go start the car. Boss-nim, please be at ease.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The agent and couple laughed happily without realizing that they had almost died.</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p>
