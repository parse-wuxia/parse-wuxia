<p><span style="">Chapter 134 - Traces of the Mask #4</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p><p><span style="">Anne bit her lip as she recalled what she had just seen.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was an unbelievable sight.</span></p><p><span style="">Caterina had once mobilized an elite crew for an assassination.&#xA0;</span><span style="">They were those who could fight against the soldiers of other countries.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">However, a similar number was now wiped out by only one person.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He was also only armed with a submachine gun and a pistol.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The mafia members had an anti-tank rocket and sniper rifles that boasted a range of 1000m.</span></p><p><span style="">Phantom alone had taken out 30 people.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was a difference that she thought couldn&#x2019;t be overcome.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Phantom had fired his gun without even aiming.&#xA0;</span><span style="">However, the result was amazing.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The RPG-7 exploded, and the sniper with the PSG-1 had his head explode.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;T-This is ridiculous. How can you snipe a sniper with a submachine gun?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Phantom scratched his head as Anne made a fuss.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was a feat that was possible due to the Shooting Spree skill.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He had no answer for how he did it.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I just did it?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;......&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Anne&#x2019;s answer was a low moan.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Then her butler appeared behind her.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was Semon who had gone around the battlefield to see if there was any more danger.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Young Lady. The enemy has been wiped out, even the snipers waiting at a distance.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">There were more snipers than the one that Anne saw.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Anne looked at the man wearing the opera mask.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He didn&#x2019;t have any wounds despite dealing with so many people alone.</span></p><p><span style="">Rather, he seemed hungry as he watched his work.</span></p><p><span style="">Anne nodded a few times, like she had made up her mind, before speaking.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Phantom...I followed the traces of the mask. As I said, I was going to use you to deal with the Yakuza and the Triads. Of course, I am going to pay you for your abilities.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Well, don&#x2019;t you know me very well despite just meeting today?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Anne laughed at his words.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I have more spies in the police than just art appraisers. I can&#x2019;t tell you their identities, but I was able to learn about you through them.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;What, there are more spies in the police? Aigoo. There might even be spies among Mister Park&#x2019;s group.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I won&#x2019;t deny it. At any rate, your abilities are more than what Mister said. I honestly wouldn&#x2019;t have believed it if I didn&#x2019;t see it with my own eyes.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">It was because he had just gotten the Shooting Spree skill.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Phantom smirked.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was a fact that his crime skills were still growing.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Once today&#x2019;s incident reaches the ears of the Yakuza or the Triads, they will try to set you on fire. Originally, I intended to promise you the boss seat of the Korean branch. But any other organization can offer that, so I can only offer one more thing.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Anne looked at the Phantom with a slightly red face.</span></p><p><span style="">The person behind the opera mask was definitely a man.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Among the Red Mafia, the Yakuza, and the Triads, she was the only female boss.&#xA0;</span><span style="">That&#x2019;s why only she could offer this.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I will give you all of the Red Mafia. Could you please marry me?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;...Wait. Is that a proposal?!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The other person was the boss of the Ivankov family.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He knew what it meant to marry her.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It wasn&#x2019;t just the boss of South Korea, but ruling over all of the Red Mafia.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Fortunately, I am still in my 20s and still haven&#x2019;t been married. In addition, I think I am fairly beautiful.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;20s...?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Yes, I am 29.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;......&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Phantom...</span></p><p><span style="">No, Tae-hyuk gulped.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Although he tried to be as calm as possible, he was several times more nervous than when he was fighting the mafia.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He never thought he would receive a proposal from a woman more than 10 years older than him.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;I thought she was around the same age as Noona, but she is five years older?!&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">She was beautiful enough to become a model right now.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Furthermore, she would bring along the Red Mafia.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;If your answer is a yes, can you take off the mask?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">At that moment, Tae-hyuk&#x2019;s spirit recovered.</span></p><p><span style="">Anne proposed to Phantom, not Seo Tae-hyuk.&#xA0;</span><span style="">In order to protect his precious ones, this line couldn&#x2019;t be crossed no matter what.</span></p><p><span style="">As Phantom seemed to hesitate, Anne moved closer.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Perhaps you already have someone in mind? First place is good, but I can be satisfied with being the second.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Cough. That isn&#x2019;t the problem. And I&apos;m sorry, but can you back away a little bit?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Do you not like me?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">It wasn&#x2019;t unpleasant to marry a beauty like Anne.&#xA0;</span><span style="">However, problems would arise after accepting.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;At any rate, I will accept half of Anne&#x2019;s offer. First, I will deal with the Yakuza and the Triads. However, I will be doing it by myself, and will not be working with the Red Mafia. Of course, I&#x2019;ll be happy if you provide weapons.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hrmm... then are you rejecting my proposal? My appearance...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;No, don&#x2019;t you think it is too fast to marry someone after only meeting them for one day?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Anne clapped in pleasure.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Then it isn&#x2019;t a refusal? Shall we date first? It is okay if you don&#x2019;t want to show my your face. It is like a real phantom so I don&#x2019;t think it is bad.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk couldn&#x2019;t help sighing.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It seemed like the number of females around him who gave him headaches had increased.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;First of all, let&apos;s leave this place. The police will soon come swarming.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;My car... Oh my. The anti-tank rocket destroyed it.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">It was probably to prevent any escape.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Tae-hyuk scratched his head and replied,</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I already stole cash from the mafia. Let&#x2019;s try Vehicle Theft.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">As Tae-hyuk touched it, the truck started up without the car keys.</span></p><p><span style="">Anne clapped in amazement.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It seemed like she wouldn&#x2019;t have to worry about catching a taxi on the honeymoon.</span></p><p><span style="">@</span></p><p><span style="">Shin Se-ho, the chief of ABS Broadcasting, opened his eyes as a familiar voice was heard over the phone.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;...P-Phantom!&#x201D;</span></p><p><i><span style="">-It has been a while.</span></i> <i><span style="">Have you recovered from your injuries?</span></i></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ha, ha, ha! Yes, of course. Thank you for saving my life. I thought you forgot our promise because you haven&#x2019;t contacted me in a while.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Shin Se-ho had a deal with Phantom.&#xA0;</span><span style="">If he wanted to broadcast something then he would release it only through Shin Se-ho.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Shin Se-ho was an ambitious person and didn&#x2019;t miss the opportunity that Phantom gave him.&#xA0;</span><span style="">In the end, he was promoted from being a PD at ABS.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Since then, he acted like he was Phantom&#x2019;s good friend.</span></p><p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">I&#x2019;ve been away for a while now, so I think I need a big hit.</span></i></p><p><span style="">Shin Se-ho&#x2019;s hands shook.</span></p><p><span style="">Just Phantom alone would cause the audience ratings to skyrocket.</span></p><p><span style="">But a big hit?&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was a word that Phantom never said despite several broadcasts.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;T-Thank you. I&#x2019;m sorry but can you give me a quick hint? I would like it to be a dramatic story like the organ trafficking...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">A laugh was heard from the phone.</span></p><p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">Did you know that China&#x2019;s Triads were behind that situation?</span></i></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;O-Of course. Due to that, fan clubs were created for Phantom. Then this story...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Destroying the Chinese criminals that the police couldn&#x2019;t catch.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The public was enthusiastic about the appearance of the criminal who judges criminals.&#xA0;</span><span style="">But what about it?</span></p><p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">A few days ago, I was bored and smashed a cult.</span></i></p><p><span style="">He knew about that.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ah! Are you talking about the Sun group? The scoop was sent to our station. That was Phantom&#x2019;s work?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">Yes.</span></i> <i><span style="">By the way, the Japanese Yakuza were involved.</span></i></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ah...is that so?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Shin Se-ho&#x2019;s eyes shone.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He had his scoop for the evening.</span></p><p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">The Triads and the Yakuza.</span></i> <i><span style="">Do they think that they could act as they like in South Korea?</span></i> <i><span style="">So I thought I would give them a warning.</span></i></p><p><span style="">&quot;......!&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">In other words, he was talking about war.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was a big hit since he was targeting criminal organizations from other countries that were active in Korea.</span></p><p><span style="">H-H-Huge scoop.</span></p><p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">Of course, I&#x2019;m sure that you will do well, but I want to specifically direct this.</span></i> <i><span style="">And make sure the video is registered on the UCC site so that people around the world can see it.</span></i> <i><span style="">ABS Station can have the advertising fees as long as it is spread as much as possible.</span></i> <i><span style="">How about it?</span></i></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;O-Of course.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Phantom had only done four broadcasts, but they had earned billions of won worth of advertising revenue.&#xA0;</span><span style="">But the scale this time was completely different.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Phantom had declared war.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The contents were provocative enough to get the public excited.</span></p><p><span style="">It would be tens of billions of won.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Even if he only took 10% of this...</span></p><p><span style="">Shin Se-ho mind thought of a foreign car that he had been noticed for ages.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was more than 250 million, so he had been hesitating.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Now it wouldn&#x2019;t be hard to buy it with a lump sum.</span></p><p><span style="">@</span></p><p><span style="">The screen slowly brightened and showed the terrible scene of the &#x2018;Doll Play&#x2019; incident caused by the Chinese Triads.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Then the killer Big Brother murdering innocent Koreans with a gun was reenacted by actors.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Finally, the terrible images of children becoming addicted to drugs were shown.</span></p><p><span style="">A voice narration flowed over it.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;They came to South Korea to commit crimes that they couldn&#x2019;t do in their own country.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The screen changed.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was the Death Circus, where people had to kill someone else to live.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Then the fanatics from cults were shown.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;To them, we are just toys that can be played with.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The narrator took a breath that allowed the viewers to focus on the images of the brutal crimes.</span></p><p><span style="">At that moment, the screen cracked.&#xA0;</span><span style="">No, it looked like it was broken.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Something white started to emerge on the black screen.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was the now familiar Phantom mask.</span></p><p><span style="">The voice narration stopped and music started playing.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Beethoven&#x2019;s Symphony No. 3, Heroic.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was the climax, causing an excited atmosphere.</span></p><p><span style="">Phantom spoke.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Everybody, I am sad. Before I knew it, this land has been filled with crimes committed by the Yakuza and the Triads. I remember the tragedy of T Medical Centre. They kidnapped the children and took their lives for their organs. That is why I punished them. Remember the case of the Chinese killer? He threatened me by holding innocent civilians hostage, so I judged him. However, the crimes by the mafia are still occurring. That is why I will give an order as Phantom. Leave this country right now. If you ignore the warning and invade my area---.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Phantom paused for a moment.</span></p><p><span style="">The screen turned black.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It faded out.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Soon, the music changed to Beethoven&#x2019;s piano sonata No.2.&#xA0;</span><span style="">And a phrase that would be remembered for a long time was heard.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;&#x2014; I will punish them!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The melody quieted while the people watching became excited.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The public started to pay attention to the movements of the criminal Phantom who judged other criminals.</span></p><p><span style="">@</span></p><p><i><span style="">-Did you see Phantom&#x2019;s video?</span></i> <i><span style="">It has already surpassed three million views on YouTube.</span></i></p><p><i><span style="">-Soy milk Phantom?</span></i></p><p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">I&#x2019;ve watched it over 100 times, and I had to change my panties three times.</span></i></p><p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">Isn&#x2019;t it very Korean?</span></i> <i><span style="">We no longer have any imports, so we are now importing criminals.</span></i></p><p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">Brothers, would you like to use this opportunity to change from a Hahoe mask to a phantom mask?</span></i> <i><span style="">Isn&#x2019;t a true Hallyu star born?</span></i><span style=""> &#x3147; &#x3147; &#x3147; &#x3148;! </span><i><span style="">Phantom!</span></i></p><p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">I will smile as the Yakuza and the Triads get what is coming to them.</span></i></p><p><span style="">The video of Phantom was uploaded to video sites and recorded millions of views in a single day.</span></p><p><span style="">Of course, among them...</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p>
