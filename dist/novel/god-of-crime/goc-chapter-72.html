<p>Chapter 72 - Huge Reward #1</p><p></p><hr><p></p><p><span style="">The man loved dolls.&#xA0;</span><span style="">To be precise, he wasn&#x2019;t interested in humans.</span></p><p><span style="">Or rather, he was disillusioned.&#xA0;</span><span style="">No matter how beautiful a person was, it was impossible for them to be perfect.&#xA0;</span><span style="">If he looked closely, then there were always flaws somewhere on the human body.</span></p><p><span style="">In fact, the man wasn&#x2019;t like that in the beginning.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He was someone who loved a woman.&#xA0;</span><span style="">She was L, a national actress.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He only saw her on TV, but the man thought of her as the ideal woman.</span></p><p><span style="">However, the man&#x2019;s love cooled down as there was a massive scandal that stirred the nation.</span></p><p>[Actress L&#x2019;s sex video leaked. National Actress has fallen?]</p><p><span style="">The man grew desperate, and he couldn&#x2019;t eat anything for a while.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It had been two weeks since he was pushed into this corner.</span></p><p><span style="">Suddenly, the world&#x2019;s interest in L disappeared, but the man couldn&#x2019;t give up.</span></p><p><span style="">Then he came to a realization.&#xA0;</span><span style="">If something went wrong, then he could replace it with something else.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The man loved dolls, and his specialty was in repairing them.</span></p><p><span style="">@</span></p><p><span style="">The Christmas party at the orphanage was finally settling down.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Everyone was playing happily, eating Tae-hyuk&#x2019;s food, and watching Christmas specials on TV.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Tae-hyuk laughed as he watched the way that the children were swarming to play with Santa Kang-suk.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;He is totally popular.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">He was so popular that little girls were standing in a line to marry him.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk sat in a corner and drank his canned coffee with a tired face.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He poured the can in his mouth and tasted a sweet liquid.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Kyah~&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk drank coffee with the atmosphere of a worker after a long night shift.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Can I sit down next to you for a while?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">It was a young woman who seemed to be in her late 20s.&#xA0;</span><span style="">She was a nun who cared for the children at St. Mary&#x2019;s Orphanage.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I am a guest here. Rather, I should be the one asking for permission.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;No. Everyone who comes here is the owner. Hello, I am Viviana.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Sister Viviana, I am Seo Tae-hyuk.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">She didn&#x2019;t seem to be a foreigner, so it seemed like Viviana was a baptismal name.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Viviana sat down next to Tae-hyuk and said,</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Praise Jesus. Thank you very much for coming today.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I just came to play with those two people. Kang-suk hyung said that he has already been sponsoring him for many years.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Viviana laughed.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was a modest face without any makeup, but he felt strangely calm when she talked.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I managed to operate this orphanage with the help of many people, and Cho Kang-suk is one of them.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">It was the first time that he had a conversation with a woman of this style.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Tae-hyuk, who became uneasy, spoke gruffly,</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I don&#x2019;t think you came here just to chat. What can I do for you?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Yes, in fact, I wanted to ask you something.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Well, if I can answer it then I will.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">At that moment, Viviana&#x2019;s face came close to him.&#xA0;</span><span style="">An oddly sweet fragrance was evident.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hum hum. I think your face is too close.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ah, I&#x2019;m sorry. The other children shouldn&#x2019;t hear this.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Then it can&#x2019;t be helped.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Viviana spoke in a low voice as if it was a forbidden story.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Do you perhaps know a girl called Kim Soo-bin?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk narrowed his eyes.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Why are you asking me that?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Oh, there isn&#x2019;t any strange meaning. I just asked because you seem to be a similar age.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Then I guess Soo-bin is a high school student.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes. A freshman. Ah, could you please wait a moment? A picture...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Viviana rummaged through her pockets and found a piece of paper.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Tae-hyuk coughed as he received the photo and opened it.&#xA0;</span><span style="">A girl with a cheerful atmosphere was seen with Viviana.&#xA0;</span><span style="">They looked like sisters, and were holding the V sign towards the camera.&#xA0;</span><span style="">At first glance, Kim Soo-bin was a girl with a short haircut like a man.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Do you know? Soo-bin is very pretty. If you see her then you would definitely remember.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Viviana seemed to really care about the children here.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I&#x2019;m sorry, but this is the first time I&#x2019;ve seen her. I&#x2019;m sorry I&#x2019;m not helpful.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Viviana&#x2019;s eyes widened and she waved her hands.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ah, no. I&#x2019;m sorry. You must been confused since I asked such a sudden thing.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk wanted to know why she was asking such a question.</span></p><p><span style="">This was an orphanage.&#xA0;</span><span style="">No matter how well the nuns took care of the children, they couldn&#x2019;t feel parental love and a sense of belonging.&#xA0;</span><span style="">There were those who wanted to leave here as quickly as possible.</span></p><p><span style="">In particular, the age of a high school student was the limit of staying in an orphanage.&#xA0;</span><span style="">So Soo-bin must have left here earlier than planned.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;She must have run away from home.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">A shadow crossed Vivian&#x2019;s face,</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes... Without saying a word to me...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Suddenly, Viviana grabbed Tae-hyuk&#x2019;s hand and spoke what was in her heart.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;If you see Soo-bin, then can your tell her that Sister Mom is waiting for her?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">She looked a little young to be called Mom, but he understood what she meant.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Viviana thought of the children here as her children.</span></p><p><span style="">It was at that moment.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Sister Viviana. You don&#x2019;t have to ask it from someone like that. Soo-bin unni graduated from here.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Viviana was filled with embarrassment.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;H-Hye-mi!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Hye-mi was a girl who seemed to be a middle school student.&#xA0;</span><span style="">She stared at Tae-hyuk like she wanted to eat him.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I don&#x2019;t like him. Are we beggars? Should I say thank you for buying chicken?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">She shook her head as if it was unacceptable.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Viviana stopped Hye-mi and said,</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I-I&#x2019;m really sorry. This child is called Song Hye-mi. She was close to Soo-bin so her nerves are sharp from Soo-bin&#x2019;s disappearance. At any rate, I am very thankful for today. If you see Soobin then please tell her that Mother is waiting.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk scratched the back of his head.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It seemed that the orphanage had complicated circumstances.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Can I hear more about this story?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">A hard-faced Santa Kang-suk was standing there.</span></p><p><span style="">@</span></p><p><span style="">After leaving Ha-ran in charge of the children, Viviana, Tae-hyuk, Cho Kang-suk and Hye-mi gathered in the reception room.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Before starting the story, Viviana spoke firmly with Hye-mi.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Hye-mi. You should just listen. Don&#x2019;t say anything to the detective. Do you understand?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Bah. Sister Mom doesn&#x2019;t have to worry. Am I a child?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Kang-suk removed the beard on his chin and said,</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Sister Viviana. Soo-bin is gone, what happened?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Viviana&#x2019;s voice trembled as she spoke.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Because she was so desperate, she told the story to Detective Kang-suk.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;It has been around a month since the day that Soo-bin went to school and didn&#x2019;t come back.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Kang-suk had already been doing volunteer work here for a few years and he knew most of the children.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He had known Soo-bin since she was a child,</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Why didn&#x2019;t you tell me this sooner?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Kang-suk asked angrily.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;T-That... I contacted Gangdong Police Station but you weren&#x2019;t there, so she was reported as missing.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ah... It was around that time.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Kang-suk sighed and leaned back in the chair.&#xA0;</span><span style="">A month ago, he had been unbelievably busy due to the Hippo case.&#xA0;</span><span style="">There was no way to get in contact with Kang-suk when the police station was called.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He gave his phone number exactly for situations like this.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Were they sorry about contacting a busy person?</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;The next time this sort of thing happens, please contact me straight away. It is absolutely no trouble. Hah... I heard that there were a lot of disappearances happening these days, but I didn&apos;t know it would happen around me.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk, who was listening to the side, interrupted the two people.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;If it was last month, was it after Actress Ryu Myung-hwa disappeared?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Kang-suk looked at Tae-hyuk with an expression of great interest.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;How do you know so well? That&apos;s right. Since then, the number of missing people have increased.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Aigoo...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk groaned.</span></p><p><span style="">He never dreamed that he would be involved in this incident.</span></p><p><span style="">Ryu Myung-hwa was one of the top three actresses.&#xA0;</span><span style="">She disappeared in the wake of a private video leaking.&#xA0;</span><span style="">There was speculation that she was staying quiet until the case was settled.&#xA0;</span><span style="">However, her agency then reported her missing.</span></p><p><span style="">From then on, the frequency of missing girls increased dramatically.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was the Werther Effect, so to speak.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was similar to the phenomenon where a spike in suicides occurred after a celebrity committed suicide.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was a word derived from the sorrowful protagonist of Goethe&#x2019;s novel, </span><i><span style="">The Sorrows of Young Werther,</span></i><span style=""> that was published in 1744.</span></p><p><span style="">He committed suicide after a tragic love.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was so popular that Napoleon also carried the book with him.&#xA0;</span><span style="">All over Europe, suicides started to spread as they imitated Werther.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The total number of deaths was over 2,000 people.</span></p><p><span style="">At present, the development in the media meant that it wasn&#x2019;t hard to find the Werther effect.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk bit his lip.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;If I remember correctly, this isn&#x2019;t just a simple missing persons case. Maybe...&apos;</span></p><p><span style="">He had a bad feeling.&#xA0;</span><span style="">For the first time, Tae-hyuk hoped that his thoughts were wrong.</span></p><p><i><span style="">Ddrrrung!</span></i></p><p><span style="">Someone&#x2019;s phone ringing interrupted Tae-hyuk&#x2019;s thoughts.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Ah, I&#x2019;m sorry. It is my phone. At such a late time...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Kang-suk pulled out his phone and confirmed who it was from.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He picked up the call and walked to a corner.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes, this is Cho Kang-suk.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">- ......</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;M-Mutilation... What is this...?!&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">- ......</span></p><p><span style="">He couldn&#x2019;t be sure of the conversation due to the distance.&#xA0;</span><span style="">However, Tae-hyuk didn&#x2019;t miss the words spoken by Kang-suk.</span></p><p><span style="">Mutilation murder.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Tae-hyuk bit his lip.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Damn... It actually is that case.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">His bad feelings were always right.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Cho Kang-suk approached them and said.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I&#x2019;m sorry but it seems like I have to go to work. I&apos;m sorry.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Ah, it&apos;s nothing.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I will come back tomorrow for more details. Tae-hyuk, Sister-nim, and Hye-min, I will be going now.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk spoke to the leaving Kang-suk in a quiet voice.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Hyung. Have you discovered a clue regarding the missing people?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;Ah. I&#x2019;ll tell you if there are more details.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk didn&#x2019;t miss Kang-suk&#x2019;s shaking.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The phone call was clear: A mutilated murder victim was found.&#xA0;</span><span style="">There was no harm in checking the identity against the missing people files at the police station.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Of course, the probability that the body was Soo-bin wasn&#x2019;t high.&#xA0;</span><span style="">However, it wasn&#x2019;t necessary to talk about the mutilation murder and make people uneasy.</span></p><p><span style="">This was why Kang-suk went to check without saying anything.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk was immersed in his thoughts as Kang-suk left.&#xA0;</span><span style="">This was a prelude to the brutal killings of a madman called Doll Play, but that was the extent of Tae-hyuk&#x2019;s knowledge on the matter.</span></p><p><span style="">Seo Tae-hyuk had memories of the future.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Until now, it had been easy to catch criminals using those memories.&#xA0;</span><span style="">However, this mutilation murder case was different.</span></p><p><span style="">&apos;In the end, the killer of this case wasn&#x2019;t caught.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">It ended with many victims.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Tae-hyuk only knew a rough outline of what was reported in the news.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The victims were only remembered with the initials A, B, and so on as they appeared in the news.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;There was an orphan among the identified victims...&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk felt like puking.</span></p><p><span style="">This was the first time.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The events so far had been easily solved using his memories of the future.&#xA0;</span><span style="">However, this time was different. &#xA0;</span><span style="">He knew nothing, and he couldn&apos;t do anything.&#xA0;</span><span style="">A sense of hopelessness filled Tae-hyuk&#x2019;s body.</span></p><p><span style="">Then an amazing thing happened.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Tae-hyuk gazed at what was written on the Demon Revealing Mirror.</span></p><p><span style="">[New mission: Find Doll Play.]</span></p><p><span style="">[The following rewards can be obtained by clearing the mission.]</span></p><p><span style="">-10 blacklist points</span></p><p><span style="">-20 stat points</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Wait. What? I can get all this by finding Doll Play?&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">It was literally a huge reward!</span></p><p><span style="">Blacklist points was one of the upgrade conditions.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He got one point every time he secured one member. In half a year, he had only collected 10 points.&#xA0;</span><span style="">In addition, stat points?&#xA0;</span><span style="">He could use it to raise his stats as he wished.&#xA0;</span><span style="">If he got all that...</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;I can clearly meet the conditions to upgrade my rank! I can be a Noble!&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk remembered something that he had forgotten for a bit.</span></p><p><span style="">He had two weapons.&#xA0;</span><span style="">But he had forgotten about one for a while.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Yes, I have the crime skills!&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">So far, he had only caught criminals that had already been arrested.&#xA0;</span><span style="">However, what about catching a criminal that hadn&#x2019;t been caught?</span></p><p><span style="">It was perfect for Tae-hyuk&#x2019;s purpose of changing his fate.&#xA0;</span><span style="">If this was possible, he would be able to change their fates.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk&#x2019;s eyes started to blaze with passion.</span></p><p><span style="">The God of Crime started to move in order to catch the strongest enemy that he had encountered so far.</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p>
